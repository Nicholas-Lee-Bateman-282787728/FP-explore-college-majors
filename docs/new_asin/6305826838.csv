1083509,5,6305826838,I watched this show as a kid and I just loved it. It is so much fun to go back and relive the shows you say back then. These two actors worked so well together.,1398816000,2,160,3.6
1083510,1,6305826838,The title is misleading.  These are select episodes from the first season etc.  No season 3 is included and there never was a season 4.,1199664000,,135,4.36

1083512,5,6305826838,"This is a great DVD to have. Although there are only four episodes on the disc, (not very good value) they have been 'colorized' it like they did with ""Bewitched - The First season"".

The DVD transfer is good. Not brilliant, but good. Picture is not as sharp as ""The Flying Nun"", ""Partridge Family"" and ""Brady Bunch"", but very watch able indeed. Well worth adding to your collection as it may be the only DVD version of these episodes in color. (The episodes on this disc were originally filmed in B&W)

Simple packaging with no inserts or inside pic. Menu is simple with no music. Weird episode selection. The highlight color is almost identical to the menu color, so it's hard to know what selection you're making.

I think this disc may well become a collector's item in years to come.

Do yourself a favour. You won't be sorry.",1191024000,,831,4.557046979865772
1083513,3,6305826838,"5 Stars for the show, one star for this DVD. My Favorite Martian is one of the all time good shows you and your family may enjoy.

But beware, this DVD only has 4 episodes on it. All 4 are contained in the 1st season set for only 11.00 more money. So instead of getting 4 shows for 13.00, you get 37 shows for 24.00. The title of vol. 3 & 4 is confusing. There is no vol. 3 & 4. Amazon needs to change it to reflect only 4 shows, which make the cost per show very expensive. Try the full season, you will be glad you did.",1171411200,18,521,3.779816513761468
1083544,4,6305826838,"MY FAVORITE MARTIAN was only on regular television for three years, but had a huge impact upon the popular culture of the time; it launched the careers of two actors and was one of the few shows that both fans of sci-fi and Westerns enjoyed.  The show starred Bill Bixby (who later went on to be David Banner in THE INCREDIBLE HULK) as Tim O'Hara, a low-rung journalist whose life changes forever when a flying saucer containing a Martian (Ray Walston) lands on the roof of the garage apartment he lives in.  The Martian's ship is severely damaged and he can't return home until he fixes his ship.  The Martian, who has powers of levitation and retractable antennae in his head, disguises himself as a human, moves in with Tim, and takes up the identity as his Uncle Martin.  Bixby and Walston have some amazing chemistry and had the duo worked in things other than this series, they could have been as big as Abbott and Costello or Burns and Allen.  Walston received a great deal of critical acclaim in life, but Bixby was a great actor who never did receive the acclaim and recognition he should have.

This DVD has four episodes all in color.  Each of the episodes revolves around Uncle Martin's time machine that he invented.  ""Go West Young Martian, Go West (parts 1 and 2)"" is a two episode story where Martin and Tim are sent back in time to St. Louis, Missouri in 1849.  However, the time machine is in California and the pair have to get their way there, but without changing history.  In ""Martin Meets His Match"" Martin brings back Leonardo Da Vinci to the present to assist Martin in working on his spaceship.  Finally, in ""Pay the Man the 24 Dollars"" Tim learns an important lesson about not messing around with history just to do historical research.

I enjoyed watching all four of these episodes.  They are only about 30 minutes in length each, so it takes around two hours to watch the entire DVD.  This is a great way to introduce someone to MY FAVORITE MARTIAN or as a token gift for fans of the original series.",1168905600,5,2030,4.5109289617486334
1083545,5,6305826838,"I really enjoyed those reviewed episodes in Colour, They truly stand the test of time. Very well written episodes by very sensible scientific minds. With the exception of the remake of ""My favourite martian"" by Disney, I've never seen Ray Walston starring in a Tecnicolor film. A very entertaining experience.",1131235200,,309,5.2
1083546,1,6305826838,"Season 3 was slated for an August 9 release... then, APPARENTLY, someone at Rhino got the bright idea to hold the release back indefinitely to shill this little 4-episode waste of money. My advice is... don't buy this. Make Rhino eat as much of the production cost as possible.",1128988800,29,277,4.673469387755102
1083547,1,6305826838,"This happens more often than not since the release of older tv shows on DVD has become popular.  The distributors such as Rhino suck us, the consumers into buying,as an example, seasons one and two of My Favorite Martian and anticipating the scheduled release date for season three.  Companies such as Amazon need to start holding the feet of companies like Rhino, to the fire and make them release what is promised on time.

1083550,5,6305826838,"I bought this on a whim and am I grateful. I had forgotten the charm, innocence and wisdom of Uncle Martin. Comparing it to some of the stuff of peddled today.

1083551,1,6305826838,"Notice how everything in the first episode or pilot is un-naturally rushed. Listen to the music. Check it's running time. Then check the running time of the additional episodes. The pilot 21 min. the others 25. Rhino has released this otherwise great show in a TAMPERED with digitally time compressed/edited version. All dvd collectors of classic t.v. want versions better, sharper and at the very least UN-CUT then those shown on Nick at Nite and T.V. Land. Rhino did us no favors with THE REAL McCOYS (EDITED), THE LONE RANGER (EDITED) and add to their list My Favorite Martian!",1046736000,10,580,4.8686868686868685
1083552,3,6305826838,"""My Favorite Martian"" is for Science Fiction what ""Bewitched"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"" are for Fantasy: a sitcom based in a fantastic scenario. Bill Bixby (later Doctor David Banner in ""The Incredible Hulk"" TV series) is Tim O'Hara, a journalist in which roof a flying saucer fells. The occupant of the saucer is a Martian with retractile antennae and the capacity to became invisible and levitate objects. Stranded in Earth, the alien is forced to disguise himself as O'Hara's Uncle Martin. For then on, O'Hara and Martin lives in a ""Odd Couple"" situation. The Martian's unfamiliarity with Earth customs provided much of the comic situations. The high point of ""My Favorite Martian"" was Ray Walston's characterization of Uncle Martin. The chemistry between Walston and Bixby was a decisive factor to the success of the series. Walston can be seen in 1999's big screen adaptation, as Uncle Martin's (Christopher Lloyd) fellow countryman, stranded here in Earth since the sixties. The series opened in 1963. The first two seasons were in black and white, and the third in color.",981072000,14,1077,5.056179775280899

7896386,5,6305826838,"This show is pure 60's fun.  I don't get the people who have given it low ratings.  It is not a modern sitcom so don't expect it to be.  The laugh tracks are pretty bad, it's in black & white, and the special effects are of that time not ours but it is still loads of fun.",1518480000,,272,3.736842105263158

7896392,5,6305826838,"The title ""My Favorite Martian"" popped into my head for some reason the other day.  I had seen this show in after-school re-runs, being a bit too young when it was originally aired, and loved it then.  Re-watching the past several days has reminded me of the other after-school TV fare I watched again and again growing up, like Gilligan's Island, Land of the Giants, and so many more.  It also reminds me what a much more polite, civil society we once lived in compared to today.",1506902400,6,480,4.494252873563219

I'm enjoying it as much the 2nd time around as the first.  There were alot of very quirky, fantastical comedies done for tv in the 60's since real life was so serious then (3 political assassinations, civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, etc.)....""My Favorite Martian, Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, The Munsters, Mr. Ed, Batman, My Mother the Car,"" etc. and many more....helped us escape from a crazy world for a little while.",1503532800,5,571,4.68

This is a very humane and moral comedy, written with a lot of intelligence behind it . It will make you laugh, but not in a stupid or painful way. Immersion in this series is sometimes more human than the human characters , because he understands from his prior experience with people how the world works. He is a very gentle but firm teacher  who almost never uses his abilities to dominate, instead educating the humans around him in ways to live a better life.
 I wish I could get this 10 stars , because it really deserves it.",1503532800,17,688,4.3671875
