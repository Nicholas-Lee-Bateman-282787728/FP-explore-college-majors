1877785,4,B000093NTL,"Fine arts photographer Jordan Donovan (Teri Polo), frustrated with a boyfriend (Greg Evigan) who won't commmit, is persuaded by her best friend to go along with a pretense. See, her friend had responded to an ad for a mail order bride and, in the correspondence, had passed herself off as Jordan. Now Jordan leaves the comforts and the slick of New York City and heads out west to Wyoming to meet surly cowboy Tyler Ross (Andrew McCarthy). But here's another kicker: it was Tyler's sister who had posted the ad, much to Tyler's dismay. Tyler had some time ago withdrawn from the world when his wife passed away, and he's just not that ready to let it go. So, predictably, it's an awkward first meet for Jordan and Tyler. She's dubious but is at least willing to play along. He doesn't even try. Initially.

STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART presents us with an unusual role for Andrew McCarthy, or so it seems to me. Andrew McCarthy as a man of few words and fewer smiles? That seems more implausible than, say, a mannequin coming to life or lugging around a dead guy and passing him off as still a breather. I haven't seen McCarthy in anything in years, but I remember him for those fidgety yuppie characters from ST. ELMO'S FIRE, LESS THAN ZERO, and WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. So it's jarring at first to see him playing against type, playing someone rugged and restrained and tall on a saddle. The years have added lines and wrinkles to his face and they flatter him. Andrew McCarthy looks the part of the weathered, morose horse rancher. He projects palpable sorrow and a world weariness and deep resentment. I guess he did shed his Brat Pack image after all.

I've always liked Teri Polo. There's just something so winning about her. I love that she always seems to be grounded no matter how wacky the film that she's in (MEET THE PARENTS and its sequels). STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART isn't one of them sweeping romances, per se. The mademoiselle doesn't catch the vapors. The gent doesn't indulge in grand gestures... well, okay, he does in the end. Mostly, the film takes its time. After all, he's a grieving widower and she's an unproven city slicker, a pesky, walking invasion of his privacy. But there's gratification in watching them engage in caustic sparring and shape a relationship and gradually develop a mutual attraction. I happen to think that the ending comes too abruptly; I guess I wanted to savor those closing moments a bit longer, even if the whole sequence is over-the-top. In a film filled with quiet little moments, I guess you're allowed one grand gesture.",1351296000,4,2565,4.672566371681416
1877786,5,B000093NTL,"If I had to pick my favorite film for a very long time this would have to be it.  The story is one of opposites meeting through the meddlesome sister and friend with one not knowing what the other has done.
The movie, although being filmed in California and not Wyoming as the story says is still filled with some very beautiful scenery.  The horses running across the open range are like poetry.  Andrew Mccarthy, one of my favorite actors is so handsome as a cowboy who wants nothing to do with Jordon  ( Teri Polo) and tries his best to ignore her and deny the feelings that come creeping into him.  His devotion to his wife who passed away a few years earlier is touching but almost cost him the love of a wonderful woman.  It was so well written and acted.  The casting was perfect.  It is a little pricey but to me worth it.  I just bought my second copy.  I always get a second copy of films I really like.  It doesn't hurt to have a spare in case you damage the first one.

Andrew McCarthy did a great job as the greiving widower who learns to love again, and Terri Polo was also good at showing the character of someone who learns what love is really all about.

I put the kids to bed, sent the husband off to work third-shift, made some popcorn and settled in for a good old fashioned romance -- and boy was I glad I did!  This is truly a great movie.  Yes, it can get a little corny here and there, but for the vast majority it was wonderful.  Teri Polo is your strong female lead with her flaws and all and Andrew McCarthy is your typical gruff cowboy-type who is mourning the loss of a wife and child who can't let go of the past to have a happy future.  Yes, it reads like a typical romance novel.  But that's the beauty of it, most novels like this don't translate well into film.  Now, I am not sure if this was based on a novel or not (if YOU know, could you please tell me) but either way, it's a well-written story with great acting, great chemistry, and absolutely beautiful scenery.

No. Therer are no geeks, nerds, trolls, whatever stupid hurtful words people wanna use, there's only 'people', and a person's heart is what counts, physical looks mean nothing, people should watch a movie called 'beastly' with vanessa hudgens, pretty good film with a great message, i hope people fill their hearts with love, the bible says God is love, and Jesus is God, so I hope they receive Jesus into their heart.",1331078400,,1602,4.343333333333334

1877833,5,B000093NTL,"We have owned this DVD for several months now and watched it again on Mother's Day sort of as a gift to mom. I might add, not only did she love it, so did we all!

The story involves two unhappy people living two entirely different lifestyles who have those who care about them wanting to help fix their lives. In both cases the well-meaning relative/friend decides to either place or answer an ad in a magazine for those seeking a spouse. This is done without the two unhappy people even knowing anything was afoot.

It all works out that the girl, a New Yorker, is persuaded to journey to Wyoming to meet the boy, a rancher, mostly to satisfy the friend.

What happens then is the core of the story and easily holds one's attention; there is misunderstanding, conflict, surprises, and joy; the scenery is majestic and contributes to the joy of simply watching the story unfold.

The rancher is still suffering the loss of his wife who died at the birth of their child and is very busy blaming himself for what happened. It so happens that the rancher is skilled as a horse-whisperer and trains horses using this technique; there are many scenes of horses running against magnificent backgrounds as well as a ""joining-up"" scene where a wild horse finally accepts the horse-whisperer.

By way of summary, the movie is captivating and persuasive; it provides a nice evening's entertainment! I recommend it highly.",1273449600,6,1412,4.723577235772358

1877841,3,B000093NTL,"I ordered this DVD on-line based on the amazing reviews it got here on Amazon.com without ever having seen it. I have to say, this is a very cute and wholesome story and I'm pleased to add it to my collection. However, I didn't see it as the 5 star film most everyone else did.

First of all- the good points. I thought Andrew McCarthy did a fine job of illustrating a broken widower. He was appropriately ""manly"" about his pain which was both tender and wrenching. Also, he played a rancher, which of course gave him an ever ""manlier"" edge. Not comfortable with sharing emotion, he is tough and rough and sharp.

Teri Polo was okay as the New Yorker who travels to the midwest based on a singles ad that her friend answered.

One of the things that bothered me was that neither character could accept the singles ad. Was that not PC enough for America? What's the problem there? She had to have a friend do it and he had to have a sister do it. I thought it would have been nice if one of them were actually responsible for being there. Both made a big deal of rejecting responsibility for wanting to be there. He didn't want her at all (it was a deal with his sister) and she was... what? On a fling to defy her boyfriend?

Long story short- the movie was great in many ways. The scenery was amazing. I loved the substory- the wild horses. (Even though the ""taming"" method was ridiculous.) I LOVED the sister and her story.

I guess it comes down to the biggest complaint. I felt zero chemistry from the two main characters. It was SO wholesome. I don't want to spoil the ending at all. But basically, I rolled my eyes. I didn't feel it at all or believe it. And trust me, I'm not asking for anything raunchy. (My fave movie is Anne of Green Gables!)

1877852,5,B000093NTL,"I just loved this clean, and romantic love story, about a handsome Wyoming rancher(Andrew McCarthy), named Tyler, and a beautiful New York photographer, named Jordan! Jordan (Teri Polo), just broke up with her handsome, longterm boyfriend Edward(Greg Evigan),because he was not ready to get married!

 Jordan's friend Carla(Christine Tucci) answered a single's ad about a rancher looking for a wife, in Jordan's name, from the Country Connections magazine! Tyler Ross's engaged sister, Laurie(Patricia Kalember)placed the ad in the magazine in Tyler's name, as part of a deal that Tyler agrees to meet one woman, that Laurie fixes him up with, and in return Laurie would agree to stop trying to fix up Tyler with women! Laurie answers Carla's ad for Jordan, and sends a airplane ticket in Tyler's name.

Carla talks Jordan into going to Wyoming to meet Tyler, and Tyler meets Jordan at the airport. Jordan and Tyler end up not liking each other, Tyler thinks she is a big city snob, and Jordan thinks he is a dumb country hick! The ice between Tyler and Jordan starts to thaw as they learn more about each other! Jordan learns about Tyler's passion for saving and protecting the wild horses, that roam the area from being sold and killed, and slaughtered, and Jordan tries to help him. Jordan is amazed with Tyler's gentle way with horses, and she takes some amazing photographs, that earns her, her own showing at a New York gallery.

 At Laurie's beautiful country wedding, Tyler starts to realize his attraction for Jordan, when other guys ask her to dance, but he is afraid of getting hurt and betraying his wife's loving memory. And Tyler keeps pushing Jordan away, while she falls more in love with him!

I loved the breathtaking, beautiful scenery, in this movie. It is one of the most beautiful places that I have ever seen. And I loved Tyler and Laurie's beautiful home in the mountains of Wyoming! But one of my favorite things was the small old timey, beautiful church and Laurie's wedding reception, I just loved it, it was perfect!

I love a cute, clean romantic movie, and Hallmark produces some very sweet stories, but this movie just didn't do anything for me, despite all the rave reviews that led me to watch the film.  The character Andrew McCarthy plays consistently acts in an ungentlemanly, rude manner.  If I--like Teri Polo's character--flew across the country to visit a man and he treated me that way, I would have been flying home the next day.  Teri Polo's original boyfriend in the beginning of the movie is portrayed as being a loser who's afraid of commitment, but by the end of the movie I was rooting for him instead of for McCarthy.  Boyfriend #1 learns a lesson and realizes that he needs to commit, but does McCarthy ever realize how rudely he acted?  I understand that he was grieving his first wife, but that's no excuse for lack of kindness and hospitality.  The characters in this movie just weren't gripping or memorable and I didn't sense much chemistry between the actors, though I'm glad that others enjoyed the movie.  In the movie's favor, there were many witty lines that made me laugh.  I also like that the movie emphasized the importance of commitment and marriage.

1877857,5,B000093NTL,"STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART is a romance. The DVD cover photo tells you that. It's a horse movie, the cover tell you that too.  So it's predictable.  The good looking gal will get the handsome cowboy in the end. And they'll be riding horses, and there will be wild horses, and beautiful western country. The predictability merits only 4-stars.

A man gets information sent to a match-making company by someone else.
A woman has the same thing happen to her, via a friend.
The two queries get matched and presto-change-o; Bob's your uncle.
At first they seem opposites......then......predictable.
Done well but still only 4-stars worth.

BUT THEN:

The story keeps moving and offers some good moments throughout, accomplished through dialogue between 2 characters sharing in settings from a corral, or a country church, to a NYC flat, and the open range.  Hallmark Entertainment makes sure what you see is pleasingly enjoyable.

Next, the proposal, you just know eventually will come from the cowboy, Tyler Ross (Andrew McCarthy), arrives in an uncharacteristic way, very UNpredictable.  Of course Jordan, city gal (Teri Polo) accepts, again predictable. But: Then at the finale, the friend, Carla, ends the film's dialogue with a great line.

Hallmark's excellence and the ending shoots this predictable romance to 5-star good. So guys, sit back with some good spicy beef jerky, put your arm around your gal, and enjoy the romantic ride.",1245974400,5,1433,5.115879828326181

Teri Polo and Andrew McCarthy were excellent. The scenery in Wyoming was typically Hallmark beautiful. The story was great (almost a 'mail order bride') story. Two people coming from very different parts of the country and with very different backrounds, trying to be 'matched up' by their own friends, not themselves, made for a great story. I haven't seen Andrew McCarthy in years. He looks better in this film than I've ever seen him before. And, as with most Hallmark films there is no violence that I wouldn't have a 5 year old watch.

The movie however, fell short of the mark. The chemistry between McCarthy and Kalember wasn't strong. What makes a good romantic movie into a great romantic movie are several elements. The couple has to overcome several odds to be together.  One being emotional distance, that was apparent, especially in McCarthy's character, the other would be a physical rival for the affections of one or both of the main characters. Greg Evigan tried to play that role, but he was barely on the screen, therefore, his character was not used effectively and lastly, strong physical desire. With McCarthy's character constently trying to keep his distance from Kalember's character, the physical part was not that obvious.

Tyler agonizes over the loss of his wife and daughter, and Jordan realizes she has developed very deep feelings for Tyler. Edward finds Jordan, finally asks her to marry him, and she returns to New York. At last, Jordan comes to her senses and tells Edward she cannot marry him - because she would always be waiting for time when he would decide he did not want to be married.(Hooray!

It's not all that great of a film, but it is worthwhile anyway.  That needs an explanation, so bear with me.  It certainly is easy to watch.  I think great film or not, it goes down easily and becomes a casual pleasure.

The story is the basis for a romantic culture clash.  Jordan Donovan (Teri Polo) is a photographer from New York City.  She's tired of the typical treadmill of romance.  In both aspects of her life she is trying to break through.  Her arty exhibits of (literally) garbage fail to spark interest for a sponsor of photography exhibits.  Meanwhile, her love interest,  Edward, has been dating her for years, but refuses to make a commitment.  Her roommate, Carla, (Christine Tucci) is presented like a half-funny, but easily as likable Rhoda.  She plays matchmaker by signing her up for `Cowboy Connections,' a magazine with a ""Personals"" column designed to hook up couples out West.

All too neatly, Carla has taken the liberty of not only putting her friend's name in the magazine, but writing her background and answering any prospects that come to her.  On Jordan's birthday, she not only has a man, but a plane ticket for her to join him at his ranch in Wyoming.  Cynically, she, nevertheless, does what most people would do at the prospect of adventure:  She accepts both as a present.

Even more neatly, Tyler Ross (Andrew McCarthy) has a doting sister named Laurie (Patricia Kalember) who answers his personal ads for him.  Jaundiced about dating again, he doesn't think much when she calls to tell him a woman from NYC is coming to his ranch.  Something must stir inside him, for we discover earlier it is he who provides the plane ticket.

Her arrival is not a friendly one.  Quickly, the resentment pours through:  At breakfast he tartly announces that they don't serve ""espresso"" at the morning table.  Later, when she's falls off a horse, he nastily chides,  ""I don't want some big city lawyer trying to sue me.""  She understandably doesn't allow herself to be a walking mat.  She has some counter resentments to offer:  going toe-to-toe she has plenty to say about cholesterol soaked breakfasts and his backward behavior.  Yet, she has a background that he doesn't even consider, and as the movie unfolds, she has several opportunities to prove herself more than a typical city slicker.

Across the way former friend, Mr. Jameson, is brazen about trespassing on Tyler's land to capture wild mustangs for his own use.  United Tyler and Jordan try to oppose his lawless horse trade while working out some terms of bitterness found in everyone's past.

Some of the appeal of the movie is the scenery.  Mustangs rush past with autumnal mountain horizons while the pair take on the work of the land.  The old-fashioned Western score by Mader is superb for the laid back adventure, and the tenderness of key scenes works its way incrementally as it goes along.

Pleasant, enjoyable, and easy-going like a trek to Wyoming itself,  `Straight from the Heart' may not have the best performances, nor the most original dialogue, but it is still a pleasurable film trek anyway.  While I thought throughout the ""torn between two lovers"" scenario Jordan deserved better choices, who's to judge about taste if a relationship has a chance to work?  After all, sometimes even a two-star film is all we really need.",1185062400,28,3823,4.763719512195122

Teri Polo is so beautiful; I love her facial expressions.  Even though there are no blatant love scenes, there was a definite attraction between the two, especially in the dance scene, the barn scene with the blanket wrap, and the ending with the bride price.

Andrew McCarthy is utterly convincing as the blunt, hurting, and rough-edged cowboy she finds there, and the chemistry between them, clear from their second scene together, is so exquisite you could cut it with a knife.

1877911,2,B000093NTL,I bought this movie based on the rave customer reviews.  This definitely isn't a family-friendly or moral story.  The lead actress is from New York and is proposed to move in with her long time boyfriend.  The only reason she doesn't like the idea is because she wants a greater commitment (marriage) but not because she feels moving in is wrong.  Also a friend encourages her to lie non-chalantly at one point when she feels out of place in Wyoming.  We bought the movie on the pretense that there were no cuss words but H*** and D*** were sprinkled throughout the movie and only took away from what could've been a decent film.  Even outside of the non-family values and cursing it was slow moving.,1169510400,11,700,4.56

The loss of Tyler's wife and infant daughter during childbirth has left him alone and unwilling to look ahead to a possible life with another woman. While their initial meeting is less than warm, the road leading to their ""reawakening to life""  is filled with trials, that the viewer will want to find out how they overcame them. The film beautifully brings to life the mountainous lands of the west, the flowing rivers and natural wildlife.  You feel like you're a part of the action and you find yourself totally involved with the families, both trying to make heads or tails of their situations.

1877928,5,B000093NTL,"The plot of ""Straight From The Heart"" revolves around two distinct lies, yet somehow it works. The character of Tyler Ross is one which was difficult to make believeable and sympathetic, but Andrew McCarthy makes Tyler exactly what the story line requires. He is downright magnetic!

  Teri is so naturally pretty, and she is at her peak in this one. Her character of Jordan Donovan is accomplished, self-assured and sophisticated. She is all that but also vulnerable. She is thrown into a situation not of her own making, travelling from NYC to Wyoming into what seems, at first, like a whole new planet. However, the on-screen chemistry between McCarthy and Polo is obvious right from the beginning. The story takes twists and turns to a truly romantic ending.

  Why these actors didn't make it bigger in movies is a mystery to me. Teri Polo is certainly so much prettier and a far better actress than the likes of Jennifer Aniston (not pretty, can't act), Ashley Judd (pretty, can't act), Sarah Jessica Parker (not pretty, can act a little), etc. I would far rather see Polo anytime. McCarthy is, in a word, superb.

  Well written, well directed, very well edited, and extremely well acted, ""Straight From The Heart"" deserves its place on a permanent shelf of really good movies.

  Except for too loud ""fakey"" horse noises at times, the sound tract is excellent. In spots, the mix is especially terrific! The scenery is beautiful; so, all in all, this movie is one which can be watched over and over again without boredom. It is definitely on my list of ""Favorites.""

I particularly appreciated the cinematography and settings, and well... okay. I really appreciated Andrew McCarthy in his jeans. :) As a mustang adopter and advocate, I can't say that the depiction of mustangs and the BLM (called the ""DLM"" in the film) is really terribly accurate, but I'm EXTREMELY gratified to see a film even approaching the question of wild horse management in such a positive way. (Of course, when it comes to training mustangs, I wouldn't try this at home; while we see Tyler using some pretty decent training methods, he's also working with a domestic quarter horse rather than a range-fresh mustang; the real thing doesn't tend to go that fast or easy. ;))

I think they did a nice job of making the characters both believable and likeable, and the various conflicts and situations actually make sense, unlike too many films where things could just be resolved if the characters would stop behaving like morons. :) Andrew McCarthy does a really nice job as a gruff cowboy type... and he certainly sits a horse well, too.",1132704000,146,1377,4.59349593495935

The color, the scenery, the horses - everything in the movie tuggs at the heart. Tenderly attacks the senses and leaves one with a feeling of love.

So many actors can't portray the tenderness and sorrow needed for a stong love story.  Wow!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- if you miss this one - you have denied yourself something special.",1101168000,394,726,4.565891472868217

1877953,5,B000093NTL,"With my apacolyptic world view with the evolutionary dailliance of Homo sapiens leading to certain planetary sucicide I found this film to be wholesome and uplifting rather than the usual American video presentations of violence,drugs,meaningless sex, models to bring out the worst in human behavior including our public school system students,horror etc.

I could find nothing to criticize in this film.

The acting, cinematography,music, and story were superb.

A major theme was the relentless task of dealing with catastrophic loss in a constructive way and moving on to new authentic relationships and finding ""your people.""

The film also had many humorous and poignant scenes.

The contrast of Wyoming with NYC was of special interest to me.

I'm from back East, and have lived in Wyoming for almost fifteen years and before that Montana.

This cinema reminded me of two French films ""Blue"" and ""Red"" from The Three Colors series by a Polish director.

Here again was the issue of surving and coping major unexpected loss or losses.

The answers again included personal courage and finding ""your world of decent caring people"".

There no DVD after""Things I never told you. "" So, kind of worry about him. But recently I found his H.P and his new movies. So I ordered this DVD right away!! I couldn't belive that he never rode a horse before take this movie. He tried to hard practice didn't he? He had only 2 weeks that I heard. So I think , Well ""great"" done!!Teri Polo is very simmler looks as Jodie Foster and Helen Hunt,so I thoght her caractor is also bright and frank.@But At the end,I have to say that I fell sorry for she was a very bad kisser, and also I apologize to uncorrect spelling and sentences .",1091664000,26,724,4.06993006993007

This movie has humour, sadness, thoughtfulness and romance. The scenery is breathtaking and the filming was excellent. BUY this movie, it's a keeper. I've had it 6 weeks and watched it 12 times.",1086825600,17,372,4.567164179104478
1877957,3,B000093NTL,"I just saw this movie last night.  I enjoyed the romance but found the horse ""training/whispering"" scenes very cliche.

As someone who owns and works with horses herself, I get very frustrated with Hollywood's romanticized and inaccurate portrayal of methods used to train horses as well as ""Disneyfied"" depictions of horse behavior.

Teri Polo and Andrew McCarthy had very good chemistry, I thought.  I did think it was a little much when she kept tagging along on their rides out into the countryside and she kept 'screwing up' for one reason or another (three times, I think it was).

Watch this movie for the love story but not the horses!",1076630400,4,643,4.8090909090909095

7988906,1,B000093NTL,"I totally agree with the majority of the one star reviews!  I would never pay that kind of money for a low budget, made for TV, chick flick! If it were an award winning first rate, first run movie or complete set of a TV series...then I would consider it! Heck...I only paid $55.00 for the complete anniversary set of the 50th anniversary of Gone With The Wind & it cane in a beautiful red velvet box with a dvd of extras plus a dvd of the enhanced movie plus books & movie cards! Someone who would pay over $10. for dvds like this have nothing else to do with their money or too much money to care plus too much time on their hands! I really wanted to buy this movie, one for me & one for a friend but never ever at these prices! The movie it self is very good in the way of the traditional Chick Flick but a lot better written! Its sad to see this much charged for this movie!  Lower the price,drastically & Ill buy it! But I am going to look elsewhere!!!",1514332800,,957,4.031578947368421
