622667,5,6303317340,This movie is very moving and inspiring. I first saw in the 6th Grade after reading the diary for the 10th time. The acting is very belivable. As is the script.

622668,4,6303317340,"When I saw this 1959 production recently, I was as enthralled as I was years ago.  This time, however, it was not Shelly Winters or Lou Jacobi who impressed me, but Joseph Schildkraut, who's portrayal of Otto Frank makes  the entire film plausable.  His iron will along with Anne's love of life,  hold the group together.  This film still holds viewers interest today,  despite the heavy handed used of violins marking the most poignant moments.",931824000,,445,4.866666666666666

622778,5,6303317340,"It's a great film. A film of it's time - it's a little romanticized and based on a play - but still honest and heartfelt.  The director was a changed man after returning from WW2 after witnessing and documenting first hand the liberation of many concentration camps.  This was his response to what he saw in Europe.  It's an understated, sad elegant film with great performances.

One thing though, there are a bad one star reviews here that mention that the film is defective because when it first starts the screen is black and all you hear is music.  I'm amazed that people don't read the menus or maybe just skip forward. What they saw was what was done back when the film was released - there was entrance music played when the theatre was dark and before the titles began.  This lasts approx. 5 minutes and then the film proper begins.",1501286400,,841,4.5

622830,5,6303317340,"I foolishly avoided watching this film several times after checking it out at the local library, because the cover of the DVD made it look boring. Like taking foul-tasting supplements, I figured that a watch of this film would be good for me, but an unpleasant experience. I could not have been more wrong.

It's Based On The Play, Not the Book

In grade school I read the play that this film is based on for my English class. It left me deeply moved. I cried tears. I tried to tell other people about how it made me feel. Their reaction was similar to what many people are saying about this film ""It's not the book. You should read the book. The book is better."" I won't say that these people are necessarily wrong, but their statements are deeply misleading. One is a book written by a girl in the midst of a world gone mad. The other is a film that dramatizes her experience to give it dramatic weight in film form. It's apples and oranges. Beyond that, statements that someone should avoid The Secret of NIMH, or Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind, or Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice, or this film because ""the book is better"" are akin to stabbing your eyes out because you think hearing is better than seeing. BOTH have value. Films as a rule MUST be different from a book the same way that a play is different from a book, they reach out to the senses differently and must be structured to use their unique advantages.

The Third Man

All that said I remember reading the screenplay for The Third Man (also in grade school) and then seeing the film and hating it. It wasn't as good as the screenplay in my mind. Then I grew up and rewatched the film and realized the genius of its cinematography, acting, and direction. Well, I may have had The Diary of Anne Frank ruined for me a bit by already reading the actual diary, AND reading the play before watching, but I was still awestruck by what a great film this is.

The Full Might of Old Hollywood

Okay, I admit it. I had no idea the pedigree of talent that was in this film until I actually watched it. Shelly Winters gets all the credit from the critics again (I remember her in A Patch of Blue, another film that everyone should see, because Elizabeth Hartman gives an absolutely mind-blowing performance as a blind girl and the GREAT Sidney Poitier astounds), but the OTHER actors in this film are the reason to watch it. Millie Perkins portrayal as the young Anne Frank appears to be quite divisive. Some people can't get over the ""she's too old"" argument that should cause they to avoid The Wizard of OZ as well, and there's some talk that her performance is flat. I'm with the people who say that she deserves an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Her portrayal is understated in quiet moments, lively in moments of conflict, and she is very much in character (and you CARE about her, or at least I did). Shelly Winters is good, but I'm not a big fan of her acting style so...yeah. It's wonderful to see the usually comic Ed Wynn in a serious role, and he nails it. Richard Beymer is awesome as always (I hope I'm not the only one who LOVED him in West Side Story). And Diane Baker... Oh My God. Seriously? She's in 300 Spartans? AND Journey To The Center Of The Earth? AND this movie!?!? Her acting is superb, her beauty is unmatched, and she embodies the Rutger Hauer/Alan Arkin effect (having a supporting role in ANY film raises it two stars).

The Real Star is the Film-Craft

Let's be honest. This is a THREE HOUR movie set pretty much entirely in AN ATTIC. For most films that would be absolute suicide as the audience dies of boredom no matter how awesome and moving and dramatic the subject-matter. Thankfully, this issue is EASILY side-stepped by the fact that some of the greatest film-makers to ever live worked on this film. First, the director. George Stevens. Yes THAT George Stevens, of GIANT and Gunga Din fame. He works with William C. Mellor (cinematographer of GIANT) and there's camerawork by the unparalleled Jack Cardiff (the greatest cinematographer to ever live). The opening minutes of this film had me feeling like I was watching a Michael Powell/Archers Production like A Canterbury Tale or  I Know Where I'm Going. There's also an INCREDIBLE score by Alfred Newman (too many great film scores to name) that is WORTH sitting through both in the introduction and closing. All of this combines to make this a master class in film making.

Honestly, I've been watching films all my life and I take them very seriously. I think this is one of the greatest, most under-rated films of all-time. It is a quiet epic, but an epic non-the-less. It's warm, beautiful, gripping, and heart-breaking. It will draw you in and change your view of life. For lovers of great film that tell great stories (and aren't depressing) I cannot recommend this film more highly.

Spoilers:

Unlike other versions of the story which end with death in a concentration camp, this version flashes forward from Discovery by the Nazis to the lone survivor of the Frank family reading the final words in the Diary of his daughter. This is a far better ending and reading it in the play stayed with me my entire life.

Anne's Voice from The Diary: ""Despite Everything I still believe that people are good at heart.""
Otto Frank: ""She puts me to shame.""

622836,2,6303317340,"I have never been a huge fan of this movie. I find Anne super annoying in the beginning, in the style of an annoying kid sister, and I think this film's major blunder is turning this movie into a love story. Anne's diary was not a love story. Yes, she did feel she loved peter, but the book was more than that. It was about a young girl, wanting so badly to be free and being jailed in this building. She couldn't leave it, or look out the windows or see her friends or go to school or anything. She was curious about her body, depressed over her situation, and an aspiring writer. I know it was the 1950s and they couldn't show these things, but they turned a perfectly good story into this love story at heart.

622934,5,6303317340,"This is one of my favorite movies, period. I know a lot of people view this and say, 'Things were much more dire than what they show in this movie,' and they're correct. Since this movie was released, we've seen a movie such as Schindler's List come out and it paints a more realistic portrait of what happened to the Jewish community during the Holocaust. However, at the time The Diary of Anne Frank came out, people would not have been able to handle the ""realistic"" portrayal of Anne and her family and friends.

The Diary of Anne Frank is a movie that should not be ignored. As a young person when I first saw this movie, I had the opportunity to read The Diary of Anne Frank in school. Between reading it and seeing the movie, I felt the immense sorrow and pain this particular group of people had to endure at a very horrific time in the history of mankind. To stay in hiding 24 hours a day; limited resources; seeing the same faces day-after-day; wondering about your future, daydreaming of a better time, or if you'd come out alive.

I suggest you take time to read the book. [NOTE: Not the book that has updated information in it. I'm appalled that the main focus of the company who re-released it points out that Anne 'explores her sexuality.' No-no!!! Read the classic and ignore the newest version.] Then, try to see this movie. The Diary of Anne Frank is safe for children ages 11 and up. In fact, this would be a good introduction for a younger audience about the German occupation and Nazi Germany.

Also of note: after seeing Anne Frank, I recommend seeing The Hiding Place (also the book of the same name) about the story of Corrie ten Boom.",1454889600,8,1659,4.4506578947368425

This is a real significant story that needs to be told ... but this film loses message by mass over-sentimentalization. Nor does it tell anything about the ramp up or what happens after the raid.

 The Diary of Anne Frank is a very mixed bag of a film. I watch it from time to time and enjoy it for the details straight out of the book and the historical value but there are a few things that detracted me from giving it four or five stars. It is brilliantly shot and won a richly deserved Oscar for the cinematography (I'll get to that later) and the score is very beautiful and elegant but a movie needs more than great cinematography and music. It needs great screenwriting (which is fairly good) but it also needs great acting and that it what The Diary of Anne Frank lacks a lot of.

There are some lackluster performances but mostly glaring at Millie Perkins as Anne. She isn't exactly terrible but you can tell she doesn't have that level of authority and experience that really good, trained experienced players have--hardly surprising since she was a clothing model instead of an actress and I've got a feeling George Stevens (director) cast her more for her looks than abilities. She is fine when not pushed to do too much but her weak nasally voice is unappealing and her off-screen narrations are almost intolerable to listen to because she says almost all her lines in the exact same monotone mouth-open mouth-shut cadence. Richard Beymer and Ed Wynn (Peter and Mr. Dussell) play their parts rather dully and leave a gray, colorless impression on the screen. Dodie Heath and Douglas Spencer are slightly better as Miep and Mr. Kugler.

On the upside though, are the outstanding performances of Joseph Schildkraut and Gusti Huber as the noble, Christ-like, salt-of-the-earth Mr. and Mrs. Frank and it's a shame they didn't get the supporting actor/actress nominations instead of Ed Wynn and Shelley Winters. They play their roles with such exquisite finesse and subtlety and do so much more with one facial expression than Perkins and Beymer do with a whole script. My favorite of their scenes are:

1. When Mr. Frank stops Anne from looking out a window. ""No! No! You must never touch a window! Never! If anyone outside were to see us all would be lost and remember it's not just our lives at stake but Miep and Mr. Kraler. This is the way we must live until it is over if we are to survive.""
2. Mr. and Mrs. Frank's recitation of the scriptures at the Hannakuh celebration. Love the sound of their voices.
3. Mr. Frank's tense, determined look when he's behind the door with a hammer when the thief comes in.
4. Mrs. Frank seething with righteous anger at Mr. van Daan for stealing food.
5. The way Mr. Frank says as the Nazi's are breaking in ""For two years we have lived in fear. Now we can live in hope.""
Shelley Winters plays the temperamental, fussy Mrs. Van Daan and even though I would not have given her the Oscar she won, she does what she can with her role. Lou Jacobi is also very good as her slovenly husband and their arguments are hilarious. Diane Baker gives a nice, smooth, polished performance as Margot and her voice is very soft, rich and soothing--she'd be a better Anne any day than Millie Perkins.

The screenwriting hits the highlights of Anne's life and does a good job showing the struggle of the two families to get along with very little personal space but to be fair it could do with a little cutting for time's sake. I could probably have shortened it down to two hours and not done it any harm.

William C. Mellor's black and white cinematography is terrific, wonderful shades of black, gray and white, just the right amount of light and darkness. Some of the camera work actually looks like Citizen Kane and that's saying a lot.
1. The shot looking up the stairs and ceiling at the beginning when Mr. Kraler and Miep find Mr. Frank has come home again looks a bit like the shot where Charles and Emily are going up the stairs to Susan's apartment at the beginning of the blackmail scene.
2. Some up and down shots of the spice factory workers on the first floor, Miep and Kraler on the second floor and the families in the attic resemble the ascending shot on stage during Susan's opera performance.
3. When the bombs are going off, the families go up to the top and look out the skylight at the several airplanes and airport light columns in the sky. The columns eventually form together in rays, then we see the light of a candle in the middle and then the shot pulls away and we see the rest of the candle in the middle of the table at Hannukah--an awful lot like the falling snow in a Xanadu palace window that shows a little house and then pulls away where see it is a globe in the beginning `Rosebud' scene!

Taken as a whole, this is an allright adaption of Anne Frank's diary but it could have been better. I recommend it--just don't expect a masterpiece.",1391558400,,5160,4.653128430296378

623820,5,6303317340,"The tragic story of Anne Frank is given big screen treatment thanks to director George Stevens and his impressive cast.  Equal parts dramatically intense and sincerely intimate; there is a fine line that needed to be drawn in order to convey this tale without trivializing the source material.  By scaling things back and giving us a more naturalized progression of events, Stevens was able to muster up a bold and heavy hitting biopic that feels close to our hearts.

The film follows the events chronicled in Anne Frank's diary, which had been adapted previously as a stage play.  This story works perfectly in that setting, as everything is basically a collection of conversations that revolve around one specific room.  As a film, it also works thanks to the approach that Stevens took with building tension slowly and drawing on the obvious drawbacks to stuffing too many people in such a small space.  Really though, it is the group of actors who make this film work.  If it hadn't been for their devoted performances, this film would have failed to deliver the needed emotional swells that cause it to flutter in our hearts.  There are few stories that elicit such frustrated feelings as that of poor Anne Frank, and yet Stevens' ability to scale back the impact of this film allows us to focus on the story being told and not the overwhelming frustration that her story so often brings.  Millie Perkins, Joseph Schildkraut, Shelly Winters (who won an Oscar for her performance), Diane Baker and the rest of the cast really deliver on all levels here.

It's beautifully composed and delivered to the audience in a way that is digestible yet earnest; honest and authenticated.  This story has been told a few times, but I firmly believe that Stevens' 1959 film is the finest adaptation.  It is dark, tragic and melancholy and yet it thrives in a message of hope that Anne Frank left behind; a beautiful burst of insight that we all do well to consider.",1336435200,,1958,4.777448071216617
623821,2,6303317340,"This is a story that should be fail-proof.
The Broadway production ran for years and based on an actual diary of a tragically young Jewish girl, Anne Frank, who writes of the terror of having to hide from the Getaspo Death Squad.

Switch to l958 when famed movie director, George Stevens, launches one of the most absurd international talent hunts for a girl who would star in the title role of his movie ""Anne Frank"" that echoed the equally absurd talent search launched by Otto Preminger for his abysmal movie flop, ""St. Joan."" (Preminger found finally a midwestern young girl, Jean Seberg who was so embarassing to watch that it's one of the most true cringe-worthy movie experiences in history).

Millie Perkins was finally awarded the role. Director Stevens claims he considered resumes of thousands and auditioned hundreds of would-be hopefuls. When we see the movie today, Anne Frank looks and sounds like the New York fashion model that Perkins was in real life. Her hair is cut in a fashionable l959 do. She looks as healthy as an American fashion model. She emotes with all the emotion and passion of a fashion model between breaks of a photo shoot.

No matter how hard the talented cast works, the colorless, flat presence of a pretty young American girl, who looks like she never missed a meal in her life, destroys the whole mood.
I believe this internatioanl talent search finally ended this really wacky way of drumming up publicity and interest in a movie project.

Of course, David O. Selznick started this PR gimmick with his search for the perfect young woman to portray Scarlett O'Hara in a certain little independent movie called GONE WITH THE WIND. He never considered seriously any of the unknowns who were eventually screentested but when Vivien Leigh just happened to appear, with her new agent, Myron Selznick, for the big burning of Atlanta sequence, David Selznick looked no more.  In this case, his choice was no inexperienced unknown who modeled gowns.",1335571200,2,1982,4.869436201780416

They show a canal, a truck carries passengers. A man enters a house and climbs the stairs. Bells are rung. Mr. Otto Frank is home. A couple tells him they saved his papers, and Anne's diary. He reads it. The story tells of the restrictions on Jews during the Nazi occupation. The Frank family goes into hiding with extra clothes. ""Do not touch the curtains!"" They must remain quiet during the day until the war is over. Pieter brought along his cat. Life continues in hiding. Anne begins her diary. We see their life, confined to a small space. Personality conflicts? Is Anne alright? They hear the sounds of bombs. Tempers get frayed from their confinement. One night they hear noises near their secret door! It was a burglar. Can they take in one more?

They are short on rations. The new man tells what is happening outside. What if he is allergic to cats? Coughing and sneezing! Anne dreams of prisoners, and screams. A man outside hears this [he is out after the curfew]. Why do grown-ups consider themselves experts on raising children? Bombs fall near their house. Their skylight is broken. Pieter plays a trick about his cat [conditional reflex]. Someone breaks into the office downstairs. A noise frightens him away, he leaves the door open. Passing military police investigate the rooms. Will the cat make a noise? Does this place them in danger? Personal conflicts continue over dividing the food. It is very difficult to get cigarettes. One employee wants more money. People's nerves are frayed. The broke skylight can't be repaired. One man is caught stealing food. Will he be rejected and put out on the street? ""You can't be nice to some people."" Their radio tells of the invasion in Normandy, its good news! They celebrate and sing. There is tension from a ringing telephone. Should they have left earlier?

They reminisce about the past (two years in hiding). Anne and Pieter talk about the past. One day they hear sirens and banging on the door downstairs. ""Auf machen!"" There is noise from a search downstairs. They are told to leave immediately! Later Otto is told that unknown thief told the police. Otto tells about his experiences. He reads Anne's diary. ""In spite of everything, I really believe people are good at heart."" [Don't let your imagination overrule the known facts.]

The crime news should tell you how realistic that sentence is. That is why we have locks on doors and other controls regarding property. ""Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."" Or, ""it takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun"". Yes, there are some places where people don't lock their doors. But its not in a big city where there are a lot of strangers.

623897,5,6303317340,"The true story of Anne Frank and her family is brilliant, if not heartbreaking.

Anne's diary takes the reader through her life in Amsterdam through the eyes of a teen girl.  Every entry is powerful, interesting, and adds to the story.

This 1959 film has earned its own special piece of history.  To be perfectly honest, it feels different than the diary.  There are some significant differences while retaining the concept of an everyday family, forced to hide for over two years, an incredible girl in the middle of it all, and the realization of the horror that followed.

Truly, I recommend the diary more than the film for someone new to Anne's story.  However, the film is still one of my favorites in movie history.  The diary is just one of those once in a lifetime unbelievable treasures of recorded history.  This film is an additional element and special on its own. Indeed, the film now being more than fifty years old itself is a historic story itself.

One benefit that this film did have was that it was produced only about thirteen years after the end of the war.  Otto Frank, Anne's father, actually visited the set of the film and the director, George Stevens, visited Otto Frank in Amsterdam.  This gives a significance to the film.  The storytellers involved had a connection to the real story even if the film has some differences.  The actors who played Anne and Margot met with Otto Frank too.  While Mr. Frank assisted in these ways, he chose to never watch the play or film.

One of the most striking differences in the movie is the role of the dentist.  Anne often had disputes with the dentist in her diary.  However, he was not made to be a complete fool in the diary, they simply didn't get along and shared a room.  In the film, the dentist becomes a comedic role and a character who knew little of his religion.  The real dentist was perhaps the most devoted to his religion in the diary.  Nevertheless, this comedic role actually works exceedingly well in the film.  It may not follow reality, but it's a strong point of the film making.

There are some other differences.  Meip, for example, after the family's capture, kept Anne's diary in her desk waiting for her return.  In the film, it is kept in the attic.  Peter's family didn't arrive on the same day to the annex as depicted, but a few days later.

There were many more helpers in reality than depicted in the film.

The cat did not go missing permanently in reality, but does in the film.

The bread scene where Peter's father is caught steeling bread didn't specifically happen either.  Meip specifically pointed this out, the bread scene, in her analysis that no play/film were ever completely accurate.

Therefore, there are many many differences.  However, as a whole, it carries much of the spirit of the diary.  Furthermore, one must remember it is a 1959 film.  Nevertheless, the scenes outside the ""windows,"" of the Annex were filmed on location in Amsterdam by George Steven's son, so those scenes are very authentic indeed.

The Blu-Ray is what I really wanted to rave about here!  This blu-ray is an exceptional production.  The film is of course included in beautiful quality black and white as original in full length.  However, there are so many bonuses.  Commentary by Stevens' son and Millie Perkins (the actor who played Anne).  This commentary is from a 2004 release, but still a wonderful listen.  There are lots of videos extras too.  Interviews with George Stevens Jr., Millie Perkins, a documentary about the film that is 90 minutes, etc. etc.  There is so much material!

I highly recommend this Blu-Ray.  If there is ever a reason to recommend the possibilities and benefits of blu-ray, this is a great example.  There are so many bonuses you'd never get on a DVD or an online video on demand service.

A 2009 dramatic production of Anne Frank's diary made for television is also available on DVD & Blu-Ray.  While this is a scaled down TV production and much shorter in length, it follows the diary a bit more closely.  I recommend viewing both.

Highly recommended story, film, and blu-ray!",1283904000,5,4110,4.687675070028011

623963,5,6303317340,"""The Diary of Anne Frank"" which was released in 1959 (this being the 50th anniversary edition) tells the story of a group of Dutch Jews in hiding in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation of Holland. They are aided by some Dutch Gentile friends, Miep Gies [Dody Heath] and Mr Kraler [Douglas Spencer]. The group consists of Anne Frank [Millie Perkins], father Otto [Joseph Schildkraut], mother Edith [Gusti Huber], and sister Margot [Diane Baker], as well as the Van Daan's [Van Pels], Mrs Van Daan [Shelly Winters], Mr Van Daan[Lou Jacobi], and son Peter [Richard Beymer], and dentist Mr Dussel [Ed Wynn].

Anne keeps a diary, in which she records her feelings, longings, and experiences during this period in hiding and the movie is basically a reenactment of the events that she recorded in her diary [which was left behind when the group were arrested, kept by Miep and returned to Anne's father upon his return after the war].

What I liked about the movie was the credible depiction of the fears and frustrations of people in hiding. It was a very dangerous period for Jews during the Nazi reign in Europe in WW II, and more so for Jews in hiding [as they were effectively committing a 'crime' by Nazi standards, by evading deportation]. Anne and her group are forced to live in close quarters, and for a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, this is intolerable. Peter, Anne and Margot have to suffer the indignity of being constantly scrutinized by the adults, especially Mrs Van Daan, who is quite a domineering busybody and nag [a wonderful performance by Shelly Winters]. Anne and Peter especially suffer because they form an attachment, much to the displeasure of Mrs Van Daan.

The movie effectively captures the somber atmosphere of the time, and the sound effects add to bleak atmosphere. The fear of exposure and discovery is constantly portrayed throughout the movie, and the audience senses this all the time. I can only imagine how the actual people must have felt, having to live in constant fear like that, knowing that discovery could only mean imprisonment and even death.

However, there are problems with this movie - it is not an altogether historically accurate representation of actual events. The Franks had gone into hiding before the Van Daans, but this is portrayed otherwise in the movie. Peter Van Daan [Van Pels] was extremely shy in real life, but his demeanor is portrayed differently here, and his romance with Anne is overly exaggerated in typical Hollywood style.

I felt that another production, ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"" [2001] was a more realistic and faithful adaptation of Anne's story, and it had the added benefit of covering Anne's life before she went into hiding, as well as a reenactment of what happened to the group after they were captured,their internment in the concentration camps, the deaths of the various group members, culminating in the return of Anne's father, Otto to Amsterdam after the war.

I would still recommend this movie for its production values and as another version of Anne's story [this version ends with the group's capture], but I would highly recommend ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"" for a more in-depth coverage of Anne's life and death. The new BBC production (2008) is also very good.

This DVD comes with extras that make this a worthwhile purchase, the most notable being:
A featurette ""George Stevens in WW II""
""The Making of The Diary of Anne Frank: A Son's Memories"" with George Stevens Jr.
Interviews with Millie Perkins (who played Anne Frank) and Diane Baker (Margot)
""Shelley Winters and The Diary of Anne Frank""
""The Sound and Music of The Diary of Anne Frank""
A narration by George Stevens Jr. of correspondence between his father and Otto Frank, and many more.

623966,5,6303317340,"What more can I say about this beloved film?  It's still the most literal, well-known adaptation of Anne Frank's story, directly based on the Broadway play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett.  Director George Stevens felt a great personal need to tell this story, as his film unit, as part of the US Army Signal Corps, was the first to go into the Dachau concentration camp after it's liberation in 1945, documenting the atrocities committed there by the Nazis (much of what Stevens shot was later used as evidence during the Nuremberg trials).  It was an experience which stayed with him, shaped the dark themes in later films like ""Shane"" and ""A Place in the Sun""; and THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK was, no doubt, the culmination of an obsession to reconcile himself with those traumatic wartime memories.

A lush production, THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (1959) featured an amazing multi-storey set, closely modeled by art designers George W. Davis and Lyle Wheeler on the original Amsterdam hiding-place.  For the terrifying bombing scenes, parts of the set were built on a platform of springs, causing the building to ""lurch"" and bounce as the bombs fell nearby.  Three actors from the original Broadway cast of the play - Joseph Schildkraut as Otto Frank, Gusti Huber as Edith Frank, and Lou Jacobi as Mr Van Daan - were recruited to reprise their roles for the movie, and they each deliver a realism which heightens the drama immensely.  Shelley Winters openly campaigned for the role of shrill Mrs Van Daan (a magnificent performance which netted the actress an Academy Award that she duly donated to the Anne Frank Museum); and Fox contract players Diane Baker and Richard Beymer played Margot and Peter.  Beloved comedian Ed Wynn stunned audiences with his layered, Oscar-nominated performance as Mr Dussel.  In fantastic supporting roles as the family's devoted helpers Miep and Mr Kraler are Dodie Heath and Douglas Spencer--two highly talented, versatile actors who very rarely receive their full dues when this movie is discussed--and I made certain to include them here because of that sad fact.

For the plum role of Anne Frank, director Stevens launched an exhaustive, worldwide talent search.  Broadway's Susan Strasberg wasn't overly interested in reprising her performance; Audrey Hepburn was approached, being a close friend of Otto Frank and later a patron of the Anne Frank Trust, but having lived through the terrible occupation of Brussels during the war, she feared it would require opening very painful old wounds.  For a while it looked like a young Dutch actress named Marianne Sarstadt would play Anne; and people became rather alarmed when Stevens began considering German actress Sabine Sinjen for the role.  Millie Perkins, a nineteen-year-old model from New Jersey with absolutely no acting experience, finally landed the part and ended up giving a very tender and appropriate performance, thanks in no small part to George Stevens' intense direction and the support of her co-stars.  It started the young girl on a very successful acting career in movies and television, but Perkins was quoted as saying recently: ""I was a star only once, and that was when I did The Diary of Anne Frank.""

This 50th Anniversary edition of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (ironically released close to the date of what would have been Anne's 80th birthday) boasts a wealth of all-new bonus material:

*""George Stevens in WWII"" featurette (comprising many pieces of colour footage from George Stevens' Signal Corps coverage)
*""The Making of The Diary of Anne Frank: A Son's Memories"" featurette with George Stevens Jr.
*""Memories from Millie Perkins and Diane Baker"" featurette (recent interviews with Perkins and Baker sharing their stories from the set)
*""Shelley Winters and The Diary of Anne Frank"" featurette (using 1983 interview portions from ""George Stevens: A Filmmakers' Journey"")
*""The Sound and Music of The Diary of Anne Frank"" featurette (focusing on Alfred Newman's stirring, Oscar-nominated musical score)
*""The Diary of Anne Frank Correspondance"" featurette (George Stevens Jr. narrates letters from his father and Otto Frank written during production of the film)
*Fox Legacy with Tom Rothman (from the Fox Movie Channel)
*extensive photo galleries
*interactive pressbook gallery
in addition to an audio commentary with Millie Perkins and George Stevens Jr. (ported over from the previous Studio Classics edition).

Sadly missing from this edition is the fascinating, 90-minute Fox special ""Echoes from the Past: The Diary of Anne Frank"", which was the main bonus feature for the film's 2004 Studio Classics release (in addition, the Fox Movietone newsreels, press conference footage, and an excerpt from ""George Stevens: A Filmmakers' Journey"" are dropped as well).  I'd advise people to hold onto the old disc and also double-dip for the 50th Anniversary one, because both offer some essential extras for the fans.

Now, perhaps more than ever before, we need this wonderful, heartbreaking and life-affirming film.  Recommended.",1247011200,14,5049,5.209876543209877

The story ends as her family is found and taken to the prison camps, so you don't see that part of history.  The end is a ""verbal review"" of what happened during that time by Mr. Frank as he discovers her ""diary"" back in the loft where the families existed for 3 years before being found by Nazis.

I found Ben Kingsley's version in the remake of the late 90's to be much more real, but I'm glad I watched this version too.",1234310400,,373,4.420289855072464
624031,3,6303317340,"""The Diary of Anne Frank"" which was released in 1959 tells the story of a group of Dutch Jews in hiding in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation of Holland. They are aided by some Dutch Gentile friends, Miep Gies [Dody Heath] and Mr Kraler [Douglas Spencer]. The group consists of Anne Frank [Millie Perkins], father Otto [Joseph Schildkraut], mother Edith [Gusti Huber], and sister Margot [Diane Baker], as well as the Van Daan's [Van Pels], Mrs Van Daan [Shelly Winters], Mr Van Daan[Lou Jacobi], and son Peter [Richard Beymer], and dentist Mr Dussel  [Ed Wynn].

Anne keeps a diary, in which she records her feelings, longings, and experiences during this period in hiding and the movie is basically a reenactment of the events that she recorded in her diary [which was left behind when the group were arrested, kept by Miep and returned to Anne's father upon his return after the war].

What I liked about the movie was the credible depiction of the fears and frustrations of people in hiding. It was a very dangerous period for Jews during the Nazi reign in Europe in WW II, and more so for Jews in hiding [as they were effectively committing a 'crime' by Nazi standards, by evading deportation]. Anne and her group are forced to live in close quarters, and for a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, this is intolerable. Peter, Anne and Margot have to suffer the indignity of being constantly scrutinized by the adults, especially Mrs Van Daan, who is quite a domineering busybody and nag [a wonderful performance by Shelly Winters]. Anne and Peter especially suffer because they form an attachment, much to the displeasure of Mrs Van Daan.

It was apt that the movie was filmed in B&W as it effectively captures the somber atmosphere of the time, and the sound effects add to the menace and fear of the group. The fear of exposure and discovery is constantly portrayed throughout the movie, and the audience senses this all the time. I can only imagine how the actual people must have felt, having to live in constant fear like that, knowing that discovery could only mean imprisonment and even death.

However, there are problems with this movie - it is not an altogether historically accurate representation of actual events. The Franks had gone into hiding before the Van Daans, but this is portrayed otherwise in the movie. Peter Van Daan [Van Pels] was extremely shy in real life, but his demeanor is portrayed differently here, and his romance with Anne is overly exaggerated in typical Hollywood style.

I felt that another production, ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"" [2001] was a more realistic and faithful adaptation of Anne's story, and it had the added benefit of covering Anne's life before she went into hiding, as well as a reenactment of what happened to the group after they were captured,their internment in the concentration camps, the deaths of the various group members, culminating in the return of Anne's father, Otto to Amsterdam after the war.

I would still recommend this movie for its production values and as another version of Anne's story [this version ends with the group's capture], but I would highly recommend ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"" for a more in-depth coverage of Anne's life and death.",1232496000,11,3233,4.8354430379746836

He recognizes a scarf knitted by Anne, picks it up and cried deeply upon it.the scarf seems to represent all that is now lost.

  Millicent Perkins ***** is enchanting in the role of Anne Frank, her glossy eyes and energetic playfulness which keeps her deluded from the tragic fate of the eight. She's full of soul and depth.

Shildkraut is also realistic in his portrayal of a very compassionate father trying to keep the children's spirits up and insuring that the children continue with their studies,providing them with as normal a life as possible under the very oppressed ,disturbing circumstances.

Shelly Winters,well she was well awarded for her  convincing role.

All in all it is a very great, though extremely disturbing and saddening film.

Watching this touching movie spreads into your heart, and makes the eyes flood up with pity and sorrow.

This movie Should be seen At Least Once. It is easy to forget that we should count our blessings and be reminded of human torture the Holocaust brought. This film has a humbling effect.

The ending can easily move one to be more appreciative of his family and how little time we have on earth to love. As they stand , the eight of them terrorized, and yet somehow seem accepting and still hold dignity despite the doom they face.

This brilliant movie, however, is based on a true story---and we know the tragic ending before it even begins.  These wonderful human beings are doomed.  Among them are three teenagers, including Anne Frank, who will never become full grown adults.  Only the father will survive the death camps.  Their sole ""crime"" was the fact that they were Jews.  They were perceived as polluters of the gene pool.  The only good Jew was supposedly a dead one.  Eradicating them was deemed a nonnegotiable obligation.  Even winning the war might have been a secondary priority for Hitler's followers.

This is definitely not escapist entertainment.  Nonetheless, please make sure the young people in your life view this film at least once in their life.  They need to know that such evil exists.  Ignoring it only increases the likelihood of more victims of totalitarian madness in the future.

Why? This is a movie about a 13 year old girl and her family that hides with her family and 4 other people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to escape from the Nazis during World War 2 because they are Jewish.

624154,5,6303317340,"Restored to its original 180 minute roadshow length (including overture and exit music), George Stevens' CinemaScope production of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (1959, Fox) is a deeply moving and superbly acted movie experience.  Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett adapted their Broadway show, with a brilliant Joseph Schildkraut  (Otto Frank) and Gusti Huber (Mrs. Frank) repeating their stage roles.  Added to a great cast are a very poignant and natural young Millie Perkins as Anne, Oscar winner Shelley Winters, Oscar nominee Ed Wynn in a bitter dramatic role, Diane Baker, and Richard Beymer as Anne's boy friend.

It is heartrending material--a German Jewish family hiding out from the Nazis for two years in a Dutch attic, with Anne keeping a daily diary that was curiously ignored by the Nazis and has become one of the most important Holocaust documents.  (Maybe the same God who unforgivably let Anne and her sister die in a concentration camp only one month before war's end helped hide her diary for posterity.)  Location filming was done in the actual Amsterdam attic, with the real Otto Frank as technical advisor.  The Oscar-winning B&W art direction re-creates the actual two story attic interior to perfection (on huge Fox sound stages), and Oscar-winning cinematographer William Mellor (PEYTON PLACE) worked miracles to make wide CinemaScope compositions look cramped and claustrophobic. Producer/director Stevens gives it all a nail-biting tension, even though we know the grim outcome because of the powerful opening and closing framing device.

Bonus material is outstanding--a feature-length documentary ""Echoes From the Past."" new interviews with George Stevens, Jr. (who was second-unit director in Amsterdam) and a still-beautiful 66 year old Millie Perkins, and Movietone Newsreel footage.  You will need two evenings for this film masterpiece that was nominated for eight Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, BEN-HUR, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER.

She was wonderful, expressing the gamut of teenage emotions and evoking from me a caring, understanding response. Her only weakness is in her voice-over narration--it's a bit stiff, never transcending the sense of someone reading rather than just talking naturally.

Millie Perkins played the title role of Anne Frank, a girl in her teens who wished for a happy life and did her best to bring happiness to her family during a tumultuous time in the course of history.

In the two years the eight people were cooped up in a secret hideout on the top floor of a building located in the heart of Amsterdam, Anne kept up with her education and had the dream of one day to become a writer. She began writing a diary of her daily experiences of what she learned in life and how she coped with the boredom while in hiding. She had a courtship with Peter Van Daan as their relationship grew stronger toward the end when the SS broke through the secret entrance arresting all eight people.

Anne died of typhus within two months of Nazi Germany's surrender while interned at the infamous Bergen-Belzen death camp. Her father, Otto, was the only one of the eight to survive the Holocaust, returning to the former hideout where he found his daughter's diary to have it published. He resided in Canada until his death in the 1980s.

I visited the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam during the summer of 1977 before seeing this film for the first time the following year. Seeing the layout of the actual hiding place, I could picture how everything was while watching the film. Though a part of history, reflecting back to that dark era is painful for some people who had experienced the Holocaust and Nazi persecutions.

Although I greatly admire George Stevens for having the courage to address such a difficult and sensitive subject in the mainstream, the movie he created is maddeningly inconsistent in quality. It seems to lack the certain spark, sincerity, and flow of the director's best work, and come to think of it, the brilliant play on which it is based. The movie is hurt severely by Millie Perkins, who is whiney and lifeless in the crucial title role. Of all the worthy talent out there (including Susan Strasberg, who originated the role on Broadway), why did they have to pick someone who was not only inadequate, but 10 years to old for the part. Additionally, Richard Beymer is so comatose as her love interest Peter Van Daan that he might as well be constructed of driftwood, and the whole drama is dragged on for such a long period of time that the ending is almost anticlimatic. On the positive side, Joseph Schildkraut and Lou Jacobi recreate the roles they held on Broadway with conviction and gusto, and Shelly Winters won an Oscar for her delightful performance as Mrs. Van Daan. The screanplay by Albert Hacket and Francis Goodrich is also frequently moving. Not a bad showing, but hardly the classic it could have potentially been.",1093737600,2,1358,4.782978723404256

624212,5,6303317340,"Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel once wrote that dramatizing the Holocaust was a futile task, not because dramatization could not be done, but because any such attempt would trivialize the evil inherent in the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Wiesel had good reason for his belief, having directly experienced what circumstances were like at the Auschwitz death camp.
In one sense I agree with Wiesel; however, I also agree with those, such as director George Stevens, who believed that dramatization served the critical purpose of informing the public of what occurred during the Nazi era. Further, as Otto Frank maintained, it was important that audiences realized that what his family and other Jewish people endured was not something restricted to Jews, but was, rather, an object lesson for the persecution of all people forced to endure the tyranny of genocidal regimes.
In a sense, therefore, its inevitable that Stevens filming of The Diary of Anne Frank both failed and succeeded. It failed in that it commercialized the Holocaust, as every dramatic production is forced to do. But it succeeded in its educational mission, especially considering that at the time of its release in 1959, few people were aware of Anne Franks diary, or of the Holocaust generally.
Seeing the film today, it is still a powerful experience. Admittedly, as an aspect of its commercial treatment, certain elements were introduced that either were not in the original diary ---- such as the stealing of bread by Albert Dussell (pseudonym of Friedrich Pfeffer) ---- or were exaggerated for dramatic reasons (the love interest between Anne and Peter Van Dann). But the overall power of the basic situation ---- the intense atmosphere of tension and claustrophobia ---- and the story of Anne Franks adolescent transformation and her growing awareness of the transformation of Dutch society through Nazi oppression ---- gives us a window on the Holocaust which is unique. The film, like the diary, holds up a mirror of conscience in what must have seemed at the time to be a world of sprawling insanity. Anne Frank triumphs, as the Nazis emphatically did not, in transcending the contradictions within herself, and as a consequence her idealism shines through at the end (even if this, too, was exaggerated for cinematic reasons).
Millie Perkins, who plays Anne in the film, has sometimes been slighted for her ostensibly awkward performance, but I believe this is a cynical and unjust criticism. For one thing, Perkins was not a trained actress, but rather a model who happened to have the right look and personality for the part. But as both the documentary and one of the other supplements on this DVD point out, this was precisely why George Stevens chose her for the role. He wanted an unknown actress, not a professional who would impose her persona on the character. He believed ---- and I think correctly ----- that her look of innocence, and aura of adolescent idealism, were perfect for what he desired, and its ultimately these qualities which impress us by their contrast with the horrific circumstances that surrounded her.
The other cast members are also superb. Though Shelley Winters won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress, virtually all the actors, especially Joseph Schildkraut and Ed Wynn, are equally brilliant. In fact, Schildkraut not only physically resembled Otto Frank, but, according to Anne Franks cousin (interviewed as part of the accompanying documentary, Echoes of the Past), was also similar to him in terms of personality and demeanor. Wynn, for his part, turns in an amazingly convincing performance in a serious role, playing completely against type.
Whatever the liberties taken by the screenplay writers for Diary, the film remains faithful to the core experiences related in Anne Franks journal ---- both to her inner emotions and conflicts with her family, and to her widening awareness of her familys place in the overall scheme of Nazi terror. The fact that this DVD transfers the film in such superior video and audio quality, and adds several excellent supplements (including a first-rate 90-minute documentary), makes this disc a fine addition to anyones video collection.",1079395200,86,4193,5.1405563689604685

624264,4,6303317340,"""The Diary of Anne Frank"" was given the big-budget treatment in the late 50s and brought to the screen by George Stevens, who had directed such classics as ""Giant"" and ""A Place In The Sun."" Stevens wanted to emphasize the cramped quarters of the tiny attic where Anne and seven of her family members and friends hid for two years from the Nazis. The studio insisted that the film be made in Cinemscope, the new widescreen process and despite this setback, Stevens did manage to convey a sense of claustrophobia by utilizing clever set design and camera angles. The film won an Oscar for set design.
A nationwide search for an unknown actress to portray Anne Frank resulted in the casting of a young model named Millie Perkins. While some critics felt that Perkins was too old to play the 13 year old Anne, I think she does a good job here and doesn't really look too old for the part at all. Her voice is a tad shrill in the voice-over monologues but otherwise she is fine. Shelley Winters won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work as Mrs. Van Daan and Joseph Schildkraut is also memorable as Otto Frank, Anne's father.
The only major fault with the film is its length - at 170 minutes, it is sometimes slow moving. The best sequences are the ones in which the safety of the families are threatened. These sequences are extremely well done and will have you on the edge of your seat in suspense.
Fox has done a good job with the care and resoration of this film for dvd. The picture is presented in its original widescreen format and is sharp and detailed with good contrasts between black and white. Alfred Newman's complete 7 minute overture to the film is also included here.
The supplements on side two of the dvd are fantastic. A 90 minute documentary features interviews with Shelley Winters, Millie Perkins, George Stevens Jr., as well as Holocaust historians and family and friends of the Frank family. This documentary is excellent, in some ways as interesting as the film itself, and answers many questions that you may have after seeing the film. The documentary also shows how parts of the films were sanitized for the 50s audiences. Other features includes Academy Awards footage, film premiere footage, stills gallery, Millie Perkins screen test and a feature on the career of director George Stevens.",1076976000,5,2328,4.69437652811736
624265,4,6303317340,"""The Diary of Anne Frank"" is based on the tragic best selling diary of a young girl's real life account of her secret existence under Nazi persecution. After the war breaks out, Anne's prudent father, Otto (Joseph Schildkraut) whisks the family underground to avoid being sent to a concentration camp. Together with another family, the Franks attempt to wait out the prospect of being discovered in a cramped attic adjacent a factory run by the resistance. Anne (Millie Perkins) endures the hardship, danger and sadness of World War II, but never without hope and astonishment for a better tomorrow. Petronella (Shelly Winters) and Hans van Daan (Lou Jacobi) are also in hiding with the Franks and their son, Peter (Richard Beymer). But the bond of loyalty that develops between Peter and Anne is threatened by Hans' greed and distemper.

Despite being forced by Fox to shoot his film in the widescreen process of Cinemascope, director George Stevens nevertheless managed to capture the claustrophobic atmosphere of a regime slowly closing in on the Frank's precarious abode. Stevens, a member of the first American film corps that liberated several Nazi concentration camps with the allies, was appalled by the overwhelming scope of genocide he encountered. His outrage is channeled on this occasion into a poignant, visceral and emotionally stirring production that not only manages to capture the essence of the period, but rightfully preserves the memory of Anne Frank; a young girl, aged well beyond her years, who had the clairvoyance to put onto paper one of the most heartbreaking and genuine accounts of the second world war.

Fox gives us a stunning B&W anamorphic picture with zero film grain, solid blacks, fine detail and remarkable clarity. Really, there's nothing to complain about in this visual presentation. The audio is equally impressive. The musical score is spread across all five channels and offers a genuinely moving experience.
The extras include a 90 minute documentary on the real Anne Frank, the film and WWII, some period featurettes and the original theatrical trailer.",1075766400,5,2100,5.191740412979351

Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned the latter even though both are about Nazi German, both in B/W. But that was as far as their similarities go.
The whole film was taped within a small house, as such it was more like a play than a movie and it was in B/W.  As a play, there wasn't any illuminating dialogue and those under depiction were poignant at times but sporadic. So was the rhythm.  It was rather plain and straightforward without much drama, no plot except the ticking of the clock of history plus a little bit of suspension at most. There wasn't any change of scenes as such nor any costume. It's devoid of music too.
But it was not a documentary either. The actress to say the least was ( at least 10 years) too old for the heroine to convey with any conviction the change from an adolescent into puberty, neither her feelings nor aspirations. It is not real enough to be a good documentary.
To conclude, it's quite boring. Five stars for Schindler's List, six for the Diary ( for both  the edited and unedited version ) but only two for this film.",1049846400,8,1241,4.482300884955753

624272,4,6303317340,"The Dairy of Anne Frank is a movie about a family and their struggle to survive during World War II. During this time the Frank family including the Van Danns', and Dr. Dussle must learn to work together so that they are not caught by the Nazi party, lead by Adolf Hitler. In Amsterdam, Holland the group of people live in a tightly squished annex room in Mr. Franks building. With the help of Meip and Mr. Krawler, both good friends of Mr. Frank, they help them hide.

 The movie was very good and there are many events to support this in my opinion. I love the suspense in his story because it makes you want to keep on watching. The movie also has great sound effects like the footsteps, police sirens, and the gun shooting. The acting was ok. There were some dramatic techniques and events that where mesmerizing and unpredictable.
 A few things I disliked about the movie was when the cat was always a threat to the family and the rest of the group, because he would make noise. I also did not like it when the Gestapo had come into the building and knocked down the bookcase. If only the cat wasn't there they might never have been caught.

We are all one and will always be one as long as we all work together. I honestly believe what Anne said:

624334,5,6303317340,"Anne Frank wanted to be a writer, maybe live in Paris....but life didn't go the way she wanted it to. Instead, her life went in a completely opposite direction. I cannot help feeling that perhaps her life was meant to be the way it was, so generations after her, would remember the war in such a way as to never want such a human tragedy to occur again. This is a version of the Broadway drama dealing with the Holocaust and perhaps that is why it is more upbeat. This movie is more entertaining than horrifying. While there is an undercurrent of fear and suspense throughout the whole movie, there is much left to the imagination.

When Anne and her family are forced into hiding in Amsterdam, she is pensive at first, but soon learns that she can create her own happiness. There are two families living in a small space and they must face the possibility of being discovered at any time. They face hunger and cabin fever. They spend time reading, sewing, listening to the radio and being as quite as they can for most of the time. In the evenings when the workers in the factory below go home, they can then resume family life.

Anne has not been exposed to the evils of life. In 1942 she starts a journey to learn about herself and about the hardships of life. After receiving a diary as a present, she immediately starts to pen all her thoughts which are buried deep in her heart. As they spill out onto the pages, we are invited into Anne Frank's world. The world of a teenage girl, who is just learning about life, yet who learns so much in so little time.

I found this movie to perhaps be the most emotionally engaging story I have ever watched on film. Anne Frank had my heart in the first ten minutes. I was in love with her character, her personality, her big bright eyes, her interesting way of looking at life, her thought process, her eternal optimism and her delightfully impetuous nature. You will simply forget you are watching a black-and-white film. The picture is so colored by the characters that in fact, you will forget you are watching a movie. It is quite amazing how a film could be made on two families living in a few rooms in an attic. For this to be possible and enjoyable, the story had to be so true, and so real, that it would demand your full attention.

While this movie is based in the second World War, it is not at all pensive through the entire movie. I found myself laughing at one line so much, I actually cried. It was a line about the cat and I think you will think it is quite funny, especially if you watch the expression on the face of Ed Wynn as he is saying it. The cat belongs to Peter and becomes a part of the family. Having a cat in this movie was a delightful surprise.

The playful taunting between Anne and Peter is amusing. Anne has no friends to talk to and can't believe she is trapped up in this room with no girlfriends to talk to. She is such a typical teenager, that you completely understand her frustration.

While today we find it hard to comprehend how anyone could have their freedoms taken away from them, It could happen as easily to us as it did to them. Each time we treat someone with disrespect, we add to the evil influences in the world. It all starts in the heart. To me, Anne represented the good in the world, the light shining in the darkness. She had a heart which was so giving and she was open to experiencing life, no matter what her circumstances. Perhaps her soul was the most beautiful one God ever allowed to walk on our earth, and for such a short time. This is a movie you will never forget. Of all the movies I have seen, this one was the most beautiful in spirit.

For example, in the video, Mr. Van Daan smokes a lot.  In the  book, Anne does not talk about him smoking a lot.  In the video, only 2  ""protectors"" spend any time visiting the Secret Annex.  In the  book, there are four.  We listed many differences, but we all agreed - the  feeling, the suffering, and the overall story are the same.  It doesn't  matter if some details are different; the horrifying story remains the  same!  And, as one student said to me after class, ""I not only  suffered with the people, but I decided the problems in my life aren't  important.  We learn what real suffering is.  I also learned what it was  like to be a teenager again!""  Anne's problems growing up are  universal.  The book should be read by people of different ages and  countries. It is a teenager's story in an unbelievable, but real situation!  It is worthwhile reading and viewing for everyone!  We must never forget!",959644800,,1075,4.515789473684211
624400,3,6303317340,"I thought this movie was expectionally wonderful. I especially recommend the movie to people who are interested in the Holocaust or Anne Frank. I loved the movie the first time I saw it, but I also have my musings over  some of the scenes. I thought Millie Perkins as Anne Frank was good, but  she was too old and too refined for the part. I thought Joseph Schuildkraut  as Otto Frank was wonderful, Richard Beymer as Peter van Daan with a real  talent for acting. Ed Wynn as Albert Dussel was great! And Shelley Winters  as Petronella van Daan was amazing. Although I love the movie, I have also  read Anne Frank's diary, and I thought too many parts from the diary was  omitted from the movie. The movie didn't strengthen the stressful points  that Anne penned in her diary. For example, how much Anne really despised  her roomate, Mr. Dussel, wasn't evidently shown in the movie. Also, Anne  mentioned so many dreams and hopes in her diary. I think there's about four  or five scenes in the movie with Anne alone with her diary. Anne Frank's  diary centered around the Secret Annex with her parents, Margot, the van  Daans, and Peter. The movie alone was too general. And also why was not Mr.  Kleiman and Bep Voskujil portrayed in the movie?  But I really like the  movie, and I recommend it, though. I have always been interested in Anne  Frank, and I think the movie intensified it.",958694400,3,1388,4.532258064516129

I apparently missed this somehow, and I now have a ""Blueray only"" that also won't play on my Sony BDp-S3700 Blueray player, won't play on Windows Media or VLC (with downloaded libraries and keys) through a Vanguard external Blueray player, and basically is of no use to me. Perhaps someday I will find a way to play this, but today is not that day :( I gave it two stars because I am responsible for thinking multi-format meant more than just Blueray, but the fact that it won't play on a dedicated Blueray Player is just totally unacceptable.",1516147200,,619,4.585585585585585
