2602790,4,B000G8NXNM,"I'm glad I bought this DVD set. I've shown it to lots of friends and family members (my Da, in particular, enjoyed Mo's miming of a woman's typical morning, while my Mum thought Mo and Kathy's imitation of older students taking a women's studies course was hysterically accurate). My favorite line from Parallel Lives comes from the characters of the little-old-lady Women's Studies students, visiting a museum for a luncheon. One remarks on the appetizing appearance of something she presumes is a display for lunch, and the other, realizing it is an exhibit, says ""No, no, my dear. (pats her hand) That's a [...] on a plate.""
This is a MUST have set for mothers, daughters, Women's Studies enthusiasts, liberals, gays, ex-Catholics, current Catholics, feminists, activists, people who think outside the box, and those that love all of the above.",1168300800,5,847,5.057142857142857
2602791,5,B000G8NXNM,"I've been waiting for years for the landmark HBO special featuring Kathy Najimi and No Gaffney to come out on DVD.  I don't know what took so long, but it was well worth the wait. The sketches range from hilariously funny to movingly poignant, often in the same sketch. This should put to rest the belief that feminists have no sense of humor. ""The Dark Side"" disc, however, was an unnecessary addition. With its amateur video and sound, it simply detracts from the overall quality. A masterpiece like ""Parallel Lives"" needs no additional material.",1167782400,,548,4.829787234042553

2602793,5,B000G8NXNM,"I caught this special on HBO a few times in the last five years and every time I questioned why it wasn't on DVD.  Thank god it finally is!  I teach acting and musical theatre and this DVD is such a great resource--beautifully written, beautifully acted, beautifully staged--these shows are wonderful.  If you're a fan of brilliance, buy this.",1158710400,,343,4.779661016949152
2602794,4,B000G8NXNM,"The comedy team of Kathy and Mo consisted of Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney who first came onto the scene in the early 80s entertaining audiences in their hometown of San Diego, California. They went on to achieve much success in Off Broadway with their two-woman show which consisted mainly of skits featuring hilarious characters with strong views on feminism, gay rights, religion and abortion rights. ""Parallel Lives"" (1991) and ""The Dark Side"" (1995) became HBO specials. Both women went on seperately to achieve success in films and television.

This 2 disc dvd set contains both shows as well as video outtakes from some of their earlier shows. Also featured are two skits that Kathy and Mo did in 2004 when they briefly reunited. I find ""Parallel Lives"" to be much funnier and more satisfying than ""The Dark Side."" The former features the hilarious characters of Madeline Samuels and Sylvia Dunlevy, two elderly women who are broading their horizons by taking women's studies courses as a local junior college (these characters appear again in ""The Dark Side""). And my favorite, the unforgettable Hank (Najimy) and Karen Sue (Gaffney), a drunk with a cigarette constantly dangling from his mouth and a young woman in a western bar, absolutely hysterical! The dvd features a commentary by Najimy and Gaffney.",1158537600,14,1312,5.046082949308755
2602795,5,B000G8NXNM,"I saw this comedy special on HBO back in the early 1990's and was blown away by these two ladies' talent and comedy timing. They are brilliant, and I wish they had done more shows together.  I strongly recommend this to anyone, Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney were sensational together in this show.

2602800,5,B000G8NXNM,"I recorded this show many years ago on a VCR. I showed it to every female friend I have. I laughed my ass off each time, so did they. When I saw it was available on DVD, I dove in and ordered it. Just Do it! Take the plunge! It's worth every penny and then some!! I tip my hat to both Kathy and Mo!",1401580800,,298,3.6
2602801,5,B000G8NXNM,"I had seen Parallel Lives on cable years ago, and loved it. I actually videotaped it back then and made all my friends watch it too!  When I accidentally stumbled upon it here - I had to buy it. Both women are talented comedians in their own right - but the chemistry and timing that they have together is impeccable and flawless.
  It's a series of skits, mainly geared around a female's perspective and issues. Their characters run a wide gamut of ages and demographics that range from the average working class woman, lesbian feminists, teenagers, and elderly friends, to name a few.
There is also religious humor, gay humor, and talk of feminine hygiene products. But there is nothing vulgar or offensive.
They manage to be absolutely hilarious, while making some very powerful social statements as well.

My 5 star rating is for Parallel Lives. I have only watched The Dark Side once - it is OK. I would give that one a 3 at the most.
And the bonus material is, well, bonus material. There is some old footage and the quality is not so great. But hey - it was thrown in for free.
My favorites are the opening with the angels discussing childbirth, and the bar scene as many others have mentioned. Priceless!",1398556800,,1212,4.571428571428571
2602802,5,B000G8NXNM,Kathy and Mo at their very best. Too bad they aren't a team anymore. LOVE this DVD collection. These women are soooo funny!,1397347200,,123,4.391304347826087
2602803,5,B000G8NXNM,"This has two HBO specials, Parallel Lives and The Dark Side.  I have watched Parallel Lives many, many times, and love it every time.  Lines from it have become part of my vocabulary (""you look very, very pretty tonight,"" with cigarette hanging from lip), and I get a good laugh every time.  Many good laughs.  Used to show it to Women's Studies student the last day of the intro class.  Even though it's many years before their time (1991, they weren't born), it beautifully satirizes the second wave of feminism (without undermining it) along with male-female relations (the cowboy hitting on the woman at the bar, saying ""you look very, very pretty tonight . . . When you going to leave your boss man and marry me?""), the young couple at the ""gay Denny's.""  Not to be missed.

The Dark Side, not so much. But the price is right!",1385596800,,831,4.5369127516778525

2602805,5,B000G8NXNM,"When this show was Off-Broadway it caused quite a sensation!  Sell out after sell out crowd watched two virtually unknown pros have at it on any number of topics...all of them current and all of them universal in appeal.  I had tickets for ""Parallel Lives"" but had to opt out at the last possible second because of illness.  It was the first and last time I ever gave a ticket away for anything!!!  I did, however, catch the HBO special when it aired and I must say I have never seen anything or anyone funnier than these two artists.  With nano-second timing they compliment each other like Siamese twins might...where one begins and leaves off the other hops on the ride with a seamlessness usually reserved only for those who have been co-joined at birth or married for 75 years!  Their facial expressions are such that you can read what they are thinking and feeling at any given moment and that is NOT a talent that comes easily to most.  You will be awestruck by their genius as performers as well as their talent for writing...it is flawless.  ""The Dark Side"" is not a second
""Parallel Lives"" but it does well as the footnote, the addendum to a one of a kind show.",1369785600,,1171,4.464788732394366

I forgot about it for some time, but recently my warm memories of it resurfaced and I checked with Amazon.  There it was!  I viewed it again as soon as it arrived (everything seems to get to me quickly from Amazon!), and found it just as hilarious, insightful, delightful, and sad, as the first time I saw it.  If you believe in women and the power of women, or just like belly laughs, this is the DVD for you!  Long live Kathy and Mo!",1366675200,,559,4.036363636363636

2602810,1,B000G8NXNM,"I was very excited to find the Kathy & Mo Show DVD and equally disappointed at its quality.  The beginning was terrible - both audio and visual. The quality improved through the video, but first impressions are important. This product was not represented as poor quality.",1322438400,,271,4.891304347826087
2602811,2,B000G8NXNM,"I thought it would just be the Kathy& Moe show as shown on HBO.It had a lot of really ametur stuff done in small places with bad sound.

2602813,5,B000G8NXNM,"I've been waiting years for this to come out on DVD. When I saw it was here, I almost passed out. The Dark Side is good, but Parallel Lives is the funniest, bust-a-gut laughing thing these two did! My throat was sore the next day from laughing so hard over the Sister Sister Womyn skit. This was well worth the wait.",1271721600,,316,4.19672131147541
2602814,5,B000G8NXNM,"Finally out on DVD and am I thrilled.  I watched this show over and over after recording it from HBO onto a VHS.  I have practically every line memorized.  This show is as potent now as it was when it was created years ago.  I think that says a lot--comedy doesn't always stand the test of time.  But from the opening to the ending this is awesome.

Every skit has a lesson or political point.  I can't say enough about how good the writing is, how funny it is, how sobering it is, how thought-provoking, etc.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.

Parallel Lives is about 1000% better than the dark side, in my opinion.  I don't know if I will ever watch the dark side again or if I would have even liked Kathy and Mo if I had only watched The Dark Side.  I would encourage you to only watch that AFTER you have watched Parallel lives.  But I would have happily paid the same price for Parallel lives alone.",1242864000,,894,4.16374269005848
2602815,4,B000G8NXNM,"A compilation of their two HBO specials.

Parallel Lives is superior to The Dark Side, although even the latter has some great moments. But all the pieces in Parallel Lives are brilliant. The Mattie and Syvie section is brilliant, especially Mattie's monologue about her nephew Michael. Mo Gaffney, the least well-known of the duo, performs a comically delightful and technically astonishing pantomime to classical music in Parallel Lives that you don't want to miss. Definitely worth the $14.98 I paid for it. The bonus disc has amateur footage of other performances in other venues. While the quality is abysmal in most cases, it could be of interest to those curious about the creative process involved in developing a two-person self-scripted show like this.",1227916800,,762,5.195121951219512
2602816,5,B000G8NXNM,"This order contains 2 DVDs. One is historical, and the quality is NOT good...filmed by family members and friends of the entertainers, and hard to watch for its poor sound quality, etc. BUT...the other DVD is the funniest thing you will ever see. Seriously. I've watched these two women do their Parallel Lives routine probably 20 times in the past 10 years, and I still laugh till I cry. Their humor is poignant, too, and brings tears to my eyes still. This is truly, honestly, the very BEST purchase you can make if you want your heart to be touched and your laughter to come all the way from your toes. Thank you, Kathy and Mo, for the gift of your humor.",1223856000,,658,4.401639344262295
2602817,4,B000G8NXNM,"then you will like this video.  Parallel Lives was done many many years ago.  It is a series of skits all unrelated except one which has a part 2 later in the show.  All of Kathy's characters are hysterical, she has a way of making her character come alive and be funny.

The second DVD is The Dark Side and I honestly didn't watch too much of it be cause the picture quality is rough.  It is from their early years and is filled by family and friends on whatever recording equipment they had at the time.

But overall, it brought back great memories to see this on DVD because it had been at least 16 years since I had saw it.",1216512000,,627,4.098360655737705
2602818,4,B000G8NXNM,"Even though you can sometimes catch highlights of this DVD on HBO, the complete set gives you such insight into their comic genius. I watch it over and over, and laugh my [...] off!",1215475200,,181,4.352941176470588
2602819,5,B000G8NXNM,This DVD is a classic - guaranteed to make you laugh.  The extra material shows the beginnings of Kathy & Mo's comedic material and characters. This isn't as funny but is interesting because you see how far Kathy & Mo have come with their acts and turned into the comedic professionals they now are.  The main show begins with Kathy & Mo as angels and progresses from there.  This show is probably one of the funniest I have ever seen.  I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it.  Hooray for Kathy & Mo - excellent.,1181692800,,528,4.24
2602820,4,B000G8NXNM,"I have been in love with Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney ever since their groundbreaking arrival heralded by their HBO special PARALLEL LIVES. Through the years I had heard rumors of a sequel or second part on HBO that I was never able to catch. FINALLY, I have seen it. I can't say that is was worth the wait.

If THE DARK SIDE had been the first one released, it would have been amusing and fun to watch, but not one for the record books. Unfortunately PARALLEL LIVES came out first and blew the doors off, leaving quite large shoes to fill the second time around. The intuitive nature and rapport that exalted any exchange between the two of them during PARALLEL in its entirety does not spark and was not present in THE DARK SIDE.

A Glimmer of the bond between the two was intermittent in the extras and outtakes. With no great production quality demonstrated in this bonus feature the old routines are charming and give us some insight to the Kathy and Mo we now know and adore, but nothing to write home about.

A MUST BUY and well worth the money for PARALLEL LIVES ALONE, the second feature of THE DARK SIDE is not necessarily a plus. My suggestion is watch DARK SIDE first then PARALLEL LIVES for maximum enjoyment.",1171670400,2,1221,4.441964285714286
2602821,5,B000G8NXNM,"This show is hilariously real.  It takes every day events and stereotypes, and puts them into truly amusing situations",1171497600,,118,5.2105263157894735
2602822,4,B000G8NXNM,"The first time I saw The Kathy and Mo Show was in 1992.  I laughed until tears rolled.  From the brilliant opening act of the two angels discussing how human beings should be created, to the genious of the characters they create, this collection is wonderful.  Maddie and Syvie, Sister Woman Sister, Hank and Karen Sue, and the ingenious Angels ""inventing"" humans...all of these acts were hilarious.  Kathy Najimy is a comedic genious.  The productions filmed by audience members aren't the best quality (Dark Side=3 stars), but, the stage productions filmed professionally (Parallel Lives=5 stars!) are fine.  Buy this and watch it any time you need a big lift!",1170720000,,662,5.027522935779817
2602823,5,B000G8NXNM,I am still excited that this was released on DVD with both shows.  Serious comedy that makes you think.  Wonderful.,1170028800,,115,4.7
2602824,3,B000G8NXNM,"I have admired their work separately.  Kathy N. with her devil-may-care humor and wandering eye and Mo showing up in unexpected places (like Ab Fab).  Together their first show is a riot... the majority of it is.  If you never saw the specials on HBO (I think that's the genesis of the first recording, at least) it is worth the time and effort... some laughs, some touching moments.

The Dark Side is that and bogged down a bit, yet with a few bright moments.  Sketch comedy is not for the faint of heart and- especially in the first show - their timing is remarkable.

The 'bonus' material is hard to follow - basically because they have the quality of transferred home movies - grainy and poor sound quality.  I don't have a stereo TV so I was disappointed when I flipped to their running commentary that I could only hear Kathy speak - Mo was faintly in the background.

I would recommend this for anyone who would like to see Kathy pre 'Sister Act' and Mo before her ill fated talk show and guest spots.  They were a hoot!",1168300800,2,1027,4.391534391534392
