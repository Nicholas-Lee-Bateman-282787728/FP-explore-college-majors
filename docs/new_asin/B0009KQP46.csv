Her posse are real people not fitness models with perfect bodies which can make some people feel intimidated. The music will definitely make you move because it is so upbeat. Althea has a lot of ""attitude"" and a great smile. Althea, keep up the good work.",1158883200,,358,4.774193548387097
8062787,4,B0009KQP46,"She has great enthusiasm & so does her 2 female & 1 male backup dancers who look like people in your neighborhood. The only thing is she never breaks anything down, never slows down, she never stops which is great for people in great shape, only maybe counts once in a while. Her backup show diff intensities which is great, but by the time she calls the move, she's doing it already. She does repeat the same moves & small routines so by the end you will probably have caught up, but I do need a breakdown.
The music instrumental versions of very recent hits to keep you going & energized.
The warmup is only 2 minutes of fast head rolls, hip rolls & curling your back.
The 34 min cardio is mambos, grapevines, box steps, butterflies, fast step touching, jumping jacks, African dance, shuffles, horse riding move, squats, hopping, joggiing, voguing, etc. She has a great style & shows you how to get in touch with your creative side when doing it.
The cool down is 8 min of slow high kicks, squats, slower dancing, lunges, etc.
Lastly is 10 min of floor work of crunches & other ab work, leg stretchs, yoga spinal twists, etc.
This is a great DVD for those in great shape who already know how to dance well & keep up a fast pace.
