7516431,5,B017RR6KGQ,Not your typical Hollywood flick!,1456531200,,33,5.8
7516432,4,B017RR6KGQ,"The film centers around a pair of modern ""Robin Hoods"" who agree to steal original 1848 Texas land grants that were stolen from the rightful owners by Miranda Kilroy (Jessica Lindsey). Miranda wants to level the ranches and build a cultural center where she can sing opera. The Robin Hoods recruit from the local residents to aid in the caper.

This is a Spanish film, that feels like it was made for TV. It is a mild comedy, with characters. Plot and action are secondary and lack real development. It is rated PG-13, although I though PG was more suitable with the lack of sex or nudity and the mild swearing...s@#t. Jackie (Cristina Rodlo) is overly intelligent and has a ranch hand boyfriend (Vadhir Derbez) clearly just for his looks. The characters are enjoyable, the plot is straight forward with less twists than a Steven Seagal film.

If you are looking for an adult action/crime/drama/thriller this is not it. This is a film most families can watch in spite of the dreaded PG-13 rating. I would think once the original documents were found and filed with the court, they wouldn't be needed anymore. Likewise, once the bad guys got a hold of the original documents, I don't understand why  they kept them as opposed to simply destroying them. But hey, I am not a lawyer or a film maker. Enjoy it for what it is.

The film is mostly in Spanish and in part in English. I watched it with the subtitles.",1455926400,3,1408,4.575396825396825

7516459,4,B017RR6KGQ,"Very fun. Oh, I don't care about the plot holes. It was satisfying. And what a wonderful vehicle for both Fernando Colunga (sigh!) and ""Big Ed"" Yaez! They were both great in this. The whole supporting cast was, in fact, great. I especially loved the ""spiritualist""-slash-maid and the pretty-but-dim boyfriend of one of the main characters.

Really, a very fun film. It's got a mixture of Spanish and English (mostly Spanish) so you'll need subtitles unless you're bilingual. Go for it! This is your chance to hear Fernando Colunga speak English! (And his accent is mostly okay.)",1471824000,,578,4.958762886597938
7516460,1,B017RR6KGQ,This movie has spiritism in it though it doesn't say so in the movie review. I stopped watching it immediately.,1471305600,,111,4.6

7516480,2,B017RR6KGQ,Not near as witty or well thought out with solid believable characters as Ladrn que roba a ladrn but not a complete loss.
