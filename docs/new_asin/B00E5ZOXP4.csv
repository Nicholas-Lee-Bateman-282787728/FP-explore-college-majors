5891875,5,B00E5ZOXP4,"Snoopy's Holiday Collection is a 3-in-1 reissue of the remastered editions of I Want A Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown and Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales, and one of the 5 volumes of Happiness is Peanuts, Snow Days, containing the final episode of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show and She's A Good Skate, Charlie Brown. I checked and I Want A Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown never contained the famous 2001 documentary about A Charlie Brown Christmas, by itself OR on this set, rather a new one about the creation of Rerun van Pelt, Lucy and Linus' little brother; and it also contains Happy New Year, Charlie Brown, which appropriately debuted on New Year's Day in 1986; you try and read War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy during any vacation... that's a LONG book, and had an amazing secret behind it that Linus told to Charlie Brown. The preceding hour-long special stars Rerun desperately wanting a dog for Christmas, by any means possible, including asking Snoopy to write a letter to his brother Spike, and trying to buy Snoopy from Charlie Brown (tough luck getting $10 million for him, little buddy!). Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales was the worthy replacement for the aforementioned 2001 documentary, and still is! From 2010 to 2012, the segments starring Sally and Lucy were replaced by the Emmy-winning Prep and Landing short Operation Secret Santa (even with its Emmy status, it'd drive any long-running Peanuts fan honking mad to see Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales edited like that), but since last year, those 2 segments have been reinstated, and thank goodness for that! This 18-minute special was originally a CVS-exclusive Remastered Edition DVD (only the sidecover mentions that), which I've noticed at Sam's Club once in January of 2011, alongside the 2010 ""everywhere"" version. By itself or in this set, Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales is a reissue of the 2009 CVS DVD, right down to its FBI warnings being used and all Peanuts DVD commercials being in it! And last but not least, Snow Days, contains the final threesome of segments for The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show; the first 2 contain stories for Christmas and even Valentine's Day, as the final short is about Snoopy's Story that Peppermint Patty wrote and had great success in an essay contest (even mentioning Snoopy being the Easter Beagle)! Speaking of great success stories, She's A Good Skate, Charlie Brown is a rare special to have grownups speaking plainly & regularly, instead of the famous Trombone-mumbling the specials were already famous for by 1980! And it also contained Woodstock's crowning moment in Peanuts history; whistling ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" to keep Peppermint Patty from being disqualified in her ice skating contest, after Snoopy's cassette player broke (though CDs were invented in 1980, when this special premiered, they wouldn't be made and sold publicly for several years afterward); which allowed her to win with flying colors! Aside from Rerun's documentary, the only other bonus features in this 3-disc set are a lot of commercials (most of them in I Want A Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown). This makes a great companion for Peanuts Deluxe Holiday Collection, be it a DVD set, Blu-ray set, or a 6-disc combo pack! What's more, this set's been marked down to $10 in 2014, so it'll be even easier to add this collection to ""the big 3"" on any format! Be it $10 or $20 or more, you won't be sorry with this set, if you're a fan of the Peanuts specials and TV series! Good grief!",1416873600,6,3485,4.898477157360406
5891876,4,B00E5ZOXP4,"This 3-disc set nicely accompanies the recent Warner Blu-Ray or DVD release of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" presenting you with four additional Peanuts Christmas or winter-themed animated specials. If you have the separate DVDs of ""I Want A Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown,"" ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales,"" and ""Peanuts Snow Days,"" you already own all the content in this set. The one downside is that ""I Want A Dog..."" has dropped a nice bonus feature from its initial DVD release. But over three hours of animated Peanuts content for about $10 will leave few complaining.

DISC 1
""I Want A Dog For Christmas, Charlie Brown""  Rerun wants a dog like Snoopy for Christmas.
""Happy New Year, Charlie Brown""  Charlie Brown is all set to finally meet the Little Red-Haired Girl at the New Year's Eve party.
""Sibling Rivalry: Growing Up Van Pelt""  A featurette focusing on the youngest of the three Van Pelt children: Rerun and his relationships with his siblings Linus and Lucy.

DISC 2
""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales""  A collection of Christmas and winter-themed comic strips and plotlines from the classic strip, now animated.
""Is This Goodbye, Charlie Brown?""  A non-winter themed special, the Van Pelts move away.

DISC 3
Episode 18 of ""The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show""  The first half of this episode adapts several comic strips about Christmas. Some of this content was later reworked into ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.""
""She's A Good Skate, Charlie Brown""  Peppermint Patty enters a skating competition with Snoopy as her manager.

As I said, the one disappointment is that Warner's edition of ""I Want A Dog..."" drops a feature from the original DVD release: a nice making of feature about ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" starring Whoopi Goldberg and featuring some rarely seen early Peanuts animation. This should have been ported over to the ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" Blu-Ray/DVD, but it was left off in favor of a new bonus feature. But if you're just wanting a collection of Peanuts cartoons, there's really no complaint.",1416873600,22,2045,5.056547619047619
