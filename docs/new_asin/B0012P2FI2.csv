It allows the observer to experience firsthand the spontaneous excitement of the audience gathering in the historic cobblestone streets of York, England, to watch a live reenactment of the guild wagons being drawn through the streets and the plays performed before excited crowds of young and old alike. We see closeup views of the performers and all the challenges that go along with trying to put sets and performers on wagons that must move from spot to spot.
