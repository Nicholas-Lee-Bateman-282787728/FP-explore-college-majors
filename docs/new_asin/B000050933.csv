2625917,5,B000050933,"I have heard about this movie (I live in the Netherlands) and it was not available anywhere in Europe. I did not want to wait untill it will be screened on dutch television, so I bought it. I am happy to, it fits my collection of top documentaries. The suspense of the documentary and the amazing story got me a bit in doubt if it is a true documentary or a fictional one. It does not matter. It is even more realistic then the Blair Witch project, with the big difference that this could be and is probably an actual documentary. Anyway, I heard rumours in Amsterdam about the Mole People film and how hard it is to get it. Now i am part of the Mole People society?",987724800,12,666,4.170542635658915
2625918,4,B000050933,"you see them walking around and you've wondered where they go at night or come from.""The Mole People"" the whole story will tell you. Underneth the subways of NY, this is the story of the people down there,like way down there,some for more than 10 years. The scenes are real the location scary and the story compelling. It's a must see ""The Mole People"" there out there",987120000,4,368,4.507462686567164
2625919,5,B000050933,"I used to take the ""A"" train to work and I never really gave much thought to the people living in the deepest, dark places in the NYC subway tunnels until I saw this video. It will open your eyes and make you appriciate what you really have. 'nuff said.",986342400,2,253,4.08
2625920,5,B000050933,"You would never think that it is true, but indeed this film is a documentary therefore it is true!!!What an outstanding film on such an unique subject!!!Any movie that leaves you with questions after it is over, gets five stars from me!! Anytime I am in the city I am always looking for those special places that these people enter. How do they do it??? Life down there is another world and one which Victor has captured perfectly through his camera work and editing!!!! A spectacular Documentary and one which should be watched. I am waiting for the Mole people Part two;You've reached the MOLE ZONE!",985910400,3,601,4.679245283018868
2625921,4,B000050933,"I got to give a credit to makers of ""In search of the Mole People"".  For a minute they did covince me that there is a civilization of the ""mole people"" beneath NYC.  However it's just too crazy - people cannot survive in subway tunnels for decades.  It's a well done fake, not much different than ""Blairwitch Project"", except professionally shot.  I am giving this movie four stars only because it kept me glued to the screen for nearly an hour.  Just don't call it a documentary.",985478400,,480,4.471264367816092
2625922,4,B000050933,"I enjoyed In Search of the Mole People.  The topic was very interesting to me.  The next time I get on a subway, I will think about these people that live in the tunnels under NY.  Great music.",983145600,2,193,4.026315789473684
2625923,5,B000050933,"As soon as you hit the play button on your VCR, you drown in the sea of the emotions of people living under the streets of New York City. The scary but at the same time wondering feeling lasts long after you are done watching the movie. This documentary film leaves you with a deep feeling of curiosity and fear about those who are living a life underground. This movie will definitely not leave you indifferent. I highly recommend it.",978912000,11,435,4.45
2625924,5,B000050933,"HELLO.FROM PREVIOUS REVIEWS PEOPLE THINK THAT ""IN SEARCH OF THE MOLE PEOPLE"" IS A HORROR FILM. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY MY REVIEW ON THE MOLE PEOPLE MOVIE.  HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH AN IDEA, WHERE THE DIRECTOR OF THE MOVIE HOLDS THE FORCES OF EVIL WITH A FLASHLIGHT? WHERE THE SUPPORTING CAST INCLUDES A TRIO OF INTELECTUALS WHO FOUND A SECRET UNDERGROUND CIVILIZATION, AND WHERE THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS CERTIFIED BY THE  MYTHS AND LEGENDS INVOLVING SUBTERRANEAN CIVILIZATIONS.  AFTER WATCHING AND STUDYING THIS DOCUMENTARY FILM, AND THINK ABOUT IT WHEN IT IS OVER, YOU WILL REALIZE THAT IT IS SOMETING MORE THEN JUST A FABLE TOLD. IT IS A TRUTH WITH A SIGNIFICANCE FOR YOU AND FOR ME, AND FOR THE WHOLE CENTURY.  HOMELESS PEOPE DWELLING IN SUBWAY TUNNELS IS A FAMILIAR PICTURE TO MOST NEW YORKERS. HOWEVER THIS ISN'T  A LEGEND OR AN URBAN MYTH. THERE IS AN EXISTANCE OF HUMAN SOCIETY, LIVING HUNDREDTHS OR MAY BE EVEN THOUSANDTHS OF MILES UNDER NEW YORK CITY. IT IS  A DEADLY  AND A HORRIFYING PLACE FOR US, ORDINARY PEOPLE, WHERE WE ARE NOT EXCEPTED.  THE ""MOLE PEOPLE"" MOVIE CARRIES SUFFICIENT TRUTH, AND NOT A SINGLE DULL MOMEMT.",978480000,3,1134,4.663316582914573
2625925,4,B000050933,This movie was really really creepy. It was so creepy that I couldn't sleep for two whole weeks. And when I did finally sleep I had creepy dreams. Do you know why I had creepy dreams? I had them because this movie was so damn creepy! What was the creepiest thing about it? I'll tell you... I found out that there are people living underneath me. Not the neighbors either. Not even the people who sometimes sleep in the laundromat. Way way below them. If you see this movie you will find out about them and you will be creeped out too!.......bon appetit.,977184000,4,553,4.378640776699029
2625926,4,B000050933,This movie totally freaked me out!! I can't believe that there  are people living beneath the city and for so many years! Who knew? I enjoyed watching this film and learning about how these people can survive on next to nothing. I was amazed at how those involved in making the film endured actually being in these tunnels to conduct the interviews and shoot the footage. You have to see this film to believe it!!,976492800,5,413,4.506666666666667

8136175,5,B000050933,"Voices In The Tunnels had always intrigued me since I learned of its production.  Having lived in NYC (Manhattan and Queens), I always wondered about the existence of a secret society under the city.  I commend the bravery of the folks who ventured into the darkness to ferret out whatever they could find.  Very brave (and slightly stupid), but nevertheless entertaining.  I would recommend this film for anyone who has ever been curious about the underground living conditions of New York in a post-911 world.",1346803200,,511,4.976470588235294
8136176,4,B000050933,"In Search of the Mole People (Viktor David, 2000)

The opening titles of In Search of the Mole People, Viktor David's illuminating, unsettling documentary on the homeless who live in New York's subway system, briefly sketch out the story of Jennifer Toth, whose book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mole-People-Life-in-the-Tunnels-Beneath-New-York-City/dp/155652241X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City</a>&nbsp;inspired the filmmakers and, according to the film, forced Toth to flee New York after she received death threats for exposing this secret world to the normals who live above-ground. That may seem confusing at first, especially as Toth, who gets a decent amount of screen time here, never really refers to it herself. If you're paying attention, though, in one of the interviews the filmmakers conduct, one of the mole people makes a passing reference to why: ""there were a lot more of us [before the book was written]."" Can one sociological study destroy an entire way of life?

David and his crew don't answer that question (though it would certainly warrant a follow-up film in, say, 2010), but there's definitely a pall over the events here. Still, they do manage to conduct extensive interviews with three of the remaining mole people, and each, though no doubt greatly edited, gets enough screen time to make it worthwhile. And if the third interview tends to reinforce the stereotype that the homeless-by-choice are all mentally unstable, the first two do their best to smash it. In fact, the woman (one of, she claims, only two who had lived in the tunnels for any length of time at the time the interview was conducted) interviewed in the middle portion of the film lays claim to veteran status and a college degree. Not to say that college graduates and veterans aren't mentally unstable, but nothing about her comes off that way, save a (forgivable, given the sanitary conditions of her surroundings) touch of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

I've used the word ""fascinating"" way too much in this batch of reviews, but once again, it applies. The three interviewees give riveting accounts of living outside the grid, while the crew, almost as an afterthought, are intercut giving their impressions of travelling through the tunnels. (And, as I mentioned before, there are also intercuts of Toth giving her impressions on what she had discovered during her sojourn to the tunnels a decade previous.) Most interestingly, I rarely felt pity for the interviewees. (The last of them, who in non-technical terms was totally round the bend, was the exception, but a qualified exception; there was no indication of whether he was crazy before he moved into the tunnels, or whether a decade and a half spent underground had eaten away at his sanity. He never tells us; I doubt he knows. Certainly no one else would.) While it may not be the case, they certainly give the impression that they have carved their niche out of the world, and are content with it, if perhaps a bit less than they were before the publication of Toth's book.

This is not an easy video to find these days, and to my knowledge, it has never seen a DVD release. But it's worth hunting down. There is a world beneath ours; it is a small world, but it is worth understanding. *** ",1185926400,4,3362,5.127737226277373
8136177,3,B000050933,"Now let me get off on the right foot and say two things. One, I really enjoyed this movie. Two, I have not read the book the movie says to have ""picked up from."" My only complaint, really, is in the price. I've spent a lot of time traveling and reading, and the mix of the two of those things really kind of ruined it for me. Homelessness is nothing shocking to me because I live in a city. It might be shocking for those who live in cookie cutter neighborhoods and refuse to believe the man asking you for change is really there. This movie DOES end a myth, I must say in its credit. What this movie really shows is that homeless people will indeed find shelter anywhere. It doesn't make much mention on where they get their food, though they seem to eat all the same foods as regular homeless people. It goes a lot into their cleanliness, which was interesting. And it shows that even when documentary makers pick slightly disturbing topics, they still manage to find the most fearful of the bunch to take along. Most of the buildup was from one of the film crew talking about how afraid he was. It was fantastic visually, but not much for story or content.",1073001600,6,1159,4.321100917431193
8136178,5,B000050933,"Very interesting. I knew that people lived in the tunnels but to actually see how they live was another thing. The fact that you can really see almost a brief day in the life of a person living underground is something very different. Really good movie, a must have for those who collect documentaries.",1069891200,5,302,4.611111111111111
8136179,3,B000050933,"I was really disappointed by this one as I had really high hopes for it.  Having read The Mole People by Jennifer Toth and The Tunnel by Margaret Morton I was captivated and intrigued.  Working with the homeless in my hometown and hearing and coming to know their stories, I was excited by an actual video portraying the lives of these individuals.
While the viewer easily vibes on the nervousness of the filming/interview crew, in the end it just seemed like a voyeuristic thrill for some fortunate college students and those of us who watch the film.  While I did get the impression that they were compassionate toward their subjects, I was left wondering what good the film really did other than expose some of these individuals.  It seemed in the end to be more about the film crew than the people they were seeking out.
The music is pretty cool and adds a nice effect to the documentary flavor but this film is ultimately mere dabbling in a highly complex subject. The title is really poor as well as the characters in the end never really emerge and the viewer is left with the taste that they are still 'mole people' rather than real human beings.
