I'm what you call a film buff and I watch everything that's in the movie theaters and there is no movie filled with more laughter, poise, and an unresistable score like  The Parent Trap. I didn't expect to like this movie and I ended up seeing  it 4 times in the movie theaters. It's so good I've been watching it on  video every day since I bought it. A great Christmas gift for all ages!",913852800,,440,4.214285714285714
974893,5,6305177473,"I see that most viewes are from the U.S. Here is the take from Singapore! It's a 'Fab' show, one that will leave you all happy and cheerful once the credits roll. If there was a movie under the 'feel good' catagory, this  would be on top. Lohan is great as the twins, after this show, it gives a  whole new meaning to girl power!
A must see!",913420800,,341,4.0
974894,5,6305177473,"Fabulous movie. Lohan, Richardson, and Quaid were wonderful in this remake of the classic Disney movie. I would recommend it for any family movie night!",913075200,,152,5.12
974895,5,6305177473,I haven't laughed so much in a long time.  If you are in a down mood this movie will definetly lift your spirits.  I thought all the actors did a wonderful job.  Lindsay did a good job in playing two roles.  I liked this  version of Parent Trap much better than the earlier version in the 1960's.  I saw this movie twice by myself and once with my wife. If you get a chance  to see this movie don't pass it up.,911865600,,410,3.926829268292683

975427,5,6305177473,"In the Movie,  Annie and Hallie run into each other by accident and camp an realize that it had to be more than just a coincidence. The story shows the decision of two parents in the past who dealt with their mistakes by staying apart. Just like we learned in class, parents often separate to make it easier for the kids, but this leads to them splitting the kids up. As the story progresses the audience member goes from seeing their parents in the view of the twins being shaky, to understanding why everything was done in the first place. Each child has a missing piece of them that is missing. As Hallie was with Nick, she missed having a mother figure in her life. Even though her father had a female presence in the home, she could not see Meredith as ever being fit to be her mom. Nick being in America and Elizabeth in London, we can see the differences in how the girls look based on where they live. Annie ends up having to cut her hair and pierce her ears in order to fit in with the laid-back American lifestyle, while Hallie has to spruce up and look more elegant than she usually is required to. They learn each other's way of speaking so that their parents don't know whats happening. However, like any good parents, they know when their child is acting differently. When the parents are brought together, they realize that their split up is something that they might now have wanted after all. Like most separated women who are successful, Elizabeth feared getting remarried but for the sake of true love and her children, she gave it another chance.",1512691200,,1566,4.475524475524476
975428,5,6305177473,"This is a classic tale that has an outrageous spin to it. The two main characters who are sisters were separated when they were younger when their parent split up. The two never knew about the other until they met at a summer camp and decided to swap places to learn about the parent they did not grow up with. This movie describes how children treat step parents when they are first brought into the picture The girls were trying to get rid of her, which they did. The family had to go through a divorce and separation then got back together in the end. This movie is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that families go through.",1512691200,,627,4.367521367521367
975479,5,6305177473,"Due to the split of their parents they have a single family households, which didn't take away any of the aspects each of them needed to grow up correctly. The mother and father were both successful and were able to fulfill all the financial needs of their children. They also showed the girls love and affection, and punished them when they misbehaved. Their families may have been different than the normal family structure but it seemed to fit them. However, the girls often asked for the missing parent as they got older due to the societal structure of family that surrounded them. I absolutely love this movie !!",1512604800,,618,4.731481481481482
975480,5,6305177473,"The Parent Trap both idealizes the nuclear family ideal and argues that a single-parent family can be more beneficial than a family with parents who are not emotionally committed to the family. Twin girls who were separated at birth after their parents divorce meet at summer camp and decide to reunite their parents in order for them to fall in love again. They hope the family will be reunited as a perfect nuclear family. However, their plan is at risk when they return home after camp to learn that their father is planning on marrying a new, younger woman whose only intention is to marry for money rather than for the family. Luckily, the father recognizes that she has malicious intentions and he prioritizes the well-being of his daughters over his own marriage to her, even if it means he will remain single. The movie ends happily with the parents ending up together, meaning the twins will no longer have the ""separated at birth"" title following their title of ""twins.""",1512432000,,980,4.770588235294118
975481,5,6305177473,"This movie is about a family that was split for a long period of time. The couple Nick Parker and Elizabeth James meet and got married on an ocean cruise call the Queen Elizabeth. The couple has twin daughters and shortly after they are born the parents get a divorce. After the divorce, the parents decided each parent will raise one daughter and not tell about their sister. Nick raised Hallie in Nape, California where he became a rich wine grower. Elizabeth took Annie to London and was a well-known wedding gown designer. After the agreement, they went their separate ways and lost contact with each other. The family reconnects when the parents both sign up their daughter for the same summer camp. The girls first meet playing fencing and weren't fond of each other. They start a prank war and end up in the Isolation Cabin. The girls learn they are sisters from a torn wedding picture. At the end of the summer they switch places. The family gets together at a hotel because Nick and his evil finance are there to meet her parents. Nick runs into Elizabeth and realizes what the girls did.

Her  character's name was ""Vicki"" in both movies, I believe. Your homework for the day is ""What was that actress's name""?",1485216000,7,494,4.613636363636363

I'd had this movie for decades in VHS format, but not only wanted DVD, but I wanted the bonus features.  This ""Double Trouble Edition"" might make some people think it is two of the various Parent Trap movies.  (There are various versions and sequels.)  But this is only one movie, but with extended Bonus Features.  I'm angry that these Bonus Features are so short--that alone should knock two stars off my review, but the movie is too awesome to feel an impact.  Some of the Bonus Features explain how challenging this movie was to create because of requiring one child playing two people with very different personalities, AND how spectacular Lindsay Lohan was in dealing with the challenge.  I'm disappointed she went on to make such a mess of her life.  It supports some theories that children shouldn't be allowed in show business.  BUT I'm certain such a law would wipe family movies off the face of the earth and we'd be stuck watching stuff like Seinfeld and The Big Bang Theory.",1480809600,,1145,4.623762376237623

976710,5,6305177473,"The Parent Trap is a film that provides us with many family related themes. One of the major themes is joint custody of the twins. When the twins were just born it was decided that the mother would take Annie and the father would take Hallie. This means that the responsibilities of each of these girls lies in the hands of the parent they are residing with, with no child support from the opposite parent. Another theme that is depicted is nuclear and extended family. The nuclear family in this case for Hallie is her father Nick while Annie's is her mother Elizabeth. The extended family would include the others they with such as: Chessy, Martin, and the grandfather. Because of the fact that the parents are divorced and Nick has a fiance, Meredith, this brings into play the idea of step parents. In this film the girls are not thrilled by their soon to be step mother and do anything in their power to change that fact. This movie is filled with tons of family related themes and these are only a few that were major and obvious.",1478563200,,1036,4.4867724867724865

977004,4,6305177473,"My kids are 9 (boy) and 7 (girl) and they both loved it, and so did we. I grew up loving the Haley Mills version and this one is just as fun. Lindsay Lohan, still so full of prmise at this point of her career, is adorable in both roles. It's challenging finding movies that the grown-ups enjoy watching alongside the kiddos but this is that rare gem. Highly recommend. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it runs ling and gets slow toward the end, which makes it tough for kids to stick with. Regardless it's still charming and sweet with a fun storyline, providing the perfect time-filler for a long plane ride.",1474156800,7,621,4.316239316239316

  this version is a wonderful remake of the original from 55 years ago.  because it has been updated with scenes and attire, it seems a lot more interesting.  despite what the modern day main star is doing now, she was a great actress at this stage in her interesting career. does san francisco and the bay area make any movie better?  it does for us.  the acting by all of the stars was just fabulous.  actually, dennis quaid's girlfriend does look like ""cruella.""  a great movie for all ages...",1460073600,3,503,4.511111111111111

It was heart warming film as well as funny at the same time. It made me so happy and made me smile all through the movie and I felt so good for the whole evening.
Nency made movies like <THE INTERN><IT's COMPLICATED><SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE><WHAT WOMEN WANTS>. She also wrote <FATHER OF THE BRIDE 1,2> for her husband as well.
As seeing her movie, she must have grown from the happiest family in her life for sure.
When watching her movies, I always feel that happy feeling and that's her charactor I think.
I'm not gonna tell anything about this movie since so many people already said so much about it but just one thing, this is not a kid movie.

981746,5,6305177473,"I can't say I have a favorite version of The Parent Trap because they are both fantastic, Hayley Mills is wonderful but Lindsay Lohan does a great job in this contemporary re-make of a classic. The beautiful Natasha Richardson makes for a perfect mom and Dennis Quaid fits the laid-back dad type just great. One of the things I love the most about this film is that they have Hallie and Annie from California and London, instead of California and Boston. The international element adds a lot to the story and the supporting cast is no less fantastic, simply hilarious. I have liked this film for a long time and my friends and I quote it often- this DVD is a great copy, crisp clear with good sound and the special features are awesome-there's a great audio commentary and some featurettes. The musical score by Alan Silvestri is tops! From beginning to end, this film is delightful and a breath of fresh air.

982151,4,6305177473,"Growing up whenever my friends and I had sleepovers the movie we would always choose is the classic 1998 Disney remake of The Parent Trap directed by Nancy Meyers. As young girls, we loved watching this romantic comedy about two young spunky twin girls, Annie and Hallie, whom didn't know each other existed until they mysteriously met at camp. They then proceeded to switch places to meet the opposite parent from which they had not lived with for the past 11 years. When the girls switched and were in each others homes they tried to get their parents back together, so they could be a family again; hence the romance part of the movie that any girl growing up would want to see.

Of course watching it now, I see it differently than I did when I was a child. As a kid being ignorant of the fantasy like story or the coincidences throughout the movie, like the fact that both parents send the twin girls to the same camp at the exact same time or when later in the movie the mom is designing the wedding dress of the evil woman who is marrying the twins dad. I also believe that the movie is more of a fantasy than a romantic comedy; which I guess you could argue that all romantic comedies are these days, when the boy and the girl fall in love in a couple of days or weeks and they live happily for the rest of their lives. For example, when the parents are tricked by their 11 year old daughters to meet up and fall in love all over again. Even after 11 years of the parents not talking, because things didn't end well the first time; the mom throwing a blow dryer at the dad and leaving, but now only after days they will be just fine this time around. Dont get me wrong I still love to watch this classic movie and I am always up for a good romance movie as long as its not too unrealistic.

As a child I remember always laughing at the tricks that the girls played at first doing tricks to each other at camp like Annie putting Hallies and her friends beds on her cabin roof or Hallie wrecking Annies whole cabin with honey, shaving cream, and yarn while they were asleep. Then when both of them were together playing tricks on Meredith like putting her and her air mattresses in the middle of the lake. The humor is a thing that they did right for this movie; even though Im older now I still laugh at the little hidden jokes throughout the whole movie.

I can not applaud Lindsay Lohan enough on her performance on both the girls. Having to act out two different personalities, one being a sassy jokester girl and the other being a proper girl, is difficult enough but she also had to give one girl an english accent. A surprisingly good one in fact for only being an eleven year old girl just starting out in the movie business.  After this movie Lindsay Lohan was on the fast track to having a great movie career ahead of her.

As I said, as long as I can get past the unrealistic movie plot even being older I still enjoy the humor and the acting of this romantic comedy. When I was young, watching Lindsay Lohan in this movie I wanted to be just like her. Now I see her as an adult and in real life and I want to be nothing like her.",1411516800,,3147,4.22093023255814

982646,5,6305177473,"This was a time when Lindsay Lohan didn't seem to be constantly making the entertainment news for one stupid decision or another.  This was a time when she came off as a serious actress.  She had to be to pull off this duel role of twins who find each other at the age of eleven, over a decade after their parents' divorce.  Rather than just give these sisters a few differing characteristics or going all the way and making them complete opposites, the filmmakers created two individual people.  Sure, there are differences and characteristics that are clearly opposite from one another, but that's called ""life"" and ""individuality"".  The bond between these two truly becomes genuine and Lohan is flawlessly playing both sides.  Of course, there are other cast members, including Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine Hendrix, Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz, Ronnie Stevens, and many others.  Everyone is worth watching as the twins hatch and carry out their plot to reunite their quite estranged parents.  It's a film worth watching over and over again, whether you are young or old.

The movie is a five star movie. I don't understand why Lindsay Lohan didn't get an Academy Award for this along with the special effects people who made this movie seamless with her playing two people in most of the scenes.

983278,2,6305177473,"I have to admit a bias on my part; I love the original film and saw no need to make a DOA remake/update version of the same.  A version that fights to both separate itself from the original and mangle its memory with watered down versions of identical sequences/dialog.  This version is redundant and not a little cynical in its approach.  They manage to make the marriage between Quaid and Richardson just a silly shipboard romance that instantly falls apart resulting in a quickie divorce and the casual parceling out of their daughters (never intending for them to ever meet or realize the other existed).  But since they're both rich, they can do that with impunity.

Most of the so-called `additions/improvements' to the story are handled in an energetic but preposterous fashion (such as the fencing match and the heavy furniture moved to a rooftop by a bunch of little girls).  It all feels highly manufactured just for effect.  They've also crammed the plot with too many pop references (that date this film immediately) and a ton of distracting musical selections.  What was once cute and charming is now cloying, forced, and obvious.  It plays like a bad case of one-upmanship.

For the adults, it was kind of bittersweet to watch the late Natasha Richardson, and a young, unspoiled Lindsay Lohan.  They are both so talented, but I think that knowing what has become of these two gifted actresses mitigated our enjoyment of the film.  I do hope to someday see Ms. Lohan get her life on track.

983753,5,6305177473,"I remember seeing the trailer for The Parent Trap in the summer of 1998. I had already seen and enjoyed the original 1961 movie but was quite impressed by what I had seen in the trailer. Unlike many of the remakes that are coming out these days, this looked quite refreshing and an unexpected hit from Disney. So when I finally saw the film two times in the theater that August, I couldn't have been more impressed. Yes, this maybe the only movie to date that I viewed in the theater twice and for my vote, it was for good reason.

This is a fun, witty and sweet little movie that I continue to enjoy. A lot of this is due to Disney getting Nancy Myers to co-write the screenplay and direct the film. She had been writing screenplays for years by this time and even had a few hits in her resume, Father Of The Bride Parts 1 and 2 being the most successful. To make her directorial debut, she agreed to helm a remake of the classic 1961 film for Disney. They couldn't have hired anyone better. A tremendous talent in screen writing and directing and deserves to be placed with Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder. While this is you could say a children's film, Myers provides enough class and wit that people of all ages can enjoy it.

As for the cast, everyone did a great job and bring a lot of humor and sensitivity to the characters. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson was amazing casting and both play the mother and father roles in the most believable way. I enjoy their scenes together. Of course, there is the delightful Lindsey Lohan. I really don't know what to say about her personally but as an actress, she is a remarkable talent and this movie shows it. I remember being impressed by the trailer at her capabilities to pull it off. She's quirky, fresh and fun to watch in both roles as Hallie and Annie.

Dean Cundey was the cinematographer on this film who is known for his wide variety of work, from Halloween (1978) to The Thing (1982), from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) to Jurassic Park (1993), from Apollo 13 (1995) to The Parent Trap. Because of his brilliance, he was brought in for the film's amazing technical work. Montion control had been used before many times and even Nancy Myers herself has said that she wasn't sure how it works but it is used to astonishing effect here. With Lohan's talent to play the wisecracking Hallie and proper Annie, motion control allows you to appreciate the differences in the two twins and also, the similarities. My favorite shot in the movie is when Lohan as both Hallie and Annie are looking in the mirror after Annie gets her hair cut. A one shot that gives the young actress in both roles a chance to walk in and out of frame as well as give lots of dialog.

All in all, this is a great movie in my opinion. It's a feel good movie with a lot of charm and as I say class that I highly recommend it. Rent it or better yet, buy it if you ever get the chance.",1346284800,4,2931,4.343065693430657

983857,4,6305177473,"The Parent Trap... a remake that is almost as good as the original! I really love this movie and would give it 5 stars except for the fact that I've seen and adore the original. This movie didn't try hard enough to be its own story. There is too much identical dialogue. That in itself would not be a problem. The problem comes from borrowing things from the original that would not make sense if you had not seen the original. Meredith bangs sticks together to keep mountain lions away during the camping trip. No explanation. The girls get goose bumps. So what?

Some of the stuff was overdone. No one - especially little girls - are putting beds on a roof! Two little girls on opposite sides of the world would not be experts in sword-fighting. I took a class in fencing in college, and while that scene may have looked simple, it was probably 20 pages of choreography, seriously. And did that lizard really need to go into Meredith's mouth? That was just gross.

I have to wonder why they didn't just use real twins for this version. In 1961, for the Hayley Mills version, it seems like they were showing off what they could do, with split-screen technology just coming into play, and that era's version of green screen. Now (or in 1998) they could do pretty much everything anyway, so why bother making it more difficult? But in any case, Lindsay Lohan did an amazing job, just as good as Hayley Mills. Although... it was sort of sad to watch her during the special features... she came off as such an eager, intelligent child, and these days she really needs to get her act together. I still think she's pretty talented, so I hope she comes around.

I still think this movie is hilarious, though. Here is what I loved. Chessie was a much better housekeeper than the maid in the first version. What was up with the maid saying to Mitch in the original, ""You don't know what a good thing you had when you had it?"" That was just so rude! Chessie was so much better, wanting to hug Annie when she found out Hallie was Annie. And she was just funnier and sweeter in general. Getting the original Vicky (Joanna Barnes) to play future mother-in-law Vicky was a stroke of genius. (Too bad they couldn't get another original actor or two.)

One last thing... Natasha Richardson may have been nice, but the way they called her beautiful... I'm sorry but she is just a typical, late 20th century blonde. Doesn't compare to the glamour of Maureen O'Hara. She was a real beauty. Just gorgeous.",1335830400,,2486,4.505543237250555

983865,5,6305177473,"Any movie that begins with Nat King Cole singing "" L O V E"", and concludes with his daughter Natalie singing "" This Will Be(an Everlasting Love)"", as ""The Parent Trap"" does is all right in my books, I'm a big fan of both.  The good news is there is much more to appreciate about this 1998 remake of the classic Walt Disney original from 1961.  It's bright, funny, charming and endearing and is hands down one of the best remakes of a classic, affectionately updating it without losing any of it's original warmth and appeal.  This is really saying something since the first sets a high standard for a remake to match; yet it accomplishes this.

The story concerns two identical 11-year-old twin girls that are separated as infants  when their parents divorce.  Hallie (Lindsay Lohan) remains with her father Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) who owns a wine vineyard in Napa, California whereas Annie (Lindsay Lohan) goes to London with her English born mother Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) who is a successful designer of wedding dresses.  After a chance meeting during summer camp at Camp Walden, Maine the twins discover the truth.  Both girls want to know the other parent, so Hallie comes up with the suggestion they switch places.  Annie points out that at some point their parents will have to switch them back, and hopefully since their parents are still single they can get them reconciled.  So they prep each other on the other's life, Annie gets her hair cut and ears pierced to match Hallie's and off they go.  However a complication emerges in the person of Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), a young, slick, blonde bombshell that has caught Nick's attention over the summer.  They are engaged and plan to be married in two weeks!  Hallie and Annie have to come up with a foolproof plan to prevent this pronto!

The casting in inspired, Lindsay Lohan is just perfect, every bit as good as Hayley Mills was in the original.  She creates two separate entirely different girls so effortlessly and completely that you forget it's just the one actress.  Ms. Lohan wins you over with her captivating naturalness; she's irresistible without being overly cute and winsome, and as Annie speaks in a flawless British upper class accent.  Both Dennis Quaid with his engaging grin, and ever-present mischievious twinkle and the radiantly lovely, gentle Natasha Richardson as the parents contrast effectively with their original excellent counterparts Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara.  They are a kid's dream parents, and like Keith and O'Hara have a matchless charisma.  Elaine Hendrix as Meredith is a terrificly funny Disney villainess, and in a nice piece of symmetry Joanna Barnes who played her part initially plays her mother this time around.  Two outstanding supporting comic performances are given by Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy, the Parker's savvy, wisecracking housekeeper/nanny and Simon Kunz as Martin, the James soft hearted, sentimental butler.

Director and co- writer  Nancy Meyers has a loving touch and feel for the original material and she manages to update the film without diminishing the original.  Charles Shyer also does journeyman work as producer and co - writer.  The cinematography takes us to two glorious locations London and Napa, it made me want to revisit the first and go to the second!  And the musical score by Alan Sylvestri with it's clever mix of standards and rock bridges the generation gap easily.  All in all it adds up to a film as captivating as a sun splashed, breezy, carefree morning in June.

The special features are well worth a look, the best is the short ""Updating a Classic"" which is a look back at making the film, next best after that ""How Hallie became Annie"" featurette, there is a deleted scene called ""Meeting the Queen"" which is interesting to watch with all the detail, but on seeing it and listening to the director's commentary on why it was cut, you can understand and agree.  Finally there is an audio commentary with Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, which certainly adds to the viewer's appreciation of the movie.

This is the perfect family film, both parents and children will enjoy it, it's sheer lighthearted fun that will make you feel good, no message, it just wants to give the viewer a happy time, it does.  I speak from experience my son loved this film from when it opened when he was four until he was seven or so, girls will appreciate it much longer I'm sure.  Both my wife and I still love it, but we find it's a little bittersweet watching it now after the tragically early death of Natasha Richardson and the train wreck Lindsay Lohan has become in the last few years, but still I can't recommend it highly enough as a family fun film.

983937,4,6305177473,"The Parent Trap(1998) is a remake of the 1961 version of The Parent Trap starring Hayley Mills. Both films are based on Erich Kastner's novel Das Dopplete Lottchen. Director Nancy Myers succeeds in keeping the film from getting campy and she does justice to the original 1961 Parent Trap. She also wisely updated the film for people watching it in 1998. A picture of Ricky Nelson is replaced with a picture of Leonardo DiCaprio. The film stars a young Lindsay Lohan when she still had a squeaky-clean image! The story is familiar: two similar looking girls meet at summer camp. They find out that they really are twin sisters. They plot to have their divorced parents get married to eachother again, but a golddigging, sexy blonde woman is after their father and his fortune. Hayley Mills sang 'Let's Get Together' in the original Parent Trap and Lindsay Lohan whistles the tune in this movie. The writers borrow some dialouge from David Swift's script for the 1961 Parent Trap. This Parent Trap remake earned its PG rating. There's a graphic shot of Lohan getting her ears pierced by a needle! Alan Silvestri's music score for The Parent Trap remake is quite solid. This Parent Trap remake is better than those bland, low budget Parent Trap sequels made for television.",1306713600,,1270,4.830275229357798

983939,4,6305177473,"Lindsay Lohan might not be the best role model anymore, but she was adorable in her movie debut, the Parent Trap. This 1998 version is a remake of another movie, and so the overall plot is pretty predictable. There is a couple, they break up after their twin daughters are born, and the twin daughters don't find out about each other until they meet at summer camp. The pranks they pull on each other and eventually other characters are pretty funny, and the overall romance between the parents (and another pair in the movie!) is sweet.

Again, the plot isn't new or anything, but at the time, I guess the technology they used was. Lindsay Lohan obviously doesn't have a twin, but I was convinced she did, because the graphics were good and Lohan played the double roles well. The two daughters she played aren't as unique towards the end of the movie as they were in the beginning, but it's not that bad. I'd still love to watch this movie again, even though I already have about 10 times.",1292457600,,991,4.5055555555555555
983940,5,6305177473,"When this movie came out in 1998, I was seven years old: so, I'm a part of the original target audience.  And I grew up with this film, ever since it aired on TV.  But I'm pretty sure that I'd still adore ""The Parent Trap"" if it wasn't a nostalgic childhood memory; it's one of those rare films that actually holds something for all ages.

Of course, the plot is quite fantastical and doesn't bear too much scrunity; but you're not supposed to overthink the movie, just to sit back and enjoy it.  Several other reviewers have expressed distate for the idea that two parents could split and seperate twin daughters; yes, in reality, that would be a horrific situation.  But ""The Parent Trap"" isn't reality; it's a beautiful fantasy.  Certainly as a kid I wasn't at all worried by the parents' situation, I was too captivated by the fun and romance and luxury, and the fact that they were going to get back together to live happily ever after.

I must make special mention the mother Elizabeth James (wonderfully played by the late Natasha Richardson), who is surely the idealized image of a mother; loving, a beautiful and elegant wedding-gown designer, and with a mischeivous streak to match her daughters.  The only downside to Richardson's great portrayal is that surely no real mother could measure up to this Hollywoodified image.

Of course that's the other concern; that the movie will set children who come from broken homes up for disappointment, when real life doesn't turn out like the movie.  But director Nancy Myers cleverly works against this by making both girls come from rich families, setting the story firmly in fantasy.  This also allows for beautiful sets and supporting characters of the butler and the nanny, played charmingly by Simon Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter.  I remember being fascinated by the beautiful London townhouse with all its ornaments.

As for any other concerns about the film not being child-friendly, I think they're misplaced.
-Yes, the baddie Meredith is a hot young thing; but as a kid, the only impression her flirting with Nick made on me was that I disliked her more (and the one line ""That's why they have Do Not Disturb signs..."" should go over the heads of anyone too young to know about that)
-Yes, the film includes alcohol; Nick Parker owns a vineyard of course.  But the scene in which Hallie (pretending to be Annie) samples some wine is harmless; she's taste-testing, not throwing it back, and it's a comedic moment as she shows off Hallie's knowledge of wine (which Annie should lack).  As for Elizabeth's drunk scene, it's hilarious, and it's not exactly going to corrupt the youth.  Mum's terrified of seeing Dad again because she's secretly still in love with him, so she has a little too much vodka...So what, really?  I watched that scene when I was little, and I for one haven't grown up to be a raging alcoholic.  In my opinion, Elizabeth is more of a lady than Maureen O'Hara in the original film, leaving her bra lying around the father's house!  How is that 'child-friendly'?!

Basically, ""The Parent Trap"" is a beautiful, harmless family fantasy.  And more than that, it carries real emotional weight.  When both girls first meet the mother or father they've lived without for eleven years, it's a really beautiful moment; it sure brings  a tear to the eyes of my family.  And Lindsay Lohan really was a very talented little actress, her double performances are brilliant.

""The Parent Trap"" is a movie with enough happiness and heart to make anyone want their own happily ever after.",1292198400,6,3550,4.770867430441898

I know everyone says that, but I was really feeling it in the case of THE PARENT TRAP.  I don't even know who directed the original, but to me, I wouldn't care if Ewe Boll decided to remake 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, VERTIGO, or THE SEARCHERS, but leave THE PARENT TRAP alone!  And so I existed, in a cold vacuum of contempt, for ten years or more until, accidentally changing the channel, I saw a little red head girl who looked strangely familiar.  I clapped my hands and my wife came into the room, took a look, and commented, ""Oh, is that Druggie when she was a child?""

""Druggie?""

I didn't recognize the girl, and then it hit me that it was Lindsay Lohan.  Wow, what a plain little thing, but then I remember Hayley Mills was not exactly a Jon Benet type either.  Anyhow I was hooked when I saw there were two of Lindsay, and from then on I figured out it was the hated PARENT TRAP remake.  My verdict?  She is a fantastic little actress and full of original, fresh ideas.  Dennis Quaid?  Much better than Brian Keith!  What's her name Redgrave who plays the mother?  Not as good as Maureen O'Hara, why even try, should have gone in another direction.  The servants?  Horrible little storyline--sorry servant fans.  I'd give it five stars except for two things,

Why not have the two Lindsays sing ""Let's Get Together""?  I have all of Lindsay's records and I'm here to tell you, that girl can sing (with studio help of course).  All through the movie I was feeling anxiety about how on earth they were going to top the two Hayley's singing the number at the dinner they had planned to bring their parents together.  Well, Lindsay and Lindsay put on the dinner, but never brought out the ukelele or whatever.  Lindsay sings a smidgin of the tune while waiting for the elevator, and Alan Silvestri's score manages to quote the familiar refrain once or twice, but it is not the same!  Waiting that long for something that never comes, is like, well, I can't say what it is like, not in a review of a family film!

Secondly, they still have never explained why Dennis Quaid and Redgrave designer woman ever split up and each took one of the twins and then never told either one!  It seems so cruel and horrible.  You'd think Family Services would step in, and take both kids away from each selfish parent, and give them to a needy family who would care for them both equally.  What kind of parents give away their kids, content never to see them again except for the summer camp mixup!

The real amazment however comes from the selection of one actress (like the movie from 1961) to play two parts and it's implametation, unlike the Olsen twin movies, and enhancing it to a perfectly done technological breakthrough that REALLY makes you think the two characters are two girls.

984119,5,6305177473,"I was a huge fan of the 1961 original film version of ""The Parent Trap"" during my formative years. Hayley Mills gave a lively and spry performance in her dual role as the twin sisters raised on opposite sides of the U.S. who meet at a girl's camp, discover the truth about their relationship amid some antagonism, and scheme to reunite their divorced parents.
 Some 37 years later, audiences had the pleasure of viewing an innocent red-haired  freckle-faced Lindsay Lohan inhabit the same role with a squirrel-like, beady-eyed impishness.
Free-spirited  Hallie Parker arrives at Camp Walden from the vineyard where she lives with her father, Nick (Dennis Quaid) in Napa Valley, California. She makes friends, but soon has an initially unfortunate run-in with a more conservatively raised look-alike camp mate from England named Annie James, the daughter of London-based fashion designer Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson). The two begin a series of malicious pranks against each other and their tentmates, which ultimately result in the camp leader (Polly Holiday) sending them to the Isolation Tent. Gradually, the girls address their grievances, and in talking, discover they're twins, and form a plan of action that will enable them to get to know the parent they had missed, and ultimately bring their parents back together.
 Their isolation from other camp mates gives them more time to focus on each other and their plan. Annie undergoes a few physical alterations(Haircut, ear-piercing) to make her look more like her twin.
  When Hallie travels to London, all goes smoothly, and she is brought  home by her family's posh but hip butler, Martin (Simon Kuntz). She meets her grandfather(Ronnie Stevens) as he is in his study. But her reunion with her mother is a particularly emotional one.
 Soon the two pass the famous Abbey Road as they cover the brief distance between home and  Elizabeth's fashion studio. Hallie is deeply impressed and excited seeing her mother at work, but drops subtle hints about Annie's desire to know her father.
 Annie arrives in California as Hallie, greeted by her father and her strong and warm-hearted nanny, Chessy(Lisa Ann Walter). But there is a hitch in the sisters' plan to reunite their parents when publicist Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), whom Nick began dating while Hallie was at camp, sets her sights on becoming the next Mrs. Parker, and Annie and Chessy know she is only in it for Nick's money.
 Accompanied by Martin, Elizabeth and Hallie travel to California so that the twins can be switched back.
 As the parties involved arrive at the Stafford Hotel in San Francisco, we are treated to a cameo by the original ""Parent Trap"" cast member, Joanna Barnes--once the vixen to be eliminated--now playing the mother of one. The major parties pass each other by , but eventually converge, and the meeting of the two servants provides an interesting subplot. The reunion of the two ex-spouses here is less volatile than in the 1961 version and Natasha Richardson has a chance to be less dignified, and in fact, goofier than Maureen O'Hara.
 The parents dine together amicably when the girls recreate their first date, but the next day, it appears the two halves of the family will remain apart, and Nick Parker take the treacherous Meredith as his bride.
 What will the girls do? All they have in their favor are the remaining days of summer, a significant outing, and the power of identicallness. Will it be enough?",1208908800,,3467,5.006956521739131

984125,5,6305177473,"If you want to watch something sweet, something fun and something memorable look no further than Disney's 90's remake of `The Parent Trap'.  It's funny, it's charming and it's sure to be appreciated time and time again.  Young Lindsay Lohan is so preciously sweet here that you can't help but fall in love with her.  And talk about talent.  This young actress may not have really struck it big until her `Mean Girls' stint, but `The Parent Trap' may very well hold her finest performance to date.  She's convincing as two totally separate children, accent included, and that is a tough feet for most adult actors.  But here Lohan pulls it off with flying colors, never once missing a beat.

The film follows the original film, at least in general plot, but it updates it quite a bit for modern society.  Lohan plays both Annie James and Hallie Parker.  Hallie lives in California with her father Nick, played by Dennis Quaid while Annie lives in London with her mother Elizabeth, played by Natasha Richardson.  When they first meet at summer camp they are camp rivals, but soon after realizing they are in deed sister, identical twin sisters, they devise a plan to reunite their parents and become a family again.  They swap places, each getting to meet and spend time with the parent they've never known and then, when their secret is exposed and they're forced to swap places again their parents will see one another and the wheels will be set in motion for their love to rekindle.

There's only one problem.  Their father is falling in love with a horror show of a hot young thing named Meredith Blake, played brilliantly by Elaine Hendrix.  Annie realizes soon after meeting her father that she is in way over her head with his new arm-candy.  She's manipulative and beautiful and her father is obviously blinded by her legs.  Hallie doesn't believe the danger is real for as far as she knows her father is never serious about any woman and besides the fact, she wants to spend more time with her mother.  But the problem is serious for her father intends on marrying the gold-digging tramp and if that happens the girls plan would be ruined.

The hi-jinx's that ensue are hilarious and the acting is superb.  Lohan outshines all, but both Quaid and Richardson do a wonderful job as the two loving parents. In fact, they are both so lovable and charming that it's hard to understand why their marriage didn't work in the first place.  As I mentioned, Hendrix is deliciously evil here and works her character to the bone.  My favorite supporting character though is Lisa Ann Walter who plays Nick's housekeeper.  She's effortlessly charming and sweet and so good natured.  I just love her character and her interacting with Lohan is fantastic.  Simon Kunz is memorable as the James' butler and Ronnie Stevens is more than effective as Elizabeth's father.

The film is a wonderful experience from start to finish and monopolizes very well on the charm of the entire cast and the popularity of the original film.  It's a remake that was worth being remade and it'll be sure to bring plenty of smiles to the faces of everyone in the family.  As many have mentioned, Lindsay's life has taken a huge detour down to the gutter, but put your preconceived notions about her off-screen antics aside and embrace the career she could have had had she stayed cute and adorable and level headed.",1185753600,,3385,4.702886247877759
984172,4,6305177473,"I am sure the reason ""The Parent Trap"" is airing on cable television today is not because of Lindsay Lohan's arrest this past week but more because this past Friday ""I Know Who Killed Me"" opened.  So you have to appreciate that they are showing Lohan's first movie on television the same weekend that what may well be her last movie is opening in theaters.  It is hard to watch this 1998 remake of the 1961 Haley Miles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/film/dp/B00005RRG9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">film</a>&nbsp;of the same name, which is an American version of the German story ""Das Doppelte Lottchen"" by Erich Kstner filmed in 1950, and not wonder what happened to sweet little Lindsay Lohan.  Watching this version again I kept thinking of Rob Schneider's joke on ""The Tonight Show"" about Lohan being worried about losing jobs to the English chick that played opposite her in ""The Parent Trap"" (Erin Mackey was the acting double, but that is not who he mean), but the basic situation is way too sentimental to be caustic and cynical for too long when watching this movie again.

My problem with this movie is neither Lohan nor her performance, but rather the parents and the premise.  I am tempted to review ""The Parent Trap"" as a horror film.  You have these two people, Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) and Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson), who get married and after the birth of twin girls not only get a divorce but decide that to guarantee they never have to see each other ever again they will each take one of their infant daughters and go their separate ways, she to London, England and he to Napa Valley, California.  The fact that the roots of this story go back a half-century to post-war Germany makes a lot of sense to me because I can see circumstances warranting such a separation making a lot more sense than a mother deciding she hates her husband enough to give away one of her children.  I mean, come on, when Solomon offered his 50-50 deal way back when it was not a serious proposition (I want to ask what sort of parents break up immediately following the birth of their children, but Kevin Federline can now go for the hat trick on that score).

Fortunately, we only have to deal with the interaction of the parents in the third act of this film and as a general rule of thumb if there is not at least one Lindsay Lohan in a scene in this film, it tends not to work as well.  The first act finds Hallie Parker and Annie James both arriving at the same Summer Camp (sending your kid to Summer Camp in another country across an entire ocean strikes me as being rather bizarre parental behavior, but it is a necessary plot device in this film).  Eventually the girls will figure out the connection between them, which leads to the second act where they switch places to meet the parent they have never met.  But before that they terrorize each other in an escalating series of camp hijinks that suggest they are forces to be reckoned with individually, so imagine what they can do if they team up.

The second act is far and away the best part of this film because it is pretty much impossible not to be moved when each girl finally gets to meet their other parent and when the parents finally realize what is going on (although my favorite moment is when Annie reveals her true identity to Lisa Ann Walter's Chessy).  Coming clean is mandated because Annie, pretending to be Hallie, learns that their dad is going to marry Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), apparently because he is the only one who cannot tell she is a money-hungry ice queen.  So it is up to the twins to set things right, or at least set their parents up so they can do the right thing.  One of the things that I think are required in a romance is what I call the ""grand gesture,"" and when Nick takes Elizabeth down to his private wine cellar that is exactly what we get.  The two-fold problem is that it does not work and that this particular grand gesture begs the question that needs to be asked of both parents as to why they never bothered to track down their other child.  Part of me thinks that the twins would be better off with Chessy and Martin (Simon Kunz).  If you can suspend your disbelief with regards to the stupidity of Nick and Elizabeth and the horrible thing they did to their daughters, then you can enjoy this film and the Lindsay Lohan that was.",1185667200,2,4400,4.589285714285714

984175,2,6305177473,"I probably am not the best person to review this product as I love the older version with Hayley Mills.  However, I like to consider myself unbiased and open to new versions of the same films.

Plot:
If you've seen the old version of this, you already know this part.  Two girls meet at camp and realize that they are in fact twin sisters.  They switch places to meet their other parents and to attempt to bring their parents back together.  But the father's marriage to a much younger woman may thwart family bliss!

Good:
The actress who played Meredith is absolutely wonderful!  I was never convinced Vicki in the old film was actually young; this ""Vicki"" is most definitely young enough to be Dad's daughter.  Also, Lindsay Lohan makes a cute set of twins.  She does a good job acting like two different people at such a young age.  Dennis Quaid makes a good loving, dorky father while Natasha Richardson shines as the mother.  Lastly, I adored Chessy, the quirky maid.  Seeing the original ""Vicki"" from the old ""Parent Trap"" with the same name (which makes one wonder: where are Susan and Sharon?) was absolute fun!

Bad:
Oh, boy.  Here we go.
1.  How many situations do we have to see that make Annie and Hallie twins?  I can understand the strawberry allergy, but the Oreo/peanut butter thing, fencing, and poker??  How can two girls raised in two different continents with two completely different parents have so much in common?
2.  I think having the mother show up drunk at the hotel was completely unnecessary.  It is funny for laughs, but not appropriate for the target audience (plus, would a formal British woman like Elizabeth really get drunk?).
3.  Chessy and Martin's romance, while cute, was a little over the top.
4.  Elizabeth and Nick's romance was whirlwind (no wonder they divorced so soon after!).  Their breakup was silly (at least the way that they explained it in the movie: that Elizabeth expected Nick to chase her down.  Puhlease!  Grow up!).  Their chemistry was great, but I just couldn't believe their history.
5.  Grandfather was not an integral part of the show.  He became eclipsed by Martin.  This wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't been the one to get the truth from Hallie at the phone booth.
6.  The stunts the girls performed to antagonize each other were not feasible.  I don't know many girls that can disassemble beds, haul them to the roof, and reassemble them in the time it takes for three girls to go on a hike.
7.  Last major beef: so many of the lines are cut and paste from the old version, but not delivered with the same energy or don't make sense in the new context.  Or situations (such as the sticks and the mountain lions) are presented without the necessary explanations.

Dialoge/Sexual Situations/Violence
Dialogue is mainly restricted to ""Oh my God"" and other exclamations.  Sexual situations will be too much for the younger set (Meredith and Dad discuss hotel rooms, sex is brought up between Hallie and Meredith, a girl jumps in the lake naked, etc.).  Violence is restrained to falling down or smacks across the face.

Overall:
If I could have given 1.5 stars, I would.  The actors are excellent.  However, the main flaws in this film are its riding off the old film and uninventiveness.  Further, this is much more risque than its older counterpart.  Good for the younger (but not too young) set, but adults will see the flaws and not be able to enjoy.",1184457600,4,3424,4.660535117056856
984176,4,6305177473,"Lindsay Lohan made her first appearance in this latest remake of the Disney classic based on the German children's book.  Two girls meet at summer camp.  Other than their styles, they look exactly the same.  When their hatred of each other forces them to be isolated together they learn the truth.  They are sisters.  Their parents split up and each took one of the twins and never mentioned the other.  Wanting to see their other parent, the girls switch places.  When the parents find out about the switch they will have to get together to make an exchange of siblings.

But there is a snag.  The father is about to get remarried.  Now everything has to be sped up if there is any hope of getting the parents back together again.  Revelations and madcap hijinks make up the rest of the film as the twins do everything in their power to stop the wedding and reunite their parents.

Much better than the Olsen Twin remake.  While much of the story is very close to the original, it has been properly updated.  The parents were a shipboard romance that failed.  Newer technology has Lohan beside herself even more than Hayley Mills was.  The rest of the cast is excellent and Quaid (the father) really shows he is a better actor than he is usually given credit for.  Even the extras are entertaining.  A fun documentary about making Lindsay twins and an extra scene involving the Queen of England.  Fun for the whole family.  Check it out.",1183248000,6,1438,4.564705882352941

984179,3,6305177473,"I vaguely remember the 1961 version of The Parent Trap. I say vaguely because that version of the movie was apparently as equally compelling as the 1998 version...which isn't that compelling. But...my kids enjoyed it thoroughly.

The movie takes place way before Lindsay Lohan's pics could be spotted...or should I say pics of Lindsay's privates could be spotted...all over the Internet. Lindsay plays (both) twins separated at birth by their divorcing parents. When the twins meet up by chance 10 or so years later they come up with a diabolical plan to reunite their parents.

Anyone not familiar enough with the story has been under a rock...perhaps since 1961. Anyone that missed the movie deliberately because it sounds too cutesy and far-fetched has done himself or herself a favor. This is a movie for kids. Adults will be more entertained watching their kids interpret the themes in the movie.

So if you're over the age of 14 and you've somehow found yourself contemplating The Parent Trap as the next movie that you just have to see among all of the other available titles...I would say that life under that rock has taken its toll on you in a most severe way.

If you're looking for a decent movie for your age 6 - 14 year old(s)...this could be the one if your kids can handle a couple of smooches (no...none by Lindsay...Dennis Quaid gets a few kisses from Elaine Hendrix and Natasha Richardson).

984233,1,6305177473,"This remake of ""The Parent Trap"" is definitely not the version for little girls to watch.

Yes, the Haley Mills version does have some inuendoes, the bra left in the bathroom, the mother making rude comments about Vicki's ""electric hips"" but overall it was a decent, clean movie.

I guess one downside to the remake is the omission of the 'Let's Get Together' song, but it was always too syrupy for my taste, so I don't mind that Disney didn't add it to the remake.",1167782400,,864,4.168674698795181
984297,3,6305177473,"This film improves on the original in some ways, subject to reservations which I'll keep to the end.

In the original, one of the girls' hometowns (Boston) was univerally slated ('Boston is no place to rekindle romance'), which is why the reuniting had to take place in Texas. Here, London is not slated in the same way. London is shown as cool, the Abbey Road scene is a treat! The actors all play their parts well, especially the supporting cast (the two domestics are great). The nods to the original - one of the twins humming 'Let's Stay Together' - are also well done.

However, the treatment of Meredith at the end is nothing short of brutal, and even socially irresponsible. When the original was made, divorce was seen as bad; a married couple seen as married forever, and so any 3rd party was seen as an interloper who deserved everything they got. In the 1990s, the makers of the film should have realised that many kids will go to the film with mum or dad PLUS A STEP-PARENT!!! Mrs Doubtfire had a much more responsible take on the realities of divorce than this. Following from this, am not sure parents in the 1980s would split up twins so thet they'd never hear of each other, or of the other parent. That would be downright nasty.",1167264000,6,1246,4.508849557522124
984298,5,6305177473,"Have seen both versions of The Parent Trap and both are excellent. For a first time viewer would recommend the newer 1998 Double Trouble version for first viewing with the original also recommended for second viewing. First because as an adult watching both movies I found the tension between the parents more interesting and believable in the Double Trouble version and second because the print quality of the newer Double Trouble version is/was superior to the vault version of the original. The contrast of print quality is striking because Disney restored the vault version of Pollyanna also starring Hayley Mills and it looks brand new with sharp images, excellent color and a print that is not faded at all whereas the vault version of the original Parent Trap does not have as sharp images, has darkened slightly and the color while good is clearly not of the same quality as the restored Pollyanna vault version. The acting in both Parent Trap versions is excellent including both Hayley Mills and Lindsay Lohan. So would recommend Double Trouble version for first viewing and if you get hooked as I did going for the original version second. The Vault version is loaded with extras, so for me I am glad to have both versions.",1167264000,,1234,4.8530805687203795

Throw in an absolutely charming performance from Dennis Quaid, an ideal mom played by the lovely and talented Natasha Richardson, and a smart and warm housekeeper played by...er, I forget..and you'll see why this film gets so many rave reviews.

Not having seen the Hayley Mills version until I was well into my twenties, I had no warm and fuzzy attachment to that film.  In fact, I thought it started out strong but fizzled early.  Kudos to the screenwriters for deftly following the basic storyline while at the same time infusing it with comedy that is mature without being tasteless.  Oh, and it's actually funny, too.

One aspect of the story that has always tickled me is that these identifical twins meet up at summer camp.  It always reminds me of the summer I was at camp and there were two younger girls who looked so much alike that no one could get the right name with the right girl.  In the end the camp director made them stand up during a Saturday gathering so we could all get a good look at them and mutually agree on their distinguishing features.  Who knows, maybe they were actually related....",1154563200,2,1224,4.527272727272727
984369,4,6305177473,"I vaguely remember the original with Hayley Mills, so I can't really compare this remake, but thanks to Lindsay Lohan's marvelous debut performance, THE PARENT TRAP is a wholesomely entertaining jaunt with twins and their estranged parents.  Lohan brings an inherently natural charm in her dual roles as Annie and Hallie, two twins separated after their parents' divorce, and who don't know each other exists until they stumble on each other at a summer camp.  Once they find out who they are, they conspire to get their parents back together, by switching identities so they can both get to know the parent they haven't known yet.

It's all goofy fun, but Lohan is charming.  Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson fill in nicely as the parents, but it's the supporting cast that adds the great touches:  Elaine Hendrix as the floosy out for Quaid's fortune; Lisa Ann Walters as Chessie, Quaid's laughably endearing housekeeper; and Simon Munz as Martin, the sentimental butler for Richardson.

While a little long in the tooth (other than the sight gags, was the whole camping trip sequrence even necessary?), the movie should prove enjoyable entertainment for the whole family and certainly opened the door for the talented Lohan.",1154217600,,1230,5.064356435643564
984370,5,6305177473,"I saw this re-make most reluctantly. After all, I thought, how could it compare to the original blockbuster hit of the same name, which starred the adorable British actress, Hayley Mills? Well, to my complete surprise, this film is a winner in its own right. Reprising the dual roles played by Hayley Mills, a young Lindsay Lohan, in her silver screen debut, is surprisingly effective and adorable, making the dual roles her own.

For those of you unfamiliar with the premise of the film, two girls, Hallie Parker and Annie James (Lindsay Lohan), meet at summer camp. They look exactly alike. One lives with her father, while the other lives with her mother. They soon figure out the previously unknown but inescapable fact that they are twins, separated shortly after birth, each of whom lives with one of their biological parents. They both long to know the parent that is missing from their respective lives. So, they concoct a plan that will allow them to do so, leading to a scheme to reunite their estranged parents. They simply switch places, when it comes time to return home. Their reunion scheme is almost derailed, however, when their biological father seems to have romantic designs on someone else.

This comedic caper focuses on the intrigues of the twins as they try to get the potential usurper out of their father's life and re-unite their parents. Lindsay Lohan is simply terrific in the dual roles of Hallie and Annie, infusing a great deal of charm and personality into her portrayal of the twins. Natasha Richardson is wonderful in the role of the mother, Elizabeth James. While she lacks the feistiness of Maureen O'Hara, who originally played the role, Ms. Richardson manages to make the role her own with her low-key charm. Dennis Quaid is terrific as Nick Parker, the handsome, hunky father, who is the besotted prey of a gold digging, scheming, statuesque blonde (Elaine Hendrix). I actually like his performance better than that of Brian Keith, who played this role in the original.

Blonde bombshell Elaine Hendrix is effective as Meredith Blake, the potential wicked step-mother, who quickly sees her own scheme to marry a wealthy husband go up in flames as the twins plot against her. Lisa Ann Walter is simply wonderful as Nick Parker's good-hearted housekeeper, infusing the role with a rich warmth. Simon Kunz is very funny in the role of Martin, the James' butler, creating a memorable character, and Ronnie Stevens is perfectly cast as the maternal grandfather, Charles James.

As to whether or not their mother and father will be re-united, as the twins so desire, watch this film and find out. Although Lindsay Lohan does not sing the popular signature song, ""Let's Get Together"", which Hayley Mills sang in the original film, the viewer will not be disappointed by this re-make.

But, all I can say is that if you want a feel good movie to watch when you are a bit down this is the best. It is worth mentioning that I have a plasma and the high definition really helps make this particular movie shine.

I find it interesting to read other reviews that compares this 90's version with the older one.

Perhaps that's just progress, let's hope so.

My only criticism of both film versions has nothing to do with the actualy quality of the entire production, but with the basic concept that ANY decent, loving parent would EVER split up twins.

This movie is decidedly more modern and Lindsay Lohan gives a glorious performance- as both Halley and Annie.

However, the plot is a tad less realistic. It's believable that the owner of a California vineyard would send his kid to the summer camp, would a London designer send her daughter to a summer camp in another country?

I don't think so.

The pranks the two play on each other are less mischievious than that of the original, but the ones played upon Meredith Blake are much more!

The story begins when Halley Parker from Napa, CA meets Annie James from London, U.K. at a summer camp. The two become rivals and play pranks upon the other, until the camp director snaps and has both put in an isolated cabin- together.

Remarkably, Halley and Annie are mirror images of each other, as well as share the same birthday. They are allergic to the same foods and Halley has only a dad and Annie only a mother and only a picture of the other parent. When they show the other their other parent, they recognize them and find out they're twins.

The plan then becomes to switch places and get their parents back together.

The plan moves into action even faster when Dad Dennis Quiad announces his engagement to gold-digger Meredith Blake (not the actress's real name.)",1142121600,2,1344,4.617647058823529

Subsequently, both parents appear to forget they ever had a second child, never bother to tell either twin that the other exists or discuss with them their missing parent. That is the ridiculous premise upon which The Parent Trap is built. And this, one reviewer described as ""good, clean family fun""? Good clean dysfunctional family fun, perhaps.

If you can get beyond the glaring flaws in the plot you'll be impressed by the cast. Lindsay Lohan is exceptional. Even her English accent is flawless - pretty amazing for an actress of any age never mind one of eleven! And it is especially commendable as it is the only accurate reference to England and the English in the entire film.

Example? ""Oreos"" are neither marketed nor sold in England to the best of my knowledge so when Halle/Annie both claim to have always enjoyed eating them with peanut butter it just comes across as clumsy product placement. But then again, Disney's chocolate box version of London only exists in the mind of people who've never visited it.

Annie's relationship with her ""Butler"" is too intimate for a professional relationship and their handshake ritual is, frankly, ridiculous. As is the pairing of said camp butler with butch nanny in the romance stakes.

An odd film, not badly made but still odd. It trivializes divorce and its repercussions in the context of a family entertainment. A contradiction in terms, me thinks. In the real world, parents like these should have been ""trapped"" by social services but that would hardly make for Disney entertainment, would it?!

Despite a curious resemblance, Hallie develops an immediate dislike for Annie, and the feeling is mutual. However, the two eventually discover they are twin sisters separated not long after they were born. Their parents, Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson) and Nick (Dennis Quaid), had met on the Queen Elizabeth 2 and married on that same voyage. After a divorce, Nick brought up Hallie at his Napa Valley vineyard, while Annie lived with wedding-gown designer Elizabeth in London. Neither twin was aware she had a sister, until their summer-camp meeting. To learn more about their parents, they switch places and maintain the deception until Nick states he will remarry. The twins then try to engineer a renewed romance between Nick and Elizabeth, but Nick's annoying but attractive fiancee Meredith (Elaine Hendrix) presents a major problem in reaching their happy-ending goal.

The picture quality  is razor sharp  that if you were to touch  the screen with  your finger, you would get cut!!!  Thats how super  sharp this movie is on this DVD!!

The extras are great.  Theres an original  making of piece which  has Lindsay talking on the set of how fun it is making the movie and theres also  comments from  some of the others who are in the movie.

Theres a neat  special  on how they  did the split screen  process to make it seem as if Lindsay is  interacting with her twin sister!!  Its amazing how good this process is!!

In watching this movie, you really  feel as if  it really is  twin girls. Lindsay did a super job  in playing her 2 roles!!!

The one thing that is missing from this special edition DVD is the trailer to this movie which was included on the original release DVD from a few years ago.

Most of the extras on  this special  edition DVD came off of the laserdisc version  and one thing  they did not  put on this special  edition DVD that is on the laserdisc version is, Lindsay's screen  tests. They should have put this on the DVD but, for some unknown reason  they  did not.

You may ask: ""is this DVD worth getting since I allready have the DVD version that came out a few years ago?"", The answer is YES!Reason is, of course the extras that are on  this and also because the picture quality is much better then the original DVD version,as they did remaster it!!

I really loved this movie, it contained just enough light touches and humor without getting in the way of the character interplay. The premise is familiar to most by now and so I will not go into specifics, in this update we find an English girl and a Californian girl meeting at a New England summer camp and, after some humorous hijinks becoming friends and then realizing they are twins.
I saw this about four times in the movie theater and seem to end up drawm back to it about once a week. It joins the ranks of a very few select number of movies (1980s FLASH GORDON and NORTH SEA HIJACK come to mind) that I can watch over and over again.
I find it funny, chatming, delightful and one of those movies that gives me those nice warm fuzzy feelings all over. It also features a pretty good toe-tapping soundtrack which manages to combine modern hits (for 1998 at least) with the tried and true classics.

I wish the pacing of this film had been slower as it would have been nearly as the original if it had just been slower paced as the actors (especially Lohan) are first rate in their acting.,1102809600,2,247,4.276595744680851
984620,5,6305177473,"The Parent Trap is an excellent example of what it takes to make a great movie.  A good storyline, decent actors, and a positive sentiment to it.  While it will never be compared with classic films such as Gone With the Wind and Lawrence of Arabia, it is still very impressive.  A fine debut film for Lindsay Lohan, she'll look back on this as a great booster to her career.  She was much more impressive than Hayley Mills was, which is saying a lot.

The storyline orginization was also a vast improvement from the original.  The characters were more scrutinized, which makes it all the better.  In the original, it tooks almost a half-hour before we learned the name of one of the twins!  Pretty pathetic.

The girlfriend in the remake (Meredith) actually looks young, unlike in the original where the girlfriend (Vicki) looked older than the father.

The Boston-California connection is pathetic compared to the London-California connection.  As a former Boston resident,I know that the original Parent Trap did a pathetic job in labeling the Boston twin.  Even back in 1961, Boston Brahmins did not come close to resembling her.  The London seen was an improvement.  The Disney producers actually filmed the London scences in London!  And the London twin actually resembled a typical London aristocrat.

I also enjoyed the fact that the parents felt sympathetic to the twins in the remake.  In the original, they appeared more cold-hearted and reticent to accept them.

While the story is predictable, it is still great.  A nice feel-good film which is a good substitute from bloody, action films.  I recommend it to just about anyone.",1093910400,6,1639,4.912408759124087

As a mom I'm happy my daughter has found such an charming and innocent movie she loves, starring the (at that time) adorable Lindsay Lohan. Of course the story isn't exactly realistic (not many of us have heard of divorced couples who wouldn't really remember why they got divorced or have seen divorced parents getting back together). But still, or maybe because of that, it's a sweet story. I think there should be more of this kind of movies instead of those showing too much bare skin and kids pretending to be grownups.

984684,5,6305177473,"When this film was originally released in theatres, I had no desire to see it because I didn't think it could possibly live up to the Hayley Mills version.  Years later, I was flipping channels and saw it featured as the Disney movie of the week, and I fell in love with it!  This version is even BETTER than the original!  So much of the plot mimics the original story (twin girls separated at birth reunite and scheme to get their parents back together), and the small deviations are wonderful, like having one of the twins speak with a British accent (so cute!).
Lindsay Lohan is absolutely adorable in her dual role: I don't think I've ever seen a little girl as charming as she is!  Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are a wonderful couple, and Elaine Hendrix is perfect as the girls' evil stepmother-to-be.  Fans of the original ""Partent Trap"" will enjoy seeing Joanna Barnes in her cameo role as Meredith's mother, Vicki: a great tribute to the character she played in the 1961 version of the film).
The music in this film is fantastic, and I highly suggest that you purchase the soundtrack in addition to the DVD.  However, the one disappointment in this film is that the twin Lindsays don't do a modernized version of ""Let's Get Together,"" which is the song that the twin Hayleys performed for their parents in the original film.  in fact, there's no real musical number in this version at all (although they do briefly pay tribute to the classic song).
Overall, though, this movie is FABULOUS: I'm still kicking myself for not having gone to see it in the theatre, but I'm thrilled to own the DVD!",1085875200,114,1609,4.604895104895105

Complications greet Annie as Hallie in California when she discovers that their dad has gotten engaged over the summer.  His fiancee is a truly horrid woman who will make everyone's lives miserable.  But what can the girls do to change things?
This is pretty much a faithful remake of the original just updated for the 90's.  Lindsay Lohan bravely steps into Hayley Mills' famous double roll, and pulls it off with style.  This is her big screen debut, and she handles the rolls and the special effects with ease, seeming to switch characters convincingly at will.  This is a young actress to watch.  Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are wonderful as the parents caught in the trap.  They have incredible chemistry.  Frankly, I never found the romance in the original that believable, but this movie has romance in spades.  There are some truly great comic moments in the film and plenty of subtle hat tips to the original without slowing down the movie.
The DVD is simple, just the movie.  This was one of the first films that Disney released in the then new format, so that helps explain the lack of extras.  The film does look great in widescreen and sound great in surround, however.
As with any remake, there will be fans of one over the other.  Personally, this one edges out the original, but not by much.  There is plenty of charm and humor here to entertain without taking a thing away from the original.

984760,5,6305177473,"The original version of The Parent Trap was, in my opinion, the best movie to come out of Disney.  Therefore, I wasn't very optimistic about the remake.  So many classics have been remade disastrously that I tend to avoid them if possible.  My curiosity got the better of me with Parent Trap, and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  The remake has a terrific cast and a great soundtrack and updates the story in a completely believable way.  Inevitably remakes are always compared to the originals, so in comparison, I won't say I like the new verion better than the original, because I don't.  As good as Lindsey Lohan is, she lacks the star quality that Hayley Mills radiated.  Lohan is possibly the better actress of the two, but Mills' performance is still captivating 40-some years later. I doubt that Lohan's will hold up as well. Dennis Quaid is serviceable in the Brian Keith role, but Natasha Richardson, though charming, does not have the ravishing beauty nor the spot-on comic timing of Maureen O'Hara.  Wisely, Leo G. Carroll's role in the original wasn't even recast here--who could match him?  Before you fans of the new version hit that ""NO"" button, read on...
Although the basic plot is the same, all of the characters names except one and all the locales and particulars have been changed.  Joanna Barnes, who played the conniving Vicki in the original, plays her character's mother in the new version--still named Vicki.  This leads me to suspect that she is the same character--the Vicki of the original gets married to a rich man, has a daughter named Merrideth, and raises her to be a gold digger just like mom--making the new Parent Trap more of a sequel than a remake.  Far-fetched?  Yes, but in Disney-land anything is possible. Plus, by considering the new Parent Trap a sequel, I don't have to compare them.  There's room for both versions on my DVD shelf.  The original--still my favorite--and the remake/sequel--a funny, warm, and entertaining film--running a close second and quite possibly the best remake ever made!",1064188800,6,2055,4.848137535816619

984767,3,6305177473,"**NOTE: This review has nothing to do with the DVD specifically, but with the film itself.**
Now, granted, I haven't seen the original (being an '80's child...awe yea), but I can assure you it's better. The originals always are. Plus it's gotten dazzling reviews. Now, the remake, which I recorded off of Disney awhile ago.
It tells the same storyline: Two separated, longlost twins (Hallie Parker and Annie James, both played by Lindsay Lohan) are reunited at camp, figuring out that they are twins, and decide to switch places. In the meantime, they have to cut Annie's hair and pierce her ears to make the switch believable. (::shudder:: The ear-piercing scene was horrible...I nearly cried, and therefore didn't get my ears pierced afterward for awhile.) Then we see Hallie in the place of Annie in London with mom Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson) and Annie in Hallie's shoes in Napa, California with dad Nick (Dennis Quaid). Chaos ensues when Annie discovers that Nick is set up to marry Meredith Blake (also called by the girls as ""Cruella""; played by Elaine Hendrix). Then the girls' secret is discovered, and, well...trouble for them.
The England scenes are wonderful...I've always been fascinated by their culture, and this movie portrays it beautifully. The Napa scenes are charming too...what a cool place to live.
Now, the actors. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are very good, and perfect for their roles. Lindsay Lohan is funny, sweet, and good in two roles. But the real shiner is Elaine Hendrix as Meredith. She is so perfectly cast; she's catty, witchy (one letter having been replaced...:-D), and downright detestable as the girlfriend...but I think she was excellent in her role. The other shiners are Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy (the scene where she's crying and Nick calls her on it made me laugh...I rewinded it and I laughed again) and Simon Kunz as the butler. He was very funny, and the grandfather was adorable.
This movie is good fun for the family...though I bet some may be bored with it. I enjoyed it, but not enough to tape over part of it. I think you'll like it, unless you are in dire defense of the original, in which case, you'll see the inferiority. BUT, I think you should check this out for some '90's fun added to a '60's classic.",1031270400,3,2270,4.838046272493573
984768,5,6305177473,"I am a big fan of family/children's movies, but this is one of my very favorites of all time. Lindsay Lohan sparkles as Annie/Hallie...the casting for every last role was nothing less than perfect. The casting directors definitely deserve two thumbs up for a job well done with this movie.
I have seen the Haley Mills (original) Parent Trap dozens of times (my favorite scene is and always has been, of course, the ""Let's Get Together"" duet), but the new version really takes the cake. I really like the story line and the way the screenwriters/directors/etc. encorporated the original into this story. For example, when Hallie (or is it Annie) is humming/singing ""Let's Get Together"" in the elevator...I thought that was a wonderful way to connect this story to the original without it being blunt and in-your-face.
Lohan's Parent Trap easily gets 5 stars from both me AND my husband. Yes, this is one of my husband's favorite movies as well! He was very pleasantly surprised by the charm and sentimentality of this movie and he also loved the casting/acting. Normally, our taste in movies (with the exception of animated Disney movies) is so incredibly different (I like suspense/thrillers and crime dramas whereas he prefers comedies and action movies) but we both ADORE this movie to pieces!

I agree with one particular viewer of this movie, when she or he said that Lindsay Lohen did an amazing job playing both twins and it wad her first movie. She did do an amazing job!
I thought the woman who played Hallie and Annie's father's fiance (who was she, anyway?) was hilaurious, espically when they went camping.

The other actors are of equally high standard, specially Elaine Hendrix as the bride to be and Lisa Ann Walters as the ""butler"" of the father. Lisa Ann Walters outclasses her predecessor in the 1961 movie. Director Nancy Meyers has a keen eye for detail which shows in scenes with some great nonverbal communication, for instance the conversation in the garden between Elaine Hendrix and Lindsay Lohan. Dennis Quaid is very convincing as a father with his legendary broad smile and Natascha Richardson is great as the british mother. Another aspect is the way some ""adult"" items like divorce and seperation are dealt with and yet arevery acceptable for kids. Very moving moments, like the moment Annie reveals her true identity to Chessie (Walters) are pared with hilarious reactions where Chessie shows her affection by offering in the midst of tears to cook something special, while at the same time not degrading the emotional content of that moment. The same goes for Hallie in London. The music is very functional and thanks to VHS a treat to listen to. Visuals are wonderful too.

984825,5,6305177473,"I think this remake of THE PARENT TRAP is a lot better than the original, though the original was pretty good, too. This film is based on the 1961 film by the same title. The movie probably could've found real twins for this, but I guess they wanted to try and make it like the original by getting in one actress to play a double role of the twins. In this version, Hallie Parker and Annie James are the twins and they are played by newcomer, Lindsay Lohan. Dennis Quaid plays Hallie's father, and Natasha Richardson plays Annie's mother.
Hallie and Annie look exactly alike - they are really twins - and they end up meeting each other at a summer camp. Though they look exactly alike, they are completely different. Hallie is from California, and Annie is from England. When they realize that their parents were once married and they are sisters, they decide to switch places (Annie will go home with Hallie's father and Hallie will go home with Annie's mother at the end of camp) and try to get their parents back together before a snobish beauty, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix) marries Hallie's father for his wealth.

I also watched the original movie: what can I say? The 1998 version is light years ahead not for the more advanced computer technology, but the script is simply fantastic. I have read it several times. The acting is so much better that it's hard to describe. Lindsay Lohan is wonderful, enchanting, adorable. Dennis Quaid and the rest of the cast outshine everybody combined in the original release.
It is touching, uplifting. Every time I watch this film, soon I realize, or someone else in my family, that I have a smile on my face. I can't help it. Often it is very deeply emotional, touching our inner most souls, evoking tears in our eyes. The 1960 release never affected me this way, no matter how many times I have seen it.
All in all, I recomend this movie to everybody: young and old, who still can appreciate clean style, good dialogues, action, suspens. Even if the story is predictable, it is immensly enjoyable.

One suggestion to Disney, please please please release the special edition DVD with at least the following feature: (1) the director's/actors' commentary and (2) behind-the-scene footage. I'd love to see how they did the double take with Annie and Hallie in the same frame.
If you have not seen this movie, you're missing out on what probably is the most beautiful movies ever made by Holywood. I hope Holywood will produce more clean good movies like this.",980035200,3,1067,4.4438775510204085

Although they twins are younger then Susan and Sharon, they are much more knowing ( the scenes between Hallie as Annie and Meredith,)- they are kids of the 90's, where divorce affects most children. I love the subtle displays of insecurity, Hallies ""cuppy"" and Annie's small appeitite.  The sound track was perfect, and moving to context with the scenes. ( Here comes the Sun as Hallie, goes to the studio with the Mum she just met.)
I loved Natasha Richardson too, the mother and Nick's girlfreind are successful career woman, Dennis Quaid is great too.  This version makes the original look old fashioned and Haliey Mills seem very stiff and proper.",974505600,,810,4.7785714285714285

This remake of the  1961 Disney comedy about seperated twins which is Lindsay Lohan in a duel  role in the ""Parent Trap of 1998"". The first thing noticable that  makes this movie so terrific is it being so hilarious. The whole movie is  filled with laughter also having beautiful, emotional scenes that just  makes you want to cry. Lindsay Lohan had a tough role but played it  wonderful and the parents Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson also play  sensitive and outstanding parts in the film. The plot is difficult, but  when you find the solution to it, it is one of the most beautiful scenes I  have ever seen. This movie is recommendable to people of all ages.

984875,5,6305177473,"People are outraged that I like the '98 version of THE PARENT TRAP better than the original. Let me briefly explain why:  1) It's more palatable to modern-day standards  (no child slapping, for example)  2) There are  less sub-standard characters in the remake  (the  grandmother was taken out among others)  3) Lindsay  Lohan. You can say what you will about Hayley Mils, but unfortunately  Hayley was playing 2 sisters from different parts of the US, and her  English accent kept bleeding through. Lindsay did an astonishing job not  only playing 2 characters, but playing an American AND English (W/accent  INTACT), and then playing these sisters pretending to be each other  (sort've pulling a Hayley Mills while she was Annie trying to be Hallie and  slipping up!) And it IS a very engaging film! When I first saw the remake,  I DID weep during the scene where the sisters discover their parents and  their situation..  Somebody made the suggestion ""Don't  rent it, buy it! "" I say ""Don't buy it , take up STOCK in it!  You'll want to own the RIGHTS to this movie!""

The movie centers around two young teen-age girls who meet at  summer camp and discover that they are actually twins, sperated at birth!  The girls eagerly switch places, in hopes of getting their divorced parents  back together. Of course, there are complications...great movie that makes  the unbelievable plot, well, believeable, with the great acting and script.  Way worth watching!",963705600,3,620,5.212121212121212
984956,5,6305177473,"Since I first saw the original movie, I have been a diehard fan of The Parent Trap.  When I heard Disney was remaking the film, I thought why mess with a classic.  I must say, though, that this Parent Trap is a classic as  well.  Yes, some things from the original did not survive (such as the  wonderful chemistry between the parents, the entire ""Let's Get  Together"" sequence, and the lovable Reverend Mosby); however, some  aspects were greatly improved upon (the accents, the perfectly evil fiance,  and the relationships between the twins and their butlers).  Most  importantly, the later version maintains the essence of the original story,  that of twin girls scheming to reunite their divorced parents.  Besides  these pluses, the movie is perfectly cast, the music is wonderful, and the  scenery is lovely.
My four-year-old would watch this movie everyday, if I  allowed her too.  It is a great movie for the entire family.  Even though  it is about girls, boys (my husband included) enjoy watching the movie as  much as girls do.  The only bad thing about this movie and the original,  too, is that it gives hope to many divorced children that their parents  will be reunited.  For some children though, they need that hope.
My  advice is to buy this movie as well as the original.  If you can pick a  favorite of the two, you must be a more decisive person than I am.",963532800,,1378,4.661087866108787
984957,5,6305177473,"Being 16 years old, I'm not a big fan of Disney movies any more. But my parents were watching the movie in the family room when I came in to read the newspaper, and I must say I was captivated by the entire movie!
I  remember hearing a few years ago that Disney made a remake of The Parent  Trap. I had seen the original, and I must admit that I thought it would not  be nearly as good as the original. I must also admit that I was wrong.
As  hard as it may be to believe, this is even better than the original!  Lindsay Lohan does a spectacular job portraying both Hallie Parker and  Annie James; and to think this is her first movie! Natasha Richardson and  Dennis Quaid both make wonderful performances as the girls parents. Simon  Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter also do a great job portraying Annie's butler and  Hallie's nanny, respectfully. This was based of the 1961 parent Trap,  starring Hayley Mills, that was written by David Swift. Nancy Meyers and  Charles Shyer wrote the script for the remake and Meyers was director and  Shyer producer. You'll remember the duo from their work with the Father of  the Bride movies. Elaine Hendrix also does a great job playing Meredith,  the evil step-mother-to-be. Ronnie Stevens also does an excellent job  playing Annie's grandfather.
The movie starts out when the girls are sent  to Camp Walden For Girls in Maine. While there, they meet and aren't very  fond of each other. They start playing practical jokes on each other until  the camp directors, Marva Kulp Sr. and Marva Kulp Jr. (played by Polly  Holliday and Maggie Wheeler, respectively) send them to an isolation cabin  for them to spend the rest of the summer there. While there, the girls try  to make the best of things and start to talk to each other. They then begin  to realize that they are amazingly similar to each other. After a while,  they finally realize that they are twins! With each child wanting to meet  their other parent, the girls devise and elaborate plan to switch places,  hoping that when their parents realize they have the wrong child, they will  have to switch them back and see each other after a hiatus of eleven  years.
This movie is highly suggested. I also suggest that you see the  original one, so you can see the similarities and differences between the  two movies. You'll be able to see how the time difference between the two  movies can make them seem much different, even though they have the same  plot. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one!",963446400,17,2501,4.527964205816555
984958,4,6305177473,"I'm glad I have a daughter; a son instead likely would mean this Dad would not have seen this film.
Old enough to recall the original (even if it WAS on television in the 70s, I was 3 when it was in the theatres), my  first reaction when I heard Disney was remaking The Parent Trap was a sense  of, 'Stand back, I Have Digital Technology and I Know How to Use It!'. I  quickly realized the human element still was needed to pull off the use of  one actor in two roles.
Lindsay Lohan's performance missed the mark only  once (no one will believe she's choking on that Oreo with peanut butter)  and she often was brilliant in the awesome task of creating two (four?)  distinct characters. Yet even she, unfortunately, could not pull off the  initial rivalry between the twins well enough to explain why it takes so  long to figure out that they ARE twins.
I blame that on the script and  editing, though, NOT on Lohan. We have a real winner in this one; the  viewer not only forgets the SFX, but each girl's first meeting with the  parent they've never seen before gushes with honest, heart-wrenching  emotion. I had the impression Nancy Meyers directed  Lohan-as-Hallie-pretending-to-be-Annie to knock her 'mum' back onto the  stairs if she could.
(Quick trivia: the producer-director team of  Shyer-Meyers have two daughters. You guessed it: Hallie and Annie. Both  have small roles.)
Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson play the  we-were-rocky-when-we-were-married-and-we're-rocky-now parents to pefection  (though in spots the script has Quaid acting like a real ditz), and Lisa  Ann Walter and Simon Kuntz (""...the help!"") steal each scene  they're in (""Chessy? Why are you looking at her like that?""). A  viewer actually can care for the characters and their development and  that's vital to any film. Even Elaine Hendrix (Meredith) injects life into  a character meant to be one-dimensional.
If you can buy the admittedly  unspeakable premise of splitting twins at birth and never telling them, and  sit through two hours, and you're NOT a pre-teen boy, you'll like The  Parent Trap 1998.",963014400,,2093,4.888888888888889

Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson play  Annie and Hallie's divorced parents (Nick and Liz) who still have feelings  for each other. Elaine Hendrix plays the role of Nick's fiancee (evil  Meredith Blake). Ronnie Stevens (Grandfather), Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy) and  Simon Kunz (Martin) lovingly help the twins with their plan to get their  parents back together. This remake of The Parent Trap is way better than  the original. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson (Nick and Liz) are more  romantic than the couple in the original Parent Trap. You can see the  sparks in Nick and Elizabeth's eyes. Quaid and Richardson make a really  cute/nice couple in this movie. Simon Kunz is definitely the best  supporting actor and Lisa Ann Walter is definitely the best supporting  actress in the world; they are so cute together in this movie, too. I  seriously can't watch enough of The Parent Trap (1998). I've watched it  more than 100 times.

Although I love Brian Keith, I still think Dennis Quaid was  a great cast as the father of the separated twins who come together at a  summer camp. The movie is full of subtle in jokes, such as one daughter  named Hallie (Hayley Mills played the original twin), and the twins  whistling ""lets Get Together"" every once in awhile, which of  course Mills made famous as a song from the original movie! The mother,  Natasha Richardson is also well cast, almost reminding me of the goofy Meg  Ryan in roles such as You've Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle! I think that  this version has more tender and sincere moments than the original, while  side stepping the sappiness that sometimes pervades Disney outings!

The plot is pretty much the same as the  original Parent Trap but is a little different.  If you haven't seen it yet  you definitely should, especially if you're looking for a good laugh.

The other actors are of equally high standard, specially Elaine Hendrix as  the bride to be and Lisa Ann Walters as the ""butler"" of the  father. Lisa Ann Walters outclasses her predecessor in the 1961 movie.  Director Nancy Meyers has a keen eye for detail which shows in scenes with  some great nonverbal communication, for instance the conversation in the  garden between Elaine Hendrix and Lindsay Lohan. Dennis Quaid is very  convincing as a father with his legendary broad smile. Another aspect is  the way some ""adult"" items like divorce and seperation are dealt  with and yet arevery acceptable for kids. Very moving moments, like the  moment Annie reveals her true identity to Chessie (Walters) are pared with  hilarious reactions where Chessie shows her affection by offering in the  midst of tears to cook something special, while at the same time not  degrading the emotional content of that moment. The same goes for Hallie in  London. The music is very functional and thanks to DVD a treat to listen  to. Visuals are wonderful too.

Also, this  movie was a big hit of 1998 and even grossed more than many major movies,  such as ""A Perfect Murder"".

I went to the cinema to watch the ""updated"" version, not expecting much, as I'd already seen the remake of ""That Darn Cat"" (disappointing,  although the original was hilarious!). But, this one was BRILLIANT! Lindsay  Lohan was great, so was Dennis Quaid, Chessie (?) and Martin, but the best  was Natasha Richardson, especially with the drunk scene and all her British  comedy-like lines!",931910400,,447,4.92

Everyone in the movie seems to be  ""acting"" with a great deal of strain.  Dennis Quaid can't seem to  get the vacant look off of his face. Everyone is just so perfect--forced  perfection. If you want to really appreciate the Parent Trap, go for the  original.",931305600,6,433,4.558441558441558

Technical improvements and a better cast make this  film superior than the original.  Throw in the wacky nanny and butler and  you have a real classic.  So seldom do remakes do the original film  justice; this is one that does.  And is there a more beautiful gal than Ms.  Richardson? I think not.  So, you macho guys out there, rent this movie for  you and your favorite girl to watch.  She will finally think that you might  have at least one romantic bone in your body! ;^)",928713600,,642,4.285714285714286

What I was hoping for was things like, cut off script, director  commentary(sorry,i know my spelling is bad), and such like, just like what  they made in LD. However, the DVD version of Parent Trap was really worth  buying, the digital effect and stuff like that is Fab!!

Then I made my mom rent Parent Trap . I watched 4 times in the past three  days and hope to buy it soon . It is prefectly marvelous !

There were a few scenes where I had to choke  back tears! If there was one fault the movie had, it was its unrealistic  treatment of just how ravaging divorce and separation actually is in real  life.  Both daughters had only warm, fuzzy feelings about the parent they  never knew -- never dealing with or acknowledging any feelings of  abandonment or rejection. But the daughters' creative scheme to reunite  their parents was admirable and pulled off with much passion and dignity.  This was a well-updated remake of the classic, and I liked it much better  than the original. We're planning to buy it for our home collection.",914544000,,802,4.781021897810219

7884220,5,6305177473,"A movie that is a remake of an original is truly a hit or miss. The Parent Trap (1998) is an updated version of a classic with a relatable plotline to everyone. It tells the journey of two identical twins being separated at birth after their parents' divorce, and how they found their way back together to become one big happy family again.
Ever since I was a little girl I have loved this movie. I have attended a summer camp all of my life and that is where I feel I make a personal connection with this movie. The plot of this movie alone is exciting because of all of the plot twists it incorporates into it. It is a happy movie but a slight tear-erker at times, which is why I feel I refer back to it so often, it has an emotional connection to almost anyone.
There are a few different aspects of this movie that make it interesting. The first being the acting of this movie. Two of the main characters in this movie are played by Lindsay Lohan, just like in the original Parent Trap which was played by Hayley Mills, Lohan was younger than Mills having incredible maturity and grace balancing the two different personalities of each of the girls.
Secondly, another aspect of this movie that made the quality standout was the amount of detail put into it to bring this movie to life. From the vineyards of Napa, California to the streets of England. Nights at summer camp to the wedding dresses displayed at Haley and Annie's mother bridal shop. The detail that went into creating this movie really stood out throughout the entire thing.
Another quality of this movie that is important is the music used throughout the whole movie. Instead of using hit songs of that time The Parent Trap incorporated classics with some newer music to create the perfect settings throughout the movie that also grabs your attention in each scene.
Overall, The Parent Trap will always be a classic movie for many reasons. From the talented actors chosen to play each part. To the soundtrack and the setting of the movie, so much detail, time, and effort was put into the production of it and it truly shows throughout the movie.",1523232000,,2115,4.5248041775456915
