5198361,4,B008ZRKIQ6,"Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End is just that, a beginning of at the very least a two-part movie series from Pure Flix Entertainment.  The viewer gets the opportunity to meet Josh, a traveling salesman with a secret but obviously destructive past.  You can see early on that Josh has the capability to go a little unhinged when necessary but you can also see that this is not a side of himself that he entertains.  We also meet a pretty rough biker gang who have a charismatic leader named Hawg.  The gang has no problem with messing with people, stealing and eliminating witnesses, but they do have a problem with Joshua when he gets in their way.

You can tell Joshua has a past, but it changed dramatically when he met his wife.  Or at least that is what Josh thought until he sees how easy it really is to slip back into his old skill set.  Can a person really change?  If tackling that question isn't enough for Josh, it seems there are a lot of energy spikes, thunder storms and other natural phenomenon taking place to keep him on his toes and at the very least distracted.  As the description implies, there is an end coming.

Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End is a great start.  I found myself wishing for more which is a good thing since there is a sequel on the way (yay!).  I have found myself enjoying most of the films that Pure Flix Entertainment has put out, and look forward to seeing where this will go.  I hope I don't have to wait too long.

For the most part the film was well acted and I felt a connection with several of the characters.  I even got emotional at some points too.  I love when a film can accomplish that.",1363392000,59,1659,4.320388349514563

5198423,3,B008ZRKIQ6,"""Revelation Road"" is a Christian-based recruiting film for the unsaved. It depicts one man's journey from amoral government killing machine to acolyte of Jesus. The story is stripped down to simple basics and is somewhat ham-handed in the method by which it delivers its message, as many such movies are. It's as if they're so eager to spread The Word they get ahead of themselves. Special effects are clumsy, acting is mediocre to poor (except for a surprisingly rich performance by former NFL great Brian Bosworth) and writing is at times like fingernails on a chalk board. Still, it's an ambitious movie (it and its sequel, which I watched back to back). I'm not much on being proselytized but ""Revelation Road"" was entertaining enough. I would add it's surprisingly violent, with lots of shootings, beatings and whatnot. Maybe not suitable for vacation Bible school.",1464652800,,870,5.048611111111111
5198424,4,B008ZRKIQ6,"I received this DVD from FishFlix for the purpose of this review. All comments and opinions are entirely my own.

The beginning of the end will drop you to your knees in prayer or cause chaos unimaginable.

In Revelation Road;  The Beginning of the End is the first movie in the Revelation Road series made by PureFlix. It's a very docile depiction of the book of Revelation with it only being rated PG and focused mostly on Josh's interaction with the biker gang rather than what is Biblically going to happen. Many may want to compare this film to the hits Left Behind, but the two are very different in many ways.

Biblically, there may be some debate about whether or not this is an accurate account of Revelation, mainly concerning whether or not there will be a second chance for those left after the ""rapture"". But that depends on personal interpretations of the Bible and I suppose that really no one will know until after it happens.

As for the content, it was very clean, absolutely no cussing and no sexual scenes/comments/intentions. The only things that may keep this at an older audience is the action. It's not detailed, in fact it doesn't show any blood anywhere, but it does show the moments before someone dies (for example, the opening scene is the biker leader on his bike chasing a man who is running, he kills the man by swinging a ridiculously large hammer as he passes the man. The scene cuts out just before the hammer meets the man's body, saving us from the image, but knowing what just happened creates enough suspense on its own).

Overall, this is an entertaining movie and it's clean action is welcoming during these days of having a hard time finding a clean movie. I recommend it to ages 12+, because though it is only rated PG, the action is very well-done. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

This is one that captures my interest to watch again and again. The characters,  the actor playing Jesus,  and the vision of what this period might be like. Either I have just been finding more recently,  or there's an uptick in the making of these end times films. Bottom line,  it is an excellent film in its genre.

Honestly my family, esp my husband usually poopoo on Christian movies they think they are often cheesy. But on Easter 2014 -6 of us sat and watched one after another 1,2 ,3. We had so much fun we were so excited and searched for the #4 but not yet to be found. i find myself showing it to friends, telling others and looking often for a hope of the sequel. This is a must watch for everyone. Definately very insightful to the end of days. Its pretty close to the scriptures the details are a story line but who knows it could be even more real then we know. I found nothing opposing what I believe.  It will move people to check their hearts and make sure they are ready for heaven. I believe it to be a great tool of the Lord. Show it to everyone you know . Saved and unsaved.

5198497,5,B008ZRKIQ6,"Is Brian Bosworth a former Football Player for the Settle Seahawks? What my husband says. Good movie, saw a few times before and bought a few copies to give to our friends and family. There are three Revelation Road (this is the first one); I like Revelation Road and Revelation Road 2 but not so much for Revelation Road 3 since the girl in black stockings looked too sensuous for me. I get what the writer or producer was trying to do in this movie: As told in Revelation 6:5 ""I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand..."" However,
Revelation 6:4 ""Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other"" And, Revelation 6:8 ""I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth"" When put in a Theater Movie without fake creatures (like the ""Watchers"" in ""Noah"" the theater movie ) should make a GOOD MOVIE. Perhaps, someday Pureflix Studios, will have enough in their budget to make a movie with these chapters. Keeping  sensuous out, and focusing on the violence. Revelation 9: 3 ""And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth."" Revelation 9:5 ""They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.""

I seen that Brian ""Boz"" Bosworth was in it and thought hell, that feller played a pretty good Russkie in Rocky 4 so he might be pretty good in this.  Right off the bat I notice the ""Boz"" looked different but ya know it's been around 30 years so anyways. I than noticed this movie's production was like one of them SyFy movies. Lord help us from another Sharknado!  They also keep referencing the good Lord in it. Right aways I start slowing down on the 'shine and start wondering if it's a Churchey movie. Nothing worse than being preached at while drinking. Well the story is not that bad. The acting is though. The F/X are ginchey.  You can tell that the main dude Josh has some issues with his past. I thought it'd be like Rambo and it was something military/spec. ops related. They don't go into much detail but Josh can kick some ass when he has to. The Sons of the Apocalypse MC was pretty much a joke. Except for Boz. He made up for the rest. What kind of MC has a chick as a part of the crew and not just an Old Lady? Anywho it gets wickeder at the end and some of the folks in it ""get called up to Heaven"" and such. Just once I wanted to hear Boz say ""I will break you"" like he did in Rocky 4 but none of that. Some good lookin chicks in this movie also. Always something good to look at makes a bad movie easier to watch. Wish John Waters would have known that back in the day.

Anyone who thinks these movies will be lame because they are Christian movies would be very badly mistaken.

5198571,5,B008ZRKIQ6,"I love this movie! I will have to agree with several other reviewers, the movie is NOT for kids under 13. Revelation Road has a lot of twisted scenes, and by that I mean violence. In my opinion I felt like the violent scenes were to give the viewer a more realistic view of the mayhem that exist in todays society and to also show us that after the RAPTURE it will only get much worse.

The story is VERY amazing! A guy is on his way home to see his wife and little girl, he is a non believer and doesn't like it when his wife brings up God in a conversation. The guy has a very bad dealing with a motorcycle gang that wants him dead. The movie is about this guy discovering God and her purposes and also discovering himself. His way of life is changed because of the RAPTURE and his new relationships with the people he just met.",1411344000,,830,4.0920245398773005

I have never seen it depicted this way before in any other movie and this is how I would envision this to be.

5198595,5,B008ZRKIQ6,"Just happened across Relevation Road and was hooked by this film.  Incredibly engaging actioner about a man without faith, a mysterious past, and the ability to give out beat downs that is unparalled, fighting his way out of a post apocolyptic (day of judgment) type landcape against a ruthless biker gang (led by an excellent Brian Bosworth- very solid acting and menace from him).  There is tremendous conflict in the the main characters, and it makes this a really great film.  This is the second faith based film after ""Courageous"" that I found myself enjoying greatly.

A lot of imagery and symbolism about complete loss of faith, redemption, facing your demons, but I did not in the overall find it overly preachy, just provoking and really engaging.  Revelation Road has a real hypnotic quality to it, and it sets itself up as part 1 in what should be an epic post apocalyptic series of action films.

I give it 5 stars because it is very unique, and I highly recommend it to people with and without faith for an intersting take on this subject.",1392336000,,1052,4.690217391304348

5198605,4,B008ZRKIQ6,"I watched this film because my dad recommended it. My dad has NEVER been one to watch Christian movies, in fact, I think this is the only one he's seen with the exception of Fireproof which I gave him. Nevertheless, my dad is a very hard man and for him to say that it really impacted him says a lot. For those who say this movie would not touch an unbeliever, I strongly disagree. I'm not even 100% sure where my dad is spiritually, but like I said, he was greatly moved by the film.

I have been a believer for 9 years, and contrary to other believers who have trashed this movie, I thought it was very well done. Sure the writing isn't Oscar worthy, but the message is profound. There are a lot of gaps, but it's for a reason because there is a sequel. The acting was not bad and again, it's all about the message.

I found the rapture scene extremely powerful and I wept as soon as I knew what was happening. The scene is amazing and touching. I cried throughout knowing that this will happen, whether people believe or not. I've seen the Left Behind movies and they were good too, but I have yet to see a film to capture that event when Jesus returns.

Very enjoyable movie and it left me wanting more. Will rent the second part on Amazon since they offer it. Please keep the Christian movies coming. As the end draws near and the world spins more and more out of control, unbelievers and believers alike will search for something solid and hopefully will want to read the Bible to know the Truth.

5198608,4,B008ZRKIQ6,"First off, I'd like to mention that a part of me was hesitant on seeing this film because of the last film from Pure|Flix I saw, Saving Winston, which ended up being a Christian movie full of Christian tropes and cliches that bored me. Not only that, I'd noticed people on amazon.com hated this movie because of its violence (makes me wonder how they'd react to Jesus when He comes back in full Terminator mode like He's described in the Book of Revelations?)
 (Possible spoilers ahead)
 Josh is a travelling salesman on his way back to his wife and daughter and on the phone with her when two strange things happen. One is a bizarre lightning storm. Just lightning. Constant. The other, as he's pulled over when his car dies down, is some guy bumping into his car, then yells at him as if he was the one that ruined his truck. As Josh points out the error of what the guy's saying, things just about get out of control when a bike gang (who, in the initial scene, have already beaten up a federal agent and the leader says something really insightful on how backwards the world is when it comes to who's to fear and who's not) comes by. After the nonviolent skirmish, the bike gang goes off.
 Josh goes into a convenience store to try another try at selling what he's selling. Then comes straightforward questions from the man he's trying to sell to. Not long after, the salesman who's ""not on speaking terms"" with God protects the store's owner and his granddaughter from 3 of the bike gang. From there, things get intense. And not just the constant lightning storm from nowhere, either.
 Normally, when it comes to indie-made Christian flicks, I'd get really hesitant on trying them out because of the tendency to have little variety. It was only because the people expressed disdain because of the violence that I decided to try it out. Now I'm glad.
 You have a trouble-making biker gang, straightforward talk about Jesus (luckily, nothing too cheesy for me to handle and it definitely hit home on a couple points about God's character), and the biker gang is as hardcore as they come (of course, there's no swearing, and in only one instance did the swearless talk come off as slightly cheesy) with their leather getups and crazy helmets. And it turns out the leader has a somewhat ambiguous relationship with one of the women (not sexual, it's hinted they're related, like father-daughter, but his crude talk shows disgust toward her).
 So, basically, the bikers represent how the world is toward Christians, and accurately as well.
 The violence is what would make this film PG-13 if it were rated (that and one woman mentioning that she's a drug junkie). A couple shootouts, blood mists sprays, but certainly nothing as extreme as, say, The Book of Eli (there was no dismemberment, full-framed headshots, decapitations, bloody arrow shots, etc. in this movie), but when vioelence happens, it's immediately clear what's going on.
 And some of the violence is contextually clear as protecting one's family.
 There are people who've shown how legalistic they are on terms with the objectionable content of this film, but I guess they miss the overall picture with an erroneous reading of the Bible.
 There are moments when Josh has clear struggles with who he is (though it's never fully explained what his past was like, that's going to be shown in the sequel), and when one woman mocks him and asks ""What? You found Jesus?"" when he explains that he's not who he was, he says a stunner for him and explains about his wife. And the way he talks about her, it's blatantly clear how much he loves her and is not willing to compromise for anything. In that one scene, the woman throws out realistic questions that one really normally wouldn't hear in the world about how nothing in the world can change who someone really is, no matter what. After a brief fight with the woman's friend (couldn't tell if he was her boyfriend or client consider how she hints about herself), he begins to realize something about himself and, while on the phone with his wife, something weird happens.
 I won't get into what happens, but if you've seen all the other End Times movies, you can figure it out easily.
 When the store owner's granddaughter manages to escape from the clutches of the biker gang, she runs into an unexpected character (if you've seen The Encounter, you'll recognize him), and he performs one crazy miracle for her to let her know who he is.
 If there was anything that did annoy me about this film, it would be the lighting effects from the constant lightning strikes, for they were overprocessed to the point of being obviously fake. Some of the script tended to go overboard (though not much) that showed it wasn't a major production.
 Ocassionally, some stylized shots just seemed to come out nowhere. Most of them helped out with the stylizing of the action, but others simply seemed pointless.
 Beyond these technical reasonings, I actually enjoyed this movie quite well.
 Now to wait for the sequel.",1377043200,,5017,4.716571428571428

5198623,2,B008ZRKIQ6,"The message of the Gospel is clear and that is sure, but it is made as an appeal to the heart and completely subjective.  It is presented as blind faith with no clear scripture given.  I doubt this movie will ever touch the hearts of the unsaved.  What's worse is the false presentation of a gnostic amillennial platonic escapist pretribulation.

If you believe as Plato did that the goal is to escape the body and float as pure spirit in the heavens in some sort of fog or incorporeal state then this is the movie for you!

None of that compares with a horribly watered down gospel message. No repentance. No blood. You canNOT have a relationship with The Lord Jesus Christ without those two components. It simply cannot be done. And then to leave it with a 'To Be Continued' at the end was just unthinkably poor taste.

I'd give this a pathetic when comparing to Fireproof, Courageous, and Amazing Love. There are a couple of fight scenes that are pretty well choreographed, but the pointless brutality of some of the more voilent scenes are just plain stupid and pathetically ghorry. The story is pretty pointless and ending is worse. No closure, ending to the story, lots of loose ends, oh ""to be continued"".

This is rather a pop Christian version designed to sell a film to those who never read and studied the book.

Josh (=Jesus) sells vests (=armor of God). He saves a family from a group of evil bikers known as either Outlaws or Barbarians. They have their own heavy metal swagger music, kill people, but never swear. Oh yes, they have something that looks like Thor's hammer. Eric Roberts has a small role in this film. Bruce Marchiano who always plays Jesus in these productions plays a stranger who saves a girl from said bikers. Please Scooby-Doo, tell me who this guy is?

This is just the first part of what will surely be a butchered series designed to soak churches for the rights to showing this film. PLOT SPOILER...if there is such a thing...the rapture happens at the end of the film. While the rapture has statements to support it in the Bible, it really isn't part of Revelation. Technically this is a movie about the end times that doesn't follow Revelation in any shape or form, but simply uses it in the title to sell the feature. Dishonest if you ask me.

Outside of that, the movie was poorly acted and the dialogue was jerky, like the sign reads, ""Guns, Jerky, and More.""

I was very disappointed that I didn't know it came in two parts and the 2nd part hasn't been released yet. Why??? Who wants to start something and not be able to finish it?",1366243200,,251,3.9411764705882355

5198652,5,B008ZRKIQ6,"I pretty much love all Pure Flix movies, and not to mention ones featuring David White and his wife Andrea. A great film in general and not filled with trash like what most is out there on film and TV. The end of the world movies have been around for awhile, more so in recent years... Whether it's a christian film or not guess to most can get old pretty much watching the same thing over and over again.

What's great about Revelation Road is the storyline to it, and how it happen a fresh look and style to it.. At least from what I have seen which been so many I have lost count. With Revelation Road makes it more real like you are actually living it and not watching a movie. When the rapture this are some of the things that will happen to the people.... To the people that most movies have not shown before (Again from what I have not seen). Also a new way also of what happens to the believers when the rapture happens.",1366070400,,928,4.155555555555556
5198653,1,B008ZRKIQ6,"This movie was a little slow with a common theme: strangers meet in a desert setting and a tough gang of bikers threatens everyone especially a lone salesman.  The salesman turns out to be an ex-military man with a crisis of conscience.  So far, so good! I like the production values, excellent acting---I actually bought the video because I enjoy watching Ray Wise and Eric Roberts on screen.  The language is acceptable and literate BUT the movie just stops and ""TO BE CONTINUED ON REVELATION 2"" pops up on the last frame.  What a ripoff!  I can appreciate a sequel.  I like sequels but every viewer expects the movie he just spent 86 min. watching to come to a conclusion even if he might not agree with it!  How could a director just quit; I've seen many television shows do this BUT NEVER A MOVIE!  Out of common courtesy, the case should have indicated this movie was unfinished.  BUT then I would not have purchased the movie.  I'm very disappointed with PUREFLIX and will probably never buy another of their movies for fear that it, too, will not have an ending.",1366070400,2,1070,4.554973821989528
5198654,3,B008ZRKIQ6,"If you are a lover of the left behind series then this movie is right up your alley, it has nothing to do with scripture, you will not find anything here that the apostle John wrote about in Revelations. To much violence and gore. I believe that this movie would evn turn off those that believe in the rapture, as only about ten people get raptured at the end, sorry but thats the way i viewed this movie, great for wrestling fans also...",1365811200,,438,4.289156626506024
5198655,5,B008ZRKIQ6,Good christian movie and anything with david ar white in it is good stuff.  Really hard to find anything clean now days that is entertaining. will watch this one a few times. Was pleasantly surprised to find out there will be a sequel so im definatly excited to see what happens =)) Would definatly reccomend this one!,1365638400,,318,4.578947368421052
5198656,1,B008ZRKIQ6,"There obviously is a big market for Christian ""End Times"" schlock like this. There are many people who desperately WANT to believe that the Apocalypse is at hand, so they will eagerly fork over money to have their hopes confirmed, if only in the comfort of their own living rooms. So what if it was made on a bare-bones budget? So what if the special effects and acting and scripts are all absolutely dreadful? It's a CHRISTIAN film, and that's the only excuse they need. Problem is, by wasting time on mumbo-jumbo like this, they're missing out on so many more wonderful, enriching movies. It makes me very sad.",1365638400,2,612,4.623853211009174

5198658,5,B008ZRKIQ6,"Okay - this is a low budget film but it is a very good low budget film. Is it worth your time to watch? Absolutely! No doubt about it. Especially if you like biblical films.  Although not the main character in the movie Noell Coet's role (Noell is a rapidly emerging actor destined for the ""A List"") was still substantial and she, along with Ray Weiss (a superb veteran actor), stood out for their exceptional acting in this film. Kudos and two thumbs up to both of them.",1364342400,,471,4.3522727272727275

8533081,3,B008ZRKIQ6,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by Gabriel Sabloff, ""Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End"" stars David A.R. White as a traveling salesman in the deserts of the Southwest  with a dark past, who just wants to get home to his wife (Jen Lilley) and daughter.  But his plans are disturbed by a crazy outlaw biker gang and a wise gun store owner (Ray Wise), his granddaughter (Noell Coet) and wife (Eliza Roberts), not to mention the foreboding lightning and tremors. Brian Bosworth plays the head thug while Eric Roberts appears as the sheriff. The striking Andrea Logan White is also on hand as one of the gang members.

This film and its immediate sequel, Revelation Road 2: The Sea of Glass and Fire, were shot back-to-back and released four months apart in 2013. Revelation Road: The Black Rider (2014) completes the trilogy. I have yet to see the two sequels, but the fact that this movie is the beginning of a trilogy should be kept in mind in appraising it. In other words, it's a foundation for a greater work and not a stand-alone film.

If you're familiar with Christian productions from the new millennium, like Left Behind: The Movie (2000), Deceived (2002), Fireproof (2008), Cutback (2010), I Am (2010), Abels Field (2012), Do You Believe? (2015), War Room (2015) and God is Not Dead 2 (2016), this film is cut from a different cloth (of course, you could say the same for Deceived and I Am).

Imagine if Tarantino made an oddball evangelical flick on a low-budget; thats what this movies like. The outlaw bikers are depicted better than in most of those dubious biker flicks from the late 60s and early 70s while the action is so over-the-top its almost cartoony, but not really if you consider the Las Vegas massacre and similar insane public bloodbaths. Theres a meandering, almost unfocused vibe to the proceedings, which can be defended on the grounds that it reflects the meaningless of life. Regardless, the limited-budget filmmaking is competent enough and the actors are stalwart and convincing.

Theres a killer ultra-heavy cut on the soundtrack that appears during the prologue and later in the movie, as well as a great modern rock song during the end credits. Theres also a couple of moving mellow songs by Serena Matthews, one during the final credits (after the rock song).

THE FILM RUNS 88 minutes and was shot in the deserts of the American Southwest (I cant find info on the exact locations). WRITERS: Sean Paul Murphy & Sabloff.
