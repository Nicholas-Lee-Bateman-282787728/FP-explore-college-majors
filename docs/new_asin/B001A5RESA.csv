8276205,5,B001A5RESA,"This two-disc set is for you if you like Jarrett's trio offerings.  I believe disc 1 was originally published back in 1976 and has been out of print or pricey and hard to find since that time.  However, this two disc set includes this original performance plus an additional full concert done at a later date (the second disc is not just a bunch of out-takes).  Both discs appear to have been recorded in the same concert hall--Tokyo I think.

I will not get into all the justly-deserved praise given this trio; you can read that from previous reviews.  I'll just say that this music is superb!

So then why am I writing this review?  Three reasons: (1) sound quality, (2) video quality, and, (3) general production quality.

(1)  Sound quality is fantastic.  ECM did their usual great job of miking everyone perfectly.  All players seem to have their own space audio-wise and yet the whole thing comes together with a ""you are there"" quality.  The instruments are in complete sonic balance.  That typically beautiful Jarrett piano is there with bells on!  I love that treble of the big Steinway.  On my 7.1 system I feel like I'm in the front row.

(2)  The video quality is a bit grainy and cloudy--the second disc is a bit clearer than the first disc.  Not a big thing, but it still seems like the video rendering could have been a bit clearer.  Possibly the darken concert hall is to blame for this.  I add that this grainy view tends to appear only on full stage screen shots of the trio.  Lighting is good and the grain sort of disappears in close-ups of the players.

(3)  General production is great.  Video shots of each player are abundant as are overviews of the full trio spread out on the stage.  You get numerous shots of Jarrett's hands, DeJonnett's (huge) drum kit, and Peacock's finger board.

This video seems to enhance the subtle swing inherent in the trio's CD playing.  The video + audio cues come together in a synergistic manner to add something to the swing that seems to be absent in the trio's CD playing.  I love it when each of the players smiles and nods at the other based on something just played.  All these fine points are captured here.

These discs deserve to be played on a good TV and audio system and will bring out the best of a high-end rig.  And you will probably listen to them numerous times and then some.  Just add a bottle of wine and sit back.  You are at the Jarrett Superbowl in your own home!  We have all seen poorly-produced music DVD performances that were never intended to be played on DVD due to poor sound, poor video, etc.  This Jarrett set is not one of these; it's done right and can be a reference DVD if you want to show off your system to neighbors.

Sidebar:  Two-channel stereo vs 7.1 surround?  I've heard many CDs in 5.1 and in 7.1 surround.  The surround effect simply didn't come off in my opinion relative to a good two-channel presentation.  Perhaps it was the artificial mixing of an original stereo recording to make it into a 5.1 or 7.1 surround presentation.  Surprisingly this Jarrett DVD collection does not suffer from any type of manipulated sound engineering, probably because there is no need to tweak things.  I do not know if this was originally a stereo recording or how much mixing went on post-concert.  I just know that my 7.1 multi-channel presentation gives a truly comfortable and balanced rendering which is probably due to my setting the system to the multi-channel setting.  The multi-channel on my system sucks for such DVDs as Avatar and the like where specific sounds are targeted for specific speakers.

A highly-recommended two + hours of music.",1432425600,3,3644,4.5813953488372094
