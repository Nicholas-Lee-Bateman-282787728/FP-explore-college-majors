6290860,5,B00ISS7S4W,I've been wanting to get the a collection like this because its a little less expensive than buying them seperately. Anyways these are great movies to watch. If you've seen either the first or the second film I'm sure you'll enjoy the third aswell. Hope you enjoy.,1404432000,2,264,4.638297872340425
6290861,3,B00ISS7S4W,"MK1 & MK2 are brilliant on Blu-ray but Legacy is less of a movie and more a collection of short stories about the charcters origins. Legacy also has end credits that roll after every ""short story"". If you can deal with these interruptions then yea go ahead and get it. I will say that the stories in Legacy are pretty good and some of the 3D shots and animation are really awesome.",1402531200,,381,4.305555555555555

6290871,5,B00ISS7S4W,Great combo pack especially for Blu Ray! I recommend this to anyone if you're into the MK movies. The Legacy series would have been fantastic as an addition but as is it is great fun to watch.,1443657600,,192,4.216216216216216
6290872,5,B00ISS7S4W,"awesome movie love it I highly recommend it if your wondering 100%
Mortal Kombat 1,2 and Mortal Kombat legacy",1443139200,5,109,4.7894736842105265
6290873,2,B00ISS7S4W,"First of all this review is going to be solely about the product I was sold rather than the actual movies/web series considering I already saw them and wouldn't be buying this product if I didn't like them. Now for my review of the product I will say I was fairly disappointed I received the package and opened it to find that it didn't look exactly like the pictures (the back cover wasn't the same at all). Then I open the case to find out to my surprise that the case is only meant to hold two discs when they have three disc inside. I don't know how most people feel but I personally feel that for one thing the product I buy better match its postings pictures and that it should obviously come in a case that holds all of its components in place.
Very Unprofessional and I will say I am very unsatisfied.",1440547200,2,809,4.225806451612903
6290874,5,B00ISS7S4W,"This movie is great to watch with younger or older people. It's a must have for Mortal Combat fans. Arrived in good shape ,and  on time. A 5 star seller. Thank you.",1438905600,,164,4.125
6290875,5,B00ISS7S4W,the two of three are great.,1431561600,,27,3.6666666666666665
6290876,4,B00ISS7S4W,this score is based solely from fandom the movies are nostalgic for me (the first 2 at least) otherwise you're not missing much by skiping this one but product it self works as expected,1431388800,,185,4.470588235294118
6290877,5,B00ISS7S4W,"While I really enjoy all 3 movies, I REALLY enjoyed the MK Legacy disc. I know this is just a disc of videos I could watch on YouTube, but having them compiled into a small series to watch back to back like a movie makes a difference.",1428969600,4,234,4.0
6290878,1,B00ISS7S4W,The only movie that was in the case was Mortal Combat Legacy. I bought it for my son's birthday and he's very upset that the other movies aren't in the package.,1425859200,,160,4.193548387096774
6290879,5,B00ISS7S4W,Great item,1424563200,,10,4.5
6290880,3,B00ISS7S4W,Mortal Combat 1 & 2 I enjoyed but Mortal Combat 3 was a bad joke.  I was expecting a full length move and instead got about a dozen featurettes about 10 minutes each introducing characters and then leaving you hanging.  What a disappointment.,1424044800,,242,4.604651162790698
6290881,5,B00ISS7S4W,"Okay, let's be honest - these movies are terrible, but Mortal Kombat is awesome. ""Annihilation"" is objectively worse than the first movie, but I believe it's still perfectly watchable. I have yet to watch ""Legacy"" but I hear it's really good. Honestly, I bought this specifically for the first two movies, because I remember enjoying them as a child, and I was getting hyped up for the upcoming Mortal Kombat X. This is a good package of three discs with a slip cover. Not the classiest looking case to put on your movie shelf, but you aren't buying this collection because you're classy - you're buying it because you're awesome and like cheesy action movies. ""Legacy"" has a sequel that I wish would be included, but perhaps a new version of this collection will be released in the future.",1423699200,12,790,4.690647482014389

8645088,5,B00ISS7S4W,"1st off it always bother me when people buy a movie & then review the movie here. This isn't a movie review section. This a product review. If you bought the movie and hated it, that's your fault. You should know what your getting yourself into before you pay for it. Now for my review. It's a good cheap set. If you want Mortal Kombat 1 & 2 on Blu-ray together, than this is your option. It says triple feature but Legacy is a bunch of short webisodes. 8 to 12 minutes per. Complete with end credits for every one. It's hard to get through. Mortal Kombat Annihilation has absolutely no special features except for the trailer to that film. Mortal Kombat the first one has almost no features. It has the trailer & then has a 39 minute animated movie called Mortal Kombat Begins. If you like Mortal Kombat, you might like it. I can't speak for whether or not these movies bought individually would have features, but I am a collector of box sets & collections & I find often that many sets don't have any special features with exception of the 1st or possibly the last film if it's relatively new. So I didn't expect much of this set. As far as picture quality? If you have the DVD, you basically have the Blu-ray. All this Blu-ray seems to be is the DVD put onto a Blu-ray disc.",1519776000,,1278,4.3070539419087135
8645089,5,B00ISS7S4W,Very good value for money - You get three movies and the quality of the video and audio is very good.,1517270400,,101,3.857142857142857
8645090,4,B00ISS7S4W,"The movies will always hold a special ""so bad it's good"" place in my heart. The first season of the web series is super good too and a nice plus for this. I just wish the special features were more than just some trailers.",1512000000,,222,4.068181818181818
