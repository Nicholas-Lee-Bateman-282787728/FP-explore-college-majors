This set contains four movies that were adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles Sherlock Holmes stories. They have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. The first three movies used parts from the original stories and adapted them to modern times. The last and best known follows the original story (but omits the character of Laura Lyons). They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading, especially when you are older. Read the individual reviews on each movie for more information.
