5717078,4,B00CDWQNZ4,"This is an excellent made for TV film about how the underground railroad actually worked.  The film centers on Sarah (Janet Bailey) a house slave who has it the easiest in the group. A Canadian abolitionist on his first trip to the south manages to convince a group of slaves to make the trek to Canada.

Along the way they encounter Harriet Tubman as well as a pair of  black and white bounty hunters which reminded me  of ""Django."" The film is less intense and graphic than ""12 Years a Slave.""  A little grand on the speeches and light on some of the acting, as expected for a TV film.",1388793600,23,587,4.3
5717079,5,B00CDWQNZ4,"I teacher 8th graders and we watched this on a recommendation from another teacher in my district.  I'm always hesitant to watch longer movies with limited class time, but this one was well worth it.  I think it gave the kids a very real perspective of the challenges of the Underground Railroad and what slaves both faced and risked.  Keep in mind that there is some less than acceptable language and ways of treating others based on the time period, but it was nothing I found inappropriate and it wasn't over the top in any way - merely reflective of that reality.  I found it to be worth the class time and my students had positive things to say about it afterwards, which to me, is the biggest indicator of it being a good movie to show.",1388620800,52,742,4.394160583941606

5717082,5,B00CDWQNZ4,"Great movie and perfect for whole family. Acting and plot is well done and story is moving.

5717090,5,B00CDWQNZ4,A great movie to help children understand the subject. There was one scene where they break the feet of a slave for running away (they don't show the actually breaking but it's clear what's going on) that was a bit intense for my 8 year old but I think it's important for children to understand what they went through then.,1485475200,,323,4.4

5717217,5,B00CDWQNZ4,I watched it on you tube to see if it was worth buying and great for when I start teaching my students about slavery. I also wanted to know if it showed any nudity or obscene scenes and was quite pleased to find out none of that was depicted in the movie. The movie is great for middle school children and perfect if you are planning on teaching your students about the Underground Railroad. The movie is great at showing what exactly is the underground railroad. They do include the character of Harriet Tubman in the movie and information about slavery as well as the role that Canada played with the underground railroad. Overall I was very pleased with the movie and can't wait to show my students the film as an intro to Ch 13 of their U.S. History 8 textbooks. I highly recommend this movie to any teacher who is teaching about slavery and the underground railroad. It also would be great if you allow your students to listen to the song Follow the Drinking Gourd prior to showing the movie so that they understand the movie a little better. I found that the Weavers version of the song is pretty good since it gives the students an explanation of what exactly the song is saying prior to singing it.,1394409600,95,1206,4.436936936936937
5717218,5,B00CDWQNZ4,The movie did an excellent job portraying the trials the slaves went through trying to get freedom. I recommend this movie.,1394064000,20,123,4.904761904761905
