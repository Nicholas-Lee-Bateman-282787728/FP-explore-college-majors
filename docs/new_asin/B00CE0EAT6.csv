8580731,5,B00CE0EAT6,"Seriously, I have submitted the first review in each volume that I purchased.  Those who are following this series knows how good it is and we continue to enjoy it after it has ended.  The love story of ""Ser Chief"" and ""Maya"" is a pleasure following.  I missed the first few weeks since I was in Florida but my wife helped me get into watching it.  Thank you Amazon and the vendor selling it.",1366243200,2,392,4.256756756756757
