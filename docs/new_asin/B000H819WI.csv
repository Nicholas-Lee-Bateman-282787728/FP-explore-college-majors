8137500,5,B000H819WI,"This is a second in a series of DVD I purchased for use with my Bible Study and CCD class.  This series takes you to the actual site where the stories of the Bible took place.  It is beautiful photography and great explanation of the importance of these stories.  I had already used the David DVD with great response by the classes.  I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to gain insights into the history of our faith.  The DVD includes a booklet with questions for discussion.  The item arrived quickly, in good packaging and was in excellent condtion as promised.  The item came ahead of the delivery expected dates and I was so very grateful for it.",1416528000,2,664,4.483333333333333
