7982718,4,B00008G7FB,Nicely done and it is enjoyable to watch...could have done without the group of skiers and the shadow of the helicopter....otherwise it is a good dvd and reasonable cost.,1323302400,,170,4.896551724137931
7982719,1,B00008G7FB,"The product discription and picture give an impression of a tranquil winter snow scene. There is little of that. Most of it is herky-jerky vertigo-inducing helicopter views that constantly jump and jitter from one shot to the next. The transitions are far, far too frequent and very jarring and abrupt. We are also 'treated' to many shots of another helicopter. Why they thought this would be enjoyable is a complete mystery to me, likewise the intrusive bands of skiers that pop up hither thither at random. Overall I truly detest this dvd and will be giving it away to Goodwill or somesuch. Further there is no option to simply hear the wind. All soundtracks are various blah renditions of music as listed in another review. Overall this dvd is a complete waste of money, unless perhaps you want to pretend you are hang-gliding while bouncing in and out of consciousness. ;-)",1157587200,10,877,4.814569536423841
7982720,4,B00008G7FB,"This relaxing DVD has 3 audio options:

1. Rocky Mountain Panorama (Wide Wide Land, Glittering Snow, Clouds On the Top, Dangerous Wonder, Mystic Rock, Silent Pray, etc)

2. Classical Winter Dreams (Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Bach, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, etc)

3. Romantic Strings (Handel, Brahms, Biordani, Beethoven, Grief, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, etc)

I admit that I was a little surprised that much of the first half of the DVD is shot from a helicopter.  You see a lot of untouched wilderness from the air, and many shots of a group of nine skiiers as they weave their way repeatedly through fresh snow.  Occasionally you catch a glimpse of the cameraman's own helicopter shadowed on the snow far below.  Mountains look different when you are looking down on them, than when you are looking up at them.  I suppose I prefer looking up at mountains, although this approach was interesting.  The second half of the movie has quite a few ground level shots, some even with blue sky, some with falling snow.  You get to see some deer looking shyly at you through the trees.  The music is lovely and relaxing.  However, I wish it was not looking down on the mountains so much, and I wasn't sure what to think of seeing so much of those nine skiiers.  I kept wondering how they got to the top of some of those wild mountains, with no ski lifts in sight, and what they were talking about when they would gather in little groups.  Also I wished for pictures of beautiful snowy lakes at the foot of mountains with softly falling snow -- there really isn't anything like that.

And yet, it is a nicely relaxing DVD with beautiful music and plenty of scenes of the Rocky Mountains.  This really is escapism, particularly if you like to watch people skiing from the viewpoint of a helicopter.",1156982400,4,1786,4.676282051282051
7982721,1,B00008G7FB,I hesitate to even consider buying this item because the product description is so vague and no one has bothered to give a review and with only one left in stock someone is bound to have something to say about it.  Does this DVD contain nature sounds alone without music?  Can you please give a little more detail?  I realize it's only $8.99 yet I still need to know more before I purchase.  I've been burned too many times on spending $20-$50 on vague descriptions.  Not again.,1149033600,5,478,4.448275862068965
