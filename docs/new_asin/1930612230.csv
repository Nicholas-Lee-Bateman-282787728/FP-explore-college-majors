203014,5,1930612230,Very graphic but learned a lot.  Sometimes hard to understand some that were speaking but the narrator was very good.,1372636800,,117,4.85
203015,5,1930612230,A great way to remember to pray for those who suffer for the right to worship  Jesus. A story of perseverance.,1369440000,3,110,4.238095238095238
203016,5,1930612230,This is a great thought provoking look at what we face with the growing swarm of mercenaries that will go anywhere and kill anyone.,1353456000,,131,4.5
203017,5,1930612230,"Incredibly powerful true story. You can't believe the atrocity until you see it and then the amazing story of how God brought victory, hope and restoration to a hurting people.",1349395200,3,176,4.9
203018,5,1930612230,"I really got a lot of great information from An Unconventional War.

This movie is about how Christians can mobilize and fight the enemy.  Having the Word of God in us can allow us to flow into the supernatural.

It's important to know that some of the Christians were fearful of the enemy, but those who believe and trusted God, He really showed up.

The President of Uganda met with one of the Pastors who took a stand in the movie.  That's what's about, take a stand for righteousness.",1349308800,3,488,4.438202247191011
203019,5,1930612230,This movie gives an often ignored background to Joseph Kone's reign of terror in Northern Uganda and shows the reason he has moved out of Uganda.  It shows spiritual warfare and what happens when Christians pray!,1336435200,4,212,4.888888888888889
203020,5,1930612230,"This is a powerful story of the war that has been opressing northern Uganda for the past twenty years. The documentary dives into the spiritual aspects of the war much more so than any other piece I have seen on the subject. It is a little pricey on Amazon but well worth it.

I'm now editing my old review. After receiving the film, I found out that it doesn't work at all. The return process is so annoying that I'm not even going to bother returning it.",1189296000,6,456,4.241379310344827

7801423,5,1930612230,Very heartbreaking but worth the watch. Makes me want to go all the more!,1463443200,,73,4.285714285714286
7801424,3,1930612230,"I wanted to learn more about the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) prior to travelling to Uganda, and this documentary did have a lot of excellent and very moving footage of the actual people who have been so horribly affected by the abductions and violence in Northern Uganda.  And I did learn the basics of the history of the LRA, but only in broad generalizations.  I probably should have been more aware of the producers of this video prior to renting it, though.  This documentary has a very strong fundamentalist Christian message, and includes montages with Christian music playing and discussions with victims about the importance of Christian forgiveness.  I also found it rather weird that the documentary seems to take quite seriously the issue of LRA use of witchcraft, as if the filmmakers also believe in the power of witchcraft.  And there is an emphasis on the importance of ""true Christian"" faith and prayer in order to defeat the LRA.  Apparently it was Uganda's ""return to God"" that finally pushed Kony and the LRA out of Uganda, not the deployment of the Ugandan army.  For example, they show some Christians splashing ""cleansing"" water over an LRA alter in order to destroy its evil witchcraft power, and this inspires the watching soldiers to join in their cause.  The ""dark powers"" were no match for Uganda's ""Christian powers.""

Technically, this documentary has some problems as well.  It would be nice if there were subtitles, as some of the interviewees are difficult to understand.  Also, the sound mixing is rather uneven -- some speakers sound very soft and are drowned out by the background noise or music that has been mixed in.",1434844800,,1655,4.896057347670251
7801425,5,1930612230,What an incredible story of forgiveness and the power of Light over darkness!,1424908800,,77,5.0
7801426,2,1930612230,"I would have given it more stars but because there was no closed captioning it was almost impossible to understand the
speakers with their Ugandan accents. The true story was one I had not been familiar with and am glad I now know as it is part of a difficult history in Uganda. What one can't understand can be looked up online.",1410480000,,329,4.32258064516129

7801428,5,1930612230,"This video describes the actions and prayer that saved a group of young Ugandan women who were kidnapped from a Christian school - very similarly to the recent events in Nigeria. Inspiring, challenging, and convicting.",1401321600,,218,5.257142857142857
7801429,5,1930612230,"Why isn't this film more well known?? It should be the talk of every major city worldwide! What a tragedy that something so important is so obscure.  This film is shocking on many levels. Besides detailing the atrocities committed by the LRA, it shows the role of spiritual warfare to turn the tide of these horrific situations. Any person of any faith should find this film enlightening and intensely thought provoking. Spiritual skeptics should watch with an open mind and consider the implications of believing--or not believing--that a supernatural realm exists and an invisible fight between angels and demons are what is behind the things that ravage countries and families.",1392076800,,680,5.181818181818182
7801430,5,1930612230,I believe this incredible story is a picture of how the rest of us are going to have to deal with the powers of darkness in the days ahead. It's too easy to blame people without getting to the spiritual roots.,1391126400,,209,4.121951219512195
