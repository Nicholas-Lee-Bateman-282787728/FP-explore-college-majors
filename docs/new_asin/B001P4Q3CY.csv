3737860,4,B001P4Q3CY,"This is an adorable movie.  The characters are really funny and likeable.  I was totally caught off guard by how smart this movie turned out to be. A great take on the classic fairy tale. Very appropriate for kids, and a great message to boot! Definitely recommend.",1238112000,,265,4.617021276595745
3737861,2,B001P4Q3CY,"The family (wife and kids 8 and 9) thoroughly enjoyed the tongue in cheek wit and originality of the first HNA. There is a reason this cheap remake went straight to DVD. Here is the quick and dirty (or should I say fairly ugly).....

Story and dialogue is inane and could have been written by a 8 year old. All of the originality of the first is lost in the repetitive valley girl/cool kid blabbering of snow white and her friends. In addition, the ""story line"" if I dare call it that is a complete remake of the ""tip the scales by the wizard's minions"" of the first movie but the minions have completely lost their charm and wit. There is of course the nice wholesome message of the spoiled privileged royalty looking down their noses at the poor lower class and snow white's inevitable redemption but it is so ""in your face"" that it is best suited to a toddler or a bright golden retriever. In all fairness, the kids gave it 3 stars but I dropped it here so you won't have to suffer this more than your one time rental.

Animation is very grainy and looks absolutely horrible (Std. DVD/PS3/50 inch Pioneer Plasma.)Shrek/Nemo/etc this is not!

Rent it at REDBOX for $1 and if the kids are under 11 you might get your money's worth. Better yet rent BOLT instead.",1237939200,22,1262,4.407725321888412
3737862,5,B001P4Q3CY,"This is the one they should have released as a movie! The story is cute, the songs are great and the animation is better than those Bratz movies.  Fun movie for the pre-teen/early teen crowd!",1237852800,2,191,4.457142857142857
3737863,3,B001P4Q3CY,My 6 year old like it.,1481241600,,22,2.8333333333333335
3737864,2,B001P4Q3CY,"Not as good as the first movie. Bored with the ""hip-hop"" dancing and groovin' sections that seemed out of place with the story.",1481241600,,127,4.565217391304348
3737865,4,B001P4Q3CY,My 4 year old daughter really like this movie.,1481155200,,46,4.222222222222222
3737866,2,B001P4Q3CY,"This movie looks like it was animated in India and is horrendously ugly, but my four-year-old liked it so it gets two stars. The story is kind of a cute twist on Snow White, and teaches that it's better to help others than to indulge in selfishness, so the movie isn't all bad. However, it's visually unappealing enough that I'll be discouraging her from watching it a second time.",1479772800,,381,4.536231884057971
3737867,4,B001P4Q3CY,Nice movie,1479168000,,10,4.5
3737868,1,B001P4Q3CY,the quality of the animation is awful. If I could return it I would but unfortunately we started it. Amazon will not refund on a started show. Watch the preview is my advice! The first one Happily Never After was cute so I figured this one would be as well.....,1473206400,,261,4.24
3737869,5,B001P4Q3CY,"Rented this for my grandchildren to watch, and it is a great video (even for me to watch with them).  Renting movies on Amazon is convenient and better than purchasing.  Although more expensive than Redbox, at least I don't have to leave the house to pick it up and return it!",1470787200,,276,4.392156862745098

3737878,2,B001P4Q3CY,"My kids decided to re-watch all of the worst movies they had ever seen, and this one was at the top of their list. The animation is quite awful with, for example, the king's hands twice the size of his head. The movement of the characters was just weird and inhuman. Overall, it seemed like the animation was unfinished, as if the movie's budget ran out before they completed the film. The plot is a typical kids' movie sequel.",1413072000,,427,4.417721518987341

3737889,3,B001P4Q3CY,"I didn't understand it. It's very hard to understand.  And you know, Snow White's mother in the movie, she came back alive when she died.  And that part was difficult to understand.  That was very weird too!!!

Written by my six year old son.",1405123200,,242,4.431818181818182
3737890,3,B001P4Q3CY,"Adorable, quirky, loved the modern touches and I did watch the whole thing.  I found the other princesses/fable stars thoroughly annoying but maybe that was the point.",1404864000,,167,5.185185185185185
3737891,2,B001P4Q3CY,The animation was not what I was used to watching not as good as toy story or shrek but my daughter watched it and sat thru it so I'm assuming she liked it.,1404777600,,156,3.757575757575758

3737895,2,B001P4Q3CY,Mondern day version of Snow White.  It was hard to understand what was going on in the movie. It didn't keep the interest of the kids.,1403913600,,134,4.153846153846154
3737896,5,B001P4Q3CY,The little ones really enjoyed this movie. IT kep[ them entertained foe few hours. THEY ENJOY WATCHING MOVIES AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.,1403308800,,131,4.739130434782608
3737897,4,B001P4Q3CY,"Cute spin-off to the usually girly Snow White for my seven year old boy. He thought it was fun and funny and watched til the end. If I were to buy it I'd probably pay no more than five dollars, it would be disappointing for a thirty dollar movie theatre trip... But for free with my Prime membership and him liking it at home, it's four stars for sure!",1402617600,,352,4.115942028985507
3737898,2,B001P4Q3CY,"This movie held my 9 yr old daughter's attention.  She said that there were a couple of funny parts here and there, and that it was very interesting.  I didn't watch the movie but heard parts of it.  In those parts, the characters were not talking very nicely to one another, and were acting like bratty teenagers.  I wish producers of children's films would have characters set good examples of how to talk with each other and not bad ones.",1402444800,,441,4.475
3737899,2,B001P4Q3CY,It was okay nothing like the 1st movie and the story line was bland. My 6 year old didn't even enjoy it.,1402444800,,104,3.772727272727273
3737900,5,B001P4Q3CY,"This movie was hilariously funny, especially as a last-day-of-school movie for 6th graders.  Great movie, and it was a neat twist on an old favorite.",1402185600,,149,4.96
3737901,3,B001P4Q3CY,"This movie is really good and funny, but not at all appropriate for my kids age range.  The comedy was more geared towards adults than kids, but overall it was a decent movie",1402012800,,174,4.2727272727272725
3737902,1,B001P4Q3CY,"This movie made Snow White out to be a shallow, vapid socialite.  She gets redeemed in the end but not before I was thoroughly disgusted.  I know they were trying to make it relevant but it was miserable.",1401926400,,204,4.342105263157895

3737904,3,B001P4Q3CY,My kids loved it and that's all that really mattered! HD does not make much of a difference either way.,1400716800,,103,4.2
3737905,3,B001P4Q3CY,It was okay but a little too crude in places for younger kids....I am a middle school teacher and wouldn't show this at school,1400544000,,126,4.291666666666667
3737906,1,B001P4Q3CY,"I thought this movie would be as good as the original Happily Never After, but no.... Not only was the animation horrible, the music was also horrible.  This movie is more of a teenager trying to fit in and finding herself.... but with nursery rhyme characters.  Happily never after for the movie.  The humor was very dry.  Dryer then the desert.  It wasn't funny.  Little kids wouldn't enjoy this... No one would!",1400284800,,414,4.680555555555555
3737907,1,B001P4Q3CY,My 5 year old enjoyed it. However I was disgusted with the way they talked and acted. I might as well put on Bratz for her to watch. Which I normally won't let her watch at her age.,1399939200,,181,3.789473684210526
3737908,1,B001P4Q3CY,Poor animation quality. Don't waste your time. Sometimes it actually looks like it was originally made for a different language.,1399766400,,128,5.45
3737909,1,B001P4Q3CY,"My daughter liked the first of this series just fine, but felt that she'd wasted her time and went out to play about 3/4 of the way through it. Not recommended.",1398643200,,160,4.193548387096774
3737910,2,B001P4Q3CY,"It was okay. Nothing great, but watchable.  My 4 year old liked it, although it was way over her head. I wouldn't pay to own it.",1398124800,,128,3.923076923076923
3737911,4,B001P4Q3CY,First off the animation is rather lacking but once you look past it/get used to it the story line is rather good. I like how it tied in modern technology and ideas but yet kept some of old world ones. Liked how it ends with a good life lesson. Would be good for about a 3rd or 4th grade girl.,1398124800,,292,3.8833333333333333
3737915,4,B001P4Q3CY,"Snow White had developed some attitudes that were not becoming to a princess, but with some help from friends learned what was needed",1397952000,,133,4.826086956521739

3737917,5,B001P4Q3CY,"I give it 5 stars, not do to my liking, because I didn't buy it for myself. I bought it for my daughters that are 5 and almost 2 years old. They loved it, and watched it over and over again. Graphics are like that of the new style of cartoons. The story line could have been better in my opinion. But like I said my daughters enjoyed it and thats what matters.",1396051200,,360,3.9452054794520546
3737918,4,B001P4Q3CY,"Granddaughter liked it enough to watch it again. typical chidrens movie, of the modern style. Pretty colorful characters and well animated.",1395964800,,139,5.666666666666667

3737920,5,B001P4Q3CY,"My 11 year old granddaughter was staying with me and bored.  So, we looked at the Amazon Prime streaming and she found this movie.  She really enjoyed it and we couldn't pull her away from it! No longer bored.",1395705600,,209,4.333333333333333
3737921,5,B001P4Q3CY,"I don't get where people come off about the negativity. Obviously people without a story telling back ground...if you want rainbows and unicorns, then go watch Teletubbies. Back to the review...Snow White makes a complete turnaround from being a spoiled, popular brat to being a more caring and loving person like her mother was. Nobody dies, so that's a major positive with me (the mirror doesn't count...), and there is hope and forgiveness for the villain of the movie and even she has a brighter future at the end. I about cried! It's slightly cheesy, yes, but it has a really good message in it: Care for others, and not just yourself! At least, you take something home out of it. Sheesh, people. -=80)",1395187200,,707,4.709677419354839
3737922,5,B001P4Q3CY,My 4 year old grandson enjoyed the movie a lot - cute action and characters.  It was also entertaining for me as an adult.,1394236800,,122,4.083333333333333
3737923,5,B001P4Q3CY,"I would give it 2 stars, however, my 5 year old granddaughter who has watched it about 10 times would give it 10 stars.",1393977600,,119,4.0
3737924,5,B001P4Q3CY,Because I have always wanted to see this movie and I never found it I checked everywhere especially Nextflix!!! Thank you for having the movie,1393891200,,142,4.72
3737925,1,B001P4Q3CY,"Ok It sounded fine in the description but when I started watching and people were going ""holla"" I said that's it, terrible, I wouldn't waste even a free viewing on it.  Not even for kids",1393545600,,186,4.314285714285714
3737926,4,B001P4Q3CY,My 4 and 2 year olds both enjoyed it. They watched it two or three times in 24 hours. We have not seen the first one though.,1393113600,,124,3.6296296296296298
3737927,3,B001P4Q3CY,i liked the message of the show. it was a little to much of an attempt to modernize the Snow White story...it was decent but not exactly powerful.,1392854400,,146,4.25
3737928,1,B001P4Q3CY,"An absolutely pitiful excuse for a child's movie. If my children acted like those in the movie, they'd repulse me. We didn't make it through the entire movie and I wouldn't recommend you subject yourself to such intellectually void torture.",1392422400,,240,5.025

3737931,3,B001P4Q3CY,Not really appropriate for young kids. I would say this movie is more appropriate for the tween crowd. It is dark and snow white is defiantly not a role model.,1391212800,,159,4.333333333333333
3737932,1,B001P4Q3CY,OMG this movie was horrible. The first one was very cute but my wife and I could not wait for this one too end. It took us a good day or two just to get my girls to stop acting like the spoiled characters in this movie. Very disappointing.,1390953600,,239,3.8979591836734695
3737933,1,B001P4Q3CY,This film was not something I would want to rent again.  my kids thought it was scary looking.  It was worth a shot though.,1390348800,,123,4.083333333333333

3737935,4,B001P4Q3CY,"My daughter rented this, yes she is 7 and rents her own movies. she says she liked it and would see it again. I like it because I have prim and it is free for her to watch any time she wants.",1390089600,,191,3.5714285714285716

3737938,1,B001P4Q3CY,"The characters are bratty and spoiled and it definitely rubbed off on my daughter.  She came away saying, ""It's not fair"" and a host of other things a parent shouldn't hear from a three year old.  It won't play again in my house.",1389225600,,229,4.3023255813953485

3737943,5,B001P4Q3CY,"This movie was awesome, I liked it alot and so did my little one. There was nothing in this movie that was offensive or vulgar. Granted it will take a child maybe 7 or older to understand the point to the movie, but it's great for little kids too, the brightness and color and the little cat and pig made my little one laugh.

In this movie, Snow White is a teenage girl who likes to party and have fun, but does not fulfill her duty as a benevolent princess like her mom. Unfortunately her mom passes away due to sickness, so her dad tries to find a wife who can guide Snow White in the right direction. However, he ends up choosing a beautiful woman who has terrible intentions for Snow White. Can Snow White prevent their marriage and straighten her attitude as well?

The idea of this movie is quite creative. Initially I thought this movie would be suited more for young children, but I actually found it a little amusing since some of the characters are teenagers who reminded me a bit of my friends. The movie also conveys positive messages, such as true beauty comes from within.

The Cons
- The animation is terrible. It's extremely awkward to watch the badly-rendered characters move so unnaturally. Think early version of the Sims or worse.
- The content is garbage. Snow White is a spoiled brat for most of the movie. The evil stepmother's apple causes Snow White to spew mean gossip about everyone in her kingdom (a boring, petty, and anti-climactic alternative to the poisonous apples in other versions of Snow White). She learns how to treat others kindly, but that transformation happens in 5 minutes of screentime, and I'm still stuck on the previous 60 unbearable minutes of her brattiness.
- The soundtrack is bad mainstream pop/hip-hop that's incredibly cringe-inducing.
- The frequent usage of the slang term, ""holla"" is also cringeworthy.

The Pros
- It's relatively short compared to better-quality animated films, so you don't have to suffer for too long.

Conclusion
- Avoid this movie. I suggest Wall-e, Up, Toy Story 3... ANYTHING ELSE REALLY if you're looking for a computer-animated film for the whole family to enjoy.",1342483200,48,1323,5.004545454545455

My four year old likes it, but the rest of the family had trouble with it.  The jokes are ok, and at times the hidden humor is quite good and even clever, but over-all I can only give this a one star.

On a side note, my four year old made a tough connection with one particular scene.  In the film, the queen dies soon after a simple cough.  Now, whenever my wife coughs, my daughter asks her, ""are you going to die, now?""  Ouch.",1305417600,,634,3.9291338582677167
3738098,3,B001P4Q3CY,"Imagine a movie that tried to cash in on the whole ""fairy tale with a hip and modern twist"" craze made popular by Shrek.  Now imagine that it failed miserably at the box office. Finally, imagine its direct-to-video sequel, which is animated by a studio that looks like it learned its craft from the geniuses behind Ratatooing.

And you thought Disney direct-to-video sequels were bad.

So what possessed me to pick up Happily N'ever After 2: Snow White: Another Bite @ the Apple? Curiosity, I suppose. I wanted to see how bad it was and I went into it expecting a bad movie. I wasn't disappointed. It features sub-par animation that looks like it was taken from a Nintendo64 game; forgettable music; and horrendously predictable writing that tags every clich.

And I enjoyed every minute of it, because, unlike Ratatooing, Happily N'ever After 2 actually makes it into the so-bad-it's-good category.

It's the story of Snow White ... with a twist! Snow White's mother is loved by all. We are told this numerous times throughout the first four minutes of the movie. We are also given the greatest line of dialogue ever written. ""Mother, why does everyone love the Queen so much?"" ""Because she is beautiful."" There you have it, folks. People will love you if you're beautiful. But wait! It gets better! ""Am I beautiful?"" ""Uh..."" It's brilliant!

So the Queen--who apparently sleeps in her clothes, probably due to the high cost of modeling new ones--dies of Incurable Cough of Death. Flash forward ""many years later..."" and Snow White is an adult. Apparently there were huge but inconsistent strides made in technology during that time because people now have cameras and cell phones that project holograms, but they still use horses and carriages to get around. We're also introduced to Snow White's hip catchphrase that's sure to never be outdated: ""Holla!"" Genius! It's quickly revealed that Snow is a jerk who needs to learn the true meaning of helping others. SPOILER ALERT! By the end of the movie, thanks to a pop music montage, she does! Anyway, the King thinks Snow needs a role model, so he decides to marry someone beautiful, because, after all, beautiful people always make good role models. The evil soon-to-be stepmother decides to ruin Snow's reputation--because she's evil, I guess. She's never really given a good reason, but that's not important! What's important it the way how she goes about her brilliant evil plan! She will give Snow White an apple that will ... not kill her, no ... even better ... it'll make her a gossip! Then everyone will hate her! MWAHAHAHAHAH! It's genius!

After running away because everybody hates her, Snow White meets the Seven Dwarves, who teach her the true meaning of helping others. She returns (with a handsome knight) just in time to stop her father's wedding to the evil stepmother. Only then does the evil stepmother decide to kill Snow White. She fails miserably, but Snow forgives her, because ... that's the right thing to do? Anyway, it ends with all the characters dancing to some hip, upbeat, forgettable song. Just like all the others.

The animation is dreadful, and everything looks like it's made of plastic. The inverse kinetics are some of the worst I've seen, with things floating rather than balancing on characters' heads. The movement looks like an old video game cut scene, and the mouth flaps don't often match the dialogue, which is awful and groan-worthy. There are tons of plot holes, and with its obvious plot, bumbling henchman, forgettable pop songs, ""hip"" catchphrases, and characters dancing to some hip, upbeat, forgettable song it comes with every clich. It's horrible, but it's funny, though the biggest joke of all is it wasn't meant to be funny in the way that it is actually is funny. As a work of art, it fails in all but one respect, but at least it succeeds in the most important task of all: It entertains.",1278460800,5,3899,4.843843843843844
3738099,1,B001P4Q3CY,"Seriously bad, annoying movie. It tries to hard to be hip and ends making you sick. If you want to hear girls shout ""Holla"" every few minutes then go ahead and get it. If you let your kids watch this and they end up quoting it you'll really wish you hadn't.
If the ""dialogue"" wasn't enough to turn you off the animation is really poor. Its like when you watch the making of Shrek and they're showing you the scenes that aren't finished, grainy and unreal.

After the reviews if you still want to rent this, I recommend a lobotomy instead. Trust me, it'll will be much more fun than this banal irritating movie.",1271548800,,610,4.350877192982456

3738103,1,B001P4Q3CY,"If you enjoy high quality Computer Graphics Animation: This movie is not for you.
Having seen the first Happily Never after, I was expecting another visually delightful CG experience.
I spent about 20 minutes trying to adjust my dvd player and monitor, and even put in the first Happily Never After dvd to make sure that my equipment was still working properly. (Sony BluRay with up conversion and a 42"" Visio 1080p monitor).
The display is extremely grainy and almost looks like someone copied it using a video camera. I thought it might be a pirated copy until I read a couple of the negative reviews here.
I noticed the animation was very poor also, something you might expect 10 years ago on a cheap Saturday morning cereal commercial. Definitely no even remotely of the same quality as the first movie.
I don't know where Amazon got the still pictures for this movie, but they are definitely WAY better quality than what is really in the movie. I would guess that if you took the small movie sample and blew it up to the size of your tv screen, it would resemble the picture quality of the dvd I received.
I must assume that some of the other reviewers here watched the movie on a normal television, which only displays 256 lines of video resolution. At that resolution the movie might look the same as any other movie.
I cannot comment on the story line or dialog, because I was so upset at the very poor video quality, I didn't watch more than the first few minutes over and over while I fussed with my monitor and DVD player.
When I look at the great picture and animation quality of the first movie, I can only assume that the producers wanted to foist this 'B-team' flop on the public to make a fast buck, hoping we would all think that it would be as good as the first one. Unbelievable!
