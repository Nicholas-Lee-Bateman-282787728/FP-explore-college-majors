I would like some purchase options on DVD episodes of Captain Kangaroo, specifically 1960-1968. What a great kids' show. Don't make them like that anymore. I'd like to share the Captain's vision with my grandkids some day....",1336089600,19,324,4.909090909090909
8101384,3,B000CS29TA,"I bought this item, believing it to be an episode of the beloved program I watched as a child.  I made this decision based on the picture on the cover, which shows the Captain as he looked in the 1970s and 1980s.

That is NOT what this is, despite the illustration!  It is a vintage black-and-white episode of Captain Kangaroo from the early days of television.  Although I did find it somewhat fascinating, it was not at all what I thought I was getting. The cover is extremely misleading.  For some reason, CBS railroaded Captain Kangaroo (ultimately creating that short-lived Saban abomination), and his program is not available anywhere on DVD.  All you can find are those few ""best of"" videos made shortly before his death, which are basically clip shows.  I was looking for a REAL episode, where he says at the end, ""And remember Moms & Dads, be good to your young person today.  Spend time with them.""  OK, I admit that what I got was a ""real"" episode, but not of MY Captain.  I might have enjoyed this more if I knew what I was getting and didn't pay so much for it.  Maybe you should buy this if you're a student of history or film, but not if you're under 50 years old and remember him from his color TV years.  Don't be fooled by that picture, and don't make the same expensive mistake I made.  Hopefully this review will drive that ridiculous price down (at the time of this writing, this video has gone for $90-250).  And please, someone release some actual episodes that could be shown to today's kids.",1264723200,37,1516,4.465454545454546
