I'm really pissed and the only reason i gave this 5 stars is because its a great show, but i'm just a kid and $75 is asking a lot.",1220054400,2,297,3.5692307692307694

- It comes with a different 'episode selection' screen than Season 1, but I can't take screenshots now XD (and it's not that big a deal, lols)

Any more questions? :0

- Oh, my personal favorite episodes in this Season are ""What's Opera, Arnold?"", ""Arnold's Halloween"", ""Monkey Business"", ""Helga's Boyfriend"", and ""Runaway Float"" lol! But these are all subjective, mind you. ;)

Thank you, Amazon/Nickelodeon! Though you are taking a while to make/ship the DVDs now ;) lol, I bet you didn't think so many people wanted them, eh? ;D hehehe! Thanks for reading!",1221004800,17,1490,5.036585365853658

8298204,5,B001EHDSOI,"I'm so glad these are full seasons and not best of, like other series like Doug or Angry Beavers, I don't understand why Amazon is not selling season 3, anyway, every episode is great. I'm so glad I can have my favourite cartoon on dvd.",1303257600,,236,4.266666666666667
8298205,5,B001EHDSOI,"Don't let the price tag scare you away, its a great product in which Amazon has exclusive rights for. The quality is still good, so don't be concerned about that. It was actually surprising how clear the picture was. Buying it will help support the show.

The show is great for all ages, and definitely worth showing to the kids of 2000.

Season 2 is full of laughs and fun with great episodes like:

Save the tree: when the kids all band together to stop Big Bob from tearing down their tree.
Helga's Love Potion: when Helga tries a potion to fall out of love with Arnold.
Phoebe Cheats: when Pheobe must deal with her conscience after copying a poem out of a book.
What's Opera Arnold?: when Helga dreams up a fantastic musical with her and Arnold as the stars.

Overall a awesome season. One of my favorites.",1297123200,,811,4.422818791946309
8298206,5,B001EHDSOI,"I think the title explains most of it...

Hey Arnold! is my favorite animated series (and probably my favorite show regardless of media). There really isn't much to say in terms of reviewing it. The episodes are all there with the theme song (in my opinion, one of the greatest theme songs ever composed).",1290729600,,305,4.648148148148148
8298207,5,B001EHDSOI,"I loved watching Hey Arnold as a child in the late nineties/early two thousands. Hey Arnold is so much better than Cat Scratch or Penguins of Madagascar, or quite frankly any recent Nickelodeon shows. I miss these shows. They should also put the Wild Thornberries out of DVD as well, that was a good one too. In regards to the Hey Arnold DVD set, I was very pleased with it, it's perfect. Everything arrived in one piece and I have no complaints in regards to shipping or anything like that. You'll love these, I know i did.",1272067200,,524,4.412371134020619
8298208,5,B001EHDSOI,"Hey Arnold is that rare combination of entertainment and a good solid moral message. It's the ""Andy Griffin"" of our times. All five seasons are worth the investment.  Sit down and watch these episodes with your children, older family members and your adult friends, it will spark some very invigorating conversations.  Everyone can relate to this cast of characters at some point in their lives.  Watch Hey Arnold, it's that hidden jewel yet to be discovered and appreciated on so many levels.",1271203200,,493,4.987804878048781
8298209,5,B001EHDSOI,"Hey Arnold is the last of it's kind. It has great character development and great story lines. My children enjoy the cartoon and I don't have to worry about offensive subject matter or questionable language. It shows children of all ethnic, social and religious backgrounds getting along without ever entertaining the idea that it has to be explained , it just simply is. I love the music scenes,the different personalities of the children and Arnold's family at the boarding house. Great cartoon for all ages.",1271116800,2,510,5.011764705882353
