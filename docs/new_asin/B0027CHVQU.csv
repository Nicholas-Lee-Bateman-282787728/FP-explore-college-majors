3863765,3,B0027CHVQU,"Surfing seems to be the sport of choice for most young men in ""Newcastle"" (Australia, 2008), a community on the coast of Australia.  17 year old Jesse is turning into a championship surfer, which turns up the resentment from his older brother Victor, a former competitive surfer whose wins were cut short by an injury.  Then there's Jesse's twin brother, Fergus, who is kidded royally by his siblings and their friends for not being particularly athletic, and for having a repressed but obvious crush on Jesse's best friend, Andy.

Jesse and Fergus (along with their friends, including Jesse's girlfriend and another girl) take a weekend trip to desolate area of the coast to smoke pot, drink and surf.  All goes well until Victor and his friends show up, resulting in a reckless surf challenge ending in tragedy.

This is not really a ""gay film"" at all, despite its presence at gay film festivals and heavy promotion in gay media. The characters of Fergus (who is kidded ruthlessly but good naturedly by his friends about his apparent crush on Andy) and one other minor gay role (the boys' grandfather, used more for comic relief) aren't developed even to the point where their homosexuality is fact rather than rumor, and don't add much to the overall story.  The acting is adequate, with no performance really noteworthy. The ""coming of age in a dysfunctional family"" plot is simplistic, which I am thankful for, since it was often difficult for me to understand the dialogue under some rather thick Aussie accents (the latter, of course, is my problem, and doesn't affect the rating).  However, what ""Newcastle"" is, more than anything else, is an exceptionally well photographed film that will stand up to any classic ""surf film"" for its beauty and breathtaking action scenes.  A bonus with the great photography: more than enough ""eye candy"" to keep gay viewers tuned in.  Some partial (rear) nudity, sexual situations, likely would be a light ""R"" if rated for USA viewership.

The DVD includes a ""Making of"" featurette as well as director commentary.  I give this film three stars (out of five) overall, which includes an extra simply for the photography/eye candy.",1250208000,8,2171,4.936813186813187
3863766,5,B0027CHVQU,"Once in a while a film comes along which tries to be bold, daring, and provocative while still retaining enough ""warm and fuzzy' to appeal to American audiences. The result is usually a self-indulgent train wreck that smacks of too many engineers in the locomotive. First time writer/director Dan Castle attempts it in ""Newcastle,"" and the result will leave audiences wide-eyed with amazement.

The setting is a section of Australia flanked by the sound of heavy industry on one side and the crash of some of the best waves in the world on the other. It is here that a complex family drama is played out, with three brothers caught in a struggle for individual freedom and respect from each other. Older brother Victor has seen his championship surfing days come and go, so it's no wonder he harbors some resentment towards his 17-year-old brother Jesse, on the rise to becoming a champion himself. Jesse's twin brother Fergus throws everyone for a loop with his ever-changing hair color and enigmatic personality. Dad tries to hold it all together but, like any working class parent, struggles to find the time to even be present enough to make a difference. An assortment of surfer guys and gals adds even more peer pressure, and what starts out as a beach outing becomes a defining moment for everyone.

That said, ""Newcastle"" is anything but a film about surfing. Yes, it was a requirement that the actors be able to surf, but most young Australians do anyway. So casting was not a problem. And it's this brilliant ensemble cast that makes the multi-layered narrative work so well. Themes of parental responsibility, sibling rivalry, and unspoken sexuality revolve around a gritty coming-of-age story which, ultimately, is really more about brotherly love than anything else.

The story's true focus is on the relationships among the young men, specifically the two younger brothers and their feelings towards each other, their parents, their mates, and their girls, or guys, as the case may be. It's always hard to single anyone out in an ensemble cast but this film touches the heart more than anything by the performances of Lachlan Buchanan and Xavier Samuel as Jesse and Fergus. Their relationship is both heartening and heartbreaking in turn, and it only works because the on screen chemistry is so palpable. Their commanding presence says that these guys have a bright future in cinema. Reshad Strik is riveting as the tortured older brother and Shane Jacobson shines as the father who is the antithesis of the typical American movie's working class brute of a dad - this guy has the heart of an ox. Kirk Jenkins (Andy), Ben Milliken (Nathan), and Israel Cannan (Scotty) are the core of the surfer mates - Cannan provides much of the film's comic relief (and contributes several songs to the soundtrack). All add nuances and layers to their characters which surface when one least expects it.

Production values belie the film's modest budget, with the polished look of a Hollywood movie from the first to last breaking wave. The soundtrack is killer, an absolute requirement for any film featuring competitive sports. Most of all, though, the cinematography is breathtaking. Richard Michalak's shots of surfers riding the waves, with his camera looking up from the ocean floor, had me shaking my head with wonder. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. I avoid spoilers at any cost but I feel confident in saying that there are several scenes which will bring tears to your eyes. ""Newcastle"" sets a new standard for underwater photography.

Various elements in the film, taken individually, aren't necessarily anything we haven't seen before. But it's the way Castle integrates them and the lengths to which he is willing to take them which makes ""Newcastle"" so refreshing. There is some content which may be too uncomfortable for theatergoers who have issues with male nudity and sexuality. Some scenes will likely have young guys squirming in their seats, but perhaps America has progressed to the point that we can appreciate a film which dares to be different.

With ""Newcastle,"" Dan Castle pushes the boundaries of the typical American coming-of-age slash sports competition film (in this case, surfing). Perhaps he can do it because it is not, in fact, an American film at all but hails from Australia. Perhaps he can get away with it because it wasn't churned out by a Hollywood studio and didn't have the hand of the usual producers and distributors whose financing would undoubtedly come with strings attached. Or perhaps it's just because he had a vision and the tenacity to surround himself with others who wouldn't compromise. In the end, nothing is as it seems at first glance. ""Newcastle"" is a totally unexpected film at a time when there are far too few.",1248825600,46,4777,4.942714819427148

3863831,5,B0027CHVQU,"This is a great film, make no mistake about it. Mr. Castle, the writer/director, uses a fusion of cinematic styles: French New Wave, Italian Neorealism, and classical Hollywood cinema, to create something truly original and consequential. His masterful integration of cinematography, editing, sound manipulation, and music track create a sense of memory, what it feels like to be a 17 year old, trying to figure out one's place in the world.

Thus, I don't think this is a film for teenagers - all the chaos and noise and music and confusion and rage and elation and sexual discovery feel perfectly normal to them. It also lacks the idiotic vulgarity of most teen flicks or the reassuring confirmation of the norm that an ""American Graffiti"" or a John Hughes movie might offer. That's not to say that some mature teens and 20-somethings won't get the film, I just think an adult's perspective gives this film its punch.

It's the little moments in which ""Newcastle"" absolutely soars, as when the six friends are speeding in their vehicle, radio blaring with their favorite song on, all of them joining in. It's like the real life version of that scene in ""Wayne's World"" when ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" comes on. What's captured on film is that feeling of youthful exuberance, of having your friends and being in that moment - even if ten minutes later you'll be at each other's throats for something ridiculous or mean-spirited.

Stylistic choices aside, what makes this film great is the way in which its subject matter is considered. These young men are all on the verge of manhood, trying on different identities, struggling with who they are and what they will become. The naturalistic tension that arises from their competitive, testosterone-driven natures and the Bad Choices they continually make reminded me of the men who populate Scorcese's films or the troubled young men from ""Saturday Night Fever."" Their friendships have the potential to be lethal. As do the sibling rivalries and father-son relationships.

And it's all performed with such ease and lack of pretense by the gifted, well-directed cast. I can sense this film's influence on the later, Oscar-nominated Australian film, ""Animal Kingdom."" So what's sad and shocking was how little critical attention this film received. One might speculate on the reasons for this: The (too?) subtle way in which it examines the issues of ambition and destiny? The unapologetic gay character who's neither a Monster, Martyr, nor Mary? Its usage of certain Hollywood elements? I don't know.

What I do know is that this is a thoughtful, masterful piece of cinema that deserves to be seen. And my hope is that Mr. Castle makes another film soon.",1388188800,,2696,5.008928571428571

3863833,4,B0027CHVQU,"Superb cinematography makes this ""surfing movie"" very enjoyable to watch. The young cast are excellent, but although this movie comes up with ""Gay themed"" searches it is not what I would call a gay movie.

3863835,2,B0027CHVQU,"Perhaps if the garbled, working-class Aussie accents were not so thick that this flick, in all seriousness, needs subtitles to become quasi-comprehensible, the story might be mildly compelling, but it is impossible to know for sure.  As it is, or near as one can tell, there are a bunch of dudes who are a-holes to each other 24/7; there's some nice--but definitely nothing like award-winning--surf footage; a handful of surf chicks whose dramatic purpose is solely to service the dudes' physical needs; and no matter how mediocre the movie, some people can always be relied upon to always bestow a minimum of four stars for anything showing some bare bubble butts running into the ocean, of which ""Newcastle"" has a marginally above average quota.  Near as I can tell, the guys in this flick are all half-wit jerk-offs going nowhere fast (except for the ""sensitive,"" probably queer one, who is a wuss, but--spoiler alert!--in the flick's very best moment, the wuss actually catches a wave and stands up on his board!).

Clearly, the film's point is that these perfectly tanned dudes are never going to be much of anything more than meat-head losers as a consequence of:
(a.) Australia's extreme endemic alcoholism (pretty much a given in any movie about Aussie dysfunction); or
(b.) the compound sociological and economic pressures of their under-privileged, industrial-adjacent environment; and/or possibly
(c.) a chronic shortage of appropriately charismatic mentors and/or role models to inspire realistic life goals beyond winning the next local surfing competition.

What? A surf flick with a heavy social conscience? Uh, no thanks. I'd suggest you give that concept a miss and watch virtually any real surf movie instead.  The inequities of the capitalist system and the ecstasies of surfing do not make for particularly synergistic narrative themes. Still, leave it to the Aussies to try to make a ""serious"" teen surf flick.",1381708800,,1931,5.176282051282051

This film was shot on Super 16 (mainly because it is a common format for underwater surfing shots) and looks great on this blu-ray disc.

In the U.S. and the U.K. Newcastle is marketed as a gay film. It is and it isn't. The teen surfer boys spend a lot of time in board shorts or less and make nice, blue-eyed, eye candy. The opening shot of Jesse, on a top bunk, opening his blue eyes to look out at the surf, is captivating. Then there is his darker, fraternal twin, Fergus (Xavier Samuels), who is a goth, gay kid with a streak of color in his hair. The cover of the U.K. release has Fergus/Xavier front and center, with a note that he is to appear in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga-Eclipse-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001UV4XFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. In truth, Xavier as vampire Riley in Eclipse is very different from Xavier the gay, meek Fergus of Newcastle.

There is a lot of surf in the film, a lot of dysfunctional family dynamics involving Jesse's older brother who was a better surfer but did not handle the transition to adulthood well, and a lot of teen angst. When the boys and a couple of girls take off for a weekend in the dunes we see some naked boy butts and watch Jesse lose his virginity up close. It is clear that Fergus has a crush on Jesse's friend Andy. When, as odd men out, they pair up that evening, Fergus and Andy progress from stargazing to views on homosexuality to talk of masturbation. Eventually the older brother shows up with friends and ruins the beach party. (And the water changes in color from turquoise to steely blue - on purpose as we learn in the extras.)

A lot has been made of the Fergus-Andy ""gay"" relationship. The gay director, Dan Castle, reportedly did not specifically see them as a gay couple, but had the two guys room together to bond, and told ""Andy"" to take the gay notion as far as he was comfortable. Australian men are not as chronically homophobic as are U.S. men, hence&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppetry-of-the-Penis-The-Ancient-Art-of-Genital-Origami/dp/B00008V62B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Art of Genital Origami</a>. Level-headed Andy is one of the few who do not make jokes (""Fagus"") about Fergus. True, after the accepting Andy gives Fergus permission to ""look"" the two become close. And, since both are shown buckling up as if they had been up to something, perhaps VERY close. But why not, since Fergus has no other friends and Andy is accepting of Fergus. At one point towards the end of the film Andy is referred to as Fergus's ""boyfriend,"" but it is clear that this is said in a friendly, loving way among friends. So I guess if you must consider Fergus and Andy to be a couple, by all means do. I doubt director Castle, will argue with you, since there is a market for fresh gay films.

The film ends with the two brothers, Jesse and Fergus, swimming naked together at a beach that is not clothing optional. It is clear that they are completely comfortable with each other's nudity as they swim like dolphins around an underwater camera in sun-dappled water, and as they run naked through the neighborhood back to their granddad's place. (A deft hand on the controls show they really are running naked if that is your thing.) Of course Xavier Samuels is not gay. Fergus is.

The Extras are worthwhile since they discuss the filming and the music. (One actor proved to be a talented musician as well.) The film is not perfect, but accomplishes what it set out to do: Sun, Surf, Skin.

3863870,3,B0027CHVQU,"This a film by gay director Dan Castle and has been advertised as a gay movie, and is being promoted by Peccadillo in the U.K. Up front this is not a gay film, it has one real gay character but a lot of cutsie, eye candy shots of buff boys in board shorts.

What it is about is the relationship between a family of three brothers and the pains of growing up and the endless surfing. This is quite testosterone fuelled but most of it is aimed towards competitive surfing, or arguing or making a lot of unnecessary noise and aggression. There is scant character development which I found disappointing.

Of the three brothers the middle on Jessie is trying to emulate his older brother's surf achievements. His elder brother was a success but has now faded into obscurity as not enough time in the classroom has led him to be a bit of a failure in the `real world'. He still lives at home as his relationship with his ex has broken down. The younger brother Fergus (Xavier Samuel) is gay and a goth and has no friends.

He gets invited to join Jessie and his friends for a weekend surf party up the coast, and that is where it gets interesting. Please note this is not a sex fest, it does have some mild nudity but as a 15 cert you can guess that this is fairly tame.

As I said not enough character development, but some very nice shots and if you are into surfing, then this is a must, I actually preferred `Tan Lines', but this is still an above average film and did not drag in the least, so for some light entertainment with eye candy a plenty this should `float your boat' or at least your boogie board.",1304640000,2,1607,4.276315789473684

I could relate to several things in my youth, so for me, there were some really funny parts. Almost like being there. :) I like how the characters, especially the brothers, bonded by the end of the movie.

3863874,5,B0027CHVQU,"This film was shot on Super 16 (mainly because it is a common format for underwater surfing shots) and the film looks great on DVD. A blu-ray disc of ""Newcastle Australia"" is available in the U.K. but not here.

In the U.S. and the U.K. Newcastle is marketed as a gay film. It is and it isn't. The teen surfer boys spend a lot of time in board shorts or less and make nice, blue-eyed, eye candy. The opening shot of Jesse, on a top bunk, opening his blue eyes to look out at the surf, is captivating. Then there is his darker fraternal twin. Fergus (Xavier Samuels), who is a goth, gay kid with a streak of color in his hair. The cover of the U.K. release has Fergus/Xavier front and center, with a note that he is to appear in Twilight: Eclipse. In truth, Xavier as vampire Riley in Eclipse is very different from Xavier the gay, meek Fergus of Newcastle.

There is a lot of surf in the film, a lot of dysfunctional family dynamics involving Jesse's older brother who was a better surfer but did not handle the transition to adulthood well, and a lot of teen angst. When the boys and a couple of girls take off for a weekend in the dunes we see some naked boy butts and watch Jesse lose his virginity up close. It is clear that Fergus has a crush on Jesse's friend Andy. When, as odd men out, they pair up that evening, Fergus and Andy progress from stargazing to views on homosexuality to talk of masturbation. Eventually the older brother shows up with friends and ruins the beach party. (And the water changes in color from turquoise to steely blue - on purpose as we learn in the extras.)

A lot has been made of the Fergus-Andy ""gay"" relationship. The gay director, Dan Castle, reportedly did not specifically see them as a gay couple, but had the two guys room together to bond, and told ""Andy"" to take the gay notion as far as he was comfortable. Australian men are not as chronically homophobic as are U.S. men, hence&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppetry-of-the-Penis-The-Ancient-Art-of-Genital-Origami/dp/B00008V62B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Art of Genital Origami</a>. Level-headed Andy is one of the few who do not make jokes (""Fagus') about Fergus. True, after the accepting Andy gives Fergus permission to ""look"" the two become close. And, since both are shown buckling up as if they had been up to something, perhaps VERY close. But why not, since Fergus has no other friends and Andy is accepting of Fergus. At one point towards the end of the film Andy is referred to as Fergus's ""boyfriend,"" but it is clear that this is said in a friendly, loving way among friends. So I guess if you must consider Fergus and Andy to be a couple, by all means do. I doubt director Castle, will argue with you, since there is a market for fresh gay films.

The film ends with the two brothers, Jesse and Fergus, swimming naked together at a beach that is not clothing optional. It is clear that they are completely comfortable with each other's nudity as they swim like dolphins around an underwater camera in sun-dappled water, and as they run naked through the neighborhood back to their granddad's place. (A deft hand on the controls show they really are running naked if that is your thing.) Of course Xavier Samuels is not gay. Fergus is.

The Extras are worthwhile since they discuss the filming and the music. (One actor proved to be a talented musician as well.) The film is not perfect, but accomplishes what it set out to do: Sun, Surf, Skin.",1283644800,3,3536,4.669341894060995
3863875,4,B0027CHVQU,"""Newcastle"" is typical of the style of many Australian films. It possesses a subtlety and sense of mystery that is usually missing in any mainstream American movie. Whereas U.S. audiences tend to be spoon-fed every little obvious thing by Hollywood studios, Australian films have a more European feel about them and Newcastle is typical of this. It has a gentle, meandering flow to it, laying out a storyline of male relationships in the context of a regional surfing community. It's not as powerful as most Aussie movies but a great 'rainy-day' movie to watch with some telling social commentary on masculinity and how culture defines it. If you want a gritty Australian film dealing with similar issues but in a far more complex and confronting way check out Ana Kokkinos' breathtaking movie ""Head On"" starring the gorgeous Alex Dimitriades.' In terms of iconoclastic daring, Head On has no equal in Australian cinema. It broke so many rules, offended so many polite conventions, attacked so many silences, that it left audiences stunned and gulping for air'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-On/dp/B00004YKR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head On</a>. see preview here: [...]",1273968000,,1215,5.644808743169399

It is refreshing, as it portrays straight/gay and gay/straight relationships . . . and doesn't seek to be classified (stereotyped) into either.

3863878,3,B0027CHVQU,"Buy this film if you want entertainment in the form of a gorgeously photographed and staged Aussie surf movie.  Full of very pretty people, lots of skin and sun and sand and deep blue water, it's reminiscent of ""Endless Summer"".  The young, unknown Aussie actors are fun and since they were chosen for their surfing skills first, they're clearly comfortable on their boards.

However, why this film is touted / marketed as an LGBT friendly picture is beyond me.  Jesse's brother Fergus (referred to by Jesse's friends as ""Fagus"") is an allegedly gay character, but beyond a little almost-snuggle with Andy and some innocent banter about them both liking stars and astronomy, you'll never know for sure.  The ""gay"" subplot in this film is beyond vapor thin and Fergus is stereotypically played as a shy, embarrassed goth-ish kid with black fingernails and constantly living in the shadow of his two very straight brothers.  The main themes and scenes in the story are all about the straight boys and girls and, of course, the surfing.

The movie's not all that bad.  It's reasonably well written and fairly well acted. The cinematography is terrific - particularly the water and surf footage.  All in all, it's a well crafted piece of cinema, but everyone's got to STOP referring to this thing as an LGBT movie just because it's released by Wolf.

3863879,4,B0027CHVQU,"What Newcastle is:
A movie about growing up
A movie about family and sibling rivalry
A movie about friendship
A movie about working-class Australian life
A movie about young men and their perspectives
A movie about ambition and desire
A movie about all aspects of the ocean, from the most joyous to the most dangerous
A movie with talented and natural young actors
A movie with fantastic music, especially the original songs by Israel Cannan, one of the actors
A movie with stunning cinematography, especially during the surfing scenes
A dvd with extras that struck me as quite fascinating, as they provide a really detailed look into all aspects of how an indie film gets made

What Newcastle is not:
A gay or straight film -- on one hand, the heterosexual relationships are much more explicitly shown, on the other, I found the relationship between Fergus and Andy to be much more engaging, functional, and complex
Hollywood in any way, shape, or form -- the storytelling is much more laconic, laid-back, and gritty, and the ocean and actors provide all the shine the movie needs
Perfect -- the storylines were a little uneven for me -- I was much more interested in a couple of the characters and their stories (Fergus!) than others (Jesse, unfortunately, given that if the movie can be said to have a protagonist, he's it); however, I noticed that other reviews highlight different characters as central, which leads me to believe that in a lot of ways, this is a true ensemble film, for better or for worse

Overall, I really enjoyed watching this beautiful, truthful film, and suspect I'll want to watch it again and again.",1264377600,11,1629,4.7935943060498225
3863880,3,B0027CHVQU,"Newcastle's most immediate apparent strengths are its beautiful cinematography and the looks of its actors.  The setting is around the busy titular port city about a hundred miles up the coast north of Sydney, Australia.  Most of the characters compete and relate through surfing, but this is not at heart a surfing movie.

Despite appearances, the central character is the older brother, Victor Hoff (Reshad Strick), an embittered former surfing champion.  When he injured his knee, he very assertively insisted his younger, twin step-brothers, Jesse (Lachlan Buchanan) and Fergus (Xavier Samuel), were not good enough to follow in his footsteps.  Jesse was determined to show up Victor.  Victor kept Fergus out of surfing altogether because Fergus needed glasses and was considered to be gay.  Their longshoreman father, Reggie Hoff (Shane Jacobson) and the twins' mother, Flora Hoff (Joy Smithers), bought in on Victor's premise and were not demonstrably supportive of Jesse's competing or of Fergus' even learning about surfing.  The father is shown counseling Victor or protecting the twins from Victor's physical intimidation but not trying to counsel the twins.  Jesse buys into Victor's views of Fergus.  Victor dominates.

Jesse's resentments cause him to compete too aggressively and unsafely.  When things go wrong, he lashes out at his friends, Andy (Kirk Jenkins), Scotty (Israel Canaan), and Nathan (Ben Milliken).  On a trip to the Stockton Dunes near Newcastle, Andy starts to teach Nathan how to surf, much to the disgust of Jesse.  Just as Nathan starts having some success, Victor shows up with two tough surfer pals.  As the going gets more competitive, the surf gets rougher too.  When Victor takes the initiative to get Nathan out of harm's way, Jesse's hostile surfing and the rising waves make overwhelming trouble for Victor and Andy.

With Victor gone, the Hoff family has to recover from years of abuse.  Bewildered Jesse has lost his reason for surfing.  It takes a night conversation at the top of a sharktower with Fergus to get Jesse remotivated and a discrete nude romp in the surf with Fergus for the brothers to bond.  The father does not give himself permission to watch Jesse compete until the father discovers that Victor kept newspaper clippings of Jesse's successes hidden away in Victor's trophies.  With the removal of a powerful, controlling personality, each of the rest of the family could find a path to a fuller life and more supportive family relationships.

The extras are a commentary track by the director and crew, three trailers, a making-of, four Wolfe previews, and a contest entry.  All the surfers show lots of skin, there is a night with sex with two girl friends and within a budding gay relationship.  The soundtrack is very good, the acting is good enough, and most viewers should enjoy the film.",1258761600,2,2856,5.09247311827957
3863881,1,B0027CHVQU,"This is not a gay film.  The gay character is a fringe one and a shameful stereotype.  There is plenty of heterosexual sex scenes but absolutely no man-on-man action.  No touching, no kissing, no simulated sex between the boys.

Another interesting point about this film is the bonfire scene at the beach.  This is an Australian film, filmed in Australia, with Australian actors, yet the characters are eating and mention ""smores"".  This is not something most Australians would have any idea about and it is blatantly inserted into this scene to appeal to an American audience.  I was watching with a group of other guys and all of them were like ""smores?""

The kid and his friends all go away on a surf weekend...they take along his brother, the brother never really comes out, but the film gives enough away to let you know he thinks one of the surfers is attractive etc...

The surfing shots are great and it was interesting to see the shots of Newcastle Australia.  Australia is ofen only shown in it's best light, but the shots of the town showed it as a somewhat depressed run down factory town.

However, if you're looking for a film with great surfing, lovely scenary, a few hot surfer dudes ad ample butt shots, watch this film.  It was cute, but I won't be hurrying to watch it a second time.

The plot goes something like this: a bunch of surfer dudes compete for a big title. 4 guys chase 2 girls, while 1 guy chases another guy. 3 older surfer dudes don't like the younger ones.  They challenge them and tragedy strikes.  An attempt at getting deep at this part is lost in the overall lightness of the film.

OK, fine, if that were the only flaw, I can live with that.  After all, I own many foreign language films.  Of course, they have subtitles.

Third, when the movie was over (yes, I eventually watched the whole thing, painful minute by painful minute), I didn't feel an ounce of connectivity to any character.
