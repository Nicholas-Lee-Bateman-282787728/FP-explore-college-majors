8086024,5,B000BFHS4A,"While visiting CA, I saw these DVD's at Deseret Book and thought it looked interesting, so I bought some of them.  We watched this FHE on DVD today and it captiviated even my 2 year olds attention through the whole thing!  I don't think we have ever had an FHE where he sat and paid attention, so I have to give this 5+++ Stars.  I love that you get to choose which song to sing, and you don't have to worry about finding the hymn book.  It is all there and organized for you, so that you can smoothly get through and FHE together, rather than trying to contain a jumbled family's attention.

It stops, so that the whole family can participate in the lesson.

I think that this would especially be perfect for a newer-member family, or a family who is just trying to start or re-start Family Home Evenings, because it is very simply laid out and can also asist in teaching families how to run an effective fhe's.

We will definitely be buying more of these awesome DVD's!",1164499200,,971,4.331491712707182
