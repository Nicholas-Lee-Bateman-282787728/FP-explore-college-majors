8335070,3,B001Q73ZUS,"It's not all I thought it would be.. I thought for sure it'd have more classic episodes..

A little disappointed the Rodman episode isn't on here.",1392595200,,146,4.615384615384615
8335071,5,B001Q73ZUS,"Even just part of Arliss is better than nothing. What is shown in the DVD is smart, worldly and just down right funny. I highly recommended it to those who want to see what a great cast can do with a great script. Hopefully one day the complete series will come out.",1383782400,,266,4.134615384615385
8335072,2,B001Q73ZUS,"DVD producer thought viewer wanted 10 of 12 baseball stories in a row.. .. followed by nothing. have no idea why the entire series remains unavailable. I'm sure everyone has favorite episodes and all of them deserve to be seen!

Also to make matters worse.. there is no play all option. Skip goes back to episode list.. not forward 5 minutes...

And even worse, this has 2 different item numbers..(and names)  making wishful thinking an expensive mistake.",1383177600,4,455,4.883116883116883
8335073,4,B001Q73ZUS,"Great series,  wish more was available, would have left off a couple of these episodes in favor of others if they were going to be so limited in the release.  Please release them all HBO !!!",1364169600,,190,4.25
