3004629,2,B000XPRMD0,"I rented this drama based off the high ratings on this page. Maybe I got my hopes to high with all of the high ratings, but I just can't recommend this show.

The basic plot: Korea is under a monarchy and due to some deal made by grandparents, the prince has to marry a commoner girl. Interesting enough. I love a marriage of convenience that turns into true love. Unfortunately, all it is is the prince staring stoicly into space and the girl vacilating between hamming it up with her foolishness or crying because the prince is such a meanie. I liked her in the beginning but as the show went on she just became annoying.

The actor who plays the rival for the girl's affection (the prince's cousin) was really good and brought a lot of heart to what could have been a stalker-like situation.

The most interesting part of the series were the power plays and love stories between the adults in the show- and all of their acting was top notch. If that had been the focus, the show would have been a lot stronger. I would groan every time I had to be dragged back to the bland conflict and chemistry of the main couple.

The sets and the outfits were all beautiful, but I had to struggle to finish this.

My friend told me that two dramas with beautiful costumes and couples with a lot of chemistry are Lovers in Paris and My Princess. I think I'll check those out instead.",1311465600,3,1373,4.34765625
3004630,5,B000XPRMD0,"This Korean Drama is simply, beautiful. I remembering when I first watched this series I was hooked! I stayed up watching it at night until 5 in the morning or until I finally crashed. The characters have great chemistry and are simply funny to watch! While this show can be very serious at times and even sad at other times, I have to say I was laughing most of the time, simply at the facial Expressions. It may seem a little pricy, but it is worth it!",1310428800,,454,4.2298850574712645

I stayed up many nights to watch multiple episodes. When it was over, I was sad to see that it ended the way it did. Apparently there were plans to continue but it never happened.

I truly hope they do continue the story and with the same actors. They were perfect for their roles. If you love to watch K Drama, this is definitly worth the investment. You will not be disappointed.",1304121600,,519,4.242424242424242

8228936,5,B000XPRMD0,It is so beautiful! I RECOMMEND THIS 100%. I have read the manga and it is almost the same as the drama. I have never laugh so much for a drama such as this. I have watched it 10 times already and I still enjoy it to the fullest. I also like the scenery of how it portarys of being poor to being royalty. I used to watch japanese dramas by now I am considering switching to korean dramas because the actors/tress are far more beautiful. This is worth the price.,1341792000,2,461,4.076923076923077
8228937,5,B000XPRMD0,"I think this is the most interesting miniseries I have watched ion a while.

With this one in particular,is important to me, because my husband is not a fan to watch TV, and he doesn't like soap operas or how we say in Spanish ""novelas"".  But this drama he love it.  He was in front of the TV everyday just to watch the drama. This was the 3rd drama that I saw, and one of my favorites. In total I thing I already watch between 5 to 8 Korean dramas.  I just love it!!!",1326499200,2,414,3.9047619047619047
8228939,5,B000XPRMD0,"Honestly, I'd give this ten stars if I could. This is a beautiful show. This is the second kdrama I watched, and made me like the actress Yoon Eun Hye. A lot of people did not like her role in this because she was whiny and selfish, but I disagree. Look at who she attempted to become close to. A cold-hearted selfish prince. But if you like a good love story, you'll like this.",1325808000,,378,4.121621621621622
8228940,4,B000XPRMD0,"Goong/Princess Hours/Palace , call it what you will (I like Goong best, Princess Hours doesn't really make sense to me as a title and Palace is just the English word for Goong) is a Cinderella story.  It is based on the premise that Korea does actually have a monarchy.  Prince Shin goes to an arts high school along with our heroine, Chae Kyung (Yoon Eun Hye, who I had watched in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-1st-Shop-of-Coffee-Prince/dp/B0011Z1T4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince</a>). It is amazing to see her breadth of skill as an actress to play the exuberant and feminine Chae Kyung in this and the tom boyish and awkward Go Eun Chan in Coffee Prince.

Prince Shin's father is sick (something the public doesn't know) in an effort to prepare the prince and the public for his impeding ascension to the throne it is decided the best PR move they can make is to marry him off.  Solidifying the monarchy and all that. He tries to get his secret girlfriend to marry him unsuccessfully, she wants to be a ballerina. This leaves him with the arranged marriage his grandfather set up. Lo! Who might that be but the klutzy Chae Kyung, who up until this point has only been a minor annoyance to Shin (She dumped dirty water all over his shoes--a bit of Cinderella reversal there and overheard his attempted proposal to ballerina girl).

Chae Kyung upon hearing what is in store for her refuses to agree to the marriage and can't understand why Shin would agree to it. Enter the plot device: parents that don't know how to handle their own money.  Chae Kyung concedes to the wedding when she and her family have to fight off mobster collection agency thugs (her dad clearly made some bad investments). If she sacrifices herself her family will be safe and solvent.

She has no idea what she is getting herself into though. It isn't just a wedding. She has to have princess lessons. And here is where I really wish I knew Korean, or at the very least there was a better way to subtitle their language in English.  English does not have the levels of formality that exist in Korean (or even in French). Relaxed common speech isn't allowed in the palace, but Chae Kyung has no experience speaking anything else.  Her relationships with Shin and other members of the royal family and the palace staff are represented in which level of formality her speech and theirs takes on.

As the wedding is taking place Shin's exiled cousin returns to Korea. Yul was the original crown prince, but due to scandal he and his mother were expelled from the country by the king (Shin and Yul's grandfather) effectively removing him from the line of succession. Yul is charismatic and instantly drawn to Chae Kyung.  At fist he keeps his relationship to the royal family a secret, allowing him to develop a friendship with Chae Kyung. In other words, he is Shin's exact opposite. Shin is stiff and often resentful of Chae Kyung. Yul is probably my favorite second male lead. He is set up to be the villain but it becomes obvious he is just as much of a pawn as the others, his years of exile and his bitter mother have given him better coping mechanisms when dealing with the politics of palace life than either Shin of Chae Kyung have.

Yul develops feelings for Chae Kyung at the same time Shin is melting towards his bride. Chae Kyung is blissfully unaware of both, but being as pure at heart as she is she clings to the hope that she and Shin can somehow make things work, if nothing else get along. Chae Kyung represents the kingship to both of them now, because her original betrothal was to Yul--as he was the original crown prince (and with his mother's nagging is slowly entering the ring to win his throne back). Both guys have a claim to her, but her marriage is to Shin.

There are a few really fun things in this series.  The primary one being Chae Kyung, she is fun and bubbly watching Yoon Eun Hye play her and comparing her work in Coffee Prince you can really see what a master of physicality she is. The wide shots that show her goofing off, say with a hula hoop do more to convey who Chae Kyung is than many scenes with dialogue.  Shin and his teddy bear Alfred (who has little still photos at the end of each episode, reenacting or foreshadowing key events of the story-- I'm guessing this is where&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mischievous-Kiss/dp/B004XJ4QIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mischievous Kiss</a>&nbsp;got the idea).  He is emotionally stunted and only really relates to the world through the bear on any emotional level, something that Chae Kyung comes to understand.  And Yul.

I did have to fast forward through scenes with Yul's evil mother after a while, I just didn't care about what she was doing, the politics of the story that were used as a contrivance to get the romantic triangle going really just aren't that interesting and their stakes aren't anything I am invested in.

Overall still worth watching, but it has its slow moments. It isn't my favorite, however, I still enjoyed it for the most part.",1325030400,,5142,4.7898305084745765
8228941,3,B000XPRMD0,"The premise of this Korean Drama is that Korea exists under a modern-day monarchy.  Because the King is ill, Prince Shin is required to marry while still in high school - although the marriage will not be consumated initially.  (So what is really the point in marrying him off this young???)  He has been dating a ballerina steadily for two years and they love each other.  However, she responds incredulously when he asks her to marry him.  She tells him that they are too young and that she has many dreams to fulfill as a ballerina.  By the time that she returns from her auditions, Prince Shin's marriage has already been announced.  He is to marry a commoner named Chae-Kyung, whose family is desperate for money.  Her Grandfather saved Shin's Grandfather - and as a result she has been promised to his Grandson (Prince Yool)in marriage since she was very young, but has been unaware of it.  However, this Prince Yool is forced to leave the palace when very young when his father dies and the engagement falls to Prince Shin.

First of all, Prince Shin is a jerk throughout the majority of this series.  I don't think he is going to change and I feel sorry for anyone who is married to him.  Second of all, Chae-Kyung is really immature for being 19-yrs. old.  I get that she is a free spirit, but it has her sucking her thumb in her sleep, etc.

The nicest guy of the bunch was Prince Yool.  I have never rooted for someone as much to ""get the girl.""",1323475200,,1456,4.441509433962264
8228942,5,B000XPRMD0,"Palace stars the same actress as Coffee Prince, but you'd never guess it. She is amazing as a totally different character. Also, the actor who played the new Princess's dad is Oh Ha Ni's dad from Mischievious Kiss. Actually, all the actors are pretty amazing. It's a bit of a cinderella story, except cinderella and the prince are married but don't really like each other for about 10 episodes. It's a classic kdrama with love triangles/squares and misunderstandings. Near the end, the drama gets really intense and I'll admit I cried.  The best part about the DVD Set is the Special Features with cast. I really enjoyed the long talk show featurette.",1322006400,3,651,4.8125
