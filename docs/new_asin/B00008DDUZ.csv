1835464,4,B00008DDUZ,"Yes they made a follow up to the not very like Dracula 2000, but there was enough of a fan basis that they did so.  The edn result is two parter that gets off the a surprisngly good start.
At the end of Dracula 2000, Dracula is hanging underneath a cross burning in the morning sun.  After his body is exstinguished he is taken to a local morgue where some medical students discover that the body is that of Draculas.  In the meantime a Vampire Hunter who works for the Catholic church (Think John Carpenters Vampires for a moment) is out to retrive and destroy the body.  However a mysteriouse benefactor claims it first.
The story is actually a good start to the followup and actually has a strong cast to support it.  With star Power like Craig Sheifer (Hellraiser Inferno) Jason Scott Lee (Dragon the Bruce Lee Story) and Roy Schneider (JAws) this chapter in the series is surprisngly entertaining and with a certain flair that makes one forgive the fairly laughable Dracula 2000.",1055376000,,984,4.6
1835465,4,B00008DDUZ,"After viewing a screener copy of 'Dracula: Ascension' (sequel to Dracula 2000), I decided to get on my computer and preorder a copy of the DVD (which I've heard should have at least an entertaining commentary track, among it's extras!).
The film is a direct sequel to 'Dracula 2000' and pretty much takes up where the other film left off, with Dracula hung burning from a cross.  There is a switch of burned bodies at the morgue and before long the blood-sucker is back alive and kicking.  What follows is an escalating series of action packed scenes that seem to draw the characters closer and closer to their ultimate demise.  I was never left waiting for the action to start back up.  The whole thing ends in a super cliff-hanger that leaves you awaiting the release of Dracula: Legacy. (Part 3, which I believe was filmed at the same time as Part 2, on location in Romania. The land of Vampires!).
There is ample blood-shed and severed heads, supplied once again by Gary Tunnicliffe (FX guy from Dracula 2000!).  Jason Scott Lee puts in a good turn as an awsome priest/vampire hunter, loaded up with cool weapons.  At last a return of the 'vampire hunters' of the past, yet this one has a twist (Perhaps we'll see more of him in part 3)! The rest of the cast puts in some pretty good performances with a few stand out supporting roles (John Light as 'the Money' or comedy relief, Khary Peyton as 'normal guy' turned psycho and Steve Billington as a really creepy Dracula).  Also, look for a cameo by Roy Schieder!  (Too bad it couldn't have been more than a cameo...)
This movie was well made and carefully crafted by many of the same people who did the original Dracula 2000.  I can't help but feel that if only the budget were higher, then perhaps this film could have expanded on and fleshed out many of its ideas and perhaps have been a 5 star film.  Even then, I'm not sure why this one never made it to theaters.  Don't miss it, especially if you are a fan of Dracula 2000!",1051488000,11,1983,4.4502762430939224
1835466,1,B00008DDUZ,"First off, let me say that I loved Dracula 2000. I saw it twice in the theater and bought it as soon as it was released on DVD, so when I heard that the D2K team of Patrick Lussier (director) and Joel Soisson (screenwriter) were filming a sequel I was anxious for the result.
As luck would have it we got an advance screener copy of Dracula II: Ascension where I work, so here's my review:
The first sign of trouble was when they contradicted the end of the first movie within 15 minutes of the new film. Dracula's remains are not taken back to London by Lucy Van Helsing, but left hanging from the cross. His body is then taken to a local morgue where the attendants too quickly learn and too readilly accept the fact that it is a vampire corpse.
The film goes downhill from there. There's mediocre acting from some of the cast, who only have uninteresting stock characters to work with anyway and Dracula himself is reduced to little more than a prop for the story.
The script is devoid of any originality or suspense that was present in D2K and even the look of the film itself is bland and colorless with the majority of the movie shot in 1) the morgue, 2)an abandoned mansion, and 3) and abandoned indoor swimming pool.
I know this was a made-for-video sequel, but low budget doesn't have to mean low quality (check out the excellent Canadian-made werewolf film ""Ginger Snaps"" if you need proof.) If you need a Dracula fix then re-watch Dracula 2000 or if you must see this one then find it for rental.",1045094400,10,1507,4.405017921146953
1835522,2,B00008DDUZ,"seriously this was no where near a sequel. The only reason you'd have any idea it was a sequel is that they found Dracula's corpse hanging from a cross on a roof on fire. You know where the last left off... everything that was set up is just mysteriously gone.

Hellsing's daughter that vowed to be the new keeper of the Body of Dracula because she gained the ""gift/curse"" from her father leeching Dracula's blood to stay alive all these years is not even mentioned. Then you got the guy who played Mowgli from the live action jungle book movie coming from absolutely nowhere as a one man tainted with vampirism warrior priest armed with weapons stolen from the Soul Caliber videogames.

At least if they made this a stand alone movie I'd have been able to go into it without overblown expectations.

AND WHAT THE HELL WAS THE DEAL WITH THE GUY WHO'S ENTIRE FACE ENDED UP A FANGED VAMPIRE MOUTH?!?",1289606400,,897,4.5246913580246915

1835524,3,B00008DDUZ,"Having not liked the original, Dracula 2000, very much I was a little iffy about seeing this sequel.  Although I did like the concept behind the entire series, people who have seen it know about the history of Dracula in this series.  The original made the movie out to be more of a childish game instead of an actual horror film.

Yet in this movie we find that they have decided to go into a new direction with the series.  Although the plot line is semi-obvious and most characters are one-dimensional there is still a uniqueness in the movie.

The lead female, Elizabeth, shows legitiment signs of intelligence and life to her.  Her acceptance to her new life at the end of the movie was quite surprisingly moving, emotionally speaking.  Not because the character was turned into a vampire but because the actress, Diane Neal, portrayed the humanity of the vampire.

Another great preformance by the cast was Jason Scott Lee, who played Father Uffizi.  He did a good job as the conflicted ""hero"" of the movie.  Definately an underrated actor to say the least.

Overall, I think this film could of had been a lot better if the other characters were not so one-dimensional.  If we, as the audience, were to feel something, anything for the other characters then the movie would of been 1,000 times better.

Yet that could of been blamed on the writers of the movie who didn't treat all the characters as individuals in a movie but as typical movie horror foder.  To bad,  this could of easily of been a 5 star movie.  But in the end it is a very solid 3 star movie for those who do enjoy a decently strong vampire flick.",1282694400,,1622,4.52233676975945
1835525,4,B00008DDUZ,"I just caught this on-demand after immensely enjoying Dracula 2000 some years back, so this is a very much belated review. There are many sources of the movie synopsis so I am not going to rehash that here.  The original was great with the goth punk rock theme, and incredible acting by a then-unrecognizable Gerard Butler.  This sequel again capitalizes on an excellent and under-recognized actor, this time Jason Scott Lee (excellent in his portrayal of Bruce Lee) to drive the story forward as a priest/vampire hunter named Fr. Ufizzi.  The race-neutral casting of Mr. Lee is novel even in this day and age and something that few ""minority"" actors have ever achieved (think Will Smith or Benicio Del Torro); I don't doubt that it was difficult for him to find non- stereotypic roles and I congratulate Mr. Lee on his excellent presence, acting and physicality in this movie.

The movie is for the most part very enjoyable.  However, perhaps the only criticism is that the actors playing the side characters were distractingly bad even for a b-movie. Diane Neal simply didn't have the credibility or star power to drive the story forward as the female lead.  Professor Lowell played by Craig Sheffer was even worse.  And as far as B-movies go, the eye candy, the impossibly beautiful Ms. Brande Roderick simply did not get enough screen time. Cinematography and editing by the romanian crew didn't approach the artistry of the british based first production.  Inexplicable heavy editing and censoring especially of the flashback sequences made for somewhat disjointed visuals at time.  Aside from that, it was an enjoyable mindless action horror movie.  Khary Payton was very enjoyable as a caricatured angry black man, and Stephen Billington was very enjoyable and certainly passable as a euro-gothic Count Dracula.",1268524800,,1818,5.070469798657718
1835526,3,B00008DDUZ,"While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-2000/dp/B00003CXSD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula 2000</a>&nbsp;didn't quite set the box office on fire, it did well enough to warrant a sequel - two, as a matter of fact. Released straight to video, ""Dracula II: Ascension"" (once again presented by Wes Craven) finds everyone's favorite bloodsucker in the custody of a group of med students, following the events of the first movie. When experimenting with his charred corpse in hopes of helping their crippled professor turns out to be a bad idea, all Hell breaks loose and things get rather nasty, as you would expect.

Director Patrick Lussier returns to the director's chair, and perhaps the biggest difference with this installment is its surprisingly restrained style. Less action packed and not as flashy in the visual department, the film is a more straight-up Dracula flick that gets its job done efficiently and in a timely manner. It also boasts a lot less star-power, in spite of a brief appearance by the late Roy Scheider. You'll spot a few C-list stars (Jason London, anyone?) but the big surprise is Jason Scott Lee, who plays a vampire hunter and virtually carries the film on his shoulders. It's a crime, then, that his character isn't given as much time as the over-dramatic students that drive the plot.

Of course, the film was shot back-to-back with the third sequel, and it shows. The thing that keeps it from being as good and as complete as it should is that too much time is spent setting up the next installment and not enough time giving the film enough meat and potatoes to stand alone. Also, it doesn't help that this version of Dracula (re-casted from Gerard Butler to Stephen Billington) is slightly neutered and isn't given much to do. If you can forgive its shortcomings, though, you'll find it to be a fair sequel that is at least a lot better than a lot of direct-to-video fare and serves as a decent enough way to whittle away 80 spare minutes.",1263254400,,2024,5.075075075075075
1835527,2,B00008DDUZ,"WES CRAVEN'S DRACULA 2000 was a movie that I watched....and fell asleep during. I loved the opening sequence where they broke into the vault looking for treasure and the fact that they made Dracula turn out to be Judas, a nice touch. But the rest of the movie seemed to be lacking something.

The same can be said for its sequel. For once the fact that it went straight to video holds true with most movies that do so.

The movie begins with Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee) tracking down a vampire while in Europe. He wins his battle but not without a cost. He is barely bitten, but enough to change him. Purging himself with a bath if pure sunlight, he is cleansed of all vampiric desires, but retains some of the powers they have.

We move to a university in New Orleans where a wheelchair bound professor Lowell (Craig Sheffer) is found talking to his students, one of which is apparently the love of his life. This student then goes to the morgue to work and asks for the help of her old boyfriend in processing the latest body brought in, the body of Dracula we saw burned to a crisp at the end of the first film.

Although the skin is charred, the insides of this corpse are different, all white and lacking of blood. As she checks for dental records, a fang pops and her finger is pricked. This drop of blood affects the body and her ex notices. Realizing what they have on hand here, he ends up with an offer from a mysterious benefactor for the body. They pair agree and help take it to the buyer's representative.

A few dead friends and a blood bath later and we discover that this body is indeed a vampire. Well, we already knew that. But now with one less set of hands, this group knows it as well. With the vampire shackled in silver chains under a set of ultraviolet lamps, he seems to be contained. Prof. Lowell is brought in to assist since his area of expertise seems to be related to blood and the search for regeneration of tissue techniques.

Before the films end, we will discover who the mysterious benefactor is, if the girl pricked by Drac's tooth succumbs to his evil ways and if good old Father Uffizi can come to the rescue at the last minute when it comes time for the inevitable final battle.

The movie plays well at times but for the most part tends to drag. Less scientific dissection of all around would lend itself to more movement on the part of the cast, an easily likeable group with no standouts save for Lee. Lee's combination of martial arts and demonic fighting seems to work when seen. It's just not seen often enough.

The end result is neither all that satisfying nor unpredictable. And the very end leaves it open for part III (and yes, I've read that it was made at the same time this one was shot). Wes Craven is a name to be respected in the genre of horror films. But for the most part, reply on it when he is directing, not just tacking his name on to another project.

And by the way....you may have noticed Roy Scheider on the cover of this one? His part is last all of about 2 minutes if that. Don't be fooled.",1205366400,,3064,4.314782608695652
1835528,3,B00008DDUZ,"I loved Dracula 2000.  Not that the director was breaking any new ground but he understood the erotic nature and cruptiontion of the ""Soul"" that Vampirisim represented.  On that foundation I was looking forward  to the film and it took a dogs age for it to be released and the third took even longer.

  I had to ignore the fact that in the theatrical leg of this trillogy Dracula was taken back to England by Mary Van Helseig.  I was thinking that would be the likly jumping off point for the next leg but this is not the case.  The Corpse of Dracula is retrieved by the police and taken to the New Orleans Mourge where Elizabeth is working.  Dark shadows of  future evil and mystery present themselves almost from that point on.

  She is wounded by one of the lifeless Counts Cannine teeth while examining and don't think this will not mean something down the line. It was a good device for this film that was almost entirly pushed asside in the second but it is used for great affect in the second.  Watching Elizabeth slowly change over the corse of the film is one of the more erotic parts of the DVD.

  Toss in her friends including a boyfriend dying of a devilitating illness along with the promise of a multi million dollar reward and the problems that come to a rise when a group of inexperianced science types trying to uncover the mysteries of this Corpse and how a bath in human blood brind it back to life and you have have set the stage for mass distruction and some  real gross out moments.

  Jason Scott Lee is the Vatican Vampire hunter who dispaches twin Vamp sisters in the opening and is hot on the trail of Dracula in all his forms and he and Dracula have a bloody and Metaphysical discussion to  end the DVD.

  There are familiuar actors in this film such as Dianne  Neil from ""Law and Order SVU"" and a breif cameo from Roy Schider from ""Jaws"" and ""Marathon Man"" to name a few.  I would not expect a super great film but I didn't feel like I blew my cash on this DVD and that is a good thing.",1171152000,,2018,4.2838196286472146
1835529,4,B00008DDUZ,"This first sequel to the fun Dracula 2000 is quite enjoyable. Sequels often fail to live up to the original, but Part 2 is interesting and entertaining. I liked it. 4 out of 5 stars!",1165881600,,182,4.228571428571429
1835530,2,B00008DDUZ,"Dracula 2 Ascension although not breaking any new ground is an entertaining enough vampire flick.

Jason Scott Lee played a cool enough vampire hunter, but his character just doesn't make any sense, are we supposed to believe that he just happens to show up at the tail end of events from ""Dracula 1""?

And please, no human being alive no matter what the reason or rationale would attempt to revive what they believe to be a ""dead"" vampire. Yeah sure, dropping the crispy count into the vat of blood was a good idea, but really, you don't try to revive a vampire under any circumstances, sorry, but that's just not credible.",1139875200,3,624,4.612612612612613
1835581,5,B00008DDUZ,"I recently watched all three of these movies (Dracula 2000, Dracula II, Dracula III: Legacy) and liked them all very much.
I'm not sure that II and III can be completely appreciated without seeing the other chapters but they all make for one of the best modern horror movie series.",1138838400,3,281,4.64
1835582,2,B00008DDUZ,"I saw 'Dracula 2000' (which this movie is the sequel to) and absolutely loved it, so naturally I rushed out to buy this movie, thinking it would be just as good. Boy, was I disappointed! Sadly, this had none of the dramatic tension and unpredictable plot twists of its predecessor. Instead, it was mostly predictable, clicheed and dull. No wonder none of the cast members from the previous movie wanted to sign up to do this one!

To give the cast of this movie credit, they tried hard. Craig Sheffer camped it up nicely as the evil professor, and Jason Scott Lee was impressive in the fight scenes. But given the script they had to work with, it was clearly an uphill battle. There were a few surprises in the script (like bringing up some little known but interesting facts about vampire folklore) but for the most part it was predictable and formulaic, right down to the location where it was filmed--I mean, it was set in an old, deserted gothic mansion. You don't get more clicheed than that in a vampire movie, unless it's actually shot in Transylvania!

I don't think I'll be bothering with seeing the sequel to this movie, the third in the series. My guess is that it'll be worthy of a 'straight to video' tag.",1127347200,4,1218,4.531818181818182
1835583,4,B00008DDUZ,"With the success of ""Dracula 2000"" it was surprising when Dimension Films chose to release the sequel ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" not to theaters, but Direct-to-DVD.  Since it was the same director from the first film, Wes Craven was producing once again, and the cast was comprised of good actors (not necessarily A-list, but neither was the first films' stars), the decision just didn't seem to make much sense.  Now, I'm not sure if the decision to go Direct-to-DVD effected the storyline, or if the script had already been written to be one big script, spread out over two sequels.  Either way, it seemed odd, and I have to say I was skeptical about even watching ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" (though the two sequels were shot back-to-back, due to legal trouble for Dimension Films, ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" was released over a year before ""Dracula 3: Legacy"").  But, after watching ""Dracula 2000"" again, I decided I should at least give the second film a chance, after all with the same director and producer it should at least be as good a movie as the first.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by ""Dracula 2: Ascension"", it had a good, solid story, with strong acting (Dracula was played by a different person, in fact none of the original cast returned for the sequels), and continued to build on the new origins of this modern-day Dracula.

""Dracula 2: Ascension"" picks up pretty much where ""Dracula 2000"" left off.  Dracula appeared to have been killed, however, appearances can be deceiving, as Dracula is once again alive and well.  This time though his freedom will be short lived as he is captured by a team of scientists who are attempting to find the key to immortality, a secret that is locked within Dracula's blood.  On the trail of Dracula and the team of scientists, is a priest/vampire hunter, named Father Uffizzi (Jason Scott Lee), that has been assigned by the Catholic Church to destroy Dracula and his legion of vampires.  When Uffizzi catches up with the scientists he discovers that Dracula was more than they could handle.  Now with most of the team dead, except for two members, one that has been turned into a vampire, the other named Luke (Jason London), joins forces with Father Uffizzi, to destroy Dracula and attempt to save his friend from the vampirism that has taken hold.

""Dracula 2: Ascension"" was an entertaining sequel, yet somewhat disappointing due to the fact that the story for this film flows directly into the third movie making both films feel like one big movie.  Unlike ""Dracula 2000"" which could stand alone as a complete movie, ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" requires the audience to see ""Dracula 3: Legacy"" to get some form of satisfactory ending.  After watching ""Dracula 2: Ascension"", I felt like I did after the first two `Lord of the Rings' films, they were great movies, yet they never had satisfactory endings until the final movie.  Same here, this was a good movie, but it sucked that I had to wait over a year to get the conclusion of the new story arc that had begun in ""Dracula 2: Ascension"".

The gripe about the 2 sequels being so inter-linked aside, this really was an enjoyable film and a satisfying continuation of ""Dracula 2000"".  The cast, though comprised mostly of unknowns, was for the most part strong, and the story when combined with the third film is really intriguing.  If you liked ""Dracula 2000"" or are a fan of vampire or monster movies, then I highly recommend this series of films.

""Dracula 2: Ascension"" is rated R for violence and language.",1121731200,12,3515,4.761120263591433

When Dracula II was released, I didn't hesitate to rent it and watch it. Again, I was pleased with the results, another mostly original idea. I mean, there are only so many ways you can spin a vampire story. I definitely recommend Dracula II and the upcoming Dracula III.",1119657600,5,432,4.684210526315789
1835585,5,B00008DDUZ,"The reviewer who sees this as ""hate-inspiring"" is taking this a little too seriously. As a previous reviewer pointed out, supernatural beings in folklore are often endowed with some kind of activity they thrive upon be it counting things, drinking blood, eating people, hoarding gold, fixing shoes, etcetera. I don't think Dracula II was trying to pick on people with any kind of illness at all. The pale skin is often a trait of vampires because it's symbolic of them being ""dark"" and ""unholy"" creatures. That doesn't mean the makers of this film were saying anything about people who have health issues. Dracula II is a solid *fantasy* sequel that should be appreciated on that level.",1113264000,5,686,4.922413793103448
1835586,5,B00008DDUZ,"I know this was a really bad movie to many people, but I can't bring myself to erase it from my Tivo, and there are so many things I love about it that I had to give it 5 stars.

The first thing you need to know about this movie is that it isn't much of a sequel.  All it really keeps from Dracula 2000 is the mythology around the creation of Dracula.  To me, the whole Judas as Dracula thing is a fascinating idea because the blood drinking of Christians (and giving eternal life through drinking blood) is a delicious bending of holy communion.  Dracula 2000 ends with Dracula locked up in Van Helsing's vault, but you just have to forget that and figure he was left hanging upside down on the cross at the end of 2000 (maybe the filmmakers were making this up as they went along).

The second thing, is that the actor playing Dracula has changed, which was fine with me because I thought Scott Billington was both scarier and more attractive in a menacing way than Gerard Butler.  The movie makes a clumsy attempt to explain this by saying each time Dracula regenerates, he changes form, but their reasoning doesn't really work unless you discount Dracula 2000, (where he always looked the same in flashbacks.)

Many people have complained that Dracula is tied to a cadaver chair for most of the movie, and he is, but Billington managed to make that work with his facial expressions--you could almost see what was going on in Dracula's head.  I actually liked it that Dracula wasn't all powerful through most of the movie--it seems like his ascension should take time and be at some cost, so seeing him suffer as a lab rat was somehow ""right"" with me.

So what did I love about this movie?  For starters, I enjoyed the way the mythology of Dracula II didn't stick to the hum drum and boring staples of vampire movies.  I liked the premise of a group trying to profit off of a vampire's blood; the group dynamics and how they fell apart were fascinating to watch, if not always realistic (I will admit a few plot twists were totally unbelievable, but I was willing to just go with it).  Mostly though, I love this movie because it has one of the best death scenes ever in it--one that was gruesome but funny, and oddly satisfying since the guy who got it was such a jerk.  Also, I have to admit that I really liked the ending.  I don't want to spoil it, but suffice it to say that I am pretty sick of Van Helsing-finally-stakes-the-vampire plots, and this one was different.

I have to admit that my taste in movies is a little oddball (two other vampire movies that I recently enjoyed were Immortality and Blood, indies that strayed from the traditional vampire mythos.)  I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but for people who like vampires, schlock, and something a little different, this movie would be a good bet.",1108771200,10,2828,4.483430799220273
1835587,4,B00008DDUZ,The actors casted as Dracula in this series have been superb! Some Gerard Butler fans may not be pleased with this one (he's not in it) but I liked Dracula II and I'm a big fan of Butler's work in Dracula 2000. He is a fine actor and he made a dashing Dracula. This time Dracula II gives us Stephen Billington in the role of Dracula and MY GOD IS HE CREEPY! I'd never heard of Butler before Dracula 2000 and never heard of Billington until Dracula II. Both are GREAT in these things. Where do they find these types of DYNAMIC actors? Both have brought new blood to the role and the way these movies are written allows for different actors to bring such different and dynamic interpretations of the character to each movie. I like that. The concept that Dracula has been various people through the ages (Gilles de Rais to name just one)makes these films a little different from other Dracula films. Jason Scott Lee is another example of dynamic casting and I look forward to learning more about him in the next one.

I know that it is the sequel to Dracula 2000, so i really shouldn't have expected much from it.  Dracula 2000 would have made an excellent movie if it had stuck to the original Dracula story by Bram Stoker, because it is such a great story and it would have been awesome to see the story in take place during modern times.  This film shouldn't even have the name dracula in it because it strayed so far from the story.

1835590,5,B00008DDUZ,Dracula II has an obviously lower budget and a cliffhanger ending that will earn it some unfair criticisms. I don't judge people or movies strictly by how much cash they have and what impressed the hell out of me is how Patrick Lussier's vision of Dracula shines through regardless of the budget limitations of this direct to video sequel. There have been far too many Dracula films that failed to bring anything engaging to the character's mythos but this director has brought something new to the table TWICE. That's no easy feat. The cliff-hanger ending has me on the edge of my seat and that's not bad at all for a direct to video sequel. What this one lacks in money it makes up for with a tighter story. The commentary is a hell of a lot of fun too. These help to earn this already excellent flick the highest rating I can give. The maker of these films has one hell of a story to tell and I'm eager to see where he's taking us.

Seems like Gerard Butler made a wise choice in not doing this movie and it seems like Dracula stold his hairdo from Billy Idol while in the process, and Stephen Billington is in his shoes. People say Billington did a much better job at Dracula then Butler but that's a load of crock. All Billington did was get chained up and spew corny one liners. A wasted cast includes a stiff Jason Scott Lee (Soldier) who stands in one position, Diane Neal (Tv's Law and Order SVU), a groggy Craig Sheffer (Fire In The Sky) doing wheelchair wheelies, Brande Roderick (Starsky & Hutch), Roy Scheider (Jaws) in a pointless bit, John Light and Jason London (Spent). The beginning was a horrible start and it just billed up to needless frothy conclusion with some crumby acting and bad writing. Patrick Lussier does not do it again because he cant capture what he did in the first one.

1835657,5,B00008DDUZ,"I really enjoyed Dracula 2. I was quite surprised to see it being given a low rating for various reasons including it being insensitive to albinos. The idea that vampires are sensitive to light, or weaker in the light, is not intended to be an attack on albinos. It's meant to make them scary because creatures of the night who hunt their prey in the dark are great stuff for scary stories. These type of night creatures can see in the dark. Humans can't. Humans have always been afraid of the unknown and of what might be lurking in the dark. Vampires also have a more human appearance and a more vampiric appearance. The more vampiric appearance looks more corpse like and bloodless. This is in no way an attack on albinos. Vampires (like other magical creatures in legends) also have cumpulsions that drive them. It could be drinking human blood, making or repairing shoes, exchanging money for human teeth, counting things, collecting treasure, eating people, etcetera, but it has to be something extreme since magical creatures in these extreme stories are often extreme characters in some way. Having these type of ideas featured in a modern film is in no way an attack on people with compulsive disorder. Maybe folks who live in the country should be offended that Leatherface does too? Here's an idea: why don't we just enjoy movies like Dracula 2 and not try to be soo serious about them? Sounds good to me.",1093478400,3,1416,4.713709677419355

It still looks impressive for direct to video and ""eye candy"" isn't that important to me. Heart is improtant to me. This flick has plenty of it. Imagination is important to me.

1835659,3,B00008DDUZ,"Not only do you need to know that this direct to video movie is a sequel to ""Dracula 2000,"" but that it is now the middle part of a trilogy that concludes this year with ""Dracula III: The Legacy.""  Otherwise when you get to the ""to be continued"" ending you might feel cheated that you are left hanging just as things are starting to get interesting.  But then for most of ""Dracula II: Ascension"" it is not really clear why this 2003 film is a sequel to what is now the original in all this.

In director Patrick Lussier's ""Dracula 2000"" the new twist on the story of Dracula is that we finally learn the real reason why the vampire loathes Christian symbols.  It turns out that Dracula is really Judas Iscariot (you have to admit, it is an audacious idea even if it is rather ludicrous).  However, this great revelation has almost nothing to do with this story except for a few seconds towards the end.  This makes sense because except for Dracula's crisp corpse in the morgue most of this film has no reason to be tied to the first film.  Throughout the important thing is that these characters have stumbled across a real live vampire, so to speak, and the fact that this is the burned body of Dracula is as inconsequential as the idea he is really Judas as well.

So, Dracula's body shows up in the morgue and as Elizabeth Blaine (Diane Neal) and Luke (Jason London) do the autopsy they come up with the crazy idea that this is the body of a vampire.  Then something happens to convince them that they are correct in their suspicions, an idea that is reinforced when they suddenly get a phone call out of the blue from a mysterious stranger named Luke (John Light) offering $3 for the body.  Luke is interested in the money, but Elizabeth sees an opportunity for the vampire's blood to save her boyfriend Lowell (Craig Sheffer), who suffers from a degenerative condition.  Lowell brings along a pair of graduate assistants, Kenny (Khary Payton) and Tanya (Brande Roderick, Miss April 2000 for ""Playboy""), so that the can help investigate the scientific properties of vampire blood and, of course, eventually be the vampire's victims.

Meanwhile, Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee), an imposing vampire killer with a bullwhip and a wicked looking scythe, is going around decapitating the undead.  Dracula is next on his hit list, but his superior, Cardinal Siqueros (Roy Scheider) makes a point of telling Uffizi that he should not only be killing vampires but trying to save their souls.  Even though Uffizi is a priest, this idea has never occurred to him before, but you know about the hierarchical structure of the Catholic church, so this will come into play in the film's end game.

The idea of scientists playing Dr. Frankenstein with Dracula has its moments, although of course such efforts are doomed to fail.  At the same time ""Dracula II"" goes back to the ancient Eastern European superstitions that vampires have to untie knots and count scattered seed, a curious juxtaposition with the modern science and Judas elements of the story.  This also sets up some strange comic relief at the film's climactic moment, although I like the idea of which character of this strange little lot shows the most courage and intelligence in the face of a hungry vampire.

Another addition to the vampire idea Dracula insists that he has had many incarnations.  In addition to Vlad Tepes the names of Gilles de Rais and Caligula are thrown around.  This works with the idea that every time Dracula comes back he looks differently, which explains why the character was played by Gerald Butler in the original, Stephen Billington in this one, and is going to be Rutger Hauer in the finale (you can catch a glimpse of him in a flashforward during the flashbacks).  In other words, what could be an interesting idea with historical resonance, exploiting the whole Judas idea, ends up being an explanation for the casting in this trilogy.

There is a lot going on here in this film, although it is a mixed bag of hits and misses (and we have no idea why the title is ""Ascension"").  Lussier filmed both ""Dracula II"" and ""Dracula III"" at the same time, and in the finale Uffizi and a sidekick will travel to war torn Romania (where these movies were filmed) to try and finish off the vampire once and for all.  Perhaps the best thing I can say for this film is that I am interested in seeing how this all plays out.",1083196800,18,4403,4.629820051413882

With this, we get a kung fu priest, played with as little emotion as possible by Jason Scott Lee; we get a wacko professor played with constrained malice by Craig Sheffer; a Dracula with no pizzazz, no power, only albino-like features; and a supporting cast of actors seemingly pulled from other bad b movies.  Shame on writers Joel Sassoon and Patrick Lussier for forgetting what made their previous effort worthwhile:  a good cast and some fresh innovations on the vampire legend.  This one with its notion that vampires must untie all knots and count pebbles is so far out, it's goofy.
I won't venture into the third of this series, which features of all people RUTGER HAUER as the vampire.  This is one where there should have been no sequels!!!",1078531200,,882,4.814569536423841
1835663,2,B00008DDUZ,"Dracula II: Ascension, meets many B-movie sequel standards. Is the plot only slightly related to the first movie? Check. The story picks up where the first left off, and seems to have no real connection to the original. A mention of the how Drac was found and a brief flashback sequence are all that tie this film to the first. The plot itself is weak, with none of the characters (except Lee and to a lesser extent Jason London as Luke) are interesting or even likeable.
Is there a B-movie star just there for the paycheck? Double check! Roy Scheider sleeps through a cameo and Jason Scott Lee outclasses his fellow cast members with ease. Lee is the entire reason to see this film but even he can't save it from mediocrity.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about this sequel is the fact that Drac looks nothing like he did in Dracula 2000. At all. There is some passing mention about how he can change forms with each incarnation, but I didn't realize that he was in the same classs as Dr. Who, James Bond, and Darrin Stephens.
And then there's the ending. The ending of a film can make or break it. I'd love to tell you about how the ending was, but I'm afraid there isn't one. Sure, there's a final scene before the credit roll, but it isn't an ending. It is, however, a rather open ended link to the third film (unreleased as of this writing). Perhaps when the third film rolls around and they can be watched in conjunction, the overall ""watchableness"" of the film will increase.
Overall, the film is a jumble. Some homage is paid to the classical vampire myths, and it's perhaps the smartest moments of the film. But the overall plot, characters, and lack of any real connection to the first movie, make this a weak film and a weaker sequel. Despite this, there was promise in this film, enough that I will see the third movie, in hopes that the promise will be fulfilled.",1075075200,2,1880,4.468023255813954
1835664,1,B00008DDUZ,"Dimention Films gives a direct sequel to ""Dracula 2000"" (or ""2001"" depending on the place you live in), and this ""Dracula II: Ascention"" was shot in Romania, back-to-back, with another sequel ""Dracula III: Legacy"" (the title at the time of writing this).  Maybe I have to wait for this ""III"" before reviewing ""II,"" but as far as this one is concerned, I was hugely disappointed with the result.
The plot starts where exactly the original left, so if you have not seen it, you might have some trouble.  But the premise is simple: it's about one heavily burnt dead body, and medical students ala ""Flatliners,"" led by Professor Lowell (Craig Sheffer).  Perhaps you do not want to know more about it, so I only add that Jason Scott Lee appears as the star of the film, but his role is a bit surprisng one.  And Roy Scheider is nothing but a cameo (and miscast).  You also see Jason London, Stephen Billington, and Diane Neal.
The story is nothing original, especially when you saw the first one, so I won't write about it.  I only point out that I had tough time following the plot.  The film is not good at presenting the chracaters' motives or the situation they are in.  In short, what they want to do is not clear from the beginning, and the outcome of the set-pieces are too obvious.
Moreover, the film fails to use the good location of the place, for many of the events happen inside the house such as disused swimmingpool.  The director Patrick Lussier takes too much time to reach the final battle, and the fighting itself is not convincingly done.
Maybe I am too harsh about it, but I hope the next one is better than that.  At least, some of the actors who did better jobs (you will know it in the film) seem to be coming back.  Let's hope they are as good as Omar Epps in ""Dracula 2000.""",1073692800,,1794,4.422492401215806

1835716,3,B00008DDUZ,"... There were so many problems I have with this movie...
Like for starters, does someone want to explain WHY the sequel had NOTHING in common with the original, other then the fact that Drac was in it?  How can you be a sequel if you don't--sequel??
And why was Dracula tied up the whole ... movie?  I mean gosh, it was bad enough they made him look [bad], ... but did you have to render the poor boy helpless?
And what LAUNGAUGE was he specking anyway? ... Cause I promise, with the exception of maybe five sentences, I couldn't understand a word he said.  Shouldn't there have been subtitles at the bottom of the screen for stuff like that?
And I do believe, besides Dracula, not one vampire lasted more then five minutes out of the whole movie.  ...
But just so you won't turn your nose up at the entire movie:  It really was sort of fun.  The priest (aka the Vampire Slayer) was really tight, what with the no nonesense additute and the way he used his weapons.  He practically dominated when it came to the few fight scenes, which becuase of the statement above, didn't last that long.
I gotta say, the twist and turns in the storyline were awsome as well, but not to spoil the fun, I won't say what they are.
And although Dracula looked rather...eewwsh...in the movie, there was this ONE SHINING MOMENT where he got to see him without all the dried blood, and wounds, and a little more color on his face...and MAN WAS HE HOT. ...
And okay, so Dracula AGAIN doesn't talk that much and yeah, so most of his conversations are in some off laungauge I'm to lazy to go translate: any of the moments he DID speak and that were understandable english words were either too cute or quite funny: he had a ... type of sarcasm, what with the smirking and laughing at other's misfortune...
And the damsel this time, although slightly 'stupid' is more entertaining to watch then Van Helsing's daughter in the first flick.
So pretty much, although there are some bad points, the good points which accure WHILE the points maybe/maybe not happening are good enough to make this movie watchable...that and to me, it's better then the first.
More gore...more fun...actually more exciting to watch, just the priest alone made that possible...and although he was tied up most of the movie (well actually, the entire movie except the ending) ...
And so you ask: Why then, the 3 stars?
For this, and this reason alone: THE ENDING.  I'm just going to warn you as of now: DO NOT WATCH THE ENDING. It will ONLY make you irriated and highly upset unless the 3rd installment is already out by the time you've seen it.  TRUST ME.  The ending alone is enough to make me give this 1 star, but due to the movie's superiority, and the fact that the scenes for the ending are a hoot...I'll give it 3 stars.
All and all, this is watch worthy if you are:
1. A Wes Craven fan.
2. A Dracula/Vampier Movie Fan
3. Saw Dracula 2000 and wants to the sequel.  (Note: The only reference it makes to D2000 is at the beginning with him still burning on the cross...which contridicts the ending to D2000 seeing as it seemed V. H.'s daughter put him back in the coffin and sealed him away.)
4. Really have a lot a time on your hands and just happen to see the case in your local Blockbuster and think it looks rahter interesting....
And on that note, I hope you enjoyed: but I do suggest you RENTING the movie first BEFORE you spend you good hard earned money to buy it...

1835717,5,B00008DDUZ,"Dracula II: Ascension is one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen.
It takes place after the Mardi Gras celebration that is at the end of Dracula 2000.  A couple of medical students find a burning body hanging from a cross at dawn.
While performing the autopsy, the character of Elizabeth cuts her finger on one of Dracula's teeth, specifically one of his fangs.  She thinks nothing of it as she cleans the wound with some alcohol and puts a bandage on it.  When she and the character of Luke realise just what they are dealing with, they take the body of the vampire and smuggle it out of the morgue while substituting another burn victim to pose as the vampire body.
A priest/vampire hunter from The Vatican is on the trail of Luke and Elizabeth as they race to the abandoned home of their teacher's parents.  The teacher, Lowell, and Elizabeth are a couple at the begining of the movie and by the end, because of the bite on her finger, Elizabeth turns vampire and stays with Dracula.
Meanwhile, Lowell, Kenny (another student), Eric (Lowell's old college buddy) and nearly everyone else has turned vampire and found themselves victims of the vampire hunter from The Vatican.
This movie also falls back on some of the old legends that have to do with the Dracul family of Romania and another famous vampire of that time: Elizabeth Bathory.

It had attitude, a gory finesse, and was chock full of adrenaline to get your blood pumping.  It wasn't the best, nor was it the worst, and you could almost take it seriously as a contributor to the vampire genre.  Unfortunately in this straight-to-video sequel, Dracula (Judas Iscariot, cursed for eternity) is left for most of the movie in chains and is merely a device with which to move a mediocre script with a mediocre cast along.
The film offers little in the way of suspense, with actors with no foundation acting in random ways.  The script could have been compiled by a program on computer taking various vampire scripts, frankenstein, and other scream flicks in equal consideration.  The editing also was poorly done with jarring shifts from scene to scene, as if no segue or cross fade was ever considered.  It is truly a laughable effort.  But, in this respect, I had a fun time watching it.
I'm sure most people interested in this movie know what kind of movie they're getting into with Wes Craven--we're not looking for Oscar worthy anything, and if you sit back and laugh at it and not take it seriously, you can have a great time poking fun at it with your friends.  The hunter character played by Jason Scott Lee was decent, and with more thorough development, could possibly carry his own movie.  Unfortunately for us, we will have to wait for the third (and hopefully better made) installment of this series to see how it plays out.  I'm not sure if I will be interested by then, though.

1835723,3,B00008DDUZ,"""Dracula II,"" sequel to Dimension's holiday bomb ""Dracula 2000,"" is the second installment in a planned trilogy about the king of all vampires (who also happens to be Judas, betrayer of Christ in the film's mythos), and despite its straight-to-video origins, it's actually a decent foray into the blood and fangs genre. Now, that doesn't mean it's for everyone, much like its (superior but flawed) predecessor, but if you are into vampire films with a sense of humor, this may fit the bill.
The plotline revolves around a band of medical school students who discover the severely immolated corpse of Dracula, and decide to sell it for a hefty sum to a mysterious figure who telephones them early on. Why do horror films always exhibit main characters with really, really bad ideas? At any rate, it all goes wrong in short order. Dissension in the group, betrayal, a priestly vampire hunter, and Dracula himself all serve to make things a little bumpy for the conspirators.
The film's greatest strength lies in its rather macabre sense of humor, and provides an interesting take on Bram Stoker's beast. Unfortunately, there are more holes in the plotline than in a vampire-ravaged throat. Characters behave inconsistently at best. On top of that, if you're a fan of ""Dracula 2000,"" don't expect this one to feel much like a follow-up, as the only returning character is Dracula himself (and he's had a major facelift). This is true despite returning director/writer Patrick Lussier and co-writer Joel Soisson. And, as one might expect in this instance, the original is superior, if only to a small extent.
The ideas aren't very original, but ""Dracula II"" is more entertaining than it should be. If you like vampire films, especially those which provide a healthy dose of camp, then by all means give this a look - and keep an eye open for ""Dracula III.""

They make the best Horror movies but, the don't make movies like they use to cause now & days there's to many restrictions on film making due to all the complaining, nagging parents who as teenagers themselves use to love the same thing.",1397174400,,329,4.593220338983051
7981692,1,B00008DDUZ,"If there was a vampire movie that did NOT need a sequel, it would be ""Dracula 2000.""

But since Hollywood cannot resist flogging a dead horse, ""Dracula 2000"" actually got TWO sequels that it didn't need. The bafflingly-named ""Dracula II: Ascension"" introduces a completely new cast of characters with no connection to the previous movie... including Dracula. Apparently vampires are Time Lords -- set one on fire, and he'll pop up later with an all-new face.

When a charred corpse is brought into a morgue, Elizabeth Blaine (Diane Neal) and her buddy Luke (Jason London) quickly discover that it is a vampire. How? A fang springs out and pricks Elizabeth's finger when she's prodding the mouth. Since her boyfriend Lowell (Craig Sheffer) is dying of a degenerative disease, they hope to come up with a cure-all derived from vampire... something.

So they take the charred corpse to a remote house, and soak it in a bathtub of blood. And who should pop up, partially renewed, than Dracula (now played by Stephen Billington) himself?

While the group ties Dracula up and bickers a lot, a vampire-slaying priest named Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee) is tracking them down. His goal is to first give Dracula absolution, then destroy him. However, the idiots who revived Dracula have no idea how dangerous he is, or how corruptive vampirism is -- and they also don't realize that the greatest dangers are from their own.

Except for the presence of Dracula (who isn't even played by the same person), this movie really doesn't have much in common with ""Dracula 2000."" It's pretty much a standard horror movie where a bunch of idiots congregate in a dangerous remote place, so they can die one by one. Also add a priest character who... doesn't really do much.

And admittedly it does have some nice touches, such as including the OCD qualities of traditional vampirism. And while Billington spends most of the movie tied to a table, he does have a lot of menacing, alluring presence even when covered in flour.

Unfortunately, that is about as far as it goes. Most of the movie is just a fetid regurgitation of the same old horror movie cliches -- a bunch of idiots hanging around a dangerous place, making stupid decisions. And the thin plot becomes even more nonsensical when one of the characters reveals his dastardly plan... which makes NO logical sense, because he was trying to trick people into giving him what they were going to give him anyway. Idiot.

Dracula is one of the few characters in this whole movie who is actually memorable, and Billington does a decent job making him actually menacing. He's also apparently a Time Lord, since now Dracula regenerates with a new body every time someone ""kills"" him.

Lee is the only other person who makes any impression, which is impressive since his character fails to do... anything, really. The rest of the cast is played by a bunch of supremely untalented actors, who fulfill pretty much all the cliched horror roles -- the Doomed Annoying Black Guy, the Doomed Annoying Blonde, the Supposedly Smart Vampire Groupie, the Eager Puppy Sidekick and the Obvious Villain. Each one is irritating and devoid of depth.

""Dracula II: Ascension"" is barely a sequel to ""Dracula 2000"" -- it could have been the sequel to any other movie where Dracula temporarily dies. Instead, it's an irritatingly shallow horror movie with a few pale virtues.",1368144000,,3389,4.8578856152513
7981693,1,B00008DDUZ,"Dracula II: Ascension is another addition to a long line of poorly-made Dracula movies with the attachment of several elements. Over time, Dracula has been physically depicted in numerous ways. Traditional Dracula is a pale-skinned man with short and slick black hair. In his various forms, however, Dracula's hair length has increased and become wavy (remember Leslie Nielson's absurdist take?) or decreased to baldness. In Dracula II - which is actually the sequel to Dracula 2000 and does not utilize its sequel's depiction - our favorite vampire is given yet another makeover. Somewhere during the burning of his crucified body, he has apparently contracted a second NIGHTMARISH disease: albinism. Though his eyes are still hypnotically multi-hued, Dracula's melanin-drained form is completely unnecessary and unhelpful to the story. The explanation offered in the story is that Dracula's physical appearance changes with each regeneration. This is obviously a poor excuse to throw an under-appreciated genetic disease into the mix, thus thickening his villainous status. Furthermore, Dracula II reveals that the vampire is cursed with the compulsion to count every grain of sand he comes across and untie every knot he finds (there is some history to this slander). These requirements he meets with supernatural ability when they become hindrances, but Dracula is nonetheless bound to perform.

As an oculocutaneous albino with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, I am supremely insulted to find Dracula himself added to the list of negative stereotypes with these unfavorably-depicted conditions. Like a vampire, I too am cursed by an aversion to direct sunlight, and I too must fulfill reoccurring impulses that may seem illogical. In the formulation of vampire mythology, it is likely that individuals with such conditions were exaggerated to absurdly mythic proportions, but that is not something I want to experience in modern times. Are people as superstitious today as a millennium ago, or have we achieved something better than childish scapegoatism? The MPAA rating for this movie is R for violence, language, and sexuality, but maybe enforcing prejudices should be granted its own category. I give this movie one star for encouraging barbaric and senseless hatred among my fellow men. If you have ever known an albino - oculocutaneous or otherwise - or obsessive-compulsive rice counters, support me in condemning such hate-inspiring filth.",1314230400,,2453,5.506631299734748
7981694,2,B00008DDUZ,"First, you have the formulamatic scenario of egghead scientist(s)/medical personnel finding a dangerous entity and opting to ""study it"" for scientific benefits! THAT hasn't been part of the cheesy movies from the fifties and onward has it!  Surely nothing will go wrong with the experiment...Oh, no!  But it does!  Color me surprised!

Second, when it does all go wonky, the group starts turning on each other!  Another derivative part of the story!  I didn't like ANY of the characters anyway...so kill each other - see if I care!  Six less stupid people around!

Third, let's throw in a mystery character....oh, let's see...I know!  An Asian vampire ass-kicking priest!  That's not weird and has totally NOTHING to do with the first film!

Fourth, let's explain the difference in the way the vampire looks from the first movie....his features change with ""each regeneration"".  How convenient.  They should have just asked Gerard Butler back.  Although, I'm sure after reading the script he would have said no.

Now...the kicker!  What DOES the vampire look like?  Very blond almost white hair.  English accent.  Sounds like....Spike from Buffy!  Still not convinced?  What does the vampire do when he thinks he has killed the 'slayer'?  He takes off the slayer's long black coat and puts it on himself!

This was a MISERABLE sequel to the first, clever movie!  As cheesy as it gets! Do not waste your time!",1309392000,,1408,4.995670995670996
7981695,1,B00008DDUZ,"This seriously hurts the Dracula myth.  Dracula is NOT Judas.  The very Dracula novel will tell you that he 'must be the Dracula who fought the Turks'.  That's Vlad the Impaler, born 1431 and died 1476.  NOT Judas.  And I find the attempt to justify Dracula's limitations to tie them to the Judas story to be flawed at best.  Okay, so he was paid in silver when he betrayed Jesus so he hates silver, he hates the sun because he tried to kill himself at dusk... O...kay... and he hates crosses because of Jesus being crucified (long held guilt?).  So how do we explain his aversion to Garlic?  They had Italian at the last supper?  Also I do NOT like the idea that Jesus would condemn anyone to be a vampire.  Jesus forgave Judas.  And why would he come to save humanity only to unleash the world's worst vampire on the Earth.  That's a Messiah who gave us Count Dracula?!  Some Messiah unleashing a monster on us. Thanks a lot!

The plot of this film is painfully predictable and there are far more interesting films about a vampire in medical captivity.  If you want to see that sort of plot a better low budget movie would be Demon Under Glass.  At least that one was intelligently done.",1308355200,,1189,4.410138248847926
