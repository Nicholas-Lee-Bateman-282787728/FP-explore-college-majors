4250338,3,B0042F7KPC,"Season 1 was great, but I have found in Season 2,  the shows are ""remakes"" using the same story line as  the American Season 2 of Law & Order.  I thought they might be a bit more inventive, and come up with new ideas.  Was disappointed, won't be getting Season 3.",1450224000,,263,4.098039215686274
4250339,4,B0042F7KPC,"I bought season 2 because season 1 was just too pricey.  I did not feel like I missed anything by not seeing season 1.  The stories stand up on their own.  Loved Jamie Bamber in Battlestar Galactica and have to say I was pleasantly surprised at his performance in this series.  I really don't have any complaints, just did not think it overall merited 5 stars.",1447718400,,360,4.409090909090909

4250342,4,B0042F7KPC,"Just to let you know that the story lines are the exact same as the American version, but set in England. If you are a Law & Order fan from the first couple of seasons, you will definitely recognize these story lines. I personally wished the plots would have been different from the American version, but otherwise, I am happy with this purchase. I think the UK version of Law & Order is just as interesting and well done as the American version.",1440892800,,446,4.385542168674699
4250343,4,B0042F7KPC,"Season 2 has many eps where you leave with your heart in your throat.  The Brits are not afraid to ""bring it"" like some American productions are. YES, the Brit Eps are American rewrites, but the Brits bring each story home to London in their own way. This set of actors and directors are far more enduring, believable and watchable than the equivalent Americans. And this is saying something, because the American crew is not at all bad, in fact they are very good, the Brits, however, are excellent!  Also, I should say Season 2 is a bit bolder than #1, especially the closing ep!",1440115200,,581,4.523809523809524

4250356,4,B0042F7KPC,Equal to the early Law and Order series. The only problem I had was they used the same story line in some episodes as the US version.

One thing to watch out for, the number of episodes in the Season, does not match the TV broadcast seasons, so if you have a set of some kind, be sure to check the actual episode titles before buying.

4250361,4,B0042F7KPC,Good British drama although as some earlier reviews indicated some shows seem to be taken directly from the original Law and Order.  Reason this reviewer gave set a 4 star rating is that although the menu of the disk show -closed captioning option the disk would not switch from no to yes so that the disk would display closed captioning.  Disk would also not display closed captioning using the DVD player button that normally will turn on closed captioning.,1400889600,,459,4.7974683544303796
4250362,5,B0042F7KPC,"i have season 1 so decided to get season 2. I find a very good dramatic show seems very true to life. I was looking forward to season 3. but read a review that it contained a number of season 2 shows how many? not very good anyway I would rather have
just the relevant shows be it 6 or 10 instead of 3 shows i've already seen the cuz",1400457600,,333,3.7714285714285714

4250368,5,B0042F7KPC,"I love the UK incarnation of Law and Order. It's a great addition to the franchise. They are taking classic storylines from the original series and re-working them to fit the UK legal system. Even on stories I remember, it's a great new twist that I discover in the plot. The acting is amazing and the team is a great cohesive unit.",1387238400,,332,4.370967741935484
4250369,3,B0042F7KPC,"Good plots but taken word for word from early L & O. So close I recognize the episode within minutes, I must surmise that L & O was not televised in the UK thus episodes were all 'new' to viewers and the plots in the early years were really good (I never saw this program when 1st aired as I was in college; my life was a study-a-thon w/ little time for TV but I sure became a L & O junkie after the first episode. My dad was an LAPD Sgt and this was and remains my favorite cop show; it actually has realistic detectives and is the only one which did a good job w/ delving into their personal lives without making that the center of attention. Unlike past programs such as NYPD Blue they actually worked without developing side-plots of half the staff becoming sexually involved with one another. Anyway back on track, the episodes are really good but taken pretty much verbatim from older episodes, a few are EXACTLY the same, some they had to tweak a bit in, say, having the perp use a knife rather than gun given the UK is not flooded w/ firearms & the judicial system titles. It's a good buy if you have never seen the early episodes in the US but if you have you will know the ending 5 minutes into the program.",1384992000,,1217,4.182978723404255
4250370,3,B0042F7KPC,"Law & Order UK Season two was not what I expected. I love British drama and some of their detective series, so I thought that that Law & Order UK would have an interesting twist on the criminal justice system. For the most part they recycled some of the storylines from the original Law & Order series but they didn't do them as well as the original series. I was also disappointed in the british equivalent of ""Jack McCoy"" and his boss. It has to be the writing because the ""district attorney"" who was in the series Wives and Daughters, was anemic in this role. In Wives and Daughters he displayed quite and acting range. That leads me to believe that this series was done as well as it could have been. It wasn't quite up to the standard of the British drama and detectives series that have enjoyed so much.",1384905600,,809,4.364238410596027
4250371,5,B0042F7KPC,I like this version as much as the USA based show.  The characters and stories really let you see how British legal system works.,1384041600,,129,4.375
4250372,4,B0042F7KPC,It is a good show....It is different in its own way. I just enjoy how the UK is different then the USA version.,1383782400,,111,3.869565217391304
4250373,3,B0042F7KPC,"It's good for British entertainment.  Although I love all of the Law & Order series, this is my least favorite.",1382659200,,111,4.55

4250375,4,B0042F7KPC,"Law and Order:UK (hereafter called L&O:UK) comes with a second season in classic British brevity with six episodes.  Fans of the original can tell which six of the classic series were adapted to London and the quirks of British law and government, easily.

But, the adaptation makes for an interesting set of differences-how the US (specifically New York) handles some crimes differs from how the UK handles the crimes-and the cast does very well in creating their own versions of the various iconic characters.

If you love British crime drams, this is a show for you.",1381622400,,569,4.90625
4250376,5,B0042F7KPC,"I believe season 2 was better than the first season. My husband and I like the fact that you really see the emotions of the victims more than the US Law & Order episodes. We are definitely fans of the UK series and are sitting on the edge of our seats to see Season 3.  Thank you, Amazon, for offering the used season 2 which was in perfect condition - there was not a smudge or hint of a scratch - and offering it for such a great price.",1373846400,,438,3.9213483146067416

4250381,5,B0042F7KPC,Great series and Great Charactors. Better than the Recent Law and Order shows in the US.  Recommend you watch Season One as well,1366070400,,128,4.565217391304348
4250382,1,B0042F7KPC,I thought  this would be something based on uk stories but unfortunately it was just a remake of the old law and order USA stories. Don't bother.,1363478400,3,145,4.37037037037037

4250384,5,B0042F7KPC,"We really like the characters, and the way in which they respond to violence - so much more shock and horror than in U.S. series.  This appears to be the last season, however.  Too bad.",1357257600,,185,4.257142857142857
4250385,5,B0042F7KPC,I Love L&O:SVU so I wasn't sure what to make oh L&O:UK. I Love Love Love it!  The creators have captured the original spirit of law and order and created a fantastic addition to the family.  A definite must for Law and Order fans.,1354492800,,230,4.204545454545454
4250386,5,B0042F7KPC,"I really enjoyed Season 1 of this series, so I purchased Season 2 as well. I do get BBC America and can view episodes on demand, but I find that the closed captioning is pretty spotty with that delivery system, and the rapid-fire English accented dialogue will lose you in a heartbeat if you are a poor Yank like me.
THe DVD Box set gives you several captioning options, and the captions are not intrusive . The series itself is a very interesting take on the regular L&O show most folks are used to. Since the justice system works a bit differently in the UK, you will get an inside look at another country's way of dealing with the investigation and prosecution of crimes. Plus,grown men in wigs? How neat is that?",1348185600,,716,4.431818181818182

4250388,5,B0042F7KPC,"Praise the Brits for a great adaption of the amazing Law and Order program.  Excellent view of the criminal justice system of another country.  The acting is superb by all the actors/actresses.  Our family first saw Jamie Bamber in the Hornblower series and have never been disappointed in his acting skills in his other programs.  I certainly hope there will be more of Law & Order UK to be purchased from Amazon.  This is a better price then at Target or other ""brick and mortar stores"".",1335484800,2,489,4.6395348837209305
4250389,5,B0042F7KPC,"Both seasons of Law & Order: UK have been a joy to watch.  Even when I remember the US episode UK is adapting, there's always a different twist given it.  Much is the same, especially in the format.  Each of the actors is also the same, but different. Bradley Walsh does the senior cop as a cross between Lennie Briscoe and your kindly grandfather;  Jamie Bamber's junior cop has much in common with Noth/Bratt/Martin/Sisto/Anderson, but adds a dash of idealism;  Ben Daniels as the senior prosecutor is so close to Sam Waterston it's scary; and Freema Argyeman as the junior prosecutor walks the tightrope between hard-nosed and empathetic. She's my second favorite (after Angie Harmon) of all in that role, US and UK.

And last, the theme music is different but still good -- more open with less blues influence than the US theme by Mike Post.

But you still get the hand-held camera look, still get the quick scene changes with the location given.

And yeah, the ""plunk, plunk"" is there.  Some things are non-negotiable!",1330646400,5,1023,4.767045454545454
4250390,5,B0042F7KPC,I was very anxious to see the UK's version of Law & Order and I must say I was not disappointed!! The UK's series was as dramatic & gripping as America's and I really enjoyed watching it. The lingo the British actors used was hard to grasp in the beginning but I learned to understand it immediately. I bought season I & II in 2011 & I can't hardly wait for season III on DVD to be published. I hated that Jamie Bamber's character of Matt Devlin was killed off the show .It was so well written & acted that it brought tears to my eyes. I am waiting not quite patiently I must add for what Law & Order UK will bring its US fans in 2012.,1328832000,2,635,3.96875

4250392,5,B0042F7KPC,Absolutely first rate TV entertainment. Every episode is a gem. I loved e US Law & Order and am now addicted to the British version.,1327622400,,132,4.32
4250393,5,B0042F7KPC,"Superior in every way to its U.S. Counterpart, this series is well acted. So many British shows have crossed the Atlantic to be adapted and have become not only inferior versions but cheap imitations of the original. Both seasons of this show indicate to us that a knock off need not be inferior. I think this show is better because the acting is more understated and not over the top. After I played the final episode, I had a feeling of loss that I would have to wait a couple of years until I had forgotten enough about it to warrant viewing again. Well worth the investment.",1324857600,,578,4.411214953271028
4250394,5,B0042F7KPC,"I really enjoyed the UK adption of these american stories, especially Annonymous and ID on Disc Two. I would agree a couple episodes slow, but perhaps I do not understand Great Britain and London culture very well. Certain things important there are not really taht important here. The acting is terrific. The legal system often different, and not just beacuse of the WIGS. CTV photraphs pretty standard in may public places. Not true in United States (?). Thank you.",1324771200,,467,4.924050632911392
4250395,5,B0042F7KPC,"L&O UK season II, is just as terrific as season one--maybe even better as we are getting to know just a little bit more about the 'coppers' and the lawyers. The 'familiar' Law and Order format of the show will sooth any fears yanks have about watching a British version of a crime show that lasted 20 years on US network TV. The old/young cops who do the investigation have a great chemistry and Ben Daniles as the lead prosocuter and his gorgeous assistant are compelleing also. There are enough 'differences' between US & British laws & courts to make this show seem 'fresh' and the stories are riviting & intense. And if somone thinks its just the Law & Order ""formula"" that makes this show so good and and the location & actors aren't that important, I'd direct you to the other recent L&O offering ""Law & Order Los Angeles"". That show has some great actors but the serries comes off as totally 'flat' and uninteresting and you can see why it got pulled after 1 seaon and the British version is still going. Trust me, if you like the original Law & Order, SVU, and Criminal Intent, you will LOVE this UK version.",1322352000,20,1116,4.4487804878048784
4250396,5,B0042F7KPC,"This series follows the pattern of the first season of Law and Order UK in that the plots come from the long running American series. The US episodes were searched for stories which would translate effectively into a UK setting - some of them would not transfer easily particularly with the UK justice system. I suppose there is a lot of US source material in that Law and Order was a very long running series, but you do wonder if they are planning to introduce some made for the UK scripts at some point in the future. However, having said that, my enjoyment of Law and Order UK was not really affected by the fact that I have probably viewed most of the American source programmes over the years and I only occasionally got a feeling of deja vu.

This time round we have 13 more episodes to add to the previous 13 from Season 1. Although originally intended as a single series, clearly this one will run and run. Fans of the series will be pleased that another 13 episodes have been commissioned to make up Season 3. There is some confusion as in the UK each series is either 6 or 7 episodes.  Hence Season 2 is Series 3 and 4 in the UK.  The stories all follow the same format in that they start with a police investigation of the crime and apprehension of the perpetrator and the second part is the court room case and outcome. The main focus is in solving the crimes and getting the conviction so we do not get a lot of personal detail about the characters which contrasts with some other police series.",1320883200,3,1509,4.343971631205674
