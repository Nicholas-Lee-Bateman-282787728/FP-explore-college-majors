1057883,3,6305650853,"Remember Kenny""BUD"", the neighbor/friend of the youngest Cosby on the Cosby show?  Well, he's grown up, and he's trippin... Trippin' was a cute little film about a high school senior named Craig(Kenny).  He is always day dreaming(or trippin') about a different life, a life so much better than what he has. His dreams are worth chuckling over, and there were some funny parts throughout the film.  It certainly wasn't a laughfest, but I thought it was a cute.",967593600,4,459,4.858974358974359

1058231,5,6305650853,It was a good movie if you can remember sitting in a  class and start to day dream about how you wish your life was going instead of the reality that you were in. I know I did the same kind of dreaming at times. It was not a great movie but had a lot of real good scenes and some good acting in it. Some of it maybe was a little over the top but what could you except. I enjoyed it and felt it was worth my investment in to it. Go ahead a see it if you never seen this movie it is worth a shot.,1344902400,,494,3.532110091743119
1058232,5,6305650853,"This Film isn't a comedic masterpiece, but it is funny nonetheless!
This film is light ,so the approaches that it makes aren't so in depth (Perhaps it can be due to low-budget) but they made it work. It doesn't have much character development but they get the point across. This movie come out in the peak of pre-college frat-boy films such as ''American Pie'',''Bring it on'' and ''Get Real'' but in it's urban turnout and hip-hop genre it was only proper to make one. Deon Richmond really makes this movie, he adds meat into the bones of the chuckling. Mostly because he is funny without much effort -  and Stoney Jackson adds a nice antagonistic humor to it just to balance the scale. Anyone can relate to this film - it starts out funny and it's tone gets mature withing it 3rd stage. Indicting that it's okay to have our heads in the clouds but our feet need to be planted on solid ground. A keeper nonetheless.",1310515200,,916,4.485029940119761

1058236,5,6305650853,"Maaaan, this movie had me hurting almost the whole time. It brought back many of my high school memories as a young teen making decisions and having dreams. A true comedy indeed. His ""trippin"" moments were hilarious and anyone who didn't like this film probably thought that the Nutty Professor and its boring sequel were funny.
  Pick this one up definately.",988761600,2,359,4.868852459016393
