Sure it doesn't show much sailing, but it does show you what cruising is all about.  See the world and enjoying the folks that live on it.  Very good quality and they have done an outstanding job on doing their homework on each place they anchor.  Highly recommended",1228953600,,406,4.4324324324324325
8036383,4,B00061J1YY,"The Shards do a great job showing what types of experiences you can have while cruising, more from the standpoint of being a world explorer and tourist than a sailor. They show what it is like to stand a watch and how they made some of their weather decisions, but there is not a lot of 'hands on boat technical stuff' in the series, so if thats what you are looking for there may be better sources. These videos seem to have been produced for a TV audience that essentially has little knowledge of the fact that someone could travel the world in a small sailboat and see lots of wonderful stuff and interact with other cultures. Sort of like a Sunday afternoon PBS show. Still, I have enjoyed watching the series several times and would definitely recommend it.",1116374400,3,762,4.489208633093525
8036384,5,B00061J1YY,"My husband and I are getting ready to sail to the Med this spring in our 43-foot sailboat. We've watched these DVDs several times in preparation for our journey, and they not only whet our appetite for what's ahead but give us confidence. We can do this! We're going to see these places! The DVDs are a great way to get ready to travel, whether you're sailing or not.

Paul and Sheryl do their research--they know the places to go, and provide interesting background on the places they visit. Can't wait for the next instllment in their continuing adventure.",1112054400,3,558,4.636363636363637
8036385,5,B00061J1YY,"This is a great series. The Shards take the viewer from Gibralter to Turkey the way a true cruiser does it. They give us the details sailors need to know. From proper anchoring techniques to shopping the local markets for the freshest foods. Not only post card vistas, but also windy days and rough passages. We meet both locals and other cruisers and experiance the interaction that takes place when people of different nations share a common bond. ""Distant Shores"" puts us in the boat with Paul and Sheryl Shard. Whether shipwreck diving in the Straits of Gibralter or searching for the out of the way wineries or hauling out the apply fresh bottom paint they talk to the viewer, never down to them. I have yet to come across a better series of sailing videos for the Mediterranean. I've watched them over and over and still learn something new everytime. I highly recommend this series.",1111276800,4,889,4.705128205128205
8036386,5,B00061J1YY,"This is not a dull history documentary film!

While having the winter blues, you will need the Distant Shores DVDs to warm your heart.  The Shards, a young couple, who built their own sailboat, set out to sail the oceans.  In their refreshing film making style they take you along to uncommon and interesting places of the Mediterranean Sea.  Spiced with camel riding through the desert, fighting off persistent bugs, sweating in a volcanic cave, or driving a three-wheeled mini car to visit a winery.

Good inside information, good cruising tips, plus real life entertainment.

A good bang for the buck!",1104883200,3,604,4.930693069306931
8036387,5,B00061J1YY,"The Shards have filmed a very unique journey across the Mediterranean Sea.  We are given insigthts and perspective few will ever enjoy.  From the monkeys on Gibraltar to the markets of Turkey we are introduced to fascinating people and their lands and shorelines.  This DVD set is an entertaining and informative blend of small craft sailing skills, curiousity of new cultures and ingenuous filmmaking. I have limited expereience chartering three times for one week each in various parts of the Med and concur that these DVD's truly capture the opportunity to interact with the real Europeans and share in their lives and cultures off and on the water.  It brought back great memories for me and will help others build dreams for their future.

Paul and Sheryl Shard are the stars of this multi-volume odyssey.  They built the boat, they sail the boat, they share it all with us.  They are real people without rehearsal or production crew. They leave us with the feeling that ""I can go there"" or ""I can do that"".",1104883200,5,1012,4.781609195402299
