5072578,4,B007ATC11U,"Interesting to a point. One gets to witness the cities of Cuba, but I know that Cuba possess some of the most beautiful beaches and great fishing, things that were not covered much, if at all. Things are changing and maybe, there will be an up-dated DVD in the future. Love the island and its people.",1426550400,3,300,4.375

5072581,5,B007ATC11U,"i really enjoyed this travelogue of Cuba which covers most of the island's cities, towns and countryside.

As I was unable to find similar programs by Rudy Maxxa or Rick Steves so I purchased this one and I was pleasantly surprised. The delivery is more casual than that adopter by Rudy or Rick which seems appropriate for the tropical isle of Cuba.

I hope that Martin Darrah will produce more such programs for us all to enjoy.

I show these travelogues to my graduate students to show them the culture food languages and geography of these far away places and hopefully kindle their interest to travel and explore our wonderful world.

5072585,5,B007ATC11U,"I LOVED IT!!
One of the best Cuba DVD / Docu's I have seen in a long time.
Not just the Big Cities with all the wonderful Architecture, but also driving through Cuba on the back roads.
Tips on saving money, staying at peoples homes along the way, kind of ""B&B"" style.
Loved this DVD!",1367884800,8,283,4.163636363636364
5072586,4,B007ATC11U,"The expectator is transported through the most important places of Cuba and, at the same time, is given to him the opportunity to know the history and culture of many interesting cuban cities.  To people who intend to visist the island is a good lesson about those beautiful landscapes.  The documentary shows many peculiarities about the people and place we know as Cuba, it has a very good narrative, several hints about how to spend less money when visiting some localities there and a superb guide of how to come closer to the heart of the people who proudly live in that island.",1361750400,10,583,4.650485436893204
8513520,4,B007ATC11U,"Cuba is the place time forgot--I'd say this recording is very current but nothing new has been built for decades!  I appreciated the history and quality information that accompanied the tour.  I would say this is a bit long in that we ""visited"" practically every town in Cuba.  I feel satisfied after watching that I ""have been to Cuba.""",1516752000,,337,4.677966101694915

8513522,1,B007ATC11U,pedestrian and pompous with a western bias and narrated from a place of privilege. better off seeing films like those produced by ICAIC not this rubbish,1497225600,,152,4.884615384615385

8513527,4,B007ATC11U,This video is very interesting.  It touched on the vibe of Cuba and the cuban people.  If you are looking for in depth tourist info or history this would not be for you but if you are looking for the flavor of the island you will enjoy it.,1436486400,,239,3.9583333333333335
