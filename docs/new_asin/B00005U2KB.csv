parents to know that yes these dvds are both educational
and entertaining. My twins' favorite and Mom's idea of time
well spent. By the way I also learned and enjoyed watching
all three DVDs.",1018310400,,247,4.391304347826087
1663392,5,B00005U2KB,I have a son who has learned so much from the There goes a... series.  I was very pleased to find out the series is now being released on DVD.  I already own many in the series on video. Now that I have a DVD player I am looking forward to purchasing the rest of the series I do not have on DVD. My son is absolutely enamored with Dave and likes to pretend he is Dave when he plays with his cars and trucks.  It is also the most popular birthday party gift I buy for my sons friends.  It makes an ideal gift. Thanks to the people at Theres goes a ... series for creating what I feel are the best childrens videos on the market.  We look forward too more new title's in the future.,1017792000,5,680,3.898550724637681

1663405,5,B00005U2KB,I purchased this for my 3 year old because he loves trucks and I loved this series as a child. We just took a 26 hour road trip across four states and this was the DVD that my son watched the most. He happily kept asking to watch it again and again. Definitely a must buy regardless of if your child is a boy or a girl!,1406419200,,319,3.7761194029850746

1663411,5,B00005U2KB,this is my grandsons' (2 & 4) favorite video.  The little one is so obsessed with garbage he threw away the first one he had.  Then he was inconlable.  I wondered if I'd find another one.  Needless to say they are delighted and it plays over and over and over again.,1303776000,,266,4.1568627450980395
1663412,1,B00005U2KB,"I am absolutely horrified that my two and a half year old watched this video! The actor, Dave, is incredibly rude to his friend, Becky throughout the video and even shakes his finger in her face, yells at her, grabs things from her, throws her in the garbage can (twice). I am actually amazed they are marketing this video to children. It's terrible. Don't waste your money. Amazon, please remove this from your selection!",1259884800,4,422,4.716216216216216

1663414,4,B00005U2KB,"since there are 3 episodes on one disc i definitely felt i got my money's worth.  at first my 2 yr old son was only interested in the garbage truck episode, which is really great - entertaining, funny, & informative.  we watched it several times a day, often in a row!  now he will watch the other episodes as well, although they are not as engaging for him bc they have a lot more information and less action.",1243209600,,410,4.230769230769231

The sender did send an email to tell me what happened after I was asked for a review and said I'd review it if it ever arrived.  This was a gift for my great-grandson who is crazy about garbage trucks.  His mother said it's an o.k. video but may be better for a child 4-6 years old. There's narrative about recycling, etc., way beyond a child under three.  But he's interested in seeing the trucks in action.",1237680000,,467,4.344827586206897
1663416,5,B00005U2KB,Parents....this series is a winner.  I have There Goes a Bulldozer at home at my son is getting the entire series for his 3rd birthday.  If your kid loves cars/trucks/power vehicles they will be hooked.  For us?  If you take it for what it is....the show is awesome.  it's so bad it's great! (in the best possible meaning) They do these little skits and slapstick with Dave and he carries the show very well.,1237075200,,408,4.45945945945946
1663417,4,B00005U2KB,"My son (3 year old) loves this movie. The first time we found it at the library about a year ago and we rented it about 4 times. Finally, I bought it for him. I don't enjoy hearing the actors voices (annoying) but the movie shows a lot of trucks.. and some (I guess) funny parts that my son  loves.",1232150400,,298,3.966666666666667

1663419,2,B00005U2KB,"There is way too much mindless chitchat between the two hosts. My 20 month old makes me fast-forward all the talking bits until an actual truck is shown. Don't talk down to kids...they hate it even at a young age. And it drives adults crazy! Also, there are several instances when the hosts are rude and snarky to each other or doing something stupidly dangerous in order to get a laugh....for instance: host Dave gets blasted with a fire hose and he falls down, host Becky gets dumped into the back of the dump truck, Dave gets dumped, too, and then the two jump out of a big garbage truck and when it starts to roll away without a driver, they chase after it.

Okay, so my kid doesn't really get all that yet, but still. What's the point of doing all that? There are some really good bits about where the recycling goes....these nice informative parts could be better explored with Dave (who has a nice announcer's voice) doing a voice over. Stay behind the camera Dave, and better editing would be good, too. Also, don't let the untrained professionals (like the firefighters and garbage dudes) ramble on and on about their profession without a script; and if they stutter or stumble, then for chrissakes, reshoot it. Really lame waste of $10. Will not be showing it to my kid again if only to save my own sanity, and to prevent him from acting like a buffoon like the hosts.",1222300800,4,1378,4.49003984063745
1663420,5,B00005U2KB,"We first found this video (now DVD) when my now 12-year-old son was a toddler.  My son fell completely in love with the series, and we are happily passing the tradition along to children of friends.  Dave and Becky are very funny, and appeal to kids of all ages (including grownups).  It's a series of DVDs that is not annoying for adults, and keeps kids mesmerized.  Enjoy!",1220659200,,374,4.537313432835821

quick. This video is too mature for him.  My mistake!",1219017600,,123,4.3478260869565215
1663422,5,B00005U2KB,"While Dave is pretty annoying to most adults, kids love these videos. Just like most adults don't like shows such as Barney, they aren't made for adults. My boys would watch all the Real Wheels videos over & over all day long if they could. I highly recommend them, especially for the price.",1214438400,,291,4.509433962264151
1663433,5,B00005U2KB,"I have to agree with the one reviewer that said that Dave is one of the most annoying hosts ever.  He is.  But my 2 year son absolutely LOVES this video.  He is obsessed with garbage trucks and would watch this video 100 times a day if I would let him.  I thought he would get bored by all of the talking and ""plots"" but he loves every minute of it.",1209600000,,349,3.8732394366197185
1663434,5,B00005U2KB,This seried is spectacular.  My son loves Dave's slapstick style.  He laughs out loud. I tend to chime in as well. I would recommend these informative and entertaining videos to anyone.,1200355200,,185,4.935483870967742
1663435,2,B00005U2KB,"My son loved the ""firetruck"" video so much I bought 5 more in the series.

We've only watched 'garbage truck' and 'trucks' so far but we HATE them. Dave seems to have lost his mind - or maybe he's drunk? He babbles, rambles stream of concious, berates Becky...and there is WAY too much of Dave and Becky and not enough of the trucks.

The only one we watch is 'firetruck' the rest is garbage.",1192924800,,392,4.283783783783784
1663436,3,B00005U2KB,I think this video would be great if it had less talking and a little more fire engines.  We do like the video.  It just needs to be updated.,1192665600,,141,3.8275862068965516
1663437,3,B00005U2KB,"Movie is something out of, like, the mid 90's. I found it to be annoying as hell, but my 3 year old loves it-too much. It hasn't left the DVD player in a month, and it's on as I type this review. I no longer watch the news without hearing, ""I wanna watch firetruck!!""",1191715200,,267,3.962962962962963
1663438,5,B00005U2KB,"Great video for teaching kids about community vehicles (firetrucks, garbage trucks, etc.) My son knows more about them than I do and spews facts to me whenever we see a truck on the road. Would recommend to anyone with little kids interested in trucks.",1186531200,2,252,4.75
1663439,2,B00005U2KB,"I do not show this to my grandson any more.  it is more about a man who appears to be stupid, who does crazy  things to try to b e funny. This is not the image of a construction worker that I want him to see.  The trucks are good, though, if you can get past, ""I shouldn't have done that!""",1182816000,4,289,3.7049180327868854

1663441,5,B00005U2KB,"We started collecting this series when my son was 2 and now have all the DVDs. Some parts are dorky, and he is generally a discerning viewer, but he has grown up with ""Dave"" and it has gotten us through lots of sniffly nights, long car rides and plane flights, etc. etc. And he has learned A LOT in spite of the dorkiness.

1663454,5,B00005U2KB,"My (now 3 year old) son LOVES these DVD's.  He has watched them all multiple times.  Whenever we're in the car, every time he sees a piece of construction equipment, a fire truck or a garbage truck (or any of the vehicles featured on the DVD's) he gets very excited and yells, ""THERE'S DAVE!!!""  This is of course, followed closely by the name of whatever truck or vehicle he is seeing at that particular time.

The DVD's are great for kids as they are informative about what the various trucks/vehicles do. and/or where they go.  Dave Hood is fun for kids to watch because he's always getting himself into trouble for not listening to instructions.  Then, when it's his turn to do something, he generally messes it up and then has to fix it (with the tag line ""I shouldn't have done THAT.""  There is a nice take home message on the DVDs. Kids are encouraged to read and to stay in school, and then if they want to learn more about ""whichever topic is on the DVD...."" they can go to their local library and find out more.",1171411200,3,1021,4.37037037037037
1663455,5,B00005U2KB,This DVD is great.  I bought it for my daughter (3)and my 2 nephews (5 & 4) and they all love it. All kids love trucks - boys or girls!,1168819200,,135,3.5
1663456,5,B00005U2KB,"My boys love Pilot Dave, Busdriver Dave, Engineer Dave, etc.  Adding this one to our collection made their Christmas.  Dave Hood as a fireman, garbage collector and truck driver is at his cheesiest best in these pics and for kids who love trucks, this DVD is a great gift.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1168300800,,302,4.555555555555555
1663457,5,B00005U2KB,The Real Wheels series is fabulous for little boys! They're simple and entertaining. Dave is a star in my boys' world. He goes on these great adventures with all kinds of vehicles and educates his viewers on how things work in terms little kids can understand. we have six of these DVD's now and the kids never tire of them! We have given them as gifts and receive great reviews from other little boys as well. they are starting to appear a little dated but it all translates for little boys. Thanks Dave!!!,1167264000,2,507,4.462365591397849
1663458,5,B00005U2KB,My little boy loves Dave (and Becky too).  He loves any type of vehicle and this series offers a lot of variety for him.  This particular one is one of his favorites.  It has really expanded his vocabulary and his understanding of how the vehicles work and their jobs.,1166745600,,268,4.428571428571429
1663459,5,B00005U2KB,"I believe we now have all of the ""There Goes A..."" DVDs. Honestly, I don't think there is even one that my two and four-year olds would not sit and watch in their entirety. This DVD is actually MY personal favorite. Of all the Dave DVD's, I think this one is the funniest. Included in this DVD are There Goes a Firetruck, There Goes a Garbage Truck and There Goes a Truck. Whenever we're out and see a firetruck driving by, my boys want to come home and watch the firetruck show. On our garbage pick-up days they usually ask to watch the garbage truck show after the truck picks up our trash. There Goes a Truck covers numerous trucks from monster trucks to big rigs to tow trucks. There are so many funny moments between Dave and his side-kick Becky. Our favorite is on the garbage truck show when Becky drives off with Dave stuck in a truck yelling, ""Wait Becky, Wait!!!""

I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Dave Hood DVDs. This one is just the best of the best in our opinion! =)",1163980800,2,994,4.231578947368421
1663460,1,B00005U2KB,"My son loves ""real life"" trucks and big machines, so I thought these would be fun for him to watch. They are not, in fact they don't even hold his attention. Dave talks way too much and is way too goofy even for little kids. Just show the trucks in action and forget all the up close stuff on Dave. I have since bought the I Love CAT Machines series and they are fantastic.",1161907200,10,373,4.054054054054054
1663461,4,B00005U2KB,"Our 2 y/o isn't big on movies/tv but when I have something that needs to get done, I can count on this dvd to entertain him. He loves Dave and Becky (however dorky they are!) and all their antics and the special features are a big hit with him, too. He likes the firetruck song/sing-a-long video feature. I highly recommend this video. His favorite is the garbage truck program. He hasn't watched the other ones in their entirety.",1154390400,3,430,4.5256410256410255
1663462,5,B00005U2KB,"My children have watched these videos for years.  My oldest is 11 and he still loves them.  I have learned so much myself from the Dave Hood series.  Dave seems to have a real love for children and his personality is wonderful.  The reviewer that commented that their 2 year old wasn't interested probably hasn't clued into the fact that 2 year olds have no business watching television.  As a preschool teacher and home educator, I've learned that most children under 4 can't understand the difference between television and reality.  They are very literal and don't understand jokes.  My son was so obsessed with trucks when he was 3 that he started crying when he saw a ""broken"" truck as we passed the scene of a car accident.  The Dave Hood videos are very educational and entertaining.  Our family has tried many different ""truck"" videos, and these are the best on the market.  I wouldn't recommend, however, the newer editions that don't include Dave Hood.",1146268800,6,962,4.775757575757575
1663463,3,B00005U2KB,"All in all an ok Dvd.  Did not hold the interest of my 2 year old who is facinated with trucks, fire trucks.  It was a little slow moving at times due mainly to the narration and interviews.",1142899200,,190,3.973684210526316
1663464,5,B00005U2KB,"I have a few of the old ""Real Wheels"" series on VHS and I want to sell the videos and get the series on DVD. I don't have the entire series on DVD.",1141344000,,147,3.484848484848485
1663465,5,B00005U2KB,We have most of The Real Wheel Adventures my 2 year old son would watch them over and over again if allowed. His twin sister not quite as thrilled with them,1140739200,2,156,4.064516129032258
1663466,5,B00005U2KB,"We started with ""There Goes a Dump Truck"" which actually features a different ""Dave.""  This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both.

Anyway, I started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the TV.  I don't let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall TV to things that are at least somewhat informative/educational.  As a result, he was never one to sit and watch much TV (made it hard for me to get things done!).  But, with this series, he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles (and some of the more goofy moments) so much.  It really was a lifesaver at times.  Needless to say it didn't take long for me to collect the entire series.  I have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations.  My in-laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the ""Tractor"" and ""Farm Truck"" versions with him.

His favorites include ""There goes a Firetruck,"" ""There goes a Monster Truck"" and ""There goes a Spaceship.""  But, he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus!

I can't say enough good things about the video series as far as my son's enjoyment goes.  Just don't look for any oscars for the acting and editing.  It's pretty choppy, even for an amateur eye.

I would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle.",1137369600,3,1709,4.446945337620579
1663467,3,B00005U2KB,"Dave has to be one of the most annoying hosts ever. Sadly, he's in all the videos and equally annoying in all of them. My son, age 2 and 1/2, really enjoys this series but it seems to be in spite of Dave, not because of him! He loves the machines but can lose interest in the other 'plots' and Dave's 'interviews'. I think, as he gets older, my son will appreciate these more. However, I'll save them for visits with grandparents or a sitter, just for my own sanity. I Dig Dirt and Twent Trucks are better.",1133481600,2,506,4.173469387755102

To sustain its shelf life in your CURRENT DVD collection I would recommend you vary its programming options for your child.  You may select an ALL PLAY which runs straight through all the vehicles listed.  Or you may do an individual play for a vehicle of your choice.  What is even better is the footage between the full-length film and the indvidual vehicles is slightly different.  Its almost like having 4 videos in one.  Give it a try!

I am now purchasing the dvd's for a nephew and for a friends 2 year old.  Hope they have as much fun wathching as my boys did.",1064966400,2,426,3.659340659340659
1663477,5,B00005U2KB,Mom's beware that once your 2 or 3 year old boys watch this DVD you will never watch another DVD again.  My son has watched all these DVD's in the series over and over again.  These are a great buy.  I did not hesitate to pre-order all the other DVD's in the series.  Buy yours today.,1062806400,2,284,4.017857142857143
1663478,5,B00005U2KB,"My 2 year old son loves this DVD!  And my husband and I enjoy it as well.  This DVD includes 3 videos:  There Goes A Fire Truck, There Goes a Garbage Truck, and There goes a Truck, plus a bunch of special features.  This is a great deal!  Most children's DVD's are just copies of their VHS cousins, with no bonus material, lasting only 30 minutes, and expensive  This one is over 90 minutes, and priced the same as other DVD's.
We don't own a TV, so we curl up in front of the computer and watch.  We love truck driver Dave, and his side-kick truck driver Becky for their enthusiasm, sense of humor, and their ability to teach in a very entertaining way.  I do hope they come out with more DVD versions of ""There Goes..."" series.  We would buy them all.  Our son has learned so much, and animately describes the scenes to me as each new scenario comes up.  I think girls would enjoy this, too.  Becky is right in there with Dave and all their misadventures.
Highly recommended.  You and your kids will be very happy you purchased this great DVD",1041724800,16,1044,4.292307692307692
1663479,5,B00005U2KB,"I was very pleased to see this dvd version of Dave Hood's entertaining series.  It contains three of the popular shows -- There Goes a Fire Truck, There Goes a Garbage Truck, and There Goes a Truck.  We have about ten of these Dave Hood videos on VHS, and think There Goes a Fire Truck is the very best.  There Goes a Garbage Truck  shows us a variety of refuse removal vehicles as well as recycling facilities, and There Goes a Truck displays a wide variety of trucks, including a monster truck, tow truck, military transforming trucks and the world's biggest truck -- used to transport the Space Shuttle.  The latter two selections feature Becky as well as Dave, and all have the goofy humor that keeps kids laughing.
DVD extras are winners at our house too, and include a sing-a-long song about the sounds a fire truck makes, an interactive fire truck (which will teach your child to use the remote faster than any verbal  instruction!), an interactive video glossary that uses a number of short film clips to demonstrate hoses, helmets, etc.  There's even a bloopers reel.
Honestly, if your kids like the series, they will LOVE this dvd, and the price is very good.  Another winner from Dave Hood.",1035417600,33,1201,4.632075471698113
1663480,5,B00005U2KB,"I'm sure most people looking at this DVD are already familiar with the There Goes... series. They all feature Dave and sometimes Becky looking into some kind of vehicle or piece of equipment. Designed for children, they are very watchable by adults and are fairly educational, if for nothing else than the vocabulary.
 What I like best about the DVD is that it contains 3 programs. It could fit 4 but hey it's better than wasting a whole DVD on less than 30 minutes like many other children's titles. With the individual videos selling for as much as [$], getting three on a DVD for [$$](...) is a good deal. Now that I've eliminated VHS in my house, it is nice to see multi-program DVDs like this one and I hope to see more in the future...
 I have just a few comments about this DVD in regards to the content. I really didn't find any of the scenes too ""scary"" or irresponsible as few others have described. There is some comedy about Dave falling in the garbage, but there are also several examples of safety commentary in the program as there are in all the Real Wheels tapes.",1028592000,15,1080,4.422110552763819
7954151,4,B00005U2KB,"'Real Wheels - there goes a...' are educational and fun.  They have a great way of educating kids and adults by presenting the information in a silly but clear manner.  My son was given several of these and the adults had just as much fun watching them as he did.
Now we are getting them for my great-nephew.",1517184000,,308,4.293103448275862

The Real Wheels adventure DVDs are a great hit with my toddler.  I can't stand some of the kid DVDs out so this was a great find.  It is not obnoxious for a parent to watch ro listen to, and it is captivating for a little boy.  Love the series!",1505692800,3,274,3.9272727272727272
7954153,5,B00005U2KB,"I first saw ""There goes a Firetruck"" when I was 5 or 6 years old. I enjoyed Dave's antics and of course loved the fire trucks. Fast forward 20 years, and I now live ""There goes a Firetruck"" every day as a firefighter in my hometown. This video is the first moment I remember knowing I wanted to be a fireman, and I still sit down and watch it from time to time so I never forget where I came from, and I just might still enjoy it!

Forget all the crap cartoons out there, buy your kids the real wheels series, and sit down and watch it with them, you'll be glad you did someday.",1486684800,,578,3.9827586206896552

It has 3 episodes on it, each one focusing on a separate truck area: garbage trucks, fire trucks, and other trucks. It is all live action and shows the real deal.. how they work, who works them, safety tips, etc. But it is done in a way that is entertaining for the kids.
The company I purchased it from was fast and professional.
Would recommend it!",1475452800,,560,4.054054054054054
