8567865,5,B00BG0D94W,"This is a great little film (roughly 40 minutes) about a family that is in the business of making maple syrup. I had no clue what went into making maple syrup, so I found this film very informative. I thought it was great seeing how the whole family is involved in the process. I don't remember the toddler's name (the one on the cover), but he provides some great comedy relief.",1366675200,,379,4.352112676056338
