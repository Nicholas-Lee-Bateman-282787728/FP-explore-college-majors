I rarely watch TV at all, and practically NEVER follow a show, but I can't wait for Friday's when the new episode is on. I haven't enjoyed any show as much as this since Weeds.",1241049600,,302,4.135593220338983

3049730,5,B0010S5Z5G,This is such a great show and I can't wait for to come back when should I expect it? I hope it's not going to  be another one of the shows that you really like and you never see it again the networks just put it into never never land.,1379289600,,234,3.68
3049731,5,B0010S5Z5G,Very interesting show.  I love the characters.  They all bring a different side of life to the show.  I am sure u can see yourself in at least one of these ladies.,1379030400,,163,4.03125
3049732,5,B0010S5Z5G,I so enjoyed watching this series of Mistresses.  The characters are great and I like the story line for each of them. Jess is my favorite.,1378771200,,139,4.346153846153846

3049738,5,B0010S5Z5G,I love that they bring to life the trials and tribulations of being in love and being in relationships. Love is love and love is complicated and I just love how they are able to bring all of that to life!,1376697600,,204,4.0
3049739,4,B0010S5Z5G,"Came across this a few years back OnDemand and fell in love with it. Although British and a tad dated with styles, it's much better than the American remake currently airing on TV. A bit raunchy at time and boy do I love Dominique! I'd watch all available seasons anytime and wish the BBC continued this run.",1376179200,,308,4.421052631578948

3049741,2,B0010S5Z5G,Being a older gentleman this show does not have any material that would hold my interest. At least the American version had some very attractive actors.,1375574400,,152,4.884615384615385
3049742,4,B0010S5Z5G,Well written story and characters. Something like a very different romantic comedy. Attractive women with varied lives and sexual encounters.,1375488000,,141,6.1
3049743,4,B0010S5Z5G,"The first season was engaging, as were the various dilemmas of the four main characters: the doctor who follows her heart and makes some poor moral and ethical choices which could destroy her career; the long married lawyer who falls into a torrid affair; the freewheeling sexpot who finally falls in love [ with a woman], and the very charming housewife, back on the dating scene six years after losing her husband. Some nice twists and fairly believable story lines.
The same, sadly, cannot be said for the second season which was an appalling cross between General Hospital and Sex and the City, though the third season wraps things up nicely if you go the distance. All four actresses have wonderful moments, though I confess having a weak spot for Trudi, the housewife, played by Sharon Small.",1375056000,,798,4.8321167883211675

3049746,4,B0010S5Z5G,"Let's face it.  This is not high drama, but it is fun to watch! The characters are funny, look good and have that tongue in cheek British humor.  Liked this series much better than the American version.",1374624000,,202,4.4324324324324325

3049748,5,B0010S5Z5G,I loved each character with they're own distinct personalities.  The friendship between them was intense and the honesty was brutal. There is a lot to learn from these ladies.,1373760000,,175,5.0344827586206895
3049749,4,B0010S5Z5G,"For me, this series started out way too slow. It was enjoyable for the most part, but thirty minutes in, I had the entire series figured out. I could have written this. I watched two DVD's of six episodes and everything I guessed would happen did. Everything I surmised unfolded before my eyes, which made it way too predictable for me. After trudging through the DVD's over two different days, though it was predictable, I found that I enjoyed it anyway.
Overall, if you're a fan of Sex and the City and/or Desperate Housewives, you should enjoy this one. The characters are vivid, sympathetic and believable.",1373587200,,610,4.764150943396227
3049750,5,B0010S5Z5G,"So far, I am really liking this British series ""Mistresses"".  I saw the first episode of the American version and hated it.  As I was perusing Amazon Prime I came across this show, saw that there were multiple seasons and decided to give it a go.  I love it!!!!!!!!!",1372204800,,266,4.387755102040816

3049753,5,B0010S5Z5G,For those who are watching the new ABC remake of this show: go to the source and watch the BBC version. It's a great drama about four women with complicated lives,1371686400,,162,4.258064516129032
3049754,4,B0010S5Z5G,"As an American who believes that the U.S. is the best producer of good television and movies, it is embarrassing to admit that the British did a much better job with this series.  With the exception of the cold character portrayal by the actress that plays Siobhan, the casting is far superior in this British version.  I was so excited about the U.S. version that was advertised and couldn't wait to see it that I watched the entire British version on Amazon to whet my appetite.  If I had realized that I was spoiling my experience by watching this more enticing version first, I might have done things differently.  At least I can eliminate a program from my DVR now.",1371513600,,670,4.558333333333334

3049758,4,B0010S5Z5G,"I've been watching a lot of BBC shows lately and stumbled across this one. I rather enjoyed the whole series. I enjoyed the characters and seeing how they got themselves out of (or back into) their ""mistress"" situations. Never a dull moment!",1370476800,,241,4.761904761904762
3049759,4,B0010S5Z5G,"Season 1 introduces the 4 friends who may or may not be mistresses.  It gets right into the intrigue and reasons women become mistresses.  Love that the BBC program presents more ""realistic"" women the the US' ABC version. Sexy and passionate without having to necessarily see private body parts.  What is a ""mistress"" anyway?  The definitions in Merriam Webster seem to be opposites of one another - head of household or woman other than wife?  So which of the definitions is each woman trying to fulfill?",1370390400,,505,4.825581395348837
3049760,3,B0010S5Z5G,"I found this series a bit predictable and somewhat dull. I gave it ""the old college try"" by watching almost the whole first season. It is really depressing and left me with a dark, unhappy feeling. I would recommend if your in the mood for drama, drama, drama.",1370390400,,260,4.4375
3049761,5,B0010S5Z5G,A compelling story of 4 gals in the UK coping with their life struggles around men and relationships. Good Story!,1369785600,,113,4.7
3049762,5,B0010S5Z5G,"I'm on to season 2 and loving this series, I watch an episode every chance I get. I stumbled upon it while browsing Amazon's selections and started watching before becoming aware that a US verison will be starting soon.",1369699200,,219,4.641025641025641

3049764,5,B0010S5Z5G,Great show; strong testament about tempation and not being in control of your emotions. Actors had great chemistry and it was good to see when they could overcome obstacles.,1368489600,,173,5.0
3049765,4,B0010S5Z5G,I love this series. The characters are smart and funny. The first series plot is intriguing and they make use of the six episodes.,1367712000,,130,4.458333333333333

3049767,1,B0010S5Z5G,Raunchy and uncouth. Poor acting and story line. Waste of time. Was able to form this opinion after only 3 mins of viewing.,1367107200,,123,4.391304347826087
3049768,5,B0010S5Z5G,"Romantic, erotic, dramatic and sometimes funny. I don't normally watch these type of shows but this one drew me in and held my interest.  Excellent acting.  Wished it would have ran a few more years.",1367020800,,199,4.6571428571428575
3049769,5,B0010S5Z5G,"I enjoyed watching Season One but had a tough time understanding the destructive nature of Katie and Shoiban (sp) characters.  I have a tough time relating to mature, educated women who seemed to make very poor judgement calls relating to lust and love!",1366243200,,253,4.883720930232558
3049770,5,B0010S5Z5G,It's a show I never expected to like but fell in love with it and all the characters. I wish it had lasted longer than 3 seasons.,1365638400,,129,3.814814814814815
3049771,5,B0010S5Z5G,"Loved the series; it transported me to a world that I can only occupy in my dreams and TV! The women are diverse,their problems and issues are current. While the situations are contrived and we all know the outcome, it is a terrific ride that I didn't want to end. I was disappointed that the show didn't continue past the first 3 seasons",1365638400,,338,4.380952380952381
3049772,5,B0010S5Z5G,"Sorry I missed this at its original release.  It wasn't what I expected.  Not only was it well done it was addicting..  Couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Well acted, written and produced.  Don't miss it!",1365033600,,211,4.594594594594595

3049774,3,B0010S5Z5G,The actresses are good but the plot lines are of the day-time soap variety. If you  like that sort of thing you will enjoy this show.  I could not relate to the character's frankly stupid choice sin life and it seemed to be a vehicle for promoting and approving of cheating on spouses.,1364515200,,285,4.3584905660377355

3049779,5,B0010S5Z5G,"From the title of the series, I was expecting some sad little gold digging trollops whining over men with more money than sense. Then I remembered that this was a BBC, and not written by Americans. Since other people have already given pretty accurate descriptions, I'll simply just say it's worth watching. I'm already into Season Two and dying to know what happens to the characters.",1362614400,,385,4.848484848484849

3049781,3,B0010S5Z5G,"I liked the first two season immensely, then the 3rd season made no sense what so ever. If season 3 had been as good as the first 2 then I would have given it 5 stars..",1356393600,,168,3.6944444444444446
3049782,5,B0010S5Z5G,"This was an interesting series to watch; enjoyable at times for it's ""girls' night out"" aspects and a good drama depicting the trials and tribulations of each woman.  Their close friendships with each other are so solid, that these four women are there for each other through thick and thin.  Comedy and drama, featuring four women, each embodying different personalities and lifestyles, yet somehow being able to comfort each other and celebrate their lives with each other.",1331942400,,475,5.1558441558441555
3049783,5,B0010S5Z5G,"I just happened to stumble upon this show while channel-surfing on a lazy Sunday but ever since then I am HOOKED!  I absolutely love it!  I loved S&TC for years and was faithful to it.  I was completely bummed when it went off but now that I found Mistresses, I have a new favorite ""girl-show""! :)",1329782400,2,297,4.267857142857143
3049784,5,B0010S5Z5G,"I think that the British people who produced and distributed the series ""Mistresses, Vol. 1"" are way to sophisticated for the people in the States who has bowed down to the spit drooling mob, that follows ""Sex in The City"". The ""Mistresses,Vol. 1"" has an engaging plot. The subject of sex and relationships was handled with intelligence. I did not experience dead spots in the series,the pace is very developed. I wish there is a Mistresses, Vol. 2 on region 1 DVD. Your girl will love it. She can see your UNDERSTAND-ABLE side!",1311120000,2,528,4.688172043010753
3049785,5,B0010S5Z5G,"Mistresses is one of those shows that you can't help but love. It's a little bit soap, a little bit romance, and a little bit comedy. It follows four friends: Katie (Sarah Parish), Trudi (Sharon Small), Jessica (Shelley Conn), and Siobhan (Orla Brady) as they each in their own way, become a mistress -- albeit not always intentionally. Through it all, they remain the best of friends and are there for each other no matter what. What I love most about this DVD is that it includes both the first and second series of show, so you won't have to go out and buy them separately. All in all, I was very pleased with the Misresses Volume 1 DVD.",1307923200,2,640,4.38655462184874
3049786,5,B0010S5Z5G,"I immensely like this sophisticated, British version of Sex & the City and Desperate Housewives. It's not as quickly paced as American TV shows. The pace is slower, the characters are deeper and darker and more credible, but just as likeable. I wished there were more shows like this.

I also liked the lesbian storyline with the beautiful and sexy Anna Torv as a co star.

An outview: Seasons 2 and 3 are unfortunately not as good, but still worth to watch.

Highly recommended.",1302912000,6,479,4.678571428571429
3049787,3,B0010S5Z5G,"I quite liked the first three episodes of this UK TV series. Lots of small accurate observations of everyday life, hung on a flimsy but adequate plot structure. For people who enjoy this kind of episodic love-centered drama it's definitely got a few things to recommend it including pretty good acting and some nice lines - clever but not so clever as to make one think ""no one says things like that in real life."" The various relationships unfold in a predictable but also very realistic manner.

Until we come to Episode 5, at which point it all starts to feel very over-done indeed. Maybe it's the influence of countless generations of imported US TV shows, maybe it's just our global zeitgeist, but whatever it is, it's had a malevolent effect on UK script writing. The series moves from being a slice-of-life to being a slice-of-Dallas/Desperate Housewives/Sex-in-the-City and whatever else you can scrape up off the bottom of someone's old weekly TV Guide.

Worse yet, the true-to-life observations fly out of the window. One of the most characteristic qualities of a break-up is the way in which  people (and especially women) re-write history in order to justify their actions. Memories shift, distort, and alter overnight. But here, the protagonists all continue to share a common frame of reference. And this is what ultimately makes the series fall down - what was up until this point an adequate representation of real life becomes just a plot-driven shell where various ""dramatic"" denouements are forced into their various pre-canned places.  And despite continued attempts by the cast to carry the story line, it really disappoints in a big way.  If only there had not been the need for the Hollywood Drama Plot Lines one through seven, this would have been quite an interesting series. As it is, by the end I was feeling depressed by the conformity and predictability of the whole thing - all that was missing was the hackneyed ""so you're really my sister's younger brother"" routine so beloved of US soaps and stale movies.",1300665600,,2038,4.912790697674419
3049788,5,B0010S5Z5G,I love this show I love the story I love the characters in this show mostly Jessica she is a hellcat look out for her. I love this show all that I can say,1291075200,,154,3.5588235294117645
3049789,4,B0010S5Z5G,"So ""Mistresses Vol. 1"" has 12 episodes.  The first six episodes are from the first season.  The second six episodes are from the second season.

Season 1 (i.e. the first six episodes) are really great.  There is so much packed into each episode.  It makes you realize how much filler they put into American dramas.  While some storylines were more interesting to me than others, the whole thing held my attention.

With a title like ""Mistresses"" one can easily assume that all the women are mistresses.  That's not exactly true.  Katie was the mistress of a man who has just died, but for her it wasn't casual.  She loved the man and believed that he loved her.  Jessica likes casual sex and relishes being a mistress because that means there are no attachments, until she becomes the mistress of someone that she wants to keep all for herself.  Siobhan isn't a mistress but rather a cheater.  She loves her husband, but when their sex life is lacking, she looks elsewhere to get her sexual needs met.  And Trudi also is not a mistress.  It is her husband (presumed dead) that she finds out had been deceiving her, both by cheating on her and other lies as well.  Season 1 was all high fun and high drama.  I recommend these first six episodes without restraint.

But season 2... well, season 2 does not live up to season 1's standards.  Basically, all the characters relive their storylines from season 1 but with different love interests.  Katie finds herself the mistress of a man she really cares about, just like the set up for season 1.  Jessica marries a man with the understanding of an open marriage, but then she finds she doesn't want to share him... just like the realization she came to in season 1.  Siobhan still loves her husband but is still dissatisfied with their sex life, so she decides to go outside her marriage to get her needs met... just like she did in season 1.  The new man in Trudi's life is not cheating on her, but he has been lying to her about numerous important things... just like her husband had done in season 1.

Granted, it can't be easy to keep a premise like this going.  With ""Mistresses"" as the title, there's got to be a lot of infidelity.  It's too bad that they could find different ways to express it though.  I found season 2 to be a big let down after how fabulous season 1 was.  Another big difference between season 1 and season 2 was the amount of time the women spend together.  In season 1, they share a lot of scenes and you get a good sense of how important their friendship is to them.  In season 2, they spend very little time together, and when they are together, they're rarely fully honest with each other.

All things considered, season 1 was really great.  I'm glad I watched it, and if you like dramas, don't hesitate to give ""Mistresses"" a try.",1290643200,6,2810,4.459724950884087
3049790,4,B0010S5Z5G,"The previous reviewer noted a good many plot flaws (especially the physician who immediately gets into another ill-advised affair after having just completed a year's suspension from practicing medicine for having an affair with a patient).

The fact that all these women live in beautiful houses despite (for the event planner and the housewife, at any rate) having low incomes was pretty far-fetched, but I think the most fun part was that the men were all honestly in love with the women with whom they were having sex and STILL managed to wreck their lives!

Nonetheless, it was highly entertaining, and I would recommend this series to anyone with a day or so off from work! I just wish the next season (season 3?) was also available in the U.S.",1285545600,,750,4.7615384615384615
3049791,3,B0010S5Z5G,"I've separately reviewed season one.  There is no separate listing for season two.  I've now seen both seasons and my view hasn't changed.  This is evening prime time soap opera. In season two it was even more like SEX AND THE CITY and not much at all like DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES. The latter show, in fact, is considerably DEEPER than either this show or SEX AND THE CITY.  However, I found this show watchable while working on some art projects.

There are some points in the script which could have used some professional consultation.  For example, at one point the husband of the woman lawyer brings a custody suit against her for her infant child when he is NOT the biological father of the child and he knows this.  He is sterile. Said biological father is the mother's law partner.  The husband was no part of any agreement for her getting pregnant this way.  It was as a result of an affair. Nevertheless, the husband sues both of them for custody and he does not even have a job!  It is beyond incredible that he could find ANY law firm to bring a case this preposterous, especially given that he has no money. If he were wealthy, I suppose he might find some firm dishonest enough to tell him he had a case just for the fees.  But he is not.

Second, the woman doctor first admitted to having sex with her patient (even though there was no proof) and was suspended from practice for a year. From this she goes straight into having an affair upon reinstatement with BOTH the married doctor who hired her AND his best friend, also a surgeon. Once again she takes ALL of the blame publicly upon herself when this all comes to light, making herself a pariah in the hospital.  Here's my question.  Has anyone ever met ANY doctor this self effacing, selfless, abasing and eternally atoning? I don't think so.

Third, Sharon Small is still married to the guy who was arrested for playing dead, pretending to be a victim of the 9/11 bombings.  Even though Small has returned the two million from the widows' fund, her life should be a non-stop legal sideshow because of him.  At the very least, he should be trying to get at his equity in the house to pay for his legal defense.  Yet NOTHING is happening as a consequence of this whatsoever! She is on to the next romance!

Finally, the promiscuous lesbian, marries a GUY and then has problems with his promiscuity even though they entered into an open marriage. Generally, the only people who make it through this kind of open marital setup are those to whom sex acts as a default solution to total ennui.  The wife here, by contrast, is a ball of fire on every level and incredibly passionate about everything. Such a person is not known for being able to share.  Certainly the way you see her kind of personality as a legal client is as the vengeful, maybe even murderous, wife, NOT as the female half of an open marriage. So, yes it is believable that she can't do it once in the marriage but it is unbelievable that she ever thought she could.

3049792,4,B0010S5Z5G,"This is really 3.5 stars for me but Amazon does not give us half stars to use in our reviews.

How much you like this show is going to depend on how much you like soap operas, whether day or evening fare.  It is upscale soap opera, however, which always sweetens the deal. The chief reason I tuned in was because Sharon Small is in it.  She played Havers on the Detective Lynley Mysteries and developed a lot of fans on this side of the pond as well as her own side.

There is another recognizable star too.  The actress who plays Olivia in the American prime time weekly series FRINGE is also in this UK series.  I did not realize she was British until I saw this show.

There is one problem with this series.  There are too many characters for only a six episode series.  Thus short shrift is given to each story instead of the longer and better study which could have been given the better ones. The best stories are of Small as the 9/11 widow with a two million pound settlement and the woman doctor who had an affair with her dying patient and then helped him die by morphine (euthanasia).  She gets involved with his son.

Less convincing are: 1) the female lawyer who has a sterile husband and gets pregnant by another lawyer in her firm and 2) the promiscuous lesbian who is all over the map on commitment issues. Both of these stories had so many variables piled onto them that they became totally unbelievable.

If you wish to see Small in a romance vehicle in which she does not have to share screen time with 3 other women's stories, I recommend you try GLASGOW KISS instead.

I did not like SEX AND THE CITY.  However, I have liked DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, although it has now seen its better days.  I would say that if you are a huge fan of SEX AND THE CITY, that you will probably also love this show.  If you are a huge fan of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, you may not, as this series is a lot gooier and sweeter than DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.

3049793,5,B0010S5Z5G,This is a highly entertaining British soap opera of sorts. Reminds me of the Amercian Sex and the City series. Story lines are fresh and decidely British in nature. If you enjoyed Desperate Housewives or Sex in the City I think you too will enjoy these grown up soap operas. I would not allow anyone under 14 years of age to watch as there is some slight nudity and very adult topics. I rate this a 5 star production. I look forward to the new seasons.,1257897600,,452,4.267441860465116

3049795,5,B0010S5Z5G,"When people ask me what Mistresses is about, I tell them, like someone else wrote, that it's a cross between Desperate Housewives & Sex & the City.  But you actually get so much more.  There is a lot that can get you hooked:  mysteries unfolding (is Trudi really getting calls from her dead husband?), romance brewing (the lesbian relationship between Jessica & Alex), forbidden relationships (Katie with a married man!  Katie with his son?!) & train wreck in slow motion (Siobhan's infidelity).

The 4 actresses who play the ladies are very competent & have great chemistry.  My only gripe is that, how come they all have so much free time to get together?  They are often seen having drinks & dinner at each others' house, meeting up in the middle of the day after one calls another.  That seems a bit unrealistic, but I guess they have to create opportunities for the 4 leads to share the screen.

This is an appealing & addictive series, with a talented & attractive cast - highly recommended!",1250812800,3,997,4.683908045977011
3049796,4,B0010S5Z5G,"This show starts off with a ludicrous and laughable premise. A primetime soap opera about 30's something's on different sides of infidelity. As predictable and ridiculously titillating as it was, I was hooked without realizing it. As a heterosexual black male from NYC, I have to say, the Brits know how to do a drama. This show is definitely worth watching, however I am a bit perturbed at the current 5/6/09 estimated price of 41 dollars for season 1 when its only about 11-15 dollars (through the conversion) for UK viewers (they have season 1 and 2 for about 35 through conversion). If this is what we do when we export our movies and shows to Canada and the UK, then I for one apologize. Seriously, this is an amazing series.

Quickly, without spoiling too much, in the first 15 minutes or so of the first episode we discover that Dependable Trudi is a 9/11 terrorist attack widow; 6 years after loosing her husband she gets a check for 2 million pounds and meets a new guy the same day. Coincidence? The vibrant Siobhan is an attorney who is trying to make partner in her law firm, however she and her husband are attempting to have their first child. Will this interfere with her career plans? Reserved and prim Doctor Kate has found a new love in her life and is happier than she has been in a long time. So why is she keeping him a secret from her friends? The wild and promiscuous (yeah I said it) Jessica is an event planner, who occasionally writes off the hotels for her sex romps as a ""Business Expense"". Never get serious or take yourself too seriously is her rule of engagement. So what are the rules when someone makes her want more than a casual encounter?

Season 1 is only 6 episodes ( And it ends with a bang!)",1241654400,20,1731,4.423197492163009
3049797,5,B0010S5Z5G,"The BBC show Mistresses reminded me of how differently women are viewed in Europe and North America. Mistresses is obviously inspired by Sex and the City. In the British show, four women who remain friends through all kinds of hardship and emotional turmoil even share the professions of some of the characters of Sex and the City. The way these shows portray women, however, couldn't be more different.

First, the characters of Mistresses look normal. They dress like regular women, their hair looks regular. Nobody on the BBC show is trying to create an illusion that women walk around the city and even go to work in skimpy shimmery dresses and outrageous heels, all the while keeping every hair on their heads in its place.

The most striking difference, of course, is not the characters' appearance. What really attracts me to the BBC show is that the women in Mistresses aren't pathetic. It's such a relief to see women who can have all the problems in the world but still never come close to being so ridiculously pathetic as the characters of shows such as Sex and the City.

In the American show, beautiful and successful women are ready to humiliate themselves to the extreme to recieve a crumb of affection from any passing loser. Besides being absolutely unrealistic, this image of contemporary womanhood is very offensive. Mistresses, on the other hand, doesn't follow such silly stereotypes. The female characters are surrounded by normal, attractive, realistically-looking men. They follow their hearts and their bodies without repeating the word ""relationship"" every 15 seconds. When they get together, they don't spend hours figuring out what HE said and did and what it means for the relationship. The characters of Mistresses concentrate on their own feelings and desires.

Watch BBC if you want to be reminded of what feminism is supposed to be about and just how dead it is in the US.

Some nice twists and fairly believable story lines.
The same, sadly, cannot be said for the second season which was an appalling cross between General Hospital and Sex and the City, though the third season wraps things up nicely if you go the distance.

Through it all, they remain the best of friends and are there for each other no matter what. What I love most about this DVD is that it includes both the first and second series of show, so you won't have to go out and buy them separately.

3284284,3,B0010S5Z5G,"I quite liked the first three episodes of this UK TV series. Lots of small accurate observations of everyday life, hung on a flimsy but adequate plot structure. For people who enjoy this kind of episodic love-centered drama it's definitely got a few things to recommend it including pretty good acting and some nice lines - clever but not so clever as to make one think ""no one says things like that in real life."" The various relationships unfold in a predictable but also very realistic manner.

Until we come to Episode 5, at which point it all starts to feel very over-done indeed. Maybe it's the influence of countless generations of imported US TV shows, maybe it's just our global zeitgeist, but whatever it is, it's had a malevolent effect on UK script writing. The series moves from being a slice-of-life to being a slice-of-Dallas/Desperate Housewives/Sex-in-the-City and whatever else you can scrape up off the bottom of someone's old weekly TV Guide.

Worse yet, the true-to-life observations fly out of the window. One of the most characteristic qualities of a break-up is the way in which  people (and especially women) re-write history in order to justify their actions. Memories shift, distort, and alter overnight. But here, the protagonists all continue to share a common frame of reference. And this is what ultimately makes the series fall down - what was up until this point an adequate representation of real life becomes just a plot-driven shell where various ""dramatic"" denouements are forced into their various pre-canned places.  And despite continued attempts by the cast to carry the story line, it really disappoints in a big way.  If only there had not been the need for the Hollywood Drama Plot Lines one through seven, this would have been quite an interesting series. As it is, by the end I was feeling depressed by the conformity and predictability of the whole thing - all that was missing was the hackneyed ""so you're really my sister's younger brother"" routine so beloved of US soaps and stale movies.",1300665600,,2038,4.912790697674419

3284286,4,B0010S5Z5G,"So ""Mistresses Vol. 1"" has 12 episodes.  The first six episodes are from the first season.  The second six episodes are from the second season.

Season 1 (i.e. the first six episodes) are really great.  There is so much packed into each episode.  It makes you realize how much filler they put into American dramas.  While some storylines were more interesting to me than others, the whole thing held my attention.

With a title like ""Mistresses"" one can easily assume that all the women are mistresses.  That's not exactly true.  Katie was the mistress of a man who has just died, but for her it wasn't casual.  She loved the man and believed that he loved her.  Jessica likes casual sex and relishes being a mistress because that means there are no attachments, until she becomes the mistress of someone that she wants to keep all for herself.  Siobhan isn't a mistress but rather a cheater.  She loves her husband, but when their sex life is lacking, she looks elsewhere to get her sexual needs met.  And Trudi also is not a mistress.  It is her husband (presumed dead) that she finds out had been deceiving her, both by cheating on her and other lies as well.  Season 1 was all high fun and high drama.  I recommend these first six episodes without restraint.

But season 2... well, season 2 does not live up to season 1's standards.  Basically, all the characters relive their storylines from season 1 but with different love interests.  Katie finds herself the mistress of a man she really cares about, just like the set up for season 1.  Jessica marries a man with the understanding of an open marriage, but then she finds she doesn't want to share him... just like the realization she came to in season 1.  Siobhan still loves her husband but is still dissatisfied with their sex life, so she decides to go outside her marriage to get her needs met... just like she did in season 1.  The new man in Trudi's life is not cheating on her, but he has been lying to her about numerous important things... just like her husband had done in season 1.

Granted, it can't be easy to keep a premise like this going.  With ""Mistresses"" as the title, there's got to be a lot of infidelity.  It's too bad that they could find different ways to express it though.  I found season 2 to be a big let down after how fabulous season 1 was.  Another big difference between season 1 and season 2 was the amount of time the women spend together.  In season 1, they share a lot of scenes and you get a good sense of how important their friendship is to them.  In season 2, they spend very little time together, and when they are together, they're rarely fully honest with each other.

All things considered, season 1 was really great.  I'm glad I watched it, and if you like dramas, don't hesitate to give ""Mistresses"" a try.",1290643200,6,2810,4.459724950884087
3284287,4,B0010S5Z5G,"The previous reviewer noted a good many plot flaws (especially the physician who immediately gets into another ill-advised affair after having just completed a year's suspension from practicing medicine for having an affair with a patient).

The fact that all these women live in beautiful houses despite (for the event planner and the housewife, at any rate) having low incomes was pretty far-fetched, but I think the most fun part was that the men were all honestly in love with the women with whom they were having sex and STILL managed to wreck their lives!

Nonetheless, it was highly entertaining, and I would recommend this series to anyone with a day or so off from work! I just wish the next season (season 3?) was also available in the U.S.",1285545600,,750,4.7615384615384615
3284288,3,B0010S5Z5G,"I've separately reviewed season one.  There is no separate listing for season two.  I've now seen both seasons and my view hasn't changed.  This is evening prime time soap opera. In season two it was even more like SEX AND THE CITY and not much at all like DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES. The latter show, in fact, is considerably DEEPER than either this show or SEX AND THE CITY.  However, I found this show watchable while working on some art projects.

There are some points in the script which could have used some professional consultation.  For example, at one point the husband of the woman lawyer brings a custody suit against her for her infant child when he is NOT the biological father of the child and he knows this.  He is sterile. Said biological father is the mother's law partner.  The husband was no part of any agreement for her getting pregnant this way.  It was as a result of an affair. Nevertheless, the husband sues both of them for custody and he does not even have a job!  It is beyond incredible that he could find ANY law firm to bring a case this preposterous, especially given that he has no money. If he were wealthy, I suppose he might find some firm dishonest enough to tell him he had a case just for the fees.  But he is not.

Second, the woman doctor first admitted to having sex with her patient (even though there was no proof) and was suspended from practice for a year. From this she goes straight into having an affair upon reinstatement with BOTH the married doctor who hired her AND his best friend, also a surgeon. Once again she takes ALL of the blame publicly upon herself when this all comes to light, making herself a pariah in the hospital.  Here's my question.  Has anyone ever met ANY doctor this self effacing, selfless, abasing and eternally atoning? I don't think so.

Third, Sharon Small is still married to the guy who was arrested for playing dead, pretending to be a victim of the 9/11 bombings.  Even though Small has returned the two million from the widows' fund, her life should be a non-stop legal sideshow because of him.  At the very least, he should be trying to get at his equity in the house to pay for his legal defense.  Yet NOTHING is happening as a consequence of this whatsoever! She is on to the next romance!

Finally, the promiscuous lesbian, marries a GUY and then has problems with his promiscuity even though they entered into an open marriage. Generally, the only people who make it through this kind of open marital setup are those to whom sex acts as a default solution to total ennui.  The wife here, by contrast, is a ball of fire on every level and incredibly passionate about everything. Such a person is not known for being able to share.  Certainly the way you see her kind of personality as a legal client is as the vengeful, maybe even murderous, wife, NOT as the female half of an open marriage. So, yes it is believable that she can't do it once in the marriage but it is unbelievable that she ever thought she could.

3284289,4,B0010S5Z5G,"This is really 3.5 stars for me but Amazon does not give us half stars to use in our reviews.

How much you like this show is going to depend on how much you like soap operas, whether day or evening fare.  It is upscale soap opera, however, which always sweetens the deal. The chief reason I tuned in was because Sharon Small is in it.  She played Havers on the Detective Lynley Mysteries and developed a lot of fans on this side of the pond as well as her own side.

There is another recognizable star too.  The actress who plays Olivia in the American prime time weekly series FRINGE is also in this UK series.  I did not realize she was British until I saw this show.

There is one problem with this series.  There are too many characters for only a six episode series.  Thus short shrift is given to each story instead of the longer and better study which could have been given the better ones. The best stories are of Small as the 9/11 widow with a two million pound settlement and the woman doctor who had an affair with her dying patient and then helped him die by morphine (euthanasia).  She gets involved with his son.

Less convincing are: 1) the female lawyer who has a sterile husband and gets pregnant by another lawyer in her firm and 2) the promiscuous lesbian who is all over the map on commitment issues. Both of these stories had so many variables piled onto them that they became totally unbelievable.

If you wish to see Small in a romance vehicle in which she does not have to share screen time with 3 other women's stories, I recommend you try GLASGOW KISS instead.

I did not like SEX AND THE CITY.  However, I have liked DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, although it has now seen its better days.  I would say that if you are a huge fan of SEX AND THE CITY, that you will probably also love this show.  If you are a huge fan of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, you may not, as this series is a lot gooier and sweeter than DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.

3284290,5,B0010S5Z5G,This is a highly entertaining British soap opera of sorts. Reminds me of the Amercian Sex and the City series. Story lines are fresh and decidely British in nature. If you enjoyed Desperate Housewives or Sex in the City I think you too will enjoy these grown up soap operas. I would not allow anyone under 14 years of age to watch as there is some slight nudity and very adult topics. I rate this a 5 star production.

3284292,5,B0010S5Z5G,"When people ask me what Mistresses is about, I tell them, like someone else wrote, that it's a cross between Desperate Housewives & Sex & the City.  But you actually get so much more.  There is a lot that can get you hooked:  mysteries unfolding (is Trudi really getting calls from her dead husband?), romance brewing (the lesbian relationship between Jessica & Alex), forbidden relationships (Katie with a married man!  Katie with his son?!) & train wreck in slow motion (Siobhan's infidelity).

The 4 actresses who play the ladies are very competent & have great chemistry.  My only gripe is that, how come they all have so much free time to get together?  They are often seen having drinks & dinner at each others' house, meeting up in the middle of the day after one calls another.  That seems a bit unrealistic, but I guess they have to create opportunities for the 4 leads to share the screen.

This is an appealing & addictive series, with a talented & attractive cast - highly recommended!",1250812800,3,997,4.683908045977011
3284293,4,B0010S5Z5G,"This show starts off with a ludicrous and laughable premise. A primetime soap opera about 30's something's on different sides of infidelity. As predictable and ridiculously titillating as it was, I was hooked without realizing it. As a heterosexual black male from NYC, I have to say, the Brits know how to do a drama. This show is definitely worth watching, however I am a bit perturbed at the current 5/6/09 estimated price of 41 dollars for season 1 when its only about 11-15 dollars (through the conversion) for UK viewers (they have season 1 and 2 for about 35 through conversion). If this is what we do when we export our movies and shows to Canada and the UK, then I for one apologize. Seriously, this is an amazing series.

Quickly, without spoiling too much, in the first 15 minutes or so of the first episode we discover that Dependable Trudi is a 9/11 terrorist attack widow; 6 years after loosing her husband she gets a check for 2 million pounds and meets a new guy the same day. Coincidence? The vibrant Siobhan is an attorney who is trying to make partner in her law firm, however she and her husband are attempting to have their first child. Will this interfere with her career plans? Reserved and prim Doctor Kate has found a new love in her life and is happier than she has been in a long time. So why is she keeping him a secret from her friends? The wild and promiscuous (yeah I said it) Jessica is an event planner, who occasionally writes off the hotels for her sex romps as a ""Business Expense"". Never get serious or take yourself too seriously is her rule of engagement. So what are the rules when someone makes her want more than a casual encounter?

Season 1 is only 6 episodes ( And it ends with a bang!)",1241654400,20,1731,4.423197492163009
3284294,5,B0010S5Z5G,"The BBC show Mistresses reminded me of how differently women are viewed in Europe and North America. Mistresses is obviously inspired by Sex and the City. In the British show, four women who remain friends through all kinds of hardship and emotional turmoil even share the professions of some of the characters of Sex and the City. The way these shows portray women, however, couldn't be more different.

First, the characters of Mistresses look normal. They dress like regular women, their hair looks regular. Nobody on the BBC show is trying to create an illusion that women walk around the city and even go to work in skimpy shimmery dresses and outrageous heels, all the while keeping every hair on their heads in its place.

The most striking difference, of course, is not the characters' appearance. What really attracts me to the BBC show is that the women in Mistresses aren't pathetic. It's such a relief to see women who can have all the problems in the world but still never come close to being so ridiculously pathetic as the characters of shows such as Sex and the City.

In the American show, beautiful and successful women are ready to humiliate themselves to the extreme to recieve a crumb of affection from any passing loser. Besides being absolutely unrealistic, this image of contemporary womanhood is very offensive. Mistresses, on the other hand, doesn't follow such silly stereotypes. The female characters are surrounded by normal, attractive, realistically-looking men. They follow their hearts and their bodies without repeating the word ""relationship"" every 15 seconds. When they get together, they don't spend hours figuring out what HE said and did and what it means for the relationship. The characters of Mistresses concentrate on their own feelings and desires.

Watch BBC if you want to be reminded of what feminism is supposed to be about and just how dead it is in the US.
