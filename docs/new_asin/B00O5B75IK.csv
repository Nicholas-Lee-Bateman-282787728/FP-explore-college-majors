6724787,5,B00O5B75IK,"Wonderful, uplifting movie. A film which leads one to ""never quit"" no matter what the costs may seem to be at the time...God always comes through and He will use you to accomplish His purposes if you allow Him and never give up... on anyone or yourself.",1454716800,,253,4.404255319148936

6724793,1,B00O5B75IK,"Not the worst movie I've seen but it's pretty bad. The acting was not believable, the script isn't either, and the story is so cliched and at the same time unnatural. It's just not believeable at all. Some of the lines were so corny and the ""climax"" of the movie came out of nowhere and was laughable. Don't see it. Please. It doesn't do God or Christians justice.",1432944000,4,364,4.367647058823529

6724795,5,B00O5B75IK,Very straight forward view of beginning a Christian walk.  The actors model some of the struggles of beginning a faith journey.,1429315200,4,127,5.0476190476190474

6724799,2,B00O5B75IK,"Spoiler? A misfit 17 year old Christian orphan is mad at God and then he reconciles with his beliefs and everything gets better. The acting is very unnatural and the climax happens suddenly seemingly like the movie left out a big part of the orphan's religious journey.

If you're used to indie Christian films you'll probably enjoy this movie but if you're used to professional movies you probably won't.",1423267200,5,405,4.869565217391305

8682222,5,B00O5B75IK,The movies portrays a 17 year old boy who has been rejected all his life by one person or family. It shows how bitter he has become because of rejection and how through Christian love he makes a complete turn around. Accepting the love of people in his life and especially Christ into his heart. This is great Christian family entertainment.,1478044800,,341,4.60655737704918
