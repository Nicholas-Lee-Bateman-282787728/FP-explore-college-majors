Right from the get go, the narrator's way of talking, I knew this video was old!
It's a nice, slow paced video if you want to know some past history and the land. It's in-depth enough but as the review said, outdated. I just can't figure out what year it's made though. No cell phones, the clothes, etc..
No year in credits either....I looked hard! And this bugs me.",1522540800,,463,4.333333333333333
