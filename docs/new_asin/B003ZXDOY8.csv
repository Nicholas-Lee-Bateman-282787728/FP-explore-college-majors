8597924,3,B003ZXDOY8,"First I will say it is unfair for me to review this film as a white male who watched 20-30 minutes and turned it off. The movie is a play with your basic overhead shot. It also shows characters with ear/mouth pieces hooked to boxes. There is music and comedy with some sexual references. Our main character has a hunk of a bf which she uses for sex, but the guy is a lot of talk. Her family fixes her up with a man who has wealth, but he may not be the legal businessman he pretends to be. It was at this point I couldn't watch any more. The fact that it was done on a stage for a theater distracted me from the film as well as the severe lack of action. Worse than Sister Act 2 in my book. I am sure there is a niche for this type of stage drama-musical-comedy, but it was not my cup of tea.",1304640000,,792,3.8650306748466257
