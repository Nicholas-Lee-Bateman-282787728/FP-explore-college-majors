8166823,1,B000M66XT4,"Warning. I bought one of these and it was a pirated DVD copied off of TV by the vendor... who included his own ad on the DVD.

This was a very poor quality TV copy. Looks like it was copied from an old homemade VHS tape! This is a homemade DVD someone copied at their home..... and this DVD has trouble working right.

Save your money. They plan to release new copies of all the Dallas movies after they finish releasing the TV series seasons. These will be available soon in the next year or two. You can go up on the internet to read the latest Dallas news on their release plans.

Don't waste your money on these thieves. Wait for the professional release. It will be better quality for 1/6th the price.",1231977600,57,706,4.253731343283582
