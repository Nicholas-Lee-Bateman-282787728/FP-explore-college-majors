Caruso died not long after of throat cancer (what a horror of irony that is), and Pavarotti died a few years ago (that is cataclysmic and shouldn't have been allowed).  They talk about Disney having preserved himself cryogenically...no no this is the thing that should have been done with Pavarotti.  Like burning the finest Steinway or Strad.

Anyway, there is a 2nd performance of Nessun Dorma, done as a trio, which is funny and beautiful.  Though Caruso didn't seem to blend as well as Pavarotti and Domingo, it's more of a taking turns bit.  Incredible strength, musicianship, grace, and camaraderie.

Cherish cherish cherish this while it's still available...and cherish Domingo as well while he's still around.  It may be the end of a great age of opera....hope not.",1369958400,,932,4.817610062893082

This is a marvelous album. Beautiful voices and music.  I may not be qualified to critique the voices of the tenors, but ""I know what I like,"" to borrow a phrase from someone. If  you like classical music sung by the three tenors, this album is for you!",1356307200,,318,4.431034482758621
357817,5,6301793196,"Prequel: It is not possible for reviewers to write separate reviews of the single and of the two disc deluxe versions even though they are not the same. This is a listing arrangement beyond the control of reviewers. Consequently this review covers both options together so please be patient and extract whichever information applies to your particular interests. Thanks, Ian Giles.

.....................................

This original version of the original three tenors concerts given in Rome in 1990 was much copied but never matched for the sense of a unique and very special occasion. The actual recording is given good sound presented in stereo and DD 5.1 surround sound. The imaging is adequate by today's standards on close ups and only breaks up on distance shots. The camera work itself gives a good sense of immediacy and involvement - probably much better than being there at the time!

The selection of music, largely from opera and operetta, is unashamedly popular and is performed with total skill and a performance-aware delivery that positively invites increasingly enthusiastic audience support. All three singers are in good voice, probably more so than on the sequence of such concerts that followed. It would be easy for this to become a competitive activity, and so it is to a degree, but all three men are able to unite for the two encores - two Pavarotti specials ('O sole mio' and 'Nessun dorma') that are shared out between them with great camaraderie. Otherwise any competition is good humoured and fully understood as an essential ingredient to a very joyous occasion.

Everyone who buys this disc will have favourites in terms of aria and in terms of singer. Nevertheless, it would be hard to imagine anyone experiencing disappointment. Both Mehta and his orchestra accompany with evident enjoyment, rising to the occasion, including the orchestra only items which give the singers a bit of a 'breather' and add a touch of aural variety.

The booklet in the original single disc version provides all the texts and other basic information. The later 'deluxe' two disc set, published in 2007, provides subtitles which is a far preferable option to the supplied texts of the first version. There are no texts supplied in the abbreviated booklet of the deluxe version. The later deluxe version is not significantly sonically or visually superior to the first version and this has been carefully compared. The second disc in the deluxe version provides a second disc a documentary describing the creation of this concert narrated by Derek Jacobi. There is also a track enabling those who wish to join in a karaoke version of 'O sole mio.'

The single disc, or two disc deluxe version, of this unique concert and occasion cannot be compared to others and can confidently be recommended to anyone who finds the idea of such an event an attraction. That is why it has been such a top seller ever since it was issued.",1343520000,,2938,4.985714285714286
357851,5,6301793196,"Not only do you have a great concert on this dvd, but there's special features!!! And if you're into classical music, then I'm sure you've noticed that a lot of operatic dvds seem to lack any kind of special features. The documentary included isn't just the boring stuff that goes into making such an event, but there's humor and moments that are pretty touching. I highly suggest this dvd for any fan of The Three Tenors or music in general!",1327276800,,442,4.5375
357857,5,6301793196,I bought this for my mother-in-law and she loves it.  She enjoys sitting down to watch it just as much as she enjoys it as background music.  She even puts it on for my 2-1/2 year old son and he is captivated by the music.,1280188800,,222,3.911111111111111
357962,5,6301793196,"There will always be naysayers when it comes to this kind of project--the commercialization of classical or operatic music has its downside, I'm sure.  But the Three Tenors concerts really did help win the hearts of many who were previously unfamiliar with the genre.  It's hard to argue that that's not a good thing.

However, I understand why purists are--at the very least--ambivalent about projects like this. It's at least as much show-biz as art. But then again, one of the first things they teach you about Opera in music appreciation class is that it was originally a popular art form, and if three of the greatest tenors of the latter 20th century could help re-popularize the genre once more, well, it's all to the good, right?

OK, there is the worry of over-commercialization.. The Three Tenors did become something of a brand name while they lasted--and mygosh all those spin-offs: 3 Irish Tenors, 2 Mo' Tenors, 3 Terrors (yes, they existed!), to say nothing of the soprano ensembles. All talented, I'm sure, but it gets to be a bit much.  You're almost tempted to say they created a monster.

But there were just so many good moments, especially when it was all fresh and new as it was for the first concert. Of course, Pavarotti's ""Nessun Dorma"" has justifiably become a popular classic, but Domingo's ""No Puede Ser"" and Carreras' ""Granada"" are almost as memorable. And when the three join forces on a reprise of ""Nessun Dorma,"" well, you forget any concerns you may have about crass commercialism and just enjoy these three beautiful voices blending beautifully.

Carreras' begins the program with ""Lamento di Federico,"" and he's just shaky enough that you wonder if his return to performing after having beaten leukemia wasn't perhaps a bit premature. But he gets progressively stronger and more assured as the evening wears on. You come to share in his sense of triumph.

I remember at the time that this concert was first broadcast on PBS, a co-worker of mine--an otherwise tough-talking dame in her 60s--declared herself to be a ""Domingo gal."" And you can see why. His easy going masculinity and dashing looks clearly make him the hearthrob of the program. His voice has always struck me as being deeper and richer than most tenors, and I'm not surprised that he is taking on baritone roles in his later career. Of the ""Three Tenors,"" he's really the only one who could likely pull off such a move.

His much vaunted ambition and adventureness is evident even in this limited a program. He tackles pieces in German, French and English with a bit more ease than Carreras (while Pavarotti only seldom ventures from standard Italian repertoire).

In some ways though, the two Spaniards seem almost deferential to Pavarotti, the sole Italian and therefore (at least by some definitions) more of the heir to the operatic tradition. He was, in some ways, the most imperious, while being somewhat indifferent, it seemed, to his personal appearance. It may seem petty to wonder why he didn't bother to trim his beard, but it did appear almost defiantly unkempt. Nothing ragged about his vocals here, however. It's hard to imagine a more gorgeous instrument.

Newcomers to the world of opera could watch this broadcast in 1991 and experience firsthand how distinctive these singers were, what each could bring to a given piece--be it an operatic aria or a Neapolitan (or Spanish) song. They could also experience the emotion and the HUMOR that was characteristic of great singers' concerts. All in all, a good intro to the genre. And a brilliant commercial move--not that there's anything wrong with that.",1238544000,2,3616,4.901800327332242

357964,5,6301793196,"I'm not going to repeat what others have said about this concert - we already know they're brilliant.

I just wanted to clarify what's in this DVD as compared to other Three Tenors DVD's:

This is a 2-disc box set, which contains the original concert (1.5 hours) plus a 1-hour documentary on the tenors. It also contains extras, a karaoke ""extra"", and other bonus material.

I hope this helps - if you want to own this classic on DVD, I definitely think the box set is worth the extra dollar.

Enjoy!",1236556800,48,500,4.461538461538462
358058,5,6301793196,"This dvd was purchased as an early Mother's Day Present for my elderly mother. She has watched it nearly every night because she can't get enough. As an opera lover myself, absolutely loved the Karoeke of O Sole Mio! We were totally surprised about the ""Impossible Dream"" dvd of the making of this ""historic"" video.

358172,5,6301793196,"These are the masters of the genre, hands down!!! And this collection presents their best in composition and delivery. They deserve the reputation and accolade. I wish the sound was a bit more refined and clear. I give it five stars.",1196553600,,233,4.7073170731707314
358175,5,6301793196,"All the good things that have been said about the (long previously available) US format of this DVD are true for this one too.  This was the concert that made opera popular, and Pavarotti a household name (Domingo and Carreras each got to be ""one of the other three tenors"" - until much later).  And the reason it did that was primarily due to a) their song choice - including popular numbers such as Tonight, from West Side Story, for instance, broke down the perceived divide between opera singers and the average music listener; and b) the mischievous playfulness of Domingo and Carreras' reply to Pavarotti's fioratura in the encore - along with Pavarotti's astonishment and hearty spontaneous laughter in response.  These might be opera singers, but they were having fun, and the audience, live and televised, had fun with them.

I've been waiting for more than a decade for this DVD to come out, continually frustrated by trying to order the other format only to be told ""it won't work in Australian DVD players"".  My only gripe is that they changed the cover - why should we Aussies not be able to have the original cover too?

Watching it with the benefit of nearly 20 years hindsight, perhaps what it shows most clearly is how developed Pavarotti's voice was at that time compared with Domingo and Carreras, both of whom have since become much more equal competition for Luciano.  That said, nothing hides the sheer magic of Pavarotti as a singer.  Long may the DVDs live as a testimony to him.  Vale Luciano!",1192320000,21,1518,4.71969696969697
358178,5,6301793196,"This is one of those events, whether musical or otherwise, that comes along once a generation.  The result is that everyone remembers where they were when....

In my case, I was pottering around at home, blissfully unaware of anything, when my Dad phoned me and said ""Turn on your TV - three guys are singing beautifully.""  I did, and the rest is history.

I'm a professional musician and can't pull out bits or say where people were better than others.  Pavarotti was aureate and majestic, his great bulk filling the space, singing with his entire face....Jose Carreras wonderfully intense and sensitive, like the younger brother, keen to impress and seeking approval (later bravely to fight his own health battles)....and Domingo was mischievous and competitive.

Zubin Mehta held the whole event together brilliantly, part authoritative, part conspiratorial.  In the magical setting of Caracalla, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.

It was the best jam session ever, and if you haven't seen it, you've been deprived.  If you have, you'll want it again.",1189382400,55,1069,5.062857142857143
358404,5,6301793196,"As a long time Tenor fan, from the days of Enrico, this is a MAster work. It does not get any better. Luciano Pavarotti showed himself as the Master of all, with some great perfomances by each, Placido Domingo performs a master work with his rendition of No Puede Ser. The encore of the the three is awesome! The double of O sole mio at the end is a fantastic blend of audible and interactive talent. If there is one you must buy, this is it. Will",985219200,12,447,4.149425287356322
358405,5,6301793196,"This concert, along with the Rome concert, were the two best the Tenors have ever done. The Tenors all seemed to be at the same level, in terms of sweetness, and richness. However, there was one clear standout. Luciano Pavarotti, with his good ear,  makes him absolutely phenomenal, and he is always in tune, with all the right notes at all the right times. All his arias were outstanding, but the one that most impressed me was Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's ""Turandot"". His pronunciation was perfect, (no wonder, he's Italian) and the singing was beautiful. Carreras sang Granada very well, with pretty good pronunciation, and a sweet tone. Domingo did an excellent job singing, ""No puede ser"". The he puts the notes with the words is just great. The orchestra of two-hundred, under the command of Zubin Metha was excellent. If there was such a thing as ""6-star"" rating, this video would get it.",978134400,10,895,4.811688311688312
358407,4,6301793196,"This remains my favourite of the three big concerts done in conjunction  with the World Cup. The participation of 2 full orchestras instead of one  is appropriate for such a major event, and they were rehearsed until they  sounded as one large orchestra instead of two, which apparently was quite a  difficult task. This was a welcoming of Jose Carreras into the music  community after his terrible ordeal with leukemia. My favourite parts are  when the tenors sing together, and since Domingo's voice is quite baritonal  - he has done The Barber of Seville recently - whereas Pavarotti's tenor is  at the highest range, and Carrera's is in the middle, they can all be heard  quite clearly without overpowering each other.  The programming is  interesting too, and the fioratura duel between them in 'o sole mio adds an  original touch to the production. I believe Mehta conducted as well in this  concert as he did in Los Angeles 4 years later.  The audio quality is very  fine too and better, based on my experience at a show in Vancouver BC a few  years ago, than what one is likely to hear at a Three Tenors live concert.  The picture does have some vertical oscillations, probably due to the use  of hand-held cameras, which does detract from the concert's overall quality  - hence 4 stars instead of 5.
This can be warmly recommended in either  VHS or DVD, although the latter format has slightly better sound and video  quality.",965520000,37,1435,4.705645161290323
358408,5,6301793196,I was very impressed by the results of the DVD much less the  the Three Great Tenors of the World and having surround sound set up it is just incredible. It was like you could breathe the air right there in the  Concert 1990 in Rome.,955584000,2,233,4.043478260869565
