5115741,4,B0080JG2C8,"Good low budget film if u like Italian mob flicks of modern times. Ok,alright the blood looked fake but the plot was really good. Unlike what one viewer said, the end didn't fizzle out & took me off guard. Spoiler alert!  I thought it was gonna be a happy ending for someone but I won't say anymore other than I enjoyed the movie. Oh!  And there were a few veteran actors in it which made the storyline believable. One more thing...I'm impressed that the director also wrote the screenplay :)",1410480000,,492,4.455555555555556
5115742,4,B0080JG2C8,"Wow, this is a very graphic description and portrayal of life on the inside of Good Fellas which ain't all that Good when seen from this perspective.  Shotgunned in an alley is a very hard way to go and having your heads removed by chain saw ain't all that pleasant either!",1409875200,,273,4.352941176470588

5115745,4,B0080JG2C8,"if someone thirst for a gritty mafia flick this is the one; it puts you in the mind of the movie ""good fellas"" on a much smaller scale.  A lot slower, you have to pay attention to the small details to catch the punch line, but its a good movie.",1400630400,,244,3.88
5115746,1,B0080JG2C8,"a blood and gore disappointment. brutal killers with their absurd code of ""honor"" (""Dishonor"" is more appropriate.) don't bother watching it.",1392163200,,141,5.761904761904762
5115747,2,B0080JG2C8,"The ""plot"" was not engaging enough and I just couldn't get to watch more than 30 minutes of this movie.  The filming looked like a movie made with a camcorder.  The acting was also quite inconsistent.  I'm pretty sure that it is done on purpose for artistic reasons.  Simply not my cup of tea so I made no further excuses and stopped right there.",1379721600,,346,4.359375
5115748,2,B0080JG2C8,It was a slow thrill that fizzled out at the end. Low budget flick with substandard actors and actresses. Drink some coffee prior to watching this movie to prevent you from falling asleep.,1365984000,,188,4.7272727272727275
5115749,5,B0080JG2C8,"I love this movie. It's the most realistic of any organized crime film I have ever seen. It's funny, gritty, and teaches a hard lesson in what revenge really means. I really dig this film!",1363564800,2,188,4.4
5115750,3,B0080JG2C8,"Written and directed by one of the Jerky Boys, Brutal is far better than that might herald, but far weaker than it could have been with some loose ends tied up more neatly.

There are some quite good things here---most of the acting, most of the script---but the negatives really drag it down. Specifically the astonishingly bad looping: there's lots of it, and sometimes it's literally high school film project bad. Four guys sitting in a car talking and they all sound two inches from their individual mics? Then the exact same sound quality when they're walking down the street? It just kills the sense of reality the film tries so hard to achieve in other ways.

Still, if you like this genre you'll find stuff to enjoy in Brutal. Some of the standard mob actors are here, at least one Soprano vet (as is now mandated by The Union in all wiseguy flicks), and there's way less Hollywood cheese vibe than many mob movies; this one feels quite NYC real at its best moments. The leads all feel mostly right, and Greene is typically sleaze deeluxe.

But besides the sound issues and scenes that don't move the plot or characters one inch forward, there are more than a few glaring plot holes, like when one major character gets whacked while playing cards with his boys and not one of them pulls a gun to protect him or themselves while the shooter slowly reloads his shotgun. Come on. Plus various other pretty glaring no-way-could-that-ever-happens. That's the problem with going for total real-feel: when you miss, it stands out twice as much.

In short, if you like mob/heist flicks, and nasty people---there's not one character here really worth feeling much for---you'll dig this. But I'd watch Goodfellas and GF 1 and 2 etc again instead if you want the real deal.",1347926400,2,1770,4.7

5115761,1,B0080JG2C8,This was a shameful Italian Mobster Movie. I lost interest in the first 10 minutes after the scene with the dead rabbbit on the table not even skinned or gutted. The scene sucked because the mother is talking in her native language but the son responds in English and there is no Close Caption text for the translation of what the mother is saying. So nobody knows what she is saying unless they understand Italian. I feel like it fails to show respect  to the people whom they are portraying. I didn't realize it was a comedy movie. I don't know any Italians that take the family's pet rabbit and butcher it and throw it into a plate on the table.,1443744000,,648,4.355371900826446
5115762,1,B0080JG2C8,"This creation was about as unbearable as using a wire brush in place of that fluffy paper usually found in scented rolls.  This was a tale about lifelong criminals?  More like,  a fairy tale written by people whose only contact (big maybe, here) with crime was to have been a victim.  A real wise guy, or wise guy's 12 year old nephew,  or  5 year old grand daughter would have had more 'street smarts' than ANY mooks in this plodding travesty exhibited.  This film's plot was cobbled together by simpletons who apparently believe that a double-barrel shotgun is the answer to all tactical issues...their ignorance is spelled out by the baseball-size red spots daubed on Mr. Bookie's tee shirt when our Brooklyn Mope tromps down the gold-pattern-wallpapered basement stairs,  says his burp of a speech,  and spits out FOUR 12 ga. shells without even shredding his target's undershirt!  The unfortunates who made this film created a miracle...a story that made the semi-big-time,  yet didn't have the tiniest crumb of realism in it.  I tip my hat to youse all.  Makin' nuttin' outta even less...dat takes some original thought!  A better title would have been:  ""The Mob,  As Seen By People With Ten Weeks Of Film School And NO Weeks On The Streets They Seek To Portray.""

5115783,3,B0080JG2C8,"So the movie was an OK gangster movie with the stereotypical Italian 'tough' guys.  They get in over there head, blah, blah.  Not really a bad movie.  The action scenes and the like were pretty good; but when the characters got deep and emotional it really plodded and bad acting came out... especially the main character's wife... she was terrible.  All the characters got pretty bad during those type of scenes, but when they were loud and obnoxious (as movies like this make us think of Italians) they were pretty good. I think this movie's big problem was that I didn't care what happened to the main characters; I didn't care if they lived or died because I didn't feel connected to the characters or their plight.  In the end it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.",1416614400,,773,4.572463768115942

The acting and plot were real and raw, I could not stop after the first minute I was in until the dramatic end.

The boys are each unique and a compelling group with too much mob influence in their homes and lives. The injustices of life got them into a situation they unfortunately could not get out of - at all. Their network wasn't properly developed under the guidance of a mentor. They were young, brave, and vulnerable in a merciless game to which they were not invited.

Of course, I'm cheering the boys on even while they're losing. They extracted a pound of flesh so they were not losers as losers go.

8523612,2,B0080JG2C8,"I already wanted to see 1000 Times More Brutal before I found out the ex member of The Jerky Boys Kamal Ahmed wrote & directed it but after I found out, it made me want to see it even more. The movie starts out r....e....a....l slow but after 30+ minutes in, things start to get interesting & it was good from then on. It's definitely worth waiting around for. I think my favorite thing about the movie was not just the bits of humor here & there but that it wasn't a BIG Hollywood production. If it was, it wouldn't have been as good. The characters felt real like you actually might run into them on the street even though you wouldn't want to. The movie wasn't full of well manicured lawns, shiny brand new cars, HUGE houses out of something on Extreme Home Makeover or any of that typical Hollywood garbage that they like to put into each & every movie they make. If you like Mafia/Crime movies then I think you might like 1000 Times More Brutal (Why not give it a shot?) Kamal Ahmed picked out the perfect title for this movie because not only was the beginning brutal but the ending was as well. It comes out of nowhere & then, BAM!!!
