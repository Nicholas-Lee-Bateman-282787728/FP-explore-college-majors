8042271,4,B0006Q93AG,"I bought this just for Soul Man, love James Marsters in anything he is in and I was not disappointed.  Just not long enough to suit me..not enough of James.",1233014400,3,156,4.2
8042272,2,B0006Q93AG,"I purchased this set for the ""Soul Man"" segment starring James Marsters and Roger Daltrey.  None of the four stories, however is all that engaging despite having some notable actors taking part.  The stories are somewhat predictable, the acting is uneven (Peter Strauss appears to be sleepwalking through his performance although his segment is perhaps the most interesting), and since each of them is rather brief you have little time to be engaged by the characters even when the actors have something to work with.  Best rented rather than purchased, I doubt many will want to review these stories more than once.",1174262400,5,616,5.019607843137255
