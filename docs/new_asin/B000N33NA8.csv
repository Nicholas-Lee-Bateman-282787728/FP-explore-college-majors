8174306,5,B000N33NA8,"I've been watching a few Polish movies lately just to see if I remember any Polish from my long past childhood.  This was the best movie so far.  It really is very funny.  All the other movies I saw were long and mostly boring, but this is worth watching for enjoyment.  You don't have to understand the language; it has subtitles.  The characters are a hoot and the acting is really good.",1236816000,3,389,4.347222222222222
