Ultimately only a love affair with a 13 year old boy - who in many ways is the most mature character in the film - gives her joy.

Transgressive, uncomfortable, surreal and tweaking both sides of the war of the sexes equally; men are fools who can only look at women through a narrow prism, and women are complex and weird to the point ofabsurdity, this is a film that makes me laugh and cringe (in a good way) in equal measure.",1457654400,,674,4.2578125
