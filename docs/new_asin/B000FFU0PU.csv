8157954,5,B000FFU0PU,"I was born in mainland China and watched the Chinese New Year Global Gala by NTDTV in the past three years. This is a great show, very traditional, very classic. If you are interested in Chinese culture, this is a must have collection. My 3 year old daughter loves this DVD set. She could watch the dances for hours and mimic the traditional Chinese dancing movements. People always ask us whether we sent her to professional dancing school but actually she learned everything by watching this DVD. We are so proud of her and thank so much that NTDTV produced such a great show! Some of the highlights of this DVD set can be viewed on this website [...] so if you want to get a peek about what is inside, you can take a look there.",1170633600,,731,4.343065693430657
