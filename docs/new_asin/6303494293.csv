7849954,5,6303494293,I have been using this and another tape alternately for years.  They are excellent.  I have tried others but do not get the results that this delivers.,1368835200,,151,4.555555555555555
7849955,5,6303494293,"This video is the best workout for low impact aerobics I have seen.  It is easy to follow for those of us who can't do intricate dance steps, gets the heart pumping, and does all the right moves.  Too bad it is not on DVD.  I keep my VHS machine around just for this video.",1347235200,,273,3.9272727272727272
7849956,5,6303494293,"I've been using this tape to stay fit off and on since 1990. Even though I've tried other workouts, I always end up coming back to this series (body shaping and stretching are also my favorites). The quality might not be the best, but the routines are easy to learn and not too contemporary. It's an honest, real aerobic workout that never loses it's effectiveness.",1255564800,,365,4.630769230769231
7849957,1,6303494293,"I need low impact aerobics because of my knee joints, but this one will never be used. The film production is poor quality. It looks unprofessional and sometimes cuts off the feet of the instructor so you can't see what she is doing. There are four people doing the routine, all with zero personality. There is no motivation, no jokes, no encouragement, and the speaker's voice is monotone. There is no way to know what steps are next because the leader tells you the move as she begins to do it, or afterwards. Gilad has low impact tapes and so does Jane Fonda. Both are much better than this one.",1155168000,2,598,4.445454545454545
