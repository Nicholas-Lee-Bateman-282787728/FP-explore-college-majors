Plot:  Dr. Stubbs (who was a prodigy and is obsessed with his experiment) is launching a special ship called ""The Egg"" that will be launched into a star just before it goes ""BOOM"".  Meanwhile, Wesley is experimenting with nanites, microbe-sized robots that can enter living cells (later, in ""The Best of Both Worlds Part 2"", Data and Dr. Crusher suggest using this guys to knock out the Borg, but it would take to long to ""breed"" them, so they didn't) and a couple escape.  To make things worse, they're in the computer core, eating the little computer chips to their delight (which for some reason leads them to ""evolve"", hence the episode's title) which causes the ship to go haywire.  Well, now the decision is either to try and reason with these little pests or simply exterminate them.  Dr. Stubbs is for the latter, so that his experiment can continue uninterrupted.  Picard would rather try and communicate with the nanites and hopefully solve it diplomatically.

I much prefer this episode over ""The Quality of Life"", because the reasoning is far better.  For one thing, the Enterprise always has the option of wiping out the nanites at any point, but they don't.  Another thing is that someone isn't putting someone else at extreme risk of getting killed (like in the aforementioned episode) for something that ""may be alive"", when they're putting something that is alive in jeopardy.  While the ""non-living thing evolving so that they're alive and self-conscious"" can get a little wearisome in being addressed over and over again, this is one of the better ones.

Gets a nice, solid 5 out of 5 stars.",1158451200,,1667,4.807017543859649
7844293,5,6303359140,"For the first show of the third season (you thought these were in the correct order?), Beverly Crusher is back as Chief Medical Officer, the Starfleet uniforms now look a whole lot better, and yet another eminent scientist causes trouble on the Enterprise.  Dr. Paul Stubbs is going to study a rare phenomenon that happens only once every 197 years, as matter builds up on the surface of a star before exploding.  But as the time comes to do this once in an every third lifetime experiment, the Enterprise's computer systems mysterious start to fail and Stubbs is coming apart at the seams at the idea that the mission may be scrubbed.  However, it is not fate that is conspiring against the good doctor but Wesley Crusher.  As part of a genetics experiment the ship's resident boy genius was working on Nanites, microscopic machines designed to make repairs on the cells of living tissues.  Wesley upgraded the Nanites, teaching them to work together, to reproduce and to otherwise evolve.  When two of his new and improve Nanites escaped, the result was that the computer core eventually was invaded by thousands of Nanites where they are happy and content, eating the memory chips.  Ultimately they threaten not only Stubbs' experiment, but also the Enterprise's life-support systems.  No one promised fair, but Stubbs is ready to go off the deep end on this one.
This is another one of those Next Generation episodes that focuses on the issue of sentience.  We have dealt with Androids (""The Measure of a Man,"" Episode 35), holographic characters (""Elementary, My Dear Data,"" Episode 29), and crystals (""Home Soil,"" Episode 17), so now we deal with ""living machines.""  Dr. Stubbs wants to exterminate the Nanites and proceed with his experiment.  Of course, Captain Picard refuses to destroy out of hand what may well be a new species just because they are eating his computer.  They might be small and a new life form, but Picard always likes to look at the big picture.  Perhaps one of the biggest ironies of the Star Trek universe is that it is a Starfleet captain, the Federation's ""military"" wing if you will, who is the voice of conscience and reason.  When I watched ""Evolution"" again I knew it was an above average episode but I was surprised at how strong it was, mainly because it really does not have any major weaknesses.  I ended up giving it 5 stars because I liked Dr. Stubbs' mental relaxation technique of playing a baseball game in his mind, foreshadowing one of the more interesting character traits of future DS9 Captain Benjamin Sisko.",973123200,,2560,4.812785388127854
