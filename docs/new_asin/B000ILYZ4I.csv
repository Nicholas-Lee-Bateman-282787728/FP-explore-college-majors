8146225,4,B000ILYZ4I,"The author believes that a nuclear powered UFO flying over Russia in 1908 blew up in the air leaving physical proof, see ""Radioactivity at Tunguska"". The UFO was possibly using a MHD generator heated by a Nuclear reactor. The pilot likely had no idea that it was set to go off.  The force of the blast was over 10 times the force that created the gigantic Meteor Crater in Arizona. Russia citizens died of radiation sickness.  After writer Alexander Kazantsev visited Hiroshima, he realized that Tunguska was likely caused by a nuclear space craft and published this in 1946 as a story. This idea was held in secret according to Russian officer testimony. Since it was believed that the US solely possessed this technology, Russia most likely blamed us for the Tunguska blast. The Cold War started in 1947. Russia keep their suspicions secret while recovering from WW2.  We distanced ourselves by selected wars thousands of miles away.  The Cold War ended in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall and Russia opened up expeditions to Tunguska in 1991. Tunguska is connected again with the Cold War. With a fully developed nuclear reactor, and the first MHD generator in 1936 (patent 2,210,918), it is conceivable that we could have developed this technology by 1958. MHD technology is earth based. The radioactivity suggest it was developed 50 years in advance by some secret group.  Further tests would risk exposure. Coincidentally, both sides of WW2 were developing it.  Advance civilizations probably use another form of technology.",1403049600,,1536,5.003921568627451
8146226,4,B000ILYZ4I,"Enough objective research has been done in the last 100 years to analyze and understand the impact of Tunguska. What makes Tunguska unique is the radial impact to the taiga forest far from any human settlement - no debris on the ground. Coupled with the wet taiga, you cannot walk around in the area. This book provides a small view with some, but not all, answers.",1380672000,,365,4.545454545454546
8146227,1,B000ILYZ4I,"Do not buy this video.  It is amateur at best.  I was looking to purchase the History Channel's ""Big Bang in Tunguska"" but it is nowhere to be found, probably because they have a slightly newer video on the same topic.  Either way, this video is repackaged from a late 1990s short full of misinformation and conspiracy nonsense, and claiming that the only plausible explanation is a UFO explosion.  The packaging and Amazon description says it is 50 minutes - the program itself is actually only a half an hour.  The quality looks like someone took a half-worn-out VHS tape and did a home job of transferring it to DVD.  A waste of money and time.",1364601600,3,647,4.5344827586206895
8146228,5,B000ILYZ4I,"I was amazed by this story. To think that there was a 40 megaton explosion in 1908 that could be seen thousands of miles away. People don't realize that a 40 megaton blast is bigger then any atomic bombs the US dropped in WW2. The documentary shows rare archival film footage of the center of where the blast zone was and a picture  paints a thousand words. The footage shows hundreds of square miles of forestland that is flattened as far as the eye can see. The devastation is still prevalent, even to this day. The DVD even includes a rare interview of a person who, as a small child, witnessed the event. Also included is an interview of a Russian Military Officer who speaks about a cover-up by the Soviet Military due to the discovery of possible UFO crash debre found at the site. I must also mention that this DVD comes with bonus features that the other reviewer somehow overlooked. Included in this DVD is a film archive of rare film footage that shows the devastation at Tunguska. Also included are two interviews with scientists from NASAs - Jet Propulsion Laboratory talking about the debate of what really happened in Tunguska back in 1908. This is a great story and a great DVD containing all of the facts about this shocking and amazing event in history.",1260144000,5,1270,4.5701754385964914
