6061761,5,B00G6SO7A4,"Rampage is easily the best Uwe Boll film ever. I know that's not saying much, but it's a pretty freakin awesome movie none the less. It's basically Postal, but not funny, and awesome instead of stupid. It takes the majority of it's philosophy from the book Ishmael, which was a wonderful book, and had nothing to do with murderous rampages, but everything to do with the concept of the Givers and the Takers, which I will not go into in this review. The bottom line is; if you like brutal awesome movies, check this out, if you like crybaby sissy movies, don't.",1276214400,4,561,4.509803921568627
6061762,1,B00G6SO7A4,"Interesting but quite tasteless! The protagonist Bill Williamson, seems to forget that he too is part of the problem and even partakes in the spoils. Many of us are angry at many things, but like most so-called self righteous beings, they kill the ""innocent"". While Bill's actions are that of someone who is mentally challenged, it somewhat contradicts his actions regarding his planning before and after the event. Then again, many serial killers are not stupid. I think that while the film is shot effectively well and holds your attention, it doesn't do any justice to the so-called cause Bill is claiming and it is quite an irresponsible piece. Still, it's the writers and director's artistic expression and perhaps their views. If you have lost someone in similar incidents then you'll see this film for what it is. Just stop to think for a moment, who are you to judge me and to take my life?",1275782400,8,898,4.762820512820513
6061763,4,B00G6SO7A4,"Yes, the apocalypse is upon us!  Finally, a good film from Uwe Boll! :)  I say that in complete jest.  Mr. Boll's work has been surrounded by a lot of contentious debate regarding its quality, in which even he himself has been involved - and I don't want to get into here.  With that said, I can truly say this movie was a huge surprise, surpassing all of my expectations - and then some!  I heard good things about the film quite some time ago, and eagerly rushed out to rent it when I found out it had been released.

The plot is quite simple: a trouble young man (early 20s) is taken to the limits and beyond by various stressors and goes on a bloody rampage.  (The title may have clued you in a bit!)  While the plot is simple, the story contains some very interesting twists and turns, which I'll leave to the viewers to find out for themselves.  The film is powerful, gripping, ultra-violent, and, in some ways, thought provoking.  It's partially shot in what can be described as ""documentary style"" - i.e. shaky cameras, chase footage, etc - but not entirely.  Some of the film is more traditional in its approach to capture the on screen events, and does so with a fairly high level of production.  Even the documentary style shots don't come across like the ""Blair Witch.""  They're much more polished.  There is no ""rock"" soundtrack or catchy theme music, and the film doesn't try to portray the seemingly mindless violence that is at its core as entertainment.  Rather, the film is more of a documentary of a trouble person, who on the outside seems lost, but inside is revealed to be quite clever and calculating.  The overall filmmaking approach makes for a truly powerful film.  From scene to scene, the suspense is tangible and you'll hold your breath waiting for events to unfold - at least, I did.

The few faults I found were regarding some weak/stiff acting by certain - secondary - characters in the film, and a few special effects that seemed cheaply done, something which, in my opinion, breaks the suspension of disbelief.  But taken with the numerous positive aspects of the film, they fail to detract a significant amount from the film.

I highly recommend this film.  It's not an action film, and it's not a horror film.  In fact, I don't really know under what cinematic genre this film should be placed.  I think the film stands on its own as a violent and captivating portrayal of one young man's downward spiral (a term used in the film, which is exceedingly appropriate).  It's easily Uwe Boll's best work - by far!  Don't let disappointment in his prior efforts turn you off. Check out this film!

Enjoy,

6061764,2,B00G6SO7A4,"Wouldnt be so bad if they didn't take their camera training from the school of The Blair Witch Project. Not a single level camera view in this film. If you get motion sick from movies stay away from this trash. I can only imagine that they let a 3 year old film this.

Also the plot holes are annoying. This man shot probably 100lbs of ammo that he apparently carried on his body. He was able to shoot 200 round mags, cops cant hit, his plates are bullet proof, a bullet doesnt have any impact to him, the cops at the end don't try to pit him.... etc. I get that its a film but some of this stuff plus the bad camera shooting just makes me sick.",1522886400,,645,4.0390625

I say that to you having just viewed the best Uwe Boll movie. Is that a low standard? Sure. It's far better than I could have expected.
Is it perfect? hell no.
You'll see the usual mistakes. Some parts drag. The first half is very repetetive. A lot of shots from later in the movie inserted again and again as foreshadowing. A lot of the same sound clips repeated. One part is ripped straight out of Falling Down. . . . it's not that bad though, but it's pretty obvious what inspired it. Once the action starts though, it doesn't really stop. The comedic moments are actually funny, and the ending is completely unexpected.

I don't recommend this to people who ""cringe"" at ""edgy"" things.
I don't recommend this to people who pretend they didn't like Donnie Darko and Fight Club because it's not cool to like those flicks anymore.
I do recommend this to people who play a lot of GTA, maybe rooted for Light in Death Note, maybe have a dark sense of humor. You might actually dig this. I don't know. If you ask me, Dr. Boll kinda got one here.",1516147200,3,1105,4.364077669902913

6061779,1,B00G6SO7A4,"That this film is badly acted and horribly directed is apparent in the first few minutes.  It takes a few more to realize that it's abysmally written.
Here we have every idiotic bumper sticker of the Progressive Left wrapped in a smug self-righteousness as the main character, a vile and violent character on a murder spree spews an ideology that was responsible for over 100 million deaths in the 20th century.  This rancid ideology that goes under Marxism around the world and has been reborn under the banner of Progressivism in America is fit for infantile adolescents.  That it is taught in college is a tribute to how far our culture, our intellectual heritage has fallen.  This tripe, this 'ideology' is far worse than anything that Nazism could have dreamt of yet it is touted by the likes of Bernie Sanders and the Left in general.  Taught in colleges and mouthed as platitudes by the intellectually weak and vacuous.  Imagine going to Columbia or Harvard or Yale and asking for what courses they have in Nazism.  But this is the reality when asking for its twin sister.  What unites Progressivism, Socialism, Nazism and Communism is the underlying belief in Authoritarian Collectivism.  America was founded on the principle of the individual as the sovereign moral entity.  Collectivism is the antithesis of that and that we find anyone in America financing and writing this kind of garbage film is just disgusting in the extreme.  This is like watching a film that wants to justify pedophilia.  It's not just 'another' POV.  It is a sick and evil ideology and we cannot do enough to call its adherents out for being what they are:  The cesspool of humanity and a stain on human nature.",1515283200,,1696,4.803448275862069

6061795,4,B00G6SO7A4,"A nice story-arc ending to this trilogy. I like how Bill W, the unhinged, unfocused mass killer of the first film, gradually actually becomes more mentally healthy as the films progress, realizing that his targets are not the relatively innocent people around him, but people in power who maintain society's questionable status quo. In this film he takes that logic to its natural and some would say radical or inevitable end. I found the kill-shot of the Prez -- discussed, not shown -- a bit farfetched (I'm no sniper expert, but hitting a highly protected, moving target accurately at 1 mile away seems a bit of a stretch), but otherwise, I like this film and all in the series. The ""Bingo parlor"" scene in the first film (Rampage) is an instant classic, a scene everyone should see, rich with symbolism, a sharp eye for American culture, and dark humor. This third film winds the trilogy down in an exciting, thought-provoking way.",1487635200,,935,4.813664596273292
6061796,1,B00G6SO7A4,"Well... What can I say? I love the first. Uwe Boll made a violent film with a fair point, but he killed the wrong people in it, but hey...IT's a movie, so I forgave it. The second had a triumphant return with a very large point to make and I honestly have to say, I saw it his point and pretty much agreed with the whole thing. Not to mention it was a bigger and better movie on a grander scale and that always hells. The first two films were also smart and executed as such. But this one... Not so much. It's obvious Boll made it, once again in Canada and I'm cool with that, cause Canada is a very nice place. But sadly he had less money to spend on this production than your average birthday gift card from Grandma. It was obviously cheaply made (which normally doesn't bother me) but, he had no imagination to make it LOOK any bigger. I'd have to guess due to all the terrible acting, everything was shot in one take. The Feds were a bunch of unintelligent cry babies without the brain capacity to fill a diaper with instructions and in the end, I could not wait for them to die. Plus the gave away the ending way too soon and since Uwe Boll said this would be his last movie (Yeah, right!) you know what was going to happen, but I didn't expect it to be so lazy with numerous false ending. All though, I have to admit, it was worth listening to about what famous people died and how. Surprisingly, they were all the celebrities I hate, so YAY, Uwe Boll.  I wonder if he made this dirt poor cheap because he couldn't get financing or because he got tired of waiting and wishing for financing. After Part 2, I could wait for a third one. Now I wish I had. If waiting would have meant more money, then it would have been worth the wait. It's always a shame how the ""Part 3"" in a trilogy franchise tend to ruin everything built up till them.  Hard core fans of the first two will not like this. It had a different theme and was more dramatic over the action and violence. The action and violence were ok, but not what we've come to expect.

The first Rampage was decent, this however is just a travesty and appropriately Uwe's swan song (he ranted that he was now going to quit filmmaking since he didn't meet his Kickstarter). Anywho, this ""film"" is a essentially a soapbox (once again) for a German with little to no understanding of US politics--actually, he has no knowledge of  worldly politics for that matter--to provide scene after lazily improvised scene of characters literally watching Youtube videos of current events and talking about them like college SJW kids.

The entire script is pieced together by a highschooler's Facebook feed of popular media opinions with no research done on the part of the filmmakers. Worse, a ton of dialogue is flat out wrong in its statements/politics and only does damage by reinforcing rampant untruths that idiots like Uwe Boll take at face value.

Also, the movie is just lazy and BORING. The entire assassination scene, get this, is just a black screen with gunshot sounds. Uwe was so lazy, he could't even shoot a scene for this. Pathetic.

Imagine that political idiot/SJW that just reads the headers of news stories (takes the Onion as real news )and then screams and yells about how they've done the research on any given political topic--this movie is that person. It's embarrassing and shameful.

Had this been a mindless action flick like the first film, it could have been entertaining, but Uwe needs to shut up and quit being such a hypocrite. He's a complete and total contradiction (he preaches one thing from his interviews/movies like this one and then leads a completely double life, indulging in the very things he states he's an activist against).

Again, you can be a stupid political action movie, but also being TOTALLY BORING, uneventful and supported by some of the worst improvised scenes of ""dialogue"" in film history? I think not.

I saw the listings for the two sequels and thought they were about one man standing up to an increasingly tyrannical US Government, and so got all three for continuity.  What this film depicts is a guy with too much disposable income, serious delusions of adequacy, and a head full of George Soros-inspired nonsense who then goes on a killing spree.  Exactly one of his victims might have deserved some wrath for having failed to get his coffee order right and giving him serious attitude about it.  Everyone else he kills is entirely random, except for killing his best friend at the end to deflect attention from himself.  I love action movies and revenge stories but this movie fails at both.

6061841,4,B00G6SO7A4,"I've watched Rampage on numerous occasions over the years,  while this is not a film I'd recommend to families or even the general population, regardless it remains a clear masterful example of film making on director/writer Uwe Boll's part(Rampage remains his only decent film ever).  While controversial considering the world we live in,  Rampage presents clever social commentary regarding the overall pathetic human condition our complacent and overall irrelevant lives contrasted to the cold,  ruthless and merciless killing machine that is - Bill Williamson(Brendan Fletcher) our KVLT Anti-hero!

I cannot rightly give it 5/5 however 4/5 is as fair as ever with a film regarding such grim and misanthropic subject matter,  added technical constraints due to limited budget i.e. the notorious ""shaky cam"" effect,  while I understand such was intended as a creative device to portray Bill Williamson's deteriorating mental condition it detracts from the quality of the film more so than to it's benefit.

Watch this if you're fed up with the world but not out of ideas or energy just yet! Perhaps you're a Jaded Conservative or just someone planning to drop off the grid till Gtterdmmerung! Just be wary of the other two films considering the primary message of Rampage is effectively direct,  brutal and hard. Whilst the message becomes thoroughly diluted with conflicting ideas presented in the following two films ""Rampage"" despite it's obvious flaws will eternally shine as does Obsidian glass - brittle and imperfect around the edges however sharper in execution and wit than your mass produced action movie.",1476403200,,1617,5.309803921568627

I'm glad I watched it and may again later down the road during a Rampage marathon but it was a huge let down over all.

6061865,3,B00G6SO7A4,"Amazon has lumped the Rampage films together in their review section. This one is specifically for ""Rampage: President Down"".

Uwe Boll continues the series of the life of Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) who drones his ""kill the rich"" monologue to the point of nausea. As you can guess from the title, he kills the President...also VP and Sec. of Defense. We don't see that aspect of the movie which was part of the title. We hear about the ""Trumpian"" style response to the misidentified killer (don't see it either...just a major plot point), see the FBI investigate (in their office) and Bill regurgitate his Marxist revolutionary message from a hole in the ground for nearly an hour before the final confrontation. If you are the type of person who believes the local weather girl is part of a vast media elite conspiracy controlling the masses, then this film is for you.

6061892,1,B00G6SO7A4,"To me, this movie was a barely adequate psycho killer movie. The writer/director/co-producer, Uwe Boll (rarely a good thing when the same person fills those roles), tried for a nihilist/disaffected young man statement, but failed because this was neither a reasonable psychological portrayal of a spree killer nor a sympathy-engendering societal revenge movie.

There is no psychological explanation effort at all. The lead role is simply a loser and a jerk, with no redeeming qualities at all. Mommy and Daddy aren't causative. In fact, they're rather sympathetic and surprisingly normal as they try to engage the 23-year-old willful failure when they try to coach him into responsibility and even offer financial help to move him out of the house (at 23, mind). We didn't see any peer bullying that would have either explained the break-out or shown some humanity, no academic or job unfairness, not even any personal or romantic angst other than the result of his own narcissistic drive. He has no redeeming qualities to elicit sympathy or even empathy, not least because he even has terrible table manners.

There was an attempt at some society-is-broken, population-control motivation, but that cliched mumbo-jumbo, underacted rant at the end seemed tacked on as an afterthought, and was never previously portrayed as a drive. Perhaps there was a cut scene of dialog between the killer and the sheriff, whose role was abruptly and bewilderingly abandoned in the plot after coming within 50' of the killer and surviving an explosion that made him the last law agent standing. (Michael Pare was wasted in this role, and much as I like Michael Pare in a lowbrow way, to say that his modest acting skills were wasted is on the writer/director/producer's head.)

The only positive thing I can say is that the active-shooting scenes were adequately paced and, surprisingly, filmed quite well with a variety of angles that showed but didn't dwell on the gore.",1470355200,,1957,5.109375

Suddenly he gets some boxes in the mail and puts together a suit of impenetrable armor (which, even if it could work, would cost thousands to make) grabs his fully automatic submachine guns (neither of which are anywhere close to being attainable by civilians), then demonstrates his previously hidden talents which include making real vehicles into remote control cars, and wiring up explosives with enough force to decimate a city block. He murders a billion people, but it was all part of a heist scheme? Because society is garbage and money is worthless? But he doesn't believe that? It's just dumb. Drivel.

6061929,1,B00G6SO7A4,"The thin plot of this movie spends a lot of time dropping soundbites of generic marxist tripe that you'd expect to hear from some college-age beta-male who ""passionately"" talks about the alleged problems of overpopulation, narcissism, consumerism and other perceived blights of the modern world. It then introduces a character who espouses the same views, and is portrayed as a friend to the antagonist (the murderer).

Like a typical SJW, this friend will happily issue anonymous death threats to women and children who hurt his sensitive feelings, but he is unlikely to ever follow through. This is something of a ""what if"" type of movie. What if the whiny leftist kiddult got himself some guns and went on a shooting spree ""for the greater good""? And that's pretty much the entire movie.

The first 1/4 shows the antagonist getting prepared, the middle 1/2 is him walking around killing unarmed citizens for absolutely no reason, and the last 1/4 is the big ""surprise"" ending.

There are some gaping errors...such as the fact that he's walking around with a pair of full-auto machine guns and doesn't reload even once. Maybe he used the 'unlimited ammo' code.  Then there was a moment of facepalm logic in a scene where the friend of the antagonist gets all worked up about a fast food fried chicken restaurant somehow representing a downfall of society, as he completely ignores the fact that in a free country people can choose to eat what they like...fast food is one choice, not the only option. Don't like it? Go somewhere else. How is that even a problem?

Anyway, it's a pretty boring movie and I hope my review was equally as boring, so as to prepare you. There is no action because all of the violence is just the kid shooting people who only ever seem to run. Nobody fights back. A few cops try to, but fail. The entire down must have been a gun-free zone...how about that? If there had been some back-and-forth, it could have been slightly better...but not by much.

The ONLY positive I can attribute to this film is that they correctly portrayed the mass-murderer as a leftist who sympathizes with the ideologies of socialism and eugenics - par for the course as documented by history.",1467158400,12,2200,4.761154855643045

6061963,5,B00G6SO7A4,"This film is far more than just one disaffected individual's descent into violent madness and anti-societal behavior. It is a mirror of 21st century America in microcosm and plays out all too real. While at times it does appear to be a bit ""over the top"", it does graphically bring to mind the horror inflicted upon a movie audience watching a late night premier of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES by another calculating, deliberately maliciously willful alienated young man.  Or the sudden slaughter in a shopping mall; or army base; or elementary school; or marathon run. This is a totally unacceptable way of life in what is supposed to be a paragon of civilized society. Philosophical and psychological discussions as to how to staunch this growing problem are so much empty wind.  Perhaps you can treat mental illness if caught in time.  But, the fact that guns and other weaponry are so readily available makes the task of preventing the kind of deranged destruction we see in RAMPAGE almost impossible.  The character played by Brendan Fletcher in an eerily and unfeeling bravura performance seems to have had more fire power than an entire army battalion in WWII.  If the French had had a few thousand like him, they wouldn't have needed a Maginot Line.  The deliberate killing of particular individuals was also nothing more than a pure act of revenge for some imagined or realistic slight that had occurred earlier.  This is ""road rage"" taken to the nth power!  It had nothing to do with the negative attitude against society as a whole.  Nor did the acquisition of a great deal of money conflict with BF's attitude towards the wealthy.  Hypocrisy was no impediment to condemning society and pointing a finger at all its imagined faults.  One would like to know what the director's stance is on the growing violence in our society.  Did we bring this on ourselves?  Do we deserve it?  Can it be stopped?  If so, how do we do it?  These are important questions - and this film forces us to ask them; and to respond accordingly.  In my humble opinion, I believe that every member of Congress and the Supreme Court should be required to see this movie - several times if necessary. And to those who have, I'm glad that you did.",1433289600,,2224,4.705426356589148

The long and short of it is: A known domestic terrorist takes over a TV station so that he can air his political views, and give a live interview to a reporter who once read a statement from Julian Assange on air. Said terrorist allows the reporter to run around unencumbered while holding coworkers hostage. He essentially tortures the hostages and kills some of them, for no apparent reason. His statement is played the interview goes on and he escapes while supposedly freeing hostages, but really blowing up the building and everyone in it.

6061983,4,B00G6SO7A4,"Rampage

Uwe Boll scored with this film. It is a modest and honest account of the impact the societal structure in the United States of America has on the mind of a young average middle class man growing up with rejections in a corporate-governed environment. The explanation by Uwe Boll is rather on the extremist side of sounding simplified. However, Rampage it is, even though it cannot be justified as a reaction. It is one of the realities of life in the world today. When innocents are slaughtered in malls or various other public places, it is considered terrorist activities but the real root of the frame is that it is the society which gives birth to worms called terrorists as they breed in the cess pools of human greed and moulding.
This is a film that came out five years ago and received many positive reviews. It is about Bill Williamson, a twenty-three year old, who is growing up in Tenderville, Oregon. He lives with his parents and works as a mechanic with a meagre income. He is bogged down by several problems and is also influenced by the continuous negative junk that is thrown off by the media and the outspoken views of his friend, Evan Drince.
The film also dwells on the reason why children tend to take the sociopathic route when their parents become detached, greedy and inconsiderate. Bills parents feel that his screws are loose and that he is irresponsible and that he needs to take up family responsibility and get on with his academic life. Even at work, his boss does not think too highly of him and treats him as a scumbag.
Bill decides to act and what he does is a possible reaction that could tempt many frustrated denizens of this imbalanced world. He prints out fake money and then assembles an armor with a steel body that could protect him from bullets. He adds a paintball mask and a ballistic helmet to it. He arms himself with two submachine guns and two semi-automatic pistols and two knives and heads out for the RAMPAGE. The film ends on an interesting note when Bill disappears from the scene leaving a tape to be broadcast on the internet about his intention of `cleansing this world.
The flash and dolly technique used by Uwe Boll is impressive and it is almost as if the film is being shot with a wavy cam. The music is decent with able support by Jessica de Rooij. Brendan Fletcher fits the part of Bill Williamson. Though the second billing of Michael Pare as the Sheriff has very little to do in the film. The parents have done well in Matt Frewer and Lynda Boyd. Shaun Sipos delivers his dialogues well as his friend Evan in the diner. This scene is impressive.
My friend, Antonio DiMichele, feels that Uwe Boll is giving us a warning... and his view of the creation of a terrorist contradicts, disturbingly, the mainstream media profiling of ""terrorists"". The sequel which is out now and titled `Capital Punishment doles out more thoroughly the reasoning and emotion behind Bill's actions. Also, his twisted celebrity makes one wonder about what is on the minds and in the hearts of his fans.
After House of the Dead and BloodRayne, this is quite an impressive film by Uwe Boll.",1415404800,,3136,4.610017889087657

6061985,5,B00G6SO7A4,"Rampage, the ""Killing Spree for Dummies"" video, is a realistic depiction of how any motivated kid with some careful planning and preparation might successfully pull off, and escape from a mass murder killing spree. Some of the techniques and setups shown in this film are fairly accurate as to how a motivated professional would plan, prepare, and execute a full killing spree of mass murder. Throughout the movie, viewers with military and law enforcement training backgrounds will recognize the careful preparation and techniques used, and may comment, ""That's how I would do it if it were me!""

The way it ends, I never expected a sequel to be made, but then Capital Punishment was released. Please, watch the original Rampage a time or two prior to the sequel. You will have a full understanding of the backstory, and this will improve the entertainment value you'll receive watching the sequel. Rampage is only in Blue Ray And Dvd seperately, whereas Capital Punishment offers a Blu Ray DVD combo for the price of the Blue Ray. If they offer it, I recommend a Blu Ray Dvd Combo of both Rampage and Rampage 2 as a set. They are worth owning actual DVDs over online streams or cloud libraries.

6061991,1,B00G6SO7A4,"As many other reviewers have indicated this is a very bad film. And I don't use that term lightly. For me, for a film to be truly bad, it cannot just be plagued with incompetence, it has to have a message that is truly offensive. This qualifies.

The message here (even though it seems to be missed by anybody who liked this movie) it that we are supposed to sympathize and or admire this mass murderer for no other reason then what he is doing is cool and or making a point. And the director very deliberately makes sure that the killer doesn't do anything that would cause even the most jaded audience member to see him as just another idiot psychopath that needs to be killed or put away forever. This means doing everything in his power (even if it means making the movie incredibly unrealistic) to minimize sympathy for the killers victims, maximize our admiration of the supposed cleverness of the killer and trying to show the killer is making some kind of noble statement which should be admired.
Not only is this message laughable and offensive. His attempt to convey this message is unbelievably inept. Here are a few very unrealistic ways he trys:

1) He creates a town composed entirely of successful attractive people in their twenties which are the killers only victims.

I probably don't have to tell you that people seem to feel more sympathy to children, the disabled, the poor and/or people with good hearts then random strangers all dressed in suits who we are never allowed to know anything about other then their only reaction is to run and scream. Somehow this is a town with no old people, no children, nobody has any handicaps, nobody really says anything except the killer, his mother and his best friend. You would probably agree we have less sympathy to complete strangers all dressed the same that we know nothing about then characters we actually get to hear speak, talk and express their humanity. And anybody who is young, vulnerable and/or tries to do something heroic to protect somebody else. If he shot even one person like this, the director's message wouldn't work.

2) He tries to show the killer is intellectually superior by showing that those around him are so stupid that we should not care about them.

Again, reality is departed from amazingly. Even the most idiotic people I've ever met would call the police or express concern if an man dressed in black body armor walked up to them, with a machine gun in each hand, acting aggressive. Yet, we are supposed to believe store clerks, security guards and about 200 seniors playing bingo are completely relaxed while a man like this gets a sandwich and eats lunch when he looks like he's going to do what he is just about to do. Shoot a bunch of people.

3) The kiler is so intellectually superior he can make impenetrable body armor that can withstand any onslaught, even with exposed hands, legs and being shot at at every possible angle by armed police. Oh, and I guess the police are stupid too so they deserve to die also.

The killer made a suit with kevlar and metal plates on his back which makes him look like a turtle. This is somehow the equivalent of a superman suit as he is unscathed throughout the movie no matter how much cops shoot at him.

And the cops here are about as bad as the seniors at the bingo parlor. And again, they are only made up of male, twenty something cookie cutters that seem to have all flunked out of kindergarten since when confronted with a heavily armed suspect they don't bother to return fire once they get shot, don't call for backup, don't get behind something for cover, don't call a swat team, wander off alone to find the killer and somehow can't hit the exposed areas of the suspect even when firing repeatedly with shotguns.

4) The killer is trying to send a message. He burns the banks money instead of taking it. He's trying to say this is all about greed and corruption and money is the real problem.

So logically, the greedy bankers who don't get shot, are the real evil people, so he doesn't shoot them. He burns the money to show them how evil they are, and kills a bunch of people who aren't rich and aren't greedy. Makes sense right. I didn't think so.

5) The killer is so smart. He frames his best friend and never gets caught. We are supposed to think ""Wow, he's a genius"". We'll he's not and here's why.

Since the killer manages to kill 30-40 people before his ""escape"". I would bet that even in this town of incompetent everybody would conduct some form of investigation. This would show the following clues that would immediately lead to the arrest and conviction of the killer guy (I forget his name and I guarantee so will you). The guy he framed is about a foot taller than him, thinner and looks nothing like him. And the killer left his DNA on the sandwich and coke he ate and threw in the garbage while being watched by a security camera, other people while wearing machine guns, I doubt he would be forgotten. He makes no attempt to conceal his face or identify so he could easily be recognized.

In Closing . . .

We've seen good movies with mass murders that were reasonably realistic, at least interesting and with a message not so offensive. Movies like ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Seven"" and ""Scream"" just to name a few. And unfortunately, we've also seen the real life ones like Eric Harris, Dylan Kliebold, Seung Hui-Cho and James Eagan Holmes. The last thing we need is another film that tries to convince us that getting away with murder is not only possible but that people and or the ""world"" deserves it is so offensive I'm not sure what else is.

While it is no ""SEED"" (another Uwe Bolle movie with a hammer scene you will never forget), it uses mostly unknown actors to do the job.  The main actor is believable although the ending made little sense given all the planning you will see.  In the end Rampage delivers exactly what the DVD cover shows.  While not entirely ballistically correct, the director and their consultants did a decent job with making it believable to some degree.  Not for under 17 viewing for sure.

6061998,1,B00G6SO7A4,"Much of the first 40 minutes of the movie consists of flash-forwards.  In fact, one of the first scenes in the movie is one of the last.  Boll appears to be trying to be clever, but the scenes are presented with no context, nothing to connect them to what's going on in the actual scene.  The most obvious of these is Bill, our rampager, shirtless, pouring gasoline into a  barrel, and setting it on fire.  We're supposed to assume that it has some sort of importance given its prominence at the beginning of the film, but in the end it's just a bit of plot.  It has the appearance of significance, but no real symbolic meaning.  In a similar way, interspersed with the flash-forwards are clips of Bill in front of a white background, and while these are explained later in the film, that explanation becomes one of its major problems.

Another ""filmic"" technique that Boll gets wrong is the random clips of news and talk show audio at different points in the film.  The suggestion is that Bill is listening to these while doing something else (such as hitting a punching bag, driving, or getting ready for his rampage).  Just like with the previous clips, you get the idea that Boll is using this for a purpose (in this case he's building up his case for Bill's rampage, a kind of audible explanation), but there are a couple problems with this.  First, the clips are random and general.  At no point does Boll relate these specifically to Bill's character.  Second, they invite the question ""Who's changing the channel?""  If no one's changing the channel, if we accept that this is an artistic technique, then they are there for the audience.  But that takes us back to the first point, and the weakness of the film's support for its theme.

The key to a film like this is the buildup; we have to emotionally connect to both the main character and his situation.  The obvious comparison for this movie is Falling Down starring Michael Douglas, and the parallels are not just in general situation, although that is a good place to start.  The emotional connection fails as soon as characters begin speaking.  The dialog is incredibly stilted and flat; this might be appropriate for our main character, but his parents are the worst offender.  My first thought was that they must be badly improvising, and it appears that is basically what happened; the Netflix description mentions that much of the dialog was improvised.  Thus, an experienced actor like Matt Frewer (Bill's dad; not a phenomenal actor, but by no means bad) comes off looking like he doesn't know where the scene is going.  Bill's mom, played by Lynda Boyd (and actress I'm not familiar with, but who has a large enough filmography to make me think she's normally not horrible) is even worse; she stumbles through lines, each sounding like she's just thought of the words but not how to say them.  Improvisation is about responding and reacting to others, and I never got the feeling that the actors were actually in dialog with each other; instead, as often happens with bad or inexperienced improvisers, they sound like they're talking at each other. The end result of this is that at no point are we emotionally invested in the situation; neither in Bill, nor his parents, nor his friend Evan, no one carries any emotional weight, and thus the events of the film don't really matter.

So, what about his situation?  Surely some string of events, even a string of minor-but-concentrated frustrations that represent the ever-present oppression of modern society, conspire to turn our boy into a mass murderer?  Nope, nothing like that at all.  Basically, our boy is a closet Malthusian (there's too many people in his small, uncrowded town with acres of undeveloped forest teeming with no one but paintball players), his parents are bugging him about going to college or some sort of trade school, and his boss wants him to work for his paycheck.  That's pretty much it.  He has a bit of trouble in a coffee shop (his macchiato wasn't foamy enough)and in a blindingly obvious nod to Falling Down, a fast-food worker inexplicably spills food on him.  Apart from his boxing (which he does in the morning while mom bugs him about breakfast; I mean, how dare she make breakfast for him and expect him to eat it while it's hot?!) we see very little frustration, very little pushing him over the edge.

Movies should raise questions in their viewers minds, but those questions shouldn't undermine the film.  Boll succeeds at the former, but fails at the later.",1374019200,3,4523,4.729591836734694

6062000,4,B00G6SO7A4,"This is the second film by Uwe Boll I have seen, the other being Stoic, the very dark and unsettling prison film where cellmates systematically torture and murder one of their own. That film was a very unforgiving and very depressing story with hardly a happy ending. In this film the same holds true. A demented young man masterminds a scheme to go on a killing rampage murdering most of the people who live in his town. Indeed he kills about 75 percent of the people he comes across in a horrifying 40 minute killing spree. He feels justified by what he does. He feels no remorse what so ever. And worst of all he gets away with it. The sheer unthinkable horror that takes place in this film seems like some awful dream that could never happen in real life, but it already has, many times. People have already done things this brutal. Mindless, sickening rampages that boggle the imagination. This film is totally heartless and horrific in its story about a truly disturbed individual doing something that is so vile and ugly it makes you wonder what is wrong with the human race. Boll has been called the Ed Wood of modern day films having created apparently some very bad movies. Well I haven't seen any of his other films, but Stoic and this movie are both very good films. Some people felt the actress who played the main characters mother was a bad actress. I don't agree. She seemed naturalistic to me, meaning very real to life. An average person. She seemed human, normal, therefor her acting was good in my opinion. This is an ugly film to watch but its very well done and very sobering in its content.

Content wise it's nothing less than a propaganda film for the anti-gunners. The plot summary talks about semiautomatics but the main character uses fully auto machine guns throughout. He seldom reloads even though it shows magazine capacities that wouldn't last beyond 10 seconds of burst fire. He shoots effectively and accurately at distance from the hip without aiming. He apparently has easy access to fully automatic weapons that have been federally restricted since the 1930s and completely banned to citizens (import and manufacture) since the mid-1980s (the cops and politicians' security can get them).

The only accurate bit of the whole movie is that the completely unarmed population is left to cower impotently as he casually does as he wants.

Point by plot point is plays to every misinformative playbook out there to sew fear into viewers who don't know any better but will certain take it as ""reality"" (that whole shaky camera thing) and e-mail their political representatives, wring their hands to their friends, and write to comment columns pleading to be repressed by yet more anti-gun laws.

6062009,5,B00G6SO7A4,"Rampage has the look and feel of something that could and does happen.  After the events in Norway and now Colorado this film is even more haunting.  What pushes someone over the edge?  Daily occurrences may seem like small meaningless little annoyances to one person can have a huge or unforeseen impact on other people.  The movie tries to show that the world is full of people who rule their tiny little petty kingdom like a tyrant, lording their scrap of authority over others in a blistering fashion or people who vent their spleen on others on a whim and they do so thinking laws and a civil society will protect them and allow them to continue their behavior with little or no repercussions.  The film capitalizes on a recent trend that seems to be showing that this isn't always the case, and this film looks at what happens when someone with a disturbed mind goes outside the lines of a civilized society and it's guidelines to right perceived wrongs against them. What happens in a twisted mind we never knew existed but may have been living with or next to and not even known it?  What makes someone ""snap""?  This film delves into a mind that goes outside the lines and is presented in way that is all too real and in a contemporary manner in the age of video and written manifestos from disturbed minds.  The constant flash forward to the video statements just kept hitting home the point that this is all too real.  This isn't entertainment, this is a kick in the gut and a warning on how our society is changing and not for the better..

6062011,2,B00G6SO7A4,"I don't know who Uwe Boll is and I don't care.  I'm not a fan of movies that start out by heading in one direction only to halt in the middle of something and then backtracking with a new account: 2 days earlier.  This is especially irksome when the direction Boll was initially heading was too brief to establish anything but a few scattered images and an explosion; he might just as well have started the movie two days earlier!  Not that it would have made any difference as the timeline in this piece was suspect throughout.  Images were oft repeated, news reports kept chattering in the background announcing events that hadn't happened yet, were happening, or had just happened.  At any given moment, it was never certain what was taking place, was it real, was it about to happen, had it happened already, or were these just the conflicting images and random thoughts of a lunatic, or a very savvy bank robber?  I don't mind a little ambiguity now and then but not throughout an entire movie.  It's as if a hyperactive kid filmed then edited this piece as a class project.  At the close of it I wasn't quite certain what the point was; it isn't cynical enough to be political, it doesn't have the style necessary to make it an art film, the action isn't organized enough to make it a thriller.  What then?  Even the title is misleading, for although the lead character does go on a rampage, he never displays the required rage to make it feel justified (if only in his own mind).  The few circumstances that were brought up as evidence only suggested that he was having a really bad day.  Were all his days like this?
As a whole, I found this movie curiously flat, displaying little emotion in thought or deed.  The biggest problem with this premise is that it demonstrated little we don't already know, while giving us characters so unrealized that we can't care about them or what happens to them.

6062017,4,B00G6SO7A4,"I sit here in shock, trying to come to terms with the fact that I've discovered a Uwe Boll film that is actually watchable - even, gulp, pretty good.  I know, I know.  I can't believe I'm saying it, either.  What is the world coming to when I could actually enjoy a movie written, directed, and produced by Uwe Boll?  Make no mistake, though - this guy is still the worst filmmaker alive today.  I guess even a three-legged albino, mange-ridden mutt can get lucky once in his life.  This is still the German director who dares his most vocal critics to duke it out with him inside a boxing ring, the same man who gave the world such films as House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark.  In case you're wondering, Rampage is not just some clone of Falling Down.  What distinguishes Rampage is its implicit amorality.

Bill Williamson is a 23-year-old loser apparently determined to mooch off of his parents for as long as possible.  His parents are actually encouraging him to leave and start a life of his own, while his only friend is one of those annoying liberals constantly spouting off about how awful the world is.  Whereas his buddy is all talk and no action, Bill is the opposite.  Haunted by a stream of constantly rotating bad news headlines and an inability to get a properly-made cup of coffee, Bill decides the overpopulated world could use a lot less people.  Thus comes the rampage, wherein Bill dons his very own Kevlar combat suit, loads up with automatic weapons and explosives, and sets out to kill as many people as possible, completely taking the ""Tender"" out of his home town of Tenderville.  Naturally, I expected a boring and mundane ending that would leave young Bill lying in a pool of his own blood.  That's not how the story ends at all. Boll actually takes the viewer down an unexpected path that actually makes the story memorable and causes the viewer to reevaluate the main character to some degree.  It doesn't make Bill any less of a psychopath, but it certainly distinguishes him from your average mass murderer.  This guy actually has some wheels still turning inside his head, and his plan definitely does not include suicide by cop.

Bill's motivations are open to question.  He doesn't really seem to care about all of the bad news constantly bombarding his brain, nor does he seem to truly buy in to his friend's constant social commentary on the dire consequences of overpopulation.  Apart from a verbal conflict over a cup of coffee, there's no event that really triggers his behavior, either.  He doesn't hate his parents, who are very supportive even in their wish that he move out and begin to live his own life.  Apparently, his rampage is just something that has been building up inside him for a long time.  He may see himself as an agent of cleansing in the world, but he murders indiscriminately and without judgment.  Perhaps the fact that Bill has no clearly discernible motives for his actions is supposed to represent the utter depravity of society or something.  Then there's the bingo scene, easily the most memorable and surreal in the film, in which the clearly armed and dangerous killer walks throughout the building for several minutes without anyone even noticing him.  Boll obviously means this to be some form of social commentary of a world increasingly losing its humanity and peopled by men and women who turn a blind eye to even the most obvious sources of evil out there.  I guess Boll should know something about the subject, having personally made the world a darker and more depressing place with all of his previous movies.",1320451200,4,3593,4.679936305732484
6062018,5,B00G6SO7A4,Rampage is most likely one of the most cold-blooded violent films ever made. The perpetrator of all the mayhem makes suicide bombers look like amateurs but he has a totally different agenda with actions that no one can see coming.

The production is directed and acted in a very straightforward style and we never really know what the main character is thinking until the very end.

6062019,4,B00G6SO7A4,"Written and directed by Uwe Boll, Rampage (2009) is a brutally raw, ultra-violent, and relentlessly shocking tale, that while not without flaws, holds together surprisingly well.  Boll, no stranger to controversy, centers his film on Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) a young man living in Oregon, who born out of frustration, seems bent on carrying out a senseless act of mass violence, but as events unfold, unlike many who go on a killing spree, Williamson has no thoughts of self-destruction.  Some spoilers follow so proceed at your own risk.

Bill Williamson is 23 and lives at home, but is being pressured by his father (Max Frewer) and mother (Lynda Boyd), to move out.  Bill works at an auto repair shop, where he is not exactly the boss's favorite employee.  After work, Bill meets his friend Evan Drince (Shaun Sipos) at the Chicken Den restaurant.  Evan has a couple of packages for Bill, as apparently for some time, Bill has been having items he ordered delivered to Evan's address.  Grabbing a bite to eat, the guys arrange to meet in the woods the following day, for a paintball fight.

Back at home, Bill surprises his parents with the announcement that he plans to return to college.  After his excited parents toddle off to work, Bill puts on body armor and a helmet, and armed with automatic weapons, drives into town.  Williamson has previously loaded a van with explosives, and rigged it to operate via remote control.  Using a radio control unit, he crashes the van into the police station, and sets off an explosion that disrupts law enforcement's ability to react.

A large section of the film follows Williamson as he wanders through the town, shooting whoever happens to catch his eye.  Dozens of people are mowed down, as the streets soon become littered with bodies.  Children might be spared, but Boll has few reservations about who the violence touches.  At one point Williamson encounters a terrified woman cowering in fear.  Williamson calmly reloads, and then cheerfully shoots her dead.  Surprisingly, Williamson's boss escapes death, but Bill makes a special effort to kill several others who ticked him off earlier.

A beauty shop is among Williamson's most notable stops, where after pausing for a drink he leaves behind a pile of bloody bodies.  The film's most surreal scene takes place in a bingo hall, where mostly elderly people are so fixated on the game, that they don't seem to notice that a man with a gun has entered the premises.  Williamson doesn't kill anyone, apparently because in his mind, the people already seemed to be dead.  Clearly another important statement by director Bol.

Bill makes his way back to his car, and drives over to the bank to make a withdrawal.  After gunning down some hero types who try to jump him, Williamson gets the cash and heads out of town to keep his appointment with Evan.  On his way to the woods, the well-prepared Williamson takes out some sheriffs who get on this tail, setting the stage for Boll's bold and controversial finish.

The deleted scenes indicate that Bol streamlined his story to focus more on the acts of violence, rather than on the details of Williamson's plan.  That such outrageous and wanton violence goes unpunished, is unexpected, and is the kind of statement that few filmmakers are willing to make.  While the violence in Rampage may be reprehensible and excessive, Williamson doesn't come across as a pretentious ridiculously clichd character.  Ruthlessly executing a diabolical plan, the horrific violence has a realistic and chilling edge.  Brendan Fletcher delivers a powerful performance and the acting in general is strong and quite credible.

Uwe Boll's commentaries are not to be missed.  They are typically very candid and revealing, and he also takes great joy in patting himself on the back.  The director often seems unaware, or perhaps doesn't care, that he is often his own worst enemy.  Constantly criticized, Boll has a chip on his shoulder, as he rails against what he perceives are injustices, and condemns those he disagrees with.

You may not always appreciate Boll's point of view, and he's clearly not the most magnanimous guy, but dismissing his films as total garbage might be a mistake.  Rampage is not without flaws, and the shaky camera work is irritating, but Boll pulls all the pieces together well, to tell a harsh and twisted tale in a stylish, clever, and uncompromising way.",1315440000,,4857,5.286831812255541
6062020,4,B00G6SO7A4,"I came to Rampage not knowing that it was written, directed, and produced by Uwe Boll. The poster, which shows an armed and armored man, reminded me a lot of the opening scene of Lethal Weapon 4. But you don't need to look far for Rampage's inspiration. It's not that Rampage could happen.  It DID happen: The North Hollywood shootout in 1997 was an armed confrontation between two heavily armed bank robbers and officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in the North Hollywood district of Los Angeles.

Rampage is as much a castigation of gun culture as it is a fetishization of the perfect crime. Following in the footsteps of the perfect heist (Ocean's 11) and the perfect serial killer (American Psycho) Boll gives us the perfect spree killer. In the wake of the 2011 Norway attacks and Columbine, the horror of spree killings are still raw.  Why did they happen?  Rampage has answers.

But there is no one simple answer. Intercuts of Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) staring enigmatically at the camera while his supposed best friend Evan Drince (Shaun Sipos) rages against the world provide the veneer of sanity.  A disaffected youth about to be pushed out of his parent's home, Williamson has been working on his unholy vengeance for some time.  He imported weapons and improvised explosives, modified vehicles and crafted body armor, all with the intent of killing everyone in his path.  Whatever snapped in Williamson, it broke a long time ago.

Williamson's rampage is at turns terrifying in its brilliance and callow in its callousness. He is a frustrated young man desperate for a connection with women when he takes an entire salon hostage; he is a petty bully getting revenge at the local coffee shop; he is a scheming terrorist who outwits an entire police department.  Williamson is every boogeyman rolled into one, waging a one man war on the world.

Rampage has a short running time and it could be even shorter - the lead-up sequences are padded with scenes of the murder to come.  If it has a flaw, it's Boll's insistence on haunting every frame with screams and dire media reports. It's unnecessary. The horror of Williamson's attack on Tenderville, OR is at its most gripping when he stares straight at the screen, dead eyes boring into your soul.

Rampage isn't perfect.  The improvised scenes drag, the film occasionally veers into the surreal, and the visual style grates after awhile. But for Boll, it's a huge improvement.",1313971200,3,2462,4.872901678657074
6062021,4,B00G6SO7A4,"Aahhhh...Uwe Boll, the man who seems to be single-handedly attempting to destroy Kristanna Loken's career (see: BloodRayne & Name of the King).  Yes, this is the same Uwe Boll - as if someone else would name their kid that after the atrocious legacy this one has left - that caused more than one person to throw up while watching House of the Dead.  Not because it was gross, but because it was nauseatingly bad.  The same guy who inexplicably is permitted to direct films and walk the streets of Hollywood, much less use his voodoo to get stars to act in his films.  Well, Boll got one right for a change.

In a possible homage to the popularity of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, and possibly to society's desensitization to violence, Rampage delivers a gut punch of nearly unexplainable carnage.  After mail ordering all the Kevlar body armor a guy could use, getting angered by the lack of civility among the general populace, and listening to the constant drone of his pseudo-intellectual, save-the-world, all talk acquaintance, Bill (Brendan Fletcher) decides to get off his parents' couch and do something about what's been irking him.  Ignore the tedious start and the poorly executed jump cuts; this is Michael Douglas from Falling Down if that character actually formed a plan instead of snapping during traffic.

Once the action of a killing spree starts, the movie goes full throttle.  Octogenarian bingo games notwithstanding (a hilarious pace changer) the entire back half of this movie is a nihilist's wet dream.  Sadistic undertones and a hint of story are more than enough fuel to last until the credits roll.  While the character development is lacking, and there isn't profound depth in the script, the massacre, because it reverberates in our memories of Columbine and Virginia Tech, feels all too realistic.  Which makes this movie not only powerful, but gripping.  Ironic because most people want to imitate the movie Rampage after watching most of Uwe Boll's other films.",1306972800,3,1994,4.969879518072289
6062022,5,B00G6SO7A4,"This is a unique movie. There's a lot of senseless violence, but it makes you think about some of the social issues that Uwe Boll presents. Sure, the murders are brutal, and in many cases, would be uncalled for in any other movie. But, the thing that saves this movie from being thrown away is that whether you like it or not, it'll stick with you for a while. Don't watch this if you want a Transformers -esque action movie. You will be sorely disappointed, and will most likely hate it. If, however, you like movies that make you think for days after you saw it, you'll most likely enjoy this. This was one of the better movies I saw in 2010, not because of the action, story, or acting, but because it rose above the mindless garbage that's usually floating around. I strongly recommend it.",1304726400,,793,4.438356164383562

As others have said, for Uwe Boll, this is a masterpiece. Its violent, but it also doesnt condone the violence that is being done. Its actually a lot deeper than what many people would give it credit for. Lets be honest, haven't we all had such a crappy day that weve imagined what it would be like to go on a rampage on society? The story is pretty good, the acting isn't bad and the effects are awesome. I hope that Uwe Boll continues to make movies of this nature.",1303344000,,682,4.051851851851852
6062024,4,B00G6SO7A4,I was not expecting a ton of action in a low budget film. This film is surprisingly good and I can't believe I had never heard of this film. Blockbuster video was closing down and I bought this film for $3 dollars. Well worth my $3 dollars. I understand why this film didn't make main stream theaters with all the senseless killings. I know this could be a dangerous film in the wrong hands. This film shows a fed-up individual who goes on a killing spree because he's tired of all the stress from life. The explosions and shootings look real and the tension can be felt. With the current shooting in Arizona this movie must be hard to swallow in Arizona. I believe this is the new type of horror that feels life like. Everyday people shopping and doing there errands are being shot down like animals is a trully terrifying scenario. If you want to see a modern day horror story look to this film. It will scare you to realize how easy it is for someone to flip out on society. I just hope people understand the message and don't take this movie as an invitation into doing something stupid.,1301875200,,1091,4.379310344827586
6062025,4,B00G6SO7A4,"This movie was recommended by my Netflix account, which leads me to wonder if I should reconsider my genre interests.  All humor aside, I felt that this film was pretty well done.  It is a dark film and I can understand why some folks might not enjoy it because of the subject material, but from a film standpoint I think it was done nicely.

I had some doubts if this was even worth my time, especially given that I really don't like anything by its director.  Basically, it's about an unhappy twenty-something that is living at home with parents who are awkwardly coaxing him out of the house.  Clearly upset with his parents as well as the world in general, he is planning a grand-scale massacre to get a point across.  However, as events transpire, we quickly learn that his actual intentions are not what he's proclaiming.  Overall, the story hooked me to the end and I felt the acting was good.  Brendan Fletcher fits the role of the disturbed individual well, particularly with his facial expressions and eyes that are haunting to say the least.

As a disclaimer, I will emphasize that a lot of people are senselessly killed.  At some points, I couldn't help but feel sorry that they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  However, I didn't feel this film glorified their deaths like some people might suggest.  Similarly, I didn't feel their deaths were particularly gory either.  Granted, there is some blood, but nowhere near the kind of stuff you would see in ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"".  I'm struck by the fact that a good number of people gave negative reviews because of this, yet are probably the type to watch ""CSI"" or ""Criminal Minds"" where some poor sap gets murdered every week.  Maybe it's a difference in opinion, but I personally felt this film didn't go too far over the line.

In summary, I give it four stars for a good story and the lack of glorification.  I would best describe it as a short film about a disturbed person who gets out of line.  Probably not a film to save for date night or to watch with your Grandma after Christmas dinner, but worth a chance if you prefer darker films and can accept the subject material.",1301702400,,2157,4.529715762273902
6062026,5,B00G6SO7A4,"Every once in awhile a film comes out of nowhere and seems to blister the screen.  Rampage is a simple story that engages the viewer with a harsh acuity that is impossible to disregard.  If you're addicted to danger, this is awesomely brutal and all too real.  It's not based on a video game, Director Uwe Boll gets serious here and takes absolutely no prisoners.

It's the story of a young man named Bill.  He's a bit of a slacker, floating around through life with little direction or motivation.  His parents are getting leery of his lackluster drive, putting pressure on their son to grow up and start showing some initiative.  One day, Bill finally reaches his breaking point.
After being dissatisfied with the service from a coffee shop employee, Bill is bound and determined to get revenge.  Not only on the worker, but the entire town.  With a couple of machine guns and a full body suit of Kevlar armor, he goes on a killing rampage.  It's a harrowing display of controlled but psychotic madness.  Pretty difficult not to get immediate flashbacks of Columbine or Virginia Tech.

Reasons?  The violence seems pretty senseless.  Frustration, indifference, mental instability?  Or maybe like the P.O.D. song, maybe Bill just needed to be hugged.  He seems to be a bit introverted, without too many friends.  He resembles countless other young people in society today.  Could be your son, your neighbor, your classmate.  That makes this all the more frightening.  He brashly claim to be on some sort of mission because much of the world's problems come from overpopulation.  Not to mention the ineptitude of the mass majority (this coming from a total deadbeat).  Anyway, time for him to start cleaning house, and it's survival of the fittest.

Final grade = A.  Much like the hapless victims, I was blown away.  Rampage is a total shocker, plus a brash profound statement.  Oh, the acting here is flawless as well.  These awful events seem all too real.  It might be classified as an action movie, but it also qualifies as psychological horror.  Completely gripping and unflinching.  Must see stuff.",1300233600,14,2105,4.864406779661017
6062027,4,B00G6SO7A4,"My dad kept telling me how good this movie was, so I decided to watch it today. I thought it was pretty darn good and had interesting thoughts behind the action. It wasn't mainly about someone who went psycho and went killing a bunch of people. The character actually had a pretty good concept behind the killings. Many do in movies, but this one was actually more believable than I expected. When my dad told me about this movie he said ""It is about this guy who creates his own bullet proof outfit and just goes around seeing how many people he can kill.""That was a basic description of it, but if he would have explained further about the motive behind the character doing that, I would have watched it sooner. Usually the movies he says are good normally are, and he was right about this one. I think it could have had a better build up on the story behind his concept of killing these people before he did so, but then again it was explained fully at the end. I think I liked the ending most of all. I really was not expecting what happened. I would explain how great the ending was, but then I would be spoiling the movie.

6062029,5,B00G6SO7A4,"Rampage is full of rage. A riveting look at the dark side of America and the anger felt by many disillusioned men and women. A psychological look at a man gone mad. The insanity of one man on a killing spree through a small suburban town in america. He burns the money which says everything about his state of mind. He had no intentions on profitting from his rampage through his little town. He killed without mercy. He stops to do bingo in the middle of his killing spree. This says so much about his mind. He wasn't doing this for pleasure he was doing this for some twisted reason that not only he could tell. I think if he was doing it for the pleasen then he would have killed everybody playing bingo, but he didn't kill anyone there. He even tried to help them play bingo. Was all of this just a game to him? He understood the bingo players. They weren't a threat to him. I think the bingo scene alone says so much about his state of mind. Great film! Kudos!!",1292716800,,966,4.227027027027027
6062030,1,B00G6SO7A4,"I saw that this had low reviews on Netflix, so I decided to watch it with the intention of sort of mocking its badness.  It is, however, a surprisingly well crafted film, with stylistic camera work and fairly good dialog.

Ideologically speaking, though, it's a sick, stupid mess.  The actions of the anti-hero are inconsistent with someone trying to destroy society, and his motivations are juvenile at best(""not enough natural resources to support the population"") , and just painfully stupid at worst (""fast food is killing us"").

But here's the main problem.  As misguided and naive as the main character evidently is, the film doesn't acknowledge that he's misguided and naive.  Rather, it makes him into some sort of political revolutionary.  His half-baked ideas are never fully explained or challenged.  The film wants it both ways: it wants to show the shooter as a psychopath while at the same time trying to make him into some sort of anti-modernism action hero.  The murder scenes are brutal, but there in no meaning in them.

I like violent movies.  I love Vahalla Rising, I love A History of Violence, and I love HBO's Deadwood and Rome.  But these films have some grain of humanity involved in their violence, some sort of moral consistency to life and death decisions.  They are morally complex films which use violence to make some statement about life's struggles.  The only statement Rampage makes is that some filmmakers are emotionally immature.

The film is much like what a video diary of the Columbine shooters may have looked like.  It seeks to portray a person filled with naive rage at society, but the film refuses to take  responsibility for the consequences.  The main character never actually becomes a ""bad guy.""  Even as he's doing incredibly disgusting things for no reason, the film portrays him as an action hero.  The viewer is asked to go along for the ride, to sympathize with the crazy psychopath.  It's like being asked to sympathize with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold as they were gunning down their fellow classmates.  (""You poor thing: society has been hard on you.  No wonder you felt like you had to murder random people.  It's okay.  Society had it coming!"")

In the end the psychopath who kills people is passed off as some sort of hip urban legend. This, I imagine, is how Harris and Klebold thought they would be remembered.  The difference though is that the Columbine shooters realized the horror of their actions.  Unable to face the reality of what they had done, they committed suicide.  Not our hero in this movie.  For someone obsessed with making a political statement via murder, he is very concerned that he not get caught.  And he doesn't.  He gets away with gunning down about 200 random people.  He shoots his best friend in the head and then frames him for the shooting spree.  The film maker awards the film's protagonist with a semi-legendary status.  Psycho shooter boy looks in the camera and says something like ""I'm still out there.  Maybe I'll come for you.""  God!  This movie is so stupid!  It's such infantile crap!  It's stunning to me that this film apparently has a willing audience.

You will want to vomit after seeing this film.  I'm no puritan, but I cannot think of a more disgusting, nihilistic, and above all STUPID hour and a half of video.  May the person who created this movie never work again.",1292457600,8,3381,4.786828422876949

6062033,3,B00G6SO7A4,"Rampage is a film about a 23 year old kid who decides one day he is gonna go on a rampage and shoot up a town and see if he can get away with it. The beginning is fairly slow, some actors do a decent job, while others, like the parents, act in ways that just where not convincing. What makes little sense is WHY this guy goes on a rampage, he hardly seems to fit the type that would do such a thing when you get the back story of how it leads up to the rampage event. You have to laugh that this movie did everything it possibly could to avoid showing or mentioning any video games, else the censors would have had a field day with this movie, and no, i'm not saying video games cause violence, i'm just saying it would have made a little more sense if that was his inspiration rather then ""paint ball"" games.

In the end it tried to be a clever little thing where all the lose ends where tied up, however, I got them all, and I think everyone got it too, so the need for a montage to recap the previous events where pretty much pointless and I think they where going for something a lot smarter then they ended up with. Oh, and the done-to-death thing that everyone is sick and tired of, they try to claim this actually happened.... yeah, remember on the news a few years ago you heard about a guy going postal on a whole town? Remember that story? No???? I wonder why... cause it never happened, just like Blair Witch, Haunting In America & Paranormal Activity NEVER really happened and you would have to be pretty gullible to believe they did. So this just makes your eyes roll when you see them try to claim this happened, thinking their audiences are as stupid as they are for trying to pull such b.s.

Overall, its decent, and watchable, but not the sort of movie that will become a favorite or something you would buy for yourself after you have seen it. Worthy of a rental or D/L, but not worthy of keeping in the collection to pull out again anytime soon.",1287273600,,1964,4.206896551724138

The acting is horrible... the plot thin.. but it will be praised by all those who like seeing innocent people pleading for their lives, and shot in gory detail by a punk covered in armor, playing God with automatic weapons. Women, men, children, all unarmed, and all killed in cold blood as they try running and hiding... with the character making a clean break. The film maker tries to suggest to the audience through a closing historical note, that the character had some reason (population control), and that he is still at large.. insinuating that he was real (an excuse for having taken this sewage to film). But it's not, it's all fake, it never happened. Not to say this won't be food for thought for many a psychotic killer, as it doubtless will; you can blame Uwe Bol, for having made our world a less-safe place to live by bringing us this film.

The scene in the hair salon when he gathers the women up, helpless and unarmed, shaking and pleading for their lives, then shoots them all crowded at the end of the hallway, bodies piling up as the bullets riddle their bodies, should get this film an X rating for violence. It's unconscionable that this garbage didn't get an X rating; this movie is the worst kind of pornography, and a sign of sickness that people watched this and were not revolted by it.",1287100800,5,1423,4.536964980544747

6062036,1,B00G6SO7A4,"It took me a while to understand my feelings about this film. After some reflection, I think this worthless filth has changed me, but not in the ways the director might've intended.

I'm no prude. I've watched many, many violent films in my day. HELLRAISER, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, HARRY BROWN...the list is pretty much endless. I've enjoyed them, and  been shocked but never overly offended by violence, murder, gore. I don't know quite how to articulate it, but many of these films had other qualities that made them worthwhile: the pitch-black humor of CLOCKWORK, the sympathetic protagonist in HARRY BROWN, the elegant storytelling of HELLRAISER, etc.

That being said, RAMPAGE offended me, made me sick to my stomach and in my spirit, and defined for me what the glorification of violence is really about.

 As other reviewers have said, the plot is a wisp of a thing: spoiled self-involved suburban twentysomething constructs body armor, arms himself with machine guns, knives, and bombs, and goes through his town killing everyone he sees without rhyme or reason. And he gets away with it by framing his best friend.

And that's it.

The motives for his actions are never fully revealed. There's some noise made about world overcrowding and how he believes he's doing some kind of service by reducing the population. Wow, what a guy! Thanks, buddy! The character himself is a hollow shell, a cipher, an automaton on which to drape high-powered weaponry. I had no feelings for him other than sadness and disgust.

As I mentioned, I never fully understood the term 'glorified violence'. But when his little rampage begins, the relish with which it's presented brings the phrase fully alive. The character's first victim is a random truck driver, which he shoots through the windshield. Next are random people walking down the street. Then he must stop because he's out of ammo, and stops to have a chat with a horrified girl who he kills when he's reloaded. Then off to a beauty salon, where he rounds up the women like cattle, has a drink and complains about how hot is suit is, and executes them in a corner of the shop.

And on and on and on and on. All presented in loving detail.

I think Boll might have been trying to comment on the state of the world; he might have been going for a Big Statement Film that sums up the violent zeitgeist of modern America. Instead, what he's done is add a little more evil into an already depraved society. I never thought I'd say these things about a film--I'm pro-artistic freedom, anti-censorship, pro-artist, etc. I think I just had to be exposed to the face of true artistic worthlessness and--yes, I'll say it--EVIL to have my views shaken up.

I could go on for pages, and probably will in arenas outside of an Amazon review. For now, I think my title sums it up: this film is anti-life, anti-hope, anti-art, anti-sense, anti-everything.

I myself tried to avoid this film due to the history of this horrible director and his D-grade movies he puts out. This movie doesn't deserved to be as overlooked as it has. Rampage is a brilliant...brilliant...brilliant movie. I wouldn't recommend this at all to the sensitive. The movie is basically about a killer that goes on a rampage. There is no sense of justice, and there is no rational point (aside from his ramblings about cleansing society). What you basically watch is a disturbed person that finally cracks and breaks.

Like most lunatics they think what they are doing is right and they believe it to the core. It's the exact feeling you get when you watch rampage. A 23 year old failure living at home with his parents (who is a leech of society himself) who hasn't figured out yet how to survive in the real world on his own. His answer to growing up and moving out is to create an idea in his head that all these working people are wrong and their way of life isn't idealistic how people should live. Everything people work for in life is a lie.

Some how Bill(the main character) thinks that he can help improve the world by killing random people and calling it ""population control"". So that the rest of society can live freely of all the leeches not providing for the rest of the world. It's a crazy idea and makes about as much sense as every other lunatic that kills innocent people. A corrupt idea to support an unjust action. So at the cost of Bill's warped psychology 93 innocent people lose their lives.

There's no hero in this film and no one to cheer for. It's more like watching a bad accident. It's terrible but somehow you can't take your eyes off of what's going on. To sum it up this movie is nothing more than watching a lunatic going on a killing spree. That be just about your typical gun man today...but this one has a movie that you can watch.

If you've seen a Uwe Boll film before believe me this is nothing like any of them! I honestly don't believe Uwe Boll had as much input in this film as he usually does. I get the feeling there was a lot of ghost directing done in this film. I know Uwe bolls style and this isn't at all it.

Great Movie for the mature minded! This is a film for adults though not for kids or teens.",1281916800,3,2370,4.314606741573034
6062038,4,B00G6SO7A4,"Uwe Boll is notorious of one of the worst directors of all time, and many people buy his movies only to riff on them, and laugh at his insane ramblings on the director's commentary (if you've never heard one, I strongly recommend it). With 'Rampage', he has shocked me by making a very enjoyable movie, with very good acting, and a story that, while very confused, actually tells a story that is very entertaining. Boll once again filmed all dialogue as improvisation, but unlike 'Stoic' and 'Darfur', here he has a team of actors that can carry the story, with very natural sounding conversations. It's also nowhere near as exploitative as his other films, with the titular rampage lasting only about forty minutes. While that may sound like a very long time, by Boll's standards, that's almost subdued. I highly recommend this to Boll fans as a pleasant surprise, and to fans of psychological study films.",1281312000,,907,4.82051282051282
6062039,1,B00G6SO7A4,"I can sum the plot of this movie up in one sentence: Man goes out and kills senselessly and gets away with it. I've never seen a movie that glorifies killing like this one does. It's disturbing. How long will it take for the next generation of psycho shooters to idolize this movie like the Columbine killers idolized Natural Born Killers? Besides the tasteless plot of this movie, it's aggravating to watch because it looks like the cameraman is either drunk or he's trying to balance himself on a small raft while standing and trying to film. I think that the producers/actors should have thought twice about making and being in this movie...",1279411200,7,644,4.707964601769912
6062040,5,B00G6SO7A4,"The only thing bad about this movie is the subtitle on the bill/poster; ""Violence is Brutal""?!?!  Lame!!  I wonder how the director could have allowed that piece of doo doo to appear on his movie ad.  (Notice the person is not wearing gloves in the poster; another goof.)

Kidding aside, and morality aside, this movie was simply awesome.  It was like riding in a car with no brakes.  I kept wondering when it was going to stop; but it just kept going and going.  Finally came the ending, which was stupendously rewarding.

Simply put, if you can't stand violence, don't watch this film.  If you can see past the violence and enjoy the art of filmmaking, this movie is for you.

I love the first breakfast table scene (spilled juice), the bingo parlor scene, and the Chicken Den scene.  I know of many clueless parents similar to the ones in this movie.  I know of many jerk women (have to watch my language here) like the ones in the hair salon.  And the scariest of them all, I know of many smart and dangerous people like this guy.",1277251200,6,1034,4.4361702127659575
6062041,4,B00G6SO7A4,"Wow I did not expect that. It is delightfully politically incorrect. The movie is completely unapologetic with the excessive violence and is extremely judgmental. Are the views of this movie correct? Probably not, but it is good to see someone just run with it.

8621142,2,B00G6SO7A4,"Ok, let me start off by saying as a fan of classic 90s counter culture cult films such as The Matrix or Fight Club and later anti hero type movies such as V for Vendetta or Riddick series. They were all stellar compared to this Rampage GARBAGE. Only reason I give it not 1 star but 2 was due to the pretty good acting and yes most of what he states is correct, and no this isn't another hate america film for the conservative crowd to point the finger at, nor is it a liberal lovers film and even less a radical commie or anarchist film, which by the way I couldn't help but laugh at the end when the news reporters utter the words ""right wing anarchists"".... When anarchism is an extreme left ideology which in no way resembles anything right wing.

Now that we got that out of the way, I never heard of these films till I saw the 2nd one in the TV station, now I saw the 3rd as it progressed to vile putrifact idiocy, hey If I want some violence maybe Ill watch a Tarantino flick, but this? Give me a break. As stated the acting, good, the protagonists ideals are noble. BUT GET REAL. One man cant change the world and even less killing innocent people which may I add plenty were just ordinary working class citizens. No this does not wake anyone up.

If anything its the concocted pipe dream of a screenwriters mind to make the same money he talks about, and even in the film the TV producers in prequel are making millions in ""2 hours"". So what did the protagonist change? Besides the fact he seems in desperate need of a MMJ card? And the rest of plot holes? Ohh yeah hes a leet hacker that can hack right in and eavesdrop on feds. Wait he got a remote control machine gun and a rocket launcher, ohh don't forget about his girlfriend and baby magically appear faster then the Oracle jumping around the matrix to meet neo. I mean wow ohh wow.

In the end, would I say entertaining to say the least? Not even, some food for thought on current world politics, maybe but, going overboard to a point where US, Russia and China all nuke arab countries? LOFL that was hilarious, he states everyone has the mind of a child? TO FIND THIS MOVIES PLOT BELIEVABLE IS TO HAVE THE MIND OF A CHILD. Its like an ultra radical cult of bernie sanders, who see the big picture but offer no solution. And this nincompoop even less and just makes those who believe in a cause look bad and give the opressors more reason to point finger and call the kettle black. In the end just another form of opiate of the masses this film is.  So to the naive gullable crowd whether you hate this film or go ohh yeah kill the rich cool cool. Your both being fooled on both sides. Its nothing more then another cheap ala Micheal Bay sensationalism to grasp your emotions and NOT let you see the big picture.  No anarchism is not right wing and no one guy is not gonna start a revolution of so called right wing anarchists.",1527033600,,2893,4.252727272727273
8621143,2,B00G6SO7A4,"Distasteful. Quality of effects were great, but I was kind of sickened by the plot (if there was any actually present) simply being a guy angry at the world and executing innocent people. If that's your idea of a good movie... Enjoy!",1526256000,2,233,4.571428571428571
