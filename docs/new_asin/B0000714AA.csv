7973493,5,B0000714AA,The movie is fun to watch and good to have if your a xena or hercules fan. The story is interesting it's about making dreams come true even the characters dreams if you watch the movie.,1121299200,5,185,4.166666666666667
7973494,3,B0000714AA,"If you are watching this for Lucy Lawless, know this: her cameo is less than a minute. HOWEVER, I love this movie. The lead character is cute and loveable. Diehard fans of Hercules and Xena will recognize quite a few folks from both shows, and seeing Micheal Hurst as something other than a sidekick is nice. Also, no one uses any fake north american accents! YAY!

Neither the video nor the audio quality is great on this, but I just love the story. If you are totally into XWP or HLJ, then go ahead and splurge. Those who want to see Lucy in something other than a leather warrior outfit might just want to borrow from a friend.",1096329600,15,630,4.338983050847458
