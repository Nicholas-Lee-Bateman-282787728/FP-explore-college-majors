1873062,5,B00008YGRY,"The X-Files has been off the air for almost a year now... yet, I don't think there is anything on TV replacing its quality or stating the kind of questions this show asked during nine years.
The eighth season brought the gratest challenge for the series: David Duchovny decided to be only in ten episodes. So, without Mulder, the writers decided to create a new character: agent John Doggett. The greatest surprise of this season was not actually its mulderless side, but how surprisingly good the new character was. Robert Patrick plays John Doggett in a fantastic way: he is agressive, he believes only in what his background allows him to believe, but most importantly: he is the most loyal and devoted partner. A big leap from Mulder's dettachment (he has greater worries: a quest, a mission).
In spite of the odd chronological development of the season (Scully's pregnancy period was 12 months!), it was great: I think it is one of my favorite ones along with the third and the fourth.
The season opener two parter (Within/Without) shows Scully and Skinner trying to find Mulder, Kersh being promoted to Deputy Director (to whom Skinner will have to answer now), and a big operation on his part, which seems to point only to Mulder as an insane man, who made himself disappear to prove that his beliefs were true. So, Kersh gives this assignement to the most inadequate agent: Doggett. Short Mulder sightings point to Kersh being right (if we hadn't seen Requiem, of course), but as this great two parter advances, we discover that it is fact the bounty Hunter destroying evidence (which could be in Scully's computer and in Gibson Prayse's DNA). We get so many great things in these two episodes! The most interesting images are those of Mulder being tortured in a spacecraft. By the end of Without Scully receives the news that she has been assigned a new partner: John Doggett... whose investigation on Mulder's disappearance is not over yet.
The season continues for several episodes steping aside from the Mulder's abduction arc. Patience is about a sort of Batman... but not the one from Gotham city, but from the most provincial enviroment... and, of course, this is an evil bat-man. It is a pretty good episode, and it has Scully trying to see the case through Mulder's perspective. Then comes one of the best standalone episodes of the series: Roadrunners is a disturbing, graphic and very well written episode, which has Scully trapped in a town populated by a cult that worships a worm-like creature. It is painfully inserted into a person's spine. Of course, Scully is considered by this cult to be the perfect host for this worm: Scully pleading for her baby's life is just disturbing. Of course, by the end, Scully learns to rely more on her new partner.
Some less fortunate episodes follow this four-in-a-row glorious ones. Invocation is interesting only because we get to see there a bit more of background on Doggett, Salvage and Surekill have nothing special to them... but these three episodes are pretty much all the lame ones of the season.
Via Negativa is one of those odd stories which ends in a dream-like fourth act, which is hunting, mesmerizing and beautifully achieved. Redrum is an episode center in a man who perceives time backwards, of course, Scully and Doggett have not much to do in this one, but it is interesting from the man's point of view (and it is one great performance). It has the viewer going to a murder, and it is like a crescendo that ends in yet another great fourth act. Badlaa seems to be just a normal episode, but it is great: a hindu with powers over perception is seeking revenge by killing people, and it runs paralell with Scully trying to perceive reality as if her eyes were not to trust: she wants to perceive through Mulder's eyes. Her tears by the end of the episode show what a great episode can come from a moster of the week story. Medusa has Doggett underground being Scully's eyes: it is a very good episode which advances with a good pace.
Then, there are Per Manum, This is not happening, Dead alive and Three Words. Four mythology episodes. The first is about Scully's pregnancy: what is in her? Is it a normal baby or an alien? The second one continues the search for Mulder. It is the return of Jeremiah Smith and Theresa Hosse. The end of this chapter is greatly made: Scully running to find Mulder death, and then going back to Smith (who is the only one capable to bring Mulder back to life) and competing with a UFO, against the which we all know she can do nothing. In Dead Alive we get to see Billy Miles again. Mulder returns by the end of this episode after a very complex set of explanations, which can only be accepted by watching the episode, and not by reading a synopsis. The last episodes of the season are very good: in Vienen we get to see the black oil; in Empedocles, Dogget's background is more deeply shown; and Alone is the final standalone of the season and it is very good: it is meant as a tribute to us, fans.
Finally, the only cliffhanger-less season finale of the series: Essence and Existence. It is Scully's moment to give birth to her child, but an army of the so-called Super soldiers seems to be after her. These are two action packed episodes that end with the most elaborate parallel actions of the series... as Scully gives birth accompanied by Monica Reyes and an ""alien invasion"" headed by Billy Miles, Doggett and Skinner try to avoid being killed by Knowle Rohrer and another agent-alien-replicant-supersoldier.
Here is my TOP for this season:
10. Via Negativa.
9. Dead Alive
8. Within/Without
7. Alone
6. Vienen
5. Badlaa
4. Roadrunners
3. This is not happening
2. Per Manum
1. Essence / Existence

1873085,5,B00008YGRY,"I have been a fan of the X-Files show for many years, and I'm very happy with my X-Files Season 8 Blu-ray purchase here at Amazon.  I have read in the internet of some customers having problems with the Blu-ray transfers of this Season 8, and unfortunately a few different retailers are still selling the old defective Blu-ray transfers.  As many customers also stated, that the defective transfers involved unwanted Black Crush in the transfers of the X-Files Season 8 Blu-ray episodes.  As a result, many episodes in the Season 8 Blu-rays were too dark, and hide details in many scenes in the episodes.  Fortunately, as many people have commented, including myself, I'm very happy that Amazon is carrying the new X-Files Season 8 Blu-ray transfers, as many other retailers may or may not be carrying the new blu-rays. I recommend to any X-Files Season 8 fans to purchase there Blu-rays here at Amazon because you will be very happy with your purchase.  Amazon is simply awesome!!, Excelent Customer Service, Very Good Prices, and excellent variety of products.  My Number #1 place to shop online is here at Amazon.

1873112,4,B00008YGRY,"I'm a huge The X Files fan! Seasons 1-6 are stellar, seasons 7 and 8 are good, and season 9 is, in my opinion, markedly inferior to the rest of the series. I have been hoping for a Blu-ray release of The X Files for years. Im pleased to say that these new HD transfers are quite nice. Both the video and audio quality are a notable upgrade over the relatively poor DVD releases of the show. That said, The X Files Season 8 Blu-ray set had pronounced black crush issues throughout. Its worth noting that this problem is not present in any of the other seasons and the season 8 transfer, aside from the problematic black crush artifact, is great. The day they were released, I purchased all 9 seasons of The X Files on Blu-ray and my original season 8 set DID have the black crush issues. Rather than fiddle foo with Fox's return program, i just decided to wait a while and purchase a new season 8 set from amazon and see if the corrected discs were shipping. I can confirm that as of the latter half of July 2016, the season 8 Blu-ray set that i received from amazon contained the corrected discs and was free from any black crush issues. I A/B'd my old/original season 8 Blu set with the set i recently received from amazon and the difference was night and day. Visually, season 8 now looks in keeping with the rest of the seasons. SO....assuming amazon continues to receive their season 8 stock from the same place, go ahead and buy The X files season 8 Blu-ray set with confidence. :)",1469750400,7,1486,4.348920863309353
1873133,5,B00008YGRY,"I noticed the price drop on this and picked it up for under 10.  However, after reading recent Amazon reviews and reviews from other forums, which suggest the Black Crush issue persists, that Fox has refused to recall Season 8 on account of this issue, and that they have been claiming that the issue is rectified and so are reticent to supply consumers with replacement discs, I can't help but question the timing of my own purchase.  I found it extremely interesting that Fox's webstore shows Season 8 as the only XFiles Blu Ray on Backorder at the moment.  If it's true that this flaw in the discs continues to exist, then shame on Fox for continuing to create an inferior product and hopefully Amazon is not distributing a defective product.  I'll find out soon enough I suppose.
UPDATE:  I received the set this evening and am glad to share that it appears to be a corrected edition.  It has the new sticker upc code.  Because I've read that this doesn't guarantee a remastered copy, I put it in the disc drive on my computer.  I don't have a bluray disc player, but it did indicate dates of  8/2015 and 12/23/15.  This is significant because Fox supposedly remastered the discs in December following consumer complaints of the Black Crush effect.
I then looked up some screenshot comparisons and then compared them to my disc (namely, the Roadrunner-episode 4).  The picture quality is clean, crisp and more natural as compared to the defective copies.  At 10 bucks, it's worth picking this up.  With a 1-2 month turn-a-round, perhaps Fox is vamping up quality control to ensure everyone gets a solid copy.  Best to All.",1469491200,,1626,4.69964664310954
1873134,3,B00008YGRY,"Got the Blu Ray at Target in July 2016, new UPC ending in ...81 was stickered over old one that ended in ..80 but the discs are still the older batch with black crushing problem, contacted Fox for replacement discs but they claim these should be the newer discs with fixed picture. Checked disc on computer in BluRay drive and file dates are indeed from August-October. The newer discs where the problem is fixed should be December 2015 file date for first episode file. Best Buy has some with newer UPC in stock too but would not recommend buying until guaranteed new fixed stock appears.
Update: Amazon stock seems to be the new revised discs as of July 2016, I got mine last week.",1467849600,5,683,4.516129032258065

This season is no different. I also didn't mind the 2 new FBI agents either. As long as they didn't replace Scully or Mulder and Chris Carter had already explained that that would never happen.

I miss the interaction between Scully and Mulder and yet I could have welcomed Agent Dogget (I like the actor and at first he seemed a good fit) if it didn't seem like Scully's doubting Thomas mantel was put on Dogget's shoulders, and Scully, no longer wearing her ever-present cross on a chain, was made to step into Mulder's shoes (the meticulous scientist/doctor presto-chango morphs into Mulder light.) Everything that worked in the previous seasons has become hokey in Season 8. And Gillian Anderson does NOT look like she's having a good time.

While researching quality differences between the DVD and blu ray versions of X Files, I came across the website wwwdotxfilesvaultdotcom/features/Season-8-Black-Crush-Blu-ray-Problem/.  It explains how early productions batches of Season 8 have an encoding problem that results in very dark ""black crush"" portions of the video.  It offers comparison screen captures and a way to contact Fox Customer Care for replacement.

I received replacement disks free of charge (including shipping both ways) in about 10 days and the new disks do not have the encoding problem.  Kudos to Fox Customer Care for quick service.

I immediately played as many episodes as I could in each disc and the colors are like the previous Blu-ray releases. I do not notice off black levels like I'd seen from someone else's Blu-ray edition. Those black levels were downright noticeably off in that copy.

I do not like to assume, but it makes sense that the studio may have fixed the issue as promised it would be by March. I did not expect it to be first week of March. I was planning on using the exchange program after receiving this, but doesn't look like I have to. Mainly because for some reason I thought I'd read somewhere the issue would be fixed by late March. Guess I was wrong. And glad I might be.

However, while watching the Season 8 episodes, I noticed that something is wrong with the picture. The colors are all wrong. The darkest areas on the screen are so black that you can't see what's going on. Even in the daylight scenes, the colors look too dark, compared to the earlier seasons and even to my DVDs. What I'm reading in the online forums is that there is a major encoding error on these discs. I'm an RN, not an engineer, so it's Greek to me. The iTunes and other streaming services don't have this problem, so this must an issue with the encoding on the Blu-ray discs themselves.

I have emailed Fox with this information in hopes that they will issue a corrected version. Until they do, I do not recommend that this season be purchased. The other seasons look amazing.",1450656000,18,1039,4.550802139037433
1873444,2,B00008YGRY,"I really love the series, however watching season eight was a big disappointment for me. It's definitely the worst season of the show.
But apart from the content itself, this release made me even more disappointed. Something is wrong with black levels in season eight - most of the scenes are overly dark. It can't be watched without raising brightness on blu-ray player and the tv set. As far as I know, this is a problem known as ""black crush"". I own the complete box and other seasons look very good. Hope this problem will be noticed and fixed somehow. For now - I don't recommend it.",1450396800,14,588,4.5046728971962615

1873578,5,B00008YGRY,"After having low expectations based on what I had read about the changes on the show during this season, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shows. It blew away season 7. And Agent Doggett, rather than being a cheap fill-in character actually became a strong part of the show. Like previous seasons, the shows that carried along the main storyline were very good (if not, perhaps, as compelling as some previous seasons). Maybe the biggest surprise was that the other shows (those unrelated to the main story) were very strong as well, probably better, on the whole, than in previous seasons.",1440374400,,605,4.826923076923077

Its like I always said back when it aired on TV;  ""Its just like getting a free one hour movie to watch every week!""  Back in the day when there were REAL SEASONS of 15-20 episodes instead of the 5-6 we get today! I'm not always a big fan of the writer's concerted effort to paint anyone of faith to be a psychotic, weak willed, brainwased, indvidual in his story lines. I do, however really enjoy and appreciate his incredible imagination and unpredictable paranormal stories. Just riveting! I highly recommend season 8.",1437177600,,585,4.615384615384615

1873758,5,B00008YGRY,Season 8 is the last of the best Mulder and Scully Xfiles. Season 9 David Duvachi disappears from the xfiles except for a few cameo appearances.  Robert Patrick is a fine actor but not Fox Mulder. Not sure why Chris Carter had David leave if he did or David just wanted to do other work. No one seems to be saying why. I did watch the whole season 9 including the final episode where Fox Mulder comes back. Did make a nice ending seeing Dana and Fox in a romantic way. Season 10 is a cartoon. One or two seasons of that is the kiss of death. The Xfiles are probably the best of the best in TV or even big screen entertainment. Enjoy.,1429574400,,633,4.104838709677419

1873787,2,B00008YGRY,"The major ark dealing with Mulder was a total washout.  The ark dealing with Doggett had a logical and satisfying conclusion.  Which I was satisfied with and Dogget's quest was the only thing which kept me from a I Hate It rating.  The Mulder ark's conclusion was clearly patchwork and thrown together.  Linking his life work to the Mayan Calender  for the end of the world was an obvious cop out to the writers inability or limited resources to conclude Mulder's quest.  We are still here, so the end of the world did not end according to the Mayan Calender.
The conclusion violated the major requirement for a story, especially science fiction, and that is believability.  Science fiction must be plausible and should never put forth a theory that is disproved by reality.  This recoils backward to downgrade the effectiveness of this shows last season.  For a more satisfactory conclusion to a science fiction series, compare X Files with Fringe.",1427328000,,949,4.88125

they just don't make them like this anymore :{
although i resisted robert patrick and annabeth gish characters at first (loved the mulder-scully arc the most)  they were very good too! this romance was a bit cheesy --like oh well it worked for milder and scully we will try it again and it didn't ring true especially as robert patrick seemed to have a crush on gillians character at first ....a little gratuitous  you know?! like its been done before ....
i think the reason why x files movie failed was that it wasn't about the government and alien aspect and about a serial murderer
the xfiles 3 movie (if its ever made) should deal with the alien invasion, the government conspiracy etc and  bring back miuder scully and asst director fbi while also addressing william and hey bring back robert patrick and annabeth gish ....

In 2001 I was a bit disenchanted with the length of the show and Duchovny's waning interests but now that I've gone back and seen all the episodes in order it really stands up. Without the prejudice of being upset with the show and a much more mature mind I believe season 8 has some of the show's best writing and episodes. I've truly enjoyed going back and watching every single season again! Thanks Prime.,1411084800,,553,4.431372549019608

Well, let me back track a little. Starting with the pilot when Agent Fox Mulder (portrayed by David Duchovny) the beliver in the paranormal ihas been notified  that he will be getting a new partner.  Enter Dr.and agent Dana Scully (portrayed by Gillian Anderson)  being the sceptic knew that she had been delibrately placed with Mulder to debunk his work.  As they start out their journey together working out one case after another, she is awed by his stubborness and his relentlessness for the tuth.  As each season goes on, they become closer and closer and without saying any of the words to each other, you know that they share an unspoken love.  With Mulder's agonizing quest for the truth seeking out alien life and thinking he may never have his answers comes to a halt at the end of season seven (7)  Mulder has disappeard and Scully announces that she is pregnant!  How and by who?  Season eight (8) answers all these questions. From Mulder's disappearance to the brand new agent John Doggett assigned to find Mulder and at the same time trying to remain focused on Dana Scully.  Scully keeps her pregnancy a secret while searching for Mulder herself.  As the season progresses, Mulder returns and realizes that this agent Doggett must be the father of Scully's baby but he couldn't be the farthest from the truth.  With season 8, the truth of Scully's baby is foretold, the jealousies of two men in love with the same woman, intense  excitement with aliens, Scully being hunted down by ""super soldiers"" and ""Existence"", the episode in which Scully gives birth.  All three of them will be bonded in some way but only two of them will come together.  Every X-file fan will have their favorite season, however, like I said before, this is my personal favorite.  .......Thank you",1410393600,3,1962,4.706744868035191

I am upset that I haven't watched season 8 sooner!  I think it's great how they transition to the new characters and away from Mulder and Scully.  This is a great season...  It's only short coming is that some of the episodes feel rushed and have too many scenes edited out, which make for some rough transitions.  Loved the way the season ended.

Half the eps do not feature Mulder , and that hurt the ratings. But this group of eps is truly very good.  On dvd this looks fine too.  The new agent Dogget is a good addition to the team and it's too bad that they don't do a movie with him and the other members.  Because Robert Patrick was excellent in that role.

1874126,4,B00008YGRY,"I assume if you are reading reviews of X-Files Season Eight, you are familiar with the series.  Other reviewers have gone to great detail on this season.  Thus I will hit just a few points... from my perspective (or is that a redundant redundancy?)  Apparently I enjoyed Season Seven better than many reviewers; I wasn't put off by the ""light"" episodes.  So this season, going back to overly dark, and everything half hidden in shadows, is not a good thing to me.  It almost seems to indicate lack of creativity.  (Calm down!  I mean within the context of The X-Files!)  It's like ""Hey, I've got a great idea.  This episode will be dark and moody.""  Like when comic books got darker and grittier.  After the first 100 times, ""getting darker and grittier"" turned into a comic book clich for unimaginative artists and writers.  (I was a huge comic book collector until... wait for it... I got married!)  So a darker tone for the season is fine, but doesn't anyone turn on a light when they read or write a report or enter a building or walk down a hall or...?  I also like the extras, and this season has more extras than previous seasons although I have the slim line version of Seasons 5-7.  I don't know if there is a slim line version of Eight.  So I may not be comparing apples to apples.  Let's just say this season has good extras.  Finally, as other reviewers have mentioned, although some seasons were better than others, even the weak episodes/seasons of The X-Files still stand up as better television than most of what has come since.  Even the season with only half a Mulder!",1375228800,,1586,4.52112676056338

1874132,4,B00008YGRY,"Robert Patrick fills in for David Duchovny in the eighth season of X-Files and the writers do an admirable job of explaining Mulder's absence. Patrick, playing agent Doggett, injects some new life into the series and his presence is felt most in the first quarter of the season, as Sully is forced to adjust and eventually must learn to trust her new partner. The situation makes for some interesting drama and works suprisingly well for the most part. The two start out by searching for the missing Mulder, who was abducted in the season seven finale, but then just take over for him in overseeing the X-Files, where Scully now plays the believer and Dogget the skeptic. The reversal is nice and makes sense, Scully is particularly interesting to watch in most episodes as she is really all alone now and struggles with what to do with the rest of her life. Patrick is also very interesing to watch, his 'new guy' role in the series must have been similar to his real-life 'new guy' role on set behind the scenes, he does his best to fill the large shoes of Duchovny's character and to be honest is a welcome change to the seemingly bored Duchovny of season seven. Still, Mulder does return for the second half of the season but his presence is never the same as it was and is more of a drag as we know he will just disappear all over again in the final season.

All in all, season eight of X-Files does its best to make up for the loss of half of its leading duo but struggles in a way the show hasn't ever before. Although much better than average television, the penultimate season of the X-Files is the show at its weakest so far.",1369785600,,1635,4.413907284768212

1874209,5,B00008YGRY,"This is my favorite season of the x files. Mulder and Scully had long ago worn out that tension between skeptic and believer. I was sick of that. Scully drove me crazy with how bad an agent she was, how she didn't support mulder and how she didn't believe what she saw with her own eyes or experience. I think the writing improved in this season, with more action in the shows and more about the ufo angle. The new characters brought new life to the show. Monica is a well drawn character as is Doggett. Both Gish and Patrick are great actors. I think Patrick is a better actor than Mulder. Scully takes on a better role, where she is now actually a believer that helps the 2 new agents. Skinner gets a more broadened role to good effect. I think the show Essence, which is the next to last show of this year is one of if not the best x file show ever made. I would watch five more years of this show if Monica and Doggett were in it. They should have kept going.",1348876800,,963,4.127659574468085
1874210,5,B00008YGRY,"This season kept me on the edge of my seat, I loved how the relationship evolved between Scully and Doggett, it was refreshing to see her grow even more without Mulder and watch as her pregnancy progressed and the search for Mulder was superb.

1874212,4,B00008YGRY,"So David Duchovny's absence basically forced the production to adapt in a drastic kind of way. Duchovny cited aspirations for the silver-screen, and a strong desire to ease off playing Fox Mulder, and pursue more ennobling roles in ""Zoolander"", and ""Evolution"".

The result is a darker, more contemplative return to form. Of course, ""dark"" in a cinematic context, is a redundant buzz word these days. So what does that mean - ""dark""? Well, cinematically-speaking - many of the characters lose the L.A. shine seen in Seasons 6, and 7. The tired Mulder/Scully polarity has been replaced with lots of questions. Characters' motives become gray, episodes evoke more contemplative malaise, and overall - the episodic rhythm has more weight.

I recommend Season 8. Imagine Season 4's tone, spliced with the T-1000.
I *strongly* recommend Via Negativa.
It's definitely the best stand alone of the season.
Mulder's later episodes begin a decline, but the show regains sure footing in the awesome two-part coda.",1323648000,2,1002,5.217391304347826

Every week I looked forward to well-written episodes that amazed me with the humor, drama, acting and creative off-beat storylines.  You get drawn in by the characters and feel part of their lives and situations.  Chris Carter, the creator of the show, changed TV viewing of what a sci-fi series could be. I was in awe, laughed until it hurt, dumbfounded by plots, emotional about the relationships and adored the actors.  Now that I've bought every single season, I can relive it over and over, again.

1874235,5,B00008YGRY,"Scully and Doggett get to work on a case that has all the trappings of oddity in motion. First there is a murder and then there is the scene and the things that are left behind. Of all of those are the trappings that look like the signs of some type of animal feeding, only an animal doesn't have a stride that tops that of a man and it doesn't ake off sets of fingers of leaves marks in wooden beams like something hanging upside down.

This is one of the first Doggett episodes involving something monstrous, and it is one of the best ones that I had seen in quite some time. The thing in the story has the impact that it is supposed to have and more, with the way it is set up looking so much like a terror. The storyline also combines in a way that seems amazing, with the clues coming together with an amazing explanation and making this out to be something that is better than it sounds. Then there are the effects, with pieces of it being protesthetic and pieces being animated and some simply amounting to the way a person manages their positioning.

I personally liked this season and I personally liked the season afterit. There is still a  Mulder presence here and a mixture of other agents, and skully pics up some of the slack with the explanations coming out of her. This shows just how much she has come to see, and how much she is fixed in the Mulder rationale. Combine that with Doggett, who has a backstory of pain and of loss, and you have something to look forward to.

In a world without X-Files, this amounts to something grand.",1299974400,,1550,4.2979452054794525

This makes season 8, in my mind, not the same as seasons 1 - 7.  However, season 8 isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Mulder returns for the last half of the season and it's really not that bad.  John Dogget is a great character and the show works well with and without Mulder for the most part.  I prefer episodes with Mulder though because I love the chemistry between Anderson and Duchovny.

If you are dying to see either Season 8 or 9, do youself a favor and just read a synopsis of what happened on-line. If you watch these two seasons, you will never get those hours of your life back...

Mulder is still a part of this season and his absence for the first half is not an issue.  He appears sporadically in flash backs in these episodes as well during the first half.  What I thought was really cool in this season was the fact that (SPOILER COMING UP) it is revealed that Mulder had an advanced lesion on his temporal lobe, which any advocate of neurobiology knows can cause one to have ESP experiences, whether there are legitimate is an issue for academic debate.  Overall I enjoyed this season a whole lot and the picture is in great quality.  THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANY FAN OF THE X-FILES.",1250467200,,735,4.488721804511278
1874241,5,B00008YGRY,"I like others here are truly devoted to the X-files. When this season started out I had a hard time with Robert Patrick, not because I don't like him but he isn't Mulder. The character's attitude was almost too much and too opposite to take in the beginning but he did come around and in fact showed why he was picked for this job and how good the writers were. I liked how the writers move in agent Reyes with Doggett and I agree if they wanted to go maybe a couple or so more years they could have done it even without the Scully character. That doesn't mean Scully wasn't great but in fact that the new actors were holding their own. After Mulder comes back and then you have Mulder, Scully, Reyes, Doggett and of course A.D. Skinner you can really see how good those actors were in this series and how well cast they were. But after watching 8 out of 9 seasons in succession one funny thing that I related to was that the characters were trying to do their jobs amidst of all the political stuff of the FBI, which was not unlike my 12 year careeer in the Navy. Even though I liked all the seasons I particularly like following the alien abduction and or colinization parts, but I also know that without the other ""side stories"" it may have gotten old fast.",1250208000,2,1260,4.2761506276150625
1874242,5,B00008YGRY,"I grew up watching the X-Files. Ever since I saw 'Ice' in season one, I was hooked. I had the largest crush on Fox Mulder for years on end, eventually covering the walls of my teenage bedroom with Duchovny's face.

As the seasons wore on, I found myself growing less and less interested in the show as what got me hooked in the first place were the horrifying, mysterious, and outright scary plots and the PLATONIC relationship between the main characters.  If I wanted to see romance and all that mushy stuff, I would have tuned in to soap operas etc.  I came to the X-Files to be scared, to 'think', and be entertained by the cases.  The outstanding partnership between Mulder and Scully was just icing on the cake.

As I said before, my interest, even as a die-hard fan, began to wane around season 5.  I don't recall even tuning in to the second half of season seven.

But then, there was SEASON EIGHT.  I couldn't believe how radically my X-Files fandom would be altered by this season.  I, like many other fans, was prepared to hate Doggett with the passion of a thousand suns.  Insead, over the course of the first few episodes, I found him to be extremely endearing, intelligent, considerate, honorable, and dedicated.  The partnership that I saw develop between doggett and scully was like that which I loved so passionately in the first two seasons between Mulder and Scully.  Pure heaven!

As I proceeded through the season, I found myself absolutely falling head over heels over Doggett's character.  THIS was the character that I had been subconciously yearning for.

My real moment of truth in season 8 came when Mulder returned from 'the dead' (I sometimes think the show would have been better off if he had not returned) and finally met with Doggett.  When Mulder shoved Doggett, I was bewildered to find that I sided with DOGGETT over MULDER, the character I was obsessed with for years growing up.  My fandom has never turned back.

I own all seasons of the X-Files, yet I find myself watching s8 the most often.  It is the season filled with OUTSTANDING acting, creepy episodes, and a great mytharc. In my opinion, this is the best all-around season next to seasons one and two... back when Mulder and Scully had a platonic relationship and the show focused on the cases, not romance.

The only negative thing about Season 8, in my opinion, is that the CSM was not in a SINGLE episode. What was that about!?!  Thumbs down.

Anyway, Season 8 is top notch and worth checking out!

The new guy is interesting in a different way, even though the chemistry is different between the two. I have to admit I do not like the new girl at all, though.

1874264,4,B00008YGRY,"I enjoyed the x files from start to finish mainly because it was smart, hip ,engrossing, and intelligent. I also finally got the eight season and am very pleased with it. I must disagree with those who say that Robert Patrick can/did fill David Duchovny's shoes and was just as compelling as Duchovny. Patrick , while a solid actor,has none of the charisma and sex appeal of Duchovny. I actually found him to be plodding at times. The x files was truly built around the relationship between the mulder and scully characters and its gradual blossoming over the run of the show. The loss of Duchovny in the eight season just heightens ones awareness of this fact. His absence from the show , however,was made less poignant because his name was mentioned frequently. Duchovny also brought a vulnerability to the fox mulder character that robert patrick simply could not match. I did enjoy "" release""- not so much for the acting ( with the possible exception of cary elwes and the young actor who played the cadet) but for the beautiful, haunting, mark snow music. Just great! it was definitely a different season for the x files but still better than most of the shows on tv today.",1236556800,2,1178,4.668269230769231

1874269,5,B00008YGRY,"While the 8th season limits Mulder to only a few bit parts, it strengthens Scully to a sharp point. Gillian's performances remove any doubt that she is a capable actor. She carried the last 2 seasons with strong supporting roles from Patrick, Pileggi, and Gish.
While many see the 8th and 9th season as the [...] stepchildren of the X-Files, I see them as genuine extensions of a truly great television series.

I am disappointed that Chris Carter did not use Patrick and Gish in his latest movie. I feel that their contribution would probably have increased it's viewership. But then again, maybe many of the X-Files viewers were just fair weather fans to begin with. This could be the reason so many disliked the last 2 seasons and then vilified the ""I Want to Believe"" movie, which I felt was a very well written, if not a swan song, to a most memorable show.

I am one of those fans who watches the season over and over...and even though I have seen them 3 times each, I gain more insight into the world that Chris Carter created!",1218499200,,1034,4.49468085106383

And that gives the plot for Season 8 of The X-Files. The show has taken a completely different direction. It has a completely new plot and even a new agent. Robert Patrick, who played T2 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day is great as Doggett and everything seems to fit together flawlessly.

And that moment is this.

1874297,3,B00008YGRY,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. This season is in Widescreen 1.78:1

X-Files: Season eight is the one where Mulder leaves the show (in order to pursue a career in film acting) only to appear part time. You may even be in for Mulder's death. The show begins with a brand new introductory credit sequence which actually looks very good and there are two versions, one containing Mulder leading and one without Mulder with Scully leading. This way you know if Mulder will make an appearance or not. The new agent Dogget (Robert Patrick) is set to replace Mulder as Scully's partner. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is gone from the show. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) has more of a lead role. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back as is Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is also a brand new addition. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) is really playing the bad guy this season along with the new mysterious insider Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin).

Season eight of the X-Files is mostly about - Agent Dogget, Gibson Praise, time travel, monster bats, religious cults, ghosts, drugs, alien pregnancy, x-ray vision, metal man, pain, Indian mystics, viruses, Mulder, alien black oil, Doggett's son, alien colonisation, mutants and Scully's child. Dogget is essentially the new sceptic so he and Scully have a lot of fun in the single episodes. Also thankfully Season eight completely omits the slapstick humour change that Season seven tried out towards the end. The cast update is actually not bad, and do stay all the way through with this season and don't just abandon it completely. This is an action-packed season with some great episodes.

The major problem however is not with this season but what the producers are hiding from us. You don't see this until season nine. Essentially Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is here to replace Scully. Yeah the producers are going to be moving in the direction of Special Agent Monica Reyes and Agent Dogget leading the X-Files for Season nine and possibly more. However Season nine killed the X Files. It is easy to give this series 4 to 5 stars without knowing what the producers are planning (I originally gave it 5) but when you know the truth! you can easily dock down. So Mulder essentially did leave the show in season 7 and Scully is leading for the time being but doing bit parts in season nine.",1186617600,,5855,4.738235294117647

1874299,5,B00008YGRY,"My first favorite television series was ""Twelve O'clock High"" and I remember being total shocked when the main character, General Frank Savage, was killed on a mission in the first episode of the second season.  The idea that actors leave television shows was news to me and while having a second Darrin is one way of solving the problem without radically changing the dynamic of a show, that is much more the exception (Becky on ""Roseanne,"" Miss Ellie on ""Dallas"") than the rule (especially since the original actors came back on both of those examples).  Going into the eighth season of ""The X-Files"" having David Duchovny as Fox Mulder for the entire season was not going to happen, which meant Chris Carter and his staff were going to have to reboot the show with a new male lead.  Enter Robert Patrick, best known as the T-1000 machine from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B00008PC2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a>,"" as Agent John Dogget.

Mulder had finally been abducted by the aliens in the finale of the previous season (""Requiem""), so Dogget is assigned by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (boo, hiss) to head the search for Mulder (""Within"").  However, with a tip from the Lone Gunman, this turns into an effort to stop the alien bounty hunter from destroying Gibson Praise (""Without"").  No good deed goes unpunished, so Dogget ends up running the X-Files with Scully as his less than willing partner who is hiding the fact that she is pregnant.  So of course their early cases involve a bat-like creature (""Patience""), a slug-like creature that is supposed to be the second coming of God (""Roadrunners""), a little boy who vanished ten years ago showing up and had not aged a day (""Invocation""), a killer who can see through walls (""Surekill""), and an Indian mystic (""Badlaa"").  One of my favorite episodes from Season 8 is ""Redrum,"" which brings in another ""T2"" actor, Joe Morton, as a man living the murder of his wife backwards, and which finds Dogget and Scully playing supporting roles in the story (there is also a great in-joke when Dogget complains to Scully about having to track a metallic man in ""Salvage"").

There seems to me to be a concerted effort to break up the formula here, so that sometimes Dogget has to go it alone (""Via Negativa,"" ""The Gift""), and once you pick up on that idea you see more variations on the theme.  Scully's pregnancy comes into play when she stays behind as Dogget checks out some strange deaths in a Boston subway tunnel (""Medusa"").  Scully's fears about her baby comes to a head in ""Per Manum,"" which is just before the search for Mulder is over (""This is Not Happening""), and then all Scully has to do is to find a way of bringing him back from the dead (""Deadalive"").  Scully's search for Mulder is reminiscent of his quest to find his sister, or at least what happened to her, but there is a big advantage in that this story arc lasts a dozen episodes and not several seasons.  Add to that Anderson's performance in these episodes providing more of an emotional weight than we are used to on the show.

Obviously pairing Dogget with Gillian Anderson's Dana Scully reveres the dynamic that existed at the beginning of the show when Scully was the skeptic and Mulder the true believer.  Now it is Dogget who is the skeptic, but more of a ""knee jerk skeptic"" than the rational scientist that Scully was, just as Scully is now the believer but without the burning passion of Mulder.  Dogget, who was first a Marine and then a police detective before joining the bureau, is also 40 when he joins the X-Files, where as Scully was only 28 when she first showed up).  Ironically, by the time the tension between Scully and Dogget is resolved, Mulder is thrown into the mix and since Scully's pregnancy is coming to full term we get several Doggert and Mulder episodes.  We also have the introduction of Annabeth Gish as Special Agent Monica Reyes, setting up season nine.  Mulder clearly cannot stand Dogget and wants back on the X-Files, but Kersh denies the request (""Three Words"").  Then Reyes comes to Mulder for help investigating the death of Dogget's son (""Empedocles""), which gives Dogget a chance to make it clear he does not like Mulder either.  No wonder the next episode, ""Vienen,"" finds Mulder and Dogget trapped on an oil rig manned by crewmen infected with the black oil virus.

The funniest moment in season eight comes at the end of ""Alone,"" with Scully on maternity leave and Dogget partnered with young Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins).  She might be from accounting but she has followed the adventures of Scully and Mulder, so joining the X-Files is a dream come true.  Of course it turns into a nightmare, but when she finally gets to meet her heroes and ask them about the snowcat running out of fuel in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/movie/dp/B00005221O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">movie</a>, it is absolutely hysterical.  Then things get really serious at the end as Billy Miles starts killing people and has Scully on his target list (""Essence"").  Scully needs to be protected, and Dogget turns to Reyes, who takes Scully to a remote location to finally give birth to that baby (""Existence"") and bring the Mulder and Scully saga of the X-Files to a tentative close (a ninth season was still up in the air at that point).

How much you like season eight comes down to how much you like the character of Dogget, and I think he is a solid character.  I like the way the different vibe the show has just because everybody know calls each other ""Agent Scully"" and ""Agent Dogget"" and ""Agent Mulder"" (and eventually ""Mister Mulder"").  Plus, you had to know that in the end that unless he was dead and in the ground (and not coming back) that Mulder was going to be canned by the FBI.  The most unrealistic thing on the show is not the alien conspiracy but how long it takes Kersh to pull the trigger.  For extras on this DVD there is a featurette looking at season eight; profiles from the international videos for x, John Dogget, and Alex Krycek; FOX's promos for all of the episodes; a look at special effects by Mat Beck with commentary by Paul Rabwin; and all of those deleted scenes you never saw because you missed the ""X"" when it went by with optional commentary7 by Frank Spotnitz and John Shiban (the real father of Scully's ""baby"").",1183248000,2,6452,4.838181818181818
1874300,5,B00008YGRY,"This was one of my favorite seasons.  I found the character of John Doggett to breathe new life into the show.  Frankly after seven seasons I felt the show was beginning to lose a little steam, and found the new direction a great idea.  Lastly I thought the season finale was terrific and a superior ending to the actual ending in season nine.  My reviews not that in-depth but I just want to caution any of you against avoiding this season because of ""the new guy"", he's terrific and the tensions between Doggett and Mulder are terrific, highly recommend this season.",1183161600,,568,4.594059405940594
1874301,4,B00008YGRY,"Season 7 left off on one giant cliffhanger.  I won't spoil too much, but the abduction of Mulder was a huge event in the series storyline, obviously having heavy effects on the story of the next season: eight.  This season opens up with the search for Mulder in a great two parter, which brings back Gibson Praise briefly.  From there, a new guy, Agent Dogget, serves as Mulder's replacement until his eventual return towards the last third of the season.  I find that this season is equal to season 7, but maybe a little less because of the heavy involvement of mythology episodes.  The thing is, season 7 really didn't have much to offer in terms of mythology, and season 8 is almost compensating for that, giving us an overdose.  New aspects such as super soldiers are introduced into the mix, and the writers even do some retconning to explain some things about Mulder and Scully that we weren't told in season 7, which is something of a cop-out.  Another thing that's a little disappointing is that with new characters being introduced and a much bigger focus on mythology stuff, there isn't room for comedy episodes in this series, a first since season 1.  Kersh makes an enormous comeback in this season after his absence in season 7.  He is now the Deputy Director, and in conjunction with being in charge, he's a pesky obstacle.  I like how more  characters are involved in the episodes now on the protagonist side.  We have Mulder, Scully, Skinner, Dogget, and Reyes involved in several episodes towards the end of the show, which gives the writers license to have multiple conflicts taking place at once during an episode.  The show ends on a great two parter that involves Scully's baby being born, the return of Billy Miles from the beginning of the season, and the death of a major character in the series who I will not disclose.  Adam Baldwin as a super soldier makes a great performance in his episodes, setting up his character for further use in season 9.  I will say this:  Most of the episodes in this season are good.  I wouldn't pick out any in the whole season that I would classify as bad.  As with seasons 6 & 7, we get ALL OF THE SPECIAL FEATURES from the previous DVD release again.

1874302,5,B00008YGRY,"I wanted to point out something technical about the slim set discs that I bought.  If you're looking for insight into the episodes or characters - please look elsewhere.

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.  Sure, there are episodes I can skip through.  But for me, it's good bang for the buck.  Enjoy!",1172361600,2,2967,4.381651376146789
1874333,5,B00008YGRY,"After watching all seven seasons with Mulder and Scully as the main due I was a bit hesitant over the changes that would take place over season 8.

I was happily surprised with the addition of Agent John Doggett.  The initial relationship between Scully and Doggett itself is exciting, beginning rocky(likened to Mulder and Scully's beginning) but smoothly transitioning into trustful partners.  As this was happening Scully began taking the part of Mulder as the ""believer"", Doggett taking the part of Scully as the ""skeptic"".  At times I even found myself liking Doggett more then Mulder(that makes me a trader doesn't it?).  Doggett himself has an interesting and captivating past with his late son's kidnapping, a reoccurring subplot within the last two seasons.  The only downside to the season, I never found Monica Reyes to be a character I could warm up to.  Her performance was good, I enjoyed her Hispanic heritage and her growing relationship with Scully, but there was just something about her character that was missing.  Perhaps it was the imbalance that occurred with there being two ""believers""(Scully and Reyes) and only one ""skeptic""(Doggett). All and all this was a fun season full of new relationships and new cases for the X-Files to solve(or rather, close).",1170720000,3,1279,5.086124401913875
1874334,5,B00008YGRY,"So for about $35 compared to the earlier set price of $90, I'm getting better packaging, and I won't get the extra disc of bonus materials that the sets come packaged with. Um, I think I'll go ahead and get the new reissues.

I got lucky and purchased the original first season box set for less than $40 right here on Amazon. The packaging for these more expensive sets are downright atrocious. It's one of those fold out thingies that are annoying to unfold completely when you just want to get to one disc. I felt like I was trying to take apart complicated origami everyttime I opened the set. I think if you open the whole thing up completely, it's about the length of a pool table.

Now with these new sets, the discs come in individual slipcases, minimizing wear and tear on the box itself and making it loads easier to get the specific disc that you want to watch. Also, the bonus stuff wasn't really that in depth and I can do without it. Considering that you're getting better packaging with these new reissues, it's almost like you're paying upwards of $50 just to get some behind the scenes info on a show that is even better with the less you know about it.

At any rate, I'd suggest going with these new sets, unless you absolutely have to have the extra disc of features. The transfers are top notch and best of all, you can relive all your favorite episodes of Mulder and Scully for a much more reasonable price.",1168732800,5,1427,4.3977272727272725

1874336,4,B00008YGRY,"Season 8 (21 episodes airing 2000-2001) was the most atypical of all nine years of THE X FILES for several reasons:

1. Much of the season makes due without the services of David Duchovny.

2. New characters, assuming key roles, are introduced.

3. An unprecedented percentage (nearly half) of the episodes are devoted to the mythology arc.

There is a noticeable, almost ""symphonic"", symmetry to the season (composer Mark Snow's haunting ""Scully theme"" functioning as ""idee fixe"") with the mythology arc divided into several well-defined sections: an opening 2-part prelude, massive 5-part mid season ""adagio"" and grand 2-part finale.

The loss of David Duchovny's full participation actually had the effect of re-focusing THE X FILES. Chris Carter and company were put to the test in coming up with an interesting and (somewhat) cohesive storyline that would work around the practical ( business related ) realities they faced behind the scenes. Though not without missteps, Season 8 succeeded both in revitalizing the dramatic intensity of the myth arc and maintaining the shows inexorable momentum toward a conclusion revealing much of Chris Carter's longstanding underground project.

In Season 8 Gillian Anderson became the lynchpin of THE X FILES, continuing to summon up her considerable skills in service to the show. The casting of Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett was a stroke of genius; Doggett was written and acted in complete distinction to Mulder. This well-planned strategy allowed the imaginative landscape of THE X FILES to be viewed through the fresh eyes of a new character; in the process, some of the excitement of the show's early years was regained for longtime aficionados. Additionally, a measure of stability and strength is found in the season-long emphasis of producing truly serious scripts. The result is a consistently ""dark"" mood, similar to the melancholia found throughout Season 4. In fact, only in a short midseason slump did the show exhibit signs of true weakness.

The ""stand alone"" scripts, while certainly not the main emphasis of Season 8, were noticeable improvements over the previous season:

Vince Gilligan's ultra-violent ""Roadrunners"" (his only contribution in Season 8) is the single finest ""stand alone"" of the year, a savage parody of a religious sect ( barely disguised ) combined with an homage to the sci-fi classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". This is the first episode (aired early in the season) in which it is apparent that Gillian Anderson and Robert Patrick really ""click"" as a team; a most fortunate happenstance as the fate of the remaining two years depend in large part on their convincing onscreen chemistry. THE X FILES would never have maintained its integrity had the (platonic) Scully/Doggett partnership failed onscreen.

David Amann's moving ""Invocation"" is the first of several episodes over the course of the final 2 seasons that deal with the past event that most shaped Agent Doggett: the kidnapping and murder of his son (""Empedocles"" was the other script so featured in Season 8).

Longtime staff writer Frank Spotnitz has a very prominent role in shaping Season 8; in addition to co-writing several episodes with Chris Carter, Spotnitz penned several solo scripts:

The excellent ""Via Negativa"", in addition to being superior on its own terms, has the additional virtue (shared with ""Invocation"") of allowing Robert Patrick to flesh out his character (David Lynch style cinematography adds a visually disturbing element to the storyline).

""The Gift"" is one of the strangest X FILES episodes ever produced, a hallucinatory combination of ""stand alone"" and ""mythology"", all the more bizarre for the flashbacks which (purportedly) explain Mulder's pre-abduction illness.

""Alone"" (aired late in the season) is essentially written for the elegiac touches of its final minutes, with Scully and Mulder humorously yet touchingly ""passing the torch"" on to a young and admiring FBI agent, the latter character symbolic of the legions of loyal (and often demanding) ""X-Philes"".

Regarding the failures in Season 8:

""Salvage"", ""Sure kill"" and especially the execrable ""Baddlea"" should never have been aired. One of the most valuable aspects of this complete DVD set will be to allow the viewer to bypass inferior episodes and concentrate on the otherwise laudable unity demonstrated throughout Season 8.

Regarding the mythology arc:

The aforementioned symphonic structure of the season begins with Chris Carter's two-parter (""Within""/""Without""), which has the pregnant Scully searching for an abducted Mulder.

Carter and Spotnitz collaborate on the pivotal mid season block of mythology episodes dealing with the death and resurrection of Fox Mulder. One cannot help but notice the debt owed to the 2nd/3rd season trilogy (""Anasazi"" / ""The Blessing Way"" / ""Paper Clip"" ).

Chris Carter wrote the season finale (""Essence""/""Existence""), which is the mirror image (in terms of title and plot) of the season opener. The series' philosophical (indeed, theological) underpinnings, while by no means hidden in previous seasons, are laid bare with allusions and typological references to the New Testament (as well as the metaphysics of Aquinas reflected in the episode titles).

While ""Essence""/""Existence"" was fashioned in such a way as to provide a satisfactory conclusion to both the 8th season and the series as a whole (should it have ended in 2001), it turned out that many of its themes would be carried over into what would in actuality become the final year. THE X FILES would eventually complete its long (9 year) run in artistic and spiritual unity; a testimony to the integrity of cast, writers, crew and (above all) creative vision of Chris Carter.",1156204800,79,5737,5.29042904290429
1874337,4,B00008YGRY,"The biggest issue I see with Season Eight is spacing. Most of the Mythology episodes are in the last two months of Season 8. The spacing of the mythology epsidoes and stand alones are not well done. The Super Soldier story arch frankly did not work. This is more evident in Season 9 than 8 though. The stand alone episodes are first rate. The previous reviewer stated that the show was not intersting until the last 7 episodes. I disagree, the tension in the first few stand alone episodes between Dogett and Scully were top notch. They were feeling each other out. Yes, there were times where the Dogett act of a non-believer was carried on too long. That being said my favorite episode is Salvage. Gotta love Metal Man. The Boston Subway episode was first rate also. RoadRunners and SureKill were also first rate.

What they should have done was like with Season 1 have them all be stand alone episodes.",1153958400,3,905,4.58641975308642
1874338,5,B00008YGRY,"I never got the chance to see the X Files when it aired originally. I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,2,1436,4.7023809523809526

1874340,5,B00008YGRY,"This was a great season of X-Files. I remember when these episodes were airing the controversy of having to write out Agent Mulder due to David Duchovny wanting to pursue his movie career, but in retrospect I think this worked out perfectly.

You get Agent Dogget and Reyes, who are good characters and freshen up the show a little bit after 7 straight seasons of all Mulder and Scully, plus I think it makes you appriciate Mulder all the more when he comes back; I found the return of Mulder story arc toward the end to be one of the best character development arcs in the show. It was the first time I stayed up late watching so many episodes back to back.

All in all, I really think people that feel the show ended with season 6 or 7 should give this one another chance. I wouldn't have wanted to watch another several seasons with the new characters like Chris Carter had originally planned, but just two seasons (this one and the final season) mixing things up with Dogget and Reyes worked very well.

1874342,5,B00008YGRY,"The new slimpack releases of Seasons 7 through 9-which are essentially the original sets with the extras disc removed as well as many other special features-will complete the entire rerelease of all the X-FILES in affordable editions.  I've been disappointed to find many of the special features missing in the first six volumes, but given that I couldn't afford the original editions, I'm all in all delighted to finally own my own copies, instead of relying on video stores and Netflix.

A huge number of fans of the first seven seasons have either failed to give Season Eight a fair viewing, or have refused to see it at all. This is a shame, because this is for the most part an enormously entertaining, marvelously produced season. No, it doesn't come quite up to the level of the first six seasons, which were astonishing for their consistency, but I have to confess that I might overall prefer Season Eight to Season Seven, which despite some great moments was subject to some inconsistency. The major reason people do not like Season Eight is the greatly diminished role that David Duchovny's Agent Fox Mulder played in the show, and indeed, for those of us for whom the interplay between Mulder and Scully represented one of the high points in television history, it was a major loss indeed. For all practical purposes, Mulder is missing from the first two thirds of the season, and even when he comes back, his presence adds less than one might have hoped. Still, for those with open minds, Season Eight remains a worthy successor to the X-FILE mantle.

The main reason Season Eight succeeds is that one performer achieved the near-impossible: Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett steps into Fox Mulder's shoes and pretty much fills them. It is an absolutely astonishing achievement, and I can't think of another performer in TV history replacing an iconic character and more or less managing to succeed. Doggett and Scully do not have anywhere near the ying-yang chemistry of Mulder and Scully, but they end up having a nice working relationship of their own. Scully is adamantly determined not to get along with Doggett, but as she puts it later in the season, she comes to respect his depth of character, as does Mulder upon his return. Unlike Scully and Mulder, Doggett is an FBI man, a career law enforcement professional who is more of a cop than anything else. He is stubborn, loyal, courageous, and possesses a vast amount of integrity. As an actor, I love Patrick's low, gravelly drawl (without checking to see where he is from, I'd bet somewhere from the Old South, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, or Mississippi). Like many X-FILE fans, I refused to even watch the last two seasons at the time, and upon watching recently on DVD, I'm amazed at how very much I like him on the show. With increased recent talk about a series of X-FILES movies getting started (largely coming from David Duchovny, who speaks of a late 2005 start of filming for a 2006 release), I am actually happy to hear that Doggett is going to be included.

Until the end of the season, when the story arc starts that runs into Season 9 (some would say, destroyed Season Nine) begins, the season is more monster-of-the-week in format more than anything else. Whatever story arc exists focuses more on Dana's coming to deal with Mulder's disappearance and her own pregnancy, and her reluctance to accept John Doggett has her new partner. Along the way we get a series of absolutely brilliant standalone episodes that are as striking and original as most in the history of the X-FILES.

Nonetheless, the last three seasons of THE X-FILES represent in the overall context of the series a decline. This didn't mean that there weren't many, many brilliant moments and many great episodes. But Season Six had more or less stopped the long story arcs, something that hurt Season Seven to a great degree. There were not so much ongoing arcs as remnants of arcs, a problem the show suffered since the resolution of the alienation colonization arc and the demise of the syndicate. The networks, as they always do, detested anything other than the monster-of-the-week scenario. Arcs shows are less friendly to either new or occasional viewers. Monster-of-the-week shows are very friendly to occasional or new viewers. Seasons Eight and Nine tried to reintroduce some arcs, but unfortunately they were arcs that even the most faithful fans of the show have trouble enjoying. For once, the formidable skills of the X-FILES writing staff failed them. The other downside of Season Eight was the unpleasant presence of Assistant Director Kersh, unquestionably the recurring X-FILES character with the fewest redeeming characters.

But decline or not, Season Eight still presented television at its absolute best. I will admit a pang of agony the first time the opening credits ran and began not with the familiar picture of Mulder's FBI ID, but began instead with Scully's. The greatest team in television history was parted! And though Mulder would be back for a few more episodes they would not actually be a team again. All good things must come to an end. But hopefully Mulder and Scully will ride again if the films that Duchovny, Patrick, and Carter all say they hope to make soon come off.",1143417600,21,5271,4.85761957730812
1874363,4,B00008YGRY,"Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick)carries on the hunt for Mulder who Scully and Skinner believe has been abducted by aliens. Doggett's a firm disbeliever until some bizarre things occur during the first two episodes of the season. Robert Patrick brought much needed focus and energy to the eighth season. While the eighth season didn't match the highs of the best seasons of the show it had some strong outstanding episodes and it appeared after a wildly uneven 7th season that the show might actually be on track again. Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish)was introduced as a semi-regular during this season as well working in conjunction with Doggett and Scully.

Among the outstanding episodes are one in which Doggett and Mulder check out a oil refingery rig that's pumping something other than oil, another stand out episode involves a tense one set in the deserted subway tunnels of Boston where something is literally dissolving passengers as they ride the rails. Doggett goes underground to investigate while Scully works against the clock to figure out if there's a biological contagion. The conclusion is disappointing but the episode itself is a tense 45 minutes.

The 8th season saw a return to the spookier, darker episodes that made ""The X-Files"" a close cousin to ""The Night Stalker"", ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""The Norliss Tapes"" (three terrific made-for-TV movies). There are those that argued that Patrick's Doggett wasn't as compelling as Mulder's character and I'd have to disagree--over the short two seasons that Patrick played Doggett he created a character every bit as memorable as Duchovny's Mulder and just as different.

The 8th season reduced cost set has commentary tracks on ""Alone"" by Frank Spotnitz and by Kim Manners on ""Existence"". There are also a couple of episodes with deleted scenes that you can watch restored to the respective episodes via the main menu. We also have more of those goofy international clips but all the extras on the seventh disc aren't included. The 8th season compares favorably to the first two seasons of ""The X-Files"" but not as well as when the show was in full swing with seasons 3, 4 5 and 6.

Robert Patrick does an excellent job in the show! As for the comments that Scully is gone because her character has changed,

let's try to grow up,let go of our 'box type' thinking and objectively view what is going on here. Behind the scenes,David Ducovney was getting tired of his role and wanted less to do with the show,so if you want to be mad at someone,get mad at him!

  In the script and in front of the camera Dana Scully,(understandably),after years of working with Mulder and witnessing what she has,has become the believer to Doggett's newly arrived skepticism. This role reversal is not only believable,but refreshing. For the viewer commenters who are disappointed that Scully has taken the lead role,I would say that perhaps it is time to let go of your sexual stereotypes!?

 I also would like to add that the stories may be a bit disconnected from the previous episodes, but again, this makes sense as Scully must back up some to bring Doggett up to speed.

Also the plots and story lines have just as much,if not more depth in some ways,than previous episodes. I feel that Chris Carter has brilliantly responded to the cast change that DUCOVNEY cast upon him,(no pun intended),and gave the show the fresh shot in the arm that even David Ducovney felt it needed.

 Let's all try to move forward with the flow and as my Jazz music friends would say,""enjoy it for what it is,not what you expect it to be!""",1127347200,3,1546,4.671586715867159
1874366,4,B00008YGRY,"As Scully (Gillian Anderson) sits in a big office room waiting to be questioned about the recent disappearance of Mulder (David Duchovny), a man sitting next to her gets up from his seat, gets a cup of water, and offers it to her. He tells Scully that he is an old friend of Mulder's. As they talk, Scully realizes that this man is not who he says he is. She reaches out and turns the nametag on his shirt around. When she finds out who he is, she splashes his face with water from her cup and walks away.

It is with that uneasy scene that X-philes everywhere---or, at least, those who hadn't jumped ship in Season 7---were introduced  to John Doggett (Robert Patrick), a tough, no-nonsense investigator who has been assigned the task of leading the search for Mulder, who was abducted at the end of the previous season. That tension would only increase as the season went on, as Doggett is forced to work with Scully on the X-Files as the search goes on for Mulder. And it is with the addition of Robert Patrick to the show that some say that THE X-FILES began its unmistakable descent into decline.

I wouldn't say that, exactly. Now, I'll be honest: I was one of the people who jumped ship during Season 7 in the show's initial 9-year run. It is only through syndicated reruns and DVD that I've been able to catch up with these episodes from the controversial 8th season of THE X-FILES. And I believe that, even this late in the game, there are still some things to be said in its favor.

Even if David Duchovny was in only about half of the episodes in Season 8, I think it's worth noting that this season marks a return to the darker, creepier style that characterized the early seasons of this show. Those X-philes who had begun to worry that lightheartedness and comedy were starting to take over the show in Seasons 6 & 7 should at least have been relieved to see a darker edge to Season 8 episodes like ""Via Negativa"" or ""Badlaa,"" episodes that arguably may not have been totally out of place in, say, Season 3. Indeed, Season 8 as a whole is a notably serious clutch of episodes, as Scully faces motherhood, and as the X-Files once again faces the danger of being closed down. And, in this season, even standalone episodes seem to tie into these broader character and mythological arcs. ""Invocation,"" for instance, ends with a disappointed Doggett finding no concrete answers from a mystery he and Scully had been investigating, while Scully tries to show him that, on X-files, not everything will have a neat resolution. But then Scully faces a stunning realization of her own at the end of ""Badlaa"": that, try as she might to play the open-minded Mulder role between the two, she and her rational mind can't always summon the same openness Mulder was able to so memorably for their seven years together.

The Scully/Doggett relationship has come under fire from a lot of X-philes, some of them complaining of a ""lack of chemistry"" between the two actors. I'll be the last person to admit that Gillian Anderson and Robert Patrick really ever hit it off the same way she and David Duchovny were able to from the pilot onward. Still, it's rather painful to have to state the obvious: their relationship was perhaps never meant to be full of ""chemistry."" Scully's heart has always, and probably always will be, with Mulder (as the closing moment of this season's finale ""Existence"" beautifully demonstrates). What does come across throughout Season 8 is at least a measure of respect that develops between the two. John Doggett may not be nearly as compelling a character as Fox Mulder was, but he's certainly a dedicated agent and a decent human being, one who is innocent of any of the hush-hush conspiracies and secret-keeping that seems to be part and parcel with those who are involved in the X-Files.

There is no way I can really make the case that the mythology of Season 8---the search for Mulder, followed by anticipation of Scully's miracle birth---is as convincing or fresh as it was in its first four or five seasons. Clearly, creator Chris Carter and company were basically straining to stretch out the mythology for another season, and, in crucial points, the strain began to show. Anticlimax seems to be the word of the day in both ""Deadalive"" and ""Existence"": there's a strange lack of momentousness when Mulder is finally ""saved"" in the former, and the same could possibly be said for the birth of Scully's baby that occurs at the climax of the latter. Even worse, though, the mythology had become rather predictable by this late season. ""Per Manum"" introduces a new information source for Doggett named Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin)---but perhaps I wasn't the only one to guess that Knowle Rohrer would turn out to be not as sincere as he seemed at first. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) also returns during the season, claiming to want to save Scully's baby from alien replicants looking to destroy it---but I suppose old habits die hard with the man typically known as ""Ratboy"" by fans.

Still, even if the mythological developments of the 8th season didn't totally convince (and it would get worse in Season 9), there were still some decent myth episodes to be found---""Vienen,"" for instance, is a fine, suspenseful effort (in which the black oil makes its last real hurrah); so is ""Three Words,"" which throws in the possibility that an alien invasion is upon us. ""Essence""/""Existence"" also manages to serve up some potent thrills, even if the climax disappoints.

And the standalones...well, one could argue that these were the only true glories left of the show in these latter seasons. There's only one real dud, I think: ""Surekill,"" which lamely tries to overlay a faint OF MICE AND MEN vibe to its dull story about two brothers involved in some corrupt business, one of whom has the ability to see through walls. Otherwise, a lot of these standalones hearken back to a time when monster-of-the-week episodes actually creeped you out. Some are inevitably better than others: episodes like ""Patience"" and ""Alone"" make the mistake of making silly mutated creatures the focus, while other episodes like ""Via Negativa"" and ""Invocation"" capitalized on deeper, more resonant fears to make its effect. The most interesting of them, though, is possibly ""Empedocles,"" which theorizes that evil is a cycle that spans different time periods, and can sometimes jump from one person to another. When a character dies towards the end of the episode, for instance, his wife immediately catches that evil and attacks an agent for perhaps causing his death. That, and it also has, I think, a cool teaser, as a spirit walks away from the site of a fiery car crash and enters into another person's body.

Gillian Anderson proves to be the emotional center of Season 8; for at least one year, it really was her show. From the sadness and desperation she shows in the first half of the season to the anxiety she starts to display as the birth of her son approaches, Dana Scully really went through a lot, and Anderson rarely misses a trick. Scully, of course, has become the ""believer"" to Doggett's ""skeptic,"" but Anderson doesn't simply make her character a female version of Mulder. She's a sharp enough actress to characterize her as a reluctant believer, in a way---she's the one who makes the imaginative leaps, but, listening to Anderson phrase her lines in certain episodes, you get the sense that sometimes she can't even believe the leaps she's making. It's true that her scenes with Robert Patrick during the first half of the season did not have the same frisson as she was able to generate with Duchovny---some of their scenes together in ""Badlaa"" admittedly do seem slackly paced, for example. But, if Patrick is not as imaginative and interesting an actor as Duchovny sometimes was as Mulder, he at least always manages to be watchable. He certainly does bring a presence and a focused intensity to his role that befits the character he plays. And then there's Duchovny himself, who returns in the season's second half and reminds us why it was such a pleasure to watch him and Anderson work together in the past.

As far as a rating for Season 8 is concerned: while I hovered between 3 and 4 while writing this review, I felt that I had to go with the higher rating. Mythologically, THE X-FILES has probably been played out by now, but at least it gets one thing right: the emotions evoked are as strong and deep as ever (even if the mythology has ceased to be nearly as interesting). It just shows that, even when the show is not at its best, it is still as potent a mixture of intelligence and scares as there ever was on recent television. Most fans have probably made up their minds about this season already; for relative newbies, though, I still think Season 8 is worth checking out, for all its serious faults.",1122768000,7,8840,4.71216041397154
1874367,4,B00008YGRY,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 8) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""Within"" in which recently appointed Deputy Director Kersh organizes a team, headed by Agent Doggett, to search for and arrest Mulder. He warns Skinner and Scully to stay silent in regard to the alien conspiracy theories, while the two agents deduce that the alien bounty hunter is slowly killing off subjects of the alien abductions. When Doggett reaches the same conclusion, the three follow a trail that leads them right to Mulder... Other notable episodes from Season 8 include ""Redrum"" in which a man awakes to find he is being charged for his wife's murder despite his inability to remember what has happened, and ""Vienen"" in which Mulder and Doggett work together in an effort to uncover the truth behind a series of deaths onboard an offshore oil rig...

1874368,4,B00008YGRY,"Season 8 for me was a very satisfying experience.

The stories took a turn back 3 or 4 seasons, into darker, more intense scripts, which seemed to fit Mulders replacement Agent John Doggett ( played by Robert Patrick ) perfectly.

He's now the skeptic, while Scully ( somewhat slightly unbelievably ) becomes the "" Believer"" ( is that an oxymoron..? )

David Duchovny only appears in a handful of episodes, and while overall the conspiracy episodes take a totally different turn, the individual episodes are nothing short of quality with several outstanding.

This is X-Files returning to it's best.

The only down point for me is some lack lustre performances from Gillian Anderson, who probably can be forgiven for going solo without her long-time co-actor, and somewhat let down at times by some unusual scripts- dialogue wise, to say the least.

That said, the apparent lack of chemistry between her and Doggett is more than made up for with interesting stories, great locations, some pretty gory scenes, and a highly unusual turn of events surrounding the overall show.

The highlights are clearly the clever two part openers "" Within"" and ""Without""; a perfect introduction for Agent Doggett.

"" Redrum"" another interesting time story about a man living his days backwards to learn a lesson.

"" Medusa"" Alien in the tunnels, as Doggett fights a mysterious flesh- eating bug underground.

"" Deadalive "" Mulders long awaited return.

The negatives- strangly, even the stories that didn't make much sense were still highly entertaining.

I'd admit "" Roadrunners"" was very strange- be prepared for some very gory scenes here- it's a wonder it got past the censors.

"" Badlaa"" also didn't make too much sense, but was also entertaining.

"" Salvage"" was probably the low point- a metal man goes crazy... sorry doesn't work for me.

A few bad lines from Gillian Anderson also took the award for low point.

All in all, the stand alone episdoes were fairly top notch. Skinner is in top form, and I always enjoy "" The Lone Gunman""

The X-Files in it's hey day it's not, but pleasantly surprised and satisfied I am with Season 8. A worthwhile addition to the first seven seasons.

Enjoy, and thanks for reading!",1114214400,4,2206,4.884408602150538
1874369,5,B00008YGRY,"I am a huge fan of The X-Files, and I widely consider it to be amongst one of the greatest TV shows ever created. All the fans know the supposed demise of the show after its first seven seasons. Apparently, Mulder and Scully can only work together. They were considered the nuts and bolts, and even the bloody glue that held the show together. I thought I agreed, until about a week ago when I watched Season 8 again.

I was a latecomer to the show, and Season 7 was the first season I watched in full when it was broadcast in the UK at the start of 2000. Therefore, I didn't have as much nostalgic memories about the previous six seasons with Mulder and Scully, so a drastic change such as the departure of Mulder in Season 8 didn't seem like such a big deal to me. Okay, the show is definitely better with both Mulder and Scully in because they are just two parts of a whole. They fit together and have an on-screen chemistry that runs Buffy and Angel's into the ground! But some people were so obsessed with this pairing that once they knew Mulder wouldn't be in the large majority of Season 8, they refused to even watch it, calling it terrible and boring! Those people will never change their minds on the last two seasons of this show, which I think is a great shame because this is actually one of the strongest seasons of the show.

I originally believed all the haters of Season 8 and approached it with much caution. Did I really want to be watching these episodes, one after another only to be let down every time? There was only one way to found out, and that was by watching the bloody things! What I found surprised me because, yes, for a little while I was noticing the absence of David Duchovny, but I soon forgot about it, because what stands in his place are some really superb stand-alone episodes. The writers and producers of the show knew that they had to write some amazing stand-alones to make this a good season without Mulder. Gillian Anderson is as her best in Season 8 out of all these seasons. She conveys such a tremendous variety of raw emotions. The arrival of Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett was the reason a lot of people disliked this season, but over the episodes here you grow to love him. He's a great character, that's all there is to it. The addition of Monica Reyes later in the season was also what some people considered the final blow to the show, but I disagree. She's nothing like Scully. She's a bit of an airhead, and you learn to love her caring character, especially in the finale.

The mythology of Season 8 is one of my favourites, and it is certainly much stronger than it was in Seasons 6 and 7, and possibly even Season 5. With Scully revealing her pregnancy and Mulder abducted in the Season 7 finale, the two-part opener of Season 8, ""Within/Without,"" is a stunning search for Mulder in the middle of the desert. It's also two episodes where Scully and Doggett are forced to work together and their conflicting opinions come to a head. After ten stand-alone episodes, we are treated to four back-to-back mythology episodes. The first is ""Per Manum,"" which focuses on Scully's pregnancy and the fact that a dangerous organisation could be killing mothers of babies once they have just been born, to hide something about the experimentation of alien DNA on human ova.

""This Is Not Happening"" sees the returm of Jeremiah Smith who had the power to heal any injured people no matter what their condition in the Season 3 finale. In this episode, he is healing alien abductees who have been returned to Earth, but there's a darker secret at work. This episode also sees the return of Mulder, but who is dead on arrival. ""Deadalive"" is the next episode, where Mulder is buried, but dug up again and found to actually be alive. With the help of a cure, Mulder is fully restored to life. This episode also sees the return of one Billy Miles from the first-ever episode of the show, which shows just how wrong the rebirth of an abductee can go if not treated with a cure.

""Three Words"" is an action-packed mythology episode which sees Mulder breaking into a high-security government facility to extract information about his abduction, and other secrets. It's also a great episode which deals with the tension between Mulder and Doggett as they come to blows over Scully. The next stand-alone is the superb ""Vienen,"" which deals with the reappearance of the black oil on an oil rig offshore of New Mexico. The focus in this episode is how the oil is being killed off inside its host. Radiation is ruled out, as the oil itself has elements of radioactive qualities to it. Mulder and Doggett work together on the rig, against Deputy Director Kirsch's orders (and against each other to begin with) but ultimately strike up a great partnership in which they are able to discover the extend of devastation on the rig.

""Essence"" is the second to last episode of the season and is a fantastic one which deals with Scully's pregnancy. Her baby is thought to be in danger from a group of people intent on stealing the baby. They fear that it could be the ultimate human being, because of how Scully's ova were experimented on. This is continued in the season finale, ""Existence,"" where Scully and Reyes are forced to go into hiding hundreds of miles from home to escape Billy Miles who is now a super-human machine intent on destroying everything in his path to get at the baby. This episode is one of the most action-packed of the entire scene, includes some shocking twists, and includes a high-speed car park chase mixed with Scully's pregnancy as the people who want to take her child watch on. A superb ending.

As I said before, the stand-alone episodes of Season 8 are truly exceptional. The first is ""Patience,"" in which Scully and Doggett investigate a bat-like creature that is attacking people in remote areas of woodland. ""Roadrunners"" is one of the most shocking and disturbing episodes of the show's entire nine-year run! Scully stumbles amongst a community of strange people who live out in the middle of the desert, away from civilisation. They worship this massive slug-like creature, which they implant in people. It then takes home on their spines and lives there, before ultimately destroying its victims. These people are obviously very deranged, and the way they trick Scully into staying with them so they can implant the slug is just so freaky! This episode made me scream and cringe!

""Invocation"" is a very scary episode which focuses on a young boy who goes missing in 1990. Ten years later he is found again. He should be 17 years old, but he's still the same age he was when he went missing. His mother doesn't care because she's just got her pride and joy back, but strange things start happening. ""Redrum"" is a great episode which focuses on a man who is suspected of killing his wife. However, time begins to travel backwards for him until he can predict how and where his wife will die, so he can hopefully prevent it from happening. ""Via Negativa"" is a superb episode which should have fallen flat on its face, due to the lack of both Mulder and Scully. However, Robert Patrick put on a stunning performance in this episode about the fine line between illusion and reality in our dreams. ""Surekill"" is a bit of a boring episode in which two brothers can see through walls to fulfil their desires. They shoot drug-dealers from behind walls, then steal all their money.

""Salvage"" is another rather boring episode, but I think it has a great and original storyline. A man was used as a test subject with metal in a terrible experiment gone wrong. He sets out to exact his revenge. He is extremely strong, obviously, being made of metal. He can wrap a car around himself when it's travelling at 40mph towards him and has the power to punch holes through 4 inch-thick steel doors. ""Badlaa"" was one of my favourite episodes of the season in which a small Indian man takes host in the stomachs of people, ultimately killing them, but getting to live their lives through his eyes. ""The Gift"" is a bit of a poor episode in which Doggett investigates a man/beast creature which has the power to cure illnesses. This episode also reveals that Mulder had an incurable brain disease because he visited the creature some time at the start of Season 7.

""Medusa"" is another great episode where Doggett and Scully investigate a strange new chemical which is living in a train tunnel and eats away at the flesh of its victims. It's a truly horrifying episode, but fascinating nonetheless. ""Empedocles"" is a good episode which deals with a man who can't help killing people. He has visions of the victims as being totally burnt. Reyes sees this also and links this back to a case she investigated earlier in her career with Doggett when he son went missing. ""Alone"" is a great episode where Scully is sent on maternity leave. Doggett is assigned a new partner, a certain Miss Harrison. She's a bit obsessed with Mulder and Scully's past exploits, and let's her imagination run away with her. I was worried she was yet another addition to the show, but thankfully this is the only episode she appears in. Together, they investigate a creature which blinds its victims with a spray, before devouring them. Mulder is also excellent in this episode.

All in all I found Season 8 to be a great season of The X-Files. People don't like change, which is why the Mulder-lovers hated this season. Don't get me wrong, I love Mulder as much as the next guy (he's bloody gorgeous!) but by the end of Season 7, the show was in desperate need of a revamp. The new characters in John Doggett and Monica Reyes provide this. FOX was providing the show with a $4 million an episode budget, which is a lot of money, but I think it was well spent because some of the sets in this season are very beautiful. A lot of people say that Chris Carter didn't want to let go of his multi-million dollar creation, but would you? I know I wouldn't. If you disliked this season, watch it again. You might find yourself surprised.",1111795200,8,10061,4.580788450860633
1874370,5,B00008YGRY,"I think I owe an apology to a couple of people involved in the making of this show.

Robert Patrick - sorry I didn't think I'd be able to take you seriously as a lead after 7 years of getting to know another character.

Chris Carter - sorry for thinking you couldn't continue this show properly without Mulder around.

Quite simply put, Season 8 is as good if not better than every other series before it. What before I thought would be a deathblow for the show - Duchovny's exit - was actually a blessing. With a new character taking his place, the writing had to change rather significantly. No longer could you more or less write the dialog between Mulder & Scully by just putting in a selection of lines from the previous shows and then riffing off that, which is sometimes how it felt during Season 7.

That doesn't explain why every single episode is absolutely superb though - perhaps that one fresh thing sparked all these new stories. Whatever happened, this is a must own set.

The 2 parter Within/Without opens the season and pretty much sets the tone. Dark, violent and graphic - exactly how The X-Files should be and should always have been, no messing around with supposed ""comedy"" episodes that just make a mockery of the show. After the opener we have Patience, Roadrunners, Invocation, Redrum, Via Negativa, Surekill, Salvage, Badlaa, The Gift, Medusa, Per Manum, This Is Not Happening, Deadalive, Three Words, Empedocles, Vienen, Alone, Essence & Existence - and they're all superb. No need to individually address them.

If I had to be critical about anything, I would say that for Scully to shout ""This Is Not Happening"" when her whole world is falling apart is quite out of place and seems to have just been put in there to have that phrase bookend the show, though quite why that's so important is anyone's guess. Another valid question is who all those people at Scully's baby shower are when we know she doesn't really have any friends other than Mulder, and also that there have been threats on her childs life from unknown assailants already. Seems somewhat careless of her.

These and other small holes in the writing aside, this is the best season of The X-Files, but probably only if you've been following it for a while. The standalones are of top quality and new comers will definately enjoy it, but I think you'll need to have some idea of what's been going on in the last 7 years worth of the show to follow along - lots of old faces turn up.

I can only hope Season 9 ends this show as well as this season would have (and, should Season 9 be awful, will for me).

However, a disclaimer. The intros to each disc in this set contain HUGE spoilers - for example, they show the death of a major character AND who kills him, revealing what should have been a very dramatic moment after years of build-up from the moment I put in Disc 1. I'm not sure who exactly put these together, but I'd just like to tell them that they are an idiot and thanks for ruining that for me, you total asshat. If you haven't seen the season before, and you're reading this before you buy it, I urge you to turn away from the little intros to each disc and wait until the menu appears.",1111190400,3,3193,4.481927710843373
1874371,5,B00008YGRY,"A huge number of fans of the first seven seasons have either failed to give Season Eight a fair viewing, or have refused to see it at all.  This is a shame, because this is for the most part an enormously entertaining, marvelously produced season.  No, it doesn't come quite up to the level of the first six seasons, which were astonishing for their consistency, but I have to confess that I might overall prefer Season Eight to Season Seven, which despite some great moments was subject to some inconsistency.  The major reason people do not like Season Eight is the greatly diminished role that David Duchovny's Agent Fox Mulder played in the show, and indeed, for those of us for whom the interplay between Mulder and Scully represented one of the high points in television history, it was a major loss indeed.  For all practical purposes, Mulder is missing from the first two thirds of the season, and even when he comes back, his presence adds less than one might have hoped.  Still, for those with open minds, Season Eight remains a worthy successor to the X-FILE mantle.

The main reason Season Eight succeeds is that one performer achieved the near-impossible:  Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett steps into Fox Mulder's shoes and pretty much fills them.  It is an absolutely astonishing achievement, and I can't think of another performer in TV history replacing an iconic character and more or less managing to succeed.  Doggett and Scully do not have anywhere near the ying-yang chemistry of Mulder and Scully, but they end up having a nice working relationship of their own.  Scully is adamantly determined not to get along with Doggett, but as she puts it later in the season, she comes to respect his depth of character, as does Mulder upon his return.  Unlike Scully and Mulder, Doggett is an FBI man, a career law enforcement professional who is more of a cop than anything else.  He is stubborn, loyal, courageous, and possesses a vast amount of integrity.  As an actor, I love Patrick's low, gravelly drawl (without checking to see where he is from, I'd bet somewhere from the Old South, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, or Mississippi).  Like many X-FILE fans, I refused to even watch the last two seasons at the time, and upon watching recently on DVD, I'm amazed at how very much I like him on the show.  With increased recent talk about a series of  X-FILES movies getting started (largely coming from David Duchovny, who speaks of a late 2005 start of filming for a 2006 release), I am actually happy to hear that Doggett is going to be included.

Until the end of the season, when the story arc starts that runs into Season 9 (some would say, destroyed Season Nine) begins, the season is more monster-of-the-week in format more than anything else.  Whatever story arc exists focuses more on Dana's coming to deal with Mulder's disappearance and her own pregnancy, and her reluctance to accept John Doggett has her new partner.  Along the way we get a series of absolutely brilliant standalone episodes that are as striking and original as most in the history of the X-FILES.

Nonetheless, the last three seasons of THE X-FILES represent in the overall context of the series a decline.  This didn't mean that there weren't many, many brilliant moments and many great episodes.  But Season Six had more or less stopped the long story arcs, something that hurt Season Seven to a great degree.  There were not so much ongoing arcs as remnants of arcs, a problem the show suffered since the resolution of the alienation colonization arc and the demise of the syndicate.  The networks, as they always do, detested anything other than the monster-of-the-week scenario.  Arcs shows are less friendly to either new or occasional viewers.  Monster-of-the-week shows are very friendly to occasional or new viewers.  Seasons Eight and Nine tried to reintroduce some arcs, but unfortunately they were arcs that even the most faithful fans of the show have trouble enjoying.  For once, the formidable skills of the X-FILES writing staff failed them.  The other downside of Season Eight was the unpleasant presence of Assistant Director Kersh, unquestionably the recurring X-FILES character with the fewest redeeming characters.

But decline or not, Season Eight still presented television at its absolute best.  I will admit a pang of agony the first time the opening credits ran and began not with the familiar picture of Mulder's FBI ID, but began instead with Scully's.  The greatest team in television history was parted!  And though Mulder would be back for a few more episodes they would not actually be a team again.  All good things must come to an end.  But hopefully Mulder and Scully will ride again if the films that Duchovny, Patrick, and Carter all say they hope to make soon come off.",1107388800,13,4812,4.841075794621027
1874372,5,B00008YGRY,"Yes, David Duchovny is gone for half of the season but the addition of John Doggett was very refreshing.  It helped bring the show back to its dark roots.  The episodes are reminiscent of the earlier seasons.  Of course the difference lies in the absence of Fox Mulder.  Gillian Anderson's performance throughout this season was stellar.  She was at the top of her form.  I also enjoyed the musical score, that song that came on whenever Scully's loneliness and Mulder's disappearance were the focus.  ""We Are Near"" I think the song is called.  I believe Chris Carter explained that in the extras.  Anyway, there's not a single episode I can point out as low quality or just plain bad.  The return of Fox Mulder was pretty dramatic but a little far-fetched, considering how it was all played out what with Mulder being dead and then coming back to life.  That was weird.  Otherwise...I don't think the show should've ended at Season 8 because there were still so many unanswered questions, especially regarding Mulder's fate in the FBI and with those in the Bureau who would've liked to see him and the X-Files go down.  Getting to the point, buy this if you don't mind that Mulder's gone for half a season.  Definitely buy it if you're an X-Files afficionado.",1102377600,3,1260,4.69406392694064
1874392,4,B00008YGRY,"Season eight was a great season, even though many of my friends stopped watching the show somewhere around season six or seven. However, I don't understand why the show didn't call it quits after this season. In my eyes, ""Existence"" is the series finale.

This season helped pick up the slack that seasons 6 and 7 were creating. Even though a lot of people don't like this season due to the absence of Mulder, Doggett is a pretty good fill-in (or replacement, whatever you want to call it). The only thing I thought was a bit too much, was the whole ""Mulder's resurrection"" thing. Although this show always delt with strange occurrences, that was a bit of a stretch for me.

I think any fan of the X-Files should own seasons 1-8 (hell, even season 9 if you like it...).",1097366400,4,769,4.485714285714286
1874393,4,B00008YGRY,"I watched The X-Files since Season 2, saw every single episode since, and caught most Season 1 episodes in reruns.  Firstly, I think, on an average episode basis, Seasons 3 and 4 were the best, especially in terms of dialogue.  Secondly, the mythologies rose and declined independent of the average quality of a season;  Seasons 5, 6, and 7 had some fantastic mythology episodes compared to Season 2 mythology episode style which was slow-paced and boring with poor dialogue, despite its wonderful overall stories.  Season 8 added vigor to a mythology series that lost quality after Season 5.  In contrast, Season 9 had some high-quality stand-alones, but absolutely horrible mythology episodes, except for the finale which was well-done in style and dialogue, but felt a little uninspired in story.

While I agree that the loss of Mulder was somewhat problematic, his and Scully's interaction in Seasons 6 and especially 7 became quite dull, as writers were unable to come up with themes that were different enough or stories that were interesting enough in many cases.  The majority of Season 7 episodes were uninspired, though there were some gems, while Season 8 allowed a whole new dynamic.

Robert Patrick brought a great, well-acted character to the show.  While Scully's reversal feels forced and while Patrick's character may pale in comparison to Mulder, the latter's seven-year run meant that he had lost steam;  in short, Season 8 Doggett (Robert Patrick) was far better and more interesting compared to Season 7 Mulder since he was new, interesting, and hadn't been explored.  Sure, there are some stinkers, mostly in the middle of the season.  However,
Within/Without,
Invocation,
Redrum,
Via Negativa,
The Gift,
This Is Not Happening/DeadAlive
& Essence are all great, dynamic and interesting -- rivalling most episodes found in Season 4.

Even Empedocles has great subplot interaction between Monica Reyes, Doggett and the returned Mulder character that is exciting and refreshing.

There are some terrible episodes:  Roadrunners, Surekill, Salvage, Badlaa, but these are no worse than some episodes in Seasons 5 through 7

Middling episodes with nice interaction and dialogue -- even if their overall stories were a bit uninspired -- were:
Patience
Alone

with Per Manum,
Three Words,
Vienen,
and Existence continuing the trend started in Season 6 of drawn-out mythologies, with repeated themes and action-oriented scenes to make up for the lack of dramatic innovation.  Still, any episodes featuring Mulder have great appeal if only for the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and the romantic angle to his relationship with Scully which is very charming.  Overall, if you liked Seasons 5 through 7, and aren't fanatical about seeing Mulder for the sake of Mulder, but like good stories and have an open mind, BUY SEASON EIGHT.",1090281600,6,2845,5.213186813186813
1874394,5,B00008YGRY,"Well what can I say about Season 8 of The X Files, this is definetly the best year of the nine.
The big talking point of this season was obviously David Duchovny's absence for half of the episodes and the full time inclusion of the wonderful Robert Patrick as Special Agent John Doggett, Scullys new partner.
As far as the show is concerned of the 21 episodes there wasn't a bad one to be found. With Patrick's inclusion the show had very much reverted back to its horror roots and delivered a collection of the greatest stand-alones ever. ""Paitence"", ""Roadrunners"", ""Invocation"", ""Redrum"", ""Badlaa"" and ""Medusa"" are all examples of The X Files at it's terrifing best. Two stand-out episodes this year were both Doggett centric episodes, proving what an incredible asset Robert Patrick was, in ""Via Negativa"" Doggett and Skinner team up to investigate a series of grusome and unexpained deaths and in ""The Gift"" Doggett comes across a case that Mulder hid from Scully and the FBI and which may shed light on the reasons for his dissapearance. This episode also marks the return of David Duchovny.
Season 8 was also the most mytholgy laden year of the nine, ranging from the search for Mulder in the incedible two-part season opener ""Within/Without"" to his return in ""This Is Not Happening"" (which happens to have the best cliffhanger ever) and ""DeadAlive"". Mulder's search for answers to his dissapearance in ""Three Words"", the unexplained death of Doggett's son in ""Empedocles"", the retun of the black oil in probably the most visually stunning episode ever-""Vienen"" to the mysteries of Scullys pregnancy in ""Per Manum"" and finally her delivery in the brilliant and action packed two-part season finale ""Essence/Existence"". Amidst all the mytholgy episode towards the end of the season there was room for one fantastic stand-alone episode, ""Alone"". Written and Directed by Frank Spotnitz this is a must see for any fan.
I really can't begin to say enough about season 8, it was a show very much re-energised and re-focused to doing what The X Files dose best, the acting all round was incredible, Robert Patrick and Gillian Anderson(this was her finest year) were incredible and the two work wonderfully together, and even though I wasn't missing him it was great to see David Duchovny back as Mulder and the chemistry between he and Robert Patrick is something that has to be seen to be believed. One other thing that made this season all the better was the increased inclusion of surrounding characters. A.D. Skinner played brilliantly by Mitch Pileggi had his busiest year, Krycheck was back with a bang, Deputy Director Kersh was back, last seen in season 6, The Lone Gunmen showed up now and again to lend a helping hand to the new guy and finally the introduction of Special Agent Monica Reyes who would be seen alot more in season 9.
Anyway it really dosen't matter how much I write I could never do this season justice or the work of everybody involved so buy it and experience it for yourself, I garauntee you will not be dissapointed.",1087948800,5,3045,4.846449136276392
1874395,3,B00008YGRY,"Season Eight of ""The X-Files"" offered a chance for a fresh start and a resolution for some of the threads from various story arcs left unresolved over previous seasons. Creator Chris Carter had been distracted during Season Seven with writing and producing ""The X-Files"" movie and, as a result, the quality of the show slipped a bit. Still, the series managed to continue to be at the vanguard for television programs. A lot of risks were taken during season 8. It would have been easy to conclude the series after Duchovny left the show. Instead, Carter and his crew used the opportunity to create a number of fresh characters and new story arcs that touched on familar themes.
John Dogget (Robert Patrick from ""T2"") stepped in to work on ""The X-Files"" and assist Scully. Dogget's no nonsense down-to-earth approach reminded me of Scully early on in the series. His background as a beat cop and Marine made him the perfect skeptic as Scully's character became a believer. Moncia Reyes (Annabeth Gish) surfaces as a new partner for Dogget and the ""Mulder"" of the two of them although, again, she combined elements of Scully's character as well. Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes from ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Kiss the Girls"")made a perfect foil for Dogget, Reyes, Scully and Skinner. Dogget also acted as the perfect foil for Mulder. Initially, they didn't get along at all and continued to butt heads over the various explanations that Mulder puts forth for some of the unusual situations.
About a third through the season Mulder vanishes--going into hiding as the super soldiers and others are out to kill him. That leaves Scully virtually on her own except for her new partners. Season Eight had many outstanding episodes and, although it wasn't up to the standard of seasons two through six, eight and nine had a number of strong stand-alone episodes. Among the stand out episodes are ""Redrum"" about a man who may have murdered his wife who is forced to relive his last days on Earth going backward in time from the moment he's killed until the actual incident. We also get ""Medusa"" where Dogget and must travel the subway system to find out who or what is literally dissolving passengers. The dank, dark subways provide considerable tension in the mode of ""Alien"". The resolution was a bit of a surprise as well. Scully also gives birth to her baby towards the end of the season. She's being hunted by a group of unstoppable alien/human hybrids. Meanwhile, Dogget and Mulder must try and protect Scully and find out who's behind the attempts to kill Scully's unborn child.
The picture quality is, generally, very good except for the darker sequences. Compressing four episodes onto one two layer disc means that some sacrifices had to be made and some short cuts had to be taken but it still looks better than most series (particularly ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and even some of the ""Deep Space Nine"" boxed sets). There's a number of very nice extras including deleted scenes (some of which can be viewed as part of the original episode if you select that option prior to watching the episode or viewed separately with optional commentary). I could have cared less about the international clips but they are amusing. The commentary tracks are particularly enlightening. With the price reduced for this set, it's well worth picking up now although I'd recommend Costco.com as they have the best price on the series.",1087171200,2,3437,4.8668941979522184
1874396,2,B00008YGRY,"Well, I'm just chiming in to this debate. Before the DVDs I had never even seen the X files. I saw the movie, but I found it strange and hard to follow. Of course, this turned me off to the series as a whole. Before my seven month deployment, I had never even seen an episode of the X-files.
A friend of mine purchased the series for me as a gift to watch on my long boat ride. And, happily, I am proud to say that I watched season one through six on pins and needles on my laptop in a small, little rack.
I was so intrigued by the alien abductions and the chemistry between Mulder and Scully. Even some of the more quirky and silly episodes were good because of the M/S combination. Yet, as the seasons moved foward I could see a definite interest with directors and producers to move the series foward while maintaining to the crux of the story originated by Cris Carter.
A story that couldn't move forward.
But, onto season eight.
Well...I just finished watching it, and well...I don't know. It was good...there were some episodes that were very good. Yet, the whole season was wooden and unfilling. Obviously, the chemistry between S/Dogget was lacking.
Seriously, I thought it would have been a better idea to bring in a more radical character to oppose Scully's logic truth. It just seemed that she made the switch from logic to paranormal very suddenly and without explanation. I mean...yeah she had something to explain...and you need to watch the season to understand...yet...there wasn't enough explanation.
Also, why couldn't they have made this a Scully season? Where she takes on the X files by herself to discovers the real truth? Yet, to they bring in this wooden guy, who I can never get over being the new terminator. And, to try and make the chemistry happen. Well, as I'm sure they (producers, etc) knew the chemistry never happened, and this season felt wrong.
Don't get me WRONG. There were so good episodes. But, the series fillers just weren't good. They should have paid David D. serious money to continue on. But, they went ahead with the the lackluster contribution.
So, my finale! There is some contribution to the X files that is worth seeing. Plus, this season sets you up with the conclusion to season seven and season nine. I haven't seen season nine yet. But, believe me, I will give you my thoughts when I see it. I decided not to add my overview to seven because generally the entire season was a true X files season. I just thought I would warn you about this season.

1874397,2,B00008YGRY,"The Eighth Season's stories were bad, but the final 5 episodes were the only Good ones. But Scully would always be a serious and rational scientist. She never had an open mind and she will never really have one. Only Mulder had one. Agents Doggett and Scully, were not really a good matchup. It would have been good if Robert Patrick had only been on for a couple of episodes, but after Season Seven the show went Down hill. But as a big X-Files fan, there have been better seasons than this. Season Nine was more Respectable than this. It seems that Chris Carter kind of lost it and the writers couldn't create good stories without Mulder, because Mulder was always and still is the driving person of the x-Files, if Mulder was killed the X-Files would be gone completely. Agents Mulder and Scully were a better match up. Even though Kersh had said that having Doggett on the X-Files rather than Mulder was a better thing. But real true X-Files fans would not agree that Doggett was better than Mulder and that Doggett and Scully were a better match up, than Mulder and Scully.",1086048000,,1078,4.533333333333333
1874398,5,B00008YGRY,"Until just recently, all my wife and I had were The X-Files Seasons 1-7 on DVD. We watched 1-6 of these seasons with rapt fascination, enjoying each one it its turn.
Then we watched Season 7 and thought, ""Hmmm. Something is different. The episodes are lighter, somewhat goofier, more humorous...but, thankfully, Mulder and Scully seem to be getting closer emotionally.""
In other words, even though Season 7 contained a few good episodes, we thought it was the weakest season we had watched to date.
Since I knew David Duchovny's character (Fox Mulder) essentially left the show at the end of Season 7, I didn't have high hopes for Season 8. I read a few Amazon reviews and was expecting Season 8's stories to be just as fluffy, uneven and unsatisfying as those of Season 7. So I held off buying Seasons 8 and 9 until just last week. (I'm a completist and I really *had* to have all 9 seasons, even if they weren't up to par with the first 1-6.)
What a mistake! I shouldn't have waited! Season 8 is amazing!
Season 8's episodes are darker, more intense, and better written than any I've seen in a long time. Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), whom my wife and I were all set to dislike with a passion -- because he took the place of Fox Mulder, one of TV's most all-time enjoyable characters -- surprised the heck out of us.
Robert Patrick is an excellent actor, and his character has shown a lot of depth, emotion and change over the course of the 15 episodes of Season 8 we've watched so far.
We tend to measure a show's Creativity Quotient by how often our jaws drop and we say, ""Wow."" Season 8 of The X-Files caused us to do that a lot. So many times we wouldn't go to bed until 11:30 or later because we had to watch episode after episode to find out what happens next.
We did that tonight, in fact. We just watched the episodes where Mulder comes back from the dead (""Deadalive"") and the one following (""Three Words""). We were blown away -- totally swept away by the emotion Scully felt for Mulder, completely caught up in the unfolding story lines.
That's how the entire Season 8 has been for us, actually. Each episode took us by surprise. We haven't been let down by a single episode in this season! Really. Of all the seasons of The X-Files we watched, Season 8 surprised us the most. It just flat-out surprised us.
If Robert Patrick had not been such a great actor, and if the stories had not been so gripping, the loss of Fox Mulder would have sent The X-Files into a tailspin. But it's impossible not to like Agent Doggett. The character showed that he's a man of ethics, loyalty and determination. In his own way, Doggett is just as driven to find ""the truth"" as Mulder is.
The bottom line? Season 8 didn't spiral downward. And it certainly isn't as weak as other reviewers have lead you to believe. Instead, the writers and directors and actors in Season 8 reached deep and made the show about STORY rather than CHARACTER. The solid stories have carried the day. And then some.
If you haven't yet purchased Season 8 of The X-Files because you've read some negative reviews, please reconsider. If you don't think The X-Files could be any good without Mulder, please think again.
I'd rate Season 8 of The X-Files right up there with my favorite seasons, which are probably Seasons 3-5. Season 8 offers incredible stories, powerful emotions, and a new character (John Doggett) that you'll respect and, eventually, grow to like (and admire) quite a bit.
I highly recommend Season 8 of The X-Files.",1085270400,103,3509,4.5362776025236595

I have to say I am a big X-files fan!  Man I got T-shirts, and have tape recorded many episodes, including many from seasons 8 and 9.  I love the 9th season, just as much as I love the 1st season and the entire show in general!  The Lone Gunman, Alex Krychek, The Alien Bounty Hunter, Gibson Praise and many more characters return for the last two seasons.  I do not understand why people are so dissatisfied with the last two seasons.  Perhaps they too misunderstand them!

1874400,3,B00008YGRY,"After 7 seasons of great stand alone episodes and and overly complicated mythology (which was pretty much wrapped up at the end of season 7) and David Duchovny minimizing his role, the series had to change - before it got too boring even for the die hard fans. The introduction of agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) was supposed to be the series' 'new blood'. Has it worked? Yes and no. Unfortunately, it's mostly no.
The introduction of Agent Doggett was an attempt for a refreshing and grounding look at the whole alien conspiracy which got out of hand of reason in the past 2 - 3 seasons by having a fresh skeptic doubt the whole alien scheme to rule the Earth, etc. But it wasn't convincing. As for the stand alone episodes - nothing much was new, and a lot of the material felt recycled. Since Mulder wasn't around much, and Scully wasn't around a lot more than he was, their interaction was sorely missed.

1874401,4,B00008YGRY,"I guess you have already seen the series as an x-file fan so I will move on with spoilers and such:
  First of all the 8th season is better than the 7th season. Even though the best episodes of the 7th season can't compete the ones of the eight season, the worst episodes of the 7th season also can't compete the ones of the eight!!
  The worst episodes of the series will at least be mediocre, but watchable and ""traditional"" if I might say.
  Here are some of the negative aspects of the eight season:
1. The atmosphere feels different than the usuall x-files episodes and it takes a while for the viewer to get accustomed to some of the changes and the abscence of Mulder.
2. The pair of Doget-Scully can't compete with the great pair of Mulder and Scully and the jokes and black humor.
3. Mulder is missed mostly because we don't hear his great lines and jokes.
4. It seems that some of the episodes lack coherent construction in the story that result in mediocre episode.
5. The concept of the x-files goes a bit further but I don't know if this is bad or not.
6. Mulder dies....lives they went too far. There is an explanation of course but I believe that his death went beyone the limits and they should let him aside without killing him.
So I go on with the good aspects of the series.
1. The concept of the x-files expands and even though it is a bit far fetch. The concept of the conspiracy is very interesting and I hope that in the 9th season they will conclude this as they did with the sixth season.
2 John Doget after the few first episodes gets a more active role and with the introduction of some new characters the series gets an interesting turn that doesn't allow the viewer to be bored.
Having read many negative comments about this season I expected it to be far worse that it actually was. In no way can the series compete with the first 6 seasons but its also far better that the 7th season and its good to see the alien conspiracy story move on through the episodes.
My only objection is that if they paid attention to some details such as the dialogues in some episodes which aren't given much consideration, and if they tried to make the episodes more ""logical"" and coherent this would be a surprising good series. Some details and mediocre episodes doesn't make the series that good.
 To conclude I could give the series five stars but I will have to wait and see how the 9th season goes and how it answers some questions raised here. If they wrap the story nice then this series gets 5 stars. If 9th season sucks and the whole cospiracy story isn't told the proper way then this one is for nothing.",1084147200,2,2627,4.338085539714868
1874432,5,B00008YGRY,"I almost didn't buy this set because I was afraid of ruining my opinion of the show with a bad season.  Many shows get stale and formulaic as they age.  Happily, this is not the case with ""The X Files.""  The season's story lines of the search for Mulder and the pregnancy of Scully were very well done.  Robert Patrick as Special Agent Doggett is absolutely great.  I was led to believe that Mulder wouldn't be in the season very much, but he is in better than half of the episodes, and whether there or not, he is felt.  Even so, Doggett is a strong agent and he and Scully work well together.  The production values, writing, and acting are all top notch, just as they have been with every other season.  I especially enjoyed the alien conspiracy story line since, in the past, I felt it got a bit too convoluted and forced certain rather wide leaps of faith.  It was very well done in this season.  The stand alone episodes were all freaky/scary/interesting, just as they always have been.  My one complaint of the season is Annabeth Gish as Special Agent Reyes.  Gish isn't comfortable or believable as an FBI agent.  Her supposedly endearing quirks to make her likeable fall flat.  I hope she gets better, but I wouldn't mind an alien getting ahold of her.  Despite Gish, no fan should miss this season.",1083628800,2,1308,4.483050847457627
1874433,1,B00008YGRY,"Ah, the chaotic flaw that is the eighth season of the X-Files. Where on earth shall I begin?
 Unlike other seasons, the eighth season ushered in absolutely nothing! The first (and possibly second best) season brought Mulder and Scully together and started the REAL mythology (The Erlenmeyer Flask 1x23). The second season (the best) improved the storytelling techniques that were sure to improve in the  spectacular and brilliant third season. The fourth season is when Mulder and Scully seem to lose ground to the global forces surronding them. When Mulder is infected with the black oil and Scully finds out that she has inoperable brain cancer. The fifth season set the mythology up as a war, a 'battle between heaven and earth' as Krychek said it. The sixth season basically wrapped the mythology up and season seven ended having Mulder abducted and Scully pregnant. Season seven also gave birth to stupid season eight and stupid season eight gave birth to horrible season nine! I'm sorry...I got wrapped up thinkin bout the good ol dayz of X-Files.
 Anywayz...
 The heart of the X Files is ripped out when 'Within' (8x01) premiered and Duchovny was nowhere in sight. It just didn't feel the same. We also had to put up with an unrecognizable Scully, who, just seems to whine and cry at the camera every chance she gets. Now, we do know as of now that her and Mulder did have something goin on behind closed doors, but, we've seen her hold it together better than this when her father and sister died! Who is this...John Dogget? What is his purpose? He just seems to stand around the whole time...lookin wooden and stiff. I would have liked to see Skinner get into the action with Scully. Carter could have left Dogget out of the picture completely. There was barely anything left to tell in the series. The mythology had be resolved, Mulder's sister Samantha was turned into starlight....or something. The Cigarette-Smoking man had become an outcast, and Mulder and Scully had already admitted their feelings to each other. Hell, there really shouldn't have been a seventh season (Which did have the title of being the worst season ever until this junk and season nine hit the streets).
 As for the mythology episodes....bah! All just piles of sweltering rubbish upon rubbish! And when Mulder does 'return', Gibson Praise gets more screen time than him! Talk about unfair!
 With Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and the REAL Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) gone, and new, absurd and dumb characters abound, this DVD is NOT WORTH ANY OF YOUR HARD EARNED CASH! Save the money and take your girl out to eat or somethin'. Whomever says this junk is more than two stars has never sat down and watched X-Files seasons 1-5. They also like crappy crap, as well. 'Deadalive'(8x15) is a crappy episode and 'Patience'(8x04...well I'm not even gonna go there). Via Negativa (8x07) is so terrible, you won't finish watching it. Ugh! As your friend and ally, DO NOT BUY THIS! This is just horrible! I can't believe they are actually gonna charge money for this garbage! They say 'Three Words' (8x18) is the best episode of the season, well no. It is just an rubbish episode! Utterly dispicable! I've NEVER in my life seen this many garbage episodes in an X-Files season (besides season nine). As far as I'm concerned, the X-Files ended with season seven. It almost brings a tear to my eye. It's sad really. I'm serious. (...)",1081900800,10,3410,4.810580204778157
1874434,5,B00008YGRY,"This season totally changed a tired concept of a long running show. It added new characters and opened so many new doors to the future of the show.
Gillian Anderson portrays a pregnant and emotional Scully, perfectly. Shes vulnerable and missing Mulder. We are introduced to John Doggett played by Robert Patrick whose on full time, whilst Monica Reyes played by Annabeth Gish is introduced half way as a part time character.
This season returns to the horror roots, much like season one, which was much needed at this point. It has some of my all time favourite episodes such as Roadrunners, Per Manum, This is Not Happening and Existence.
People complain that Mulder and Scully didn't get enough time together in this season, Mulder had cameos and needed to be centric, his abduction experiences and Scully's pregnancy wasn't discussed enough and the writers didn't make enough effort to show that Scully was still searching for Mulder in the stand alone episodes, i totally agree, but it didn't stop me enjoying this season completely which i hadn't done since season four.
Its the most underrated season and should have definately ended the show with a fantastic episode and closing scene. It shouldnt have continued into an unecessery season nine which pushed the show and the two leads too far, they simply had lost interest, along with the fans.
Watch this season with an open mind, ignore what disappointed fans say and see for yourself. It isn't the same without classic stand alone invesitgations by mulder and scully, but Doggett is definately a character that grows on you, working well with Gillian Anderson. You will be blown away by her acting this season.
Fans fail to understand that this season beats season seven hands down. Its definately a suprise how well the x files can work without david duchovny. His absence is very well explained this season, unlike the plain awful way he's written out in season nine.
Dont have high hopes for season nine after watching this classic season, it doesnt justify the show at all. What a shame it didn't end here.",1081728000,5,2071,4.8696883852691215
1874435,5,B00008YGRY,"I really think this season is just as good as 1-6. Sure, Mulder's gone for a while. But what kept me watching was the search for Mulder.
Robert Patrick as Agent Doggett comes into the picture, assigned to find Mulder. I really liked his character alot, and he's a better actor than Duchovny. But everyone knows Mulder's the top dog, since this show's been all about him from the beginning. But Doggett was a great character, and I feel he's unjustly maligned by some X-Fans. He really did a great job.
I think people just automatically rejected him because he wasn't Mulder, and I think that's unfair. What a true viewer should look at is how well the show works as a whole with Doggett, and if he's a good character. In my opinion, the response to both is ""yes.""
Also, the conspiracy is taken to a whole new level again. We're introduced to the plot of the alien replacements/replicants/Super Soldiers. They come into play as the aliens' back up plan in case the syndicate failed in making the slave race alien-human hybrids. They failed in season 6, so the aliens took on the responsibility themselves with a new plan.
The episodes were all great, and I liked where the mythology went in this season. Searching for Mulder was one of the best ideas the creative team behind The X-Files had, and I think too many fans took that for granted. However, I do feel that the show should've ended with this season and then conclude the alien mythology in a new movie. But alas, that did not happen...
Great season, great DVD.",1080777600,5,1518,4.564102564102564

My review of SEASON 8
Well, after avidly watching the x-files for eight long and genuinely enthralling
years it's finally come to this. When I was twelve years old there was little
that could draw my attention to television in quite the same way.
It's absolutely wonderful then, that Chris Carter, the proven moron behind the
X-files has managed to take those eight years, and flush them down the toilet,
followed neatly by his turd.
This is rubbish isn't it? No, no, come on,let's not pretend. We know good television
when we see it, else we would never have watched the X-files in the first place.
What we have here is bordering on brain-death. Chris Carter must be retarded
to take series eight under his surf-bum wing. Don't get me wrong, respect to
the man for making it all happen, but something has gone drastically wrong.
Existence-wow. What a conclusion. It was about as much fun to watch as running
a cheese grater over my face. Skinner decided he would turn into 'the one' from
the Matrix, firing the cheesiest CG bullet EVER into the screen, killing Krychek
(the shows last character with any remaining integrity) for ultimately, no reason
whatsoever. The plot's just gone, man. I have about as much of an idea of what's
actually going on as, say, Chris Carter, and then to top it off, they kissed.
Jeez, I waited for that for eight years of my life, I was expecting it to be
done a little better. No, a lot better. My jaw dropped so hard-I spent the next
twenty minutes being held back by my family from urinating on the television
screen.
This is what happens when people don't know when to quit. If a show has run
it's course, finish it, don't kill it. It's all horribly wrong, and anyone who
actually likes the X-files, and values everything it was, has absolutely no
reason to argue.
This is where I switch off.
(0 out of 3 people so far huh. Ha ha.) I really can't see your problem, this season is one of the worst things to ever be aired on T.V. Think about it. If the X Files had started off exactly like this, can you honestly say that you would have watched it?
Thought not.",1079136000,6,2118,4.461340206185567
1874438,5,B00008YGRY,"Well, in the original runs, by season 7 (excellent in itself) , i hate to admit it but i was getting a little tired with the X-Files and a little confused.  I still and always will love the seasons but something had to change. At the time when David D was about to bail, i took this as an immenent end. What a mistake.
As  X files fans my better half and myself have been watching them all from beginning up until season 8. We were very suprised.  I can only recommend a strong buy for this series.  The new character played by Robert Patrick is, IMHO, a very suprise addition and a welcome one. He hit the ground running,so to speak, and as a credit to his acting ability, he fitted right in as the ex marine, straight as a dye, bluesuited FBI guy -- who was stuck in the basement.  Even David D bounced off him in a few scenes and it was fun to see and certainly Gillian A and himself were a good mix.
The acting was a credit to all, the stories strong and competent, the direction excellent, and for a change the special effect looked better then something done in microsoft paint!  The series is full of suprises and we actually regret not watching them when originally out.
Overall, i think its excellent......but who knows what the future might bring...Mr Carter...are you listening...any chance of the odd TV movie 3 hour special to keep us warm in the winter...?? cmon, we know you can do it....",1077062400,5,1403,4.33587786259542
1874439,5,B00008YGRY,"I discovered the X-Files my freshman year of high school and it only took a few more episodes before I found myself hooked. Over the course of the next 9 years I watched only one show on television, not caring to involve myself in any other story but those involving Mulder and Scully. When I heard of the departure of David Duchovny I was naturally disappointed, having enjoyed the development of his character over the last 7 years. When the premiere of Season 8 first aired I had no idea what to expect, and from the very first moments on that Sunday night I knew that something unique was going to happen. Season 8 breathed a new life into a series that could well have ended like so many shows with such tenure. Every new show felt fresh and was as if the creative force behind the X-Files had rediscovered that which frightened them the most. I was enthralled with nearly every episode and even more so with the reappearance of characters I had enjoyed from the beginning. Never had felt such anticipation for each Sunday night, not since I first saw ""Anasazi"" and felt the shock of realizing I would have to wait an entire summer to learn Mulder's fate. I watched the Season finale realizing that this could possibly be the end of the series forever, and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire show. The shocking end of Alex Krycek and the most satisfying conclusion to an X-Files episode I had ever witnessed, Season 8 was something to remember. As luck would have it the show was not over yet, and fans were given one more chance to experience the web of dark tales and conspiracies brought to life by Chris Carter and his brilliant cast. There is nothing like on television today, and probably never will be again.",1075852800,3,1736,4.496835443037975
1874460,3,B00008YGRY,"I am a fan that likes all nine seasons of the X-Files.  I also like the introduction of Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish into the X-Files, although their working relationship wasn't much of a story line until the ninth season.  What deeply disappoints me with this DVD set is the very weak commentary track by director Kim Manners on the season finale, ""Existence"". He sounds like he just woke up or was on an all-night bender.  For every 10 seconds he speaks, there are 50 seconds of silence.  There is one comment he makes, however, that sums up the problem with season eight.  ""I really miss the Syndicate"".  The new consipiracy of the alien replacements for humans (remember that 1950's movie about the pea pods that have an alien that takes you over when you sleep? - same concept) is nowhere near as exciting as the Syndicate.  There are some great episodes here, though.  The first two - ""within"" and ""without"" show Gillian Anderson as a matured actress that can carry a show.  Mulder is sooo close, Scully can feel him, but not see him.  When Mulder returns and dies then rises from the dead with the help of Scully in ""This is not happening"" and ""Deadalive"", it almost felt like the earlier X-Files episodes.  Finish it off with the birth of William in Essence and Existence and you have all the episodes you need.  The rest are not up to par.  Another DVD extra letdown is an uninterested Chris Carter in a not very truthful or revealing ""Truth about season Eight"".  I'm not upset that I bought this DVD set, but I think that Kim Manners and Chris Carter should refund me $10 for their uninspired effort.  I can only hope they do better when season 9 comes out.  Oh, I almost forgot - Mark Snow's ""Scully's song"" is haunting and beautiful - some of his best work.",1075766400,2,1773,4.5109717868338555
1874461,5,B00008YGRY,"Like all others I shunned Dogget.  But now accept him--still not a huge fan.  His marine-corps hooey (like when will this guy stop acting like a steroidal twenty year old) is what bothers me, other than that...not so bad.  I really like Reyes' human flaws (sneaking smokes) while still portraying an admirable figure. But alas, Dogget's hubris is a non-factor when Mulder returns for the latter half of the season.  This is where the best episodes are found.
My two favorites are ""This is Not Happening"" (TINH) and ""Three Words.""  Although Mulder is not in TINH, other than as contractually absent stretchy-face, the emotion displayed by Dana rocks the screen with energy.  I haven't seen this great a performance from Gillian since her sister was killed.
Let's face it, if you've got all or some of the other seasons--you have to buy this one too.  You know you will, stop fighting the future...sisboomahhh",1074729600,,907,4.888888888888889
1874462,4,B00008YGRY,"I'd give it 5 stars if Mulder were in every episode. I know a lot of people hate this season for no other reason than that, but you have to look beyond it. The fact is, Mulder is in the majority of episodes in season 8. His absence allowed supporting characters to take on bigger roles, like Scully, Skinner, Krycek and The Lone Gunmen, to name a few. Also, in this season, the show becomes very action-oriented, something only touched upon in previous seasons. This is best seen in the two-part season finale, which are also some of the best episodes in the show's history, Essence and Existence. The writers take the mythology arcs in unbelievable new directions, and there is character development not seen in years. A must-have.",1072828800,4,732,4.682170542635659
1874463,5,B00008YGRY,"Just when you thought that the X-Files's time may be up, enter season 8. Even at first I was a little sceptical of Doggett entering, all I cared about was the Mulder-Scully relationship. But I decided to give Doggett (Robert Patrick) a chance. He really turned season 8 and the X-Files itself around. What a great actor, a new face and new story lines really made you tune in every sunday night. Wondering how'd they do that? when is scully going to tell Doggett she's pregnant? what the?? I highly reccomend this DVD!",1071705600,2,518,4.580645161290323
1874464,5,B00008YGRY,"This is a production after a boring season 7. Connected to season 7 finale:""Requiem"", season eight starts with a terrific double episode where Scully is trying to find Mulder, who is abducted by aliens. A new character is introduced to the series Robert Patrick seen in ""THE FACULTY"",""TERMINATOR 2"", etc. playing as special agent John Dogget. Mulder bored of being on the X-files for 7 years leaves only to return on the 2nd half of the cycle with the legendary DEADALIVE mythology movie. Scully on the other hand seems to be at the top of her game. She acts very very very well. In the beginning agent Dogget appears to be an arrogant character who is there just to keep Scully from finding Mulder. After the adventure in Arizona with the bounty hunter and Gibson Praise (child prodygy last seen in S6), Scully fails to find Mulder who is being tortured by the bounty-hunters in their spaceship.
Agent Dogget is now assigned to the x-files, and with Scully he investigates some pretty interesting cases which will bring them closer to each other and change Scully's opinion about the kind of person Dogget really is.
Favorite Scully-Dogget episodes: Patience--Human-bat creature attacking people.
Roadrunners--very scary and misterious--great graphics
Invocation--Little kid is kidnapped from a playground and 10 years later he returns looking the same as when he vanished. This episode gives us an insight on Agent Doggets son, as well.
Via Negativa--Somebody kills people in their dreams.-Very scary
The rest of the Scully-Dogget episodes are pretty boring. They give you the impression that Carter was just trying to complete the standard number of episodes foer each season.
Then Mulder returns dead after the aliens drop him in a field. Jeremaiah Smith appears here-last seen in The X-files: Masterplan. He fails to save Mulder so they burry him only to find out he might be alive and they unburry him again and after a lot of curing are able to bring hom back to live. Mulder is back---YEAHHHH.In this double episode(this is not happening & deadalive), Gillian Anderson gives the best of herself. Here she gives every female actress a taste of what dramatic acting is all about. In some scenes her crying and suffering really breaks your heart. Lets not forget she's pregnant. In the fantastic episode: PER MANUM she reveals how Mulder accepted to be her child's father. A great turm for their relationship. Super great episodes to follow are:
3 words-Mulder is back and investigates his disappearing
Empedocles-Mulder gets close to Dogget to investigate a case involving his son's death
Vienen-Mulder & Dogget investigate an oil rig infected with the alien black oil
Alone-Very scary and entertaining.
The season ends with a legendary double episode (ESSENCE & EXISTENCE)-Scully finally gives birth to her baby, but the abductees from Oregon have been turned into Super Soldiers(human replacements) and are after Scully's baby who they beleive might be something superior than them. The last Character introduced is: ""Agent Monica Reyes""-Anabeth Gish who helps Scully Give birth wile Mulder nad Dogget try to uncover the people behind the conspiracy. Agent Dogget and Reyes are no way Mulder nad Scully substitutes. They develope very nice characters. In the end of the season finale: there is a great Scene with Mulder and Scully Kissing in the mouth while holding their baby-son: William. A must have for all X-File collectors. Buy it nowwwww",1071014400,6,3452,5.08994708994709
1874465,3,B00008YGRY,"Doggett and Reyes weren't at all bad, really.  Show still should have ended after the 4th season if you ask me.  Anyway, not to threadjack, but please for the love of God put Millennium out on DVD!!!",1070582400,,199,4.351351351351352
1874466,5,B00008YGRY,"I am a die hard X-files fan. But when Season 7 came along, I felt like nothing was paying off for watching the first six years. Seasons 1-6 had hardly any faults with them, and Season 6 had the classic ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"" 2 parter that explained a bunch of stuff that fans had been wondering about. Those first six seasons were the strongest.
But season 7 wasn't all that great. It was too comedic. ""Hollywood A.D."" has got to be THE worst episode ever - well, that and ""Fight Club."" But it was full of not so good episodes. I still enjoyed it somewhat, but it was a big letdown because the first 6 were incredible, and this was Mulder's last full season, and so I felt they sort of wasted his role away, especially after we found out that his sister was dead the whole time. Blah.
But then, a ray of hope emerged in that which was Season 8. Season 7 did open and end on a great note. But even with Mulder gone for most of Season 8, Dogget was awesome. The search for Mulder was awesome. The return of Jerimiah Smith was sweet. It was a great new mythology. The episodes were back to their dark, cleverness with a little wit mixed in - instead of mostly humor like Season 7. Season 8 was the jam.
Even so, this ray of hope that was Season 8 only lasted for that year, because they didn't end the show with this season. They had to go yet another year. While I admit that Monica Reyes came into her own in Season 9, overall Season 9 wasn't that great. I'll own it, just like I own the first 7 and will own the eighth - but it still was about as weak as Season 7.
Season 8 was great. Buy it.",1070409600,3,1593,4.092651757188499
1874467,1,B00008YGRY,"There are shows that are truly ensembles, shows that can survive and flourish without one of of the main characters easily.  The X-Files?  Not one of them.
While I do like Robert Patrick, he failed miserably as a replacement for Mulder as a male lead.  His presence also coincided with the slow painful death of the real Dana Scully, so that it ended up feeling as if BOTH Mulder and Scully were gone.  If The X-Files had been a show about a special divison of the F.B.I. involving strange cases it might have worked.  But The X-Files *wasn't* about the actual X-Files, it was about Mulder's search, and the Mulder/Scully relationship (whether you preferred it romantic or platonic).  And season eight, on the whole, was about neither of those things.
Yes, there was an occasional decent episode.  But considering the above average costs of an X-File box set, I don't think it's at all worthwhile.  As far as I'm concerned the X-Files ended with season seven.
If you don't, I certainly don't begrudge you your opinion.  But the current rating for this box set floors me, and I couldn't NOT throw in my two cents.  To the season eight defenders, all I can say is I wish I could see what you apparently saw.  But every ep of this season I sat through felt like nothing more than yet another nail in the coffin of what was once the absolute best thing on television.",1070064000,23,1363,4.545081967213115
1874468,3,B00008YGRY,"Okay guys, I'm gonna have to eat my words.  I never watched the eighth or ninth season of the X-Files when it first premiered.  I couldn't understand why Chris Carter and Co. would try and replace Mulder after David Duchovny left.  I was confident that Gillian Anderson and Mitch Pileggi could have carried the show successfully throughout the eighth year, and that it could have ended with them finally finding Mulder, who would then reveal the personal experience of his abduction, what it all meant, the TRUTH, etc.  Unfortunately, I do not write for the show.  It went on, and they replaced Agent Mulder with Doggett.  This was my biggest beef with the show:  trying to replace Mulder.  Out of sheer curiosity, I would flip on the occasional episode during the eighth season, watch it for about 4 minutes, roll my eyes, and turn it off.  I was a disgruntled, former X-Phile.  I caught the series finale in May of '02, which made no sense to me, and found solace in buying the DVD sets from the seasons I loved.  Voraciously, I collected seasons 1-7 and relived the heyday of my favorite show.  Then one night, I turned on TNT, and actually made myself sit thru a couple of the episodes they were rerunning from season eight.  These episodes were ""Roadrunners"" and ""Per Manum"".  I have to admit, I was intrigued.  The quality of the show was still where it was when I left it.  The camera work, the effects, the monsters, my beloved Agent Scully, they were still all there.  I started to feel that maybe I was missing out by not giving the eighth season a fair chance.  I just could NOT get past the Doggett character.  Still, I was intrigued.  I broke down and bought the eighth season, guys.  A week later, I had finished watching, and found myself feeling stupid for almost missing out on another great season of the X-Files.  The first half of the season kinda drags, as we slowly get used to Scully's new parter, John Doggett.  Scully kind of comes off as ""less-than"" what she used to be.  She's not as intense, rather two dimensional, and is willing to believe anything it seems.  (What happened to the ""I am a scientist, trained to weigh evidence, schooled in hard fact?"")  Doggett kinda grows on you, but you secretly find yourself hoping Mulder will turn up so Doggett can leave.  The second half of the season is excellent.  Virtually all of the episodes are mythology eps, and most importantly, Mulder returns.
Yeah, this season has it's ups and downs, and it's not half as good as the first seven seasons, but contrary to what other disgruntled fans are saying, it still is the X-Files.  It's just a different kind of X-Files.  A time of adjustment.  But ultimately it still oozes the same strange and wonderful energy that drives the show.  Not sure I can say the same for the ninth season, but knowing me, I'll probably end up buying that season as well ;)  After all, I'm the kinda guy that would give ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" five stars.",1069718400,6,2959,4.564638783269962
1874469,2,B00008YGRY,"How anyone could rate this season highly is beyond me.
What's next, giving Gremlins 2 ""The Next Batch"" 5 stars?  Give me a break people.
I understand Carter soldiered on bravely after the departure of David Duchovny.  I also understand that the premise of the X-Files was ""Mulder's search for The Truth.""  Take Mulder out of the equation and what do you have?  Very predictably, a schizophrenic TV show that was forced to tease viewers with the return of Mulder in order to get ratings.
Personally, I love Robert Patrick.  His work in Terminator 2--as well as those wonderful Outer Limits episodes--was top-notch.  But here, he's obviously struggling to fit in, and the chemistry just isn't right.  I felt sorry for him--obviously if he could have made this work it would have been the coup of his career.  But by mid-way through this season it became obvious he was just there to play out the string.
I'm NOT saying don't buy this season.  I did.  But I am saying MAKE NO MISTAKE:  the X-Files died when Duchovny left the series.
Trash this review all you want.  Truth is truth.  Deal with it.  Buy seasons 1-5 and enjoy one of the finest TV series ever created--the one that finally dethroned The Twilight Zone for cult-gone-mainstream excellence.  Buy season 8 only if you are an X-Files completist like myself.",1069459200,8,1314,4.726872246696035
1874490,5,B00008YGRY,"The first five seasons of the X-Files were superb, some of the best stuff on television (although Season 4 was somewhat below average.)  Seasons 6 and 7, however, represented a distinct drop in quality, mainly because of the ""funny"" or ""spoof"" episodes.  While such episodes from the early seasons were excellent (e.g. ""War of the Coprophages"" or ""Bad Blood"",) Seasons 6 and 7 had episodes that were silly but not really funny (e.g. ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" or ""Hollywood A.D."")  Furthermore, the mythology turned into a mess in Season 7, starting with an awful plotline involving Mulder's being granted uncontrollable psychic powers by a rubbing of a spaceship, and continuing with an incredibly unsatisfying resolution of his sister Samantha's disappearance.
While some fans were disappointed with Mulder's limited role in Season 8, the season took the X-Files back to its roots.  There were no badly-concieved comic relief episodes, and the mythology returned to actual aliens, featuring the return of the Bounty Hunter and Billy Miles, an abductee from the pilot episode, now himself transformed into an alien assassin.  Nicholas Lea also gives some wonderful performances as the entertainingly villainous Alex Krycek.
In this season, David Duchovny is largely replaced by Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett.  While Doggett's character takes some time to warm to, Patrick is an excellent actor.  Also introduced is Annabeth Gish as Agent Monica Reyes, who would become a series regular next season.
As a final note, Season 8 had some truly superb standalone episodes.  Highlights include ""Roadrunners,""  featuring a homicidal cult that worships a slug-like parasite, ""Via Negativa,"" a sort of remake of - and improvement on - Season 2's ""Sleepless,""  and my personal favorite, ""Invocation,"" which gets my vote as the scariest X-Files episode ever.
Give this season a try.  Once you get over the shock of Mulder's absence, you won't be disappointed.",1068854400,5,1962,5.296774193548387
1874491,3,B00008YGRY,"The first sentence uttered by Agent Dana Scully upon discovering Fox Mulder's office being searched by FBI agents in ""Within"" (8x01) is also the first reaction of the viewer towards Season 8:
""What is this?""
It is definitely not the TV show that audiences once loved. Season 8 was drastically different and some say the death knell for one of the most popular shows in television history.
For The X-Files Season 8, the show had been bravely revamped, but most of the changes were not for the best: the slick cinematography was reminiscent of a music video and often tinted orange; the new characters lacked back-story; the average episode pacing was too languid; the new musical themes were too soapy; the standalone episodes were too recycled; the mythology was too explored and, most of all, the humorous spark found in earlier seasons was replaced by a brooding morbidity.
Why the brooding morbidity? There were many critics who felt The X-Files had become too lighthearted by Season 7. I wholly agree with their assessment, but I had expected a reversion to The X-Files Season 3 formula: dark content matter yet sprinkled with underlying humor, occasional quirkiness and an inspirational undertone. Instead, Season 8 is the darkest and goriest of all The X-Files seasons -- often too dark and gory -- and seemingly devoid of its prior uplifting center. Perhaps that missing center was David Duchovny.
For the past seven seasons, David Duchovny's beloved character, Fox Mulder, had been the axis upon which the show spun. His quests to expose a global conspiracy, to find his father's killers and to learn what truly happened to his abducted sister Samantha were overarching subplots which kept the viewer tuned in season after season. By the end of the lackluster Season 7, these various subplots had all been resolved. His character had been explored to its fullest extent. Understandably, Duchovny abandoned his status as the ""lead star;"" thus, signaled the beginning of the end for this innovative television series. To appease the rabid fans, Duchovny returned for less than half the episodes in Season 8 as part of the ensemble cast. Oddly enough, David Duchovny's timely exodus did not stop the show's creator, Chris Carter, from dragging the show onward.
Chris Carter refused to believe The X-Files centered on Duchovny's Fox Mulder. Instead, Chris Carter decided to introduce the ""next generation of X-Files agents"" starring the skeptic, Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and the believer, Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Both Patrick and Gish are excellent actors, but they lacked the amazing on-screen chemistry of Duchovny and Anderson. In addition to these new characters/actors, a mediocre subplot surrounding half-human / half-metal ""super soldiers"" was introduced. In short, Carter tried to start from scratch again, but soon found himself mired by drooping ratings and, most of all, an unwieldy budget due to costly U.S. filming locations.
The location switch from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Los Angeles, California, was a smart one when The X-Files was at its peak and had the Nielsen ratings to balance out its steep production costs. This location switch, however, was to prove its ultimate demise. When casual fans did not see David Duchovny at the beginning of Season 8, they stopped watching the series and the ratings went down the drain at a phenomenal rate. The show was no longer a hit. By the end of Season 8, The X-Files was a seldom-watched television show with a jaw-dropping $4 million per episode budget. It was a financial burden to the Fox Network who had far more successful shows at the time which cost far less to make. Had The X-Files remained in Vancouver, British Columbia, a cheaper budget might have persuaded Fox Network to let Carter remold the show with Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish as its new leads. Unfortunately, The X-Files was burning a hole in Fox's pocket and it didn't have the resources to wait for the show to gain a new fan base. Subsequently, the show bowed out with the all-too-swift ninth season.
Now, the inescapable question:
""Is The X-Files Season 8 worth buying on DVD?""
If you are a diehard fan or a pathological completist, yes. If you are a casual viewer, you may have better venues in which to invest your hard-earned money. Although this season does contain some interesting episodes and is better than the disappointing Season 7, it is not worth the expensive price tag and viewing time.
Overall...
The X-Files' Seasons 1 through 3 are excellent.
The X-Files' Seasons 4 through 6 are very good.
The X-Files' Seasons 7 through 9 are average.",1068768000,20,4629,5.012987012987013
1874492,4,B00008YGRY,"I absolutely love this season. After a boring Season 7 where the Mulder and Scully relationship was getting a little boring,season 8 introduces a whole new story line which makes the x-files even more interesting and strenghens once and for all the more than friendly relationship of Mulder and Scully. Because Mulder leaves the series in the 1st half of the season (he's abducted by the aliens),Scully is left to work on the x-files with the new agent:John Dogget who develops his own independent character very artfully and gives new life to the x-files. The ""search for Mulder"" and the ""birth of Scully's baby"" are the best episodes of the season. Scully shines in season 8 being at the top of her game. Great great acting by Gillian Anderson. Especially in ""This is not happening"", but also ""within"", ""without"" and ""existence"" she gives every female actress a taste of what real, original, dramatic acting is all about. The downpart of this season is some of the everyday monster cases that Scully and Dogget investigate together. It seemed to me like Chris Carter was just trying to complete the standard number of episodes in the season. I think this is a season worth buying for every x-files fan out there. Even though Agent Dogget's role becomes vital in running the x-files, during the 2nd half of the season Mulder and Scully continue to lead the series with their newly formed personalities:Scully-now a believer and Mulder-determined to expose the new conspiracy with the super soldiers and the alien tortures he went through. buy it",1068681600,3,1546,4.904580152671755
1874493,5,B00008YGRY,"The problem with Season 8 of ""The X-Files"" had nothing to do with storylines, new characters, or the lack of our beloved Fox Mulder (David Duchovny).  The trouble with Season 8 of ""The X-Files"" had zilch to do with editing, Gillian Anderson's hair, or giving birth to alien babies.
No, the cause of its downfall is due to all the fickle fans out there who supposedly love the show, only to bash it over the head and proclaim to the heavens how the mighty have fallen.  It's these same idiotic ingrates who couldn't stop proclaiming their passion for ""The X-Files"" during its glory years, only to turn their noses up at it just because old characters folded and new ones replaced them.
How many of you so-called true-blue X-Philes ever gave Season 8 a chance?  As soon as word got out that David Duchovny no longer wished to be involved with the show anymore, it was the end of civilization as you knew it.  Never mind that Chris Carter and all his fellow writers were hard at work to give you what you wanted.  Just ignore the fact that David Duchovny was the ONLY character leaving, and that we still had plenty of Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, Nicholas Lea, and a host of other characters to follow.  You whined and complained, bellyached and moaned, when the pop-culture phenomenon known as ""The X-Files"" began to, in your eyes, grow stale . . . only to criticize and grumble your little hearts out when the show didn't end and continued to deliver the goods every Sunday night.
You wanted more X-Files.  You got more X-Files.  And then you had the gall to gripe about it because, shucky-darn dag-nabbit, it just wasn't the same old show.  Man, talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
Season 8 of ""The X-Files"" was a monumental success, something blatantly obvious if you would only open your eyes, shut your mouth, and suddenly come to that booming realization.  What do you do to replace an actor who wishes to distance himself from the show?  You supplant him with an actor who WANTS to be there, a guy who pumps new life into the show and puts an interesting spin on its dynamics.
You hypocritical hicks get all bent out of shape because Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish are trying to steal the reins from David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson?  Don't hate; congratulate.  What, you expect Gillian Anderson and Mitch Pileggi do everything all by themselves?
GET OVER IT, PEOPLE.  If you don't like Season 8, turn if off.  Better yet, leave the room so those of us who do appreciate it and what it bestowed us can enjoy it to the fullest.
Don't believe all the naysayers on here who think Season 8 of ""The X-Files"" isn't worth your time.  It is.  These self-proclaimed X-Philes are just bitter, frustrated, and have a pile of sour grapes to boot.  Everyone at 1013 is to be applauded for the dedication and hard work they put into making Season 8 one of the most accomplished seasons in the show's run.

1874494,4,B00008YGRY,"Ok, let's get right to it.  As much as we all loved the X-files, it was time for a change of some sorts, something fresh.  I hear so many people whine and complain, but overall i think this is one of the best seasons they had.
Reason 1: Robert Patrick as Special Agent John Doggett.
Reason 2: Annabeth Gish as Special Agent Monica Reyes
Reason 3: Drama, suspense, action, and excelent storytelling
The SA John Doggett character, along with a glimbse of things to come with SA Reyes kept you watching.  The Agent Harrison character, named after a fan of the show who died of cancer ( i think) was airheaded but hopefully will get a cameo in season nine, I haven't seen it yet by thew way, don't spoil it for me!
The stories were well written, I like Skinner being more involved.  Obviously as a long time fan it's nice to see Mulder and Scully involved FINALLY.  And the search for mulder made me keep comming back.  This was one kick ass season.
Yeah some questions were left unanswered...but isn't that the point of the entire series????
Basiclly, get over it.  If you are a fan you will like at least something about it.  Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish prove the X-files will go on without it all being about Mulder and Scully.
I await the last season on dvd.  Come out soon!",1068336000,,1279,4.408510638297872
1874495,4,B00008YGRY,"Lets be honest, we all tuned into The X-Files each and every Sunday night (originally Friday night) to watch the adventures of Mulder and Scully, but by season seven it was evident David Duchovny wanted out and his heart just wasn't into it anymore.  I missed him, but it didn't take me long to embrace Robert Patrick as tough cop turned FBI Agent John Doggett.  I'm not going to say I wasn't apprehensive about the introduction of the new characters, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I think Robert Patrick did a fine job and the introduction of Annabeth Gish at the end of season eight was a nice way of introducing her before season nine, which I can't wait for either.  My only complaint regarding season eight is I believe they were trying to juggle too many main characters.  There was the introduction of John Doggett, Scully was still around, Mulder was making an appearance and there was the introduction of Monica Reyes.  I believe many fans took this as an insult when in fact TPTB were only trying to make the transition to season nine easier.  It's easy playing Monday morning quarterback when you don't have the executives from Twentieth Century Fox breathing down your neck.
I would have like to have seen more extras on the DVD's.  It's 2003 now and I don't understand why the studios skimp on this and yet they're raking in huge profits.  Fans love to see outtakes and behind the scenes action and for the life of me I don't understand why execs haven't figured this out yet.  We're not interested in seeing every single deleted scene or Chris Carter's narrative on location selection - WE WANT TO SEE OUTTAKES.  This isn't specific to FOX, apparently all the studios have yet to figure this out.
Season eight will never go down as being as strong as seasons three through five, but that doesn't mean it should be discounted either.  It's a must have if you're an X-Files fan.",1068163200,19,1893,4.617910447761194
1874496,5,B00008YGRY,"It shames me to see so many so-called ""devoted fans"" trash-talk and degrade the last two seasons of the show.  They whine and moan about Duchovny's abscence as Mulder.  If they would shut their mouths and look more closely at the man, they would see that he had no desire to be on the set anymore (check out his lackluster performances from season 5 on as compared to previous seasons - edged out in quality by even Mitch Pileggi's turns as Skinner).  Clearly Carter had to find a way for the show to go on without it's centerpiece, and he'd did so masterfully.
  As for there being any fault in Scully going from protagonist to pure believer, this is entirely plausable.  Don't forget, she's been absorbed into Mulder's x-files for almost ten years.  Anyone, when exposed to alternate possibilities for so long, could begin to think and believe differently.
  Bottom line. seasons 8 and 9 should retain every bit of respect from viewers that the first 7 did.  I only hope Carter's alleged X Files film franchise makes a comeback soon, because I'm anxious to renew my adventures with Duchovny, Anderson and the entire brilliant cast.",1067990400,4,1133,4.73469387755102
1874497,1,B00008YGRY,"Ok, Can I give this negative stars?  The problems of this season are far too many to name all of them, but let's  hit on the big one, shall we? Casting. Could it get any worse then Patrck and Gish?  Maybe it was the writers fault, did they really expect me to love the new Mulder/Scully wannabes? Dogget is a poor excuse for a skeptic, Scully may not have agreed with Mulder, but she was never as close minded as Dogget, and Reyes, the female Mulder, just comes off as naive.  The relationship between the two is laughable, I could have cared less if they ended up together, or who killed Dogget's son, or really anything pertaining to uninspiring duo.  They have none of the Mulder/Scully spark.  The only reason to watch this season is for Gillian Anderson, who gets props for sticking with the show, and for the rare Mulder episode, which every once in awhile gives a glimps of why this show was so wonderful in season 1-7.",1067904000,8,926,4.41764705882353
1874498,4,B00008YGRY,"And honestly, this season is not THAT bad.  Good grief.  Yes, we all miss the special chemistry between Mulder and Scully.  That is gone for good...at least until the wonderful final scene in the final episode of the season, when Mulder and Scully share a moment with a very special third person.
However, compared to other television, this X-files, though flawed in comparison to earlier iterations of itself, is still darn fine entertainment.  John Doggett is a nice character.  And I really like Annabeth Gish as Agent Reyes (she REALLY gets to shine in Season 9).  And there are some really nice stand-alone episodes...I like the one about the guy who turns into a lizard.
So, is this A+ X-files?  Nope.  No way.  It probably is a shame they didn't find a GREAT way to wrap up maybe back in Season 6, followed by some good movies, but they didn't.  So, we got to spend a few more somewhat flawed years with characters we love.  Skinner gets to shine more than ever.  Scully makes a new close friend in Doggett.  We get to hiss at Cigarette Smoking Man a little more.  How bad is that?",1067558400,6,1088,4.512820512820513
1874529,1,B00008YGRY,"Season 8 of The X-Files could well be a cautionary tale of what not to do when your central character asks for time off, yet agrees to return for half a season.
Don't pick a B-film actor who lacks the charisma of the actor he is replacing.
Don't write him as a black-and-white, Joe Friday-type character with a minor, uninteresting backstory.
Don't have him dismiss every paranormal theory or not by-the-book case with the phrase ""load of crap.""
Don't have your skeptic counterpoint to Mulder ~ Scully ~ suddenly attempt to take on Mulder's believer point of view.
Don't make Scully pregnancy coincide with an apparent IQ drop of about 50 points and shove her ""touchstone's"" (Mulder's) nameplate into a desk drawer so the new guy has a place to sit and not feel out of place. The whole point of the series at this point was Doggett's discomfort and adjustment at having to investigate things he couldn't wrap his average-cop brain around.
Reyes' was an attempt at Mulder-lite. She was a believer. That character also was underdeveloped and by the season finale, Existence, when she sang whale songs as Scully was in labor, she'd become a joke.
In Chris Carter's attempt to reinvent The X-Files ~ and at the same time diminish and degrade the character of Mulder, he succeeded in making Season 8 the coffin in which it was to be buried. In Season 9, he succeeded in killing it.
I wouldn't buy seasons 8 and/or 9 of The X-Files on DVD if Fox paid ME.
I DO, however, own seasons 1-7. After that, it wasn't The X-Files.  It was the NeXt Files and it failed miserably.

1874530,4,B00008YGRY,"As an X-phile who feels John Doggett and Monica Reyes contributed one more valuable chapter to one of the most entertaining and original stories TV has ever told, I've taken my lumps in discussion forums, big time. Don't get me wrong -- Mulder and Scully will always be icons to me, but Doggett was something new -- the Everyman thrown into this hellish mix of extraterrestrial intrigue and preternatural puzzlement. The cynical but earnest ex-cop reawakened the show's debate between the rational and the supernatural, and Doggett's sheer decency, common sense, and self-doubt provided a new layer of human emotion. While Season Eight started somewhat slowly following a slambang mytharc opener setting the stage for Scully's glacier-slow acceptance of Doggett, the patient viewer was rewarded by episodes such as the powerful Invocation (we discover Doggett's personal kryptonite), Redrum (a bizarre third-character tale in the tradition of Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose and Hungry), and oldstyle XF shockers Surekill, Salvage, and Badlaa. The latter half of the season was given over largely to the mythology, Scully's pregancy and its potentially sinister implications, and the closing search for Mulder (seen briefly in The Gift, which with the standalone cryptozoology chiller Medusa establish Doggett as a hero in his own right), and after Mulder returns to life and the show, we see a new dynamic -- the pragmatic Doggett wrestling for reason and respect with the X-Files skeptical founding father. Doggett eventually wins Mulder's trust -- a crucial victory as Mulder is forced to hand him the reins of the Files. The season approaches a conclusion with Alone, as Doggett flounders amid the prospect of losing Scully's guiding influence but ultimately prevails with a strong hand from Mulder. It's a rewarding prelude and transition to the two-part conclusion, which closes one mytharc door, opens another, and offers MSR (Mulder-Scully Romance) fans their magical moment. Forget your prejudices -- this is a worthy chapter in the X-Files saga.",1066953600,6,2053,5.359133126934984
1874531,3,B00008YGRY,"While there is a lot to dislike about FOX's eighth season of the X-Files, there is still a tasty kernel of appeal at its heart that improves with repeated viewing. I found the show's initial television run disappointing, to say the least - I did not like Doggett's character or the ""dumbing-down"" of Scully. This, I suspect, was a strategic balancing act to counter the fact that Doggett would be far less believable as a ""believer"" than Scully - hence, the believer/skeptic ""role switch"" for the sake of dramatic tension.
The ""alien conspiracy/Scully's baby"" mytharc became even more muddled and confusing, and the kiss of death for a show - boring. However, after seeing some of the episodes in syndication I've grown to appreciate Season Eight more. I fully agree with the comments a previous reviewer made on S8: Chris Carter should have taken  advantage of David Duchovny's ""negative space"" and not rushed to replace Mulder with an unproven alternate lead.  There would have been plenty of interesting directions the storyline could have taken, even in Mulder's absence.
Think of the numerous ""Samantha"" episodes in previous seasons - Mulder's abducted sister played a key role, often with no onscreen time! Even with no David Duchovny, Mulder's character could have been very effective as the next ""Samantha."" Some might say the show would have suffered without a male foil for Scully, but the gravitas of a ""search for Mulder"" and the presence of The X-Files' other strong chracters would have been a better move than the 180-degree shift the show ended up taking.
Some of the noteworthy exceptions to S8's poorly-conceived mytharc are the free-standing episodes like ""Patience"" (an eerie tale of a bat-like creature that can a wait a lifetime to attack its victims), ""Redrum"" (a non-linear-time theme, guest-starring T2: Judgement Day's Joe Morton as a prosecutor charged with his wife's brutal murder), ""The Gift"" and ""Medusa"" - a suspenseful Boston subway-tunnel search for a flesh-eating killer that showcases Robert Patrick's talents for portraying a cop-type character.
Conclusion: if you're a serious X-Phile, then your collection will not be complete without Season Eight. But if you are new to the series, please don't start your collection with S8 - and if you're only a casual fan of the show, you're better off sticking with the earlier seasons.",1066953600,5,2364,5.10594315245478
1874532,4,B00008YGRY,"Everyone seem's to have different opinions on this season, not many good ones at that. I admit, I went into this season pretty cynically, I didn't like many episodes that didn't inculude Mulder, and Robert Patrick's character Dogget didn't help my anger of the loss of Mulder any. However, some of the episodes were okay. I think that Robert Patrick did a pretty good job, but I still couldn't ever have respect, or love for him, as I did Mulder, so I never really got into his character until the very end of season nine. I think the season did a total turnover at the end when Mulder returned, that's where I, and I'm assuming a lot more people started tuning in again to see Mulder. I love every episode that he's in. I adore, and love the relationship with Scully and him, so I altogether enjoyed season eight, and I am going to be their the first day this season is released.",1066694400,2,880,4.404907975460123
1874533,4,B00008YGRY,"At first it was strange without ""David Duchovny"" (Fox Mulder) in the show...  He had been one of the two main characters in the show for seven year.  But by season 7 Duchovny had grown tired of playing ""Mulder"" and wanted to leave.  This did nothing to help the show in it's 7th season which clearly lacked.  It was more that obvious in Duchovny's performance that he just wasn't ""in to it"" anymore and wanted out.
The presence, life and great stories that had been present from season 1 to 4 were now absent.  They also resolved some parts of the ""Mythology"" rather quickly and very badly!  For example:
We found out that after ALL these years, Mulder's sister was now a ghost hanging out in some field with a bunch of other dead children's ghosts...  WOOP!  Also, out of nowhere Mulder's mother commits suicide because she now ""apparently"" suffers from a painfull and terminal illness (never once mentioned before till that very episode!?!) and also because all along she ""supposedly"" knew the truth about Mulder's sister (what happened to her and where/what she was now) and just now couldn't live with it anymore...  OOOOOOOOK!  Their are other examples but you get the picture.
Many people blame Duchovny's leaving at the end of season 7 for the show being cancelled in season 9.  Truth is, if Duchovny hadden't left, the show would have been cancelled in season 8!  By this time this character (Mulder) had been explored to it's limits and their just wasn't really anything interesting left to say about him...  Scully was getting there too!
When ""Robert Patric"" joined the show as ""John Dogget"" it brought new life into the show like a breath of fresh air and also brought new life into the character of ""Scully"" as well!  Now I have absoluteley nothing against Duchovny, I love Mulder...  However I noticed right away at the begining of season 8 that Robert Patric was and is a MUCH better actor than David Duchovny was and most likely will ever be!  He brought a new perspective to the show which was fresh and unique...  Duchovny returned that year for a few episodes (mostly at the end of the season) and then never returned again till the series finally the next season.
The next season they brought in a new female character named ""Reyes"" who was eventually supposed to replace Scully.  (But I'll keep that for the review of season 9)
The point is, all these strange things happening in the world and being labled ""X-files"" wouldn't have stopped if Mulder and Scully had left...  Plans for ""Colonization"" would have continued!  Their was so many things left to explore about these two new characters (Dogget and Reyes), they had just begun to scratch the surface and could have kept the show going for another 5 to 6 years easy!
Given time I'm positive that at least half of the show's fan base would have adapted (as I did) and would have stayed till the end.  Sure the other half would have left but I'm sure the show would have gotten a new generation of fans that hadn't really watched the show before but now that it had been revamped, would have started watching and would have prefered the new characters.
I fully recomend season 8!  After the first 4 seasons, I think this one's the best!!!",1066348800,12,3211,4.636042402826855
1874534,5,B00008YGRY,"In my opinion, season 8 was one of the best - and from reading the other reviews I can see that I'm one of the few.  True, it wasn't the same without Mulder.  But it gave us a chance to get to know Dogget and eventually Reyes.  And Mulder came back for the second half - so that's a plus.  The one bad thing I could say about this season is that no one ever asked Mulder what happened to him for all those months.  No one talked about it - he acted as if nothing changed.  I wanted a touching moment where they talked everything out; what he went through, about the baby , everything.  Oh yeah - and I miss Krycek - especially after he helped them out, kind of.

1874535,4,B00008YGRY,"David Duchovny's growing dissatisfaction with his role meant he'd appear in only a few episodes (in the first few episodes his appearances are more like small cameos before finally bringing him fully back until the end of the season), so character actor Robert Patrick (mostly known as the T-1000 from Terminator 2) was brought on board as Special Agent John Doggett (and as the Amazon review says, look out for a few T2 in jokes as well) who would be the new partner for the pregnant Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson).  Mitch Pileggi's role as A.D. Skinner became even more prominant here than in any season before, while another new agent was introduced in Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish).  Contrary to what most long time fans of the series have said about Season 8; I enjoyed it for the most part.  Patrick is great in his role as the skeptical Doggett while Scully's transition from skeptic to believer is progressed very nicely.  Anderson is at her best in her role now more than ever before (and even more beautiful as well), and while the episodes aren't always at the top of the show's calibur from seasons past, this was still the best prime time network drama on TV at the time.  When Mulder is finally brought back, his teaming up with Doggett on an oil rig filled with the alien Black Oil is pure bliss of an X-Files episode.  All in all, this was Duchovny's last season (up until the series finale in Season 9), but this was probably the last memorable season of the series.",1065744000,11,1483,4.598484848484849
1874536,5,B00008YGRY,"Many X-Files viwers regard Season Eight as some sort of sacriligious act on the behalf of Chris Carter, claiming it to be truly awful and the beginning of the end. However, I will always argue against this; Season Eight reinvigorated the show. The show was beginning to wane; Season Six did an excellent job of breathing new life into the series, but couldn't be sustained over Season Seven. The departure of Duchovny and the introduction of Robert Patrick as Doggett helped the show to gain a new short-livedlease of life.
Season Eight relies on the traditional horror themed standalones and the greatest emphasis on the mythology arc since Season Four/Five. The standalones are mostly excellent. My favourites are Roadrunners, Via Negativa, Alone, and Medusa. Via Negativa and Medusa in particular showcase Robert Patricks talent and seriously mademe question why the character wasn't introduced earlier in the series. The mythology becomes increasingly complex, focussing on Scully's pregnancy and its connection to the coming invasion/colonisation of Earth. Most episodes do a good job of keeping the mythology interesting. Within/Without sets up the new situation well, with Per Manum and This Is Not Happening developing the arc further. TINH is a particularly good episode, with a haunting final scene. Vienen manages to link the mythology to older seasons in an entertaining way, and its also a treat for long-term fans. The season finale Essence/Existence doesn't really so much advance the plot as confuse it, but it is highly entertaining and very exciting. Also, Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is introduced in advance of her Season Nine co-star status.
Season Eight isn't quite perfect, but it demonstrates a show that doesn't rely on guest stars or ratings-tricks to enhance its reputation, just the quality of the show and its stars. A remarkable achievement.",1064966400,14,1878,5.2842809364548495
1874537,3,B00008YGRY,"Well, actually I don't know. I don't watch a lot of other TV.
For me, the infuriating thing about Seasons 8 and 9 is how close things came to working out, how nearly the X-Files came to transitioning from Mulder/Scully to Dogget/Reyes and perhaps keeping the franchise alive for another 7 years to the delight of fans, but it was not to be. What went wrong?
People have said that Mulder & Scully were so central to the X-Files, it couldn't survive without them. I don't actually believe this; I subscribe to the holistic view that it was a combination of the writing, acting, characters, production, and above all, subtelty and attention to detail. We could have lost Mulder & Scully, but with Skinner, The Lone Gunmen, CSM, Krycek, and so on, and with the same quality of writing as in seasons 4-6, the show could have gone on.
One problem was Dogget & Reyes' more extreme characters. Dogget is more of a knee-jerk skeptic, while Reyes is an unquestioning believer. One of the key reasons Mulder & Scully worked so well is that they worked in different shades rather than completely different attittudes. Mulder always bought into the science thing, and always tried to prove his theories to Scully in her scientific terms. Scully was willing to believe when the evidence was presented and the theory sound. Reyes and Dogget didn't have this common ground when first introduced and were much more two-dimensional.
It didn't then help that the rest of the elements slipped. The writing is far less sharp or consistant than previous years. The dialog and plotting lacks subtelty. The series lacks the wonder, the joy of the unknown that made previous years so appealing. They're still good at the scary stuff, but for me anyway the scary stuff was always just one piece of the puzzle.
What for me was disappointing was to look at the last few episodes of Season 9, when Dogget and Reyes finally start to gel, finally are starting to look like they might carry the show, the writing finally starting to tighten up again, and some of the subtelty is returning. Mulder and Scully are finally being left in the rear-view mirror and the show is getting on with it's life ... but too late.
A lot of little things went wrong this year for the X-Files, and it took too long for things to right themselves. It could have been done - if, for example, Scully had simply been sidelined instead of being put through the torturous (and, quite frankly, not particularly plausible) gyrations of Season 8, perhaps they could have had a clean slate and gotten back to where they needed to be (hey, I love Scully too, one of my favorite characters ... but sometimes you have to do things you don't want to). Perhaps if they had focussed more on Dogget and Reyes right away, bringing those characters more into focus, things would have been better.
But, it was not to be. Season 8 is still far from bad, but it isn't as good as any previous season, even Season 7 (which while it lacked consistancy, and had more klunkers than ever before, at least also had more stand-out episodes). I don't think it's even as good as the short-lived and lamented The Lone Gunmen, which had issues but was entertaining and I would have rather seen that show survive than the X-Files at that point. Season 8 still has some of the great visuals we've come to expect, but it's a transition season. If we knew that the X-Files was transitioning *to* somewhere, that would be OK, but we now know it retrospect that it's not, Season 9 is the end of the line.
So anyway. I'll be buying because I love the X-Files, and I'm a completist. That being said, I'm not thrilled about the money I'll have to spend, nor do I recommend this season with much enthusiasm. I think long-time X-Files fans will want this for their collection, but I doubt I'll be going back to watch these episodes as often as other seasons, as there are no true classics here to match ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"", ""Kill Switch"", ""Jose Chung"", ""Gethsemene"", ""Squeeze"", ""Die Hand der Verlitzt"", ""Three of a Kind"" and so on.",1064188800,25,4045,4.6194444444444445
1874578,4,B00008YGRY,"With the fate of The X-Files hanging in the balance up until the last show aired this was a great season. No one knew if the show would be coming back from a last season. A season to properly say goodbye. I think the 8th season was one of the best. It didn't have monotone David but a very excentric Robert Patrick. I loved the fact that they didn't let David run the show they picked up after he left and made some of the best episodes ever.

1874579,2,B00008YGRY,"This was the year the X-Files went soap opera. The melodrama only got worse in season 9, mind you, but it started here. With Mulder gone, all the now-pregnant Scully did was cry and mope. Plus, as talented as Robert Patrick was in his portrayal of Agent John Doggett, he and Scully did not have the rapport that she and Mulder had. The witty banter was gone. The dialogue that bounced between them only happened briefly, in the few episodes David Duchovny appeared in. And as wonderful as the final episode of the season was (that liplock between Mulder and Scully!) it was only the segue into the even more dismal season 9.
Maybe Chris Carter should have taken a clue from Duchovny and bowed out after Season 7. Of course, even with a lot lacking in this season, it ended beautifully. Then Carter had to go screw it up with Season 9.",1063324800,4,834,4.457516339869281
1874580,5,B00008YGRY,"In my opinion Season 7 should have been the last since we knew
both Anderson and Duchovny were ready to pursue other interests.
But Season 8 closed a lot of story line and developed new ones.
In Per Manum the question of who was the Father of Scully's baby
was finally answered.
The addition of Robert Patrick breathed life into the show creating another sceptic.
But the chemistry between Anderson and Patrick was not seen because in fans minds Mulder was Scully's heart therefore some did not give Patrick and Gish a chance.
The best episodes were the scary ones with Roadrunners,Via Negtiva,Vienen,and Essence and Existence.
The X-Files will go into history as being pop culture many shows are trying to duplicate it but to me there will be only one show.
 Again Anderson shows that she is a phenominal actress and she can hold her own no matter who they decide to put her with.
She was Agent Scully and any one else that plays her a candle will not be able to hold. I will get season 8 and 9 they'll be collectors.",1063065600,4,1018,4.5027027027027025
1874581,5,B00008YGRY,"By now, all X-Filers ought to be aware The X-Files was, and still is, the best television series yet produced.  For those in the majority, this awareness makes us the greatest life form to have walked the planet.  However, there are some among us -- those composed of more inferior stuff -- who disavow any allegiance to Seasons 8 & 9.  These are the inadequate, the woeful -- human-alien hybrids due for extinction.  And none to soon either.  A pox on thee.
Seasons 8 & 9 are the essential capstone of a tremendously potent Mythology.  A relentless Saga, it sank into our every pore like Black Oil on a mission.  And, as with all great mythologies, The X-Files outgrew its earthly bounds.  An entity beyond the ability of its Creators to control.  Therein brew the tragedy of its demise.
And the beauty of a its eternal life.  All Hail.
By Mythology, we speak of the story of Mulder & Scully in which these protagonists pitch an ongoing battle to uncover an alien takeover of Earth with all the conspiratorial acts attendant thereto.  Specifically, in Season 8, episodes -- 1 Within, 2 Without, 13 (shown 8th in order) Per Manum, 14 This is Not Happening, 15 DeadAlive, 16 Three Words, 18 Vienen, 20 Essence, 21 Existence.
The Creators tried to contain this Saga in Seasons 8 & 9 to prevent it from burning out like a fierce meteor piercing our late evening skies. To wit -- a continued reliance upon flagging bits of Genre to forestall a headlong rush into an Unknown even they had not foreseen.  Seasons 8 & 9 have their flaws, but the biggest may be the insistent putting forward of pieces of Genre in a vain attempt to buffer the insatiable demands of a Saga that had, by the end of Season 7, already mutated the original premise of The X-Files into a new specie with a life all its own.
Additives in Season 8 - the characters Doggett & Reyes - only increased the potency of an already achingly intense Mythology.  Robert Patrick & Annabeth Gish are superb in these roles.  However, backing them off their portrayals within the Saga to indulge in Genre proved rather senseless and probably contributed to the show's failure to build a popular base for their fine work.
It's not that the Genre pieces are poorly done, they seem quite good from a number of perspectives.  Albeit, a few would have been better never made.  Still, there should be no reason why lovers of the Genre cannot get their kicks from these episodes. The point is -- that compared to the Mythology, Genre's time had come and gone.
Everything about Doggett, the weightier character of the two, seemed designed to support the Mythology, yet he was constrained to battle ""phantoms"" of little matter repeatedly.  Reyes, on the other hand, came across a bit more ethereal and was created seemingly to boost the relevance of Genre within future plot lines, thereby allowing an increased mingling of it with the overhanging arc of the Saga.
As a result, the Creators found themselves engaged in suspect cross-cloning.  The Genre became even darker, moodier, so as not to be a disturbing departure from its dominant partner.  Lost were the lighter Mulder-Scully touches popular with X-Filers.  Information of greater import to the Mythology began to appear in Genre episodes within scenes outside the latter's main story lines.  All in an effort to retain some tie to the Saga.
This reviewer, for one, would have much preferred to witness tender and supportive Mulder-Scully moments -- such as when they were about to leave for their Lamaze class (#19 Alone) -- unfold within the pure context of the Mythology.  Likewise, their moments of reunion following Mulder's call back to life -- in particular a poignant gift giving scene (#17 Empedocies).  Having Scully tell Doggett why she became a believer in extreme possibilities -- although applicable to the Genre, but nonetheless the CRUX of the whole story, the BASIS for the saga in the first place -- would have carried more dramatic weight had it been observed within the purity of the Mythology.  It was, after all, the overarching epiphany of the series.
Heretofore, the Creators had been pretty successful at drawing a line between these main components -- character growth occurred within the Mythology, not Genre.  In truth, any two people could have been the principle players in Genre episodes.  Mythology, on the other hand, had specific emerging characters and a definite story arc filled with the kind of dramatic change and epiphany seldom, if ever, seen in one television series over a sustained period.
Instead we see the Genre, trapped within the irrepressible thrust of the Saga, struggling to remain relevant, while burdened with providing the Doggett character a venue in which to develop.  Better this latter should have occurred within the Mythology.
For many, such meddling and muddling bordered on a breach of faith.
That we must acknowledge the Creators were then, as now, mere mortals obligates us to keep all sharp objects away from their collective vital spot.  They did, after all, greatly entertain us.
Over nine seasons, the X-Files Creators not only exceeded Their wildest dreams, but even the wildest expectations of Us all.  Or, in the latter case, should have.
Not buy Seasons 8 & 9?  Fie, I say.
Think about this -- Somewhere out among us exists a Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.  And a divine hybrid they themselves have created named William.  And, more importantly, millions of us, who -- like Walter Skinner, John Doggett, & Monica Reyes -- would risk our own destruction to keep any and all of them hidden and safe if need be.
The Mythology gave us this insight, not the Genre.  We must recognize we've become legion.  We all are William.
The Mulder-Scully Saga is a beautifully told story, more powerful than its Creators to destroy.  And for that reason Seasons 8 & 9 deserve their place in our X-File collections.",1060819200,7,5871,4.807960199004975
1874582,4,B00008YGRY,"After a mediocre seventh season, season eight starts by following up one of the few highlights of the previous: Requiem. By introducing John Doggett the show feels like it's getting a breath of fresh air, but then, it is Chris Carter we are talking about, people, with him good things can only last so long.
PROS:
No bored-out Duchovny (like he was during the two previous years), a reinvigorated Gillian Anderson, Robert Patrick's John Doggett, most of the first half season episodes.
CONS:
That the show getting better was an illusion, as soon as Mulder returns (gasp! spoiler) things get weird. And before that no one really seems to care to look for him while he's missing. Writters had a mess with Scully's pregnancy timeline, etc. Oh, right and they kill what could have been the main villian of the show if handled correctly.
Bottom Line: Has good stand-alone episodes, and Within/Without are nice mythology installments. The rest are questionable, to say the least. It's a fan's must, anyway!",1059696000,3,1000,4.923076923076923
1874583,4,B00008YGRY,"A lot of people seemed to be dissatisfied with the 8th season. As much as some people don't like to admit The X-Files is a character show and the loss of Mulder for half of the season was big. However I think that Doggett added a lot to the show in his absence. Doggett had a big disadvantage of being disliked before he even was introduced, so he had to earn a lot more, because he was seen as replacing Mulder. But the thing is that he didn't try to replace him he tried to fill in some gaps until Mulder would return. I don't think that the actual cases suffered at all and the episodes were still wonderful. I LOVE the X-files and I really like seasons 8 and 9 as well. The eventual edition of Reyes worked well with the dynamic of the show. There needed to be another strong female character and she fit the bill, plus she had a history with Doggett.
The cases in season 8 are exciting, well writen, and fun to watch. I can't wait til it comes out, i'll have it pre-ordered ASAP.",1059523200,5,984,4.157068062827225
1874584,5,B00008YGRY,"Yeah, okay, I know this season doesn't have Mulder in it, I know Scully has become her complete opposite and I know most of the shows best writers had little or nothing to do with this season (Vince Gilligan, for example, scripted a total of ONE episoide this season), but the fact remains that this is still one of the best seasons, no matter what anyone says.
 I used to be one of the dedicated ""Mulder and Scully"" viewers, in fact, I didn't even want to watch this season first time round on T.V, but I eventually did watch it and was surprised to find that season 8 was actually quite a lot better than some of the M&S seasons before it.
 No offence to those who love the ""original"" X-Files, but, in all fairness, the show was getting a little wooden (hell, more than a little). We were no longer getting an hour of unique terror on the T.V every week; instead, we were getting pretty lame comedies (although I feel I should state that not ALL of them were lame), and ""paint-by-numbers"" X-Files, just more of the same.
 Robert Patrick's introduction gave new life to the show; we were back to the scary and the paranormal, and some of the best episoides of the X-Files ever were in Season 8 (""Redrum"" and ""Roadrunners"" are just two that spring to mind). Plus Dogget is an interesting carachter, he has his own motivations and opinions, he was not just a carbon copy of Mulder designed to stand in untill David Duchovny returned: he actually livened up the show by more than a little. And, I feel I can say this in all honesty (although it'll probably annoy some very small-minded and petty people out there) Robert Patrick is actually a better actor than David Duchovny.
 I'm not saying that Duchovny is a bad actor, far from it, just that Patrick had a much more difficult task, having to take over from Mulder without having all the fans go ..., and he pulled it off better than anyone else could have. Dogget is a great carachter and Patrick makes him really likeable and easy to identify with, a real triumph.
 In short, ignore all the bad reviews for this box-set (and, if you change the review rankings to ""lowest first"", you'll see there are indeed a lot) and beleive me when I say that Season 8 of the X-Files is a real triumph and worth the money; it certainly salvaged (for me at least) a show from which all originality had been bled out.",1056931200,11,2353,4.424942263279446

I ca'n to wait to up november in order thant to see in DVD! Why not FOX the 8 and 9 seasons release in this year?",1056153600,3,421,4.0843373493975905
1874586,1,B00008YGRY,"Well I guess that nothing as good as the X Files could stay good forever, but it didn't have to get this bad.
The X Files was supposed to end in season 7 when David Duchovny's contract ran out, but Chris Carter realised that he had no other T.V shows in him, so he decided to drag it on for as long as possible until it fizzled out and died a horribly slow and painful death, rather than having it go out with a bang like expected.
Season 8 lost all of the best X Files writers, leaving the new ones to base the show around a character who is no longer even in it. Without Mulder, this show couldn't last. Scully is a miserable and boring character, and ontop of that, someone had the bright idea of having her cry as much as possible throughout this season.
All season 8 did was complicate things to the point where we where simply watching a spoof version of the original X Files.
The acting in this season is depressing, the music sounds like cher on a bad day, the scripts appear to of been written on the back of a beer coaster and the direction took a wild spin out of control when the idea of making each episode look like a movie was decided upon.
It was overall about as much fun to watch as running a cheese grater over my face.
If your ever engaged to be married, and your partner leaves you at the alter, just tie them to a chair and make them sit though
season 8 of the X Files. You really can't get much worse than this. Except for season 9.
Anyway if you havn't figured it out yet, I am advising you to save your money and buy something else. Anything else.
However if you are rolling in money, and you would like to add to a collection, Red Rum is a good episode in season 8.
Otherwise, steer clear of this rushed, unthought and painfully boring season.
Don't take any notice of my giving this season 1 star, I simply couldn't send my review without giving it a rating first.

The eps rated with some interesting lines and concepts. From the Scully bounty hunter to the betrayal Scully felt when she thought Mulder had deceived her.
On retrospect season 8 wasn't bad considering the Mulderless situation. Within, Without, Patience, Roadrunners, This is not happening, Dead Alive, Essence & Existence are among my favorites.
My only complaint was the poor use of Mulder in the episodes he was in.

And after watching the first few episodes of S8, especially the season opener ""Without/Within"" and the brilliant ""RedruM"" my answer had to be a full-blown ""yes!"". Introducing a new agent, John Doggett, played by Robert Patrick was a brave decision, but a good one. Although the scripts sometimes lacked originality he and Gillian Anderson made the best of it and their acting and good chemistry often made me forget some minor writing flaws. The only point I need to criticize is the decision to bring in Monica Reyes, played by Annabeth Gish, very late and at the end of the season. Reyes turned out to be even more fascinating than Doggett and I would have loved to see more of her in S8.",1053129600,3,860,4.590909090909091
1874619,4,B00008YGRY,"Don't get me wrong i LOVE The X Files, but the departure of David Duchovny left a deeper scar than the people at Ten Thirteen wanted to admit.
Yes, Robert Patrick's character is an extremely intelligent addition to the series' universe... What the heck! Even Monica Reyes was a great character, but to introduce them on the eighth season was a bold move. Maybe the series should have ended on the seventh year. Maybe it should have ended on this one... Maybe...
There's nothing to regret now. The series actually ended about a year ago, and here we are hoping for the DVD sets to be released so we can have the complete 9 years the program lasted on its TV run.
Gillian Anderson carried the weight of the whole show in her shoulders, for the first time. And a lot of fans complain about the series turning into a Soap Opera, because of the amount of chapters in wich Scully cries; starting this season.
Maybe this fans are, most of them, men.
Don't get me wrong... i'm a guy too, but you have to understand all the events that happen to the Dana character during the short course of a year. She learns she's pregnant, even though she's been told before, she can never conceive... and she's lost the love of her life. I would cry too.
The show returns to the kind of episodes that were a predominance on the first season, in wich comedic episodes weren't still being produced. The creators were trying to give some heavy profile to the Doggett character, so they couldn't give him a comedic episode... even the circumstances in wich this season was developed, didn't allow it. The situations inside the series' psychology didn't help either.
The primary objective of our characters was to protect The X Files, find Mulder and get Scully's pregnancy to a good term.
The episodes in this season range from extremely good to extremely mediocre. Let's analyze them one by one in short phrases:
Within / Without: Being the first 2 episodes in the season, it was obvious they were going to be mithology ones... A mithology that started deepening from here.
Patience: Doggett's first X File. The first independent (or MOTW) episode. A lot of fans hated it. I didn't think it was THAT bad (at least not as FIGHT CLUB, written too by Chris Carter). Scully being a beleiver excited me beyond the realm of science. Doggett being an sceptic without reasons (differing from Scully's usual scepticism, supported by science)allowed the series to change in many ways.
Roadrunners: Vince Gilligan. Small town. Dark secret. And a Slug!!! One of the seasons' best!
Invocation: David Amann still amazes with this haunting tale!!!
Redrum: A Strange but rather effective episode. It's an X File even though Doggett and Scully don't even know they're involved in it. Joe Morton (T2) reunites with Robert Patrick.
Via Negativa (Wich translates from the spanish language as: ""Negative Way""): Ties with Badlaa as the strangest episode this season.
Surekill / Salvage: Worst episodes of the season. The only good joke is the self referential joke to T2.
Badlaa: Ties with Via Negativa as the strangest episode this season.
The Gift: Mulder has being keeping a secret to Scully. Found out what it is.
Medusa: A virus has been set free on the Boston Subway System.
Per Manum: Is Mulder the father of Scully's baby? Is Scully's baby an alien?
This Is Not Happenning / Dead Alive / Three Words: The three part arc that involves Mulder's return. The introduction of the Reyes character.
Empedocles: Reyes and Mulder try to solve the case of Doggett's son kidnapping and consequent murder.
Vienen (Wich translates from the spanish language as: ""They're Coming""): Mulder and Doggett together. Two worlds collide!!!
Alone: Mulder and Scully's last X File together, ever in the series!!!
Essence / Existence: For the first time a season finale is handled with a two parter!!! Mulder, Skinner, Doggett, Reyes and (Are you ready for this?) Krycek, protect Scully from Billy Miles and his legion of Super Soldiers. One of them DIES!!!
With this season handling a lot of mithology episodes to give a complete psychological profile to the Doggett character, this season cannot be considered the best nor the worse. Just an attempt from the creators to show they can still do good things lacking the original elements that made them famous.
Long Live Scully!!!
Long Live Mulder!!!
Long Live The X Files!!!

1874620,4,B00008YGRY,"Somebody needs to stick up for this season, and I think I'm the guy to do it:
When Duchovney left the show, Chris Carter went back to the drawing board and gave us a revitalized X-Files, one that surpassed the foundering seen in the seventh season.  While I believe Scully's pregnancy hampered things in some ways, Scully and Doggett really clicked.
It is an oversimplification to call Scully ""The Believer"" and Doggett ""The Skeptic"".  It would probably be more accurate to say that Doggett was a straightforward FBI guy--introducing themselves to the Boston Police: SCULLY: ""I'm a special agent with a medical background and expertise"" DOGGETT: ""I'm a good shot.""  Some of these episodes were the best on the show.  The cast change brought a real freshness to the episodes.
After the apocalyptic season 7, Doggett really grounds the series in its paranoid and subversive roots (ex: that monsters are real, but fall under ""plausible deniability""), without re-hashing old script plots and ideas.  Let's face it: after six years Scully's skeptisim was *really* wearing thin (how many times can one person get kidnapped by aliens before they begin to think that maybe the aliens exist?)  Compare this season with Season 2 and you'll see what I mean.
While Mulder's character, the search for his sister, and his fight against ""The consortium"" may have been the driving force behind the show, there was no reason the story couldn't continue.  Especially since most of those stories were wrapped up in Seasons 5-7.  While  Scully had her own passions and ambitions, and the antoginists still existed.  There is a natural flow to the idea of Mulder disappearing and Scully carrying on the X-Files torch in her own way.
And while Reyes was a character who I found to be pretty annoying, she *did* add a lot to the show.  She would have done better, though, if the writers could have fleshed her ""feelings"" out a little bit more so that she wasn't ""feeling"" her way right through investigations to the smoknig guns a la Counseller Troi.
In my mind, this season (and a few episodes from Season 9) make up ""The X-Files: The Next Generation"".  Had Chris Carter not been under so much pressure from Fox and the fan base, it is likely that this show would be still be on the air today (and would probably be better than half the stuff out there now).  But the uncertainty of the shows future combined with what seems to be impaitence from the suits really weighed down the X-Files.  Season 9 became the ""Wrap It Up And Get Us Out Of Here"" season with some truly awful episodes.
If you didn't stop at Season Six, don't stop now.",1051488000,12,2613,4.726872246696035
1874621,5,B00008YGRY,"This season totally changed a tired concept of a long running show. It added new characters and opened so many new doors to the future of the show.
Gillian Anderson portrays a pregnant and emotional Scully, perfectly. Shes vulnerable and missing Mulder. We are introduced to John Doggett played by Robert Patrick whose on full time, whilst Monica Reyes played by Annabeth Gish is introduced half way as a part time character.
This season returns to the horror roots, much like season one, which was much needed at this point. It has some of my all time favourite episodes such as Roadrunners, Per Manum, This is Not Happening and Existence.
People complain that Mulder and Scully didn't get enough time together in this season, Mulder had cameos and needed to be centric, his abduction experiences and Scully's pregnancy wasn't discussed enough and the writers didn't make enough effort to show that Scully was still searching for Mulder in the stand alone episodes, i totally agree, but it didn't stop me enjoying this season completely which i hadn't done since season four.
Its the most underrated season and should have definately ended the show with a fantastic episode and closing scene. It shouldnt have continued into an unecessery season nine which pushed the show and the two leads too far, they simply had lost interest, along with the fans.
Watch this season with an open mind, ignore what disappointed fans say and see for yourself. It isn't the same without classic stand alone invesitgations by mulder and scully, but Doggett is definately a character that grows on you, working well with Gillian Anderson. You will be blown away by her acting this season.
Fans fail to understand that this season beats season seven hands down. Its definately a suprise how well the x files can work without david duchovny. His absence is very well explained this season, unlike the plain awful way he's written out in season nine.
Dont have high hopes for season nine after watching this classic season, it doesnt justify the show at all. What a shame it didn't end here.",1051142400,32,2071,4.8696883852691215
1874622,3,B00008YGRY,"Before the first episode of Season 8 appeared, I was one of the people who wasn't going to watch the show without David Duchovny. Heck, by that time I wasn't watching it *with* him--I thought Season 7 was terrible and had given up on the show long before the season finale. But magazine articles about the changes planned for Season 8 persuaded me to give Doggett one episode to win me over--he had me by the end of his first scene.
In my personal opinion, Duchovny's decision to leave saved the season and I laud him for having the guts to do so despite criticism. It forced the writers and producers to try something dramatically new--a new main character--with a concept that was increasingly tired. And Doggett was a perfect addition to the show: his old-fashioned sense of chivalry and ""I'll believe it when I see it"" attitude were not only intriguing, but made him suitably distinct from both Mulder and Scully as characters. Not to mention Robert Patrick got a real chance to show off his acting range in this role so different from the one that made him famous.
Mulder's absence also freed Scully from feeling that she *had* to cling to her skepticism in order to ground him, and let her finally grow into the belief she should have had years ago. One of the weaknesses of the series to that point was that lack of natural character growth--Mulder and Scully were pretty much the same people in Season 7 as they were in Season 1.
Drawbacks include the season-long pregnancy arc, which not only strained credibility (Mulder supposed disappeared in May yet Scully gave birth the following May and didn't show until well into the sixth or seventh month of that thirteen-month pregnancy? No wonder she thought the kid must be an alien.) but felt pretty much like a cheap ratings stunt to keep the attention of viewers who were daunted by Duchovny's absence and the resulting absence of the ""MSR."" This was confirmed for me by the fact that they used another lame plot device to get rid of the kid the following season so he wouldn't hamper his parents' future adventuring ability. *sigh*
Was Season 8 comparable with the series at its peak? No. And it wasn't enough to really *save* the show, as shown by its deterioration again in Season 9 despite Robert, Annabeth and the producers' best efforts--perhaps if Doggett and Reyes had been introduced in Season 6 instead? But it was remarkable because it gave new life to a show that was years overdue for cancellation. If I had to rank the seasons in order of quality, it would be 4, 5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, 9, 7.
The best episodes of the season, IMO (in no particular order), are ""Via Negativa,"" ""Three Words,"" ""DeadAlive,"" ""Within""/""Without,"" ""Medusa,"" ""Alone,"" and ""Vienen."" A few, like ""Surekill"" and ""Salvage"" (except for a cute T2 in-joke or two) were just plain bad, but the rest were on the better side of the median, even if not the best of the series.",1051056000,8,2907,4.624758220502901
1874623,2,B00008YGRY,"Can anyone smell some shark jumpage? Robert Patrick isn't bad, in any other show he would be a likeable character, but I barely watched this season. Some episodes are decent enough from a writing point of view (and ""Via Negativa"" is the scariest ep I've ever seen). But nothing can get past the fact that it's all contrived and stretched waaaay beyond its limit. If they'd ended it on ""Requiem"" from season 7, with Mulder's and Scully's secret dreams come true, it would have gone down with dignity. Instead they had to drag it on when it had run out of juice. Once he left it became even more apparent that Mulder (together w/ Scully) is the heart of the show.
And about the movie....I have my doubts...if it was just a standalone set somewhere between seasons 1-6 it might work..",1050278400,8,781,4.546099290780142
1874624,2,B00008YGRY,"To be honest with you all, I hardly watched the show after I heard that Duchovny was leaving.  The episodes don't hold up without the Mulder & Scully interaction.  I did not believe the ""I want to believe"" Scully.  Doggett was okay.  I still keep thinking he is looking for Schwartzeneger.  Reyes was annoying.  Her dialogue was insipid (""I just have a feeling.""  Didn't Mulder at least give reasons for his ""feelings?"").  Once Mulder did come back, he was not the same Mulder.  I always found Mulder to be sweet, innocent, and sensitive.  He came back with a definite attitude change.  Did the writers purposely write Mulder that way for fans to like Doggett and forget about Mulder?  What's up with this Super Soldiers concept (or was that in the next season?)?  I also thought I heard rumors of the writers wanting to develop a love interest between Doggett & Reyes, Doggett & Scully, or Reyes & Scully.  Scully a lesbian--that would explain alot.  As you can tell, I have big problems with this season.
The pros (very few):
(1) Existence.  I would have bet big money that that episode was going to end WHILE Scully was giving birth (X-Files loves writing those cliffhangers!).  I would have LOST.  The episode ended with everything pretty well wrapped up.  The series could have ended here (and we would have avoided viewing the utterly horrible POS they call the ninth season).  The episode is filled with Christmas symbolism: Scully & Monica finding an abandoned home with painted glass window, Mulder following a light to find Scully, the Lone Gunman bearing gifts, etc.  One character dies (should have died in the ninth season).  The writers, earlier in the season, tried to make William's conception a mystery.  In this episode, the writers seemed like they gave up the pretense and finally acknowledged the obvious.  Very sweet ending.
(2) Deadalive.  Mulder is alive...again.  To enjoy this episode, one must ignore logic.  How can a man who was autopsied, had blood drained from his body, and buried be up and alive again?  Anyway, I did like this episode.  Mulder and Scully have an interestingly odd conversation when they get to his apartment.  Mulder meets Doggett.
(3) Per Manum.  Odd episode.  Scully finds out about her ova but is surprised even though she knew about it in season five.  Scully asks Mulder to be the father of her child, and we are supposed to believe that they are just friends/co-workers?  Episode was set sometime in Season 7.  Very sweet scenes in this episode, though.
Mediocre:
All other eps with Mulder in them.
Cons:
All eps without Mulder in them.
This season would appeal more to the new x-files fan, not the fans who watched since the show's debut.  There are alot of Doggett & Reyes fans out there, for some reason.  If only those fans watched before now, before the show turned into a soap opera, they would know what high quality show the X-Files was.  Buy any set from Seasons 1 through 6.",1049500800,7,2941,4.739130434782608
1874625,4,B00008YGRY,"You see, David Duchovny's absensce was not intended by Then Thirteen. Agent John Dogget was created out of necessity. Things were difficult even when Duchovny was around, with terrible episodes such as ""Je Souhaite"", ""Theef"", ""Alpha"" and many others. Mst of all, ""The X-Files"" had become, well, too funny. Too many jokes. The eighth season at least had to stop that, to center on the development of a new charachter and on the new side of Scully, wanting to believe but being betrayed by her emotions.
It's not that the part of John Dogget was well written. It was good enough. It's in Robert Patrick's acting that this character grew so much. He was to Scully what she always needed Mulder to be, but he wasn't Mulder. He could only watch her heart and her soul breaking. And Patrick showed through his eyes that it was hard to just watch it.
Great chemistry between Patrick and the rest of the cast, specially Mitch Pillegi. It seemed as if Skinner saw much of himself in Dogget. And when Mulder finally came back, the confrontations between him and Dogget were pure gold. I was very pleased with season 8 (episodes ""Roadrunners"", ""Via Negativa"", ""The Gift"", ""Empedocles"", ""Vienen"" and ""Alone""), except for the mithology episodes, which changed everything the show was about.
So I guess you should really buy this set if you are a fan, but the earlier seasons (the golden Vancouver years) may please you more if you're not hooked yet. But have in mind that if you go after them, you'll end up right here, buying the 8th season.",1049241600,4,1529,4.687732342007435
