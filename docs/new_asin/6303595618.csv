7851296,2,6303595618,"Against all odds, the ""Prehysteria"" series were some of the more genuinely popular movies in the video store that weren't released by Disney, and are certainly the commercial centerpiece of Moonbeam Entertainment's three-year run. Disappointingly, they're also inconsistent when it comes to their quality, with the third installment here losing the edge that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-second/dp/6303220339/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the second</a>&nbsp;had gained over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-original/dp/6302768047/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the original</a>. ""Prehysteria 3"" is a tolerable family outing for younger kids and folks who value nostalgia, but as a viewer approaching it for the first time to complete the trilogy, it's far from great.

The story: apparently taking place immediately after the last adventure, the quintet of pygmy dinosaurs escape their ride home and find themselves on a defunct miniature golf course, where a young girl (Whitney Anderson, who'd grow up to do&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie-Strippers/dp/B001DSNEKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie Strippers</a>) is trying to protect the property of her father (Fred Willard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>) from the scheme of her unscrupulous uncle (Bruce Weitz,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hill-Street-Blues/dp/B000BOH8YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hill Street Blues</a>).

The movie is a product of longtime low-budget horror & sleaze chef David DeCoteau (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master-III-Toulon-s-Revenge/dp/B003YCL0TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge</a>), who I'm pretty sure was signed to direct only with the promise of doing a dinosaur movie, unaware that it would be a family film, because he really doesn't show any kind of flair or enthusiasm. Any cleverness or style that the last two films may have had are slowly drained from this one as it panders to the lowest common denominator whenever it can: dumb gags are further weighed down by stupid sound effects and forced setups (e.g. the ""heat master"" scene), and in the absence of these we have outright laziness in the form of food-throwing and unfunny pratfalls. The villains are overzealous rich snobs who will definitely get on your nerves but otherwise had me wishing for the comparatively brilliant antagonism of the creepy curator and overbearing housekeeper from the last two films.

This is definitely a personal low for the dinosaurs, whose novelty has run thin both in the story and out of it. Human characters show astonishingly little surprise at their presence, to the point that the dinosaurs can hang out in plain sight on the golf course (I shouldn't complain, since this is one of the few times the dinoes are featured in the same shot as the people interacting with them). Worse yet, they're not very active at all, mostly just eating food, standing around, and occasionally biting someone or redirecting a golf ball. Up close, the at least a couple of them have started looking remarkably fake. With that said, the human cast isn't all bad: while most players are notable only for how hammy of a performance they give, Whitney Anderson has great enthusiasm. I like the angle of her character wanting to retain her Scottish heritage by wearing kilts and speaking with an accent; it's kind of cute. Additionally, there is some fun to be had by how over-the-top the antics are: the movie treats golf with the same maniacal importance as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;treated martial arts, and it leads to some memorable buffoonery like the swordfight with golf clubs.

As overall disappointing as this one was, it's kind of a shame that the series had to end with Moonbeam Entertainment's existence. I can only figure that the studio just wasn't cutting the mustard anymore and couldn't produce, as indicated by the fact that this is the only one of the three films to not feature behind-the-scenes features at the end of the tape. I wish the dinoes could've gone out with a bit more style, but oh well - fans will still enjoy this one, but newcomers should watch the other two first.",1348358400,,4586,6.321086261980831
7851297,5,6303595618,"I personally, happen to be a fan of all 3 Prehysteria films, and out of all of them, this one happens to be my favorite in the series. This one had a more known cast too.

The movie is about a young girl named Ella (Played by Whitney Anderson), whose father, Thomas (Played by Fred Willard, who has been in just about everything) is on the verge of bankruptcy, thanks to his brother, Hal (Played by Bruce Weitz from ""Hill Street Blues."") See, Thomas owns a putt-putt course, which happens to be in competition with Hal's Golf Course, which he owns. It's then that Ella finds everyone's favorite mini-dinosaurs, things start to change for the better.

I really don't feel like giving anything away, so I'm ending it here. Oh, and be on the lookout for a cameo by horror fave Bill Moseley as the director of Hal's commercial.

Highly recommended.",1176422400,,844,4.576158940397351
