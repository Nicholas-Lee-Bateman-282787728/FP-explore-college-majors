8207009,2,B000SUQUG0,"I recently purchased this item for $3.99, thinking I would be getting professionally published DVDs in the pictured case, probably a remainder item. Forget that. For $3.99 you get two home-burned, hand-labeled DVDs shipped in a manila envelope. No case, no list of contents. On the plus side, you get over 200 hours of radio programs with decent quality sound (64 kbps, mono). But you can download these radio programs for free on the Internet.",1281052800,,444,4.933333333333334
8207010,2,B000SUQUG0,"This DVD was exactly what I wanted as far as the material on it goes.  However, it is formatted to be played on the computer.  It says that it can be copied and put on to a CD, where it can be listened to on a CD player.  Trying to figure out how to do that has been beyond my capabilities.  If I wish to listen to it, I need to be at the computer.",1243123200,5,348,3.6
