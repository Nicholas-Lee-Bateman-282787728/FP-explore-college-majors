8422387,4,B004BV7FES,At last a film that delivers as expected-fast paced totally unpredictable and gripping throughout. Even in the last minutes few would guess the final twists and one is left asking why other films cannot take a copy of the way this is plotted. As the Director also directed Phone Booth I knew this had to be really good. It was. Great acting by all the characters.,1431820800,,363,4.515151515151516
8422388,3,B004BV7FES,It's a decent watch if you are a fan of movies like Scream. The twist at the end is good but you could probably see it coming. I felt the protagonist really hammed it as far as his acting was concerned. A one time watch at best.,1376956800,,228,3.872340425531915
8422389,2,B004BV7FES,"Matthew Lillard (""Scream"") plays Joel Brandt, a struggling screenwriter teaching at a college. One day someone leaves a strange message on his telephone, asking him to help immediately or he will be killed. Joel thinks it is a prank call and deletes it. Later, at a caf his ex-girlfriend Claire (Chiara Zanni) works, Joel learns that he should have taken the deleted message seriously. A man falls from the building right in front of him - the very man who made a call a few hours before.

""Message Deleted"" is written by a veteran writer Larry Cohen, whose recent works include ""Phone Booth"" and ""Cellular."" They may not be exactly the greatest thriller in the world, but the fast-paced thrillers are still very entertaining roller coaster rides, keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats.

Unfortunately the story of ""Messages Deleted"" unfolds so slowly that we lose interest before it reaches the 30 minute mark. In the second half the film gets silly with Deborah Kara Unger's detective, who just does not even try to check the phone records at the telephone company.

After all, ""Message Deleted"" suffers what the film's protagonist tells his students not to do in writing a thriller in his class. I know the point the film is trying to make with its self-referential dialogue, but without the pace, wit and storytelling of more skilled director (like Wes Craven), the film only becomes tedious and boring.",1336262400,2,1416,4.867219917012448
8422390,4,B004BV7FES,"Veteran screenwriter Larry Cohen (It's Alive, Best Seller, Maniac Cop, Phone Booth, Cellular, etc.) wrote this mystery thriller about screenwriter/screenwriting teacher Joel Brandt, who finds himself at the center of a series of seemingly senseless killings, that seem to be related to his screenplay, ""Senseless Killings"". Like our hero, sorry protagonist, Cohen knows how to structure a story, and ""Messages Deleted"" pretty much follows the standard formula of mystery thrillers. It's well crafted, no better or worse than many other films like it. It's entertaining and certainly not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. Recommended to fans of mysteries, and especially those who are also interested in screenwriting. 3+/4-",1322611200,2,720,5.554545454545455
8422391,2,B004BV7FES,"This film is about a script writer who is teaching at a university. He rambles on and on about cliche in movies, and yet this movie is completely guilty of them too. The movie is too predictable by the end. It may not have the 'girl runs upstairs, instead of outside to safety' thing, but it does have the typical 'guess which of our 5 characters introduced during the whole movie done it?' so it has failed to try and be smart.

So the main character finds himself receiving phone calls and receives messages on his machine from random people, begging for his help, as some psycho has a gun to the heads of the victims... which leads to him being the #1 suspect, and he has to try and figure it all out to prove his innocence. The plot is far from original, but watchable, and as I said, predictable, so once you see the ending, you will probably think to yourself that you saw that coming a mile away. I highly doubt you will have no intention to ever see it again.

A rental, or d/l at most, but not worth purchasing.",1290988800,6,1020,4.252577319587629
