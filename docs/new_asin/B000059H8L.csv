7933191,3,B000059H8L,"Herschell Gordon Lewis was a one-time professor of English literature, specialist in direct-mail advertising, and movie mogul of some of the cheapest and cheesiest movies ever to show at rural U.S. drive-ins, venues where the movie is the least reason to go there.  Something Weird Video has paired two of Lewis's late-sixties youth-gone-wild epics, each made for about as much money as you would spend on an outhouse, and fittingly so.

  ""Blast Off Girls"" (1967), made in Chicago, is the superior film, although that's not saying a lot.  It's a moralistic fable about a sleazy and unscrupulous young rock band manager called Boojie Baker, yes Boojie not Boogie.  He signs up a band he dubs ""The Big Blast,"" and proceeds to promote them using seven loose young trollops, called the ""Blast Off Girls,"" to grease the way.  The girls drape themselves all over concert promoters and record producers, and soon the Big Blast's single ""Noise"" is climbing the charts.  But Boojie is a slickster who makes sure he gets most of the profits.  When the boys, who are pleasant-looking but no movie stars, rebel, Boojie sets up a phony pot bust to force them to sign a new slave-wage contract.  The clean-cut looking boys give in, but plot their vengeance on base and bad Boojie.  The cheap production can remind you of an extended home-movie skit, with variable photography and very thin sound.  Dan Conway as Boojie is one of the few professional-quality actors in the film, and The Big Blast is played by a long-forgotten Chicago band called The Faded Blue, whose songs are distinctly 1967-sounding.  Col. Harlan Sanders, who catered the production, appears as himself, pushing buckets of that greasy ""Finger Lickin' Good"" chicken.  Take away the sex and pot angles, and the movie is about as tame as an episode of ""The Monkees.""  Truthfully, it's not too bad a movie, and actually funny once in a while.  Also it reminds me of Chicago circa 1967, a great time to be young.

""Just For the Hell of It"" (1968), made in sunny Florida, is the cruel saga of the destruction gang, a bunch of nondescript teen boys and a girl who go around doing rotten things and hurting innocent people.  Every time we see these anti-social outrages, we vaguely hear a really thin-sounding rock song called ""De-STRUC-TION!""  The gang's antics start out just plain stupid, like throwing paint on people and wrecking bicycles, get nastier, like assaulting a blind man, a guy on crutches, and putting a baby in a trash can, and descend to rape and murder.  The punks make an enemy in Doug, an old acquaintance of one of them, and his girl Jeanne.  Like Billy Jack, blond Doug is the one stalwart with the guts to stand up to the gang.  One punk jabs Doug in the chest with a broken bottle, but the bleeding hero still beats up the cowardly reprobate.  The gang plot to get a very personal revenge on Doug.  Most of the movie's attempts to shock and offend are made laughable by the desperately amateurish acting and presentation, but when Lewis has an opportunity to show the body of a girl who has been raped and murdered, he goes for tasteless and lingering close-ups.  Film climaxes with a very phony-looking motorcycle crash and two killed, and is capped off by a punk shrugging his shoulders and muttering, ""Who cares?""  ""Just For the Hell of It"" is a bottom-of-the-barrel piece of trash that would be more offensive if it were a remotely professional movie.  Even so, you have to admit Lewis was able to grind out many little flicks with the very humblest of budgets, actors, and resources, and he made money.  I am sure he did not care about anything else.  Something Weird has included many H.G. Lewis trailers and a host of goofy drive-in extras.",1519689600,,3721,4.725581395348837
7933192,5,B000059H8L,"I purchased this disc for the H. G. Lewis epic ""Just for the Hell of It,"" but found that that was actually the inferior picture.  The real gem here, the real classic, is ""Blast-Off Girls,"" the review for which follows:

H. G. Lewis occupies a special place in film history; he's infamous because his blood-red gore films of the 60's and 70's were so shocking and audacious. I've enjoyed watching a few of his movies, but I have certainly not seen them all.

Nevertheless, I'd be willing to bet that ""Blast-Off Girls"" is one of his best-made films. I liked it a lot. Surprisingly, it features no graphic violence, and very little violence period. And surprisingly, it is driven by story and acting, both of which are fine considering the shoestring budget. I imagine there is a strong autobiographical side to this movie, because filmmaker Lewis really seems to loathe and despise the rotten, profit-grubbing main character:

Dan Conway plays ""Boojie Baker,"" the all-too-believably sleazy band manager with big-time aspirations--he's working his way up the ladder (or so he thinks), chewing up and spitting out small rock bands; he entices his prospects with girls, and promises of ""the good life,"" then books shows for them--but when the minimal profits roll in, he makes sure the band gets just enough of them to stick begrudgingly around. If they question his honesty, he lies and placates; if they accuse him of thievery and threaten to leave, he blackmails them. He's thoroughly detestable, and very enjoyably played by Conway.

Boojie's associates generally only tolerate him so they can go to his raucous parties (attended by the ""Blast-Off"" groupie girls of the title, who have basically nothing to do with the story). He doesn't really have any friends, and seems happy without them.

But Boojie's good luck runs out the day he takes on a musical group that is as naive as all the others, but possessing of a strong sense of justice. They object to his treatment of them, and plan an elaborate revenge, with the intent of screwing Boojie on a cosmic level. In classic morality-play fashion, Boojie gets his rightful desserts, although he does spin off at the end of the film (rather like Darth Vader at the end of ""Star Wars""), minus one cheesy band but ready for new sleazy Boojie adventures. Don't kid yourself, the film seems to say; you might be lucky enough to send them off in some other direction, but Boojies don't go down easy!

In a twisted way, this is a charmingly optimistic film that suggests that decent people can exist in the entertainment world if they have the guts to stand their ground and oppose their oppressors. But ""Blast-Off Girls"" isn't really about the good guys at all; it is almost a study in Boojie-ness, a virtual diagram of the Boojies of the world, so that the viewer will be able to spot them should he or she have the misfortune to get into business relationships with them. The bands Boojie abuses wander in and out of the movie; but Boojie himself is ever-present--the sneering, evil star of this odd and fascinating picture. See it today!",1342828800,6,3085,4.787593984962406
7933193,4,B000059H8L,"Just for the Hell of it was, and even now it's name screams, 'Grind house' (before that term became vogue). It was recently featured at the Grindhouse Film Festival at Tarrantino's beautifully renovated New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles (thanks for saving history Q). As many know a novel by Burgess was said to have been altered a bit for CWO after Kubrick saw JFTHOT in NYC. It's one of HGL's films where someone, generally a defenseless, sobbing and franticly screaming woman, is NOT hacked up alive, eaten and then laughed at...probably because he did not write it. This film would not be on Dahmers, Manson's or Gacy's entertainment shelf.

After watching a 'godfather of garbage' production I understand one feels sickened, disturbed and mentally abused....is it because of the content or is that the normal state of someone who would watch that specific genre of his?  His repertoire includes exploitation, hixploitation, sexploitation and destuctploition and to NOT see a Lewis movie that does NOT have the usual Lewis aforementioned gore scenes is  NOT seeing the complete man. Lewis has won the right to have all his work seen. It's impossible to cubbyhole Herschell Gordon Lewis..

Just for the Hell of It is a typical low budget 'indie' (long before that term became vogue) production of an interesting view of non-stop criminal havoc and gang mentality, initiated by an inept 'leader' Dexter (Sager/ Slash Cut w/ Sasha Grey), carried out after being twisted into truly demented evil by Denny (White/ Capitol Records, Forever is a Dream) on everyone in south Florida and specifically Doug (Bedell/??) and Jeanne (Gynes/??), with the assistance of perky bad girl Bitsy (Nobel/ She Devils on Wheels). White, the 'most vicious of the gang' dies like a real bad boy should, in a Motorcycle accident after a  chase scene that needed more than $32.50 on production and editing, after all however,  it was going directly to Drive-ins.
Lou Ferrigno had started a fight with White about who was Denny Fortune in the film, him or White (DUHHH). In his own inimitable fashion, in the middle of Sunset Blvd, Johnny Legend tries to get to the truth and calm things down in Sleazemania on Parade w/Gene Autry, Steve Allen, Angie Dickenson and
Mr T.

Just for the Hell of it has been teamed up on a SWV DVD with Blast-off Girls. Together again, Sager did what all boys from Chicago do....BAD and White wrote and performed Bad Day, the opening tune.

Considering other movies Lewis has done, the story lines and poor performances of today's films, I am thinking this is worth the 10 bucks.",1296777600,,2585,4.885844748858448
7933194,4,B000059H8L,"Wow...

These movies aint great, but if you like laughing at weird stuff, look no further. The production values are terrible, but the films are somehow awesome in their hilariousness (that's right ""hilariousness""). I'd give them 4 stars because they are entertaining but I just cant. Wait a minute, yes I can.

***changes stars to 4***

Yep 4 stars. Maybe a star more than these two turkeys deserve, but who's counting right?

What else can I say?... Well, I guess you really don't need recreational drugs with movies like this around. You'll loes brain-cells aplenty watching this inane nonsense. I'd sum up the plots or major details in these movies, but why bother. Other reviews have done that already (wait... have they?) Oh well. I guess if you have some extra money layin' around and you want to see two truly bizarre flicks with some truly hilarious moments, buy this disc.

The real-deal Col. Sanders is in one of them, I swear...",1269302400,3,940,4.777777777777778
7933195,4,B000059H8L,"Blast Off Girls, despite the title, didn't have too much to do with girls. Instead, this film showcases a male rock band, trying to hit the big time in the music biz, during the late-60s. The band goes through quite a bit, as they struggle to become well-known pop stars. They have to contend with a ruthless, greedy manager, internal squabbles amongst the band members, living on a meager income, their own drug abuse etc., etc.

Though this movie is not the most exciting rock film in the world, it's entertaining in a hokey sort of way. The band plays some pretty decent garage/psychedelic rock, and they give-off an energetic vibe. There are many scenes in this film, that show the band frolicking merrily outdoors. In this way, the movie is similar to an episode of the Monkees. For those who are nostalgic about the late-60s rock scene, this movie will suffice.",1261872000,3,867,4.703947368421052
7933196,5,B000059H8L,"(note: the below review is strictly for 'Just For The Hell Of It')

H.G. Lewis was on quite a roll in the late 60's... In fact, he directed
11 films (!) in '67 and '68. I realize that Lewis has his share of
detractors. Many consider him a no talent hack who relentlessly
regurgitated disposable entertainment at a disturbingly prodigious rate
during the mid-to-late 60's. They often bemoan the nailed-down camera
work, wooden acting, and ridiculous situations depicted on screen.
Interestingly, these are the exact elements that make Mr. Lewis's films
so endearing to me...

When I watch movies, I do so for two main reasons. Either I want to be
entertained and amused; or I want be pulled out of my comfort zone, and
placed in a mental area in which I am forced to think about and ponder
various facets of life. This film entertains in a big way. In fact,
most H.G. Lewis films never fail to entertain me and bring a big smile
to my face...

Mr. Lewis is best know as being the Godfather of Gore. Not many
film-goers realize that Mr. Lewis was an incredibly versatile movie
making machine; dipping into children's films, morality tales,
hillbilly musical comedies, juvenile delinquent tales, nudies,
roughies, and other assorted ephemera...

'Just For The Hell Of It' is H.G. Lewis's juvenile delinquent
masterpiece. These are some bad kids...

The film starts out with a bang, and within 45 seconds a reckless
groups of youths can be found laying waste to and completely trashing a
house. These bad boys (and girl) are led by Ray Sager(as Dexter). The
entire film is dedicated to the exploits of Dexter and company, as they
terrorize a town and it's inhabitants. The pranks and mischief start
out relatively harmlessly (setting newspapers on fire, dousing citizens
with water, destroying laundry, trashing a restaurant), become more
bizarre and off-color (putting a baby in a trash can, beating a blind
man with his own cane), and of course become very malicious (gang rape
and murder)...

I really enjoyed this film quite a bit. With subsequent viewings, it
has never ceased to put a smile on my face. I also liked that Mr. Lewis
didn't try to justify or explain the actions of the rowdy youth- they
did it all 'Just For The Hell Of It'.... they did it for the kicks...
In fact, You should watch this highly entertaining piece of nostalgia
for the same reason...",1170201600,9,2365,4.7560975609756095
7933197,2,B000059H8L,"The first thing you need to know is that you had better have a full stomach when you press ""Let's Go to the Drive-in!"" and start this DVD double-feature from the gang at Something Weird, because you are going to be assaulted with several minutes of drive in ads for the concession stand.  It is hard to sit there during the countdown to show time when it clearly ""time to stretch and fetch.""  Then we get trailers for the first feature, ""Just for the Hell Of It"" along with ""Suburban Roulette"" (""Russian Roulette played for flesh""), ""The Gore Gore Girls"" (scenes too brutal to be seen so they pour blood on the title cards), ""The Psychic"" (he could have used his power to better the world but guess what he used it to do instead), and the label's flagship film ""Something Weird"" (""where love and violence have the same meaning"").  One thing for these trailers, they really do set you up to want to watch some exploitation cinema.  The bad news is that both of the feature films are from director Herschell Gordon Lewis, and they make the intermission material the best bits on this DVD.

Then we are suddenly into the first movie as a group of laughing teenagers destroy the room in which they are having a party.  Just when you are wondering what is going on the title ""Just for the Hell Of It"" appears and you have both the theme and the motivation for this 1968 film.  These wacky kids like bad rock music as long as it is played with great enthusiasm.  You can tell they are a gang because one guy has a switchblade.  Dexter (Ray Sager), the leader of the gang has nice things to say about Doug (Rodney Bedell), even though the guy is a bit of a square.  But that does not mean that the gang will not go around town terrorizing the citizens (try to read a newspaper and then light it on fire).  Of course, the cops cannot do anything and these  ""damn kids"" are mostly doing things that junior high students would consider juvenile or at least stupid and silly (tear up a magazine someone is reading).  But the idea is apparently this gang can walk around town and do whatever they want: they just cannot come up with anything intelligent crimes to commit.

Meanwhile, Doug has a new girl Jeannie (Agi Gyenes) and has to fight one of the young thugs.  Then we get another set destroyed by the gang.  Eventually they talk four young girls into coming to another party where they decide to strip the girls and leave them in the country wearing towels.  Then they break up a baseball game a bunch of kids are playing, which is where Doug comes back into the story and stats the obvious, that these guys are pretty lame always picking on kids and anyone weaker than they are.  At this point things really derail because the cops get involved and make things worse.  No wonder the whole thing makes Jeannie sick, especially when we get to the wimpiest pool game in the history of juvenile delinquency.  These guys are real idiots.  They find a couple on a beach, they knock him out, tear off her bikini top and then, finding an ax on the beach, they destroy a rowboat.  Ah, the insanity of it all, especially when they keep playing the theme song of the movie in an effort to get their money's worth.  So when things finally do turn ugly, it just seems so tacky, as does the ending (assuming it really is the ending and there is not film missing).

Then we are promised the birth of babies (if you feel like you are going to pass out send somebody out to the snack bar to provide you with aid) but instead we get a lecture on ""sexual ignorance"" (usually the fault of the man) by some guy who was on the ""Tonight Show"" and who also knows about juvenile delinquency.  But tonight he is talking just about sex and you had better be prepared for a frank discussion of this topic even if it is couched in slightly outdated vocabulary because this is the highlight of this DVD.  If you want to get either ""Knowledge for Men"" or ""Knowledge for Women"" (or both) in the privacy of your own car, just turn your parking lights on.  Then there is a Peter Max inspired Pepsi ad for Refreshment time and a bunch more of those tantalizing food ads and assorted bits before the second feature.

Finally, before the second feature there is a short featuring Linda and Michelle go-go dancing with much enthusiasm and trailers for more films by Lewis.  There is the next feature, ""Blast-off Girls, then ""This Stuff'll Kill You,"" a movie about a crazy man of the cloth which seems to be going out of its way to insult the citizens of the Bible Belt, then the computer picks a candidate in ""The Year of the Yahoo,"" about the singer picked to be a senator, and we end with ""The Alley Tramp,"" which ""graphically portays the explosion of a woman.""

The only good thing about ""Blast-off Girls"" is that we are promised an appearance by Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Friend Chicken and the man himself does indeed show up to take care of product placement.  The titular females are Sherri Lane, Sharon Camile, Ann Heath, Julie Ames, Vicki Tenerelli, Sorasue Gless, and Barbara Harrison.  The only problem is that they are really minor characters in this film, which is about a struggling band, the Big Blast, as they deal with a corrupt music industry (and the fact that their music is pretty bad).  The band is not drawing big so the solution is to have these go-go dancers jump on stage and try to rip their clothes off (the band, not the go-go dancers, so you can see that being disappointed is inevitable).  This is a movie where when a woman tosses her towel to a man, the gentleman wags his finger at the camera and throws the towel over the lens.

This 1967 film stars Dan Conway as Boojie Baker the crooked manager and Ray Sager as Gordiea as his stupid henchman.  Playing the Big Blast are a Chicago garage band, the Faded Blue, which consists of Tom Tyrell, Ron Liace, Dennis Hickey, Chris Wolski, and Ralph Mullin.  Musically the group strikes me as a cross between the Dave Clark Five and the Doors, and neither or those references is meant in a good way.  Just think of this lame film as ""Help!"" Or ""Head"" or even ""Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter"" as done by a group without recognizable music talent whose acting talent is almost to the level of beginning high school students.

Both of these movies rate two stars and are so bad that not even the DVD extras can inspire me to give the DVD a higher rating.  You can end the evening by cleansing your palette and checking out the Gallery of Drive-In Exploitation Art with Trash-O-Rama Radio-Spot Rarities, the audio portion of which consists entirely of the barker for the Skyline Drive-In theater in Greenville, South Carolina (where they will have the criminally insane displayed in cages for the safety of their patrons), promoting the concession stand and talking up coming attractions.  Next week we are back to a pair of gruesome horror flicks from the golden age of drive-in fright fests with the double-feature of ""Screaming Skull"" and ""The Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman.""  Remember to put that speaker back on the post before your leave (or you will be prosecuted and pay a $50 fine).",1113177600,7,7130,4.4868421052631575
7933198,4,B000059H8L,"Blast-Off Girls, a little known art film that spins the web of a music promoter's need for power, delivers in true Americana fashion. Finally on DVD, true Athenian irony presents itself as a rock promoter tries to steer the career of an up and coming rock & roll band. The cane wielding promoter's intent readily unveils itself. He merely wants control and loyalty above everything else, even above his wallet. Rumored by Guajardian literary critic Miguel Hansoo to be the work that inspired Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here."" Whether that be the case or not, this film is worth viewing simply for a cameo by American fast-food icon Colonel Sanders, in which he proudly clucks "", OooEEEEEEE! We DO serve fried chicken!"" The band in the movie plays an improvised concert for Sanders in exchange for a bucket of chicken. Read into this apparent comedy relief closely though; Sanders places the bucket of chicken before the boy band whilst they play, then dances a step or two away from their performance. The Colonel may have done some ad-lib here to make a subtle declaration: that the free exchange of old school culinary treasure for modern day subversive rock music results in an unbreakable union that thwarts the possible resurrection of McCarthy like tactics that nearly destroyed the great Artisans of the USA. The contributions this underrated gem possesses is worth the price. Some may write this off as just another B-Movie, but look closely and you will find so much more.",984355200,18,1482,4.884920634920635
