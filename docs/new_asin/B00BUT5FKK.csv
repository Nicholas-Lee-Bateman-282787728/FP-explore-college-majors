8574203,5,B00BUT5FKK,The DVD was good as expected as far as Cliff's performance is considered . The surprising thing was the audience with their rigid behavior which very much reminds us of the Bony M performing Rasputin in Russia! This DVD clearly shows the difficulties the young Cliff went through in early days to popularize Rock & Roll. Only draw back was the German announcer who kept masking Cliff's comments in English. This DVD will be fully satiable if it had an English sub-title or English audio and German sub-title for Cliff's in between songs comments!,1473984000,,546,4.819148936170213
8574204,5,B00BUT5FKK,Having grown up in England in the 50's and 60's Cliff Richard was England's answer to Elvis. (I do of course like the KING). Cliff made so many records many of which were never released in the US and this particular concert was one that I had never seen before. I thoroughly enjoyed it even with the overlaid German commentaries. For any Cliff Richard fan this is a must and for those who don't know him to well it will be a pleasurable new experience.,1399161600,,452,4.329411764705882
8574205,5,B00BUT5FKK,"I love this dvd because it't so informal, with lots of behind the scenes shots. He is truly a "" living Doll"" in this one.",1398729600,,121,3.88
8574206,5,B00BUT5FKK,"CAUTION! I originally was upset that I could not view this DVD because it is PAL and not NTSC. I am updating my review to say that I was able to watch it on the computer and not the DVD player and now have changed my rating from a one star to a five. Amazon still needs to change the listing as it says Region 1 (U.S, and Canada) but it is not. Unfortunately, I saw it was marked for the U.S. and I didn't notice it says PAL--PAL is not U.S., NTSC is U.S. Thanks to my cousin who suggested trying it on the computer instead!",1375315200,7,524,3.9065420560747666
8574207,5,B00BUT5FKK,"Been a Cliff fan for over 55 years... I own just about anything he does, but this is a great DVD recorded in Berlin. It is a TV show with interview and him doing his hits up and until this was filmed. The production is brilliant. A must for any Cliff fan especially as so little is been released on him lately. The price is definitely worth it !",1373760000,,345,4.0144927536231885
8574208,5,B00BUT5FKK,"I do not want to affect the rating on this item, but it is very important that USA customers realize that this DVD will NOT play on USA DVD players, even though it is described as a Region 1 (USA) disc.  That's because it is also listed as PAL format (while NTSC is the format used in the USA).  Confusing, huh?  So unless you are SURE that you have a DVD player that will play PAL format as well as NTSC, I recommend that you do NOT purchase this item, or else you will land up having to return it.  BUYER BE WARE.",1372464000,6,515,3.970873786407767
8574209,5,B00BUT5FKK,"Not many Cliff Richard TV Shows survived the early 1970s by the BBC in the UK. However Cliff did a number of TV specials around Europe. This imported DVD from Germany is a TV special, Cliff recorded in September 1970 for a German TV Channel called SFB and was first Aired on 15 March 1971. The TV program was for Germany only and hence some German Language over dubbed on some of Cliff Richard's Interviews/intros to songs, which was made this way for the TV special which must be appreciated when this DVD is viewed outside Germany. I think for many Cliff fans, this is the first time they will see this TV show, though some clips have been available on youtube for a while and snippets on various Cliff Richard TV documentaries in the UK.

The song list:
1 Tracy-Sugar Sugar (Medley)
2 It's All In The Game
3 The Day I Met Marie
4 Interview/Montage in Berlin
5 I Saw The Light
6 Travellin' Light (Guitar Solo)
7 Montage/TV Clip of Cliff/Shadows Singing Move It from 1965)
8 Rock N Roll Medley: The Girl Can't Help It/Great Balls Of Fire/Lucille/Jailhouse Rock/Good Old Rock n' Roll/Do You Want To Dance
9 The Lady Came From Baltimore (Guitar Solo)
10 When I'm 64
11 Words (Brilliant Bee Gees cover version!)
12 Congratulations

This is a fantastic TV Special where Cliff sings full length performances for each song intersperse with Cliff around Berlin. There are dynamic camera shots/rehearsal scenes. Cliff's vocals are richly in fine form.

The DVD: Despite Amazon stating a Widescreen version, thankfully the DVD is the original 4:3 as originally broadcasted on German TV in Color.  The program is taken direct from the TV Master/vault and is fantastic broadcast quality! with original TV mono sound. There are chapter points to the program but not to the song list. Running time is 43 mins. It has a picture disc.

The DVD cover is interesting as a 1980 photo of Cliff is used for the picture cover rather than one from 1970/1971. Also the cover is reversible: one with German language and the other in English.

Overall this is a welcome DVD release of extremely rare TV footage of Cliff Richard. It would be nice if others like 'Getaway With Cliff' (1971) & 'The Case' (1972) can be release in this way.

I think a lot of Cliff Richard fans will love this DVD. Just FAB!!!",1370390400,,2281,4.603448275862069
