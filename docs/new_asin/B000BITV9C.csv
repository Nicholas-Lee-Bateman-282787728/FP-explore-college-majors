2419500,2,B000BITV9C,"""Arizona"" is a 1940 black and white western billed as ""the screen's mightiest spectacle of love and adventure."" Hmmm.

In 1867 Tucson, a woman owner of a freight service (Jean Arthur) is helped by a former Union Calvary soldier (William Holden) to overcome a gang of thieves run by a former Confederate (Warren William).

Jean Arthur (1900-91) is best known for her films with Frank Capra (""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""). She was a marvelous comedienne known for her ""screwball"" comedies like ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), but she had a wide range of skills and made ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), ""The Devil and Miss Jones"" (1941) and ""A Foreign Affair"" (1948). She was nominated for an Oscar for ""The More the Merrier"" (1943). Her last film was ""Shane"" (1953).
Arthur was 40 years old and her love interest, William Holden, was only 22, and the age difference shows. Nonetheless Arthur's performance as the pioneer woman is convincing.

William Holden (1918-81) was a terrific actor, with such memorable performances as writer Joe Gillis in ""Sunset Blvd"" (1950), Sergeant Sefton in ""Stalag 17"" (1953), Lt. Brubaker in ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri"" (1954), Hal Carter in ""Picnic"" (1955), Shears in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1967), Max Schumacher in ""Network"" (1976) and my personal favorite, Bishop Pike in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He won the Oscar for ""Stalag 17"" and was nominated for ""Network"" and ""Sunset Blvd"". He won an Emmy for ""The Blue Knight"" (1973) and was nominated for a Golden Laurel every year from 1958 through 1964. Photoplay named him most popular male star in 1954 and 1955. AFI named him the 25th greatest screen legend.

FWIW - I found it hard to recognize Holden and his face appears to be different. Perhaps it had something to do with his service in the War which followed this film.

Warren William (1894-1948) plays the sleazy former Confederate who will do anything to defeat Arthur. William is probably best known for his role as d""Artagnan in ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1939) and as the first Perry Mason in a series of mid 30s films.

The film was produced and directed by Wesley Ruggles (1889-1972) who is best known for his Oscar nominated ""Cimarron"" (1931) which has many resemblances to this film. Ruggles work centered on comedies beginning with his work in the silent era with Chaplain.

The top grossing films in 1940 were ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Rebecca"", ""Boom Town"", and ""Santa Fe Trail"". ""Rebecca"" won for best picture, James Stewart (""Philadelphia Story"") was best actor, and Ginger Rogers (""Kitty Foyle"") was best actress. Other notable films that year were westerns like Spencer Tracy in ""Northwest Passage"", Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan in ""The Westerner"", and Errol Flynn in ""Virginia City"", comedies like Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in ""My Favorite Wife"", Cary Grant and Roz Russell in ""His Girl Friday"", and W.C. Fields as ""The Bank Dick"" and with Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"".

The NY Times called it  ""a film spectacle that is crowded, sprawling, often exciting, extravagant in detail, obviously the result of colossal labor and expenditure"" but ""unfortunately, extravagance does not make drama, at least not the kind of drama one might expect from such an effort."" They said ""Arizona lacks the most important thing of all--a story with credible characters.""

Arizona has some good photography, a great location, and very interesting historical recreations, and it's interesting to see a woman as the central character in a western. There are a few other examples (Jane Russell in ""The Outlaw"", Marlene Dietrich in ""Rancho Notorious"", and Joan Crawford in ""Johnny Guitar"") but very few. But the script is a little cockeyed and the chief villain is really not up to the task. Nor is Holden, at 22, a convincing savior of the 40 year old Arthur. For a 2+ hour film, these are serious problems.

Bottom line - a great location and beautiful photography can't save a B western with a cockeyed script and an unconvincing cast.",1317427200,3,4018,4.911504424778761
2419501,4,B000BITV9C,"Columbia Pictures presents ""ARIZONA"" (1940  125 min/B&W) -- Starring: Jean Arthur, William Holden, Warren William, Porter Hall, Edgar Buchanan & Regis Toomey

Directed by Wesley Ruggles

Wesley Ruggles's Arizona is an epic western set in an impoverished Arizona outpost. It tells the story of the feisty, no-nonsense Phoebe Titus (Jean Arthur). Wearing leather breeches, with a bull whip and gun, she can out-shoot and out-fight nearly every bad hombre in town, and manages to transform the down-and-out community into Tuscon, one of the most respected towns in the West. When handsome Peter Muncie (William Holden) arrives, on his way to California, Phoebe asserts that he is the perfect person to help her run her cattle ranch, and the two fall in love. But one obstacle makes their plans extremely difficult: con man Jefferson Carteret (Warren William), who secretly hatches a plan to cheat Phoebe out of the property and annihilate Peter on the couple's wedding day!

Oscar Nominated for Best Music (Victor Young) & Best Art Direction (B&W)

Columbia Pictures were so pleased with the success of this film that they commissioned a sort-of-follow-up: Texas (1941) which also starred William Holden. Texas (1941)

* Special footnote: -- The set still stands outside Tucson Arizona and is an active studio and Old West theme park called Old Tucson. Since it was built in 1939, Old Tucson has served as the set for many famous Westerns such as Rio Bravo and Tombstone. Little House on the Prairie also used the studios.

2419502,4,B000BITV9C,"I just viewed this 1940 movie a few days ago. Overall,the picture was above average for two or three reasons. First of all,the cinematography is superb and secondly,Jean Arthur's fine performance elevates my opinion. There is a very brief moment near the end of the movie,when Arthur's character(Phoebe),is standing off by herself waiting for the outcome of the gunfight between her new husband(Holden)and the villain(Warren William).No words are spoken but in less than thirty seconds of a closeup on Arthur,her expressions shift from terror(at the sound of gunshots),to hope,and finally to extreme relief when she hears Holden's voice. A simply superb piece of acting by the wonderful Jean Arthur. If you buy this movie and if you are a Jean Arthur fan,you will not be disappointed.",1235433600,13,784,5.23015873015873
2419503,5,B000BITV9C,"This is a great movie about a woman turns an army outpost into Tucson, Arizona.  Of course she needs plenty of help to do so, and she gets it.  Jean Arthur and William Holden are a perfect match.  With a good balance of comedy, romance, and adventure, this movie delivers!",1222732800,,272,4.4
2419504,4,B000BITV9C,"Go west and find your riches, as the west offers new opportunities that await discovery.  This was the idea of the 18th and 19th century America, which led many to seek a new and better future in the unknown west.  It led to the colonization of the western United States, which continued over centuries, as people began to inhabit different regions of the west.  It was not an easy journey, as the Native Americans sought a way to protect their way of life against the new invaders while nature also presented numerous threats.  Despite the many hazards, people continued to flow west with the hope for something better.  Director Wesley Ruggles portrays the struggle of the western expansion through a woman and the people around her, as they fight for their southwest state - Arizona.

Arizona opens with a rolling text that briefly explains the situation, as a large caravan rolls into the meager town of Tucson in the year 1860.  Tucson has become a gathering place for a diverse group of people, as they for some reason have to end their journey west at this arid town.  There is no law enforcement present to offer safety, which means that those with the ability to fend for themselves often deliver their own justice.  Phoebe Titus (Jean Arthur) is such a woman, and she does not fit the traditional norm for a woman of the 19th century.  She is a jeans wearing entrepreneur with a charisma resembling Jean d'Arc who has exchange her sword for a six-shooter while willingly dealing with those who try to take advantage of her on her own accord.

Despite her independence and strong will, Phoebe still presents a feminine persona by baking pies while presently being the only known Caucasian woman in the state of Arizona.  Thus, many men find her intriguing, and one of these men is Peter Muncie (William Holden).  Peter eyes her and it is apparent that she makes quite an impact on him from the first encounter when she is dealing with two thieves.  The affection is mutual; however, both have equal difficulty to express their feelings.  Nonetheless, Phoebe expresses her emotions by offering him a job, as a caravan pilot for her newly started freight business.  However, he kindly declines, as he must see California before it is too late for him, but promises to return.

Phoebe's business venture begins to run smoothly, until the beginning of the Civil War. It becomes a time of hardships, as the military withdraw from Arizona to fight the war in the east.  Meanwhile, Phoebe and the people of Tucson must find an alternative way of safeguarding their homes and lives against a rampant war with the Native Americans, which Arizona does by joining the Confederate side.  It becomes a time of much difficulty for Phoebe, but she does not surrender to the hardships.  Instead, it seems as if she is flourishing in the difficulties while her mind occasionally drifts to Peter.  Unaware of his possible return others begin to show interest such as the shady character Jefferson Carteret (Warren William) who befriends Phoebe with ulterior motives.

Arizona presents an interesting film that captures some of the hardships that the pioneers dealt with, and to cast a feminine lead makes it even more fascinating.  How the film portrays the Native Americans is unsettling, yet it was a common portrayal in the 1930s and 1940s.  Despite this ethnic fallacy, the film still provides an accurate illustration of how the first Arizonans experienced the migration west and some of the difficulties that they faced in the dawning of the new state.  Eventually, the audience will recognize the resolute perseverance that the pioneers had to possess in order to manage through the repetitive adversity that nature and other forces caused upon those who sought a better way of life in the arid Arizona.",1132012800,41,3801,4.855813953488372

2419608,4,B000BITV9C,"This sweeping historical western should've made more of a dent at the 1940 box office, except for its abysmal timing and an unforgiving climate. As it were, ARIZONA, wildly lambested as a financial catastrophe, has several redeeming elements, not the least of which is its feisty, quivery-voiced female lead.

In 1860 the wagons rolled westward like dusty tides, vessels of ambition and grand dreams, harbingers of manifest destiny. The indiscriminate camera pans over the cluttered shambles that make up the Tucson outpost nestled deep in lawless Arizona territory. Some fellow's deadpan remark: ""Well, here you are - sweetest little city this side of a rathole."" The latest caravan brings young drifter Peter Muncie (William Holden) to Tucson and eventually to Tucson's most ornery citizen, Phoebe Titus (Jean Arthur). And Ms. Titus, we promptly detect, is the fulcrum from which the narrative pivots.

With her impeccable timing and delivery and that oh-so-tremulous voice, Jean Arthur was indisputably one of cinema's finest comediennes and was known for playing strong, independent women that could be simultaneously tough and tender. She sparkled in several of my favorite comedies ever: 1936's MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, 1938's YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, 1941's THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES, and 1943's THE MORE THE MERRIER. But she dabbled in other genres and held up her end, such as in drama (1937's HISTORY IS MADE AT NIGHT, 1939's ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS), in the whodunit (1936's THE EX-MRS. BRADFORD), and the western (1936's THE PLAINSMAN, 1953's SHANE). In ARIZONA Jean Arthur holds court as the britches-wearing, rifle-touting, pie-baking hellion who takes no crap from any man. Her opening scene has her bracing a pair of scalawags what's made off with her money. This show of spunk impresses newcomer Peter Muncie and curbs his wanderlust long enough that he breaks out his banjo and serenades her later on that evenin' with ""Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair."" And I'm pretty sure that's William Holden himself belting out the tune.

It's a fleeting romance, anyway, as Muncie's restlessness soon drives him to California, leaving Phoebe Titus to forge a flourishing community out of Tucson. Turns out, this pioneer woman is at her formidable best when she's applying her keen business sense. Oily opposition comes in the shape of Jefferson Carteret (Warren William), the smooth-talking dandy whose sly machinations jeopardize Phoebe Titus' burgeoning freight line empire. Oh, only if there were a certain restless drifter to champion her cause.

William Holden was only 22 when ARIZONA was filmed - and thirteen years younger than Arthur. This was still very much early days in his career. But he holds the screen well and matches Arthur shot for shot, and we don't think the less of him for the gender role reversal. Again, this is Jean Arthur's movie, and she's terrific and I love the big swagger she brings. This western is not without its flaws. The pace is languid, there's a lack in action, the reprobates (Warren William and Porter Hall) telegraph their villainy, and the climactic duel takes place off-camera. And, oh, if only this film didn't coincide with the advent of WWII so as to compel Columbia chief Harry Cohn - fearful of an underperforming European market - to pull the plug. Frantic lobbying from the director reversed the studio's decision and the film was green lit again, but not before some judicious budget restructuring. As it were, the film went on to exceed its budget, what with the intolerable Arizona heat shutting down days of shooting. And yet, if you're looking for a spectacle, this movie has it in sweeping, sprawling, turbulent servings. Immense labor went into the making of the sets. They're so convincing, it's as if you can hear the shudder and creak on the makeshift tenements or smell the sweat on the unwashed populace and the steamy stank off them cow pies. Smells like history.",1423353600,,3937,5.043010752688172

2419645,5,B000BITV9C,"This movie was filmed in 1939 at the then newly constructed Old Tucson Studios. The studio sits in the Sonoran Desert approximately 12 miles from the modern day Tucson. It was constructed for this movie but went on to host many productions over the years. Stars such as John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Maurine O'Hara, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Ward Bond, Robert Mitchum, Michael Landon, Walter Brennan and so many, many more made film history there. Many made for TV movies and shows were filmed there along with countless commercials. It is also the home of the old TV series High Chaparral . The historical significance alone makes this a must see film. However, regardless of it's history, Jean Arthur and William Holden make this film the true classic it is. Most of the Old Tucson Studio was destroyed by fire several years ago which gives us even more reason to collect and appreciate these wonderful historical films. Films that we will be able to enjoy for years to come. If you are a western fan, you will not be disappointed. So, sit back, relax and enjoy a true piece of the old west.",1392076800,7,1091,4.658031088082901

2419652,5,B000BITV9C,"A great change for Jean Arthur to play a tough-no-nonse pioneer woman. She gives a brilliant performance and is one of my favorite Jean Arthur roles.

William Holden plays a great hero-type role as he weds Phoebe (Jean Arthur) and helps her save her ranch and cattle.

The movie moves well and has plenty of excitement with great supporting stars like Warren William, Edgar Buchanan, and Porter Hall. It's great to see how the west was back then when trying to build new land while fighting off Indians and bandits.

8087297,5,B000BITV9C,"Great movie! I really enjoyed this one with JEAN ARTHUR. I'm a fan of hers, so I had never seen this one. After seeing her in SHANE, I found this at a used DVD/BOOK place. Very reasonable price and the picture quality of this DVD is decent.
I hope there is a Blu-ray version out soon of it with some special features.

This is distributed by MILL CREEK. They are known for not having ANY Special Features at all on their releases. Movie only.
Sound and picture quality are pretty good for a DVD. If you like Jean Arthur and Westerns in general, I think you will like ARIZONA as well!
