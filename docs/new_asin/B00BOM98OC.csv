5661981,3,B00BOM98OC,Slow paced and in some places a bit hard to comprehend. Why a young woman would openly choose to be homeless living in a tent. Oh no mom don't plead for me to come home and live that luxury lifetsyle by the pool. I prefer potential rapists and mosquitos living in a tent. What is the odds that father who abandoned her would show up in the middle of nowhere (He too living a hermit lifetsyle)? Oh dispense with believability and it is an ok movie. 3 stars,1372377600,,455,4.181818181818182
5661982,3,B00BOM98OC,"I have to say had I seen this when I was 15, I would have loved it. I was almost hoping for more depth than what it provided. A little predictable but still a feel good kind of ""chick flick.""",1371340800,,191,3.8

5661984,3,B00BOM98OC,"There are moments in life when we all feel the need to embark upon a quest. Sometimes we run from something, and sometimes we run toward the goal post. When that journey happens early, it can certainly provide the necessary backdrop for a coming-of-age tale.

Even with top actors like Andy Garcia, Juliette Lewis and Camilla Belle, I didn't expect much from the Open Road and its $3 Million budget. But I am a father, and as such, the plot of a daughter taking to the road to track down an estranged father that abandoned the family... well, it resonated with me. So, while I knew this was a ""chick-flick,"" I welcomed the intensity break after having watched a spate of high-octane Sci-fi/Horror films.

Overall, while the pacing was a tad slow, the ""Open Road"" was a feel good, family-friendly ride. Angie (played by the attractive Camilla Belle) is trying to deal with the emotional hurt from her father leaving, and needs to reconcile these events before her life can return to a more predictable path. The acting was solid, the cinematography was fine and the story was consistent, albeit a bit white-washed. The movie never depicts the harsh reality of living on the go without a roof over your head. Angie camps in the woods, sleeps in her car, stays pretty and paints - that's a fairly sanitized vision. The one haunting experience that she suffers through is presented to the viewer in piecemeal flashbacks with an outcome that is never quite shown - we are left wondering if she escaped or was forced to endure the encounter. This perhaps calls to mind a weakness in the film... the transitions leave a lot of questions, and deeper writing would have enhanced the offering. However, the chemistry between the characters was excellent at times (there is a young-love story), and the ending does elicit that old-fashioned Hollywood smile - even if this is an independent film studio.

Parental Advisory - There is no nudity and the language is fine. However, the thoughtful plot and ""possible"" sexual attack leads me to suggest that PG-13 is the minimum. As for the entire movie... 3 out of 5 on my Indie scale.",1370563200,12,2119,4.737127371273712

5661986,3,B00BOM98OC,So first I have to write that my English is not the best... I am sorry about that fact... At first I thought the film let me get tired... Long I did not understand what the woman is searching for... She was searching for her father... Then I was very shocked when she left her boyfriend without any word! The last I did not know til yet what was with the two men who attacked her in the meadow... What happenend there - did she run away? Did they catched her or what? I enjoyed the film and did not fell asleep. I think it is worth to see it! Enjoy it!,1408752000,,552,3.9375

5661988,2,B00BOM98OC,"The beginning of OPEN ROAD is highly suggestive, with director Marco Garcia depicting different moments in Angie's (Camilla Belle's) life, as she works as a server, travels along a lonely road, and tries to communicate with her mother back in Brazil.  It's clear she's got something to hide, but we have no idea what; all we know is that she is a talented artist, who translates all her emotional pain into her paintings.  So far so good; but then the film experiences a failure of nerve and transforms itself into a familiar tale of self-discovery.  Angie meets nice boyfriend (Colin Egglesfield), and his skeptical cousin (Juliette Lewis), leaves her boyfriend in the lurch as she goes off on the road, and discovers at the end of the film that her friend Chuck (Andy Garcia) - whom she encountered at her lowest point during her journey - has a dark secret directly relating to her own life.  At times the script veers towards the banal, and although the film is well photographed, with several aerial shots of the rolling landscape with Angie's car just a speck on the horizon, one cannot help but feel that director Garcia could have done far more with the material.",1392595200,,1171,4.7254901960784315

8571923,5,B00BOM98OC,"Heart warming movie about finding yourself On The Road. Loved the honest vulnerability of the lead female character. Loved the honest portrayal of what it is to travel alone as a female. Interesting to feel the need projections that other people put on her as a women alone like there is something wrong with being female and choosing to be alone. I appreciated her dedication to her own creative expression and allowing others to feel their own disappointment when she stayed true to herself. It is when she is able to be strong in herself that she is then able to really ""find her father"" within and without and heal herself and her family. The Open Road is a open heart.",1519084800,,673,4.570247933884297
8571924,2,B00BOM98OC,"I was expecting more of a fluffy romantic movie. The first 25-30 minutes were a great intro to the lead character. But everything after that just dragged on and on and seemed anti-climactic. It felt like just watching someone living their quiet life. Nothing too exciting. Nothing extraordinary. Just watching a girl go through the same circumstances that a lot of people go through.
I took away a star for the attempted-rape flashbacks. At the end of the movie you are left wondering why in the world those were included at all. They added nothing to the story. My only guess is that it was used as a red herring - she mentions throughout the movie that she's looking for someone. So maybe the flashbacks are to lead us to believe she is looking for her attackers? I'm not sure. That's the only reason I can come up with. And then they leave that storyline completely untold and unresolved. I don't know. I guess I think if you're going to take on a subject like rape or abuse, you need to commit to it and present it properly. Not just toss it in as an afterthought to mislead the viewers.",1463702400,,1091,4.46
