8118337,3,B000F6ZEUU,"This review concerns the DVD=R authored by Amazon when an order is placed, about Jackie Pullinger&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JACKIE-PULLINGER/dp/B002KOM1S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JACKIE PULLINGER</a>.  I have not viewed the DVD, but based on my reading of her initial book (Chasing the Dragon) at least 3 times before relocating to Hong Kong myself as a seminary teacher and missionary 29 years ago (1984 - and still here), if reviewers say she spoke in tongues at an early time in her ministry, based on later publications, I'd have to say there's a major redactor at work!  Either my memory is woefully forgetful, or someone has been rewriting her history. I also visited her meetings early on and did not observe any such behavior.  What I DO remember is that after she was visited by members of the Vineyard movement and was instructed about her need for that ""gift"" that she began manifesting the same.  I find it remarkable how few people remember how much she (with God's help) accomplished through simple""?"" faith, love, persistence, and patience without the need for any gift of an ""unknown tongue"" whose utterance was never ""interpreted"" for the benefit of the Church on the two or three times I was present--despite Paul's explicit instructions to the contrary.
  Yet, all this does not and cannot serve to belittle her faith and submission to God's calling on behalf of the people once in bondage to sin and sin's master.",1382400000,,1485,5.271186440677966

8118339,3,B000F6ZEUU,"""Chasing the Dragon"" by Jackie Pullinger was the first dawning of the validity of the gift of tongues in my emergent understanding of the Holy Spirit. It was a jolt for me to come slap up against stories that were told without pretense or undue drama. It's a powerful narrative from an icon of mission history. I had seen a DVD on Jackie's ""Walled City"" ministry which I was unable to find but wanted to share with several young women who are, themselves, venturing into service in Asia - so, I purchased this DVD. While this movie may have fulfilled the vision of its producers, I found it disappointing and lack-luster. There is so much more to tell and to show. The interview format simply can't color in the richness of Jackie's contribution to missiology or her raw courage as she faced off the triad gang with tranforming love. If you can find it - go for the other DVD! It seems it may have been called, ""The City of Love"" or something similar.",1286755200,2,951,4.471264367816092
8118340,4,B000F6ZEUU,"This is an amazing story of faith and courage that all should see. For a young 20 something white woman with blonde hair, to venture alone into Hong Kong without any official backing or support was truly amazing.
Jackie Pullinger is a hero of faith and example for us that nothing is impossible to those who believe.
The miracle of the gospel of Jesus is that believers today have the same power that Jesus had to restore broken lives.
Pullinger discovers this after facing indifference from those she was trying to reach. Her message was powerless until she began speaking in tongues daily for 20 minutes. Immediately she saw results.
No one can deny the results of this work in the Walled City where Triads and drug addicts werre changed forever.
The main thing that powered this woman's ministry and still does is the gift of Tongues received by faith when a believer in Jesus asks God to give them the Holy Spirit.",1271203200,2,918,4.638036809815951
