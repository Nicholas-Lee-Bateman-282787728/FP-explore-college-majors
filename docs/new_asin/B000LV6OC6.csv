2714305,5,B000LV6OC6,"For americans or europeans this is the movie to see if you want to understand the Chilean process, and all the damage done by the CIA helping the right wing and the military. Is exactly the moment when everything broke, when nothing could be fixed and when the terror started to spread on the surface of the earth.",1129680000,6,314,4.431034482758621
2714306,4,B000LV6OC6,"This film, presented very recently in Ottawa on celluloid, is a moving,believable tale of two youngsters from different social strata, Pedro and Gonzalo, who become classmates and friends due to the efforts of a compassionate priest (who seems to have actually existed)in allowing a group of poor children to attend an exclusive private school in Santiago during the latter part of Salvador Allende's presidency. Their friendship is portrayed realistically, and when Gonzalo visits the shantytown in which Pedro lives, it is easy to see why someone like Allende who promised Chile social and economic equality would be elected. The two youngsters' friendship,damaged just before the coup that led to Allende's death and Pinochet's decades-long rule, is broken as the school is taken over by the military and the shantytown where Pedro lives is razed by the new autocratic regime. If ""Machuca"" does find release as a compatible DVD (there is, strangely, a Betamax video version of it), it should be viewed and appreciated by many (it has been noticed at film festivals).",1126828800,13,1069,5.22093023255814
2714307,5,B000LV6OC6,"First of all... (with regards to the bad review above.)-  The notation next to the movie (DVD) clearly states NON USA Format.  That means... that it will not work in the US region.  Countries have different DVD coded regions, to be able to maximize their sales in a certain country.  This code prevents the movie from being read by a DVD player foreign to the code on the DVD.  You will either have to hack your DVD player in order to bypass the code or wait until a US region coded DVD comes out.  This movie is a very accurate depiction of a young generations point of view of the fall of Allende and Pinochet's rise to power.  The movie is intelligent and warm.  A great learning experience for those unexposed to an important point in history made for the world.",1125705600,6,766,4.382978723404255

2714323,5,B000LV6OC6,"There is so much to commend this movie.

Firstly, it offers an astoundingly well balanced perspective on the relative merits and demerits of the rightist and leftist movement in Chile during this period.  It portrays the social complexities as they are and avoids the temptation to create a sanitized black and white opinion piece.

The storyline of the friendship between the boys on opposite sides of the socioeconomic device serves as a metaphor for the larger context in which they live.  The story is well told, interesting and compelling.

Brilliant.",1393891200,,556,5.133333333333334
2714324,5,B000LV6OC6,"This film depicts the events of 9/11/73 in Chile through the eyes of two children from very different walks of life - that through a series of events - come together.  What sets this film apart is its incredible authenticity to the characters, the times, the cultures,  the language, to the emotion of Chilenos at this time in history.  I use this film in my Spanish language and film class.  Recommended for junior / seniors in high school and university students.  Much strong language.  Very recommended.  My students (and I) love this film.  Background research is needed to have a full understanding of Chile at this time.",1380931200,3,627,4.794392523364486
2714325,5,B000LV6OC6,"Andrs Wood, director of Violeta Went to Heaven, effectively fuses a heart-warming tale of friendship with the enlightening reality of Chile in the early 1970s in his film Machuca . Salvador Allende's socialist policies and Pinochet's later coup d'etat highlight the division of the rich and poor; the latter is motivated by Chile's new leadership, and the upper class is fearful of change. The film is shown from the perspective of eleven year-olds Gonzalo Infante and Pedro Machuca, who become unlikely companions when the headmaster at an elite school grants full scholarships to poor boys in the area, like Pedro. The contrast of Gonzalo's comfortable upper-middle class background and Pedro's poverty echo the division in Chile at the time, as their friendship is tested by their economical backgrounds. The acting is exceptional, especially on part of the young lead roles. I highly recommend watching!",1374451200,,907,5.305555555555555
2714326,5,B000LV6OC6,"Captures the upheaval of Chile in the early seventies.  For all serious fans of Chilean history.
The movie explores many social and economic questions between different segments of society.  Excellent acting all around and I felt as though I was in 1973.  Good filmmaking and excellent capture of the mood of Chile at this time.  Will not disappoint.",1372636800,3,350,4.982758620689655
2714327,5,B000LV6OC6,"To reclaim back from a period of silence and to prise open Chile in the period before the coup of 1973,Andreas Wood has directed the film Machuca,about the coming of age of children,based upon his own personal memories and those of other people he's interviewed from the period,both those who were children then and the priest involved. Told through their eyes,especially Gonzalo(Matias Quer),from a wealthy middle-class neighbourhood,and Pedro Machuca(Mateluna),who lives in a nearby shantytown. The stress is on the social aspects of the class system,the gulf between the rich and poor. Made in the tradition of school films like Au Revoir Les Enfants,Kes and If. The private school in question is St. Patrick's School of English where they meet when an idealistic priest admits children from poor families,and they learn about each other's very different worlds,where they develop a strong bond.

It's made clear the politics is in the background,which gives the director the freedom from Gonzalo's POV(a passive,reflecting instrument) to show everything he wanted to show. So people who weren't there can experience through the many layers and different characters,what the experience was like. Gonzalo lives with his mother,elder
sister and father,a businessman. His mother has an elderly lover/businessman who buys Gonzalo books on the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Someone says ""a white man could never mix with an Indian"".Gonzalo is not enchanted by this arrangement. Gonzalo and Pedro fight off school bullies and visit or stay over at each other's homes. Pedro's father is a drunk and warns Pedro that his friend will be running his dad's business when he is still a toilet cleaner. They all go out on rallies with Sylvana's father where they sell flags both to the nationalists and to the socialists and enthusiastically participate. Middle-class resentment has been building up both in school parent -meetings and on the streets. Slogans are on all the walls. Graffiti of a Marxist kind are being erased.

Gonzalo's mother is vain,has never grown up but is loving towards her son,getting luxuries from the black market from her lover. His sister has a right wing boyfriend who tries to intimidate Gonzalo and his friend. Clothes play a big part in his life so the film opens with him getting dressed for school. Pedro's clothes have holes,he is loaned
Adidas trainers by Gonzalo,he goes swimming in his underwear. His outdoor toilet is clogged with s***.As violence encroaches into their lives and the coup takes place,with two jets flying directly overhead to the Palace, the school is taken over by the military,the priest is kicked out but before leaving eats all the wafers to imply sacredness has left the school. Cycling through the shanty town Gonzalo witnesses the iron hand of the Junta crushing the tenants of the shanty town,and as he cycles through the smoke of hell looks helplessly back at Pedro and his mother being taken away. Pinochet's CIA-backed coup is behind every frame of this film but its charm is in a nostalgia of childhood,criss-crossing class barriers,the potential to be different. Visually impressive,the film has a grainy look,with-holding and revealing information at the same time shot on 16mm. Key actions of history take place outside of the frame. We feel the claustrophobia and the march of time.",1364515200,,3338,5.17962962962963
2714328,5,B000LV6OC6,"Great movie depicting a difficult time in Chile. It had funny, sad and informative moments.  A piece of history from a child's perspective.",1351555200,,139,5.043478260869565
2714329,4,B000LV6OC6,"This is one of the best Latin American films that I've seen in a while. The historical aspect of the film is treated beautifully, with a powerful ending that is bound to stay with this viewer for a very long time. I loved the look of the film- early 1970 fashion in full bloom. I think that the story of the middle class family could have been edited a bit better and for me, some of those scenes were a bit ambiguous. However, the overall film is powerful, poignant and memorable.",1309392000,,481,4.2967032967032965
2714330,4,B000LV6OC6,I was an American student at St Georges college in Santiago where this story takes place.  The movie authentically captures a dark period in Chile's history and conveys a profound social message. I was disappointed that the version I received did not include english subtitles.,1298937600,2,277,5.155555555555556
2714331,5,B000LV6OC6,"A beautiful movie of dawning Pinochet's time Chile as boys from different walks of life befriended attending the same Catholic school.

2714332,5,B000LV6OC6,Great film focused on the dictatorship that took place in the country of Chile in the late 1970s.  It is a beautifully told story and is an important one to know and understand.  After studying abroad in Chile my undestanding grew and I find it important that everyone knows the story of this time.,1265673600,2,298,4.5
2714333,5,B000LV6OC6,"Prepare yourself to be stunned and moved by this award-winning 2004 film.

""Only children and drunks don't lie,"" exclaims a young firebrand teenage girl articulating the controversial film's central theme.

The lives of three children, attracted despite class and educational backgrounds, come together and fall apart in this dark coming of age during a time of violent social conflict film. Children discover the lies, obsessions, hopes, and fears of adults in in Chile in 1973 - before and after the coup. They discover that friendship and good intentions are far too weak in the face of prejudice, tradition, hunger, and violence.

See the film, travel back to a time of political fanaticism, and watch the pleasures of youth become painful, mature understandings. Although more poignant than Missing, the film also seems less overtly political in its story. Yet this sometimes sweet film packs a very hard punch.",1226793600,7,916,5.217687074829932
2714334,4,B000LV6OC6,"This is a story of 2 young Chilean boys who befriend one another during the turmoil of the Allende era. One boy is from a well to do family & enjoys a life of privilege. The other boy is from a poor family & is mistreated by society & the government.
This movie is well worth the money but be aware that unless you can get hold of a disk equipped with English subtitles, you will need some knowledge of Spanish to get the most from this film.",1217289600,12,442,4.034090909090909
2714335,5,B000LV6OC6,"This movie is about the other 9/11--meaning 9/11/73 in Chile.  There was a military coup that is little known in the US.  The movie gives you the perspective of 2 boys growing up during that time.  It is said that the director, Andres Wood, based the movie on his own experience growing up in Santiago.  Great movie, great acting, great story.  It will leave a print on your heart.",1208044800,13,381,4.463768115942029
2714336,4,B000LV6OC6,"Set in 1973 in the months leading up to the military takeover of Allende's democratically elected socialist government in Chile, this film looks back 35 years to offer a picture of social and political conflict that is full of ambiguities. Declining to take sides in the clash between middle-class haves and lower-class havenots, it reveals the well-to-do as insensitive and decadent and the poor as often hostile, duplicitous, and. cynical We identify instead with the children in the film who reach across class lines out of friendship and curiosity.

Setting his story within the walls of a boys school, the homes of his central characters, and the streets of Santiago, which fill with noisy demonstrations, Director Woods effectively represents a country teetering on the verge of civil war. Food supplies disappear into a thriving black market and a private school's attempt to admit a token handful of shantytown students precipitates an uproar from well-to-do parents who resent the breaking down of class barriers. Finally there is violence and bloodshed at the hands of the military, the undisputed villains of the film, who heavy-handedly restore order in the closing scenes, leaving its two young protagonists separated and receding into a kind of fog, represented by a literal loss of focus by the camera's lens. At two hours, the film takes time to illuminate the complexities of its subject matter, and it neatly dismisses any easy assumptions about what really led to Chile's decades-long military dictatorship.",1193529600,2,1526,5.254098360655738
2714337,5,B000LV6OC6,I saw this movie in when it was showing in Chile and had been waiting for it to be released in the U.S. ever since. An excellent film.,1184198400,,134,3.8214285714285716
2714338,4,B000LV6OC6,"Andrs Wood is a highly regarded Chilean filmmaker, a man unafraid to take on controversial issues and present them in a manner that is revelatory to his audience, whether that audience is in Chile or other South American countries - or in Europe or North America. In MACHUCA he transports us to the year 1973 in Chile when Pinochet's military coup overthrew Allende's socialist 'democracy'. Knowing that there remains a divided opinion of this period of time, a time when Allende supporters who could not escape the country were murdered or placed in detention camps as political prisoners, Woods sensitively recreates this period through the eyes of children from the populace divided by the middle class and the poor, a technique which works on every level.

Saint Patrick's School for boys in Santiago is headed by a kind priest/principal Father McEnroe (Ernesto Malbran) and the rich to middle class uniformed boys include one 'strawberry faced', quiet, chubby Gonzalo Infante (Matas Quer) whose family is of means but has issues of covert infidelity with the mother (Aline Kppenheim) and father (Francisco Reyes). The Allende government is shaky, and in an attempt to appease the poor class, Saint Patrick's School takes on students from the shantytowns to 'democratize' education. Among these new students is Pedro Machuca (Ariel Mateluna) who seems to be a loner but soon becomes the brunt of the rich kids' prejudice. Gonzalo befriends Pedro and gradually the two form a strong bond which leads to each of the boys learning about their separate families and life styles: Gonzalo's life of luxury dazzles Pedro while Pedro's humble shack houses warm family that Gonzalo envies. The friendship leads to a close examination of the schism of racism and political clashes brought into sharp focus as the military coup changes everything. Only friendship remains intact in a dramatically tested fashion.

Andrs Woods marries the political and the human aspects of this chaotic time in Chile and offers us insights into the ongoing changing governments of South America. His script (which he wrote with Eliseo Altunaga, Roberto Brodsky and Mamoun Hassan) is spare leaving space for much of the story to be told by observing the interaction of his two main characters with their associates. The result is a deeply moving film, an opportunity to observe the tenuous times of a period most of us barely understand. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, May 07",1178496000,55,2451,5.125

2714340,5,B000LV6OC6,"Comparable to Louis Malle's ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", this is a very moving and beautiful melodrama about two kids growing together in the midst of the conflicts arising with the proclamation of Salvador Allende as the first socialist Chilean President which eventually led to a ""coup d'etat"" in september 1973, a violent conflict that closes the story. The quality of this movie is not surprising if you consider that Andrs Wood is behind the camera; actually, he's been responsible for the most interesting movies done in Chile in recent years (""Historias de Futbol"", ""El Desquite"", ""La Fiebre del Loco""). One of the aspects that calls the attention the most in the movie is the excellent work of the three main young protagonists (Ariel Mateluna, Matas Quer and Manuela Martelli)who had no screen experience at all. An important artistic and commercial success in Chile, it deserves the attention of viewers who want to know about the social and political situation in Chile back in the 70's. According to national standards, this is - by far - one of the best and most important movies coming out from Chile lately.",1156118400,3,1118,4.952127659574468
2714341,5,B000LV6OC6,"Like other reviews have already noted, this movie takes place in Chile in the early 70s during the last days of Allende's presidency.  It depicts 2 young boys' struggle to be friends despite thier socio-economic differences.  Although there are frequent clips of the coup and of protests, this film is really more about the human relationships and how they were affected by the politics of the era, not vice versa. In fact, it may help your understanding of the film a little to already have some background info on the coup, as the film doesn't delve too deeply to explain it.",1135382400,7,577,4.702970297029703
