1321982,5,B00003CY27,"I saw this film a year ago in Palm Springs - where it is still playing at least twice a day - and it is the funniest film I've seen in ages.  You can't help but laugh out loud.  Well written, well acted, and well directed.  I've been waiting for ages for the dvd to become available as it is a must for anyone's collection.  Everyone needs to see this film!!!",1043798400,,359,4.014084507042254
1321983,5,B00003CY27,Leslie has certainly shown all why is a master. I was on the floor hysterical. Everyone and anyone can find someone to relate to in this family. I have seen this movie 4 times and cannot ever be tired of it. It is a Palm Springs must see every time I visit. I have turned on so many people to this film. Everyone should own this DVD.,1043193600,,333,3.985074626865672
1321984,5,B00003CY27,"I saw this film at a fund-raising event in East Stroudsburg, PA today (12/8/02)to benefit the Lehigh Valley F.A.C.T. (Fighting Aids Continuously Together) and I can't recall a more enjoyable movie.  I have a good friend who is very active in the organization and, when I read about the performance, thought it sounded like something I might find interesting.  Well ... that was certainly the case. Excellent cast and the actor portraying the young gay male is yummy (and, I couldn't care less if he's  straight or not ... he's talented!). The audience was truly diverse and everyone there seemed to find it vastly amusing and -- in some scenes -- extremely touching.  Talented cast and great music.  I'm ordering the DVD because: 1) I missed some of the lines due to the audience's (and my) raucous laughter and 2) I want to share it w/ family and friends and revel in their enjoyment.
I LOVED this movie!  (For the record, I am 70 years old and a grandmother, happily married and lucky to be who I am!)",1039305600,22,1003,4.606741573033708
1321985,5,B00003CY27,"I have seen this movie 5 times in Palm Springs and met the cast and writers and producer, they are incredible and at the one year anniversary of the movie playing in Palm Springs I even dressed up as brother boy doing Tammy Wynette.  A must see for anyone raised in the south that will keep you laughing time and time again.  A great story of acceptance and family....we are all different but we are still family",1037836800,3,412,4.337662337662338

1322118,4,B00003CY27,"Though watching it was sometimes painful, I nevertheless liked it. A friend recommended it when he learned that I grew up in West Texas, the setting of this movie. It awkwardly but accurately draws not-terribly-exaggerated caricatures of the people who live there. My hometown, Abilene, even got a mention.",1514592000,,306,5.26530612244898

Great entertainment for adults that have experience of either having a diverse family &/or Friends that ultimately get along with all the challenges in this life!  Should be a ""cult classic"", regardless we won't tire of occasionally viewing; especially when we need some good ol' LAUGHING/amusement therapy!  Probably best for ages 21+.",1513296000,,469,5.0519480519480515

1322420,3,B00003CY27,"One has to be in the right mood for this very broad, non-too-subtle satire on the funeral mores of some fictitious Texas community.  The casting is golden.  These, for the most part, are not well known actors. But they perform their roles as if they were members of an obscure, but talented theatre troupe at the top of the game and accustomed to working together.  Yes, they are caricatures.  But they blur those caricature lines just enough so that you can believe these folk and maybe even empathize.  Standouts are Delta Burke as the cheated-upon wife, Bonnie Bedelia as the strait-laced Puritanical mother of the gay actor, the fabulous actress playing the sister of the deceased (said sister is trying a new smoking cessation therapy with the help of a rubber band.  Wait for the punch line here!), and the sincere, gorgeous young man playing the struggling gay actor.  In my opinion, Brother Boy, who has been institutionalized for anti-homosexual therapy for twenty-three years, steals the show as he channels Tammy Wynette or is it Loretta Lynn?  My make-up and false eye lashes should look so good!",1482019200,,1108,4.887700534759358

1322473,5,B00003CY27,"Laugh out loud would deb an understatement, if you grew up in the South you know several of the characters in the show by name.

1322514,4,B00003CY27,Saw the live place first and it was not quite as serious as the movie. The movie has quite a few zany characters and many places to smile but also tells a good story about the pains of coming out as a gay person. Very well done.,1472515200,,228,3.872340425531915

1322758,2,B00003CY27,"Don't know where they got the pic for the ad here, since it surely doesn't have much to do with the movie. I can't see why folks are rating this as high as it is, because it's SO low budget. You see the mic boom swing across the top of the screen, see shadows moving when there's only one actor in the scene, etc. The humor is pretty good, but the story line goes beyond picking on ""white trash"" (what a racist term, as if any other races are automatically assumed to be trash??) to the point of farce. I didn't even recognize Olivia Newton-John, except for her voice, which hasn't changed since ""Grease."" Still soothingly sweet. Bottom line is that unless you want to completely release your grip on reality, this film just takes it too far out there. If you're looking for a gay movie (what I'd searched for) with some quality, this one just isn't it.",1457827200,,853,4.371069182389937

The characters are all insane, but mostly in an annoying, over-the-top, self-centered way.

Men are bad... Women are worse... And anybody that doesn't fit neatly into those two categories (man or woman) are highly enlightened and unrelentingly tortured.

1323535,5,B00003CY27,"I bought this movie as a gift for a special friend. I'd seen this several times, and it gets funnier each time I watch it! I especially like Leslie Jordan and Delta Burke, but the rest of the cast is just as good. Who would think of Olivia Newton-John as a gum smacking lesbian? Who but someone with the experience would think of a character with a rubber band on her wrist that she snaps when she wants a cigarette? Then there is Leslie as ""Brother-Boy"" as Tammy Wynette in drag and he is being treated by an oversexed therapist who wants to write a book about cureing him. No matter how you approach the story, the more you say, the funnier it gets. Although Leslie, in drag, is a primary character, the main story revolves around Beau Bridges and his artificial legs.

Her name was Nadine and she lived across the street. As for the pill popping, that would be Brenda. She always had a pill bottle with her and she washed them down with her special ""sodies"". I now know that her sodas were in fact beer. My own mother drove a big ole Caddy with a pistol under the seat. They all had big hair and used one cigarette to light another one. My dad was a local farmer and my mom worked beside him on that farm. She used to haul the rice to the mill in a grain truck. She was a sight! She wore big jewelery, huge dark sunglasses- "" They help with crow's feet hon."". She had big hair and she would have a big, colorful designer scarf over it. She loved her pedal pushers and kitten heeled shoes too. in the series, there was an incident with a pet goat named Billy. We had a pet goat named Billy too.

By far one of the best series I have seen in a very long time! I thought I would check out the movie, which itself is very funny, however, I personally just liked the series better. I felt that after seeing the TV series first (which was filmed after the movie released, but set before the movie) the original movie was a bit of a let down. Like I stated before... the movie is still VERY funny, but I just enjoyed the series a little more.

This movie is not meant for all ages, but rather an older crowd with a sense of dark humor. With a lot of racy comments, jokes, and dark humor all focusing around a ""white trash"" family with their odd quirks addictions and the gay nephew, this movie is definitely not for everyone.

Delta Burke is just hilarious and I laugh whenever I think about her, this is supposed to be a dark movie about southern white trash, but I think it crosses that line and is of interest to a long list of Other types of viewing audiences.

Olivia Newton-John is stellar in her performance as a character type that is the complete opposite of any others I've seen her do.

Beau Bridges is, as always, perfectly immersed in the character he is playing.

And Leslie Jordan as ""Brother Boy"" is a completely unexpected jewel.

Having grown up in a small town and being forced to attend a frightened small church, I have zero trouble relating to Writer-Director Del Shores' experiences in Winters, Texas, as he was raised by a Baptist minister and his wife. I understand the looks, words, idioms, diction, inflections and phrases of many of the characters. And, the characters run from a son who escaped to L.A. to the family's upstanding, never-been-to-a-bar matriarch and the male, cross-dressing Tammy Wynette impersonator in the family - the latter of which is currently in a mental institution for said mania...and has been there for twenty-three years!  The other locals well, are just as funny as  - and his/her actions about as unbelievable - as the other.  The cheating married folk (and how they cheat) along with an accidental death (and how it happens) will knock you winding.

The movie is like a play, (it was a successful play before it was a movie), so my advice is to pay attention to each word and nuance, beginning with the opening bar scene (spliced with interloping bits in a shrink's office and Bitsy Mae Harling's theme song).  The humor/diaglogue is played very flat-out, just like the true life banter you'd experience if you headed down some state highway's ""scenic route"" instead of an interstate and stuck your head inside a few local businesses.  After my first two back-to-back viewings (taped a few years ago via pay-per-view), I would be going about my business and suddenly recall a scene and laugh so hard I would have to stop my vehicle or find a restroom as I was bursting with the best kind of joyful laughter. You will adopt lines from this film as your own and share them in person, on the phone and in e-mails with friends who have been enchanted by this crazy film.  I happily snapped up the DVD later with the great, edited-in extras, worth every penny.

Don't miss it!  And, if you love it like the many fans do, don't miss Sordid Lives: The Series, first season already aired and soon on DVD.  Green Acres fans can simply think of it as Hooterville With Hormones.",1231891200,,2311,4.637254901960785

1324460,4,B00003CY27,"Last night I sat down with a glass of wine, turned on the DVD of SORDID LIVES and had an enjoyable time watching this sensitive, emotional and soulful movie. I didn't know exactly what to expect after reading on the artwork 'A Black Comedy about White Trash' albeit I soon found out that's exactly what it was. The ensemble cast worked very well with each other and delivered some crackling dialogue made possible by the writer, Del Shores. I loved lines like: ""you got as big as a bus and who the hell wants to climb a mountain"" and in the Thelma and Louise sequence: ""what did I do?"" and the reply ""you're living and you're breathing.""

It was nice to see Olivia Newton-John (one of my countrymen - or should that be women) with that amazing Texas accent. She has come a long way since the days of Grease. I could associate with so many of the characters in this story as they reminded me of so many who had passed through my life at one time or another.

The lead up to (extracting the fox fur) and the funeral would have to be worth the price of this DVD alone. Tragic as it might be Grandma lying there in the coffin and everyone revealing their thoughts was a joy. One almost expected Grandma to come alive again. On that note make sure you watch right through to after the end credits for a real surprise.

The performance of Ty(played by Kirk Geiger) and the sensitivity with which he delivered his lines brought a tear to my eyes as it did his. Somewhere in all this I could feel similar emotions which I had encountered over the years. Where is Kirk Geiger today? It seems he has dropped off the face of the earth after this performance as he is not in the same role in the TV series. From what I can ascertain (after checking imdb) he was portraying a much younger character than what he really was. On that note if anyone has further details on what he might be doing I would certainly appreciate knowing.

To conclude I must mention the Art Direction which I found to be extremely striking. It appeared a great deal of thought was put into  coloring and design, especially the beautiful paintings in the therapists office) and worked so well with the blending of the costumes

1324579,2,B00003CY27,"Sordid Lives is like many films that have attained ""cult"" status in that it's an awkward, ungainly production whose devotees embrace it for the very elements that mainstream audiences might consider flaws.

The story is simple and straightforward, and the characters are potentially interesting, but they most seem two-dimensional. Beau Bridges is wasted on a drunk buffoon who's never really funny or given much to do. Bonnie Bedelia fares better as the prissy mom of the narrating character, because she chooses to play the part straight instead of broad. Even when she's being ridiculous, she's far more real than most of the cast, who, while energetic, are often not likable and frequently cartoonish. I suspect this is more about the script and the direction than the actors.

The gay subplot of the film is handled with a surprisingly heavy hand, and while Leslie Jordan's character Brother Boy is played with a certain level of dignity, the part as written is more stereotypical and broad that you'd think. Cooped up in an insane asylum for 23 years, Brother Boy lives vicariously as Loretta Lynn, but it's never clear if he's adopted his country music queen persona as a mechanism for distancing himself from the horrible world he inhabits, if he has gone slightly nuts from his years locked up, or both. The story takes a cheap way out by having him confronted by a psychologist who's clearly the biggest but in the booby hatch. The character of Ty, who narrates the story from his therapist's office, is bland, and for every story he tells that feels real and touches a nerve, there's something else that feels worn and retreaded. Ty never seems to be connected to the world he describes.

There's fun and funny stuff here, but the morals are heavy handed, and the story tries too hard to be outrageous, often resulting in forced comedy.

That this film is adapted from a play is readily apparent and all too obvious. I've not seen the play, but its fingerprint are all over the film: the staging and the dialogue and the fact that the whole story plays out in essentially four locations (house, mental hospital, bar and church) all point out this origin in really obvious ways. The thing takes place in essentially four scenes, and while intercut, it's still obviously four scenes. Those scenes would have been better off subdivided into smaller scenes and played in different locations.

Worst of all the technical execution is terrible. Apparently being one of the first indies shot on high def video, the film has a weird flat quality that isn't helped by amateurish lighting schemes where actors actually step into key lights of their fellow performers, casting them in shadows. The camera work itself is shaky and the setup and angles are often clumsy. The deleted scenes on the DVD demonstrate how bad this work can be, as some of the deleted material is so poorly photographed that one suspects it was dropped for its lack of visual quality as opposed to its narrative effectiveness.

In a way, the TV series spawned from it is better than the film itself,  because it's written in bite-size scenes suited to television and film.",1222992000,2,3147,4.838289962825279

We know we can't choose our relatives and aren't we glad someone else has this group?  White Trailer Trash may not be apropos for this collection of oddities because these people are so damn funny. Don't think their intention is to be funny, but they are all just a little bit left of center. They are living their lifestyles or not, but they are doing this in their own way.

The beginning of the movie starts at a slow pace but soon builds to a crescendo that will have you laughing til your sides hurt.  Sissy Hickey is on the phone discussing the demise of her sister. A rather unfortunate incident of tripping over the wooden legs of her married lover in a third rate motel. Now, her daughter, Latrelle played by Bonnie Bedelia, and Noletta, Sissy's neighbor, played by Delta Burke, are arguing over whether mom should be buried in her fur wrap in the middle of summer.  This done over a table full of southern fried food sent in by neighbors.  The talk turns to  Noletta's husband, the lover with the wooden legs, mom's son-in-law. And then turns to Brother Boy  their younger bro, who dresses in women's clothing and has spent the past 20 years in the insane asylum. Latrelle's son is in Hollywood and acting in gay plays.  The curious incident of the wooden legs has made the family a laughing stock and how to deal with this?

In the meantime Brother Boy  and his psychiatrist, Dr Eve Bolinger, are undergoing his therapy. Dr Bolinger is going to cure Brother Boy  of his homosexuality and make her so famous she will appear on Oprah. However Brother Boy is not cooperating, He does not want to change. So, there appears to be a stand-off.

The problems of each family member and the collective are enough to make a grown man cry. However, in this case, we may be down on our knees gasping from our laughter. How this family comes together is a mystery and the country western singer, played by Olivia Newton John , sings the family back home.  Not a laugh a minute but funny enough to keep us all off-base.

""Like a live-action version of ""King of the Hill"" in hyperdrive,  features some ornery down-homers who remain convinced of their common sense even when every move puts them in deeper doo-doo. The doo-doo that they do so well is adultery, with the latest round of musical beds in the tale's unnamed small town having resulted in the death of old Peggy, who tripped over the misplaced wooden legs of her married lover, G.W. (Beau Bridges)."" Ken Eisner

Adding to the movie's plus side is the man playing Ty, the super cute Kirk Geiger.  Sadly, the movie is very obviously low budget.  Early on, I was a bit bothered by the seeming hand-held camera video quality, but I was soon won over by the power of the performances and the entertaining and ridiculous story, which is well written.  This is a movie that is definitely worth seeing.  (For those who delight in catching errors, there's at least one flub in the actual cinematography, when a microphone is reflected in a picture hanging on the wall.  )",1201996800,,689,4.691666666666666
1324739,5,B00003CY27,"SORDID LIVES opens with a singer at a microphone, a woman with bleached hair that shows black roots, several tattoos, and stragetically placed chewing gum as she rehearses a profanity-laced juke joint song.  She looked familiar--and when she sang her voice was even more so.  Who on earth was she?  My jaw dropped with a clatter.  Oh My God.  It can't be!  But yes, it is.  That really is Olivia Newton-John!

Written by Del Shores, SORDID LIVES was a popular ticket and award-winning comedy on the Los Angeles stage, but when Shores sought a movie deal every studio turned him down flat.  Shores presevered nonetheless, and the result was an awkwardly self-directed, extremely low budget movie filmed in high definition that had the look of a cheap 1960s soap opera.  Surprisingly, though, these qualities actually suited the material: a torrid, vulgar, trashy, and unexpectedly spiritual tale of a small-town Texas funeral gone to pot in the most disastrous ways imaginable.

The plot is difficult to describe, but it revolves around a ""good Christian"" grandmother who has died under unsavory circumstances: shacked up with a neighbor's husband in a cheap motel, she tripped over her lover's wooden legs and cracked her head on the bathroom sink! Now her lover G.W. (Beau Bridges) is getting drunk down at the bar while her daughters Latrelle and Lavonda (Bonnie Bedelia and Ann Walker) bicker with each other over the funeral arrangements--and whether or not Brother-Boy (Leslie Jordan) should be allowed to come to the funeral from the mental hospital where he has been locked up for twenty-three years because he thinks he's Tammy Wynette.

The film is a hair slow to get underway, but once it does it goes off like a rocket.  There's G.W.'s humiliated wife Noleta (Delta Burke), an aging barfly named Juanita (Sarah Hunley), the psychiatrist from hell (Rosemay Alexander), angst-ridden gay grandson Ty (Kurt Geiger), bar owner Wardell (Newell Alexander) and his half-wit brother Odell (Earl H. Bullock)--and the aforementioned ex-con and juke-joint singer Bitsy Mae (Newton-John.)  And it is clear that each and every one of them are having a wonderful time tearing strips off the wickedly funny script, which offers one outrageous line and scene after another.

For all the talent on display--Delta Burke, Kirk Geiger, and Bonnie Bedelia are particularly memorable--the big noise is actress Beth Grant, who is probably best known for her turn in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.  Cast here as Sissy, sister to the dead woman, she is everything that is appallingly funny: snapping a rubber band on her wrist because she's trying to quit smoking, fanning herself up the legs of her shorts, and trying to make peace in the family before everbody meets up at the church for funerial hysteria.  Her performance is one-of-a-kind and knock-you-flat at the same time.

The DVD comes with several extras, including cut scenes and an enjoyable audio commentary.  I'm not all that fond of contemporary comedy--I usually find it both sterile and saccharine--but I tell you here and now: SORDID LIVES, for all its flaws, made me laugh until I cried.

1324815,5,B00003CY27,"Describing the story of SORDID LIVES is almost like running blindfolded through a labyrinth- the deeper you get into it, the more twisted it becomes. Here's the abridged version, and be sure to stop me if you've heard this before: Grandma Peggy has met an untimely end after having fallen over her lover's wooden legs. Her big-haired, foul-mouthed daughters descend upon their nicotine-deprived Aunt's sweltering trailer to plan the funeral and eat fried chicken, as the trailer park neighbor from hell (Delta Burke) makes a living out of disturbing the peace by brandishing her tongue and her 6-shooter. Throw in the arrival of a [...] actor son from Los Angeles, a country singer wannabe, and ""Brother Boy"" who believes he is the saintly reincarnation of Tammy Wynette, and you have all the makings of a white trash car wreck that you can't help but watch in utter disbelief. This is the stuff that SORDID LIVES is made of.

What makes SORDID LIVES such a gem of a movie is the fact that these are real people in unreal situations. Each one of us knows at LEAST one of the characters in this film, and while the storyline is so over the top that you may need oxygen, the characterizations are beautifully written, skillfully directed, and ring true down to the most minute detail.
In the hands of lesser actors, this movie could easily have descended into sitcom hell, but this ensemble cast is, in a word, perfection. Delta Burke sheds her Designing Women persona for a much more multi-layered performace as the jilted wife, while Kirk Geiger's [...] actor son portrayal is both understated and a perfect foil to his trailer park Aunts. Beau Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia, and Olivia Newton-John are all outrageously running amuk in their chacterizations, yet Beth Grant as the jumpy Aunt who just quit smoking, and Leslie Jordan as the Tammy Wynette Drag Queen, ""Brother Boy"" steal this movie.

If you are not from the south--due to a tragedy of birth location--you might not relate to the characters.  To to deal with life--and death--you need humor, and this movie provides it.  As a southerner, or hillbilly, which is more appropriate in my case--this movie is a prime example of the things we confront at a sudden death, and the concepts that it deals with.  If you can't laugh, you are not alive.  We celebrate life and death with humor and this movie is a prime example of life, death, and the problems that both cause.

Now, I'm not a hard guy to make laugh, but there was only one point in this film where I actually laughed out loud. Other than that, I found Sordid Lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced.

I love Southern humor and even poking fun at Southerners: I can't tell you how much I love Greater Tuna, Fried Green Tomatos, Steel Magnolias, etc. but this just didn't cut it for me.

The cast is a who's who of excellent character actors: Beau Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia, Leslie Jordan, Olivia Newton-John (for pete's sake!), Erik Krieger, Delta Burke and gobs of others. No, it's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks. I found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once.

There's a scene with Ty (an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in West Hollywood) talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist...well, as a theatre director, I can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them.

There are various filming techniques that Del Shores (the director) uses that are just hackneyed: filming from behind a person's back so that only the back of one person's head and the facing person are seen. Why? It feels like a testimonial ""video"" from MTV's Real World rather than an actual film.

Frankly - and this is not always a bad thing - the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film. It can be a great thing! Look at Altmans' Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean and you'll see how a good stage to film movie is done. But this...well, it's just amateur hour from my perspective.

In all, the film felt like a poor man's Greater Tuna (two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in Texas' 3rd smallest town), which WAS a stage play and WAS filmed for HBO as a stage play rather than attempting to make it FEEL like a film.

When you watch the movie, you instantly recognize the poeple, (maybe it helps being from a small or southern town) as people you come into contact with on a daily basis.  It's just that their characteristics have been exaggerated to protect the innocent. :)  They're just very human, making jokes in the face of tragedy, just like everyone else does, trying to deal with their cracker jacks prize.

It's a movie that will make you laugh, then cry, but then laugh again, with the perfect mix of comedy, irreverence, and subtle prodding of prevailing social attitudes.

Many people, for example, tend to appreciate that New York brand of comedy, like you would find on Seinfeld. Others tend to like a more slapstick variety like something Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder would come up with. Still there is the dry wit type such as Charlie Sheen. I go into this because I want to make a point that SORDID LIVES is not the kind of humor everyone will appreciate and for a good review, it should be qualified as to just what type of audience would like it. Personally, I don't remember very many movies that made me laugh as much as this one.

This comedy would fall under the genre of redneck, white trash, hick, small town Texas, trailer trash or any such other similar descriptions. Let me put it this way, if you would find it hilarious to watch an old bar tramp putting on her lipstick without removing the cigarette from her mouth, then by all means, buy this movie!

We are subjected to a seemingly endless array of gay themed movies these days, and I don't normally like any of them, but here it is presented in a mockingly hysterical fashion as one is trying to stay in the closet, another comes to the realization of his gayness, and a third is being treated by a semi-psychotic therapist who is willing to go to any length to cure him of it. Also, anyone who has ever endured the agony of quitting smoking will die laughing watching dear old Aunt Sissy struggle with her addiction.

This movie is brilliantly cast. The filming, which looks almost like it was shot with a home movie camera, adds ambience to this film. I wouldn't normally like that type of filming, but here, it is a perfect fit. This is a hysterically funny movie that, if you appreciate this kind of humor, will have your sides hurting.

Those, who write the film off as ""silly"" or ""amateurish"", are missing the point.

She is survived by a sister who has just stopped smoking three days before this untimely death and will not be able to stay on the wagon. Peggy has two daughters with large hair, a son whom she has banished to a mental institution 23 years ago because he is a cross-dresser-- and is in love with Tammy Wynette-- and a  gay grandson who has fled Texas for a more tolerant Los Angeles. Most of this two hour often over-the-top comedy involves how these family members get ready for the funeral.

The movie apparently was made on a shoestring-- sometimes it shows it-- but for the most part it works, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud. Example l: the scene with Brother Boy (Leslie Jordan) and his shrink who is trying to deprogram him and make him straight. His only positive sign of improvement is that he is able to walk down the hall without his wig. He flunks royally the rest of the procedure. Example 2: When the two daughters of the deceased to their Thelma and Louise routine.

The details are right on target from the casserole dish that would have the name of the cook taped on the bottom-- so she can get her dish back after the funeral-- to the kitchen curtains to the hymnal on the upright piano.

A lot of fine actors signed on for this production: Beau bridges, Delta Burke, Olivia Newton-John, Leslie Jordan, Bonnie Bedelia et al.

Like most comedies there is the overly dramatic moment or two when the characters have their ""AHA"" moments, but overall this is a gas with some slapstick moments, but mostly very clever asides and dialogue.  Some of the staging is as much a part of the story as the characters.  E.g. my mother-in-law is southern ""country folk"" (her words) and always has a food sitting out.

Leslie Jordan steals the show as crossdressing, institution-bound ""Brother Boy"".  His portrayal of Tammy Wynette is over the top and his therapy sessions are outrageously hysterical.  The soundtrack is filled with Wynette's songs and original music performed by Olivia Newton John, who portrays a convict turned country lounge singer in the film.

Some of these folks look, act, and sound exactly like some of my more colorful southern relatives.  It looks like they really put their heart into this project.

However, there are some really slow parts, and sometimes the humor crosses over into the unimaginable (i.e. going over the top) and the story loses some of its credibility and therefore some of its humor.  The story could have been tightened up on the editing room floor and the end product would have been funnier.  (Think Designing Women with a few too many long scenes that go out of control; Linda Bloodworth-Thomason knew when to make a point, or a joke, and then move on.)

However, if you gloss over some relatively minor flaws, you will surely laugh out loud more than once and probably enjoy the hilarious tongue-in-cheek songs by Olivia Newton-John.

While both the son and the uncle (perfectly hysterical, by the way) are wonderfully acted, it is the women who steal the show.  Mostly done in a conversational style of acting, their bantering, gossiping, and chemistry with each other is both reminiscent of your own southern women in your life and make-ya-laugh-unitl-you-can't-breath funny.

Playful and apt references to other films in the public consciousness (Thelma and Louise, for example) latched onto surrealistic spoofs of southern/country culture (Tammy Wynette in drag) in highly amusing ways.  Yet, there is an air of confessional (the gay son, the proud mother, the cheating husband, the redneck boyfriend) that lends an air of authority and truth to the film.  While it is something that ""could never be"" it is simultaneously something that ""is every day.""

In short, the writing is good and the acting is superlative.  If you are able to step back and look at yourself and your neighbor and laugh - at least at the deviance - then this is a film for you.",1101686400,,835,4.639455782312925

The actors are fabulous, especially Leslie Jordan as 'Brother Boy' Earl.  Far from playing the role in typical drag queen camp, Jordan brings depth and even poignancy to his (hilarious) character, who copes with his hellish looney bin existence by living out vicariously the life of Tammy Wynette.  Beth Grant is also sensational in her protracted nicotine fit.
I've seen enough of mega-studio Hollywood not to mind the fresh, offbeat, low-budget feel of this film.  The big-name talent certainly delivers, including, as musical backdrop, Olivia Newton-John's awesome guitar numbers (impressively sung live on camera--wow what a talent, she's still got it).
Apart from uproarious laughs, the film offers a meaningful theme of the dysfunctionality that non-acceptance from DENIAL can inject into family relationships.  Be sure to add 'Sordid Lives' to your DVD collection, because it's becoming a cult classic of white trash humor--and memorable lines from the film are starting to go around.

Oliva, who I have always been a fan of seems stranded in a seperate movie until the last scene and the rest of the actors seemed to have been told to chew up scenery at every turn.

I can count the ones I like in the last 10 years on my fingers and have some digits left over. Hurrah for Del Shores, his cast and crew. I can believe that everyone on the set had a great time and laughed a lot. Beau Bridges was quite funny as the lover of the Ingram's clans mother. who stumbles over Bridges wooden legs after an affair in a motel and dies, morbid, not by a long shot. The laughs get better. Delta Burke is superb as the jilted wife and has lost mucho weight since ""Designing Women."" But, the Oscar goes to Leslie Jordan, (Earl Brother Boy, Ingram) who has been sent to the loony bin to have him straightened out. His scenes with hi therapist is so funny I actually cried I laughed so hard, and his closing scene at the funeral is beyond belief.
Folks if you missed this one the first go round, please for your own sake rent it, buy it, you will not be sorry. This film is rated fff for funny, funny, funny. But if you are one of those tight lipped southerners who cannot laugh at the wild side of life, stay far away.

As if Sissy doesn't have problems enough in the wake of five failed marriages, she's struggling to quit smoking, popping Valium like candy, and having to cope with the dysfunctions of assorted family members. Niece Latrelle (Bonnie Bedelia), whose husband is off with Jimmy Carter building homes for the poor, is in denial over the homosexuality of son Ty (Kirk Geiger), an aspiring actor out in L.A., and contesting the decision of her sister LaVonda (Ann Walker) to clothe Mom in her favorite mink stole for the burial in 110-degree Texas heat. Meanwhile, Peggy's son Earl (Leslie Jordan), a homosexual transvestite, has been confined to a mental institution for the past twenty years. Out in SoCal, Ty is suffering a sexual identity crisis, and is on his twenty-seventh therapist.

Jordan is positively superb as Earl, who spends his life dressed up as CW singer Tammy Wynette, and has a permanent gig entertaining his fellow inmates in the asylum.
Also exceptional is Rosemary Alexander as the sexually frustrated Dr. Eve Bolinger, the institution psychologist assigned to Earl's case. Eve's career, as well as a lucrative book deal and an appearance on Oprah, are all dependent on her ability to successfully de-homosexualize her charge. Therapy has not progressed well after sixty-eight sessions, and Eve is prepared to take Earl's problem in hand, so to speak. The single, on-screen session between Earl and his shrink is brilliantly scripted and worth the price of the video rental, and then some.
A very nice touch is Olivia Newton-John as Bitzy Mae Harling, an ex-con and local bad girl, whose timely live performance of topical songs augments recorded Tammy Wynette vocals. Delta Burke as Noleta, G.W.'s unhappy spouse, is also effective, as is Sissy's striking hairdo.
Sometimes, the film's humor becomes shrill and a little forced. For that reason,  I'm lopping off a fifth star. However, though SORDID LIVES is perhaps not suitable for screening at a Southern Baptist potluck, it's one that may offer a pleasant surprise if selected off the rental store shelf as a ""well, why not?"" afterthought.",1062288000,35,2553,5.137019230769231
1325317,5,B00003CY27,"This is such a well acted comedy about small town folk with big time gossip and disfunctional families!
Beth Grant is a hoot as all the characters are!
I've watched this movie so many times and every time I laugh harder!
I don't give many movies my wink, but this one deserves cudo's for laughs and fun!
It never recieved wide release (such a shame, it would have been a blockbuster)!
Buy this movie, you will love it!",1061769600,,418,4.371794871794871

Bonnie Bedelia, Beau Bridges, Delta Burke and Olivia Newton-John(in a mostly singing role as Bitsy Mae Harling) head the cast with really great performances!  Beth Grant is a total standout as ""Sissy"", the sister of the deceased(Peggy, who died after tripping over her lovers wooden legs)....she's ""TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING"" and will make you laugh your rear-end off!  Leslie Jourdan is a total hoot as ""Brother Boy"".......his therapy scenes with Rosemary Alexander are INSANELY funny.....
This movie is not a family film and contains adult themes.....but if you like a good laugh and dark comedy..this is one for you.......not for the conservative.......",1059350400,5,799,5.234375
1325319,5,B00003CY27,"I absolutely loved this movie and think it should be required viewing by everyone! It speaks volumes about  placing labels on people that unfortunately we all have done to one degree or another. I have watched this movie several times and each time I get a better insight of the different characters and it motivates me to try and be a better person. I laugh hard and cry hard every time I watch this movie.  While it is a movie that has a ""gay"" character and a ""crossdresser"" it is more importantly about how not dealing with situations in our lives and any issues we may have can lead us into a life of never being able to be totally honest with ourselves or anyone else.",1054598400,,673,4.333333333333333

Operative word, great!  So much humor, and as a prior reviewer mentioned is a bit dated, but who cares about that!  Trash should be dated!  I'd recommend this to anyone, we borrowed it to view, and are about to purchase our own.  Better watch it!",1054339200,2,405,4.063291139240507
1325321,4,B00003CY27,"Admittedly gay audiences may find this film more interesting than straight ones being that two of the main characters are gay.  However there is a universal theme that runs throughout the film, that is now matter how screwed up, unusual or inapproachable we may seem on the outside we are all part of one family.  It doesn't mean we get along all the time, in fact it may be quite the opposite most of the time.  It just means that we sometimes have to look below the surface of what we see, or to accept what we don't understand instead of hating it.  Some Southerners may find this movie mocking, while others may find it humourously on target.  The film could've been set in rural Ohio or the upper midwest with the same types of characters, just different accents, so the setting should be neither a selling point nor a reason to avoid the film.  It plays like a series of short stories all ties together by musical interludes, and the acting is outstanding, as exagerrated as it is.",1054339200,,987,4.4860335195530725
1325322,2,B00003CY27,"Although produced in 1999, this film seems to come from a much earlier era.  The homes, fashions, and concerns are so dated that the occasional semi-contemporary references (such as to Oprah or ""Thelma and Louise"") are jarring.  Perhaps the writer expects us to believe that contemporary Texas is stuck in such a time warp, with no cable tv, no vcrs, no convenience stores, and a cast of characters who consume tuna casseroles and fight over mink stoles.
One of the characters, a drag queen named ""Brother Boy,"" has been in a mental institution for 23 years, undergoing ""de-homosexualization"" therapy.  Someone needed to consult a copy of the DSM, which removed ""homosexuality"" as a therapeutic condition in 1973 -- long before he got there. The evil psychotherapist believes that her de-homosexualization technique (it involves thinking about women while you. . .you know) will make her rich and famous.  It will only get her kicked out of the APA.  And transvestism has never been grounds for institutionalization.
Another character has moved to Los Angeles because he ""couldn't be who is"" in Texas. He's  never heard of the huge gay communities in Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio?  Evidently they do not exist, as even in L.A. he has had to undergo 27 years of psychotherapy and long periods of dating women before ""accepting himself.""  He agonizes over coming out even to his friends in the hip L.A. theater community.  They accept it -- big surprise -- so he goes home to Texas and informs Mom, who just wants to know if he's ""the man"" or ""the woman.""
If this film were set in 1963, I could buy it, but not in 2003.  The producers have evidently been living in complete ignorance of the progress gay persons have made since Stonewall -- since, indeed, they are under the impression that Stonewall never happened.",1053734400,3,1826,4.861290322580645
1325333,2,B00003CY27,"Did audiences really need another gay-is-okay shrill-fest--particularly one that brands fundamentalist Southerners as stupid and silly for their resistance to the movie's message?  As humorous as is Leslie Jordan's cross-dresser portrayal, it quickly becomes apparent that most of the fun being poked is aimed at his hillbilliness and not his swishiness.  The only character presented as normal is a Texas-born hollywood gay whose acting in nude, homoerotic productions is treated as artistic--while the implication is that the homefolk are low-brow and ill-bred.  Yet, half the characters show no sign of sordidness, and some are straight-laced and preachily moralistic.  About white trash this movie aint.  It's about everyday rural people whose actions and comments are--as in real life--occasionally funny.  But the film's theme turns it all into a propaganda piece that is long in the tooth and longer in the telling.",1053561600,2,922,5.55
1325334,4,B00003CY27,"There are only three things you need to know:
1. Olivia Newton-John. The song begins with the opening credits. You're rockin' along, loving the lyrics, and all of a sudden the visual of Olivia N-J in country biker drag - complete with a rose tatoo on her right breast and a bad hairdon't - fill the screen.  It is an awesome sight.
2. Beth Grant.  The face, the hair, the delivery - sheer perfection. Talk about inhabiting a role! It just can't get any better than this.
3. Leslie Jordan. It just got better. This is the best performance I have seen in any film in years.  And I have seen a lot. Mr. Jordan's every move, every utterance is staggering.  I am not lying. This performance alone is worth whatever trouble you encounter finding the DVD to rent (try Netflix).
The writing is, by turns, inspired and insipid. When it's good, it is phenomenal. When it's bad, just press fast forward. The soundtrack is great the art direction is flawless, the acting on the whole ain't bad.
In sum, the three things you now know makes Sordid Lives a film well worth viewing, despite its flaws.
Trust me on this one.",1052870400,7,1107,4.465346534653466
1325335,1,B00003CY27,"I don't know where to start with how godawful this movie is! First there's the ""direction"" or lack thereof. Then there's the script, which just wasn't funny, especially when compared to the riotous humor of ""Greater Tuna"" and it's sequels, which poke fun at small-town Texas life without belittling EVERY SINGLE character! Oh, and then there's the embarassing star turns from Beau Bridges, Delta Burke, Bonnie Bedilia, etc. Olivia Newton-John's character was superfluous; she just seemed to show up to sing a song, then leave. The lesser known actors should look for another line of work because they were just too sad for words, esp. the psychiatrist and the prerequisite ""young closeted actor."" The few standouts were Beth Grant who truly inhabited her character and Leslie Jordan who was much funnier in, well just about every other thing he's ever done in his career. This movie is offensive to Texans, Southerners, gays, straights, the living and the dead. And it's especially offensive to anyone who had to pay a dime to view it.
Do yourself a favor: find a copy of ""Greater Tuna"" or ""Tuna Christmas"" to see how truly hilarious small town Texas life can be where the writing, direction, and especially the acting are far superior than this Lone Star dud.",1050796800,6,1260,4.92018779342723
1325336,5,B00003CY27,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie with a gentleman from a small Texas town who told ME, that this movie was not only one of the most hysterical movies he'd seen but so true to life.

1325337,2,B00003CY27,"I watched this movie on a friend's--very qualified--recommendation.  It was, he admitted, low brow humor, but it was full of great one-liners and wacky situations.  There were a couple of laugh-out-loud lines, true, but actually, my friend had already pretty much quoted them all before I got a chance to view the film. And even the best lines get lost admid the overall noise in this poorly paced, inconsistently directed and horribly photographed effort.  A talented cast, including Bonnie Bedelia, Beau Bridges, Delta Burke, Beth Grant and many others, can't really save the film.  The best moments belong to the film's gay characters (played by Leslie Jordan and Kirk Geiger, and a surprisingly effective Olivia Newton-John).  They manage to preserve a little dignity throughout the loopy proceedings.  The other, ""straight"" characters are way too archly drawn for the actors to be able to work with.  They do their valiant best, but they're stuck with caricatures instead of characters. Admittedly, they look like they're having fun, at least.

1325339,5,B00003CY27,"I first saw Sordid Lives at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival back in the Summer of 2001 and it was the audience hit of the festival. My friends and I thought sure it would be released in the art house theaters..and we waited...and waited...and were quite surprised that it seemed to just disappear (although I did hear it was quite a hit in Palm Springs, CA and a few other theaters around the country ).
So I patiently waited for it to come out on DVD and I am happy to say that it is just as funny as I remember. It has many, many laugh-out-loud moments and the entire cast is great. However, Leslie Jordan as Brother Boy and Beth Grant as Sissy are standouts and you will be quoting their lines all the time...they are just that good! And the DVD comes with lots of extras for the truly obsessed Sordid Lives fan!

One minute you are laughing uproariously and the next you have tears in your eyes over a touching scene.  I highly recommend this DVD to those of you not fortunate enough to live in Palm Springs and able to see this film.  It has played here for over a year and shows no signs of wearing out its welcome.
