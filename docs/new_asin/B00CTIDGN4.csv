8586079,5,B00CTIDGN4,"This is a must for eazy e fans, I have been a due hard fan of eazy and nwa since the early nineties and have not come across anything as informative and true as this. I read the book by jerry heller called ruthless memories which was ok but he didn't really cover anything that isn't already common knowledge. This has been made by a fellow eazy fan but it doesn't seem biast at all. It's basically a documentary of interviews from people who truly knew him in the early days and outside of the music business, highlights include his former bodyguard, big man, julio g, mc ren, cold 187 and bg knocc out but there are many many more. In fact the running time is nearly 2 hours! So just buy it you won't regret it, an pay full price too to support the filmmaker! Still waiting on part 2 though???? When will this surface??",1405036800,,821,4.269230769230769
8586080,4,B00CTIDGN4,"great documentary about eazy e, pity about the back ground noise when people are talking, but still worth it i watched over and over",1391904000,,132,4.541666666666667
8586081,5,B00CTIDGN4,If you grew up listening to gangster rap especially Eazy -E and NWA then I highly recommend checking this out.  You get a good insight on who Eazy was and that he kept it real with the music he made because he came from the streets.  He deserves a lot more respect and props for what he did for rap which is why he's called the godfather of gangster rap.  Pac and Big made some good albums but Eazy not only made real street music but changed the game when he founded Ruthless.,1390089600,,477,4.10752688172043

8586083,5,B00CTIDGN4,"Ruthless Memories is probably the rawest and most authentic documentary you can see about the origins of gangster rap. The movie shows an in depth, real, and highly personal look into the life of Eric Wright, as told -- not by the usual cast of characters -- but by his real homies in Compton. Obviously it is a must see for fans of Eazy-E, Ruthless Records, ATL, and NWA. But more than that is great documentary for all fans of West Coast Rap, 90's Rap, and Gangster Rap. Eazy's rise and fall, along with Ruthless's many reinventions over the years, paints you a picture of how it all started, how the beefs went down, how it all shook out, and where these real G's are today.

I thought production quality was good for an independent. It has an ominous west coast baseline which is the theme music throughout the documentary. At no point do you ever feel out of Compton when watching it. It is different in that, the interviews are not with the most famous people in rap, but instead with the real G's involved in Eazy's life, the birth of Ruthless, the beefs of Ruthless, and the aftermath.

Very interesting. Good gift. I loved it.",1383004800,,1135,4.478260869565218
