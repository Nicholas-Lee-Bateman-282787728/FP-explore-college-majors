5370933,5,B009XEANH4,"I loved this wonderful South Korean combination horror - comedy - romance film from 2011 called Spellbound (title is Chilling Romance in Korea).

The film stars Ye-Jin Son from The Classic and A Moment To Remember, and Min-Ki Lee from Tidal Wave. Min-kee plays a street magician who is intrigued by a girl (Ye-Jin) who stands and watches his magic act but who never smiles. In fact, she looks miserable all the time. Finally he builds up the courage to follow her and confront her and this leads to a brainstorm in which he builds a stage act magic show based on the netherworld. She is hired to play a ghost in his show but unknown to him she has a real ghost who pursues her and that is why she lives alone and has no friends except for a handful she only talks to on the phone -- she doesn't want to put their lives in jeopardy. The stage show becomes wildly popular. Even though the magician has another girlfriend he finds himself growing closer and closer to the sad woman in his show who plays the ghost.

Sometimes films like these, which try to incorporate layers of both horror, romance, and comedy, simply don't work because the audience becomes confused as to which subject matter is supposed to be dominant. Should they be scared of the ghost, or laugh at it? Does the magician become intrigued by his employee because he is frightened of her, because the entire company laughs at her behind her back, is he concerned for her as a human being, or because he might actually be falling in love with her? This film does work though, partly because it doesn't take itself too seriously, and partly because the actors are just so darn good they'd be convincingly seamless in anything!

Gorgeous Ye-Jin Son does not look one day older in this film from 2011 than she did in 2003's The Classic. She is perfect in this film, especially the unforgettable scene where she finally admits to her phone girl friends how sad and miserable she is living all alone.

It's mind-boggling to me how all these Korean actors never seem to age! It took a bit of time for me to warm to Min-Ki Lee's character, I didn't consider him all that handsome at first, but he grew on me and by the end of the film he looked quite attractive. He was especially good in the comedic scenes.

I love the Korean films and shows because they dare to show the personal growth of characters, often from shallow and selfish, to compassionate and caring. They aren't afraid of sentimentality in their scripts, whereas Hollywood often looks down on it. Who cares about reading subtitles when they open the doors to exceptional films like this one! What delights Americans are missing!",1385856000,9,2654,4.555555555555555
5370934,5,B009XEANH4,"South Korea has owned romance in film since the mid-nineties, creating a lovely genre of tender romanticism untouched by Hollywood or any other country producing films. It has also created a unique genre in horror films, and action films, both often remade by Hollywood but not nearly as well-done. With South Korea's romance genre, both the tender and poignant films, and the romantic comedies, Hollywood doesn't even try, and that's just as well, because the sensitivity and romanticism so deftly displayed in South Korean films no longer exists within Hollywood's film industry, at least as a whole.

In this tremendously charming and engaging offering starring the marvelous Son Ye-jin, romantic comedy is surprisingly melded with supernatural horror with results both hilarious and tender. This is a testament to just how entertaining and well-made South Korea's films are, that two diametrically opposed genres could be so wonderfully blended together and produce such a lovely afterimage for those lucky enough to view this film.

In this film, a nerdy, struggling magician becomes a huge success after being entranced by a morbid girl attending one of his shows. She proves the key to his success, his otherworldly stage act fueled by her very real struggles with seeing the dead. But as with all South Korean films, her story is much more involved, and much more poignant than the viewer or the young magician initially understands. It is this haunting of her that makes it nearly impossible for her to be close to anyone, including her family, and especially, the young magician, who although he has a girlfriend, finds himself attracted to her.

Son Ye-jin's terrific performance as a girl forced to live like a ghost gives this film its tenderness, most prominently in a very poignant scene on the phone where she breaks down and admits just how terribly lonely she truly is. Not to be outdone, however, Min-ki Lee has an almost equally moving breakdown across the phone in a last-second attempt to keep his love from leaving him. One does not expect from these descriptions of the film for it to be so truly and utterly hilarious, but it is. This is also a romantic comedy, a light and playful tone sustained all the way through the belly-laughs of the closing credits. Most of the humor revolves around the reactions to the very horrific situations, which eventually threaten both halves of the romantic-bound duo.

There is as much warmth as there is charm in this marvelous confection from South Korea, and just as many laughs. This is just about as perfect as a light romance can get, but it is the uniquely South Korean ingredients of romanticism and longing for love that make it an unmissable film for those who enjoy romantic comedies with a heart, and a few creepy scares. A must-see for romantics.",1385856000,6,2820,4.943037974683544
5370935,4,B009XEANH4,"She looks like a warmed over ghost, never smiling, never interacting  with any  one.  Yet she makes him a star in the horror show he produces.  Their relationship is a juggling contest  of words and events and other worldly slightly out of kilter but falling ever closer as her past is revealed.  If  you like word play, don't miss this one.",1381104000,3,341,4.491803278688525

5370937,5,B009XEANH4,"First, the seller (timothyng001) happens to live in my city. She was great in providing personal communication as the DVD shipped all the way across town. ""Spellbound"" was really entertaining with a captivating storyline, original plot, nice production, and good acting (especially my favorite, Son Ye Jin). My wife and I enjoyed this Korean comedy with a story that hung together. The subtitling was well done and kept the story flowing smoothly. I highly recommend this film, especially for Son Ye Jin fans.",1368316800,13,509,5.144578313253012

This product: This product is not an All region DVD as the description states, it's region 3, so only purchase it if you have a region 3 or all region dvd player. It will NOT play in standard US DVD players.",1365552000,23,333,4.338709677419355

After many attempts at trying to get the movie to play, I checked the DVD case and saw that it was a region 3 DVD only. I was not pleased, but still feel that I am unable to rate it fairly since I didn't even get to watch the movie itself.

I did receive the DVD in a timely manner and the product was in excellent condition.",1357689600,6,500,3.9019607843137254

5370943,5,B009XEANH4,"Others are writing that this DVD doesn't work in their player - but it played fine in my Blu-ray player? I will say this about the product itself - I'm pretty sure whoever wrote the English subtitles either didn't understand English well enough or didn't understand Korean well enough...some of the things said didn't seem to make sense at all.
However, the movie was SO charming, I didn't really care. A few times I've watched Asian cinema with a supposed strong female lead that almost caricaturized women in general. Over-the-top drama and or overly emotional displays are the norm. But I really liked both the female and male leads. Also, some are saying that the movie confused itself with a horror. I've seen about a million horror movies and I'd say this movie is a rom-com with a touch of a ghost story, too. Nothing too scary, in my opinion. Really liked it - gonna keep it and watch again!!",1464480000,,900,4.63125

Unfortunately.  20 minutes into the movie and I am can count the number of lines of English subtitles on one hand despite, a large amount of dialogue.  Fortunately years of watching K-dramas, I was able to pick out the words I know and get the gist of what they are saying.  If I weren't trying to learn Korean I would send it back.

I felt that she came off more cheesy than funny or spooky. I also miss the normal Korean character development. This is one of those stories that could have easily been made into a drama series.",1416787200,,353,4.268656716417911

5370958,5,B009XEANH4,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a little of everything:  Romance, scariness (but not bloody/gory) and an interesting backstory for the main female lead.  I wish there would have been a little bit more backstory for the main male lead.  The special effects were done well.  They were minimal but effective enough to enhance the plot along they way.  Overall, I liked the entire way this movie was written, directed and produced.

I really liked both main actors in this movie, Ye-Jin Son and and Min-Ki Lee.  They were excellent for these roles.  I will be looking for more shows with them in it.  If you like having a romance, tied in with a slightly scary storyline then this movie is for you.  I'll be watching it again very soon.  I highly recommend this movie.",1398988800,3,828,4.557823129251701
