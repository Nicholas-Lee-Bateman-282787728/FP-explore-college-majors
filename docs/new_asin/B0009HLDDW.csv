The Parisian setting makes for a nice cultural contrast (although it becomes embarrassingly clear that creator Hiroi Ohji literally has no idea what Christianity and Christians are like; he's not insulting, just clueless); however, this is somewhat undermined by the fact that this new team is made up of characters so obviously cloned from the original team that viewers will have no trouble picking them out: Erika is Sakura,  Glycine is Sumire, Lobelia is Maria, etc.  Second, this set of OVA episodes suffers from the opposite problem that the TV series does: too much is attempted in too short a time.  In three 25 minute episodes the five member team is recruited more by coincidence than anything else in order to get them up and fighting by the end of episode 3, and virtually nothing is known about the characters beyond the most superficial characteristics.  Their almost instant teamwork (beyond the usual stereotypical bickering) is thus inexplicable, particularly in the case of Lobelia who is ""recruited"" by the paramilitary police demolishing an entire section of Paris in order to capture or kill her as the situation requires, accidentally capturing her at the end after they'd given up and switched to trying to kill her.",1456790400,,2665,7.6677524429967425
8060830,4,B0009HLDDW,"Sakura Taisen/Wars is a video game series by Sega that combines Strategy RPG/Mecha elements with that of a Dating Sim. The series has proved to be megapopular and one of Sega's biggest franchises this side of Sonic The Hedgehog....in Japan. You see, despite the series just BEGGING to be released to international markets, very few materials have actually been released to the United States. Ecole De Paris here is one of them. This OVA is a prequel of sorts to Sakura Taisen III, so it serves as an origin story for the characters debuting in that game. However, with that said, I should say that one should NOT just watch this without previous experience with the franchise. I'd recommend watching the Sakura Wars anime series- before jumping into this .

Anyways, like I said before, this is a prequel to Sakura Taisen III and thus focuses on the members of the Paris Assault Force, and how they came to join it. My only problem is that despite being advertised as an 'origin story', only 3 of the 5 members are actually focused on. The remaining 2 are just suddenly there in the 2nd and 3rd episodes of the OVA! Along with that, the CGI used in this looks, dare I say, conspicuous and makes me think sometimes that I'm watching an episode of Cubix.

Despite these flaws, this doesn't make this a bad OVA by any means. The characters are well presented and very likable (ESPECIALLY Erica), the action scenes, along with the animation in general, are well made even with the Cubix-esque CGI at times, and, overall, this is a decently well done OVA that makes a great companion for any Sakura Taisen/Wars fan.

Final Rating:
-Story: 4.00/5
-Characters: 4.25/5
-Animation: 4.25/5
-Overall: 4.50/5",1377043200,,1696,4.742372881355932
8060831,3,B0009HLDDW,"I was not quite as impressed with this sidebar as I was with the original series, which featured young women so strong I bought a copy for my god-daughter's bat mitzvah. I don't get enough backstory for these girls of the French Flower Division to have a favourite, and I longed for Ogami to appear already and give me a familiar touchstone. The ending seemed way too rushed and video gamish. I'd stick with the original Japanese crew.",1367884800,,435,4.589743589743589
8060832,5,B0009HLDDW,"By happy accident I discovered this DVD in a display in a discount/discontinued merchandise store.  It was my introduction to the world of Sakura Taisen/Wars, and I have to admit it was more than a little confusing.  Like other DVDs I have reviewed here, the first ""Sakura Wars"" OVA and ""Galaxy Fraulien Yuna"", it is based on a video game that was only available in Japan.  The overall purpose of it is to ( naturally ) capatilize on the popularity of the game; but also allow further development and exposition of the characters than the game would allow.  The basic premise of the entire mega-series of games, DVDs, CDs, dolls, figures, etc., etc. ad infinitum, is the conflict between the ""spirit warriors"" in each location ( Tokyo, Paris, and New York ) and the ""Forces of Darkness"" who are spirits of the dead fueled by a thirst for revenge due to the injustices they suffered while living.  This set of 3 25-minute episodes relates the founding and development of the Paris Kagekidian, or fighting/dance troupe; each one concentrating on different members.  It bears watching several times to fully understand the goings-on and relationships of the several main characters; but if you do so, you will be rewarded by the many gems along the way.

It's true the characters fall a little too neatly within the usual stereotypes: the clumsy, but well-meaning ditz; the cute-but-sad pre-teen; the haughty aristocrat; the arrogant loner; the shy but earnest new-comer; and the hapless male commander who must somehow figure out how to wield them into a successful team.  In fact, it's almost like the original ""Sakura Wars"" all over again!  ( And the lone male, Oghami, IS the same! )  Saving it, however, is the beautiful animation, both regular and CGA; the excellent sound and music; and the wonderful voice actresses.  ( Of course here I'm only referring to the Japanese originals - the English substitutes in most anime are so universally wretched I've long ago given up on them! )  Included among these are Etsuko Kozakura, best-known as the cabbit Ryo-Ohki in Tenchi, as the human circus-girl Coquelicot; and Kikuko Inoue, veteran of almost EVERYTHING but probably best-known as Oh!/Ah! My Goddess' Belldandy, here essaying the extremely powerful loner Lobellia Carlini.

This has been I think unfairly criticized for its mix of two-dimensional ""regular"" and three-dimensional CG animation, especially in the few scenes where they are used together.  One point of this DVD was to make it look like the GAME, and I think they succeeded handsomely.  The climactic battle between the rival machines is very well-done and beautiful to watch.  It IS however true that the reason for the fight is obscure at best; but having finally seen ""Sakura Wars - The Movie"", it places it in a bit different context by revealing that the American Douglas-Stewart Company is the source for the mechanical ""puppet"".

A final mention must be made of the extras included on this disc: there are 45 minutes ( at least! ) of interviews with the many people responsible for the many aspects of the series.  It is most enjoyable to see and hear the voice actor and actresses who bring it all to life.  Also included are the series producer/director, Ohji Hiroi; and Kohei Tanaka, who as usual for this series provides the score, which is evocative of a jazzed-up Paris of the 1920's.  The interviews end on the promise of at least a second DVD in this Paris series; unfortunately, so far it only seems to have been available in Japan.",1214611200,6,3516,4.877310924369748
8060833,2,B0009HLDDW,Sakura Taisen-Ecole De Paris is a fragments and lacking anime addition to the Sakura Taisen series.  The show starts off by introducing the main character but then proceeds to assume that the viewer is already aware of the back ground or the characters.  I am aware that the show is based on a game in Japan but as a free standing show it lacks any flow to it.  I bought this DVD since I have all of the previous Sakura Taisen anime DVDs but if I were a new viewer I would skip this one.,1173916800,3,487,4.105263157894737
