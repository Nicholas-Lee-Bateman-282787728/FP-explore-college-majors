8395263,5,B003E21K5U,"This is a really marvellous series which, although produced in English, is meant to be based upon a fictitious Dutch detective living in Amsterdam in the 1970's.  It is based on a series of crime fiction books by Nicholas Freeling, a British-born author who lived much of his life in Holland.  The scripts are quite good, but it's really the acting and distinctive sights and sounds of Dutch life which make this series as enjoyably rich as it is.  Barry Foster was a very good actor who manages to convey both a toughness which has literally seen it all on the rough streets of drug-infested Amsterdam and a more sensitive side.  This is a character who values his colleagues and adores his French-born wife, as well as his children (whom we never really see).  I highly recommend the series, but it's far cheaper to buy all the episodes on the Network DVD 11 disc set rather than buying the North American sets.  This set is, however, region 2, so it requires a multi-region player.",1280707200,6,984,4.626436781609195
