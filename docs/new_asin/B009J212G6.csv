5341256,5,B009J212G6,"Now, here is a funny movie, one that will surely take you by surprise and make you laugh - for sure. If you are not afraid of homosexual humor, ""Gayby"" will be a pleasant discovery. It certainly was for me; hell, for that matter, this movie should be funny for anyone, despite their sexual preferences. And I mean funny.

Matt (Matthew Wilkas) works in comic book store. He is gay, and, at one scene in the film, he tells a friend who just broke up with his boyfriend that ""only gay guys read Wonderwoman."" On the other hand, Jenn (Jenn Harris), his roommate, is a horny, straight woman who works as a yoga instructor. Jenn desperately wants to get pregnant and she asks Matt to be the father. However, Jenn doesn't want to do artificial insemination; she wants to get pregnant the old-fashioned way: by having sex. Matt agrees and he tries his best. All this happens at the same time that he is trying to find a boyfriend. These situations provide very funny moments and situations, which are aided by great, smart writing and acting by Wilkas and Harris, as well as the rest of the perfect cast, all glued together well by director Jonathan Lisecki. In fact, Lisecki gets great laughs and lines as a character named Nelson.

""Gayby"" was an awesome find, a little gem that will keep you laughing from beginning to end. It is also a tender and great date movie. Can't praise it enough. It deservedly won the Narrative Feature Special Jury Award at the Boston Independent Film Festival and Best Film at the Dallas Gay and Lesbian film festival, and others. The DVD includes commentary, deleted scenes and musical sequences, and more. (USA, 2012, color, 89 min).

5341258,4,B009J212G6,"Gayby is a good, but not great, gay comedy about a straight woman and a gay man trying to have a baby together. It is sometimes sexy (most of the gay characters are shirtless at some point and the main character Matt is shirtless often), and often funny. The problem is that the gay supporting characters steal the most laughs, so when those characters aren't onscreen (which is often) the movie isn't near as funny. Still, it's worth seeing for fans of gay cinema. And straight women would probably get some enjoyment out of this as well.",1355875200,2,539,4.56701030927835

5341293,4,B009J212G6,"At first glance the movie has ""indie"" written all over it given the quality of the film, the somewhat less-than-ideal lighting and the lack of significant musical scoring. And I point this out not because indie movies are bad, but more to remind you not to judge a book by its cover. It's far too easy to dismiss a movie as bad based on some of these cues alone when there's a lot more good to be found once you've really dug into things.

The core premise of the movie may not seem all that new, but I certainly appreciated how Lisecki gave things a new spin to keep things interesting. And asking a gay man to father a child naturally is an inherently funny idea when you try to imagine it. All the more so when you have Matthew Wilkas trying to perform that role. Add in how they don't get Jenn pregnant right away and this leads to repeated efforts to get her pregnant night after night and it's certainly a good framework to develop a story around.

And the characters do have interesting stories on their own outside the fertility angle. Jenn of course is trying to figure out what she wants in life and being everyone's whipping girl at the yoga studio certainly isn't a life goal. Matt has his own desires to break into the comic book scene and yet remains deathly afraid of bumping into his ex, who also works in the industry. These are nice little complexities that help round out the characters and do make for a nicely meaty story. Plus Wilkas is rather meaty himself and he manages a performance that oddly reminds me of Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under.

Admittedly the movie is more of the smart kind of funny and definitely not the slapstick kind of funny. So you won't exactly be rolling on the floor laughing due to silly antics but you will find yourself amused at the various one-liners and zingers thrown about and of course the peculiarity of some of the situations the characters find themselves in. And this is pretty consistent throughout the movie, thus setting a nice even tone that is on the lighter side of somber.

I think the best moment in this movie is outside of the little nightly sessions between Jenn and Matt but instead involves Jenn's sister, Kelly (Anna Margret Hollyman). There's a scene later in the movie when Kelly confronts Jenn about whether or not she's truly serious about having a baby as a single woman. And I really don't want to spoil it - let me just assure you that it's a brilliant piece of writing that felt nicely genuine and had me and my partner Tobie both agreeing that Kelly as a character certainly deserves some Best Sister awards or something.

Gayby is a refreshing comedy given its smart writing, fleshed-out characters and certainly interesting conflicts and plot twists. It's not the best movie out there, but it's one of the more innovative ones and it certainly deserves a viewing regardless of your stance single parenthood involving gay fathers - or your sexual orientation either.",1390176000,,2957,4.571698113207547

5341302,4,B009J212G6,GAYBY has good cast....good writing...good laughs.  GAYBY is soooo Broooklyn.  Only thing missing would a series of good street shots.,1374019200,,134,5.65
5341303,4,B009J212G6,"Gayby pulls no punches! It is right in your face from the very beginning. In fact, I was so very pleasantly surprised that I did *not* have to sit through the usual boring, get to know the characters beginning, that I actually sat up and paid attention. Basically, the trailer *is* the beginning. They get right to the main course, you know exactly everything that is going on and you laugh your head off. This is how a comedy should be made. No waiting for the humor here!

True, there are some places where you are hit with the seriousness of it all and the impact of what they are doing has on all those involved as well as the possible consequences of not, up front, agreeing to a few hard and fast rules and realizing that having a baby should not be a selfish decision. But overall, this is a very good script, well acted and well directed.

I was not at all ""put off"" by the 1 over-the-top stereotypical part because in real life, there will always be people who think that they need to ""be"" gay instead of just being themselves; playing the stereotypical role is easier than becoming fully in touch with who they are as a person. There will always be people who do not feel they ""fit in,"" there will always be a gay sub-culture  that appeals to them and, there will always be people within those sub-cultures who feel the need to be ""special"" by acting ""over-the-top."" In other words, for many people the word ""gay"" first and foremost means ""in your face"" instead of simply identifying the gender with whom they sleep. Unfortunately, there are stereotypes on either side of the spectrum comprised of people who *want* to be like those that fit what they see instead of just being themselves. ""Gay"" does not identify me. *I* identify me. Problem with just being yourself is that your average, everyday person makes for a very boring movie.

My RANT aside, this is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.",1373846400,,1912,4.501440922190202
5341304,5,B009J212G6,Simple plot that definitely delivers on all fronts.  Characters were well developed and acted.  A story for today's generation. Enjoy,1373328000,,133,5.6
5341305,3,B009J212G6,"I had wanted to see this for a while and finally got round to it and I must admit to being underwhelmed. The plot is that Matt (Mathew Wilkas `The New Twenty') has a long term `best gal pal' in the form of Jenn (Jenn Harris - `Confessions of a Shopaholic') and she wants to have a baby. The problem is she can't find her Prince Charming and all her relationships last a mere, few months. Mean times she decides to ask Matt if he will be the father, the catch is that she wants to do it the old fashioned way and avoid the whole turkey baster routine. To aid in her fertility she does all she can including taking `horny goat weed'.

We get to meet all their friends including his from the comic store where he works and hers from the gym where she teaches yoga. They are all nice enough and there are some good interchanges between the characters. The problem is it just is so not funny. I could raise barely a smile and it does seem to move at a very slow pace indeed. There is nothing wrong with the actors at all; it is just the material they have to work with, or rather the lack of it. There is some bedroom rutting but all pretty inoffensive and no gay `getting it on' either, so if that is what you were looking for, then best to not bother.

There also is very little background music but there is a very good version of Beyonces `Crazy in Love' which is performed by Antony and the Johnsons, which perked things up. There is genuine warmth from the players with each other and real on screen chemistry which was appreciated and it was fairly well directed, but in the end it was just `ok, hence my rating.",1371340800,6,1614,4.186495176848875
5341306,4,B009J212G6,"This movie had great acting, especially the woman in the lead role. Some aspects of it, like the forced intimacy, were silly.

I could go on and on, but OH! This movie is so cute!  Too bad it didn't have a big budget!

BLURB:  Jenn (straight) and Matt (gay) are best friends from college who are now in their thirties. Single by choice, they decide to fulfill a youthful promise to have a child together... the old fashioned way.

REVIEW:  Writer/Director and okay actor Jonathan Kisecki presented a wonderful wonderful story. I LOVED IT!  The script was sweet and funny and heartfelt and I loved it!

Most the acting was so good!

The characters grow! They seem real. The comedy actually works. The actors are good enough to deliver the dry and sometimes hilarious comedy.

Growth! Growth! Growth!

I loved it! Character-driven story--my FAV!

The guys are super sexy and the women wonderful and real and far more than just the straight female best friend.  I loved this movie. Enough that I want it on DVD.

The characters are real.

And it has messages!

Have you ever carried this HUGE thing on your shoulders and you finally admit it to the person and they don't even remember? And then you realize you carried this for nothing?

A great teacher said to me once that holding grudges and being angry and having hate in your heart is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die....

This movie is sweet and funny and I adored and wonder just how AWESOME it could have been with even a million dollar budget.

It was real

See this movie!

(and there are lots of sexy guys!)

Matthew Wilkas is fun and sexy and a very decent actor. HOT chest. Nice and hairy. Mike Doyle is OMG-HOT even with the geeky glasses and has been in quite a few movies and TV shows. Jonathan Lisecki is write and director and I guess he did a short of this movie first (not sure I understand), but the humor is VERY up-to-date and topical! Louis Cancelmi is HOT and a decent actor. Jenn Harris is amazing and I loved her. She is real.

Some of the acting is okay and some of it is really, really good.

The script is incredible. Really really good.

5341311,5,B009J212G6,"One of the best gay-themed indie films I've ever seen, GAYBY is brilliantly well written and directed without a false note by Jonathan Lisecki. It showcases pitch-perfect performances by Jenn Harris as Jenn, a straight but totally gay-friendly woman who feels her biological clock ticking; and Matthew Wilkas as Matt, her best (gay) friend, whom she recruits to father her baby. The salient point here is that they plan to do it ""the old fashioned way,"" which leads to many moments that are both hilariously awkward and heartwarming. Harris and Wilkas are longtime best friends in real life, which probably goes a long way toward explaining why their chemistry in the movie is amazing. Keep an eye out for perfect supporting performances by such excellent stage and film actors as Mike Doyle, Louis Cancelmi, and Adam Driver, all of whom -- along with Wilkas -- also score off the charts when it comes to charisma and sex appeal. You'll laugh, you'll tear up, and you'll wonder why this beautiful movie isn't more well known, since everyone who sees it falls in love with it.",1366416000,2,1075,4.8478260869565215

As a gay man myself, I have a lot of trouble buying the idea of a gay man being able (or willing) to have sex with a woman -- and not just once, but numerous times.  Even in a silly comedy this is incredibly unrealistic as far as I'm concerned, and even somewhat off-putting.  (And no, I am *NOT* a misogynist.  I love women, I just don't sleep with them.  A psychic once told me, ""You are attracted to women's minds and hearts and men's bodies.""  Makes sense to me.)

The performances are all very good though, including that of writer-director Jonathan Lisecki -- which leads me to my other major problem with this DVD.  Although he is very funny in the movie itself, he also participates in the disc's audio commentary -- and therein lies the problem.  I have always appreciated audio commentaries (when they're done well) as they are a wonderful tool in learning more about the filmmaking process, the craft of acting, the history of the major movie studios, and other topics at hand.  However, when someone doing an audio commentary has a speaking voice or a way of speaking that is personally irritating to me, often I cannot sit through the entire commentary without becoming extremely annoyed.  Several times I have foregone listening to a commentary on a film I'm interested in because I cannot stand the sound of the commentator's voice.  (I discussed this once with the great animation historian Jerry Beck, who told me that [obviously] DVD commentators are chosen for their knowledge of the subject at hand, not for what they sound like.)  As you've probably guessed by now, I find Mr. Lisecki's voice *AND* his manner of speech *VERRRY IRRITATING*.  It's not his extreme effeminacy that irritates me so much (no, I am also not a self-hating homophobe), it's what I perceive -- rightly or wrongly -- as his equally extreme affectedness.  He comes across (to me, at least) as very, very pretentious and affected.  His voice also has a quality of monotonousness to it that drives me up a wall.  All in all, I'd have to liken Mr. Lisecki's commentary to the sound of fingernails scraping across a chalkboard -- for 90 friggin' minutes!  YIKES!!!!!",1363132800,,2281,4.7146464646464645

5341324,4,B009J212G6,This is a simple story and fun but at the same time found it a bit slow and amateurish in dialog and acting. A few time I was going to turn it off but then another funny piece would come up. I would not recommend but just say you would have to try for yourself as other's taste and expectations are different to mine.,1360368000,,317,3.96875

5341327,4,B009J212G6,"I'm one of those gay men who doesn't like children, doesn't understand why anyone would want children, and always considered myself fortunate that my long-term partner feels the same.  Therefore, I was prepared to hate this movie.  What a pleasant surprise it was that this Indie was actually light and entertaining, and not so much focused on the desire to reproduce, but rather centered upon the characters' need for something meaningful and lasting beyond themselves.  Personally, I get that need met by our dog, but that's just me.  I particularly liked that the reproducers realized they weren't particularly great parents, and needed each other, as well as each other's spouses, just to get parenting ALMOST right.  By film's end, I was completely convinced that these four people would each contribute something fabulous to the child's upbringing, and that the kid would be remarkably well adjusted because of the influence of all four parents.  As for one reviewer's reference to a similarity to TV's Will and Grace, I concluded that we simply didn't watch the same movie.  As gay Indies go, this one is one of the best.",1359417600,2,1128,5.0

5341335,4,B009J212G6,"I've gotten so used to terrible gay movies (especially American gay movies made in the last 15 years or so) that it's almost shocking when a good one comes along. Gayby is a good one.

Unlike some in the gay audience, I don't hate stereotypes, because there are some wonderful people who fit most of the stereotypes... except one - the hairless gym boy with blinding white teeth and a perfect tan on every square inch of his totally shaved body. There are NO wonderful people who fit that stereotype, which is one reason American gay movies in general have become so stupid that 99% of them are unwatchable. The only gym bodies in this movie have hair all over them, teeth the color of teeth instead of chalk, and tans (if they have tans at all) only where people naturally get tanned from being out in the sun - all of which is delightful.

This movie has a likable and able cast, a very smart and entertaining screenplay, one of the sexiest men on earth in a tiny role (Tommy Heleringer, who plays Adrian, one of Matt's abortive dates; he also plays Scruffy in a web series called The Outs, and he's so delicious I'd eat him up if he ever came to my door) and (thank God!) New York City. The worst movie ever made in New York is better than the best from LA, and Gayby is far from the worst. It may be the best; it's certainly one of the best. Very much worth seeing.",1357084800,3,1369,4.281853281853282
5341336,5,B009J212G6,"this was a funny movie.  probably not a good choice for full on phobes but for those familiar with

5341337,5,B009J212G6,"This movie was unexpectedly good.  It was full of crisp, intelligent biting dialogue that whilst witty at the surface really challenges all our stereotypes of how bitchy and self absorbed gay characters are portrayed and whether they might not be an accurate reflection of real life.  The premise of the movie and its execution were warmly and credibly achieved.  I recommend it for a good laugh and a healthy dose of introspection of what really matters for all of us, whether gay or straight, that is, whether we love and are loved.",1356998400,2,534,4.782608695652174
5341338,5,B009J212G6,"I really liked this movie.  I've seen the actress in this in a lot of little parts through the years.  She was in ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" working in a thrift store towards the end.  It was fun to see her get a starring role.

I actually thought this movie was pretty realistic...almost like I knew the characters.  Very few movies make me feel that way.  I actually really liked the characters and the movie was one of the very rare ""gay movies"" where the characters had depth.

There's a lot in here that's really funny too.  The actor who plays the ""bear"" character is so funny.  I've seen him in bit parts here and there too, through the years, and hope he gets bigger parts in the future.  He is expert at the one-liners and little quips.  So funny...and the kind of person I wish I knew in real life because he would keep me laughing all the time.",1356912000,2,858,4.3
5341339,5,B009J212G6,"Matt (Matthew Wilson) is a young gay man who works in a comic store.  He's fresh out of a six year failed relationship, and having problems finding someone new.  He commiserates with his longtime best friend, yoga instructor Jenn (Jenn Harris), who is also lonely, and suggests that they have a baby together.  Matt is open to the idea, but a bit stunned when Jenn vetoes the ""turkey baster"" method, and insists they conceive the ""old fashioned way.""  Uh, huh.

Their initial attempts make for some rather amusing almost-slapstick laughs.  But neither anticipated it would take months of such attempts, which made it a bit difficult to date others on the side, while ""saving themselves"" for each other. When they compromise and decide to try do-it-yourself artificial insemination, Matt's campy friend Nelson (actually, the film's writer/director, Jonathan Lisecki, in a scene-stealing role), offers his assistance, since he went through the same process with a lesbian friend. At the same time, both Matt and Jenn find too-hot-to-wait lovers, leading to some guilt feelings and possible regrets.

This is a very funny, somewhat over-the-top comedy, with excellent acting and direction.  Appropriate for mixed gay/straight audiences, and definitely a positive outlook on the concept of gay parenting as well as supportive straight allies.  Won several awards at gay and regional film fests,and nominee for a 2013 Independent Spirit Award.  Not rated, but would be a light R for sexual content, although there is no nudity.  DVD extras include a short subject on which the full-length film is based, as well as several deleted scenes (Don't miss checking out the one with Jenn and ""Logan."")

A few of the actors, as well as the ending could've been better, but the chemistry between Harris and Wilkas will keep you watching and literally have you laughing out loud. Besides a few corny lines/scenes, the film is actually quite pleasant, especially for a low budget LGBTQ film.
