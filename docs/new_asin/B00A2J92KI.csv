5376771,5,B00A2J92KI,"What a fun and heartfelt film Hotel Transylvania was when I recently attended a screening whereby producer Michelle Murdocca (Open Season 2, Stuart Little) explained, ""Executive producer and star, Adam Sandler did an amazing job joining this production late in its original inception. It took some 10 years to get this project in theatres,"" who herself was on the project from the beginning.

Russian born director Genndy Tartakovsky (Star Wars: The Clone Wars) says, ""It was a fun an amazing challenge to get this going and it was a real different environment working with a larger studio."" His attention to the details made this film work from page to screen.

The story centers around a place where all monsters can go to be themselves. Naturally walking around, celebrating anniversaries, eating as they do, sleeping the way they do, even swimming in pools and enjoying a night of fun and partying. The place (a really creepy castle) was built by Dracula himself (voiced amazingly well by Adam Sandler (Click, Bedtime Stories)) and because of an early accident due to the fear that monsters have toward humans, a tragic accident leaves him to be a single father. Raising and `protecting' his daughter from the outside world.

Mavis, his daughter, who is sharply voiced by Selena Gomez (The Wizards of Waverly Place, Another Cinderella Story) reaches her 118th birthday and decides she needs to see the world because of the sheltered life her father has created for her. Due to a series of mishaps and bad turn of events a `lie' goes very wrong and she soon realizes what she has been hidden from.

In steps a real human, quite by accident, Jonathan, played by Andy Samberg (SNL, That's My Boy), wanders his way into the hotel. Yet another lie, Dracula tries to cover his true human self and pass Jonathan off as a `real' monster. Another thing that Dracula didn't see coming was the moment that Mavis and Jonathan meet and their eyes connect, you guessed it, the real magic of the heart happens.

The screenplay by Peter Baynham (Borat, Bruno) and Robert Smigel (SNL, You Don't Mess With The Zohan) does something that most live-action screenplays try to achieve but never do,  it mixes some great fast paced visual gags with a real heart and real believable story. This movie is about a father and daughter relationship as well as misconceptions we all carry with us based on really never checking things out for ourselves.

This film has a great line-up of really hysterical characters including; Frankenstein voiced by Kevin James (King of Queens, Hitch); Mrs. Frankenstein Wanda voiced by Molly Shannon (Superstar, Analyze This); The Wolfman Wayne voiced by Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire, Grown-Ups) and his wife Eunice voiced by Fran Drescher (The Nanny, Beautician and the Beast); The Mummy Murray voiced by CeeLo Green (Kung Fu Panda, Kick Ass) and playing the hunchback Quasimodo is the voice of Jon Lovitz (Big, A League of Their Own).

Great for the Halloween theme and in full 3-D, this film was amazingly funny, and full of great classic-style sight gags that you'll probably need to see it more than once to catch them all. ""I took a lot of time to make sure this film worked on all levels. From the script to the performances and even the technology in making it,"" says the director Genndy . And you can really see it on screen!

What makes this animated feature by Columbia Pictures so good, is that it has a very big heart and an extremely relatable story to go with it. The whole family will really enjoy this film!",1349049600,31,3538,4.805921052631579
5376772,5,B00A2J92KI,"Hotel Transylvania was a really good cartoon movie.  The movie is about a young vampire girl Mavis (Selena Gomez) who wants to go out and explore the world.  Her over protective father Dracula (Adam Sandler) does not want his young daughter to go out and mingle with humans.  He beleives that humans do not like vampires and will try to hurt her but he did tell her that when she turned 118, she could go.  The movie centers around Mavis's 118th birthday and her party.  All of her monster friends and relatives come to celebrate and they have an unexpected guest.....a human.  Mavis falls for the human and the rest as they say, is history.  The movie was cute and age appropriate.  I took my 5 year old to see this and did not cringe once.  She laughed her little head off.  I would see it again anytime.  I hope you find your Zing!",1349049600,79,834,4.35064935064935
5376773,5,B00A2J92KI,I loved this movie.  It was very creative and action filled.  Kept my interest the whole time.  I saw the 3-D version.  Great movie for the whole family.  Will be a must for my DVD collection.,1348876800,7,192,4.222222222222222
5376774,5,B00A2J92KI,"This movies was the best one we have seen as a family in a really long time.  We always end up seeing ""Family Movies"" that are not really age appropriate for an 11 year old.

This movie had so many different age groups in it and you could tell that everyone really enjoyed themselves.

This would be a perfect Family Movie Date Night, Romantic Date Night, Group of Friends, Little Kids and Friends, really any kind of groups could have fun with it.  My theory has always been if you don't have fun and everyone else around you is, well the movie was fun but maybe you weren't.

We will definitely be going back to see it again and can't wait for it to come out on DVD",1348790400,4,667,4.1796875
5376775,3,B00A2J92KI,"This animated tale offers fun, but there's no big surprises going on, just a different take on an Adam Sandler flick. All the monsters including:Dracula; The Invisible Man; Frankenstein and his bride venture off on a mission to a hotel for the sole purpose of escaping a world filled with humans. However, a young man stumbles onto the resort with romantic sparks for Mavis, and trouble begins to brew. The story is about trusting a child to make their own discoveries. The themes are nightmare vacations, vampires, and werewolves. It's more entertaining than it is funny, and the characters do grab your attention!",1348790400,4,615,4.980582524271845
5376776,4,B00A2J92KI,"Hotel Transylvania comes to us from the same creative team that brought us other big box-office, computer-animated hits such as Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie, Astro Boy and Space Chimps 2: Zartog Takes a Drink, which I think is a good thing, as Martha Stewart would say!

I saw an advanced screening of this silver screen gem with my amigos, and I have to say that all of us have not been as entertained as the last time we saw the latest release of Girls Gone Really Wild on DVD. But enough about us...on to Hotel Transylvania. It basically tells the story of Count Dracula (not the Bela Lugosi type, but more the Gary Oldman type from the ultra-erotic Bram Stoker's Dracula!) throwing a birthday shindig in order to commemorate the coming-out party of his only daughter, Beavis. She will be coming out as a 118-year-old lady vampire. Of course, this being a borderline-monster type of movie, all the guests are some of the most diabolical and horrifying monsters that you can think of, such as Nosferatu, the Basilisk, Satan himself, Goatman from Maryland, the Abominable Snowman, Nessie, and, in a totally weird casting move, Scooby Doo.

However, along comes Jonathan, voiced by the lovably clumsy, liberal, Obama-supporting comedian Andrake Samberg. Jonathan and Beavis begin to feel sexually attracted to each other, which is where Count Dracula comes in: He tries everything in his undead and evil power to make sure that Jonathan and Beavis don't end up sleeping together! To do this, he enlists the help of Lon Chaney's the Wolfman and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein's Monster. The three of them ambush Jonathan, beat him up, and, finally, tie a block of cement to his feet and throw him into the Danube River.

All in all, I thought that Hotel Transylvania's strength was to be found in its sociopolitical message, which is likely too lofty for kids to understand. The way I interpreted it, Hotel Transylvania is really about the ""high life"" in America and all of the greed, excess and obsession with money that goes along with it. See, some of you inobservant watchers probably failed to note this, but in the song that plays over the closing credits, there is the line ""you can check out any time, but you can never leave."" I think this proves my very intellectual observation very handily.",1348790400,2,2298,4.812658227848101

5376800,4,B00A2J92KI,"Hotel Transylvania (2012) is good entertainment for the whole family, though geared more toward kids. The plot (though very simple) moves along, and doesnt slow down the film. This film is 100% CGI, but is of very high quality, and not a distraction with fake-looking characters  and choppy movements, like other animated films out there. I particularly like the fact that this film has just the right balance between comedy and horror; it doesnt overindulge in any one area, so you won't be overly frightened or laughing hysterically. The animation is very believable, and the characters are interesting. Overall, Hotel Transylvania is a solid first installment in the film series. The special features are very good as well.",1526083200,,726,5.1525423728813555

5377333,4,B00A2J92KI,"Let's get it clear, I don't like Adam Sandler. I really don't, these past few years he's been kinda annoying, he seems to think he's revelant in today's culture but he's not.  However he does a pretty good job here and is pretty funny. He was good in the last one but I think he was excellent here. He should be doing more animated movies like this, unlike some others. I think he could really make a career out of this.  When I watched this movie I didn't hear Adam Sandler, I heard his character and that is impressive
Now let's get to the movie,  it's cute and funny. It's a touching film about a granddad learning to accept his grandson.  The movie is pretty good for the most part but I do have some complaints.  For one thing, the pop culture references, some are funny but some are cringe worthy.  But don't worry their not long, and they forward the plot.  Now spoiler alert.
I hated how the movie ended, I felt like it was resolved to fast.  I was disappointed on how they just had to include a villian and it was maybe about thirty minutes of showtime at least.  I also hate how Dracula got what he wanted in the end, even after going through so much and just to except his grandson.  He's grandson turned into a vampire at the end but did he really learn anything. Or what about Mavis subplot about being diffrent and wanting to fit in with the humans or accepting that's it's okay to be diffrent, or that humans and monsters can get along. She's just like okay at the end,  then their Johnny who was adorable in the first movie but now he's only around to forward the plot and other times he's just scenery, that really bothered me.  I hated and loved Mavis in this one.  I feel like her character really developed in this one but at the same time it downplays her and I wish she and her father could both learn an important lesson.
Spoiler over.
The animation was better than the original I felt, I half liked the first one but I really like this one. I don't love it but I don't hate it.",1481068800,,2001,4.234210526315789

5377515,4,B00A2J92KI,"The only reason I'm giving this film four stars instead of five is that it's too long.  It's essentially two films in one:  Part One is a father's betrayal of his daughter in an effort to protect her from humans as well as any potential mates, particularly one human boy who inadvertently breaches his meticulous perimeter; Part Two is the father's quest to regain his daughter's trust after she discovers his betrayal.

I passed out at the end of Part One.  My wife was laughing and smiling when I regained consciousness during the final credits, so I assume Part Two was as funny, heartwarming, and entertaining as Part One.",1477612800,,626,4.715596330275229

5377529,4,B00A2J92KI,"This review is more about the Amazon rental experience than the movie itself. All in all, the rental experience works very much like going to the old brick and mortar, picking a title, checking out, playing it for x days, then returning it. I was unsure about the whole process at first because I didn't know if the title would get clawed back as soon as we finished watching it or what, so I gave it a try. Truth is, they give you 48 hours usage rights and you can watch it over and over if you like. Perfect for the kiddies to enjoy it over a ~3 day span. Best part is, no having to drive to get it and no returning it on time or getting hit for another rental period (yay!).

Okay, that out of the way, the only NEGATIVE I observed is that there is a little ramp-up time to get to HDTV / 1080p video quality. Depending on the kind of movie you watch, it can be annoying to see the upscaled QCIF resolution with serious compression artifacts progress to SD, then to ED, then finally HD over the course of a minute or two if it's the kind of movie that immediately breaks into action instead of rolling a bunch of boring credits first. However, once you're pulling the video down at the full HDTV resolution, it's admittedly way better than one of (and probably their biggest) competitors, which shall go nameless. Actually, compared to said competitor, Amazon's HD blows them out of the water.

We were using our Vizio E48 Smart TV to watch it, so maybe Amazon can work with Vizio (or vice-versa) to make some tweaks to improve the content delivery experience. I'll try streaming from other HD-enabled devices in the future to see if it's consistent or not.",1477267200,2,1659,4.383116883116883

Was it predictable? Of course. Its an animation geared towards children (what would you expect?) -but like most of the animation movies of today, there were quite a few 'hidden humor' spots as well which would be completely missed by the younger audience (not unexpected since it is the adults, after all, who are forking over the bread and it doesn't hurt to keep THEM entertained as well). The movie is fairly fast-paced and the animation well done. I'm usually a little apprehensive when I've harbored good expectations from a movie based on clips/previews, but in this case I felt it truly delivered. This one will be added to our library when it (eventually) hits the shelves. Too many people look for a great amount of depth and unpredictability in animation movies -but THAT is a bit unrealistic (no pun intended) -think about it: These things USED to be called CARTOON MOVIES for a reason. They weren't intended to fit that kind of expectation. They ARE intended to be fun -and this movie is just that: FUN.",1474243200,8,1189,4.69377990430622

It was actually more for me than them so no parenting lectures please. I rarely give in and ALMOST never condone bad behavior. It's a great story about a father having a hard time letting his little girl grow up. It's witty and I love the all star cast. The songs are sweetly infectious. The only scary parts for the little ones are when Drac ""growls"" but it only happens a couple times.",1464825600,,515,4.16

5378034,5,B00A2J92KI,"My wife and I are both suckers for this type of movie.  I'm very glad to say Hotel Transylvania did not leave us wanting or let us down.  This is both a cute and funny movie.

In a nutshell, Count Dracula's ""Little Daughter Mavis"" has a coming of age 118th birthday party.  All the monsters are at the hotel, safe in the midst of nowhere.  What Mavis wants most is freedom.  But like any dad, dear old Drac doesn't want his little girl to actually grow up and move out. Bleh-bleh, bleh.

Human, Jonathan, a free spirited young man somehow finds himself at the hotel.  This is a definite no-no as humans are NOT allowed.  This is the last bastion of safety for monsters.

What transpires during course of the film is Dracula letting go his baby to her womanhood.  If it were not for the ""monsters,"" and by no means are they scary except maybe the very young or some children who do not really have a grip on reality, this could be any movie at all.  The message, regardless of how it was presented, is the same.  A father's love is uncondltional and only daughter is the apple of his eye.",1464393600,3,1087,4.295566502463054

As far a kids movies go, I would watch Hotel Transylvania all day over a classic Disney movie.  As an adult, I was laughing at the kids jokes and the adult jokes/references.  Adam Sandler co-wrote and stars as Dracula along with a ton of famous actors/actresses doing the voices and they all deliver!  If you have seen any Adam Sandler movies, you will notice that he likes to cast his friends...good thing they are all hilarious!

5378178,5,B00A2J92KI,"My 4 year old loves monsters, and Hotel Transylvania is now his favorite. And that is great, because my wife and I really enjoy watching it too! This movie has managed to create funny characters that will appeal to both kids and adults, such as the over-protecting vampire father, the worn-out werewolf father-of-many and the brainless and energetic couple in love.

The pace of the movie is FAST, with almost not a second to breathe between one scene or joke and the next one, which makes re-watching the movie same as enjoyable as the first time.

Only side note: do not expect the movie to make a lot of sense, and be prepared for many inconsistencies. I had to put my nerd side to sleep while the vampires were walking in the daylight or looking at the sun (without it burning their eyes). It is a kids movie, so just relax and enjoy!",1461369600,6,838,4.470588235294118

Now for you true blue movie critics,  I will remind you that it is an Adam Sandler movie (not meant to be taken seriously, literally, and please for heavens sake, DO NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY)
I adored it for the story line that put the sweetest twist on an old tale. My son loved it for the flatulence jokes that almost make him choke he laughs so hard, and I have never seen a 2yr old walk around saying, ""I am Dracula bla bla bla""
As a mother that has loved Adam Sandler my whole life, to really see how much of a father he really is, I love it. If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler and gang, or old monster movies, I would pick something else.",1456790400,7,754,4.094594594594595

5378342,2,B00A2J92KI,"Released in 2012, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is an animated spoof on such classic horror characters as Dracula, Frankensteins monster, the werewolf, and the mummy.  Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) is the widowed father of Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez), and he seeks to protect her from the outside world by creating Hotel Transylvania, a vacation spot for monsters who have come to fear those nasty pitch-fork-carrying, torch-bearing humans.  But on Mavis one hundred eighteenth birthday, her party is crashed by a mortal named Jonathan (Andy Samberg)and he and Mavis fall in love at first sight.

I usually like animated features, but I found HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA an uphill battle.  The animation is technically acceptable, and some of the designs are original and rather fun, but the movie overall is dull as dish water, unimaginative, and frequently vulgar in an unamusing way.  Sander sounds less like Dracula than I do when Im drunk, and the other voice actors are commonplace at best.  I suppose children of a certain age will love the thing, but there are many better animated movies out there for them.  Get one of them and toss this one in the garbage.

5378504,1,B00A2J92KI,"The horror theme (Dracula and his daughter are the main characters, hosting a function for monsters) isn't something I'd normally gravitate towards, and some find it objectionable for children, but it's easy enough to overlook, and can hardly be taken too seriously.  In many respects the film is actually quite funny, although at times the humour is too crude and crass.

But the real issue here is the moral message that comes sugar-coated with the laughs: follow your feelings.  The film deals with the idea of parents letting go of their children (Dracula's daughter turns 18), but deals with this noble theme in a very unhealthy way.  The main message is that young adults should follow their feelings, and if they get a ""zing"" (as Dracula's daughter does in a forbidden relationship), then it's good and right.  Parents are outdated and don't know what real fun is anyway.  Life is about living for the moment and exploring the world, and following the zings that happen.

This is terrible advice for the real world.  Feelings are rarely reliable, and sometimes have destructive consequences, and that's why young people need advice and guidance from parents, who have the benefit of wisdom and experience.  In the film it is the father who looks like the idiot and ends up apologizing to his daughter, whereas really what our world needs is a generation of youth who are more willing to take the advice of their seniors more seriously and who learn the disciplines of self-control and self-denial.  This film boldly proclaims the values of living for the moment and following your feelings, disregarding authority if necessary, and unfortunately this theme could hardly be stated more openly or clearly.

A cleverly made film, but the main message is one that illustrates all that is wrong with Hollywood and with the modern West. Clearly I'm in the minority with this viewpoint, but given that this is the conclusion that zinged with me, even the film itself would defend my right to this alternative perspective, even if it's not a popular one.  - GODLY GADFLY (January 2016)",1453766400,,2084,4.922857142857143

We are adults, but watch a decent amount of animated movies because we find them to be entertaining and typically a pretty clean humor.

Recommend the movie for 4-5 yr olds and up. It has a lot of fun humor but some of it may need to be explained to younger kids, like why a vampire would want to kill a bunch of ""pretend"" town humans--young kids may not get the ""pretend"" part. Also when the girl jumps off the roof of the castle...an adult will know she will eventually turn into a bat & not be hurt/killed--small kids may not, or on the flip side a small child may want to try it for themselves thinking they can turn into a bat. Kids minds are very simple and adults often forget this.",1451433600,2,701,4.043165467625899

My favorite character is the little girl werewolf who fortunately has a major part in the next movie - the only kid who still has some respect for her dad. Sigh.

My husband and I were invited to a work party where they rented the theater for the employees and their families. We went to be good sports and ended up laughing louder than anyone through the entire movie. We got the jokes the little kids didn't. Adam Sandler is quite talented. The script writers and animators got it right with this one. We bought the DVD and watched it on Halloween with our daughter. She loved it, too. Maybe just a little hard to follow for the very young but they'd enjoy the animation even if they didn't get the script. It leaves you smiling. P.S. Hotel Transylvania 2 is just as good.",1447977600,,788,4.556338028169014

There are the obligatory ""bathroom humor"" jokes (which, as parents, we'd prefer were not included) with a film with the PG rating, but the overall presentation is family-friendly.  Also, a central theme of the film is romance and first kiss which would have caused me concern when our tweener was a couple of years younger, but the drama is less intense than some Nickelodeon offerings aimed at teens.  The voice characterizations, the action & humor bits, and the overall plot were very good.  I look forward to watching HT II soon.",1447200000,,619,4.703703703703703

Looking at the casting, you might see Sandler's name and be turned away, but he does a great job of portraying Dracula as the sympathetic father who's afraid to let go.  The animation is bright and colorful, and the jokes (while not all funny) will get a a laugh from all ages.  This will definitely be on the list of Halloween family classics.",1446681600,,432,4.375
