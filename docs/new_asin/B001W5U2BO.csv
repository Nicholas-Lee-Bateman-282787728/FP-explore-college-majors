3823950,5,B001W5U2BO,"Amat Escalante's 'Los Bastardos' (2008), which I had the pleasure of seeing at the Tate Modern in December 2009, fits into the existential `buddy narrative' of films/plays like `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' and  Samuel Beckett's `Waiting for Godot'. The long opening shot is of a desolate urban landscape on the outskirts of Los Angeles, and shows two wandering figures in the far background. Escalante sets the scene for the film and introduces us to the broader social predicaments of the characters, who are illegal Mexican labourers in the United States.

'Los Bastardos' opens slowly and the two main protagonists, Jesus and Fausto, don't come to the fore till at least halfway into the film. They have been contracted to kill an American woman. The woman's life is portrayed as rather drab. She lives with an uncommunicative and awkward adolescent son, with whom she can barely hold a conversation, and she seeks solace through drug use. When Jesus and Fausto break into the woman's home is where the narrative begins to unfold. `Los Bastardos' is very similar, stylistically, to the German director, Michael Haneke's `Funny Games' (1989) - Jesus demands food from the woman and she is constantly watched over with a shotgun. Whilst Haneke's film is very much a modern, dystopian fairy tale with the nice middle class family being tortured and imprisoned by two sadistic sociopaths from no particular place, Escalante portrays believable characters in Jesus and Fausto. Jesus and Fausto are not `natural' friends - Jesus is in his 30s, while Fausto is an awkward and reticent teenager. They are two people thrown together by their own social and economic deracination - neither of them can speak English; they are illegal aliens; and the very thing that has driven them to cross the US border - namely, money for a better life - is something they can only acquire in any substantial amount through killing another human being, whom they know nothing about.

The incarceration of the woman is gruesome and harrowing to follow.  Though the two Mexicans are not brutal to the woman, she is still their prisoner and when she is told to strip down to her underwear to go swimming with them, she takes on a clown-like character and adds an `absurdist' element to the drama. The woman cannot speak enough Spanish to plead or bargain with her kidnappers, and they take advantage of home comforts such as food, swimming pool and TV whilst holding her captive. Escalante could be mocking passivity and consumerism when showing the kidnappers aimlessly lounging around in their victim's home indifferent to her basic humanity, but on the other hand they could be seen as taking advantage of what little comfort is available to them both in America and their home country.

The narrative of `Los Bastardos' in many ways becomes larger than the sum of its parts. Whilst a writer like Samuel Beckett was seen as hinting at the existential, philosophical alienation and deracination of post-war Europe in `Waiting for Godot', Escalante's film opens up channels of discussion about the very real human and existential void created by irrational preoccupations in the Western world with issues such as illegal immigration and the notion of the `economic migrant'. The United States is so determined to keep Latinos out that it is prepared to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on border security and perimeter walls. The inhuman consequences of these policies result in Latin Americans seeking even more dangerous routes, such as through desert, to get across the border leading to tragic consequences for those who perish at the cruel hands of nature.

There is no proper debate about immigration in America or Europe. The real human issues are ignored and immigration is reduced to a merely economic and technical problem - albeit, a very expensive one in terms of the social and financial expenditure required to contain it. The ingenuity of Escalante's film is that it makes us think about what is happening in front of us. He avoids endowing the film with an explicit social message, but you can't watch and fully appreciate a film like `Los Bastardos' if it doesn't make you question why these things happen to people and why it is wrong.",1267747200,8,4246,4.990112994350283
3823951,1,B001W5U2BO,"Saw this movie on Netflix, but they took it out of they're  library.  This movie was so dry and poorly directed,scripted,and the production value is very poor. The characters had no life to them. The women character is a lonely crack whore that really doesn't put up any kind of struggle while these guys are in her house.  It also put down Mexican minority race... I kinda took it offensive. I would steer clear of this. It looks like a Craigs list piece of crap.",1263254400,2,464,4.435294117647059
3823952,5,B001W5U2BO,"El Norte meets Pulp Fiction (sort of, but that's a simplification). Caught this little gem at the LA Film Festival today. On a shoe-string budget, director Amat Escalante and his co-writer brother Martin create a tension-filled piece that melds genres and offers it's share of shocks. Undocumented immigrant dayworkers take a very wrong turn on the road to  their American dream with harrowing results for all concerned. Brave performance by Nina Zavarin as a disaffected divorced/separated mom whose numbed life may suddenly be derailed by her encounter with the two other protagonists. Escalante has flair for visual composition both indoors and out in the Southern California urbanscapes where this tale unfolds. Recommended.",1245801600,8,728,5.5

3823957,3,B001W5U2BO,"For me, a movie gets a minimum 3 stars if it tries like heck to be totally real.  That is the case here.  The story and script are also creative and relatively unpredictable.  Next time you buy a head of lettuce, you'll wonder how much it really cost.  That's what a movie should do.

3823961,5,B001W5U2BO,"I read the reivews, and about half of them compalin of being boring. It is a very artsy film, so the camera shots are very artistic. Long, 'boring"" shots of Los Angelas. Howver, I thought they were beautful. This isn't a Bruce Willis action thriller, where its more about the special effects in the action then anything else, This was a well written story that makes you think. I enjoyed it, evne though a few parts  Ihad to fast forward through, like the sex scene, because it was too mch for me. The anxiety the director created with his slow moving camera angles was overwhelming. This isn't a typical movie, however one reviewer has seen movies in this similar genre which I haven't. It did remind me of Quintin Terintion prior to Death Proof. I think that movie and all after that he made have been lousy. this may not be your cup of tee, it is a very classic style. Reminds me too of Sergio Leone, and I know a lot of people would call that boring too right? Wide, beautiul shots of Italy and Mexico where there is as much to be said about the surroundings as the story itself. Apperently this is back on Netflix, as I watched it last night and this morning. I feel that this director and writer of this story deserve much more credit, and fame. I have seen many Hollywood movies in the past 5 yeras that weren't 1/8th this good, with not nearly as much skill an, talent and hard work these guys put into this movie. perhaps the story was too much for some of you, and it is a really unexcepted twist. I love this style thouygh and the directors and producers did a phenomenal job. A++++++ definately a great movie.",1362614400,3,1621,4.367549668874172
3823962,1,B001W5U2BO,Horrible movie.  It was like following illegal immigrants around watching them sit day after day to try to get daily construction jobs.  I never got through half the movie.,1362441600,,172,4.896551724137931
8346947,2,B001W5U2BO,"I wanted to like this movie.  In the end, I did not.  Why?

The first half is very slowly paced.  We see two Mexicans walking down a canal in southern California.  They are undocumented and are looking for work.  Jesus is the older man, with a sawed-off shotgun inside his backpack that's slung over his shoulder, and Fausto is the younger, more quiet man who's learning from Jesus. They don't look like men with good intentions. There is minimal dialogue between them.

Neither speak English and gather at a day labor point where they see Americans come and go to fetch laborers willing to work below minimum wage.  They are lucky to fetch one home builder who pays six Mexicans ten dollars an hour for almost ten hours of work and who then only unwillingly drives the group of men back to the street corner they were in the morning.  One sees the abuse and mistreatment Americans show toward these Mexicans.  It's a very slow-paced movie with drawn-out scenes that border on dull.

But then things pick up halfway through this otherwise well-acted movie. The two men enter an open window of a home in a nice neighborhood and come across a woman passed out after smoking some crack.  Her careless teenaged son Trevor has gone out with friends for the night and she is alone. The two men take advantage of her vulnerability that is disturbing and senseless as one doesn't understand the motive.  It's suspense and psychological horror combined.  Then suddently things really go bad and one understands the title of the movie.  No sympathy is lost on the two men at all. Both made bad choices and one of them has to live with the result of their choices.

I'm still trying to understand the motive or message of this film.  In the end it's more disturbing than thought-provoking.",1482537600,,1778,4.647435897435898

8346951,5,B001W5U2BO,"Very good movie. Seems somewhat slow-paced at the beginning but the tempo seems to be deliberate.
