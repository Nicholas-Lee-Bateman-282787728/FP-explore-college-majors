8587965,5,B00CZNSW0U,Very informative.  I'm visiting the Cinque Terre in September and now feel I know some of its history.  Love the old photos!,1394409600,,124,4.590909090909091
8587966,5,B00CZNSW0U,"Fantastic documentary with beautiful images, touching perspective, and insightful concepts. I finished it wanting to try some of their wine and visit this place, but with a reverence to the past and greater appreciation of the culture. It's amazing how fragile traditions and even a way of life have become in this day and this documentary does a fantastic job highlighting the conflicts we all face between the so called desire for progress pitted against preservation of the past.",1383350400,,482,5.113924050632911
8587967,5,B00CZNSW0U,"A fascinating, in-depth look at how life used to be and how it is today in the Cinque Terre, and how tourism and the economy is impacting this stunningly beautiful part of the Italian coastline. How can the locals keep their traditional way of life yet survive in the modern world? This film explores that very question as it talks to the artisans and small business owners, some of whom embrace tourism while others fight against catering to the hoards that arrive, every season, in their sleepy villages from all over the planet. The Cinque Terre is captured in all its beauty with some wonderful vistas and moments as this film takes you into a world you might never see again.",1374883200,,680,4.628099173553719
8587968,5,B00CZNSW0U,"If you love wine and you love movies, then you probably remember Miles in Sideways when he was talking about his love for Pinot Noir. He said that unlike some varietals that can thrive anywhere, Pinot needs constant care and attention; ""And in fact it can only grow in these really specific, little, tucked away corners of the world. And only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it, really. Only somebody who really takes the time to understand Pinot's potential can then coax it into its fullest expression."" Cinque de Terre is that little gem, tucked away in the corner of Italy. And Sciacchetra is the wine that has been painstakingly produced for over 1,000 years.  Certainly, Miles would approve. This documentary does a superb job of capturing the wine making tradition in Cinque de Terre. But like many things in life--including good wines-- it's a little more complex than that: it's not just the grape that struggles, but the people harvesting it, the earth cradling it, the communities embracing it, and the global realities encroaching on it.

Cinque Terre is one of the most beautiful and well preserved places on earth. But it faces a dilemma: How does it preserve its unique traditions and heritage in the face of overwhelming tourism? As such, this is a story about what once was, what is, and what can be. The Directors do a masterful job of capturing this tale. The documentary not provides stunning visuals of Cinque Terre and its vistas, but it also interweaves insightful interviews (with community members, leaders, and tourists) with historical photographs and video footage to tell its story.  By the end of the documentary you will have a firm grasp on what once was and what presently is. However, you'll still be left wondering: Will Cinque Terre be coaxed into its fullest expression?

I highly recommend this documentary for wine lovers and those interesting in better understanding the perspectives of a set of communities dealing with issues (e.g., growing tourism, identity loss, ""selling out"", government involvement) that will be more and more commonplace in our expanding global marketplace.",1374624000,4,2138,5.014084507042254
8587969,5,B00CZNSW0U,"Wonderful documentary with absolutely amazing shots of an area of Italy I knew very little about.  Vendemmia is such an eye-opener into this small village that is struggling with preserving it's culture and traditions.  I have traveled abroad and must say that my future trips will be seen through a different lens after watching this film.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.  It is so beautifully crafted and offers such personal insight into an issue that is surely affecting many tourist areas in our world.  I just love movies that offer you the opportunity to really ""see"" how financial decisions affect our small towns, their families and ultimately, each one of us.  Well Done!!!",1373587200,,693,4.982608695652174
8587970,5,B00CZNSW0U,"A sad tale of old world charm being dragged into the 21st century with well intentioned government assistance gone wrong, the unavoidable  overwhelming of the local culture and, to top it off, a natural disaster.  What else can go wrong?  I can not wait to see the sequal.",1372550400,,272,4.625
8587971,5,B00CZNSW0U,"This documentary is beautifully shot and edited, and reveals what is facing the Cinque Terre region of Italy as economic, social, and political mores shift.  From staggering views of cliffside vineyards to personal interviews with stakeholders in Vernazza, this film explores what most tourists never even consider--that the more they visit, bringing in much-needed revenue to municipalities, the more they inadvertently remove the authenticity of what they are visiting.  ""Vendemmia"" features a family that has made wine by hand as their relatives had for centuries before them, and explores what happens when the present collides with the past.  How can you run a sustainable business without sacrificing what makes it unique, and how can traditions merge with a global economy?

This film forced me to think about my role as a tourist, and how ""leave no trace"" extends far beyond camping.  Watching ""Vendemmia"" will make you reconsider your own tourism goals--I think it's laudable to be a student of the world, but we need to be visitors, not tourists.  There is a difference and this film illustrates aptly how external forces can reshape villages, and not always for the better.  Very professional, engaging, and insightful.  I'm planning to watch it again.",1371600000,5,1263,5.248756218905473
