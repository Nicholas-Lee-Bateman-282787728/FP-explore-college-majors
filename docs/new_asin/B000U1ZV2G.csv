2914367,5,B000U1ZV2G,"October Road may run short of the ""Drama"" of some of today's other shows, but that is why it's so good. No one is being murdered or raped, 14 year olds aren't sleeping with their teachers, and people aren't being blown up. There are very few shows on TV today that are both interesting and appropriate for anyone, especially for teens. When Gilmore Girls went off the air after 7 wonderful seasons, I thought it would be a long time before a wholesome, but exciting and interesting show was on again. October Road is that show. Watch it!",1199836800,35,537,4.489795918367347
2914368,5,B000U1ZV2G,"I recently watched the entire first season on SoapNet. This show automatically drew me in. It took my whole Saturday, from 12-7pm, because once I watched the first episode I couldn't stop watching! Just absolutely loved it! Can't wait for the second season and I'm seriously thinking about buying the first season. October Road is definitely a MUST SEE for people who enjoy these types of series!!!",1197504000,10,398,4.955223880597015

2914370,4,B000U1ZV2G,"""October Road"" was not suppose to be a hit.  It wasn't even suppose to be a series.  After filming the pilot in the winter of 2005, ABC initially passed on the series during their selections for a fall line-up.  But in January of 2007, in a last minute decision (and in desperate need of new material with the up-coming writer's strike) ABC greenlite 5 additional episodes.  And then something crazy happened.  The show premiered and over 14 million people watched its first season.

 ""October Road"" while not a great series by any stretch, is definitely a worthy addition to ABC's lineup.  But unfortunately it has the fatal flaw of thinking that it is much more original and better written than it really is.  The characters are likeable enough, but they are all characters that we have seen many times before, and the series has yet to add anything new or fresh into the mix.  And the same can really be said about the premise of the series.  The main idea is that ""you can never go home again,"" but this is a theme that is continuously used in the latter years of long running series.  But ""October Road"" fails to be as poigagnt as it wants because their isn't enough emotional investment with the characters that is required for the storylines to be particularly impacting or emotional.

 But alas, what ABC has presented here are 6 very well produced, acted, and edited episodes that together make up a first season of a series that shows promise, but needs serious work (and with the season 2 ratings being half of its premier audience, they need to work fast).

 The series itself focuses on a young author, who returns to his hometown for the first time in nearly a decade.  He originally left for a trip to Europe, but for one reason or another he decided to never return, leaving behind several friends, a girlfriend, and his father. In the 10 years, Nick has written a very revealing novel (akin to ""The Catcher and the Rye"") that does not paint his friends in a very flattering light.  Eventually, Nick is asked by the college in his hometown to come back to do a seminar, and upon returning home, he decides to stay and try to get inspired for his next novel.

 The ultimate flaw of the series is that it is just unrealistic for this story to be taken seriously in 2007.  Even in 1997 when Nick left there was email, cell phones, and plane tickets.  Why would he stay away for 10 years, and why would nobody ever tell him that his high school sweetheart happened to have a kid almost exactly 9 months after he left, etc.  But anyway, Buena Vista has included all 6 episodes on 2 discs along with a making-of featurette and deleted scenes.",1196208000,20,2652,4.513626834381552
2914371,5,B000U1ZV2G,"October Road is one of those shows, that when you start watching it, you can't stop. It has a great storyline that keeps you asking for more.

It leaves you wondering what's going to happen next and it always leaves you guessing. The book that the show is based on is great as well. I recommend that if you have seen the show that you read the book. This is defiantly worth getting if you're a true Byran Greenberg fan.

2914463,5,B000U1ZV2G,"October Road is one of those shows that makes you feel like you live in the town with the characters. The actors depict characters well and there is a great plot and sub plots throughout.
The main premise for the show are the events that following Nick Garrett's (Bryan Greenburg) return to his hometown after writing a well received novel based on the people he grew up with, including his jilted ex girlfriend Hannah Daniels (Laura Prepon). The main question on Nick's lips is, who is the father of Sam, Hannah's son?",1355011200,,519,4.6521739130434785

2914495,1,B000U1ZV2G,"""October Road"" opens on a photo of Kurt Cobain , but don't expect to find much rock 'n' roll in this humdrum prodigal-son soap opera. I kept waiting for the unexpected beat, the surprising plot riff, the inverted cliche , but they never came. The drama just plodded predictably down the middle of the road, uninspired, witless, tired.

In some ways, ""October Road"" is like ""Ed,"" only without the oddball rhythms or the sly, sunny presence of Tom Cavanagh . A man goes home again -- to a postcard-quaint town, a few early pals, and a woman with whom he has unfinished business. Nick left girlfriend Hannah in 1997, promising he'd be back from Europe in six weeks. Ten years later, he still hasn't shown his face in town, and, worse, he has written a bestselling novel with unflattering portrayals of his friends.

In short, he's a cowardly narcissist, although at times it's not clear to what extent the show's executive producers, writer Scott Rosenberg and director Gary Fleder , are aware of that. Nick decides to leave New York and move back in with his widower father, to start tying up loose ends. Typically, his motivation is self-centered: He has writer's block. He thinks that resolving his past will enable him to move forward with a new novel. But maybe he'll grow up, too, and maybe he can win back the girl, although Hannah is still furious at him and, of course, dating his nemesis, Ray ""Big Cat"" Cataldo.

Greenberg, one of the actors in HBO's semi-reality series ""Unscripted,"" pays Nick with a tormented sincerity that rivals Dawson in the early years of ""Dawson's Creek."" By the second episode of ""October Road,"" when the cant of emo-lite on the soundtrack is interrupted for Jackson Browne's ""The Pretender,"" the volume of Nick's world-weary earnestness is a little too loud. When he later tries to get a teaching job by singing ""Where Is Love"" from ""Oliver!"" on the lawn outside the dean's bedroom in the middle of the night, his emotional telegraphing is just deafening.

Naturally, Nick left behind a few quirky working-class buddies, one of whom, Eddie, is particularly hurt by the way he was portrayed in Nick's novel. Nick still plays air guitar to Thin Lizzy and Boston with the guys, but he is most focused on Hannah, now the single mother of a 9-year-old -- hint, hint -- boy named Sam.

Nick has his suspicions about Sam, and he pursues them with nary a concern for the well-being of the kid. This being one of those perfectly Hallmark New England towns that only exist on TV, Sam is precocious, of course, and cloyingly so because, as Hannah explains, he prefers ""wise beyond his years"" to ""precocious.""

Prepon emerges from the rampant self-involvement and mediocrity with the most dignity. She blows Greenberg away in their dramatic scenes. She always seemed too grown-up for ""That '70s Show,"" and she fits into a more adult context nicely. If anything in ""October Road"" survives, I hope it's her.",1320019200,2,2927,4.774703557312253

2914499,5,B000U1ZV2G,"This is yet another case of a nice little TV series cancelled too soon.  This one features a writer who used the people in his small town as the basis for a novel and who took off to the big city for 10 years, only to return and face anger and hurt from those he portrayed in print in perhaps less than flattering terms.

October Road reminds me of My So Called Life when it first came out, underrated and not given a chance by many.  But if you give it a chance, you'll see that this show is at the top of the best programming out there.  The acting is first class, even though you won't know most of the cast.  This isn't a bad thing though because never knowing them as another character (minus Hannah), makes them that much more believable as this character.  The storylines are interesting, entertaining, thought-provoking and fun.  The music in each episode is the crown upon it's head!  There's nothing I don't like about this show.
