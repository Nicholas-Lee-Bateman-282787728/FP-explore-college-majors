1706536,5,B0000648Y0,"As one who has been associated with the creators of ""Sweeney"" on other productions and as a champion of the original production, one still has to admit to the plot problems at the end of the original's second act.  This new production effortlessly aviods those traps on the way to the most focused performance of ""Sweeney"" yet.  Featuring two former Sweeneys (George Hearn as Sweeney and Timothy Nolen as a wonderfully re-conceived Judge Turpin), Patti LuPone making the role of Mrs. Lovett totally her own (no easy proposition with the spectre of Angela Lansbury always nearby) and a wonderfuly talented supporting cast, Director Lonny Price guides this production effortlessly to it's grizzly end.  Featuring amazingly thoughtful camerawork which actually advances the plot as opposed to observing it, one gets to know the characters as readily as if this were a fully staged production.  Then again--maybe ""less"" really is ""more"" in this case. The San Francisco Symphony under Rob Fisher is impeccable.  If you value musical theater, if you value Steve Sondheim's supreme contribution to the genre, you must own this version.  But go first class---own them all!

1706537,5,B0000648Y0,"My wife and I attended this taping in San Francisco, and it was magnificent. The treasure here for me was the performance of Lisa Vroman as Johanna. Ms. Vroman performed as Christine in our Phantom of the Opera and sings Johanna better than I have have ever heard it before. Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie) gives a surprisingly good performance, and Patti LuPone is actually tolerable here. No sets, minimal costumes (in fact, if I had any criticisim of this concert, I felt a bit more imagination could have gone into making it a ""staged"" concert) but the cast and the musicians do tremendous justice to this Sondheim masterpiece.",1019520000,11,628,4.824074074074074

1706609,4,B0000648Y0,"I have been a long time fan of this show.  I really enjoy different interpretations of the material.  The biggest reason I purchased this was because I saw it broadcast on PBS and wanted to have this in my library.  Concert versions of shows are very different as the staging moves throughout the orchestra, I find it interseting to watch the actors do their thing without the traditional staging and props.  Excellent performance.  I wish there was more performances available with Victoria Clark - she does not have a lot of stage time but she certainly makes an impact as the begger woman.",1331510400,,592,4.70873786407767
1706610,5,B0000648Y0,"WOW!!!  If I were reduced to a single word to describe this production of Sweeny Todd, that would be it.  Superlatives would rain down endlessly.

Where to start?  Well, let's leave the work itself and the composer, who shall go nameless, out for the moment.  It would be an immense disservice to describe this as a ""concert version"".

First of all, as conceived for television, which is how we are experiencing it after all, ""brilliant"" is the only other single word to apply.  Lonny Price, the director, clearly reveres the piece and with the aid of actor/singers thoroughly imbued in the spirit of Todd, Hearn above all, he manages to make this the most dramatically gripping performance i have ever seen anywhere and I have seen many, live and in person.  Ironically, the limitations of a concert stage, alchemized by spectacular camera work and lighting only heighten, in his extraordinary rendering, every dramatic moment.

I know people who bought tickets to the original NY Philharmonic version of this production mostly in the hopes of hearing Bryn Terfel do Sweeny.  I was not a ticket holder but I was disappointed as well, since I assumed there would be a dvd.  But now that I have watched this I realize that no matter how impressively Terfel might have sung it, nothing can compensate for the degree to which this role is in Hearn's bones.

 To put it mildly, it is fair to say I am no fan of Patti Lupone.  I will go further.  You could not pay me to see her live on stage.  That being said,  she is magnificent and even revelatory in her presentation of Mrs. Lovett.  And every other member of the cast is equally magnificent. As is the marvelously individualized chorus. The San Francisco  Orchestra deserves equal billing, as does Rob Fisher's conducting.  What a marvelous opportunity to hear this truly great score in full cry.  In fact all the way through the tears were rolling down my face, not in sorrow or horror but in joy, and in admiration of the greatness of this score.

That Sondheim makes an appearance at the end, clearly pleased, was an added bonus as was the extra on the making of the production.

You may feel that a concert version of this highly theatrical work could not do it justice.  How wrong you would be!  Forget about the movie.  Please forget the movie!  Buy this.  You will treasure it if you treasure Sondheim, for here he is in all his genius, focused and glittering like a diamond.",1318464000,,2433,4.634660421545667
1706611,5,B0000648Y0,"Comparing other versions of this show recorded on discs, this video  rendition has songs missing from other versions and is by far the best musically. This concert version is a joy to experience. George Hearn is perfect as Sweeny with Patti Lu Pone as Mrs Lovitt.",1231632000,,263,4.717391304347826
1706612,5,B0000648Y0,"I cannot even say how much I love this DVD.  The staging, with the orchestra on the stage mixed with the chorus and soloists, is amazing.  The lighting and the minimal set and props fit in so well with the character of of the musical that you can't imagine it set any other way.

I have a friend who has played in the pit for Sweeney many times.  He saw this DVD and I asked him his opinion.  He said he was in tears watching it.  I replied that I understood, the ending is really emotionally overwhelming.  He said, ""The ending!  I couldn't get through the first half!""  This DVD is that good.

If you've seen the recent movie, you owe it to yourself to see this raw, barren, yet totally sophisticated version.  You owe it to yourself to hear it sung by professional singers and played by a great orchestra!  See it and hear it as Sondheim intended.",1219795200,,850,4.276729559748428
1706613,5,B0000648Y0,"This was an amazing purchase.  It is quite possibly the best version of Sweeney I have ever seen, and I've seen many.  Patti is always a powerhouse vocalist, and her sexy eccentric portrayal of the kooky Mrs. Lovett alone is reason enough to purchase the DVD.  Hearn didn't really do it for me in the Broadway version, but in this version he overflows with pride & love for the show and his title role, which makes his performance a joy to watch.  The supporting cast and musicians are excellent.  The only thing that may raise an eyebrow to those unwilling to suspend their disbelief is the aged faces of the young lovers (and Tobias, sry Neil).  This performance goes about as far as a concert can without being a fully staged musical. Brilliant",1219190400,,747,4.578947368421052
1706614,5,B0000648Y0,"Sweeney Todd in Concert is a stunning performance of Sondheim's greatest work. The only thing better than this DVD would be to have seen it live in San Francisco. George Hearn is brilliant and has eclipsed his stellar performance in the touring show of Sweeney Todd, some 20 or more years ago. As to Davis Gaines as Anthony - no one could sing that role better. Patty Lupone tackles Mrs. Lovitt with unequaled technique. But most importantly, this is the only venue in which to hear Sweeney Todd performed by a symphony orchestra...that alone makes this DVD a superior value and an absolute favorite for anyone's collection. Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd!!!",1215648000,,659,4.84070796460177
1706615,5,B0000648Y0,"This paired-down, yet inventive, staging of ""Sweeney Todd"" actually enhances the excellence of Sondheim's musical score. The intelligent use of lighting suggests horror rather than hitting the audience in the face with it. Without the distractions of fake blood and trap-doors, the viewer is able to focus on the outstanding performances of the cast.  George Hearn may be twenty years older, but his acting, which is phenomenal, makes up for any of the former fulness that might be missing from his voice. Patty Lupone presents a far darker Mrs. Lovett than Angela Lansbury did, but her characterization clears up some of the ambiguities of motivation that were present in her predecessor's trademark interpretation; Lupone's powerful voice blends well with Hearn's.  Neil Patrick Harris was pleasantly surprising in the role of Toby, and the voices of the supporting characters, Anthony, Johanna, Lucy, Judge Turpin, the Beadle, Pirelli, are simply splendid.",1211846400,2,959,5.429530201342282

I have the original Angela Lansbury version as well as the most
recent movie version on DVD and I greatly prefer this one.  Although
you may find the staging much different than you expect (the singers

1706627,5,B0000648Y0,"I have always loved Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd"" especially after designing the lighting for a community theatre production and running it for 15 plus performances hearing the music over and over and never getting tired of it. My other connection to ""Sweeney Todd"" is that the role of Joanna was played in the original production by a young lady from my college's drama department who donated a copy of the first video tape with Angela Lansbury which has now become a great DVD (also in my library). BUT this San Francisco Symphonic version is musically the greatest recordig of them all. The leads are excellent as are alll the supporting roles and noteworthy is the appearance of Neil Patrick Harris in a major supporting role, He is unexpectedly magnificent in the part with more than adequate voice but definitely the acting complementing his performance. The staging is excellent utilizing the liimited space available in and around the full (and it is a full sounding as well as physical) orchestra whose conductor brings out the best in the musicians and the singers. Patti LuPone has never been better--better I think then her earlier concert ""Candide"". George Hearnas the Barber is also outstanding. The lighitng (my strong suite) was possibly the best I've seen for a non-theatre presentation. All in all this is a most marvelous piece of theatre in concert form of all the DVD's in my collection which numbers over 700. Bravo!!!",1202860800,2,1436,4.962655601659751
1706628,5,B0000648Y0,"Sweeney Todd is one of the best musicals ever written, and there is plenty written elsewhere about its artistic merit and plot, so I'll just comment on this particular performance.  It seems like a lot of people hate Patti Lupone, but I really enjoyed her performance.  In particular, her ""A Little Priest"" duet with George Hearn was the funniest thing I've ever seen and you could really feel the chemistry between Lupone and Hearn.  I also liked the flirtatious looks she threw at Sweeney during ""The Worst Pies in London.""  All of these nuances made me believe that she was really in love with Sweeney, which I think is pivotal to making the final scene work.  Compared to Angela Lansbury's Lovett, I had a lot more fun with Patti Lupone.  George Hearn was amazing.  His commanding presence and rich, colorful voice were a joy.  Sweeney can be difficult to play because you can either be too cold and calculating (unsympathetic) or too wildly emotional (unrealistic).  Everyone has their own opinion about where on the spectrum Sweeney should fall, but I felt like Hearn struck the perfect balance in this version (where as he was overacting a bit in the stage production with Angela Lansbury).  As an extra treat, we get the full backing of the San Francisco Symphony and a cast of veteran singers from both Broadway and opera.  Many of the supporting cast are usually lead singers in their own productions!  The semi-staging by Lonny Price worked pretty well though some of the scariness of the stage production was lost.  I really missed the barber chair and the oven especially since the Act II ""Johanna"" is one of my favorite numbers.  Overall, I liked the acting and singing much better in the concert version than the 1982 stage version so this is my favorite Sweeney on DVD.  But I recommend starting with the 1982 video first, if you are new to the show.",1201305600,4,1866,4.716049382716049
1706629,2,B0000648Y0,"I really don't know why I bought this, as it isn't nearly as enjoyable as the TV version with the same Sweeny and Angela Lansbury.  Neil Patrick Harris is surprisingly good, though.",1200528000,2,181,4.65625
1706630,5,B0000648Y0,"Though I haven't seen the film version, this DVD of the concert version produced with the S.F. Symphony Orchestra is extraordinary good.

The characterizations are acute, vibrant, outstanding, while the staging is miraculous.  I'm not for literal interpretations, so for me, it was actually better not to have it staged.

Why?

It allows for the actor-singers, the lighting, and the wonderful music to come to the forefront, as it should.

I have seen clips of the Tim Burton film, and it seems far too literal.  A piece of storytelling, with the music as a soundtrack, the voices of the actors not really singing but speak-singing, which decreases the power of the original piece.

The great choral number with its powerful lyrics has been completely limited.

This concert version is exciting and alive.  The actors come in and out of the darkness, the choreographed movements and staging allow the human imagination to take wing.  You don't need a literal re-creation of Ms. Lovett's bakeshop or the tonsorial parlor, just a receptive imagination!

That said, I wonder how the bass baritone Bryn Terfel would have been (he was originally to play the role of Sweeney in the Chicago Lyric Opera staging).

Here in the concert version it is THUNDERING, a blast of human and instrumental fury, the brilliant lyrics penetrating the viewer/listener's  mind.",1199491200,3,1354,5.072398190045249
1706631,4,B0000648Y0,"In 1846 Thomas Peckett Prest combined several urban legends in the story A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year it was adapted to the stage under the title SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.  It was popular, and, in an era that knew little of copyright law, theatres throughout England soon picked up the play, changing the story around as they saw fit.  In 1973 playwright Christopher Bond recreated the story for the London stage--and in the process caught the attention of Stephen Sondheim, one of great talents of the 20th Century musical stage.

Using Bond's script as a foundation, Sondheim created a hybrid of musical comedy, operetta, grand opera, and grand guingol for the Broadway stage.  SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened at the Uris Theatre in 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury.  Although it captured every critical accolade imaginable, it proved too dark for most theatregoers, played a somewhat disappointing 557 performances, and lost a fair amount of money in the process; nonetheless, its critical power was such that two tours were mounted, each of which did extremely well, and which led to a film record of the Lansbury-Hearn tour.

After several revivals in various venues and of varying success, the play was selected for a ""concert"" staging in New York in 2000--a format in which a full orchestra supports the vocalists, who play on a largely bare stage with minimal staging in an almost ""recital-like"" manner.  Starring George Hearn (who had played Todd opposite Lansbury on tour) and Patti LuPone, it was a great success--and was restaged in 2001 in San Francisco again with Hearn and LuPone in the leads.  The San Francisco concert was filmed--and this DVD is the result.

Stage performances are designed to be seen live, often with the actors at a significant distance from the audience; as such, they often seem to be overplayed when seen on film.  Such is the case here--but even so, and although the concept of ""concert staging"" requires an additional leap, this is a knock-out.  Johnny Depp's performance in the recent Tim Burton film has received considerable acclaim, and he is indeed excellent, but there is no doubt that Hearn is the great interpreter of the role; he is ferocious, frightening, and absolutely believeable.  It is worth noting that Patti LuPone is something of an acquired taste; those who like her like her tremendously and those who do not tend to cringe at the mention of her name.  Being among the former, I have to say that she is an absolute knock-out in the role of the wicked Mrs. Lovett, who bakes Sweeney's victims into pies; her ""The Worst Pies In London"" is a great masterpiece of dark comedy, and she and Hearn make for a memorable pair.

The downside of seeing SWEENEY TODD in a concert version is that the story does not always lend itself to such a pared-down staging: you miss the tilting chair, the bloody visuals, and corpses piling up as the pies go down--so unless you've already seen the stage version or even the film version you may find yourself a little nonplussed by the sparsness involved.  Nonetheless, this really is the production that began to push SWEENEY TODD toward a wider acceptance in both the musical theatre and opera world, and it is very nice to have a record of it.  The DVD comes with a ""making of"" featurette that includes comments from Hearn, LuPone, members of the principal cast, director Lonny Price--and, thankfully, Stephen Sondheim himself.  I recommend it, but primarily for those who are already used to such ""concert stagings.""

1706632,5,B0000648Y0,"I've seen every version of ""Sweeney Todd."" The original Broadway show, the John Doyle revival, the Tim Burton film, and this concert version filmed with the San Francisco Symphony. This is probably the finest music. Backed by a full symphony orchestra, the Sondheim score has never sounded better and the performances are uniformly superb. This makes an excellent counterpoint to the new film. While the movie emphasizes the action at the expense of the music, this reverses that. While Johnny Depp makes an acceptable Sweeney, he can't hold a vocal candle to George Hearn. And it's unfair to even put Helena Bonham-Carter into the same category as Patti Lupone. In this version, with its minimal staging, one's attention stays firmly on the magnificent score. To me, the movie also lacked the correct balance between the humor and the macabre. It was too dark for too long with only, ""By the Sea"" to brighten things up. But here, as in the original, Mrs. Lovett's songs provide comic relief throughout the show. Patti Lupone is so good, she almost eclipses Angela Lansbury's original Mrs. Lovett. She brings out every nuance and bit of humor in ""Worst Pies in London"" and ""Priest,"" as well as a sexiness and sauciness that Lansbury never had. Bonham-Carter is quite humorless through most of the film, in my opinion. But, mainly, buy this to appreciate fully the brilliant musicality of the Sondheim score and to catch every word of the libretto. If the movie got you interested in the music of Stephen Sondheim, consider this your next lesson in music appreciation.",1198886400,3,1567,4.9393939393939394
1706633,5,B0000648Y0,"**Contains spoilers**
As amazing as Angela Lansbury is as Mrs. Lovett, Patti LuPone in this role is beyond words.  The woman is so talented it's ridiculous!  She was born to play Eva Peron and Mrs. Lovett.  LuPone makes you fall head over heels in love with a woman who makes people into pies, lies, and decieves the man she loves.  She and Hearn are a perfect match.  George Hearn is fantastic as usual.  The two of them will have you laughing, crying, and, ultimately, becoming a vegetarian.  Victoria Clark is fantastic as the beggar woman, and Neil Patrick Harris is heartbreaking at Toby along witht the rest of the amazing cast.  Favorite numbers include: The Worst Pies in London, Poor Thing, Pirelli's Miracle Elixar, Epiphany, A Little Priest, God That's Good, By the Sea, Not While I'm Around, Johanna, Lullaby and, of course, The Ballad of Sweeney Todd.

1706634,5,B0000648Y0,"The entire production is great. I bought it because I am familiar with one of the cast members. Tim Nolen, who appears as the Judge in this production, has developed into a superb artist since I recall him from our college days. He had the lead role for six months after Crawford left the show of The Phantom of the Opera. We sang duets as Trenton State music students back in the early sixties, and he was terrific then as a vocalist. I'm so happy for his success. Go Tex!

1706635,5,B0000648Y0,"After videotaping and marveling at ""Sweeney Todd"", the PBS presentation in 1982, I was pleased to learn of the concert version, especially knowing that George Hearn would again sing the lead.

I was totally unprepared for the absolute magnificence of this performance; it is the finest production of any concert I have ever seen. I believe Sondheim is the greatest living theatrical composer, period!

The supporting cast consists of operatic voices far superior to the Broadway version, and even without full scenery and major props, the movement on the ramps around and through the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Chorus adds a great touch to its overall greatness.

This is an incredibly profound piece of art.",1189209600,3,718,5.172413793103448
1706646,5,B0000648Y0,"This production is amazing, the operatic voices, the full symphony, George Hearn, Patti LuPone, Niel Patrick Harris, Timothy Nolen ...

While I do enjoy the 2005 revival cast recording and find its minimalist orchestrations interesting and even inspired at times, it does not do justice to Sondheim's score.  This orchestral performance does.  I know there are many who prefer the earlier recording with Angela Landsbury.  I find the tempos in the Landsbury recording to be slightly too fast for my taste.  But that is all it is, a matter of taste.  I love LuPone's performance in this symphonic recording.  She brings a more overt sexuality to Mrs. Lovett's role than Landsbury.  Again, it's a matter of taste.",1169596800,5,711,5.017094017094017
1706647,5,B0000648Y0,"I don't generally like or buy musicals.  But Stephen Sondheim is, as his fans well know, in a league of his own.  He is, for me, the greatest composer of all time.

This performance is unique in that the props are minimal (a simple stool for the barber chair, etc), but the live orchestra surrounds the stage, so you get to see close ups of the various musicians while they were playing, and I found this *very* satisfying, so I didn't miss the props at all.  Of course my primary concern was the sound quality and the performance quality, and in that regard, this DVD delivers the goods.

First the orchestra:  this was a full orchestra, and they rendered Sondheim's music better than I've heard in any previous recording.  There was even a real pipe organ in the theater, which opens the performance.  Then the ample chorus steps in to begin to recount the tale of Sweeny, and they are amazingly well rehearsed and sound perfect.

Now the main performers:  Hearns, the original Sweeny, has never sounded better, and Patti LuPone delivered what is probably the best performance of her career.  Every other performer was equally great and either met or exceeded the quality of the original recording.  The passion in these people's faces and the perfection of their voices is a testament to their love of Sondheim's music above all others.

Summary:  As a long time lover of Stephen Sondheim, and with Sweeny Todd being arguably his richest composition, I found this performance stunningly beautiful, and deeply satisfying.  I will keep this recording forever, and have already replayed it many many times.",1166659200,4,1606,4.831501831501831
1706648,5,B0000648Y0,"Since buying this a few weeks ago, I've already watched it 3 times.  Now, the concert setup is a little odd for those expecting to see all of the action, but with the way the stage was designed it works very well and imagination fills in the rest.  I was expecting to be a bit disappointed by the concert version but I've been pleasantly surprised by how good it is.

Now that I've seen the 1982 version (Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal, and Sara Woods), I think that the concert version has a lot to recommend it.  We get to see George Hearn re-visit his character and he brings a wonderful passion and crazed believability to Sweeney Todd.  Patti LuPone does an excellent Mrs. Lovett, but with more sass and sultriness (and sexiness) then the lighter absent-minded Mrs. Lovett in the original.

Pirelli (performed by Stanford Olsen) is a lot more memorable in this version then in the 1982 version.  The Pirelli in the original was a good bit harsher and not as suave.  I think they also redid the dialog and score slightly in the dueling barber scene for the 2001 version as it hangs together a lot better.  Olsen plays a very memorable Pirelli and hits his notes perfectly.

I also have a fondness for the 2001 Joanna instead of the 1982 Joanna.  The concert version features a sweeter and more innocent performance.  Combine that with the fabulous performances by the rest of the cast and you have a very valuable version of Sweeney Todd.",1165622400,7,1459,4.612403100775194
1706649,4,B0000648Y0,"This is a really great concert version of Sweeny Todd. I saw the DVD with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury and I think nobody could top those two together, but Patti Lu Pone does Mrs. Lovett in her own way and it DEFINITELY works. I also think George Hearn needs to be congratulated on not loosing his touch in over 20 years.

It is kinda annoying with no fake blood or trap door, but all the acting and singing is there, so what more do you need? I think the Anthony and Joanna in this version are better than the old DVD. Patti Lu Pone's voice suits the role perfectly and I think she's good enough to be paid attention to and not have people thinking how Angela Lansbury was better every second she's on stage.

Finally, the chorus does annoy me a bit, but you get over it. The filming's pretty good and the quality is excellent. I think it's worth getting this DVD, even if you've seen another version, because it's always good to have the comparison and this is a great performance from practically everyone.",1145750400,9,1013,4.382978723404255
1706650,5,B0000648Y0,"To me, a great Sweeney fan, musically this concert version is the definitive version.  I have one major criticism and that is the inability of Patti Lupone to come even close to a Cockney accent.  Being English myself, this was a major irritant.  She  clips many of our counties to come up with the hybrid dialect she seems satisifed with.  I can find no excuse for this given that there are plenty of first class musical actresses who could have produced a more authentic character.  I am surprised at the Director for cutting corners in this way.  It was interesting to note that many of the cast didn't even try an English accent!  Sweeney Todd is essentially English.  Can you imagine the criticisms if a DVD of a concert version of Oklahoma was released done in a Cockney accent?  However, in all other areas this concert version achieves a quality that many stage productions have lacked.  You are forced to 'attend' this tale and pay close attention to the brilliance of the harmonies, the cleverness of the lyrics and the glorious ensemble voices.  George Hearn emits the kind of disturbing evil which lingers longer than most.  His presence is electric.  All other members of this fine cast are superb. If you love Sondheim then buy this DVD without hesitation.  You will play it over and over again.  Just try to ignore the mish-mash of accents!",1142726400,5,1355,4.702127659574468
1706651,5,B0000648Y0,I highly recommend this version of the show.  I saw it live in SF and was delighted to catch it on PBS and now on DVD.  The singing and performances are excellent.  I have the DVD of the original as well and have heard Angela Lansbury is legendary.  While I really loved Angela Lansbury I felt Patti LuPone brought a realness to the role that was funny and entertaining and much more preferrable.  George Hearn is exceptional as well as Neil Patrick Harris.  The orechestra is fantastic and this show is as close to perfect a production as I have seen.,1121299200,10,552,4.415841584158416
1706652,4,B0000648Y0,"As much as I hate to say it, I think Ms. Lupone is the one thing I don't like about this production.  While I recognize that her voice is powerful, I truly think that her acting range is limited.  What I loved about Angela Landsbury's performance is that her ditziness made her loveable.  In my opinion (my aplogies to the Lupone fans reading this) I think Lupone's choice of making the character more worldly comes across as evil instead of charming.  I liked her rendition of ""Priest,"" but overall, I didn't like the quality she brought to Lovett. I had the same problem with her as Fosca in the recent Lincoln Center production of Passion.  I think she is great when she plays someone like Evita, (strong, ballsy characters) but frail, cute, or sweet are not really her strong suit.

It is still a very good production.  Hearn is amazing, as are Harris, and Clark.  The singing is fantastic, the concert setting really suits the show, not to mention it is one of the best musicals ever written.",1117756800,7,997,4.561797752808989

Sondheim es para mi el ""Mahler"" de los musicales y Sweeny Todd encarna a mi entender su obra maestra. Si me inclino a recomendar la version del concierto es porque aun cuando no se trata de lo que conocemos como un ""revival"", la partitura aqui luce mas brillante; el ensamblaje mucho mas armonico y para el oido de pronto todo parece sorprendentemente nuevo. El juego escenico que el director Lonny Price llevo a cabo al incluir a los coros y orquesta como un elemento vivo de la narrativa, dotan al montaje de un gran poderio, de una sombria excelsitud donde el espectador transita de la intimidacin al extasis, de la ensoniacion romantica al terror. Cuan poderosa -insisto- es ahora la partitura! George Hearn ya habia interpretado un ""Mr. Todd"" deslumbrante al lado de la entraniable Angela Lansburry, pero ahora, con mas edad y experiencia consigue superar el alto estandar de su actuacion pasada. Patti LuPone deshace al publico con su voz enviadiable y su talento abrumador, con singular gracejo se adunia de la escena y su interpretacion es memorable. Lisa Vroman cuya tesitura vocal hace de Johanna un verdero ""Angel en desgracia"" hara que usted desee levantarse y aplaudirla de pie desde su casa. Y si bien Davis Gaines no posee una prescencia escenica arrolladora, su voz compensa los inevitables ""close ups"" para una grabacion de este tipo. El actor que interpreta al Juez Turpin; Timothy Nolen es excleso y bueno y hasta el jovencito que salto a la fama como Doggie Howser MD (Neil Patrick Harris)encaja fabulosamente en la puesta! Un meticuloso casting, un gran director musical y escenico aunados a la genialidad de Sondheim dieron como resultado este material extraordinario, digno de encabezar la coleccion mas prestigiosa.",1111104000,3,1820,4.931596091205212

I was especially disappointed in her ersatz cockney accent that seem to have an attention span all its own. LuPone has an exceptional range and can certainly belt out a Broadway tune. But (and there's that insidious ""but"" again) this was not the role for her. Just cuz ya can sing the song, duzn't mean ya can play the part! Treat yourself--see Angela Lansbury's Lovett.

NO ONE CAN REPLACE ANGELA LANSBURY as the grotesquely avaricious Mrs. Lovett...honestly, I was so horrified at Ms. LuPone's portrayal of the character I could barely register the rest of the cast!  Her delivery was breathless, and not in an effective manner...why, she sounded completely winded on several numbers, and her ""take"" on dialogue delivery was so completely off I felt nothing but pity for George Hearn (who was, of course, brilliant, as always).  While generally I enjoy her (I loved her in ""Anything Goes""), I was tremendously disgusted with Patti LuPone's inept delivery in this performance, and HIGHLY RECOMMEND anyone who's not seen this fantastic musical (and easily one of my very favorites) to partake of the Len Cariou/Angela Lansbury 1982 edition.",1104796800,5,776,5.241935483870968
1706666,4,B0000648Y0,"Behind the mask of vengence, savagery, and malice lies a profound and extremely radiant musical.  This DVD brings the story to life with an amazing cast.  It is the equivalent to the Les Mis Dream Cast recording. Sweeney Todd (George Hearn) is a Barber who resides above a Meat Pie Shop on Fleet Street in London. With the help of Mrs. Lovett (Patti Lupone) He plans of wreaking revenge on a local judge who raped his wife and plans on marrying Todd's young daughter. Along with other extremely memorable characters, including Toby, played by Neil Patrick Harris the story plays out like a greek tradgedy without a happy ending in sight.  This concert version DVD gets four stars for no other reason than the fact that it isn't the full show; however for a concert version in has an extremely large ammount of staging and suprisingly its fair share of props.  The extra features include a half hour ""making of"" program and personal credits for each of the actors. Making this performance more incredible is the chorus, and the bone chilling score brought to life by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. A must have for ANY fan of the macabre.",1101254400,4,1143,4.7
1706667,5,B0000648Y0,"Maybe even better. What the original show lacks, this has, and vise versa, but you have to watch the original one first in order to fully appreciate this revived and revised version. For example, the original has all the sets, costumes, and special effects, but the sound isn't really all that great. This DVD focuses mostly on sound and music quality, but you have to use your imagination in some of the action scenes. Certain things are strictly representational. First of all, there's no blood, and no barber chair with a trap door. Mostly when the actors get killed they just walk off the stage, but the camera work is fantastic. In the original show it was kind of sloppy at times. Here, the camera zooms in so close to the actors faces, in some scenes, that you can actually see the spit flying out of their mouths. That's cool! Additionally, there are certain elements that won't make sense unless you watch the original, such as the oven scenes (there isn't one at all in this version, just a curtain, but the actors pretend that it's the oven door, which is kind of lame).

George Hearn, as always, is astounding in the title role, and with age he seems to have grown more comfortable with it. Patty Lupone is sexy as hell as Mrs. Lovett, and Neil Patrick Harris pulls off a surprisingly convincing performance as Tobias Ragg. Timothy Nolen is of course fabulously perverted and disgusting in his role as Judge Turpen. To tell you the truth, I can't think of a single performer in this production that I didn't like, but I'm running out of room.

Another bonus, this performance contains Judge Turpan's solo, which was cut from the original show when it was performed for television. The original version with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury is available now on DVD, as well. Get them both, and then sit back and enjoy the ride.",1095206400,33,1838,4.634969325153374
1706668,5,B0000648Y0,"This recording was my first exposure to the masterpiece that is ""Sweeney Todd,"" and I was absolutely blown away.  First off, you have that score, that glorious Sondheim score.  Almost entirely sung through, ""Sweeney"" is one of the few musicals where I wouldn't remove a single song, and the operatic voices in this concert coupled with the huge orchestra highlight Sondheim's brilliance perfectly.  The group numbers are especially effective, and the six-part harmony in the Act II opener ""God, That's Good"" will make your eyes bug out.
And the actors!!!  They are all amazingly talented, have divine voices, and have an incredible grasp on the complex characters.  Twenty years after replacing Len Cariou on Broadway, George Hearn proves he still has what it takes to make an amazing Sweeney.  If anything, the added years have made his performance even stronger than it was on the '82 video recording, and his voice hasn't weakened one bit.
Another real find is Neil Patrick Harris (who knew the ex-Dougie Houser was a tenor?), who earned Sondheim's seal of approval as ""the definitive Tobias.""  Watching this performance will prove the platitude is not wasted.  Harris is instantly charming from the moment he takes stage, and the Act II ballad ""Not While I'm Around"" will break your heart.  He sings it with such emotion and a crystal-clear tenor voice that your heart will immediately go out to him, and the song is one of the highlights of this uniformly excellent DVD.
However, for me ""Sweeney Todd"" has and will always be about Mrs. Lovett, and Patti LuPone's performance delivers in spades.  Now, don't get me wrong, Angela Lansbury's performance in the original cast is irreplaceable, but LuPone comes in a very close second.  The vocal pyrotechnics she brings to the role outshine almost all of the cast, and she belts out her songs with a feiry gutso that is utterly captivating.  She knocks her two big solos (""The Worst Pies in London"" and ""By the Sea"") out of the park, and along with Hearn is so utterly charming and entertaining you can't help but rooting for the murdering, revenge-seeking duo.  Granted, Mrs. LuPone lacks a bit of the subtlety Lansbury brought to the role, but at the same time Mrs. Lovett is so much larger than life it hardly matters.
To make a long story short, BUY THIS DISC.  Overall, this is my preferred recording of Sondheim's operatic masterpiece, although the '82 version is also essential due the presence of Angela Lansbury.  Musical theatre fans better start saving, because now there are two essential versions of ""Sweeney"" to own.",1084060800,7,2581,4.914746543778802

On the other hand, the San Francisco version includes the infamous monologue of Judge Turpin, which was cut from the film version of the musical.  For me, the final determinant was Neil Patrick Harris' heart-breakingly beautiful rendition of ""Not While I'm Around.""  Purchase ""Sweeney Todd in Concert.""

1706672,5,B0000648Y0,"I only caught the end of ""Sweeney Todd in Concert"" when it appeared on the local PBS station, so I was gratified to see that the production is available for mass consumption.  ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" remains one of my favorite Broadway shows (I really consider it an opera, but Stephen Sondheim says if you insist on having a label call it an operetta with a strong black comedy element, so I will just avoid using any word beginning with ""o"" and avoid the debate).  I saw the story on ""60 Minutes"" about the production and picked up the record album and played it endlessly once it was available.  I saw a road show production starring June Havoc, better known as ""Baby June,"" the older sister of Gypsy Rose Lee; we are talking a professional vaudevillian comedienne who sang everything about an octave lower than it was written.  But after watching the tour-de-force performance of ""Epiphany"" I was down in the lobby at intermission buying tickets for the next night.  When the 1982 road show with George Hearn and Angela Landsbury was shown on television I taped it, and now we have this concert performance.
The main attraction for me is that both the orchestra and chorus are bigger and better.  The difference this makes in our enjoyment of the show is clear as soon as the company launches into the ""Prologue.""  As for the performers I have to admit that I did not know that the title role was originally supposed to have been played by Bryn Terfel, so I was not aware that the majority of principle singers were trained more in opera than musical theater.  After all, the recognizable names are those of a pair of Broadway veterans, George Hearn and Patti Lupone, plus a television dramedy star, Neil Patrick Howser, er, I mean Harris.  Hearn, of course, knows the part of Sweeney Todd well, and Lupone puts her own stamp on Mrs. Lovett, making the pie shop owner's romantic feelings for the barber more believable.  Director Lonny Price calls Harris the definitive Tobias and I would not be inclined to argue the point.
Again, there is more of a sense of realism to the production, and less of the theater of the macabre, and I think this is due to the casting choices rather than to the stripped down performance of the show where there are no sets, but costumes and props.  I think that the subtle differences in Hearn's performance is as much a reaction to the cast he is singing with as much as his take on the role two decades later.  I can go through the cast of singers and point to the marked differences between these voices and those of the original Broadway cast and find a much greater sense of gravity, from Timothy Nolen as Judge Turpin and Davis Gaines as Anthony Hope to Lisa Vroman as Johanna and Stanford Olsen as Pirelli.  This production of ""Sweeney Todd"" unveils new depths to the story.  There seems an invaluable less here and it certainly suggests that having ""opera"" singers do other pieces of a similar type would bear similar fruit.  I know this was done before with ""West Side Story"" and other Rodgers & Hammerstein shows, but it seems that maybe the music of Sondheim or Andrew Lloyd Webber might be better suited to such attempts than the American musical theater of the 1950s.
As with any taped ""stage"" performance, one of the advantages is that the camera can get us close enough to see what the expressions on the faces of the characters.  Yes, it is somewhat disconcerting to see the orchestra behind the characters, but you forget them after a while.  After all, it is singing that you want to hear.  That is why it must be added that the only reason to buy ""Sweeney Todd in Concert"" on VHS instead of DVD is that you do not have a DVD player.  However, since this is the 21st century, that should not be a problem.  The whole point of a concert is the SOUND and that plays to the strength of the DVD (plus you have three options on the sound to pick the one that best suits your system requirements.",1053820800,13,3969,4.524475524475524
1706673,5,B0000648Y0,"Sweeney Todd is a fantastic musical and this DVD truly lives up to the quality of the show itself. Bear with me as this is probably more of a comparison to the 1982 video than many would like. To begin, of the two, the acting and singing in the Concert is superior. Granted Angela Lansbury isn't to be topped, however LuPone's Lovett is a nicely different interpretation offering more sensuality to the role. I had the good fortune of listening to the New York Philharmonic recording first, and LuPone was extremely grating on that recording, but by the time the Concert was performed in San Fransisco, she toned down a little, providing a much better performance. Overall, I enjoy LuPone's performance on the DVD. She is a true comediene--perhaps my favorite moment is right after Sweeney's Epiphany, a great transition into the lighter feel of A Little Priest.  George Hearn is still fantastic after 20 years, there's nothing else to be said. Lisa Vroman is also good as Johanna. A lot of people have complaints, but I seem to have forgotten her lackluster acting, because I tend to be pretty hypercritical. In fact, my main memory from the DVD is the nuance in Vroman's singing during ""Green Finch..."" which i don't hear in the original cast, but now can't imagine an actress not picking up on it--it concerns the lines ""Are you crowing, Are you screaming?"". Also, she is 27 times better than the girl on the 1982 tour with Hearn and Lansbury. Even if you don't like Vroman, I can't see how you would like the other girl better. Davis Gaines is great, even if he looks pretty old to be Anthony. Nolan makes a great Judge Thurpin and is perfectly disconcerting. Also, the costume concept is great, and the use of platforms surrounding the orchestra is a fantastic idea. As many others have observed, this concert experience far surpasses the Les Mis 10th Anniversary concert. And the only ways that the 82 production is preferable are because it has Lansbury and a massive set. Otherwise, even if you could get the 82 production on DVD, I would suggest this DVD as a first buy.  And since the '82 version isn't available, what are you waiting for?  buy it immediately!",1052265600,9,2170,4.690288713910761
1706674,4,B0000648Y0,"Of the concert musicals I've seen, this is certainly one of the finest. The performers are not quite ""in costume"" but rather in (mostly) all-black Japanese formal wear-flavored variations on the original SWEENEY's costumes. Cleverly done, as is the platform stage design around the orchestra (the exquisite San Fransisco Symphony.) It is also much more intimate and better executed than the lackluster LES MISERABLES IN CONCERT.  The sound and picture quality of the DVD are also crystal-clear.

George Hearn reprises the title role, which he took over for the original Len Cariou on Broadway and played on tour. To me, Hearn is the definitive Sweeney. It's been almost 20 years since he played the role opposite the original Mrs. Lovett, Angela Lansbury, on the PBS performance. At 67, his emotional ferocity combined with his rich, booming baritone are still unmatched. Todd could easily be portrayed as a monster from a horror film, and Hearn gives him humanity and depth that at times brings you to tears.

The casting of Patti LuPone as Mrs. Lovett is an inspired choice, and clearly she is having the time of her life.  If LuPone doesn't actually get inside the character--her acting is very 'nudge-nudge-wink-wink' and punchlines are played directly to the audience--her belt remains one of the most exciting voices in the theatre world.  She not only rises to the challenge of this tricky score, but sings the hell out of it.

The supporting cast is wonderful. Davis Gaines (Anthony) and Lisa Vroman (Johanna) have both chemistry and incomparable pipes, while Neil Patrick Harris makes a sweet Tobias. Timothy Nolen (Judge Turpin), John Aler (Beadle), and Stanford Olsen (Pirelli) are all primarily opera singers and show some fine acting chops. Victoria Clark is a STANDOUT as the Beggar Woman. Also kudos to the vocal chorus who seamlessly go in and out of the action on stage.

The 1982 DVD with Hearn and Lansbury is still a must-have, but this concert is highly recommended as a close runner-up.",1046217600,10,2008,5.012012012012012

George Hearn is the best Sweeney ever; I paid [250$] for a seat in the balcony to see this concert at Lincoln Center - worth every penny!  I think George Hearn is much better than Len Cariou, who ain't bad! When Hearn yells: ""At last, my right arm is complete again!"" it never fails to thrill!  I agree that Patti Lupone is no Angela; but still enjoyable.  I saw it with Audra McDonald as the Beggarwoman; unfortunately, she is not on this DVD, more's the pity.

1706677,5,B0000648Y0,"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
His skin was pale and his eye was odd.
These are the first words of one of the finest musicals ever written. It was written by one of my favorite composers, Stephen Sondheim. It starred one of my favorite performers, George Hearn
As Sweeney
As Sweeney Todd
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. There are other great performers. Patti LuPone is brilliant as Mrs. Lovett. Personally, when I first heard her sing ""The Worst Pies In London"", I didn't ""Lovett."" It was more like yelling than singing. The second time, it was all right. However, I have discovered after that experience that I am prone to change my mind about an actor's performance. For example, sometimes when I watch Jekyll and Hyde: The Musical, I think, ""Oh, God, David Hasselhoff stinks at singing and acting."" Sometimes, I think his singing is o.k. and he could be less hammy and so on and so forth. Lisa Vroman, from Hey, Mr. Producer, plays Johanna. Her singing is divine but her acting is not. I hear that she's playing Christine in The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. When she delivers what (in her case) thankfully little dialogue she has in the show, I am surprised that at her first line, she is not greeted with hisses, boos, and a storm of vegetables and watermelons. I never heard of Neil Patrick Harriss until my dad told me about him. He was very good in this show which is amazing because when they tape a musical with a t.v. star in a singing role, in the case of Jekyll and Hyde, sometimes they stink.
I was first introduced to Sweeney Todd when I saw the cast recording at [a local bookstore]. Then, I found out more and more about the show. I found out that the licensers rate it R. I saw a picture of the show in which a victim was already killed and blood was flowing down his cape. Then, I heard about the concert version being shown on t.v. on Halloween (very appropriate). I wanted to know a bit more about Sweeney Todd. With the 1982 live taping starring George Hearn (again) and Angela Lansbury (the original Mrs. Lovett) out of print, all there was was thbe cd and libretto. I decided to just forget about the show altogether especially when Dad said that it wasn't for me. I saw snippets of the concert version at a Virgin Atlantic store in New York (ironically, I was in New York City to see another Sondheim show, Into the Woods.) I was a little confused by the scattering of the orchestra.
Then, I found out that it would be rebroadcasted on t.v. on Wednesday, October 27, 2002. I taped it and watched it and realized that its content lowers it to a PG-13 rating. First of all, if your first experience of musicals in concert was with Les Miserables, the actors do not stand up and walk over to microphones to sing. Instead, it is more of a staged version of the show except with no sets, very few colorful costumes,(the only colorful clothes in the show are Johanna's white dress and Judge Turpin's mauve bathrobe), only key props (they'd have to be crazy not to have Sweeney's razor.) and a bloodred stage. To lower the sight of the throat slitting, the victims (in the Trio in the second act) are wrapped in blood red capes.
My favorite parts are the recurring song, The Ballad of Sweeney Todd, the scenes where the Beggar Woman wants to have sex with Anthony, Sweeney's Epiphany (George Hearn's performance of that song is breathtaking and amazing), the part where Judge Turpin says, ""When I offered myself to her (Johanna), she showed a certain...reluctance (naturally there was laughter from the audience because who wants to marry their parents)"", the scene where Toby pulls off his wig, and Mrs. Lovett's line after Epiphany: ""That's all very well."" It shows that she's something of a bimbo. I also liked how the bake oven is represented by a blood red curtain.
My favorite songs would have to be (in the order that they appear in) The Ballad of Sweeney Todd (and its numerous reprises), No Place Like London, The Barber and His Wife, Poor Thing, Green Finch and Linnet Bird, Johanna (all three versions), Pirelli's Miracle Elixir (because of the incessant reference to a certain excrement made by Sweeney), that song where Pirelli blackmails Todd only to pay his own price (can anyone tell me the name of that song?), Pretty Women (and its reprise), Epiphany, A Little Priest (and its reprise), God, That's Good, By The Sea (and its reprise), Not While I'm Around (and its reprise), and Parlor Songs.
I was a little confused on the last two times when Sweeney slit his last two throats. When Sweeney slits his first, third, and fourth throat, the camera zooms in so much that it blurs. After the last two throat slittings, after the picture came back to normal, the bodies were nowhere to be found. This is my first complaint. My second complaint is Lisa Vroman's acting. My third is how at first, The Worst Pies in London will seem like yelling, and finally, Image Entertainment has again made it an annoying tradition to have no track cameras at the foot of the stage. Hello, Image, anybody home? The orchestra is onstage. Maybe, they just have tradition or maybe the stages are constructed to close to the audience or maybe all the shows they film have orchestra pits too close to the first row.
All in all, in the words of a certain character from Austin Powers in Goldmember, ""This one's a keeper."" You should get it. You will love it from the first chords of the organ to the end. And check out the Making Of featurette on the DVD.",1036627200,,5503,4.548387096774194

1706680,5,B0000648Y0,"Watching this DVD of ""Sweeney Todd In Concert"" is an overwhelming experience.
Of all the Stephen Sondheim musicals, this is my No. 2 favorite; the No. 1 is ""Passion"". While the two musicals tell totally different stories, they both are enriched with the same musical elements of Stephen Sondheim's music, which is passion and authenticity. ""Sweeney Todd"" is a dark and haunted story, it deals with demon and evil side of human being, and at the same time it entertains, needless to say that all of these are delivered so well by the music scores, as well as the lyrics - another part of the Sondheim's talent, for which the remarkableness hasn't been reached by any other musical writers, yet.
This is the only version of ""Sweeney Todd"" so far I've watched or listened. While I don't have any reference to compare with in terms of cast performance, I am glad that I can truly enjoy this cast and appreciate every effort of every cast member that has turned this operatic musical into a musical sensation. George Hearn, besides an excellent vocal job, fleshes out the complicities of the demon barber Sweeney Todd quite vividly by adding traces of human emotions into the character. Patti LuPone, in her unique and bit-of-rough voice, has done a very good job in depicting Mrs. Lovett. Her performance is outstanding and very entertaining. Neil Patrick Harris is simply wonderful. He is an actor whom you'd feel very comfortable to watch. Everything from him seems so natural. Of all the roles, one character gives me the real chill and that is Judge Turpine, played by Timothy Nolen. In his extraordinary low baritone, crooning or shouting, Nolen vests this twisted character with an immense commanding power, something intangible but truly scary. Lisa Vroman sings beautifully as Johanna, the power of her voice could amaze you when she bursts out in full voice. Comparing to the depth of other characters, Anthony is relatively shallow, and it's a pity that its performer David Gaines doesn't help much in strengthening the role, but he does give a great rendition of ""Johanna"".
One last comment I'd like to say is the staging of this show. With a full orchestra on the stage and cast members around and among, it brilliantly turns the musical into a concert without losing much of the theatrics and dynamics. The set is simple, the color is mainly black, the prop is almost non-existent, and yet, what we've sensed is the luster like a black marble and the intensity that feels like one, too.",1032393600,2,2495,4.831775700934579

1706682,5,B0000648Y0,"I first saw Sweeney Todd in LA during the tour in the early 80s with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury, and was overwhelmed by it.  That version of the show was taped and released by Nederlander on both VHS and LD, and I had long hoped that it would be released on DVD. Admittedly the sound and video would not be up to current standards, but it was so well done that it would hardly matter.  I must admit that I cringed to see that Sweeney was being released in an ""in Concert"" version seeing that other Sondheim shows like Sunday in the Park with George and Into the Woods have been transferred to DVD.  Expecting a standard ""in Concert"" version, with everyone sitting on stage and standing up to sing at microphones [e.g. Les Miz in Concert] I got it anyway.  Well, as other reviews have already stated, this isn't a typical concert version at all.  It is pretty much the whole show done on platforms in and around the orchestra and it works amazingly well even without sets, costumes, effects, etc.  If anything, Hearn is better than he was in the early 80s and LuPone, gives a different [less comic for one], but worthy, interpretation of the role than Lansbury [thankfully seeing that an imitation of Angela's landmark interpretation would have been disasterous].  As everyone has been saying, the supporting cast is stellar Judge Turpin is in particular an excellent interpretation.  The only thing which a first time viewer might find difficult is the relationship of the different locations [especially the operation of the barber chair, the bakehouse, etc], shock effects like the blood and the demise of the Beedle are, of course missing [and, sadly the famous ""door slam"" at the end].  This version is well worth having the full orchestral sound in 5.1 is tremendous.  Still hope that the 82 Hearn Lansbury version will be released on DVD someday, but until then, this is well worth having.",1030924800,,1901,4.716012084592145
1706683,5,B0000648Y0,"What's up with those reviewers who have given a ""serve"" to Davis Gaines?. I bought this version of ""Sweeney Todd"" expecting to see and hear a sub-standard performance by Davis Gaines. I believed every action, word and note from Mr Gaines and I'm glad that I'm now able to put a face to the name on a number of my favourite CD booklets.
I believe that every member of the cast deserves the highest praise. This is an exceptional performance of Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece. Just listening to the way the cast, chorus and orchestra handle the difficult score fills me with awe.
On my scale this rates 99/100. One point off for the shaving competion scene that has never worked in any performance I've ever seen, nor in this version.",1027987200,,732,4.638461538461539
1706684,5,B0000648Y0,"After years of searching, I was finally able to get my hands on a VHS copy of the 1979 touring version.  Only to have a DVD come out with superior sound and visual quality...who knew?
And now the comparisons:
1)  George Hearn has still got it.  He was SPECTACULAR!!!  By far the best Sweeney.
2)  Patti LuPone.  True she's no Angela Landsbury, but who is.  I thought she actually brought a bit of quarkiness to the character that was refreshing.  And, after all, it's not the actor's job to recreate a role that's already been done, but to bring something new to the part, isn't it?
3)  Neil Patrick Harris.  Surprisingly pleasant.  Had the voice, but the character wasn't quite what I was expecting.  I do hope he gets to do Assassins on Broadway, though.
4)  Davis Gaines.  Yeah, whatever.  I hate that character anyway.
The rest of the cast was a breath of fresh air.  This has always been a show that could bring together the best of the Opera world and the Theatre world and this production does just that.  The orchestrations were also very nice.  I was pleased with the staging.  Being a ""Concert Version"", it could have been quite dull, but was not.
If you can get the original video, get it, it's worth it.  But this is a great addition to anyone's collection.",1027296000,3,1269,4.482456140350878
1706685,5,B0000648Y0,"Having just seen the Kennedy Center's production of Sweeney and having all the other productions that have been captured on CD, DVD or VHS, You might say that I am a bit of a fanatic on Sweeney.  This production is second only to the Brian Stokes Mitchell  Sweeney at the Kennedy Center. I certainly hope that the Kennedy Center has the foresight to either do a cast CD or DVD of this production so more folk can experience it.
Its billed as a concert but it really captures a full production feeling thru its imaginative staging.  The Orchestrations are lush and keep the feel from smaller stage adaptations.  George Hearn is a superb Sweeney.  In fact he is very clost to Brain Stokes Mitchell as my favorite Sweeney.  His sweeney is troubled, has been wronged yet can be a homebody in By the Sea.  Stokes Mitchell's Sweeney is a twisted soul from the outset, there is no humanity there at all but a total possession.  You can see the man Sweeney would have been in Hearn's performance while Stokes Mitchell's performance suggests that Todd's original obsession with his wife must have had a creepy side to it too.  Patty Lupone has some cracking and dryness to her voice and also has a little trouble keeping her accents straight, but she has her own take on Mrs. Lovett.  Again, Christine Baranski is my favorite but I would put this Patty Lupons performance far above her performance in the NY Phil version or Angela Lansbury's ont he original cast CD.
Where this Sweeney shines is in the supporting parts.  Davis Gaines is superb as Anthony and especially Timothy Nolen excels as Judge Turpin.  Nolen captures the creepy character perfectly and his voice is wonderful.  Neil Patrick Harris is fine as Toby though Mark Price outdid him at the Kennedy Center.
The best part of the San Francisco performance is the staging.  The orchestra is scattered on the stage.  The singers move around and thru them and have a few props given to them by Kabuki-like prop masters.  This staging blurs the line between a full production and a concert performance.  The only things that were not in use in this perfomance prop wise was the tables and chairs and set of Mrs. L's pie shop.  Otherwise every scene was well defined.  In my mind, this was a full production of the piece.
Last, the sound quality is superb for a live performance with room shaking bass and crisp brass.  All in all a superb DVD!",1026691200,2,2394,4.614657210401892
1706686,4,B0000648Y0,"This was the first Sondheim play that I was familiar with, having bought it maybe three or four years ago after a reccomendation from a composer I corresponded with via the internet, and I immediately became hooked on the music and the dark story with its ever-twisting subplots and meaty characters.
I consider myself knowledgable on the play, its music, and its performers--and I'm 14. The play is so much deeper than most theatre pieces written in the past hundred years, as is to be expected with a Sondheim piece.
As soon as I found out this was coming out, I wanted to buy, but decided to wait a while since I had seen this concert version when it was broadcast on Halloween night on my local PBS station.
About twenty or so years ago, ""Sweeney Todd"" was released on video with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn in their respective roles, and I was unable to obtain a copy, and rather saw then copy that my video store had on file. I love George Hearn in this role. I think that his performance has a very deep and brooding feeling of his own, and you can see his slow, constant change into his vengeful self as the story line progresses. He is as good in this version as he was twenty years ago.
Now, Patti LuPone is a different story. I first watched this concert thinking that she would be great in the role of Mrs. Lovett, but I was very, very wrong. I was familiar with her singing in ""Evita"" and I really enjoyed her on that CD, but undeoubtedly, with age, her voice has deteriorated. She seems to draw out words with a sort of ugliness when she should just pronounce the word, and her harmonies are hideous. Plus, sometimes she's just plain off-key. Rewatching this, she grew on me a little, to the point where she was tolerable, but she's not very good in the role.
Antony and Johanna are great in their roles, even if their Original Cast Album counterparts are better by some. Judge Turpin, who, oddly enough, himself played Sweeney Todd at the Philharmonic, is fair as the judge, though he's a little cheesy if you ask me. The Beadle and Pirelli, both opera singers, are also fine, but nothing special. Since their parts are small, their satisfactory performances aren't substancial anyway. The Beggar Woman, too, was only satisfactory.
Overall, I thought that if you liked ""Sweeney Todd"" to begin with, this is a great addition to your collection. The performances are so/so, with George Hearn being the most notable stand-out, but the others carry their weight, with the exception of Ms. LuPone, who faltered with her role, even she does grows on you after a while. Hearing the music played by a symphony and backed with a hunge chorus is enough to buy this for, and the sets and costumes, while barren, do the trick for the concert setting. If you love Sondheim or Sweeney Todd (or Patti LuPone), then buy this, you won't be dissatisfied.",1024704000,10,2856,4.569200779727096
7960573,5,B0000648Y0,"Many a good comment has been written about this exellent production, so I have little to add about this version of Sweeney Todd, so I will comment on the format as presented on the Blu-Ray edition. The original recording was in 4:3, and quite carefully composed. The Blu-Ray disk has this original version, as well as a zoomed-in 16:9 version which they say is ""high definition"", but isn't - it has no additional detail, and in fact on a large screen it looks worse than the 4:3. That one is also not great by today's standards, but probably the best they could do with something obviously recorded in standard definition only.

The sound, however, is very good on both.

Watch the 4:3 original, it's better.",1503360000,,708,4.656

Patti LuPone is excellent as always and Neal Patrick Harris, Davis Gaines and George Hearn round out this exceptional cast.  Done in a semi-staged concert mode with a full symphony orchestra, it is a joy to see and hear.  Highly recommended!",1502409600,,324,4.649122807017544
7960575,5,B0000648Y0,"A wonderful rendition of Sondheim's Sweeney Todd. Some material is cut, but none of the cuts detract from the performance. Probably not the best version for a first time watcher, but for anyone who has already seen any version of Sweeney it should be easy to follow.

This time around George Hearn's Sweeney seems a little more reserved (most noticeable in Epiphany)  compared to his 1982 performance, but that is understandable and doesn't really matter because his performance is still very satisfying. His appearance and voice have definitely aged well.

Patti LuPone's rich voice sounds much better in this concert version compared to Angela Lansbury's Broadway performance. People have complained about the her accent being off, but I don't have a problem with it.

Neil Patrick Harris' is fantastic as Tobias. I think the only drawback to him playing Tobias is that we don't get to hear is normal singing voice outside of the beginning and ending sections of The Ballad.

I liked Timothy Nolen as the Judge, but from what I've seen of him on youtube as Sweeney, I almost would have rather him and Hearn switched places.

I've read complaints about Davis Gaines' Anthony, but I feel that they are unfounded. I find his voice to be suitable for the character. I feel he expresses the naive optimism of the character quite well.

Lisa Vroman did a great job as Johanna.
John Aler made a great Beadle, and it's always nice to hear him sing.
Stanford Olsen did a good job as Pirelli.

The orchestration is wonderful and definitely adds a ton of epicness to this and more than makes up for the lack of props and effects.

It was also great to see Sondheim come out and bow at the end.",1429315200,2,1684,4.700680272108843
