7854590,3,6303917399,Received it just a few days after ordering which was great. The only problem was the movie jumps a few times while playing but other than that everything was ok.,1364256000,,161,4.4
7854591,3,6303917399,It was ok the acting was terrible but getting to see Linda Carter was Awesome.,1279238400,,78,4.266666666666667
7854592,4,6303917399,"Lynda Carter is the reason to see this movie, if you are a fan you will enjoy it. It's not a classic by any means but I do think that the views of Lynda Carter's anatomy are much better than the previous reviewer states. It's a country flavored shoot-em-up and if you don't have anything better to do on an afternoon I recommend it.",1255305600,5,332,4.203125
7854593,3,6303917399,"Well, I pretty much got this for the nude scenes of a lovely and voluptuous early 1970s Linda Carter, and she certainly is a wonder of a woman! As to the rest of it, a pretty standard movie with little else of consequence going on.",1205193600,4,231,4.155555555555556
7854594,2,6303917399,Some of the original scenes have been cut from this copy.,1125446400,21,57,4.2727272727272725
7854595,4,6303917399,"I really don't think you other reviewers have gotten the point here. This movie is not based on a glance at Lynda Carters  Wonderbreasts sans Wonderbra...it's gosh dern* (that's *darn with a country accent) country fun!

We open as former Evangelist Marjoe Gortner, whom we will call Lyle from now on, steals a Mustang from a braggart salesman.  Naturally he steals the suckers case of sales goods too, and he uses them to pretend HE is a salesman.

After hightailing it to the local drive-in, he spies Lynda Carter whom we will now refer to as BobbyJo, who is attractively waitressing on roller, and skates by a car parked nearby. When her annoying 4 legged gal-pal Essie skates over to take the order instead, she is asked to fetch up BobbyJo right quick, and head herself back to jerking sodas.

 After a few meetings, casual dates, a boring serenade near some rocks by BobbyJo to Lyle, they get busy under the stars, and it's a sexy scene as far as I'm concerned. Not because we see BobbyJo's impressive endowments, but because it's sensually played.  Despite that fact it is the same few seconds seemingly spliced together repeatedly. Why?

 Soon, Lyle convinces BobbyJo to take off with him, and she's game to get away from her flask-swigging nag of a mom who slaps her instead of the usual goodbye kiss as she departs. Unfortunately, BobbyJo won't leave without making it a ""cozy little threesome"" as Lyle calls it sarcastically when Essie, the aforementioned three legged gal-pal tags along. Too bad, she's really not needed for the plot. However, on the bright side, she's the first casualty when the Bonnie and Clyde action begins.

After a few days, and a meeting with a fat old Indian hippie who shares a few magic 'shrooms with the toothsome trio while sitting in a drainage ditch together...(a cutting room floor scene that stayed in the film).

Then  they meet Pearl, BobbyJo's sister, cheap stripper floozy. She's played by Merrie Lynn Ross, who also plays Perry Kings wife in ""Class of 1984"", another Mark Lester classic. Pearl has a man with no brain played by Jesse Vint, another Lester fave. As I recall he's named Jesse IN the movie too. Anyway, after they all hook up, the fun and shoot-outs begin as they pull bank robberies all over New Mexico until everyone is blown away by Deputy Dawg and his gang of Hillbilly Honcho PO-lice. Everyone except BobbyJo, she gets handcuffed and led away by Mr. Dawg, but not before she sheds some tears on the blanket covering the bodies in front of her, and spitting in the law mans face.

 I have read that Lynda Carter was ashamed to have made this movie, but I think it has it's good points. I love the country music score that really fits the beautiful New Mexico scenery. The stars have a sexy chemistry together as well. We all know Lynda Carter is gorgeous, and Marjoe, while not the conventionally handsome type, is very appealing none the less. Merrie Lynn Ross as ""Pearl"" is a perfect bimbo and Jesse Vint, is her perfect compliment, the Himbo. He even wears a black cowboy outfit replete with black hat, just like the villain ought to!  Speaking of complimentary, we have Blonde Lyle, Brunette BobbyJo, then Brunette Jesse, Blonde Pearl! I'm convinced, I'm a brunette married to a blonde myself!

 All that said, this movie has a nice mood, flavor and feel that is not captured too often. Closest film I can think of with this mood is ""Thelma and Louise.""  In that movie, there's no man/woman stuff happening that's positive.  At least here, the men actually care about their women! This is an enjoyable adventure in a style that will never be revisited again, so DO give it a chance if you like this genre.",1003449600,24,3677,4.672868217054264
