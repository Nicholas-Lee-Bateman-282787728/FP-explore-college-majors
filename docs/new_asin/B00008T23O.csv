7986757,5,B00008T23O,"Rarg is an animated short about ""a land so perfect that the sun never rose until it was sure everyone was awake."" The people of Rarg live in blissful contentment, until a frightening discovery is made - they are merely the products of a dream being dreamt by a man named Edwin Barnes. If something isn't done, he might wake up and the world of Rarg will vanish forever!

Rarg first aired on television in the US in 1988, as part of PBS's ""Long Ago and Far Away"" series. It's a delightful animated film that I remember first seeing as a child and it's stuck in my brain ever since. Other people seem to have been similarly impressed by the film. It's one of those stories that just really sticks with you and has a delightful little twist at the end. You don't come across children's stories like this that often. Nigel Hawthorne provides the excellent narration.

If you can, by some miracle, get ahold of this little treasure, consider yourself lucky. The film is almost impossible to find. Last I checked there were a couple copies available on Amazon UK. But good luck finding it. Really deserves better exposure than it has.",1213401600,8,1223,4.60091743119266
