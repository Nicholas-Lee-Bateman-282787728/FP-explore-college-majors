8422710,4,B004C3D2II,"If you're considering boudoir photography, this DVD is a good start. Schmelzer walks you through numerous scenarios, discussing posing and light placement...very important. Perhaps the most helpful were the drawings showing actual light placement, (what I was interested in, being new to this type photography). The locations chosen for shooting were okay, but not terribly creative. The models did a good job posing, both from instruction and of their own accord. This DVD focuses mostly on daylight shooting with Westcott Spiderlites which have fluorescent bulbs. I would have liked to see more, or an additional focus, on shooting with strobe flashes. Only one location used this type lighting. Overall, a good learning experience for novice boudoir photographers.",1367193600,,767,5.564102564102564
