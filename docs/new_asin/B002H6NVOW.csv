8370205,3,B002H6NVOW,"I bought this movie because my 4-year-old daughter loves the Little Miss books. She does like the movie but... some of it is a bit too much for her, not scary exactly but a bit confusing. Also I thought it would be about Miss Sunshine, who is such a positive character, but I don't actually see her in any of these movies. We haven't checked out the bonus features yet - I think she is there but I would have liked to see her in the main features.",1373500800,,447,4.090909090909091

8370208,5,B002H6NVOW,"We purchased this video for our grandchildren ages 4 and 7  and they love it, we bought this because their dad (our son) had the books when he was young and they were a hit back then about 30 yrs ago, we still have a few of the books that the grandchildren read and now the video brings the characters to life. Our grandson the 4 yr old, knows every character by heart. They both have a fun time watching.
