The roy rogers show is poor in quality looks like a second generation tape transfer. The cisco kid has lost some red color (slight bleeding),but not too bad. The big problem with this DVD is that in each episode there seems to be a glitch in the transfering (worse in the roy rogers episode) as it seems to freeze frame in spots for just a few seconds on it's own, an then continues in the play mode. none of this is all that bad and will not ruin your day.",1113436800,,695,4.492063492063492
