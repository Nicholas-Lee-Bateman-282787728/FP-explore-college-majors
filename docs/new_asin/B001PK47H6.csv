3748132,4,B001PK47H6,"As a child, I can easily remember my prized possession was a Walt Disney book that my father purchased for me and it featured the chronology of the early classic Walt Disney animated shorts.  Some of these shorts were shown on the Disney Channel when I was younger but suffice to say, with all the new animation, a lot of these classics have probably been forgotten or have been released on VHS video.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment are now releasing a few of these shorts on DVD for the first time (some have appeared on past Disney DVD releases).  The first three volumes were released on DVD on April 7, 2009.

A lot of these short films were created between the 1920-1940's and typically featured characters that were not reoccurring.  Some were released under the ""Silly Symphony"" moniker of animated shorts released between 1929-1939 which rarely featured any character dialogue but focused more on the animation accompanied by music and a singing vocal track.  Disney has continued to produce shorts today and while the majority of the short animated films are from the 1930's through the 1950's, volume 3 features an animated short (""The Prince & the Pauper) from 1990.

Of the six volumes that have been released from the ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"", for people looking specifically for Mickey Mouse classic animated shorts, you will be able to find them through volume 1 and 3.

Walt Disney Animation Collection Vol. 3: The Prince & the Pauper

The ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" third volume ""The Prince and the Pauper"" features a total of six animated shorts.  Included are:

  1. The Prince and the Pauper - (25:32) This Disney animated short from 1990 about a pauper and a crown prince who look exactly alike.  The two decide to switch identities and experience each other's life.  The pauper as a prince learning about his reponsibilities and the prince as a pauper learning how his Royal Captain of the Guard has been taking advantage of his power.  Directed by George Scribner and screenplay by Gerrit and Sam Graham.
  2. The Pied Piper - (7:37) A Silly Symphony animated short from 1933.  The people of Hamelin has their town being overrun by rats.  They will offer gold to anyone who can get rid of the rats and a piper takes on the job.  Directed by Wilfred Jackson and based on a poem by Robert Browning.
  3. Old King Cole - (7:33) A 1933 Silly Symphony animated short featuring a party thrown by Old King Cole and invited are all the Mother Goose characters.  Directed by David Hand.
  4. Ye Olden Days - (8:25) A 1933 black and white Disney animated short about Princess Minnie who is arranged to marry Prince Goofy.  Minnie refuses to marry him, so her father, the king locks her in the tower.  Minstrel Mickey then tries to rescue her.  Directed by Burt Gillet.
  5. A Knight for the Day - (7:06) A 1946 Disney animated short featuring Goofy as Cedric who has the opportunity to become a knight for a day.  Featuring a story directed by Jack Hannah and written by Bill Peet.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" is featured with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  These classics are available on DVD for the first time but its important to mention that these animated shorts have not been digitally remastered or cleaned up.

As a matter of fact, you will see a lot of the dust and scratches of the film and some of the animation look fine for being nearly 70 years old but others look grainy and a bit aged.  Granted, these are not classic full featured films but I hope one of these days, many of these classics do get cleaned up or even digitally remastered.

""The Prince and the Pauper"" fares the best of the three volumes as this animated short was created in 1990.

As for the audio, audio is featured in Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  I found that on my home theater system, the best selection on my receiver to view these animated shorts was to switch it to mono or (if you have this capability) select stereo for all channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features included on this DVD.  But each volume does come with a free collectible litho print typically of the characters from the main featured story.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As mentioned earlier in my review, my prized possession as a child was a Walt Disney booklet that covered the Walt Disney animated shorts in chronological order and had the opportunity to watch these classics.  Now as an adult with children, a lot of the animation from Walt Disney that my child sees is the latest in CG animation.

But I wanted him to sit and watch these animated shorts with me and sure enough, he enjoyed them.  These animated shorts, the majority of them are simple and have no dialogue.  Just music and sound effects (there were a few especially all from vol. 6 that have dialogue) but nevertheless, are simple and easy to understand.

For fans of classic Walt Disney animation and you pretty much have moved on away from your VHS copies, the ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" is a great collection of your classic Disney animated shorts on DVD.

Many people who have purchased the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" DVD box sets from 2001, ""Walt Disney's Timeless Tales"" from 2005 or the ""Walt Disney's It's a Small World of Fun!"" DVD release from 2007 probably may not need any of these shorts as quite a number of them have appeared on DVD already.

But a few of the short films that are featured on the six volumes of ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" have not been released on DVD until now.

Overall, It all comes down to your preference to the classic animated shorts from long ago and whether or not you owned previous releases.  For those who haven't owned the previous Disney DVD shorts or box sets, now is a good time to start because a lot of the past releases have been discontinued.

Otherwise, if you are a person who already owns the previous DVD releases that contain these shorts, unfortunately, these animated shorts offer nothing new and are not digitally remastered.  There may be a few titles on these DVD's that have not been released before on prior Walt Disney DVD's but it all comes down to your preference and if these episodes are worth having on DVD.

Again, it's important to note that volume 1 and volume 3 feature animated shorts featuring Mickey Mouse or a well-known Disney animated character.  So, if you are specifically looking for Mickey Mouse animated shorts, you will find it on those two volumes.

But if you are a parent or grandparent who wants to show your children or grandchildren the Walt Disney animation that you grew up with or a person who has never seen these shorts and have been curious about them, then definitely give ""Walt Disney Animation Collection"" a chance.",1242691200,36,6732,4.675170068027211

3748145,5,B001PK47H6,"In honor of its 25th anniversary in 2015, here's a review of the Prince and the Pauper, the 3rd volume of Disney's 2009 Animation Collection. Many folks were upset about the main short being in Fullscreen and not the Widescreen print from one of Mickey's color Treasures tins, just like Mickey's Christmas Carol, in volume 7. They were even more upset about the latter being in Faux-Widescreen for its 30th anniversary DVD/Blu-ray release in 2013. Too bad Disney never thought to give The Prince and the Pauper a 25th anniversary DVD/Blu-ray release, Fullscreen OR Widescreen, nor a 20th/15th anniversaries 2-Movie Collection of A Goofy Movie and An Extremely Goofy Movie. At any rate, The Prince and the Pauper was originally seen with The Rescuers Down Under (Disney's 29th animated feature), both of which debuted the very same day as Home Alone 1 from Fox (""And I ain't kiddin', brudder"")! Since Pluto never appeared in Mickey's Christmas Carol, The Prince and the Pauper was his first time on the big screen since The Simple Things in 1953! What's more, toon legend Jim Cummings DIDN'T play Pete here; he didn't start doing so until Goof Troop in 1992, and has BEEN Pete's main actor ever since. Also on this disc are 4 Medieval-themed classic shorts; 3 Silly Symphonies (with The Pied Piper's music unenhanced, compared to volume 1 of Disney's Timeless Tales collection from 2005) and 1 of Goofy (A Knight for A Day). Happy silver (25th) anniversary to The Prince and the Pauper, and also for The Rescuers Down Under AND Home Alone 1!",1449014400,3,1540,4.859315589353612

3748174,5,B001PK47H6,"Mickey Mouse is the icon of Disney, the star of the first talking animated short movie, and once the staple of many other cartoons in the early days of the studio. It's good to see him, Donald and Goofy in adventures of their own in this featurette. It's short, sweet and funny. I bought it as a gift to my grandkids, especially the youngest, who is huge fan of ""Mitty Mouse"" (he can't pronounce the ""K"" sound in Mickey's name yet).
