3161835,5,B0016NOUY2,"[I'm C's wife, K, actually - C's not the one doing the video! *wink*]

I LOVE this program!  Ann leads you through a series of breathing and poses that leave you energized, instead of beaten.  Beautiful music and scenery - it's calming and uplifting at the same time!  And she's gentle and encouraging.  I felt so much better after doing this DVD just once; and after a few days, I could feel that my body was much more balanced, and it showed in my general health (and diet), as well.

If you're a woman looking for health and balance in a busy life, this is the best exercise I've found, and it only takes half an hour!",1208304000,13,621,4.264957264957265
3161836,5,B0016NOUY2,"I've been using this yoga DVD for several weeks now. It is perfect for  working women who also have family obligations, or anyone who leads a busy life. 25 minutes is just right, leaving me feeling both energized and relaxed. It's a great stress management tool, which also builds overall body strength, toning, and flexibility. Ann Richmond provides clear and gentle instruction throughout. I can highly recommend this DVD. If you're looking for power yoga, or a yoga program geared to burn lots of calories, this may not be for you.",1242259200,3,534,4.868131868131868

I have only used it four or five times but loved it from the start. I can see why it's recommended for mom's...I felt my stress melt away. This is my first attempt at yoga and, thanks to her technique, I'm certain I will have it in my life forever. Can't believe I've survived without it.

You do not work up a sweat with this DVD; I doubt that it burns many calories.  You do a lot of stretching, which feels great.  The setting, background music, and voiceovers are well done.

This is perfect. I just had a chance to do it; of course my plan of getting up before the kids and doing it in the morning didn't work out exactly... my 2 1/2 year old joined me.  The content is just what I was looking for and the 30 minute time is just right.
I have another DVD I bought and I find I never get through the whole thing before some one wants something or there's a conflict I have to resolve... 30 minutes is reasonable.
I love how she tells you just what each pose is good for, who knew triangle pose was good for fertility problems!  You could easily pause it and do a few more of those if you wanted/needed.  If you could find the time.
This was made my a stay-at-home mom yoga instructor.  She obviously understands the difficulties of getting to a class (Finding a class that works for you and your kids schedule and the schedule of who ever is watching them for you, then physically dropping them off and getting to class)  It's no easy task and I have difficulty completely the first step.  If I find the perfect class for me it's never at the right time.
I've been doing yoga off and on for years, so I'm not exactly a beginning  but I believe this would be a good routine for a beginner, as well as an on again/ off again yogi like me!

3161843,5,B0016NOUY2,"As a woman who owns nearly as many exercise DVDs as the local library, I consider myself a connoisseur of fitness videos.  Aside from having all of the body image and health worries that most women face (arms, stomach, thighs, buttocks, weight...), I have suffered from anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia for years.  My doctor suggested that I try yoga as a way to center myself and become more in tune with my body, saying that it would also help with relieving anxiety.  I purchased all of the yoga videos I could find, seeking solace in any of them.

Although all of the DVDs I bought said ""beginner"" on the case, let me stress that NONE of these other videos were for beginners!  The instructors kept encouraging me to stretch just a little bit further, really reach into it, all while maintaining control over my breath and feeling the stress and pounds melt away.  It's true, my stress and anxiety did melt away--after I turned the DVD off and turned on an episode of ""Lost.""

It wasn't until I purchased ""Yoga For Yourself"" that I finally learned that my body can relax and exercise at the same time.  You don't have to be a size 2 model or yogi master to perform these poses, and Richmond's calm encouragement actually made me want come back to this DVD every day.

Another plus to this workout is the length. It's hard enough to find the time to eat something besides Chinese take-out or a hamburger to-go, let alone work a grueling exercise routine into a busy day.  This video is less than a half hour long, and can be fit around a busy woman's schedule.

8263513,1,B0016NOUY2,This is my least favorite workout DVD. I returned it almost as soon as I opened it. The graphics are horrible. Many shots are taken from a far angle so it makes the poses difficult to see. Also I felt that there wasn't much guidance throughout the DVD. This was very poor quality.,1370476800,,280,4.30188679245283
8263514,5,B0016NOUY2,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to give ""Yoga for Yourself"" a chance, and I'm so glad I did. It's the perfect video for someone like me who is looking for a way to ease into yoga without having to take a class. I was always in good shape when I was younger, but now as I enter middle age, it's been harder to find time to exercise or the money for a health club membership. I jog and do Zumba when I have time but my body now needs something more gentle and yet effective. My hips had been hurting for months and I figured I'd just have to live with the discomfort, but this video taught me how to stretch them. The pain has disappeared! No surgery, no medication. Just the cost of the video and the commitment to 30 minutes every other day. I feel so relaxed after doing the stretches. I'm very happy with the results and grateful to ""Yoga for Yourself.""",1332201600,2,864,4.179640718562874
8263515,4,B0016NOUY2,"I like this one. The poses & approach weren't too advanced or intimidating.  Some yoga instructors seem to assume that their entire audience is thin and flexible and healthy, which can be very alienating for anyone who isn't.  Ann generally demonstrates each pose first with a prop or in its easier version, and then shows the advanced version, which encourages newbies to actually work at their individual levels instead of hurting themselves by taking on more than their bodies are ready for.

I also really liked the setting--it could have been a river near my home town: attractive, but not spectacular. It wasn't pink sand beaches under a turquoise sky in Maui, and I think that's great.  When you're trying to pick up a new exercise routine, you need to believe that this is something you can actually assimilate into your real life, and, unfortunately, pink sand beaches play very little part in my daily life :-(  Perfect people on a perfect beach by a perfect ocean just depress me.

On the con side, there's only one ~30-min routine on the DVD and no notable extras.  I'd have liked one or two more routines for the money.  I also have difficulty matching my breathing to Ann's (I have this problem with all yoga DVDs, to be fair)--it would be really helpful if there were some sort of visual or auditory cue in the background or off to the side to help me manage my breathing.

But overall, I like the poses, setting, and general attitude, so this one is fast becoming part of my regular rotation of yoga DVDs.",1279324800,4,1521,4.62453531598513
8263516,5,B0016NOUY2,"I am relatively new to yoga and was pleased at how comfortable I felt following along with the poses in this video.  As I progress, I'm sure I'll be able to do them better, but for now, it was easy to follow her instructions and adapt the poses to my beginner level.  In the past, when I have attended yoga classes at the rec center, I always felt a little stressed out because the instructor would call out yoga positions such as ""warrior,"" etc. and I'd never know what to do, so I'd be behind everyone else.  This video doesn't use those terms necessarily--it just explains nicely using words (and of course the visual of the instructor) what to do with your body.  I also found the instructor's voice and explanations to be very conducive to relaxation.  I am now trying to convince my husband to join me!  :)",1277164800,2,812,4.416107382550336
8263517,2,B0016NOUY2,"I bought this DVD based on the excellent reviews, and was quite a bit disappointed with it. I have quite a collection of yoga programs prepared by some well-known professionals in this field (Suzanne Deason, Alan Finger, Rodney Yee), and by comparison the Yoga for Yourself DVD is highly amateurish, both from the instructional and visual points of view. Absolutely no instructions are given regarding the proper alignment of the body and how to get in and out of the poses, it is a see-and-copy routine, which is not what a yoga practice is about. The routine itself is a very standard combination of the basic yoga poses (sun salutations, lunges, twists and bends), nothing special here.

My second complaint is about the scenery and camerawork. The instructor (or rather presenter, in this case) is filmed from a large distance, no close-ups, you can't even make out the face of the woman. The scene is set up on a bank of a dark gloomy river with overgrown trees, the background colors are joyless dark green, brown and gray. The lady is dressed all in black, she is very gaunt and seems pale and melancholic. All this is also very different from the usual light, airy settings for yoga programs, often filmed in breathtakingly beautiful places, which is very important for achieving the overall calming, uplifting and energizing effect.

There are so many superior yoga programs available, I'm sure I'll never go back to this one.",1274486400,3,1435,4.853061224489796
8263518,5,B0016NOUY2,"I have suffered from anxiety my entire life and more recently depression. I have seen therapists, psych docs, read books, etc. Nothing helped the way I needed them to. I would find things that would help but never fully made me happy. Anyway, I am a christian and was concerned with a lot of other yoga DVD's that practice non christian meditation. That is why I descided to try this one. There is nothing religous about this DVD. However, it is very, very relaxing (when my 3 year old isn't climbing on me or under me durring the poses). I love that thru each pose she tells you what it is good for. I am new to yoga and have always heard that it was good for anxiety and many other things as well but to have each pose explaind briefly and calmly was perfect for me. There are even certain poses to help ease menstral cramps or help if you have infertility problems. It's also convenient to know what each pose is good for so if you don't have time to do the whole video (which is only about a half and hour) you can do just the poses that are best for your particular condition or situation. Sometimes I have a hard time getting motivated but I will put the DVD in anyway and to hear what the differant poses are doing for me makes me feel great that I am helping myself in my recovery. It's empowering. I feel relaxed but energized after I do this video. I would highly recomend this to anyone interested in yoga. Pobably not the best for the more experienced but certainly to anyone new to it. I hope you enjoy. I am.",1267747200,4,1522,4.233676975945017
8263519,5,B0016NOUY2,"A mellow, life-affirming half-hour workout which proves that you don't have to overtax yourself to get the benefits of yoga. As a total newbie (I had taken one class before buying this DVD), I *loved* this routine. It taught me the most important lesson of all: Yoga is calming and grounding. Whenever I do this workout, I feel centered and envigorated for the entire day.

Ann has a very soothing, mellow voice and a relaxed approach to teaching which encourages good form and attention to your body--but doesn't take a perfectionist approach which causes you to stress out overly. Unlike some other videos which claim to be for beginners but aren't really, this DVD keeps it simple and focuses the instruction on the types of things that are most helpful when you are first starting. For example, she explains never to push yourself and that you can gently push further into each pose with the exhale.

If you are considering buying other ""beginner"" DVDs, I suggest this one first so you can get a good solid start and feel encouraged and uplifted--rather than clumsy and stupid. Some of the other DVDs (such as Natasha's) are not for real beginners and if you try them too early you will just become frustrated.

I enjoy the music on this DVD, and also I like the setting in the swamp which another reviewer found distracting. My one criticism is that Ann spends a lot of time during the workout talking about the supposed benefits of each pose. For me, that was annoying and distracted from my enjoyment of the poses. I would have preferred that the part about benefits be a separate section on the DVD so you can just enjoy the workout and music without having to listen to it again and again! Who knows what science she uses to back up all the claimed benefits, but in any case it is obvious from doing the video only once that it feels *great* so who really cares about anything else?",1265587200,3,1891,4.588757396449704
8263520,3,B0016NOUY2,"The exercises are very good, there is a little too much space around the figure and the figure becomes distant and small, not enough closeup details and too much scenery shown in the photography during the exercises.
The DVD skips in some area and I have to fast forward to the next chapter.",1265414400,,291,4.509433962264151
8263521,3,B0016NOUY2,"Like others have said on their reviews, this video is great for stay-at-home moms, or moms often on-the-go.  It's short enough to squeeze into your day without getting hot and sweaty, but long enough to feel like you've accomplished something.  It's very relaxing and you definitely feel stretched after.  The voice-over is very nice and soothing.  She also explains why the positions are beneficial.

My reason for 3 stars, are my personal opionions, which others may not have a problem with.  The yoga instructor does waaaaaaaayyyyyyy too many arm lifts.  Reach up to the sky and inhale, breathe out and lower your arms.  It's ok at first, but after doing the DVD just 4 times, I've already had it with that part.  She does it over and over and over.  It almost feels like a time-filler.

The other thing I don't like about this DVD, which may sound very trivial, but it actually inhibits my work-out because it bothers me so much, is the setting.  Maybe it's because I'm used to yoga instructors on sandy beaches or studios, but where she does her work-out gives me the willies!  It's like she's sitting in the middle of a damp swamp!  I keep imagining mosquitioes buzzing all around her!  Also, it's pretty dreary and dismal, like it wants to rain.  Like I said, this may sound trivial to some, but I'm a very visual person, so this actually affects my work-out.

For a beginner, or woman (I don't think a man would benefit doing keigel exercises!!!) with little time on her hands, I'd recommend this as ok.  For now, I'm partial to Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden.",1254182400,5,1568,4.64
8263522,5,B0016NOUY2,"This is a very easy exercise to follow. The moves are simple, fluid and explained very well. You are even instructed/encouraged not to over do it several times during the exercise. I don't feel overwhelmed trying to maintain poses. This is excellent for beginners and anyone who is not flexible, just make sure you have the props required to achieve all of the positions. The 'props' can be anything you have on hand at home or you can purchase them. You need a yoga block (I used a book), a strap (I used a thin towel) and, of course, your yoga mat. The mat is essential because it keeps you from sliding.....something that is very dangerous when you are trying to maintain your pose. I tried on my carpet at first but found it to be very uncomfortable trying to remain steady in a pose. The mats are inexpensive and will help keep you safe. Good Luck!",1252713600,4,853,4.439490445859873
