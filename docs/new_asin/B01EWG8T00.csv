8759693,3,B01EWG8T00,"OK.  Here's the deal.

This movie was filmed in 1955 Czechoslovakia, which, having a Communist Government controlling their film industry produced propaganda.

If you want to look at a mid-'50's example of Communist Propaganda - this would do nicely.  It's got all the elements of most Communist Propaganda films and thus serves as a good example of the type.

Now ... the other reason for interest in this film - is all that German Equipment that was still around for use as props.  It's got functioning Mk IV's, Mk V's that could at least fire the gun and some Stug III's.  The uniforms may well have been actual German Army issue.  There's a few nice shots of MP43/44's and of course the MG-42's.  There is also what looks to be a Bf-109 in a very brief shot during a strafing run.

Then there's the Russian equipment and there's ton's of that.  Lots and lots of footage of T-34/85's, burp guns, light machine guns, US trucks and US Jeeps (which the Soviets received in large numbers).

So - if you like to look at film footage of WWII equipment - there's a lot of that here, you just have to endure the propaganda parts that make up most of the film.",1461110400,,1154,4.442857142857143
