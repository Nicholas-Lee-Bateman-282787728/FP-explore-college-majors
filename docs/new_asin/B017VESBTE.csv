8740812,5,B017VESBTE,"This 1959 Playhouse-90 production was a solid precursor to the classic 1961 movie with Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Maximillian Schell, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Montgomery Clift, and yes, a young William Shatner.  Although both productions were masterfully written by Abbe Mann, I don't think the TV version has the power of the movie for several reasons, not the least of which being its 90-minute duration vs. over 3 hours for the movie.  Paul Lukas does a good job as the chief German judge, Ernst Janning in the TV show, but I thought Burt Lancaster's performance in the 1961 film to be especially powerful and memorable in many ways.  Maximillian Schell deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his work but Burt deserved more credit than he got, as might be said for Spencer Tracy and the others noted above. (Maybe Spencer and Burt cancelled each other out in the supporting actor category?)  In any case, the TV production with Claude Rains as the American judge Haywood was a good start in showing the story, although sound quality in my dvd was odd.  I had to turn the sound down to less than half of what I usually use or risk being blown out of the room.  Anyone interested in World War II and the Nuremberg trials needs to see this 1959 TV show.  And then re-watch the 1961 movie, with special attention to the courtroom scenes where Burt Lancaster speaks and Maximillian Schell tries to rationalize the behavior of the German judges.  Just unforgettable dialogue there and at the end between Lancaster, as Ernst Janning, and Tracy, as the American judge Haywood.  ""I never thought it would come to that,"" said judge Janning when pressed about the Nazi atrocities.  Response from judge Haywood: ""But it came to that, Herr Janning, the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.""  Stunning words indeed.",1468972800,5,1862,4.80564263322884
