7820741,5,6302035546,This movie has really held up over the years. The music is a breathing heartbeat to the film. The acting is terrific - though some scenes of a sexual nature made me uncomfortable but are so well acted I can appreciate their place in the film. Kudos especially to Elizabeth Daily and Ned Glass. The plot about efforts to save the Victory Hotel in San Francisco's Tenderloin district is what drew me to the film in the first place and is what has brought me back to it after many years spent in the belief that property belongs to those who make a life wherever they land by accepting their neighbors as friends and living cooperatively in peace.,1426982400,,644,4.466101694915254
