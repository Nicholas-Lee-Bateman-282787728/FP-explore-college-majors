4174271,5,B003R0MF6W,"Those who enjoyed Everwood are guaranteed to love Life Unexpected. At first I tuned in because I was a fan of Kerr Smith and Shiri Appleby from Dawson's Creek and Roswell, respectively. However, now the whole cast are on my ""to watch"" list. I didn't like the character of Lux at first, she was an immature brat, but she grew on me. Tasha only became liked right at the end of s2, and I've always HATED Bug. We get to see Lux and her birth parents mature. We see them struggle with their emotions, and both parents lie to each other about their love for the other. S2 had a controversial storyline involving a student/teacher relationship that many harped about. I personally liked it, it was written maturely and done tastefully. Perhaps it was because I was a fan of the teacher's portrayer, Shaun Sipos, from the remake of Melrose Place (which definitely deserved another season, hello- 90210 is TERRIBLE!) Anyway, the CW president has never made a good decision, which is why LUX was cancelled. It definitely deserves to be seen and reminisced about for years to come. After all, when was the last decent family oriented show on, 2004, 2005???",1301961600,,1146,4.678217821782178

4174273,5,B003R0MF6W,"Let me start by saying that I am an avid TV-watcher. I watch shows of all kinds, on many different channels. This show was by far the best new show of 2010, and the best new show on the CW since One Tree Hill-- yes, I know One Tree Hill is no longer a ""good show,"" but when it first came out, it was original, intriguing, and had great characters. Otherwise I would say it's the best new show on the CW since Gilmore Girls. It was more like a WB show than one you'd find among the bikinis, vampires and rich kids on the CW.
All of the characters are (I say ""are"" because I still refuse to believe it's cancelled) quirky, endearing and relatable. The concept of the show is original, and the way it is executed is fast-paced enough without getting confusing. Although it sometimes seems like the same issues come up over and over again in every episode, it doesn't get annoying. It's realistic in that these issues WOULD come up again and again for a family like this. A quirky family of one slightly neurotic radio host who's afraid of marriage, one lovable co-host who proposes to her in the pilot and then deals with all of her insecurities, a bartender who has yet to fully grow up, and a famously knit-hat-wearing sixteen-year-old who comes back into their lives after the Cate, the radio host, put her in foster care after telling Baze, the bartender, that she'd had an abortion. Together they work through it and become the most interesting family television has seen... well, ever.
The season two finale was absolutely perfect and tied up all the loose ends, just in case it does get officially cancelled by the CW (in which case, I believe it deserves a proper memorial, for we will probably never again see such a quality show on such a horrible network).",1300665600,,1764,4.4813664596273295
4174274,4,B003R0MF6W,"Note: this review contains some spoilers.

Life Unexpected is set in Portland, Oregon and tells the story of sixteen-year-old year old girl Lux (played by Britt Robertson) and her journey to gain family and relationships. Lux has spent all of her life in foster care, moving from one foster home to another. She and best friend Natasha (also sixteen) are sick of foster care and are looking to get emancipated so that they can be independent and move in with their boyfriends. However, to get the ball rolling for herself Lux has to get signatures from both of her birth parents approving her emancipation. Lux tracks down her birth father Nathan `Baze' Bazile (played by Kristoffer Polaha) who runs a bar (and lives above it with two of his friends) and discovers that her birth mother is Cate Cassidy (played by Shiri Appleby of Roswell fame), co-presenter of radio station K-100's hit show Morning Madness alongside her boyfriend Ryan Thomas (played by Kerr Smith of Dawson's Creek fame). It transpires that Baze got Cate pregnant in high school (after senior prom) and Lux was the result. But at the time Baze was a self-absorbed young man and did nothing to support Cate. Cate then gave Lux up for adoption because she felt that she was too young to be a mother. When Lux now appears in Cate and Baze's lives 16 years later (they are now in their early thirties) Cate and Baze discover that Lux was never adopted because she had a hole in her heart when she was a baby which made her undesirable to prospective adopters. Hence Lux has spent her entire life in the foster care system, which Cate and Baze feel very guilty about. They want to do everything possible to help Lux's life get better so agree to sign the forms approving her emancipation and accompany her to the hearing in court. But when the day comes for the hearing, the judge does not approve Lux's emancipation and instead grants Cate and Lux joint custody of Lux. However Cate will be the primary caregiver due to the fact that she has a stable job and a house. And so Lux enters into her new `family'.

Much of season 1 concerns the dynamics of the fact that Lux's birth parents are not together. There is a love triangle: Cate is in a serious relationship with Ryan but may have feelings for Baze and vice versa. Meanwhile Ryan feels that Baze interferes in his and Cate's relationship and feels threatened, seeing Baze as a rival whilst Baze feels that Ryan is trying to take his place as Lux's father (indeed at one point Cate and Ryan conspire to try and shut Baze out of Lux's life). Meanwhile Lux is trying to fit into school and make friends, to try to be a `normal' teenager, to deal with drama with her boyfriend Bug and to adapt to her new parental (Cate and Baze) and step-parental (Ryan) relationships. There is also the largely painful story of Baze's relationship with his father.

Season 2's plotting is even more intricate: Lux enters into a secret and illegal relationship with her English teacher Eric Daniels (played by Shaun Sipos) who is seven years older than her and the outplaying of this relationship and its consequences drives much of the season. Other major plot strands are the sharp ups and downs in Cate and Ryan's young marriage (the wedding took place at the end of season 1) because they seem unable to be completely honest with each other, Baze going to work for his dad's financial company and him and his boss Emma Bradshaw (played by Emma Caulfield) falling in love with each other and the revelation that Lux was seriously and horrifically abused by one of her foster parents whilst she was still in foster care, an experience that affected her emotionally and neurologically. On top of this Cate and Ryan become custodians of Natasha (Lux's best friend) and in an act of benevolence get her her own flat. Meanwhile Baze's up and down relationship with his father continues.

Across the two seasons Life Unexpected was really good. My biggest complaint was that there were only two seasons and each one only had 13 episodes, meaning only 26 episodes in total. I would have liked to have seen this series run for years. My favourite character was possibly Baze due to his charisma, the way he bonded with his newly found teenage daughter Lux and the way he changed over the course of the two seasons. I was also fond of Cate Cassidy: a flawed but strangely endearing character. Ironically I found Lux the main protagonist often annoying, in fact, more often annoying than not. But bizarrely this didn't undermine Life Unexpected at all as the storytelling was just so solid and the characters and their interactions so compelling. Besides, you don't like everyone in real life! Ryan Thomas was also an excellent character and I found the telling of the story of the ups and downs of his and Cate's relationship and subsequently marriage one of the most absorbing things about the series. Nonetheless this was the story of Lux and her `family tree' (see the opening theme near the start of each episode) and running as a wonderful theme throughout the two series was the truth that no matter what Lux did (and she does a lot) or however much she tested and tried her parents (especially Cate) they would never let go of her because they loved her. I would have given this DVD box set five stars if not for a slightly contrived part of the ending of the final episode of season 2. But this is in truth a minor quibble as Life Unexpected makes for excellent and very rewarding viewing. You will be sad when it's over.",1297900800,,5525,4.6232179226069245
4174275,5,B003R0MF6W,"Finally an amazing show that shows what LIFE really is about. But CW wants to cancel it and make ALL there teen Crappy Dramas work. I have watch One Tree Hill since the beginning and I got hooked to many shows within those eight years, but after just one season they would cancel it. Then Life Unexpected came along and Kerr Smith was what got me to start watching it, but it was the whole cast and story lines that kept me tuned in each week to see what Lux was going to do next. Once I heard that the series was picked up for season 2, I was relieved because I thought that the CW had FINALLY took there heads out of there ASSes. But looks like they will never change. Hopefully they will give this GREAT show another chance or maybe another station will get the balls to pick it up, just don't cancel it. On the Final Episode of season two you gave us what ten mins of the future, well I want to see those two years unfold. I want to see Kate and Ryan breakup and how Nate got Kate to come back. What brought Lux to Jones and how everyone else got together. I want too see, NO Im dying to see the two years that they teased us with. This Show is real and make you look at life in that unexpected way. Hence the Title ""Life Unexpected"". People Get a clue and don't ruin this great show. Hell look at One Tree Hill, they had crappy ratings yet eight seasons later there still around.",1297123200,,1384,4.091911764705882
4174276,5,B003R0MF6W,"(Warning, I rant):
I pray that with good dvd sales and better ratings from reruns that the CW does not cancel this show. I am so sick of getting wrapped into great shows that get canceled before their time. I believe this show deserves another season. (small spoiler I am about to say) If the show did not introduce the sort of student-teacher relationship drama, the show would have done much better because parents did not approve of that. Now that it is over, then maybe ratings could be better. It will be a whole new set up too, college life! As a college student, I would like to watch that. The two other shows with college are so different from what this could be. Greek is about the Greek system and is extremely bubbly, there is not a person like Lux; Gossip Girl is not even about college, it is just NY rich kid drama.

The actual review:
ANYWAYS, watch Life Unexpected. It is about a girl, Lux, who was given up at birth and at 16 finds her parents. Due to medical issues, she was never adopted and grew up in the system. Her father, Nathaniel ""Baze"", owns a bar, and her mother, Kate Cassidy, is a radio talk show host. Lux coming back into their lives forces them all to grow up, a little. A little bit of Gilmore Girls banter vibe, but it is still so different from other shows.
At the very least Netflix it.",1295827200,18,1324,4.296
4174277,4,B003R0MF6W,"I think this show has great acting and writing, and interesting, complex characters who are struggling to overcome their character defects. To me, that is what great characterization is all about. Sadly, I see so little of it today in novels, movies and on TV; and so I loved the first season of Life Unexpected, especially because I also felt there was a moral side to the show: people trying to do the right thing in spite of their character defects.

Then the second season of the show started and Lux got involved in an illegal relationship with her teacher, Mr. Daniels. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but a teacher having a sexual relationship with an underage girl should be taboo on a family/young adult TV show, especially when the characters involved - Lux and Mr. Daniels - don't seem to have any strong quilt or misgivings. The moral aspect of the show went out the window. Suddenly, watching the show was difficult for me. If I had kids I certainly wouldn't want them to watch.

What I don't understand is why the show's producers chose to go down the road they did.  To me, Life Unexpected would have been much better if Lux had a crush on her teacher, and though he was attracted to her, he fought his feelings and never crossed the line, and instead became a positive influence on her.",1295481600,10,1295,4.549356223175966
4174278,5,B003R0MF6W,"This has been my absolute favorite show.  I hated to see the last show that appeared to be a series finale.  I'm going to miss the characters, actors, and story lines.  I recorded this every week and haven't missed a week.  Boo to CW if they're cancelling this show.",1295395200,7,266,4.36734693877551
4174279,5,B003R0MF6W,I'm like everyone else - can't believe CW cancelled this show.  It's well-written and has outstanding performances by the entire cast.  There are few shows that can boast the same quality as this show has had throughout its run and those that are this good are usually cancelled too early so there are no DVDs available.  At least LU had enough episodes to put out a DVD so I can enjoy it any time without clogging up my DVR.,1293580800,3,425,4.3544303797468356
4174280,5,B003R0MF6W,"I cannot believe CW cancelled this show.  I watch it every week and it least it has a good story line.  I guess it is true--if the storyline isn't ridiculous, the show gets cancelled.  The characters were all so interesting.  My whole family (kids & grandkids)loved this show.  This was one of the very few shows on TV that the whole family could enjoy together.  I guess they'll put another cop show on to replace this and the kids can watch everyone killing each other.",1292025600,22,471,4.482352941176471

4174371,3,B003R0MF6W,It's ok. Not sure why they think a 20 year old can pull off being a 16 year old. Not sure why CBS gave this 2 year show a finale and did nothing for Judging Amy.,1483488000,,161,3.5
4174372,5,B003R0MF6W,I know the writers probably didn't have that much notice that the show was ending and that really showed in the last episode how fast it wrapped up.

4174428,3,B003R0MF6W,"While I get that the premises have to be far-fetched in order to make a show interesting, the repeating cycle of a teen lying about where they are and parents repeatedly believing the lie is laughable. This show is typical CW fair, though it does take a little higher moral ground than some of their other shows targeted at teens. But I do tire of the CW promoting alcohol to minors, every episode includes someone drinking more than average, and many times the adults allowing their children to do so as well.

Else, this show is pretty mundane. They don't really touch on any topics that could be divisive and focus almost entirely on dating. The topics of foster children is poorly portrayed.

4174487,4,B003R0MF6W,"It's pretty good. Not believable in many instances, but pretty good. I know of other shows with the same not - quite - five - star tendency: they write teenage characters who regularly outscore the adults in maturity, without sufficient explanation for this very rare anomaly. When conflict resolution appears in the plot, the teenagers are forward-looking and selfless, while the adults lack any such virtues. I would not necessarily suggest a reversal of those roles. In reality, adults often fall short as well. But writing a teenager who was raised in multiple foster homes, yet who regularly out-wises the adults around her requies some substantiation in the back story. Mind you, because of the good things about the show,  I overlook this flaw and watch it anyway.",1465344000,,771,5.0234375

4174502,3,B003R0MF6W,"Same as Season 1, this show proves to me ( my wife reminds me of that as well) that I am too ""serious-minded"" & place  way too much value on authenticity. It's been a while since I was a ""30-Something"", but I'm sure I wasn't  anywhere as close to immature as these folks are. They all seem to exercise serious lack of good judgement & place little value on honesty. I know, that is what the show is about, right?
The producers need to work a bit more on authenticity & realism, as they include way too many ""Who does that?"" scenarios. for example, 1.""Why would a ""Talk Radio"" station promote a ""Music Concert""? Music is not their format! Are they promoting their competition? 2. Where does a woman normally keep their birth control pills? The night stand, the medicine Cabinet or just in carry them in their purse so their husband can easily discover that she is taking them when they are supposed to trying to have a baby? Really?
I know, Too Serious minded!
The show is also painfully predictable.  But, my wife likes it, that is why I watch it with her and it does provide something fluffy for me to complain about in in a ""Tongue & cheek"" manner and something to criticize . Plus, I can also write these reviews @ 2:30 a.m. when my insomnia has sitting at my computer instead of sleeping .
But, it is commercial-free,contains no violence nor profanity, and one can take a bathroom break with-out worrying about missing some critical scene. Maybe it is just just what one needs at the end of a stressful day and needs to shift their brain into neutral!",1463184000,,1555,4.4491228070175435

The biggest let-down was the ending, which abruptly jumped ahead two years and wrapped everything up in a pretty bow.

I liked the part where her dad finally started to grow up, but her mom was still behaving like a teenager - a bit ridiculous. (Remember that the series' premise was that all the grownups acted like teenagers while Lux and Tasha were the adults.) I'm glad that the writers had some notice that there wasn't going to be a 3rd season, so the final 10 minutes of the final episode wrapped up a lot of things with a '2 years later' summary.

And then Lux getting her boyfriend back?  I thought he was with BFF Tasha.  God, Tasha railroaded once again. 4-stars for the pilot.

The chances that a white female baby made available for adoption in this country in the last 4omyears would grow up in foster care approach zero. She would have been adopted at birth. That's problem one. Problem 2, is that the portrayal of the foster mother as doing it just for the money is a disservice to a lot of caring foster mothers. Problem 3 is that if you give your child up for adoption your signature is not needed on any emancipation papers and problem 5 is that I know of a number of reunions of adopted kids with their bio parent and none of them has been as uneventdpful as is pirtrayed here.

4174766,4,B003R0MF6W,"I  live vicariously through these characters.  Young, hip, smart, good-looking, live in great homes and have cool jobs.  Maybe their lives are somewhat of a train wreck, but they look good in the midst of the wreckage. And because it's TV you know they'll redeem themselves in the end.  Plus it's set in Portland and I have a strong fondness for hipster Portland.  The story premise is unique--Britt Robertson as the teen: Lux, who was shuffled from foster home to foster home somehow discovers her birth parents: Cate Cassidy (played by Shiri Appleby) and Nate Bazile (""Baz"") (played by Kristoffer Polaha).  Cate and Baz had a one night stand in high school which resulted in Cate's pregnancy with Lux.  Cate doesn't know Lux was put into the foster care system.  And now as a 16 year old teen Lux is seeking legal emancipation, but  instead a judge awards custody of Lux to the parents.  Lux lives with Kate and visits Baz who runs a bar.  Kate is a morning radio host and lives in a really cool Craftsman type home.  See? Cool houses, and cool jobs!  I watch this show for the scenery and sets as much as the acting!  As a teen with a lot of emotional baggage Britt Robertson plays it spot on.  You really feel the rollercoaster she lives on of angst, mistrust, but longing to be loved and accepted as she tries to figure out her place in the world and get to know her parents.  I'm a big fan of Shiri Appleby.  I just think she's completely adorable. As a young mother thrust into the role of mothering a teenage child she doesn't know, she delivers a credible performance.  She is vunerable and sensitive, but firm and mature. She's a contrast to the fun-loving, ""Peter Pan"" character of Baz, who is really a guy that grows up along with Lux and while his antics and behavior in real life would personally drive me nuts, he's quite likeable and eventually grows up to reveal the true man beneath the playboy veneer. Plus he's pretty cute and easy on the eyes.  The supporting characters round out the show and I actually like all of them for different reasons.  This show tackles some heavy subjects and you will find yourself rooting for the characters while thinking ""what in the world were they thinking by doing that?""  And yes, I mentioned it's set in Portland (although most of the show was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia) but because I love the Pacific Northwest this detail particularly enthralls me.  It has that  ""hipster"" Portland vibe without being too hippy.  Watch it, you'll like it.  I wish it had been extended for a few more seasons, but in doing that they would have had to figure out what to do with the characters because the writers sewed up the story very neatly in two seasons. But I miss it anyway.",1409270400,,2733,4.539877300613497

A lot of sneaky social comments on the US urban society hidden under an entertaining sitcom.

4174789,3,B003R0MF6W,"The show is generally entertaining, but what gets tiresome is the pull-push pattern of the story line. The characters are constantly scolding, criticizing, blaming and pushing each other away, then regretting it when they need each other and pull these people close again, only to repeat the same pattern over and over.

This pattern makes the show very predictable and these constant scolding ""insightful"" conversations get increasingly harder to listen to. The main character Lux seems to be the most critical of all, and ungrateful as well as disrespectful towards her newly found parents, who are trying very hard to please her and do the right thing. She is a very cute teen, but her personality is real bit..y for the whole first season.

There is also a huge amount of analyzing and self-analyzing at every episode, most of the time in a negative way, which also gets repetitive and tiresome to listen to. In real life people talk to each other this way occasionally, but not all the time, like in this show. Everyone seems so immature and self involved.

I think the main audience for this show is teenagers or people in their early twenties, anyone else will find it a bit annoying.",1376352000,,1191,4.8

I first saw her in the Roswell series and fell in love with her and her character. I have already watched Life Unexpected through to the end and I am currently watching it again. This show has a great cast and the episodes are well written. I'm not normally into family dramas but I find this show to be captivating, I love the characters and look forward to re-watching it again many times in the future.

I'm not one the gush about tv shows (don't really even watch a lot of tv) but this show was really something special! I think that it is an absolute travesty that the show was cancelled after only two seasons! So glad I bought the series on DVD!

4174854,5,B003R0MF6W,"I stumbled into the short series Life Unexpected one evening when surfing Netflix for a good movie.

Mild Spoiler Alert: The context is a teenager seeks out her biological parents to sign her emancipation papers so she can take herself out of the foster care system so she can raise herself as she sees appropriate. Her father never realized she had been born; her mother had been assured she would be adopted as a baby but asks ""who wants a broken child?"" as she was reportedly born with a heart defect requiring a number of operations in her early life. Surprising everyone, the judge grants temporary joint custody to both parents believing the parents are NOT drug abusers and otherwise seem to have stable lives.  The teen has already spent 16 years caring for herself despite the attempts of the foster care system, many conflicts arise from the teen who considers herself as an adult and the adults who are still experience bouts of immaturity.

Life Unexpected is a fun show that had me absolutely rolling by the 3rd episode!",1353196800,,1033,4.727777777777778

I really was able to feel the characters and connect with them and all the good and bad points.  Not many shows captivate my imagination and attention anymore but this is simply an amazing one.  I think the writing is grade A, along with the acting.  Of course it was a bit cheesy sometimes, but then there were also gritty part where you just hold your breath and wait to see if that is truly whats going to happen.

4174860,5,B003R0MF6W,"I found this series on Netflix actually, and the reviews on here just made me wanna see it more so I went ahead and played the first episode.  After that I was hooked and could not tear myself away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cannot believe that the CW network had this phenomenal show in their line up, only to make the big mistake of cancelling it after just a mere two seasons and 26 episodes!!!!  In my opinion, this is a good way to lose their fan base.  They did this to another amazing show in the past, and I thought that they had learned their lesson; this just goes to show you that they have not.
  It was obvious to me that on the last episode, they knew it to be their last so the writers did a last minute rewrite to give it the best send off that they possibly could for the characters.  I guarantee that had this show been given the opportunity like all the crap that is on tv today to last for a few more seasons, it would've had a more fulfilling ending than this did.  Not that it wasn't fulfilling, it was.  It just wasn't supposed to end so soon and I think that the audience knew it came far sooner than it was deserved.  That's the only slightly bad thing I have to say about this show and it isn't even enough for me to knock it down a star.  This wasn't the shows fault.  It was a true diamond in the rough.  But instead the CW Network decided to give this show the boot and keep all this other crap on the air instead.  A poor mistake on their end.  It's hard to find a really decent show with heart, not to mention wit these days.  Then if you're lucky a show like this will come along only be cancelled long before it actually should have been.
  In simple english, if you've not seen this show you really should.  I was hooked simply by the first episode and was sad when I had to turn if off for one day and wait till the next night to watch it again.  It is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Britt Robertson is a very talented woman and I expect we'll definitely be seeing her in much more soon to come.  As if she doesn't have a track record already....she's one of the few great actresses we have in Hollywoood.",1341446400,16,2133,4.178921568627451

The tagline ""Gilmore girls meets Juno"" is an accurate description, and its what first got me interested in the show, as I'm a huge Gilmore girls fan and I love the movie Juno.

As for the DVD itself, I was extremely pleased to learn that the first and second season both came together, in the same box. For two seasons, it is a fabulous price and definitely worth the buy.

Go ahead and give it a try! You will not regret it, I promise.",1332201600,2,444,4.174418604651163
4174900,5,B003R0MF6W,"im happy to be getting this on dvd. i loved this show. the music was great, the actors were believable and the story grew and grew every week. Unfortionately people do not like to change up their tv schedule unless its to watch reality game shows or see whats going on with the cardashians.
  for anyone who didn't catch this gem when it was on its short time; Life Unexpected is about how a couple of 16 years old wound up with a baby after a night during the winter formal in the back of a mini van and the mother puts the baby up for adoption. 15 (almost 16 as lux would say) the would be dad wakes up to find their now ""almost 16"" year old bundle of joy knocking on his door wanting emancipation papers signed (though as you can probably guess she finds her way into their hearts before she can get the door slammed lol). It turns out that she was born with a heart condition and it was 3 years before she was able to leave the hospital so she wound up in the foster care system and got to spend her life bouncing from one bad home after the next. now baze (the dad) and kate (the mom) now in their early thirties who are very much broken up and their long lost daughter have to figure out what to do about it. new parents 16 years later and about as clueless as they can get and this kid is far from untouched by the foster care system. netflix refers to this show as emotional but don't let that make you turn away from it, its a drama but its not a tear fest. it is edgy on the other hand so you may not want young children watching it. its got kids drinking and having sex which happens but some may not want their kids seeing it on tv.

And, some of the characters are a bit hard to believe.  For example, most of the responses of the character ""Ryan"" don't seem ""understanding"" or ""insecure"" - they seem so beyond effeminate as to make it difficult to imagine this character wanting to marry someone of the opposite sex. But, other characters do seem somewhat ""real"" and the story line is interesting.",1315699200,2,535,4.793478260869565

Thank god that this show had enough episodes to release them on DVD, because is a MUST show to own on DVD. All the family can enjoy this show.",1307404800,9,574,4.4245283018867925
4174905,4,B003R0MF6W,"This was a FANTASTIC show.  The CW never gave it a fair shot.  They put all their marketing and promotion into the flashy shows about spoiled brats (90210 and Gossip Girl), when there was a whole new audience base out there that the CW could have marketed to.  This show, had it been well promoted or even just given FULL seasons, would have eventually pulled in viewers from all ages.  Viewers who liked Dawson's Creek or Gilmore Girls would have LOVED this show, and other than Parenthood, there is not much out there that offers the same ""family"" theme.  Life Unexpected dealt with real feelings and issues, ones that the average teenager and parent will face.

I really loved Season 1 and most of Season 2.  I really liked Baze, although I will say that I got really frustrated with all the blame and punishment Lux kept inflicting on Cate for giving her up for adoption without ever acknowledging the fact that Baze completely abandoned a 16-year-old Cate, even knowing she was pregnant.  I wish Baze had stepped in a few times and told Lux that he was as much to blame as Cate and she needed to treat Cate better.  As much as the Baze character evolved and grew throughout the series, he never really stood up for Cate, which is what I really wanted to see.  And really, Baze did a LOT of screwing up - more than Cate, really - but there were few effects on his relationships.

Cate, flawed and frequently annoying as she may be, was probably my favorite character.  Because despite the fact that she continually messes up, you can tell how guilty she feels about the past and how desperate she is to make it up to Lux.  Shiri Appleby does such a fantastic job with this character - you can both see and feel all of her conflicting emotions about all of her relationships.  On top of that, she jumped into being a mom from the moment she met Lux.  Baze was really more of a buddy to Lux for most of the series.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as it was a special relationship between him and Lux, but ultimately Cate took on the majority of true parenting.

Ryan was someone that you initially thought would be gone in a couple of episodes but he so quickly became a vital part of the cast that there was no way you could imagine the show without him.  Ryan is the voice of reason, the calm in the middle of the storm, and was Cate's rock (at least for most of the series) when Lux was constantly hurting her.

Season 2 was definitely more of a struggle than Season 1.  I never understood how Cate and Ryan's marriage deteriorated so incredibly quickly, and I really, really regretted that for so much of the season we lost the solidity of their relationship.  There was a moment, I forget which episode, when Baze, Ryan, Cate, and Lux were all playing basketball together as a family.  I really thought that was going to be the ultimate center of the show, but a lot of Season 2 revolved around very separate storylines.  There was little family interaction - instead, the focus was on Ryan/Cate, Baze/Emma, and Lux/Eric.  The key family interactions between Cate, Ryan, Baze, and Lux, all but disappeared.  So did the supporting cast (Math, Jaimie, Baze and Cate's families, etc).

In any event, this show had a truly unique and excellent premise and had so much promise in Season 1 and much of Season 2.  While I wish Season 2 had been more focused, that's something that could have been fixed and probably wouldn't have been so problematic if not for the fact that it wasn't a full season.

That said, I am not positive that I am going to buy this show on DVD.  The final episode largely ruined the series for me. Because it was originally filmed as a season finale, not a series finale, it was not originally designed to wrap up all the storylines.  However, once it became clear that the CW wasn't going to give this show the third season it deserved, the writers went back and did a 5 minute ""flash forward"" conclusion that turned everything you had JUST seen (seriously, just seconds before) upside down.  You literally go from seeing one character tell another than no matter what, all they want is to be with that person, that nothing can change that.  Then less than five minutes later, you flash forward and the couple is broken up.  Regardless of how you wanted things to turn out among the characters, there is no explanation, no closure on any of the relationships, no understanding of how they suddenly got to where they are in that last 5 minutes.  And not just relationships - I mean, all of Season 2 Lux is failing some classes and barely getting by in others, and suddenly she's up there giving a validictorian speech.  I felt as though everything I had invested in throughout the series was suddenly undone with not even a slight indication as to why or how.  I am not sure that I would be able to watch all the other fantastic episodes, knowing that it is going to all change so dramatically and quickly, but with no chance to ever see how those changes came about.

BUT for the majority of people out there, this probably wouldn't be a problem.  For those, I totally recommend this series.  Especially if you like Parenthood, and if you liked Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Everwood, or any other family-based dramadies, you will love this show!",1306800000,3,5279,4.511041009463723

The storyline sounded so awesome and it is!! I think this is one of the better shows that I have watched in a really long time. The characters have great chemisty together and it really shows in this series. I also cannot believe how well written this show it. I am totally addicted to Life Unexpected now. The first night I got the series I was only planning on watching a few of the episodes but they were so addicting that I stayed up til 2 am watching it. I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. It is true what the box says, this show is Juno meets Gilmore Girls which was another reason I purchased this series because I love both Juno and Gilmore Girls.

Short Summary:
Lux is an orphan who wants to get emancipated when she turns 16. She then discovers who her real parents are...Cate & Nate (AKA Baze). After she finds her parents there are several mishaps and a lot to learn about becoming parents and becoming a caring daughter. Can Cate and Nate give Lux the family that she needs and deserves?

I remember watching this show when it came on and somehow liked it; but, I do remember how disappointed I was to find out that it wouldn't go on for more seasons; though, I do have to say that these two seasons allows us to see how Lux goes from a teenager who thinks she has to be the adult and then transitions to knowing that she is just like every kid that has problems and that she can be a kid. Baze and Cate, Lux's biological parents, also go through growing pains when learning how to raise Lux, especially in learning how to raise a teenager and all that entails. Baze goes from being sort of like a man child to being an adult who takes care of things as an adult would. Cate heals from wounds of the past and also fully steps into the mom role as the show progresses. The show tackles on subjects of child abuse, student/teacher relations, the tough realities of the foster care system, the relationship of step-parent (Ryan) and step-child, etc. Other characters I loved on the show are Natasha aka Tasha, Jones, and Sam. Essentially, I would recommend watching two episodes per day, because the drama can be a bit much in watching many episodes back to back, but that is just me.",1487721600,,1281,4.38655462184874
