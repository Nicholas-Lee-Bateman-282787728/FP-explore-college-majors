8464945,1,B000NJWIQM,"Save your money, if you expect a series on vintage stock car racing - you'll be disappointed! I thought devoting one-third of this six (6) DVD set to early Dodge and Chrysler commercials and dealer sales information was a waste of money. Only two (2) of the six DVD's are related to early NASCAR, and while the vintage drag racing footage is pretty cool - my recommendation is to stay away if you want vintage stock car racing from the fifties, sixites, and seventies era.",1188518400,5,472,4.564705882352941
