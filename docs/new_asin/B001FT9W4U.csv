3589257,4,B001FT9W4U,I wanted to get this for Christmas but unfortunately it was sold out.  It's great & I would recommend it to anyone.,1392076800,,115,4.2272727272727275
3589258,4,B001FT9W4U,Anything by the Manhattan Transfer gets a minimum of 4 stars from me.  They are so talented and put on a great show.  But I was disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  The sound is uneven and the picture is grainy.,1391040000,8,216,4.095238095238095
3589259,2,B001FT9W4U,"I wanted the concert (not this version) which for whatever reason you decided not to ship.  I was very disappointed not to receive what I had chosen,",1387324800,,149,4.518518518518518
3589260,5,B001FT9W4U,"Vocal jazz has always been a favorite and this concert isn't just a Christmas special. They include many Christmas favorites, but they also go back to the beginnings of their career.  I bought this just to hear and see Janis Siegel and the gang tear it up once again on their first charting single in America, the gospel jamming ""Operator"".  I'm a ""Man-Tran"" fan from WAY back and this is awesome!",1386547200,,397,4.577464788732394
3589261,5,B001FT9W4U,"Because i'm a musician and I can really appreciate the work that they do.
I hear the chord changes and a lot of other things. Bravo MANHATTAN TRANSFER.",1385251200,,151,4.428571428571429
3589262,5,B001FT9W4U,"Most groups that have been around as long as these guys, start to lose it after 30+
years. Christmas has never been jazzier, or more heart felt in four part harmony
doo-wop style. Couldn't wait to add this to my collection, and it has always been
one of my favorite live recordings!",1344643200,2,282,4.4423076923076925

They make a whole heap of magic collectively as well as individually. For those who have seen this concert, SPOILER ALERT:  The late great Tim Hauser's rendition of ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" gave me a new respect for Charles Brown's cut of the tune...and for Tim himself. What else can I say? I simply loved it. Both that and the other three solos, one of which you just have to sing along to, right along with the audience. Like the New York Voices after and during them, the Transfer consists of genuine artists (who happen to be singers), and they truly come together, and work together as a strong, irresistible, familial unit that no music fan can go without. That audience did not go home empty-handed, and me neither. These mediocre mainstream kids we have got these days have got to learn. And yes, the DVD itself works like a charm.",1502755200,,1196,5.5
