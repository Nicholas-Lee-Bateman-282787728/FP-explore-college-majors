5620798,4,B00BGO4XFM,"Good film collection, but it comes in that crappy scratchable packaging. I'd rather have them all in individual blu-ray cases.",1383523200,8,126,5.35
5620799,4,B00BGO4XFM,"There are 20 Clint Eastwood films (15 films feature Eastwood while the other 5 showcase Eastwood in the director's chair) in this collection along with 2 DVD documentaries [the 90-minute Eastwood Factor Documentary (2010) and the 65-minute Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story Documentary (2013)]. Fans should know there aren't any spaghetti Westerns in this set. The films are in order of their theatrical debut (the two bonus discs round out the collection). The picture and audio quality vary by film but overall they are fairly average. Most but not all the films get at least 30 minutes of bonus content (e.g. The Gauntlet has no special features). A 48 page excerpt from Clint Eastwood: Master Filmmaker at Work is also included (the full 240-page book is sold separately).

The 20 films: A Perfect World, Dirty Harry, Every Which Way But Loose, Firefox, Gran Torino, Heartbreak Ridge, Hereafter, Invictus, J. Edgar, Letters from Iwo Jima, Magnum Force, Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, Pale Rider, Space Cowboys, Sudden Impact, The Gauntlet, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Trouble with the Curve, Unforgiven

There is another Clint Eastwood Collection on Blu-ray with 4 films not included here: Absolute Power, Kelly's Heroes, The Rookie and Where Eagles Dare. However, this 20-film collection is a much more comprehensive set of Eastwood's filmography (at least on Blu-ray). There is also a 40 film collection available on DVD. It seems that an Eastwood collection gets released every year. There are some minor complaints with this release in that we only get 3 out of 5 Dirty Harry films and notable films such as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Bronco Billy, Honkytonk Man, and The Bridges of Madison County are also absent. The determining factor seems to be that WB does not own the rights to the missing films (or they have yet to be released in HD). Also, this collection has book-style packaging so the discs do not get their own Blu-ray cases.

Buy the 20 Film Collection on Blu-ray. It is priced right if you don't own many Clint Eastwood films on Blu-ray.",1379894400,21,2068,4.953890489913545
5620800,4,B00BGO4XFM,"""Clint Eastwood 20 Film Collection"" is a 22-disc Blu-ray set containing films both starring and directed by Eastwood. It's a more affordable, if abbreviated, version of the massive 40-film DVD collection tribute released in 2010. The 20 pictures in the set represent both early and later Eastwood.

Eastwood began a relationship with Warner Bros. in 1975 with the signing of a long-term agreement. His Malpaso Productions moved onto the studio's Burbank lot and he eventually went on to win four Oscars and ten nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards for ""Unforgiven"" (1993) and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2005). He has also received five Golden Globes and numerous critics association and Lifetime Achievemnt awards.

Standouts in the collection are ""Dirty Harry,"" ""The Gauntlet,"" ""Firefox,"" and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" These roles illustrate the silent, no-nonsense, tough characters Eastwood specialized in before taking on roles as cantankerous curmudgeons.

The set also showcases Eastwood's ability to extract memorable performances from others in such films as ""Mystic River"" (Sean Penn), ""Invictus"" and ""Hereafter"" (Matt Damon), and ""Space Cowboys"" (Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland).

There are lesser Eastwood efforts in the set. ""Trouble With the Curve"" and ""A Perfect World,"" for example, aren't up to the actor's standard.  None of the spaghetti Westerns that established Eastwood as a big-screen star in the first place are included since they weren't Warner productions. This is an unfortunate omission.

Bonus extras include two feature-length documentaries.  ""The Eastwood Factor"" (2010), narrated by Morgan Freeman, profiles Eastwood's career and contains an interview with Eastwood himself.  ""Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story"" is a new documentary, available for the first time on Blu-ray  The film contains interviews with actors and producers who have worked with Eastwood discussing his body of work and his directing style.",1374364800,24,1977,5.6745762711864405
5620801,5,B00BGO4XFM,"This is must have for Clint Eastwood fan!!!

It has most of my favorite Clint Eastwood's films. I've been meaning to get ""A Perfect World"" and ""Space Cowboys"" blu-ray. They are included here!

I sold my other Clint Eastwood Collection Blu-ray version, so I can get this version. Movies missing in the new version that are in the old version are: Absolute Power, Kelly's Heroes, The Rookie and Where Eagles Dare. I bought Kelly's Heroes/Where Eagles Dare ActionDouble Feature Blu-ray for $6 so I'm good. The Rookie and Absolute Power are cheap and easy to find; I'll get them when I really want them.

Highly Recommend!",1371081600,6,618,4.811320754716981
5620802,3,B00BGO4XFM,"I bought this knowing what films were included (and not included), and I don't mind the book style holder (though many do). What I don't like is the outer box. It's flimsy plastic which won't hold up well. It also shows fingerprints everywhere and reflects glare. I can't hardly read the lettering as the coloring combined with the glare is not good. Why they didn't use a sturdy box like the Kubrick or Hitchcock collections that I own, I don't know. I do know that I'm returning this.",1370822400,3,486,4.534090909090909
5620803,3,B00BGO4XFM,"PART 1: THE FILMS

I will start by asserting that I think Clint Eastwood is one of the great actors in the history of film, and in the 1990s/early 2000s he had a nice run as director as well. I am a big fan of his career and admire him as a filmmaker.

Looking at the list of films included, I will say there's really no logic or particular theme to this box set. It's just a mix of films that Mr. Eastwood was involved in - sometimes he's the actor, other times he's the director. There are a large number of his great works included, but there are some glaring omissions as well.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
- In total, there are 20 feature films included in this collection. Although for those who want to see Eastwood on the screen, it's worth noting that he only appears in 15 of those films.
- All of his prestigious award winners are included here: ""Unforgiven"", ""Mystic River, ""Million Dollar Baby"", etc.
- Since this is the latest of many Eastwood box set, of course the studio is going to include his recent work that was not included in previous box sets. So you have ""Gran Torino"", ""Hereafter"", ""J. Edgar"", ""Invictus"", and ""Trouble with the Curve"". It's up to you whether these films warrant inclusion over some of Eastwood's more classic movies... I think some do and some don't.

WHAT'S MISSING:
- Films that you would think should be included here are not. For example, the box set has ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" - yet it's companion piece, ""Flags of Our Fathers"", is missing from the set.
- Eastwood's most famous character is Dirty Harry - but this set includes only 3 of the 5 films in that film series.
- ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", one of the Eastwood classics, is also absent. In fact, not a single one of the three Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns starring Eastwood is included. You can't fault Warner Bros for this because they do not own the rights to those particular films, but this set still feels incomplete without it.
- Other notable movies that are missing: ""In the Line of Fire"", ""Absolute Power"", and ""Changeling""

PART 2: BONUS CONTENT

There are two feature-length documentaries included:
1. ""The Eastwood Factor"" - produced in 2010, this is a profile of Eastwood's career. It is narrated by Morgan Freeman, and Eastwood participates in the film and is interviewed. This full documentary was previously released as bonus content on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hereafter-Blu-ray/dp/B0034G4OY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hereafter [Blu-ray</a>].
2. ""Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story"" - produced in 2013, this is a new documentary that has never been released on blu-ray. However, it can also be seen on television on TCM (the first broadcast is on Thursday May 30). The documentary features interviews with actors/producers that have worked with Eastwood, as they discuss his directing process and his body of work.

PART 3: PACKAGING

With this book-style packaging, they insert the discs into slots on the pages (rather than normal blu-ray cases), and this makes the discs less secure and more prone to scratches. I know this from experience - if you order this from an online retailer, you will likely have discs arrive loose. Check out reviews for the last big Eastwood DVD box set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clint-Eastwood-35-Films-35-Years-at-Warner-Bros/dp/B003X2P95I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years at Warner Bros.</a>. - as you will see, there are many customers that complain about this type of packaging because it very often damages the discs. It seems Warner Bros. has not learned their lesson in terms of disc packaging.

One nice extra that is included in this set is an excerpt of the book ""Clint Eastwood: Master Filmmaker at Work"". Unfortunately, it's just a 48-page sampler of the book (which is 240 pages in total). Why can't they just include the complete book?
If you are interested in purchasing the whole book (it's very nice), it is on sale:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clint-Eastwood-Master-Filmmaker-at-Work/dp/1419703889/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clint Eastwood: Master Filmmaker at Work</a>

*****

SUMMARY: I'm not sure if yet another Eastwood box set was necessary (it seems they're putting a new one out every year). This particular box set does have a lot of Eastwood's best work, but sadly it's also missing a few of the key movies from his career. Also, the packaging seems to be very nice for collectors, but unfortunately it puts the quality of the discs themselves at risk. For these reasons, I'd recommend you skip this particular product.

However, you can buy all of Eastwood's films individually - or there are many other box sets on blu-ray that you might consider purchasing instead of this one:

I think Million Dollar Baby has lossy sound as well does Space Cowboys if I remember correctly. The rest are all decent to good transfers of old blurays with lossless sound. They all obviously look much better than their DVD counterparts. I don't think any of them are really stunning or top tier though.

For 20 films the 56 dollar pricepoint is perfect. I didn't want all of these films, but for what is there I did want more than a couple. A Perfect World for one is a stunning film not available elsewhere as are the westerns included here. You also get some Dirty Harry, a comedy or two, and most of Eastwood's main output for Warner in the past 10 years. I guess it comes down to how you like some of these films. I haven't even seen a couple of the new ones so I will get back here to write a little when I get around to watching the complete set.

The packaging for me is great. I don't mind slipping the discs in the booklet style presentation. Otherwise they have to offer ridiculous packaging to accommodate this many films. What is there works perfectly for me. I couldn't ask for much more than for Warner to stop releasing crappy blurays. I swear there is no other company that has released so many low bitrate films in its time on this format. Whether that is because the masters are bad or what I don't know. I also must say this set isn't worth more than 56 dollars because of the problems inherent in Warner's Bluray technical expertise. This is basically worth a 50 and nothing more. For 50 it is a good deal. Otherwise stay away.

Also, where are the other 20 that were included on DVD?",1389225600,8,1830,4.313953488372093
