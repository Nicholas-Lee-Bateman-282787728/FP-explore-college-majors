7002451,1,B00T73APGA,"Let me start this review off by saying that I love Scream Factory and own somewhere around 20 of their blu ray releases, not including MST3k dvd sets. I even loved their Empire Of The Ants / Jaws Of Satan double feature, which were both corny and a lot of fun. I picked up this expecting that it would be more of the same-- and in many ways, it was. Food Of The Gods is a goofy eco-horror movie about a group of six or seven disparate characters who find themselves trapped on an island surrounded by giant chickens, wasps, and rats, and then have to fight to stay alive.

But the reason I'm giving this one star has nothing to do with the writing, directing or acting (which are all exactly what you would want / expect in this sort of film). Like some other viewers, I was really bothered by how the actual rats were evidently treated in the film. No, they weren't shot with bb guns (or, at least, I don't think they were), but they DO appear to have been shot with paint from little air guns. Sometimes this hits the rats in the eyes and it actually looks pretty painful. Towards the end of the film several more rats drown. This appears to have been done by just holding them underwater by the rat's tails. Whether or not they were released just before drowning, I'm not sure, but it looks incredibly unpleasant for the animals, and I spent a good portion of the movie stopping and starting the film to go online and see whether or not animals were actually harmed in the making of the film (there's no code at the end certifying that they weren't, so take that for what it's worth).

I'm not a member of PETA or anything like that-- just a horror fan looking for something light and silly to watch on a Tuesday night. On these incredibly modest terms, this film has failed. If you can watch this stuff without being bothered, more power to you, but I can't and found it an incredibly depressing viewing experience. I've rarely been disappointed by Scream Factory in the past, but this entry really bums me out, and I'll be returning this blu ray to the store where I bought it.

If you're at all interested in animal welfare, I'd recommend that you steer clear of this one.",1464048000,3,2178,4.359605911330049

7002454,4,B00T73APGA,"Two decent but not great transfers of two 1970's 'nature gone wild' movies.

Food of the Gods is the better of the two. It has a lot more action and several large creatures, some of which look good and some which don't. The wasp props were pretty good but the director, Bert I Gordon, chose to use just shadows in some of the scenes (reminiscent of 'The Black Scorpion' from 1957, which ran out of money at the end and used only a shadow at the end). The chicken head was almost comical and they wisely chose to use it just briefly. The worms looked good and creepy but were only briefly used. The stars of the show, the rats, were excellently done. The props looked very life like and the sets which were used for the 'real' rats were decent, even if the rats didn't seem to be doing what the director wanted them to do (this can be excused, try training a group of rats to act!).

Complaints: Marjoe Gortner should never be allowed to lead....as his actions caused many of the deaths....why not just drive away...afterall, how many times did they run around in the jeep.
A small five foot tall fence holding back the Pacific ocean, really?....and then the water floods an area which is way up on a hill...really, they could have done a lot better than that for an ending.

The commentary track is not very informative as it appears that B. I. Gordon is either senile or just can't hear. He was in his 90's at the time this was done so obviously he can be excused. As of the time of this review, he is still alive. The interviewer seems as if he is constantly badgering Gordon for info as Gordon does not volunteer a whole lot. You get a lot of confused 'yes' and 'no' answers and it appears Gordon cannot even hear the questions. In all honesty I didn't listen to the whole thing so it might have gotten better. I gave up after the first fifteen minutes and fast forwarded to different parts to see if it was going to get better.

Overall, Food of the Gods was an entertaining movie and one of Bert I Gordon's better films.

The second feature, Frogs, is a decent movie...but it is hurt by it's lack of special effects. The Frogs don't actually do any damage whatsoever, its the snakes, spiders, various reptiles and insects, even a turtle that do the damage. BTW many of these creatures would not be found anywhere near the Florida location where this was shot. Most of the creatures looked far more disinterested than menacing. The Frogs seemed to be trying to get away more often than they were attacking.

The 'nature' message is clear but as usual in these types of movies, the characters are mostly clueless or act in an unbelievable way. Sam Elliot's character (an ecology magazine photographer) makes a huge leap in logic right away and assumes after a second accidental death that nature is on the attack. Ray Milland's character stubbornly insists on continuing his birthday party even after several people have died and the rest are scared out of their wits.

The movie has a decent plot but probably would have been better off leaving the 'death' scenes to our imagination rather than try to film them. Basically you had a bunch of people that just sat around and waited to be killed rather than make a realistic attempt to get away.

As a side note, it looks as if the final scene was originally meant to be the scene in the car with Sam Elliot and the kids driving away. The final scene involves Ray Milland's character and it looks as if the two scenes were probably reversed in the editing room.

Overall, this blu-ray DVD is a good value and is recommended.

Recommended for any sci-fi fans of pre CGI films and obviously fans of Mr. B.I.G. himself.",1456876800,,3668,4.469357249626308

7002463,4,B00T73APGA,"Two 70's era monster movies, focusing on environmental-revenge.  These were both staples on Saturday afternoon ""Sci-Fi / Horror Theater"" back in the early 80's. Good over-all transfers (1 disk only)",1439164800,,198,5.6
7002464,5,B00T73APGA,"I have watched both film's on this excellent Blu-Ray set, but I'll just give my opinion of FROGS, which I find better of the two movies (not that FOOD OF THE GODS is not without its charms): Thanks in part to the success of WILLARD (1971), American International Picture wanted their own ""nature gone amuck"" film and fast-tracked this film, which I consider the first real true 70's ""nature gone amuck"" film because it actually dealt with man's inhumanity to ""lower"" species, polluting their grounds until they just had nothing else to do but retaliate. This was a huge success for A.I.P. (who kind of misled audiences believing that the frogs were huge because one of them holds a human hand in its mouth) and I have to say that for a PG-Rated film, this one really pushes the boundaries (a few death scenes had to be trimmed in order to get a PG Rating, but those cuts were restored beginning with Warner Home Video's VHS release of the film and it was still Rated PG). The film opens with ecologist Pickett Smith (and impossibly young and pre-moustache and beard Sam Elliott; ROAD HOUSE - 1989), who is taking photos of garbage and other things (such as dead animals) littering a lake in Florida. He is on assignment to write about how human pollution affects the ecology, especially animals, reptiles and even insects. His canoe is tipped over by a drunk Clint Crockett (Adam Roarke; DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY - 1974) as he is piloting a speedboat with his sister Karen (Joan Van Ark; THE LAST DINOSAUR - 1977) on board. Pickett loses all his equipment when his canoe overturns, so, after he pulls Clint in the water (Clint knows he deserves it), he and Karen take Pickett to the island owned by Clint & Karen's perpetually drunk wheelchair-bound father Jason Crockett (Ray Milland; an Academy Award-winning actor who, at this stage in his career, was starring in B-Films like THE THING WITH TWO HEADS [1972] and TERROR IN THE WAX MUSEUM [1973] ), who bosses everyone around like any patriarch would. It is July and three of the Crocketts are having birthdays (Including Jason, who was born of the Fourth of July), so the whole Crockett clan are at the secluded island mansion, including Clint's also hard-drinking wife Jenny (Lynn Borden; BLACK MAMA WHITE MAMA - 1973), grandkids Jay (Hal Hodges) and Tina (Dale Willingham), cousins Michael (David Gillam; THE FIFTH MISSILE - 1986), Iris (Holly Irving; TWO-MINUTE WARNING - 1976), Stuart (George Skaff; THE MANHANDLERS - 1973), and Kenneth Martindale (Nicolas Cortland; BONNIE'S KIDS - 1972), who brings along black girlfriend Bella (Judy Pace; THE SLAMS - 1973) with him (something Jason is not too pleased with, to put it politely), as well as black maid Maybelle (Mae Mercer; THE BEGUILED - 1971) and butler Charles (Lance Taylor, Sr.; BLACULA - 1972) who have served Jason for years. When the perpetually drunk Jason finds out that Pickett is an ecologist, he hires him to find out why so many frogs (of every type) are swarming on his island (some of the bullfrogs are as large as a cat) and also to see if he can find one of his employees who was searching for the downed wire of the telephone service, since the phones aren't working in the mansion right now. It's not very long before Pickett discovers that there is more than a frog problem on this island. as he finds the dead body of Jason's employee, with swarms of snakes of every type crawling all over his body (which is unheard of in nature). Pickett flips the body of the employee, where we get a good look at his snake-bitten swollen face, one of the first instances of where this would never pass for a PG Rating today. Pickett decides to keep the man's death a secret between just him and Jason, because he does not want to panic anyone, but it is apparent that the reptiles and insects want to take over the island. Pickett believes Mother Nature is in a state of revolt because of the way we are abusing her, as the big-a**ed frogs jump at the windows and deadly snakes hang from a chandelier (Jason just pulls out his pistol and nonchalantly shoots it!). Even tough most of the family wants to leave to island, Jason demands that they stay, because tomorrow is his birthday and ""We are the ugly rich!"". A romance begins brewing between Karen and Pickett as they celebrate Jason's birthday, but Jay and Tina think it will be funny to scare some frogs by throwing firecrackers at them (They will soon learn that it is not funny at all). Since the phone still isn't working, Stuart takes the Jeep and follows the phone line down the road until he can find the break in the line. while Pickett does some exploring of the island of his own (where he discovers many instances of nature out of balance). Stuart steps out of the Jeep to shoot a pheasant he sees in the air and when he goes to recover the body, he trips and shoots himself in his knee with the shotgun. While he is on the ground writhing in pain, hundreds of spiders spin a web around him like a cocoon until he is unable to move. He is then bitten to death by the spiders (good macro-photography of a real spider's mouth as it is about to bite) and is then covered completely by webs so no one can find him (I'm sure he'll make a good meal for all these spiders). Kenneth is the next to die when he is in the greenhouse and lizards of every kind (including Gila monsters) knock some poison off a shelf and Kenneth dies of asphyxiation due to the poisonous gas that quickly fills up the greenhouse. As Bella and Pickett discover his body, the frog population starts to grow enormously, so it is apparent that the deaths will be coming a lot quicker. Iris is killed while butterfly hunting while she is soused. She is nearly attacked by snakes, but she manages to get away, only to land in a bog and be covered with leeches (as she is pulling the bloody buggers off her face, we are again reminded how this would never pass with a PG Rating today). She is then bitten by a rattlesnake and dies, while the frogs watch. (It was originally filmed that she dies in a pool of quicksand while chasing butterflies, but it was deemed too ridiculous for the movie, but you can still see that death in the film's theatrical trailer, which is included on the Blu-Ray). Michael searches for Iris, only to be killed and eaten by a bunch of alligators, as the frogs gleefully watch and croak away (The stunt man substituting for Michael wrestles a real alligator). We then see his bloody body being dragged away by an alligator, another scene you would never see in a PG film today. Karen, once again, wants to leave the island, but Jason will not let anything or anybody ruin his special day. Pickett wants everyone off the island, but Jason once asserts his authority again, only allowing Bella, Maybelle and Charles to leave (he fires both Maybelle and Charles, even though they have given the better portions their lives serving him), instructing Clint to return the speedboat once he drops them off at the dock on the other end of the lake. When they arrive at the dock, they find it strangely empty and full of frogs, as Bella, Maybelle and Charles are attacked by birds, their fates still unknown. Clint is at the dock when he notices the speedboat's mooring rope has been chewed through and the boat is several hundred yards out in the lake. He jumps in the lake to swim to the boat, but he doesn't make it, as first something bites him under the water and then a deadly cottonmouth snake bites him just as he is about to get into the boat, killing him. Jenny sees all this happen while she is watching through binoculars at the lake's edge, but her feet get stuck in the mud and she is killed by a large snapping turtle. Pickett, Karen and the kids escape by using the canoe, but it becomes snagged on something, forcing Pickett to get out of the canoe and free whatever it is stuck on. Several cottonmouths try to bite him, but he fights them off and frees the canoe and they make it to the other dock (he fires a shotgun and kills an alligator following them). They notice how extremely quiet it is (Pickett discovers Bella's suitcase destroyed and knows that she, Maybelle and Charles are dead). A stubborn Jason stays alone in his mansion, as the frogs break the windows and invade the mansion (He even thinks the phone is ringing, but there is nothing but croaking on the other end of the line. Man, these are smart frogs!). He falls out of his wheelchair, as the frogs cover his body and finally kill someone: the person whose company is one of the worst polluters in Florida, namely Jason. Pickett, Karen and the kids get picked up by a mother and her young son in a station wagon. The woman makes a comment that they are the first people they have seen for over three hours, as her son shows Jay and Tina what he has caught while at camp: a giant bullfrog. Yes, Mother Nature has attacked the entire planet and now humans are the disposable species, which just proves one thing: Don't screw with Mother Nature, because she will always win. At the end of the final credits, we are shown a cartoon frog swallowing a human hand in one of the first post-credit sequences that I can recall in films. Like I said in the beginning of this review, I consider this the first ""nature gone amuck"" films of the 70's and after this became a hit for American International (thanks to a great advertising campaign, with the tag line ""Today -  the pond! Tomorrow - the world!""), there were a bunch of other films in the same genre released, such as STANLEY (1972); FANGS (1974); RATTLERS (1975; DAY OF THE ANIMALS (1976),  SQUIRM (1976), THE PACK (1977), NIGHTWING (1979) and even TV Movies, including TARANTULAS: THE DEADLY CARGO (1976); THE BEASTS ARE ON THE STREETS (1978) and MANEATERS ARE LOOSE (1978; I'm purposely keeping giant animal and killer bee films out of this because I consider them completely different genres). There were literally dozens of these films made in the 70's (I've barely scratched the surface in my choice of titles) and in nearly all the cases, it was man who turned these species against us. The 70's was an ecology-minded decade (where the 80's was all about ""Me! Me! Me!"") and then we became more concerned with terrorists with politicians turning their backs on the ecology (and global warming) and instilling a different fear into the population: The fear that your next door neighbor could be a terrorist. This is why the films made in the 70's had much more meat to them and were meaningful, if a little myopic (They were very serious issues back then, but playing armchair quarterback today, nothing much became of them). Director George McCowan (who passed away in 1995) was mainly known as a TV director, directing episodes of plenty of TV series while occasionally turning out a TV Movie (the under-appreciated THE LOVE WAR - 1970; and THE RETURN OF THE MOD SQUAD - 1989) and stepping out theatrically to make films like SHADOW OF THE HAWK (1976) and THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME (1979; The less said about this film, the better). The screenplay, by Robert Hutchinson and Robert Blees (WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO - 1971; SAVAGE HARVEST - 1981; another ""nature run amuck"" film, this time about lions) is really nothing but a string of animal and insect attacks connected together by the thinnest of plots (Mainly, Ray Milland acting like a bully), but it is a well-made film that doesn't overstay its welcome. Originally released on VHS by Warner Home Video  and then on DVD by MGM's ""Midnight Movies"" line. It is now available on a gorgeous double-feature Blu-Ray (with Bert I. Gordon's FOOD OF THE GODS - 1976) from Scream Factory. The anamorphic widescreen print is flawless and you can see that actual live reptiles and insects were used in the making of this. No cheap CGI or anamatronic puppets. If you like horror films from the 70's (don't worry about the PG Rating because, back in the 70's, the rating was more adult in nature and they got away with a lot more than PG films today, especially in the violence department), by all means buy this wonderful record of the 70's. A Scream Factory Blu-Ray Release. Rated PG.",1438041600,,12134,4.570247933884297
7002465,5,B00T73APGA,"During the 1970s there were themed movies of ""nature's gone mad"" and this set is a definite contribution. I used to have the VHS on these and remember them well for what they are. It's a message to mankind not to screw up nature, but to take care of the Earth that we live in and that includes all creatures. There was no CGI back then and I think ""FOTG"" did a fantastic job. The rainy night scene where Mr. Skinner gets a flat tire in rain and then sees giant rats approaching is a pretty intense scene. A liquid is seemingly bringing creatures to gigantic size and then they attack everything smaller than ""them"". There is a homage to ""The Birds"" toward the end of the movie.
Pamela Franklin (The Legend of Hell House, The Nanny), Marjoe Gortner (StarCrash, Earthquake), Belinda Belaski (The Howling) star..

""Frogs"" is on course on being one of those '70s movies that you just can't stop from loving the cheesiness of it all. A crotchety Millionaire (Ray Milland) invites his family over to his island estate for the annual 4th of July birthday, but the animal kingdom of the island don't like their tenant poisoning and killing their fellow creatures, so they have had enough! They disrupt the family at every chance they get and seek revenge until the entire clan is gone from the island they inhabit. The death to me that is the most laughable is that of one of the family men going out to check on the phone line. He gets out of his Jeep and somehow ends up shooting his leg and falls, injured at the knee or close to it. Wrong move dude! You just fell into the spiders nest. lol  The spiders then proceed to drop the moss hanging from the trees and spin there webbing all over him and the area. He soon becomes a human cocoon, buried by the spiders.
One of the other men taking the servants and a model girlfriend of Clint (asphyxiated in the Green House by poisonous gases), to the other side of the Lake on his boat finds that the rope has somehow been cut. His boat is now drifting away from the dock. While swimming to the boat, water snakes attack him. His wife seeing this from the Mansion with the binoculars runs down to try and do something about it. lol She ends up getting stuck in the mud and that's where an Alligator snapping Turtle takes his revenge. lol

All in all, a pretty good release from Scream Factory! Good transfers on both, good special features also, Widescreen.

7002471,5,B00T73APGA,Great double feature from Scream Factory! The HD transfers are very well done for two low budget features from the 70s.,1435104000,,119,4.714285714285714
7002472,3,B00T73APGA,"I have always been a huge fan of drive in movies. Perhaps thats because for most of my teen years the only place to see movies in my town was the drive in. But the whole culture of the drive in and the movies that were made to be shown there has been ingrained in my soul now, so much so that I love seeing them still. And while they may not have had huge budgets behind them the creativity and attempts to make great movies were more than enough.

Fans of these movies can rejoice because Shout/Scream Factory has done a great job of rediscovering classic movies like these that made their way to VHS years ago but have been screaming for a decent DVD release for some time now. The fact that they are releasing several as double feature blu-rays make them even more difficult to resists. One example of this is the double feature of THE FOOD OF THE GODS/FROGS. Both are part of a sub-genre of horror that dealt with animals gone wild attempting to take back the planet from ungrateful pollution filled man.

FOOD is loosely (very much so) based on a story by H.G. Wells. It features Marjoe Gortner as a professional football star on vacation at a remote island. While there, one of his friends goes off into the woods and is attacked by a 3 foot long wasp that looks, well, terrible. This is a no budget special effect but with movies like these it doesnt matter. He dies and Marjoe and another friend must take him back to town.

While looking for a phone to use to call the police, Marjoe comes across a house. When no one answers the door he looks in the chicken coop only to discover chickens that are 8 feet tall! The rooster attacks him (again a really cheesy looking rooster head prop) and he ends up killing the rooster. The owners have been taking a weird substance thats been coming from their spring and adding it to the feed the give the animals, making them grow to this substantial size.

As the film progresses more characters are added and the discovery that rats have found their way into the house and the feed being fed to the animals. This leads to a pack of giant rats using actual rats in long shots and huge rat heads in close up attacks. As I said most of these are cheesy but fun. With the exception of the amount of blood seen (not too much for gore hounds though) this movie might even be easy enough for a few youngsters to watch. Its all in fun and makes for one riotous drive in movie.

FROGS takes on a different tone, opting not for poorly made animal heads but instead using actual amphibians as Mother Natures source of might. Sam Elliot (yes THE Sam Elliot sans moustache) is a photographer taking pictures at a lake where pollution is a concern. When a speedboat tips his canoe, the driver (Adam Roarke) and his sister (Joan Van Ark pre-KNOTS LANDING days) pick him up and offer to take him to their house on a nearby island to dry off and recover. Once there he discovers they're part of a family most of us wouldnt want to be a part of.

Patriarch Ray Milland runs the family with an iron fist, forcing them to be there each year to celebrate the birthdays that fall in the same month for several of them. With each hoping to be included in his will, worth millions, they do any and everything he asks of them catering to his every need. Each one gets a chance to show why they do what they do or why they ignore him.

But something is amiss. Huge groups of frogs are showing up on the island, enough so their noise at night keeps some awake. One of the servants has gone missing and Milland asks Elliot to see if he can find him. He does so only to discover his body covered in snakes and bitten by them. He reports back but holds the information from the rest. While they don't pay attention we get to keep an eye on the fact that more and more animals are gathering on the island. A combination of snakes, lizards, frogs and spiders work together to take down several of the family members in various locations. As each one disappears the rest begin to realize that something is happening.

This clueless bunch is so money hungry that they don't seem to notice much of anything. For some it might be a weakness in the script but for the rest of us who cares? Its a drive in movie kids and no one pays attention to things like this! Its the same reason we don't pay attention to the over acting of some and the solid performances of others.

The movie has developed a cult following over the years with many seeking out and collecting the poster featuring the oversized frog dead center. It has been released on DVD but never blu-ray to my knowledge and fans will want to add this one to their collection. The fact that it comes as a double feature with a few extras will make it even more treasured by those collectors.

Neither picture is brain surgery but both are tremendous amounts of fun for fans of drive in and low budget films. The picture delivered is as clear and clean as you will get with the sources provided and make for a decent nights entertainment. Pop some corn, take a few cans of soda, set up your TV in the window and sit on the back porch under the stars and you can pretend you're back at the drive in with these two movies. Just remember, automobile back seats are not included.",1433894400,,5245,4.310344827586207

i cannot say the same for the Audio quality sorry, terrible Mono sound similar to the very old MGM DVD sound
Scream factory should've at least added a new 5.1 Mix or Master audio stereo mix
instead it's a terrible mono sound it's pretty bad it hurts to listen to the Audio when your watching the film
i mean what's the point giving an old classic film a new HD transfer when your not going to do the same for the sound quality
that's what Blu-ray technology is for to enhance the sound quality aswell as the picture quality aswell
i'm Definitely not impressed, very pathetic effort with the sound quality
there are new special features for F.O.T.G
a new interview with Actress Belinda Balaski
she gives her comments on the Food of the Gods and how she got involved in the film
aswell as talking about other films she's been in, she mentions the Howling & Gremlins
she gives opinions on the special effects in the film, the creature effects with the rats etc
she compares old fashioned effects to CGI effects
interesting interview, tragically only goes for 11mins thou
no other Actors from the film are interviewed they're probably all passed away (Died) by now

Director Bert Gordon is not interviewed either, However Bert does do a new commentary for the film
and sad to say it's pointless commentary, Bert doesn't seem interested to talk about the F.O.T.G
either he's not interested or he's got memory problems on making the film or both
from a fans point of view i am not impressed with this new commentary for this new blu-ray
what's the point of giving a commentary for the film if your really not interested talking about the film
Don't insult the fans.
the next film on this 1 Disc blu-ray is FROGS, about a plague of Frogs that became mutated and attack the people in the small town
FROGS was given the exact HD transfer treatment as The Food of the Gods in 1:78:1 widescreen ratio thou
also the same sound quality treatment aswell, terrible mono sound
so figure it out, the same 'HD transfer' as the Food of the Gods need i say more
there's only one extra for Frogs a new 10mins interview with Actress Joan van Ark
Frogs was Joans first film role, she gives lots of Great recollections on Frogs & working with Actor Sam elliott

look it's Great that these 2 old classics have been given some respect with new HD transfers from scream factory
but the sound quality is shocking for both films, i definitely expected more effort with the sound quality
instead SF did not bother for some reason
plus a new Bert Gordon interview would've been better i think, instead of his Audio commentary
4 stars for the film, maybe 3 stars meaning it's okay/average blu-ray version",1433203200,,3051,4.563868613138686
7002474,4,B00T73APGA,"Both movies are crisp and have excellent sound

Food of the Gods has a giant rooster, giant wasps, and mostly giant brown rats attacking people shot entirely on Bowen Island off BC Canada.  The film employs no CGI and the effects are all real time,  the giant rats are effective, especially in a flat tire car scene scenario.

Frogs is the more unusual of the two, where frogs are orchestrating a swamp rebellion were all creatures imaginable kill the Crockett clan on the 4th of July celebration.

Both are campy, but done seriously so that they are very effective but silly enough to enjoy on both levels.

Food of the Gods  has a director commentary and Frogs has an interview with Van Arc.  The sound is vey good and if you like B movie horror from the seventies this double feature is a must have.",1433030400,7,802,4.482758620689655
7002475,5,B00T73APGA,"I just received this today.  Have to LOVE Amazon for getting some Pre-Orders to a custumer early!  This is one of Shout! Factory's Double Feature Blu-Rays.  These two films, ""Food Of The Gods"" & ""Frogs"", were part of the 1970's ""Eco-Horror"" film craze.  Other Films included during this era""Squirm"", ""Ants"", ""Empire Of The Ants"", ""Kingdom Of The Spiders"", Night Of The Lepus"", ""Prophecy"", Et. Al.
  I bought this mostly for ""Frogs"", which is very CHEESY.  Of course those of you who have read my earlier reviews know I LOVE my cheese!  But I digress.  This double creature feature has Shout! Factory's excellent transfer to Blu-Ray.  And their Bonus features are excellent as well!
  Do yourself a favor.  Get some popcorn, put this double billing on, at treat yourself to some 1970's cheesy Eco-Horror!",1432512000,9,803,4.947368421052632
7002476,1,B00T73APGA,"These two give AIP/MGM a bad name. FotG's features blatant, graphic, bloody gore upon live rats. Yep folks, that's where the queasiness comes from watching this masterpiece. Worst actual carnage to live rats occurs at 64, 78 & 80 minutes in. They appear to be getting shot with a high-powered pellet rifle. If that's not enough, several clearly drown in the finale of this ""fictional film"". Nice.

""Frogs"", on the other hand, is simply straight-up boring. While no live creatures appear to be harmed in this one, there's just very little to get excited about either. Long, drawn out scenes of ""malevolent nature"" that fail to deliver much memorable imagery is the rule here. A dull slog, which leads me to ask...",1425081600,10,712,4.836065573770492

8700696,5,B00T73APGA,"Scream Factory delivers one of their best blu-ray double features to date by pairing up a couple of classic American International Pictures releases in the form of 1976's ""The Food of the Gods"" and 1972's ""Frogs"". While neither could be considered a good movie by the textbook definition, they are a great deal of fun which never take themselves too seriously and represent two of the best entries in seventies era eco-themed horror. Both had been available on DVD before but this represents each film's high definition debut.

""The Food of the Gods"" is presented in 1.85:1 wide-screen while ""Frogs"" is featured in 1.78:1 with both films sharing a dual layer blu-ray. I owned each film previously on DVD and this blu-ray represents a noticeable improvement in visual quality for each film. Detail and colors look great with each film retaining a nice filmic grain structure. Scream Factory used the existing hi-def master for ""The Food of the Gods"" provided by MGM but the transfer does not look dated at all. ""Frogs"" on the other hand got a brand new HD transfer just for this release. Print damage is seen here and there with one very noticeable rip in the negative visible at the 19:10 mark of ""Frogs"" but overall the transfers are pretty clean overall. No compression artifacts are to be seen. Contrast and black levels are nicely rendered. Without each film getting full blown restorations at some point this is the best each will ever look which is surprisingly great. Audio is in 2 channel lossless sound for each film.

Scream Factory also saw fit to put a few nice extras on the disc as follows:
""THE FOOD OF THE GODS""
New Audio Commentary With Director Bert I. Gordon
New Interview With Actress Belinda Balaski
Radio Spot
Photo Gallery
Theatrical Trailer

""FROGS""
New Interview With Actress Joan Van Ark
