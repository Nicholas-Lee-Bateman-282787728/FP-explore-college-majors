3655062,5,B001JAHRGU,"Well this is some BS!!!! I love this show just like so many people do,they put out more dumb ass shows on dvd but when it comes to a show like this we get ripped off. THE REST OF THE SEASONS NEED TO BE RELEASED PLEASE!!!! This show has a way to suck you in episode by episode and I love it.",1334534400,6,290,3.693548387096774
3655063,5,B001JAHRGU,"I have been waiting and waiting for the remaining seasons to be released.  I'm glad that Season 4 was finally made available.  Now, how about the remaining two seasons?  I would love to have the entire series, as it was one of my favorite shows of all time!",1333324800,7,257,4.3125
3655064,5,B001JAHRGU,"I pretty much find the fact that the rest of the seasons still remain unreleased totally unacceptable.  In this day and age where everything is being released on DVD, there is no excuse not to release the remaining PO5 DVD seasons.  The show was a hit, commercially and critically, and gave rise to many TV stars who are still going quite strong in the entertainment industry today.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release the remaining PO5 DVD seasons!  We want them!!!",1314835200,19,460,4.784810126582278
3655065,5,B001JAHRGU,It's been insanely too long......come on. Give us the rest of the series. Season 4 is a great season.....challenging the family and gave me inspiration during that time in my lifel,1302652800,7,180,4.838709677419355
3655066,5,B001JAHRGU,I am so bummed. I bought the first 3 seasons of po5 and got so hooked being able to watch the show again and now I just want to continue on and can't because they won't release season 4 and 5! I don't get what the hold up is. I have been waiting way too long! Has anyone heard anything about when they are releasing it?!,1293321600,5,320,3.8636363636363638
3655067,5,B001JAHRGU,"I want the whole series of Pof5! I loved Dawson's Creek and One Tree Hill, but Pof5 was my all time favorite series. It's timeless and nothing compares to it then or now! It teaches so many life lessons, and underneath the happiness, anger, laughter, pain, jubilation, frustration, joy and heartache this family experiences together, is an all encompassing and unconditional love for one another. I really feel sorry for people who recently stumbled upon the series and became hooked. They should be able to have access to all of the seasons. For now, I'll keep my many VHS tapes from Season Four and on.",1292457600,11,604,4.761904761904762
3655068,5,B001JAHRGU,"Why do we rush and release so many violent tv series, and yet when it comes to good hearted, good feeling and lesson learning series like Party of Five---that are feel good shows in every way, it seems to take for forever if ever to make them available?

The world has enough real violence in it, why not give the population a chance to enjoy real, but non violent moments offered by this series?",1288051200,28,396,4.351351351351352

3655070,5,B001JAHRGU,"Seriously...when will the fourth season be released?  I don't understand how they can release only parts of seasons, and leave fans (who've already shelled out money) hanging.

3655182,5,B001JAHRGU,"I find myself rewatching popular dramas from the 90's not just out of nostalgia but for the fact that they have a moral lesson at the end of the day.

3655235,5,B001JAHRGU,I missed the series when it first came out. The story arc of Charlie's cancer and the family's response was realistic and poignant. The weaving in of subplots was creative. Season 4 was thought-provoking.,1378339200,,204,5.029411764705882
3655236,5,B001JAHRGU,"Loved the part where the brothers take on the responsiblity of the family, the hardships it presented and the willingness to sacrific to do it.  The changing of the triangle of love life for each one and how it affected them, was necessary to keep the story going, but sometime it felt not real.",1378252800,,295,4.462962962962963

3655239,5,B001JAHRGU,Loved watching all the episodes of Party of Five.  Would love to see a reunion.  Those were good actors.  I suggest spending a rainy day watching the Salingers..,1377734400,,161,4.678571428571429
3655240,5,B001JAHRGU,"Welcome back Salingers.  Get caught up with a great family drama. Relive the Julia/Griffin Storyline.  The coming home of Kristin.  A grown up Owen, Bailey/Saras blossoming love.  great quality, great product.",1377561600,,209,5.645161290322581

3655272,5,B001JAHRGU,They don't make shows like this anymore. Great drama but not trashy or violent. I cry at almost every episode.,1375228800,,110,4.55
3655273,5,B001JAHRGU,Great price for a great show! I really liked that I was able to watch this show immediately without waiting!,1374710400,,108,4.45
3655274,5,B001JAHRGU,"This review is for the DVD set of Party of Five, Season 4.

The picture quality is superb, as is the sound. The DVDs themselves (i.e., the artwork ON the discs) look great, as does the artwork on the outside of the clam shell case; a classy job inside and out for made-on-demand discs.

True, no subtitles exist for the hearing-impaired, but this is a bare bones offering (once we're talking of made-on-demand DVDs)--and it really is professional and excellent in all respects, but for the lack of subtitles and extras.

A+. Recommend.

P.S. - The plots do seem thinner as the years go by, yes even with Charlie getting cancer in season 4, which just seems like they're reaching for everything that they threw up against the proverbial wall.  But, the actors and actresses are still attractive and likable, and the stories believable, if slightly less so; the 45 minutes for each episode really flies by, and I watch at least two episodes at a time.",1374278400,,949,4.658682634730539
3655275,5,B001JAHRGU,"Why oh why are we addicted to this???

Probably because these are countless major dramas in EACH episode......how can the writers possibly continue to come up with more????

We (my daughter and I) love it.  Maybe we love to hate it or hate to love it.....but whatever.  :)",1374019200,,272,4.604166666666667
3655276,5,B001JAHRGU,"It's not a crappy show. During the doldrums of winter and spilling into spring and summer this year, my wife rediscovered this charming yet depressing 90s drama. What can I say: I'm glad we have more than one room in our house. ""Everybody wants to be...free.""",1373760000,,259,4.6521739130434785
3655277,4,B001JAHRGU,"Words cannot express how happy I am about this release! I ordered mine immediately and have spent the last few months researching the first three seasons. All that time since 2008 made me forget how much I loved this show.

I am glad Sony has a Manufacture on Demand program! The video quality is just as good as retail discs. If you bought through a third party and received a bootleg, this is not the same set Amazon is offering. Amazon has an arrangement with Sony to sell Nona ride Manufacture on Demand products. Your set will come sealed in plastic with genuine DVDs.

My only complaint is the nature of MOD. Because the discs are beyond bare bones here. Each successive release has been more lacking than the last. I assume the MOD process always eliminates special features, but it would have been nice to include menu graphics from the show on these discs. Instead they have generic menus that look like something off a basic DVD authoring program.

But that is my only complaint. We already see the pre-order for season 5, and I can only hope we get the 6th and final season by the end of the year.

If you want the rest of this season on DVD, buy through Amazon. You won't be disappointed...well I mean you'll at least have them on DVD, right? And almost eight years from the season 1 release is better than never getting them!",1371600000,4,1338,4.471311475409836
3655278,5,B001JAHRGU,I have been re-watching Party of Five. I am surprised how much I still like it and how it travels well into the 21 century.  I am completely entertained with the cast and the writing. The casting director amazingly selected a cast that are believable as siblings. Although the concept of them all living together and being permitted to do so is a tiny bit far fetched the entertainment value is still wonderful.,1371081600,,411,4.63013698630137
3655279,4,B001JAHRGU,"I am pleased that they have put out season 4 and hope they put out the rest as I want all the seasons. I wish however that they had put a booklet of the episodes out, which is nice to have when you want to look for a certain episode. All it comes with are the DVD's. Regardless though I am happy they finally put the 4th season out -though it does feel that their heart wasn't in it, but it's easy to still charge a high price for it.",1370217600,2,434,3.8333333333333335
3655280,5,B001JAHRGU,"This series keeps getting more incredible. The actors have matured beautifully into their roles & I am blown away by the depth of their portrayals. Love, love, love this show.",1370044800,,175,4.866666666666666
3655321,1,B001JAHRGU,"turned out to be bootleg copy. The menu wasn't even a party of five ,just a graphic of TV sets. the packaging was wrapped up so you couldn't open it without breaking the plastic paper holder. It wasn't even able to play it on my computer and the Blu-ray player had a stretched out version of the episodes. I was very disappointed and i'm not sure if my money was returned

3655330,5,B001JAHRGU,"Sometimes when you watch films or tv series from your youth or childhood as a grown-up, you're really disappointed and ask yourself how you could ever like something like this. This never happens when I watch ""Party of Five"". I was so relieved when I found out that season 4 would finally be released. I ordered it from Germany paying quite a lot of money for shipping and I've just finished watching the whole season. So now it's waiting again ... for season 5 ... please don't let it be years again. This is one of the best and most touching tv series I've ever seen. I'm just glad that I can at least watch it in English because here in Germany we have given up hope of ever having the remaining DVDs released.",1364515200,,713,4.3283582089552235

I'm happy that they have finally released the next season on DVD but am angry that I cannot enjoy them especially in this day and age when 95% of DVDs released have at least CC or subtitles.
