tape for many years then this DVD, after much demand finally came out. Tragic in  way because of Jackie's early MS which killed her much too young. You will watch this over and over",1500681600,,326,4.174603174603175

8505334,5,B006W3HGIS,"The name of Christopher Nupen appended to any film project associated with music is assurance that one is in for a memorable journey. This release devoted to Schubert clearly illustrates that proposition. Its comprised of 2 films made by Mr. Nupen. The first, Trout, was shot in 1966. The Greatest Love and The Greatest Sorrow took nearly 10 years to complete and followed later. They naturally complement each other. Trout mirrors the young composer at his happiest and most hopeful stage of development, not unlike the 5 musicians who are the focus of Mr. Nupens narrative. They are observed at work and play, personifying the joyous, life affirming tone which dominates this famous work. In its day, this informal style of presenting classical music was unheard of and actually discouraged by reputable critics who predicted failure. Nevertheless, Mr. Nupens gamble paid off with the Trout gaining enormous success and enduring favor among audiences. Alluding to a vivid dream Schubert recounted, The Greatest Love and The Greatest Sorrow deals with the last 20 months of the composers life not so much in specific events but more as a glimpse into Schuberts complex psyche, his hopes, fears and travails. This is accomplished by revealing personal letters, period art and, of course, the music itself, most especially the Lieder. The result is uniquely moving. Mr. Nupen has assembled and arranged his materials in a masterful fashion. Composition, lighting, editing, pacing and narration are proof of a highly creative intellect at work. One comes away with a heightened appreciation and, dare say, compassion for this sensitive genius. The concluding survey of other releases produced by Mr. Nupen certainly whets ones appetite.",1463097600,6,1734,5.263537906137184
8505335,5,B006W3HGIS,"The art of the classical music documentary film is alive and well. I've given very positive reviews to recent films by Marco Capalbo and Eric Schulz. One of the best documentarians of them all, Christopher Nupen, is still going strong; his Daniil Trifonov films were released last year to great acclaim on DVD.

It's nice to know a bit about how Nupen got where he is now, though. Luckily Allegro Films is releasing his full catalogue on DVD. In this recent release from Allegro's series The Christopher Nupen Films we have an early masterpiece, The Trout, and the 1994 Schubert documentary The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow.

The Trout is a very special hour of film that represents the happy accident of five young musical superstars-to-be coming together in London, with a young director who, as Pauline Kael said about Robert Altman, ""had poetry in him."" Nupen had an ace up his sleeve: new silent 16mm cameras that allowed a much more informal (indeed, Altmanesque) filming style. But it's the poetry that seals the deal, not the technology.

The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow isn't as innovative as The Trout. Indeed, it's a standard Ken Burns-style documentary, with voice-over and period paintings and drawings. Two things make it special. The first is the stature of the performances, which are astonishing. I was especially impressed with the fierce quality of Andreas Schmidt in the songs, and the piano artistry of Vladimir Ashkenazy, who provides sensitive accompaniment and an individual way with solo piano works. The second is something that's fairly rare in classical music documentaries, but which drives the whole film. Nupen has a thesis for his film, which he argues forcefully and effectively, against the idea that Schubert died before he reached his full destiny as a composer, and is thus not at the same level as the great masters. A certain level of advocacy is perhaps assumed in classical music documentaries; after all, why make a film at all if the subject hasn't some intrinsic worth. But Nupen's aim is to elevate Schubert to the level of Beethoven, which he emphasizes by beginning the film with Beethoven's funeral (where Schubert was a torch-bearer), and following with the music, letters and stories of the next 20 months that Schubert had to live. I was completely on board with this concept; I've always felt Schubert is, along with Beethoven, the greatest composer for the piano, and is all by himself as the greatest composer of art songs. So it works for me, and if, as they say, your mileage may vary, at least Nupen has provided a cogent argument.",1462060800,,2607,4.920454545454546
8505336,5,B006W3HGIS,"The South African born filmmaker Christopher Nupen is known for his made for television documentaries of classical music and classical musicians. His two films about Franz Schubert (1797 -- 1828), ""The Trout"" and ""The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow"" are among the best and most popular documentaries on classical music. The films have recently been reissued on a single DVD by Nupen's company, Allegro Films, under the heading ""The Films of Christopher Nupen"". The DVD is distributed by Naxos and Naxos has kindly sent me a copy for review.  There are some fine and highly informative reviews of this DVD here on Amazon under an earlier release.

The first film, ""The Trout"" celebrates Schubert and five young musicians and friends who were then in their youth and about to achieve fame. In August 1969, Daniel Barenboim directed the opening of the new Queen Elizabeth Hall in London by arranging a series of concerts.  On August 30, Barenboim and four young gifted friends, Itzhak Perlman, violin, Pinchas Zukerman, on the viola, Jacqueline du Pre, cello, and Zubin Mehta, double bass presented what has become a legendary performance captured on this DVD. The artists were gifted and in their 20's and on the cusp of fame.  The film offers a glimpse of each performer during their stay in London, in rehearsals, and in the performance of ""The Trout"" quintet. The music is exuberant, accessible and fun in the manner of the 22-year old Schubert. So too were the performers at this stage of their lives.  The DVD takes the viewers backstage and shows five friends in the joy of life having unabashed fun, ribbing one another, laughing and joking during their music making. Viewers will be reminded that music should be above all fun.  The film became the most frequently watched classical music documentary in history.  Watching it today, in 2016, evokes a feeling of nostalgia that wouldn't have been apparent when the film was released.  I invariably thought of how people, myself included, have grown older and more serious and somber since the heady moments captured on this film. The film also gave the opportunity to reflect on the sadly interrupted and all too brief career of the lovely and gifted Jacqueline du Pre.  This is a justly famous film with a wonderful performance of ""The Trout"" and a look at joyous, spirited, youthful musicians.

The second film, ""The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow"" focuses on the last twenty months of Schubert's short life. Knowing that he was terminally ill, Schubert worked in his final year to produce an extraordinary body of music. This documentary shows the nature of Schubert's efforts with beautifully performed selections from the masterworks of his final years in the form of masses, piano sonatas, songs, and chamber music. Andreas Schmidt beautifully sings several songs, and an unforgettable recording of Lotte Lehman singing Schubert's song ""Im Arbendrot"" closes the film. The film also makes use of Schubert's own words in the form of letters to his friends and family to cast light on Schubert's approach to music and to life. These sources are generally only known to specialists and they help make this film effective. Paintings and scenes drawn from the Vienna of the late 1820s help enhance the appeal and feel of the documentary.  Nupen wanted to make a case for the maturity of Schubert's late work and of the composer's right to a place in the first rank.  He does so convincingly and beautifully. First shown in 1994, ""The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow""  introduces Schubert's poignant and beautiful late music to a broad audience.

In brief introductions to each film, Nupen discusses the hopes he had held in his early career for television as a medium which could expand people's cultural horizons -- a role he now believes may be filled by the DVD.  These two DVDs offer an outstanding way to get to know Schubert and some of the gifted musicians who have performed his works. The films will reward watching both by viewers new to Schubert and by those who love and how have had long experience with his music.
