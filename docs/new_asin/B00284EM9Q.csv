3871850,3,B00284EM9Q,"Very disappointed.  If this is your first train video you might feel different, but virtually everything included in this dvd has been previously available on other dvds.  Both videos and dialogue is just repackaged for previously existing materials.  In my case I wasted my money.  Again, if you don't already have a large number of this type video you might feel entirely different.",1404086400,4,384,5.0476190476190474

8355783,2,B00284EM9Q,"I was really excited when this finally arrived as I had been watching the price to drop and when it did, I snatched it up thinking I had an awesome addition to my collection.  I wish Amazon would allow for 1/2 stars, because it does deserve 2 1/2 stars.  Unfortunately, this is as jumpy and jittery as a used VHS tape and I am watching it on my Blu-ray player!  Many scenes are blurry.  Apparently, all they did with this was transfer to DVD, no remastering, no form of clean-up whatsoever.  I like to see the numbers and roadnames on the locos and most DVD's I have, it is visible.  But due to the fuzziness, most text is unreadable.  So disappointed, but since it is about steam trains, I gave it 2 (1/2, but again, Amazon doesn't allow for 1/2 stars.

In short, the transfer was buggy, looks like they used a worn in VHS tape as the master.  No clean-up was done, so the imperfections, e.g., video noise, spots and blemishes from the master remain.  Some scenes are really out of focus.  Then, there's the jitter and bouncing.  Some shots are similar to streaming lags, causing the movement to be almost stop-motion.  I did not expect Blu-ray quality, but at least cleaning up the noise and imperfections before copy would have been appreciated.",1438905600,2,1248,4.517857142857143

8355785,5,B00284EM9Q,"This is a wonderful collection of film footage of steam locomotives. They are NOT promotional or commercial videos done by railroads. They appear to be professionally or semi professionally done, however. The railroads are generally in the northeast plus bonus footage of the Amtrak California Zephyr that is quite interesting that is professionally done but not promotional in nature. It is about 55 minutes long and includes numerous ""outtakes"" of anecdotal material. Very enjoyable. There's also footage of the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific steam engines. There's also a bonus feature of the Cass, Shea and Heisler logging locomotives that will whet anyone's appetite for viewing those locos. This is a wonderful addition to any railroad video collector's library. It's footage I've never seen anywhere else and I have over 150 railroad videos - VCR and DVD. You'll not be disappointed.",1430956800,,898,5.375886524822695
8355786,4,B00284EM9Q,Some repeated videos from other railfan videos. Still a very good compendium of steam...the last years.,1424563200,,103,5.5
