8656194,5,B00K62YRME,The science fiction thriller is really interesting. Nick's character was awesomw where he dies and has memory flashback about the suicide of his fiancee. The story of afterlife of him searching the reason behind the suicide was the best part I enjoyed. Thumbs up to Shawn Holmes and the entire team for this almost no budget film!,1518048000,,330,4.807017543859649

8656197,3,B00K62YRME,"Memory Lane is notable more for the fact that is was made on such a minuscule budget than for its content, probably the lowest-budgeted science fiction film ever made. Director Shawn Holmes is reminiscent of 1950s director Ed Wood, who made feature films on shoestring budgets. The big difference is that Holmes film is pretty good.

After his return from Afghanistan, soldier Nick Boxer falls in love with Kayla, whose suicide he prevented perhaps. When he finds her body in the bathtub with her wrists slashed, Nick undertakes his own suicide but is rescued by friends. After being revived, he determines to figure out the circumstances of Kaylas suicide, but it involves more near-death experiences. Without the money for special effects, Holmes focuses on a tight script with unforeseen twists, in-depth characterization, and excellent cinematography and editing.

Bonus features on the DVD release include directors commentary, deleted scenes, short films, and screen tests.",1427241600,2,979,5.392156862745098
8656198,2,B00K62YRME,"Nick Boxer (Michael Guy) comes home from Afghanistan and takes a radio into a bathtub. He dies and has a memory flashback, being with Kayla (Meg Barrick) his dead fiancee. This does not bode well with his wife and friends. His friends indulge Nick as he wants to play ""Flatliners"" at home in a bathtub, but after a few times, they are reluctant to do it. Nick believes he can save her.

The film is short. The acting was mediocre, with Nick being outright bad. The dialogue had no zip and the characters were cardboard. The film stretches to 70 minutes with the credits.

Parental Guide: Brief sex scene. No visible nudity.",1408838400,2,623,4.553571428571429
