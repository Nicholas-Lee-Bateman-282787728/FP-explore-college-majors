6397322,5,B00JZTIBW6,"Love this movie! A very entertaining movie about 2 inseparable friends bonded together since they were kids due to circumstances by the partition of Bangladesh from India back in the 70's that inadvertently landed them in Calcutta with little hope or options until they found the means to support themselves by hook or by crook! Fast forward a decade so later and... ta... da! we have 2 adults in the gorgeous form of Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor - the ultimate outlaws, loved by the people they helped but hated by law enforcers as well as rival gangsters. They were magnificent together but it was Ranveer Singh that shone with his swagger, charisma and intense presence that almost overwhelmed the rest of the cast and they were no slouch themselves. Highly recommended!
 Note: Ranveer Singh has the makings of a super-duper mega star that could surpass all the Khans and Kapoors of the Bollywood film industry. Watch this movie as well as Ram-Leela and you'll know what I'm talking about!",1401840000,5,994,4.847058823529411

8654703,5,B00JZTIBW6,This movie is great and they both have amazing chemistry. I don't know why this movie is getting a bad rep. its hilarious. Guarantee you if this had sharukh and salman the same haters would be riding the five stars.,1494028800,,215,4.4
8654704,2,B00JZTIBW6,"I wanted this to be more fun then it ever was. I enjoy fun masala films but this can't quite be classed as such because it was apparently also trying to make some kind of point of the struggles of refugees-which are valid points but they are rendered meaningless in this kind of movie. I like Ranveer okay- he always seems to give off that leering greasy vibe of that guy at the bar that you know will give you a venereal disease but you're still kind of attracted to anyway- but he's wooden and clearly doesn't seem to be having much fun being an ""outlaw"". Why Priyanka's character falls in love with him is a real mystery. The only one with any swagger was Irrfan who was at least one good thing about the film and he's why I gave this 2 stars instead of one.
 I guess this movie was also trying get across the importance friendship but really the overall message seemed to be don't bother trying to rise above your difficult past. Feel free to skip this.",1493683200,,957,4.287292817679558

8654706,5,B00JZTIBW6,"Good Action, Crime and Drama Movie! Loved Arjun Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra are my two favorites.
Two childhood friends travel from Bangladesh to Calcutta during the tempestuous 1907s, becoming criminal superstars who both fell in love for a dancer.
Loved it, good movie",1425340800,,269,5.27906976744186
8654707,4,B00JZTIBW6,Enjoy the camaraderie of the stars from childhood to adulthood. Just a little criminal activity now and then. Priyanka Chopra is almost evil in this movie. Almost.,1424736000,,163,5.074074074074074
