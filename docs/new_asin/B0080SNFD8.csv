I have watched this interview 3 times and  bought the dvd as a Christmas present for my Christian friend. She loved the interview also. What you will be amazed by as  Corrie tells her story, is that you KNOW she has met Jesus Christ! You just have to see for yourself! I would also reccomend the movie about Corrie and her family's care of jewish people during WWII in ""The Hiding Place"" If you don't want to buy either dvds or if you want a preview, you can find them on YouTube in multiple parts.",1393718400,,594,4.333333333333333
