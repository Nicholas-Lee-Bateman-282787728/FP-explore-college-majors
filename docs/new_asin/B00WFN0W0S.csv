8713264,5,B00WFN0W0S,"Alicia Vikander is one of the most exciting young acting talents around.  Nominated for an Oscar in 2016, she has just received Best Supporting Actress at the Critic's Awards for 'The Danish Girl.  She has a plethora of film releases and pending releases and was magnificent in Ex-Machina.  She carried the film Testament of Youth which surprisingly did not receive the accolades it warranted.  Her meteoric rise is owed to the director Lisa Langseth who took a chance with her in the film Pure (recommended) and again in this film Hotell. This is an intelligent film and an important one for this young lady.  With certainty she is going to be a big star and lovers of film and rare acting talent will seek out her early work.",1453248000,7,727,4.6484375
