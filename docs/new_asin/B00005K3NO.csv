7942732,4,B00005K3NO,"you may start watching this and prematurely decide you hate it.  You can definitely see it's a very low budget film (the black and white helps cover it up a bit) but the writing is pure gold.  The laughs may be a bit mild at first but once the robot starts interacting with his ""father"" the clever dialog will hit you.. and hit you hard.  At that point the cheap design of the robot and it's unemotional body language adds to the hilarity. I'm damn proud to have found this movie and to have incorporated it into my collection.",1216598400,,527,4.303030303030303

7942734,4,B00005K3NO,"This movie is original and clever.  A computer A.I. that can't do math is so ironic I loved it.  The computer is a more successful human than its depressed and brilliant creator.  The only reason I did not give this movie a 5 is the computer's voice is hard to understand at times, subtitles would of helped greatly.  Production costs were low and it shows.  This movie really makes me realize how good of a movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is.",1083542400,2,449,4.36144578313253
7942735,5,B00005K3NO,"I saw this movie at the Egyptian in Los Angeles a few months ago.  Finally a science fictional movie where they put more thought into the story than the special effects.  It's both comical and poignant.  Ike is a homemade robot who is troubled by how hopelessly unhappy Charles, his nerdy creator is.  Ike, being a robot, has no trouble figuring out how the female mind works, which is something his scientist ""father"" could never hope to do.  He practices on women over the phone, and then in Cyrano fashion arranges for one of them to meet Charles.  He gives Charles dating lessons and thus manages to bootstrap his creator into a relationship that he is totally incapable of sustaining.  We can relate to Charles' social ineptitude and how he lapses into depression, but what is most moving is the robot's despair.  For all his analytical ability, Ike cannot save this one human who means everything to him.

The acting is on target and the dialog efficient.  The production values are rough, but that makes the movie's wit and clear sense of itself all the more refreshing.",993686400,5,1077,4.711229946524064
