5017010,5,B006TXDQI0,"Like most movies with ""cult"" followings, LITTLE BIG HORN is these days only known by a relatively small number of fans.

This is the story of a cavalry patrol trying to warn Lt. Col. George Custer that Gen. Crook has been defeated by the Sioux (at the Battle of the Rosebud), and the same fate may await ""Yellowhair"" himself. Other patrols ordered back to the main body have been ambushed by hostiles and destroyed-- will the same happen to the one led by Capt. Donlin (Lloyd Bridges)?

With shadowy film noir-ish cinematography, a tight script and fine cast, this major western from a minor studio is one you won't soon forget!

LITTLE BIG HORN is also available on the DVD double-feature,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WESTERN-FILM-NOIR-VOL-1/dp/B000HC2LMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WESTERN FILM NOIR, VOL. 1)</a>, along with RIMFIRE (1949).

5017011,5,B006TXDQI0,"This was a slow movie but the antisipation for something  to happen never did in the end, but i stayed with film to the end. Based on a true story, this was interesting. Writers could have written the end a little different. The quality was perfect. I like john ireland and  bridges. I like the fact it was on time with the mailing. Paul",1464480000,,337,4.25
5017012,5,B006TXDQI0,Early fifties cowboy western story about a 7th cavalry patrol that tried to warn General Custer. Lots of close up riding scenes. The outdoor scenes are beautiful even in black and white. The story is basically the reluctance of the patrol members to warn the General Custer lead by a fanatical captain determined with warning him. The final scene is the great- the charge of this group against impossible odds. This charge scene is available from YouTube,1461888000,2,454,4.909090909090909
5017013,4,B006TXDQI0,"This is a great story for ages 9 on up.  It is a story that depicts a story, based upon an alleged group of soldiers, that I had not never heard about.
The ending gives the probability that they did exist, and that there is a probability the story has somewhat a factual basis.  All in all, I enjoyed the story.  It is filmed in typical format for the date the movie was released.",1457049600,,380,4.108108108108108

5017020,4,B006TXDQI0,"A really fun B movie.  A group of soldiers try to warn Custer and fight each other as well as Sioux Indians.  This sounds like pretty standard Cowboy and Indians stuff, and it is.  However, the whole cast, Lloyd Bridges, John Ireland, and even Sheb Wooley (and identifiable B movie supporting actors like Marie Winsor) have a script which keeps things moving.

5017025,4,B006TXDQI0,"Based on a true story it follows a small group of soldiers as they try to reach Colonel Custer before he reaches the Little Big Horn and warn him of the huge amount of Sioux that are awaiting him.  I have to respect the way the story was presented.  In it's own way it subtly gives you insight into most of the men in the group without appearing so.  That keeps you interested in them.  The film stars Lloyd Bridges and John Ireland who both love the same woman - Bridges wife.  A good company of character actors include Hugh O'Brian, Reed Hadley, King Donovan, etc.  Worth a watch.  Entertaining.",1412640000,2,598,4.381818181818182

5017028,4,B006TXDQI0,"There are many 'B' movies that stick with you, that gain a wider recognition than they deserve and this is one of them. Why? Because the essential ingredients for storytelling are there: strong script, accurate depiction of military protocol under stressful conditions and fine on-location photography. Sure, it's a depiction of some troopers from the 7th Cavalry attempting the impossible, reaching Custer in time to thwart a mis-match in numbers. Do they make it in time? It doesn't matter because the troopers are fighting hostiles at every turn, and among themselves fatigue, thirst and inter-group rivalry. The cast is led by LLoyd Bridges who taught his sons a thing or two about bad breaks. In this 1951 film Lloyd plays a hardened trooper dead set on meeting 7th Cavalry standards (while losing his wife's affections) with steely nerve while within a year he got typecast as the town coward in ""High Noon."" His troopers,here, from the get-go are smartly dressed and ably led in all their protocols. With a minimum of dialogue all the grousing, complaining and jealousies that occur in a small detachment get revealed in such a realistic manner, that after a few close encounters with hostile Indians with brutally-depicted stunts, you want these driven men to succeed so that future generations will know. This film is about the effort, the struggle, the discipline, the leadership, tenacity, endurance, intelligence; as old as Homer. A lot of future war movies owe their success to this cavalry gem. The cast of unknowns here became TV legends: Jim Davis, ""Whirly Birds,"" Hugh O'Brien ""Wyatt Earp,"" Sheb Wooley ""Rawhide,"" with Lloyd Bridges snorkelling in ""Sea Hunt.""  If only ""Lone Survivor"" (2013) could have learned from this film and its taut, smart script by Charles Marquis Warren. Double his kudos for directing. This is no ""F-troop."" No, sah!",1401840000,8,1859,5.0950819672131145

8504204,4,B006TXDQI0,"Perhaps the finest film to come from 'quickie' producer Lippert, this grim story of a band of cavalry attempting to warn Custer of the danger of the Sioux uprising prior to the Battle of Little Big Horn holds up well after over 65 years. Outstanding performances by Bridges, Ireland and the ""Queen of the B's"", Marie Windsor; and a great supporting cast over-shadow what must have been a minuscule budget. Although the film claims to be based on a true incident, the curator of the Custer Battlefield Monument denies such an occurrence. Nonetheless, it's a great story that could have happened and is acted and filmed realistically!",1500508800,,632,4.91588785046729
