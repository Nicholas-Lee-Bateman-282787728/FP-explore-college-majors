8320949,5,B001MBTSLI,"This episode of Will and Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge is, in my opinion, a pleasant and engaging interaction between the bright minds of that age who, in delectable and cordial confabulations, discuss the topics of Socialism, Culture, America, Power, Supremacy, and the like. Near the end of the broadcast, three scholars discuss with Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge their similar and differing views of the relevant topic at hand which engenders this intriguing sense of interest to thirsty minds and vacuous thoughts. I find this broadcast absolutely outstanding and am very appreciative of it's depth and content, which brings much superb delight to the intellect.",1446422400,,652,5.401960784313726
