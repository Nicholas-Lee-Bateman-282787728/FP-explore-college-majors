7132735,3,B00WKMLNWK,"This is a classic novel that has fallen short on the big screen.  It must be hard condensing 1,000 + pages into about five hours.  The movies were just not as compelling as the book.  The first movie was great and then the second movie was good but the third in the series lacked something.  The acting was good in all the movies.  But, I'm thinking they just ran out of money by the third one.
There is hope though... I hear someone is making a 10 hour series made for television.",1433376000,12,481,4.184782608695652
7132736,3,B00WKMLNWK,"Honestly, I bought this because I wasn't sure I wanted to read the book.  The story is good, and I have become curious enough that I will likely now actually read the book.  I guess I may be jaded on the quality of the movies because of what I have come to expect from a movie these days.  I could tell it was low budget.  I found it strange that all the actors changed from movie to movie.  Dagny Taggart was played by three different women in the three different parts.  It is worth the cost, but don't expect what you would from an ""in theater"" movie.",1432598400,9,554,4.130841121495327

7132738,5,B00WKMLNWK,"It took me many years to finally read the book, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed the DVD trilogy.  It very closely follows the book.  The only negative I find is the changing of actors in each of the movies.  Most of the main characters are played by 3 different actors across the trilogy.  Other than that, it is thoroughly enjoyable.",1514678400,,368,4.27536231884058
7132739,1,B00WKMLNWK,The plot is so funny and so full of logic holes that it is really more of bad fantasy rather than just bad SF.,1511481600,,110,3.625
7132740,5,B00WKMLNWK,Having seen the first and second in the series and not being able to find the third I was pleased to find them all in one set at a very reasonable price. I enjoy them over and over and share with friends,1509667200,,203,3.857142857142857
7132741,5,B00WKMLNWK,"This rendition of Ayn Rand's novel is something I will watch multiple times. If you loved the novel, you'll love this series.",1508976000,,125,4.7272727272727275
7132742,3,B00WKMLNWK,"Film one - stirring, thoughtful, gripping, and good performances by all. Two - suffered by comparison to one. Three - had mixed feelings when John Galt's character was saved from torture because it seemed rough justice for all who'd had to suffer from this melodramatic schlock. However, one was very good, plus it stayed on Ayn Rand's message.",1507334400,,344,4.948275862068965
7132743,3,B00WKMLNWK,"Begins with a guy that has made a new/lighter/stronger metal which is good as gasoline if $40 a gallon so train travel is the most economical form of transportation. The government resorts to Teddy Roosevelt-style trust busting, a secondary story about a forgotten engine that can run on electricity pulled from the air. (Wouldn't that be great!)

II is about the government's ongoing constriction of business and moguls leaving their business, and the mysterious engine.

III finds the moguls in a utopian commune away from government authority. Society collapses due to no more manufacturing. The government hauls into custody the guy responsible for the break-up of manufactured society and resorts to torturing him...to death and then he recovers to issue an additional edict. Unknown who/what he is supposed to represent: Jesus? Anti-Christ?",1506902400,,846,5.401515151515151
7132744,3,B00WKMLNWK,"Having read the book years ago, I was excited to see that there was a movie made of the novel. The movie is in three parts, and with each part, the movie lost ground, the actors weren't as good, and the plot line left the novel and continued on into a hot mess. I would recommend watching the first video in this series which starts Taylor Shilling of Orange is the New Black. She's wonderful and so are the rest of the actors, but she's still working with a weak plot. As relevant as the idea that Ayn Rand put forward so long ago, the characters are as dated as a an episode of Dynasty would be today.
Save your money and read the book. The important thing to take away from the novel/movie, is that once the masses figure out that they can vote the goodies they want without the hard work that go along with it, they do, until the geniuses of the world get tired of having their work stolen by the slackers and take off leaving the masses to their own devices.",1506124800,2,963,4.182795698924731

7132747,1,B00WKMLNWK,"OMG SO TERRIBLE!! I LOVED the book, the movie was painful to watch. Bad acting, none of the richness of the characters came out. In fact, the opposite. They seemed superficial and stupid. It was like a bad soap opera.  SO DISAPPOINTED.",1502064000,,235,4.595238095238095

7132750,3,B00WKMLNWK,"While the story is very interesting and so similiar to the beliefs held today by many Milennials (not all) the movie being cut into 3 segments was the first mistake kin my opinion and even worse, the changing of the main character's in each movie was beyond disappointing and...thoroughly took all enjoyment of watching it by the third part...I watched it with someone that didn't read the book and even they felt the changes were too much to accept. I'd reccomend the book over the movie...maybe one day someone will get it right and remake this awesome story?",1499644800,2,561,4.73469387755102
7132751,5,B00WKMLNWK,"This trilogy set met our expectations as we read the many reviews concerning the 3 sets of actors/actresses for each video. It is sad that Hollywood is seemingly only concerned about making movies that exploit their liberal point of view. Atlas Shrugged is an amazing book that is so very applicable to what is happening in America today, yet this book was written in the 50's. Incredible story to point out the conflict between doers and takers. Who do we want to emulate - Washington thugs or innovators?",1498262400,2,506,4.761363636363637

7132758,4,B00WKMLNWK,"There is no way the movie could live up to the novel. After 2 attempts I was able to finish the book. That's the only way to appreciate the movie and accept it's shortcomings. Francisco I thought was a Latin-lover-type but the 3rd disc showed him looking like a fat slob. The characters were 30-somethings and the movie showed them all over the map age-wise. The novel is 60 years old and too much applies today. As I see it Hank Reardon is Donald Trump, Dagny Taggert is played by a low profile Kelly Anne Conway and Jim Galt is played by Mr. Bannon. I don't know about Francisco.",1489276800,,581,4.339449541284404
7132759,5,B00WKMLNWK,"After listening to the audio version - and amazed at its relevance today - I really wanted to see the movie.  I was surprised at the modern setting of the movie compared to what I had envisioned from the book.  The movie really brought the story up to date.  If at all possible, I would suggest reading the book (or listening to it) prior to seeing the movie. Either way, Atlas Shrugged is more of a movement than simply entertainment.",1488844800,,435,4.4125

7132766,5,B00WKMLNWK,The movie trilogy follows the book well. The change of actors is a little distracting but not enough to downgrade the set. The principles Ayn Rand eloquently defined and explained in her book came across loud and clear and are as timelessly true today as ever. The fact that the vehicle of transportation was trains instead of airplanes is  pretty much irrelevant. The characteristic behavior of government and those who depend on government for favors is historic and destructive as always and comes through in the movie to anyone who is not sleeping.,1486944000,2,552,4.935483870967742

7132774,5,B00WKMLNWK,"Excellent three films with three different sets of actors and directors but all true to the story...amazingly so.  I think the negative reviews are by those who do not agree with Ayn Rand rather than the quality of the movies. Granted, you have to be sympathetic to a libertarian view of the world to enjoy fully, but all the actors do a good job and the screenplay dialogue is right out of the book. I think Ayn Rand fans will enjoy and feel these adaptations are as good as feature films can do.",1484092800,,497,4.344086021505376
7132775,5,B00WKMLNWK,"This is an incredible movie. I would recommend everyone watch it and read the book. Some things are a little off, but the book was written in the '50s predicting the future. A must see.",1483574400,,185,4.314285714285714

7132779,1,B00WKMLNWK,I got the trilogy DVD set and it is terrible. The acting is bad but whats worse is they changed the main characters in each of the DVDs which made it not only hard to follow but you did not care about the characters any more.  They need to remake this movie. The book is good but don't bother with the movie.,1481500800,,308,3.967741935483871

7132787,5,B00WKMLNWK,"This is a great novel to begin with.  It is great exposure to the theories of Ayn Rand for those not willing to read a book the size of a large bible.  I enjoyed it & use it to show family members who don't necissarily share the same passions as i do.  Outside of philosophy it is a great & extremely well created story.  One of the top selling books in history. Last i heard it was the second highest selling hard cover behind only the bible.  It was also scheduled to be created during Rand's life with a star studded cast but she would not give up creative approval & therefore we have this production later but in accordance with her wishes & true to story.

All that being said the critique is on production.  Has the feel or ambiance of a tv mini series even though the budget was higher.  The cast is great but changes from episode to episode, which could cause some problems following character development.

I really enjoyed this series.",1475020800,,946,4.36
7132788,1,B00WKMLNWK,"Very disappointed in this trilogy. Different actors in each DVD, which I find deplorable. The whole set just didn't capture the soul of the books. The characters in the film were pretty much lifeless and dull, so much so that you really don't care what happens to them. I've read the book several times over the years and fell in love with the characters as written by Rand. She is probably rolling in her grave with this adaptation!",1474243200,,433,4.564102564102564
7132789,5,B00WKMLNWK,"This movie set came highly recommended by a dear friend. All he said was it would shine a light on what socialism was like in a society that embraced it. Not into political exposs as entertainment. However, once I started watching the first DVD I couldn't stop. The story is absolutely riveting and on a deeper level frightening. You can actually see how this political and economic theory can go so bad so easily. I'm not saying that there is a perfect social practice- there are downsides to all of them, even our beloved democracy. The key is to chose the one that does the least harm, allows the most individual freedom while preserving the strength of the group.  All in all, it is entertaining and thought provoking.",1473465600,,722,4.640625
7132790,2,B00WKMLNWK,Good video quality but the 3rd movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. Better to watch the first 2 and make up your own 3. It will be much better.,1473292800,,151,3.606060606060606

7132798,5,B00WKMLNWK,"Based on Ayn Rand's book ""Atlas Shrugged"", this was written in the 50's I believe, but it is uncanny that the subject matter is very relevant to 2016.  The subject is what happens when the establishment government officials try to take over the US and turn it into a communist/socialist/Utopia country.  The phrases that are being used today by the left are taken directly out of this movie or so it seems.  It is well acted out and not overly done, has a really good story to it and is entertaining as well as the mystery of ""Who Is John Galt"".  If you are a patriot you need to see this movie!

Depicting the story in the future ruined the experience for me!  Rearden metal and Taggart Railroad would be barely relevant in 2016/17.  Try composite materials and Space X, if you want to make this believable, but that would not be true to the book.

To make/produce a great movie version of 'Atlas Shrugged', you need the John Galt of film makers!

This movie version is mediocre at best and in some ways an insult to Ayn Rand.",1454284800,3,428,4.405063291139241

I think it is an interesting choice to have separate casts for each part of the story. That can make the thread a challenge to follow. I read the book first and had no trouble following the story with different actors. I had a month or more between each of the 3 movies which may have helped me to follow the plot.

7132833,4,B00WKMLNWK,"I had to invest a lot of time thinking the ""Atlas Shrugged"" film series before I could decide what I thought about it.  The 3-film series suffers from having insufficient budget and a different cast for the same lead characters in each film, but I is a very good presentation of the original story and Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism.

It tends to be rather preachy in spots, but then, so is Ayn Rand.  I won't attempt to evaluate the objectivism philosophy here other than to mention that it can be quite a mind stretcher to think about, while at the same time comes with a strong caution against allowing this or any philosophy to be an excuse for sociopathic behavior.

The actors kept changing, but the ones they did get to play the leading roles did an excellent job with the characters and the director managed to keep it all bound together and consistent throughout all three movies.  Within the limited budget, production values are excellent, and the Blu-ray packaging is flawless.",1452729600,,995,4.728323699421965
7132834,5,B00WKMLNWK,"Its not often that a product of Hollywood contains a message for conservatives. Wow, is that an understatement! When the audience is conservative Christians, the air is event thinner. So, when a movie that extols the virtues of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and hard work, it should attract the attention of the Christian community.
This production is a three-part cinematic adaptation of Ayn Rands perennial best-selling novel. Its about a woman and a man with a dream worth fighting for. They fight against a juggernaut of immoral and corrupt businessmen and politicians who refuse to embrace their dream because it would mean relinquishing their power. Remarkably, more than 50 years after its initial publication, Atlas Shruggeds depiction of government overreach and duplicitous politics appears to mimic todays headlines. The movies bring a strong message as a counterpoint to the government-as-benefactor message that seems to be prevalent in todays political dialogue.
Todays progressive rhetoric rightly identifies the exclusion of minorities, whose opportunities are checked by those with power while the institutions which wield power for the good of the majority go unchecked. Atlas Shrugged shows how the efforts of the smallest of all minorities, the Individual, are being squashed by government institutions in the name of the public good. The heroes of Atlas Shrugged refuse to be victims. Their response is both inspiring and uplifting. Individual liberty, it is clear, is good for all of us.
Instead of relying on the government, the heroes of the story understand that the government is not meant to be the benefactor of the people. As a Christian, I have seen how the government usurps the traditional role of the Christian community in society at large. When Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of New Jersey, our church arrived on the scene only to be turned away by FEMA. Assessing damages and writing checks would have been more difficult if the mass of construction and repair volunteers went to work before the government completed the painstaking process of inspection. Further, we were told to relay the message that our assistance was not wanted. We were discouraged, to say the least. In Atlas Shrugged, the main characters rise above the oppression of a powerfulbut self-destructingpolitical machine.
Movies like the Atlas Shrugged Trilogy do not come around often. They don't get the backing of major studios and flashy star-power. The message--individual liberty, personal responsibility, and hard workis compelling and inspiring: an oasis in a dry and thirsty land, where there is no water.",1452643200,32,2636,5.369565217391305

7132846,4,B00WKMLNWK,"Making this movie(s) was a difficult task at best. I read the book and watched the first 2 movies on Netflix so I knew what to expect. Different actors for each movie and I can see why, with a long timetable for shooting and a small budget. This probably off put the actors from each movie. If Peter Jackson were involved he would have had a cast of thousands and a budget of hundreds of millions and made every chapter a different movie. And it wouldn't have been that much better.

After the initial shock of seeing the different actors you get used to them once again and are less distracted. You can see that all of the actors put their best effort into the roles. I won't nitpick the screen writing, after all it is simply not possible to put this on film note for note. Galt's speech in the book is 80 pages and a bear to get through even reading at a leisurely pace.

In the case of this story not so much.
Its a tremendous injustice that they didn't retain the same cast for all 3 parts of the book. The 1st Dagny i thought was spot on. And Dagny is paramount to the tale. There were also tremendous character actors for the many roles in this story who also were only in one part not all. That is especially notable in this box set.

Sadly, the trilogy, besides being poorly cast to manipulate the outcome- and that seems to be the point of making these movies- to hoodwink the consumer even more than they have been by some corporations in the past.  Creativity appears to be the desired asset of the heroes of the movie- a creativity that is only a copy of imported extraterrestrial technology.
On reading some Sitchin or Tellinger one can realize this is a fantasy to employ obedient youth in the service of global warming.  Note how the technologies are of the present but the problems raised have been solved by conscientious workers already.  This is a sales pitch of Annunaki to bury us in our own mining dross.

I no sooner got used to the new actors (who did a splendid job), and the actors switched again in Volume III. All-in-all, though, the films were faithful to Ayn Rand's novel. They were seamlessly updated to today's world with modern technology that did not exist in the late 50s.
