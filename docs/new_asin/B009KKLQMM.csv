5344329,5,B009KKLQMM,"I love that you can pre-order all the newest Lego DVDs thru Amazon. This new Ninjago DVD comes at a great time as a stocking stuffers. Cute episodes with no violence, yet enough action to satisfy 4-8 yr olds. The green ninja is a favorite, sort of the new Guy in the block. Walking, talking Lego figures that kids love. Highly recommended.",1355616000,,339,4.483870967741935
5344330,5,B009KKLQMM,Fast shipment of DVD and the was product intact. No damage or issues. Please note this is a Christmas give and has not been opened,1355529600,,130,4.24
5344331,3,B009KKLQMM,I guess shame on me for not realizing it was only 7 episodes but shame on Amazon for decreasing the price a day after it was released.  I pre-ordered this item in November for a 11 Dec release and today 12 Dec the price is already $2.50 less than what I paid for the pre-order.  I'm sure my son will love this but I know he is going to be disappointed it is not the whole season.,1355270400,9,379,3.909090909090909
5344332,5,B009KKLQMM,"The Ninjago series is great for kids who are infatuated with ninjas but are too young for the violence found in martial art movies. It satisfies their ninja needs. It also has a great message- the search for an inner purpose or their ""FULL POTENTIAL"".",1351123200,27,251,4.6
5344333,5,B009KKLQMM,My boys love these movies and they are very age appropriate.  Kung Fu Panda gets them wound up but not these ones.  Now they want to take Ninja class.  Thank you Lego and please make more!,1389225600,,188,4.166666666666667
5344334,4,B009KKLQMM,My 9 year old enjoys this series.  He missed some episodes and rather than track them down on TV this was an easier way for him to catch up.,1378771200,,140,3.8275862068965516
5344335,2,B009KKLQMM,"My kids love this but I had no idea this was only half of a season.  They don't even sell the other half on it's own.  So you have to buy the full season anyways if you want to watch the whole thing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lego-Ninjago-Masters-of-Spinjitzu-Season-Two/dp/B00AY77XJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu Season Two</a>",1378166400,6,404,6.75
5344336,5,B009KKLQMM,Very satisfied. With my purchase thank you my little son was her super happy I will be back for more!,1375315200,,101,4.1
5344337,2,B009KKLQMM,"watch out this only contains 7 episodes of season two not the entire season, i bought this without that knowledge otherwise it's ninjago",1374624000,,136,4.956521739130435
5344338,4,B009KKLQMM,"I bought this for my grandson and he was thrilled. Whenever I need something, the first place I look is Amazon. Usually, they have it.",1374192000,,134,4.4
5344339,5,B009KKLQMM,My grandson has been waiting for this to come to dvd since last fall. He's been a Ninjago addict for a little more than 3 years now.,1366329600,,132,3.925925925925926
5344340,4,B009KKLQMM,"My son lives and breaths Ninjago's, so he was supper excited to get this, which it was longer but he enjoyed it anyway!",1362960000,,119,4.217391304347826
5344341,5,B009KKLQMM,Great book for encouraging beginning readers.  It was perfect for a stocking stuffer and corresponded with the physical Ninjago Lego set.,1361923200,,137,5.523809523809524
5344342,5,B009KKLQMM,"only thing that i have to say is this is not the full season2 dvd disk
this is like a part 1 of season 2. however, as a parent, when you start the dvd, you don't have to go through annoying preview or other stuff
you put the disk, menu will load and hit the play button. it's perfect for busy parents!!",1360800000,6,302,3.8870967741935485
5344343,1,B009KKLQMM,i am very upset as my son of 6 yrs payed for this dvd out of his pocket money. it took nearly two weeks to arrive and when it finally did it didn't work on his dvd player or any in the house it said wrong region. thats fair enough but it should be made clear when you place an order.,1360108800,,283,3.6557377049180326
5344344,5,B009KKLQMM,"My grandsons, 3 and 6 thought this was great. They are fans of ninjago and watch it on TV. Fun",1359417600,,94,3.75
5344345,2,B009KKLQMM,"This series seemed cute for my 6 year old boy who loved Ninjago Legos before seeing the show.  The first few seemed interesting and funny, it seems they are getting increasingly bizarre and creepy, the emphasis has shifted from adventure and humor to instilling fear in my little viewer.  He still loves Ninjago Legos, but does not care to watch this series anymore.  It's a bit heavy and stressful for a young person, too bad, it could have been cool without the excess creepiness.",1359331200,,482,4.714285714285714
5344346,5,B009KKLQMM,"For young fans of Ninjago, this hits the spot.  I gave it as a holiday gift to my five year old grandson and it was a hit.",1359331200,,122,3.5185185185185186

5344348,5,B009KKLQMM,Rating based on fact that young boy requested this DVD via a gift tree for families having difficulty providing gifts for their family.,1357862400,,135,4.913043478260869
5344349,5,B009KKLQMM,Great DVD to follow the previous Ninjago DVD's. One of my son's favorite. Waiting now for the rest of the series.,1357862400,,113,4.428571428571429

5344351,3,B009KKLQMM,"We don't have cable, so were waiting eagerly for the release of this DVD to catch up on what we had missed in the land of Ninjago.  A bit belatedly (like Christmas morning) I realized this was not the entire season.  The episodes are good -but we are still left hanging.",1356652800,,270,4.2745098039215685
5344352,5,B009KKLQMM,My boys got this for Christmas and have watched it three times already. They love the movie and then play out scenes with their lego ninjago people.,1356480000,,148,4.518518518518518

8542506,4,B009KKLQMM,"Amusing story even for adults who want to unwind, but are too tired to deal with a ""real"" movie or TV.

These episodes show the early days of Lloyd as the Green Ninja...eventual Green Ninja. He is the youngest and has not yet grown big enough to go answer emergencies with the other hero ninja. The character is realistic, and acts like a boy would act - ex: disappointed when left ""safe"" at the apartment to work out, but doesn't get an ""attitude"" or go off on his own, as many modern rebellious characters would.

The dragons are fun to see. There is even a scene where the chore of cleaning up after them is passed along. lol. Just like real pets!

Unlike many martial arts stories, there is NO emphasis on seeking occult powers, mastering dangerous forbidden objects, or disgracing the enemy. Though the villain has an army of Snake People, and sometimes brings his Bone people, this is no different than any other enemy the ninja face.

The sister character is treated respectfully too.

No worries about bad role models here. Also shows kids that being a ninja, or anything else worth being, takes long hours of work over years. Be sure to point that out when the cartoon shows this - it's like that in our world too.",1417305600,,1223,4.515837104072398
8542507,5,B009KKLQMM,"At first I didn't think Ninjago was something I wanted for my grandsons - more cartoon violence hyping a product to kids.  But the boys wanted Ninjago, so I bought the first season and watched it beforehand.  I found it to be immensely clever, entertaining, and I applauded the little social lessons sprinkled thru the actions.  This latest in the series keeps up the tradition.  Pros: engages the kids, has some worthwhile content, excellent animation.  Cons: fighting and some violence, but more justified than gratuitous.  Still, you can never be sure if kids are telling the difference.  I like to sit with them and watch (sometimes for the 4th & 5th times) so I can try to catch problematic messages and re-interpret out loud.  It's tough to get philosophical with a 4 and 5 yr old, but it's simple to remind them that these are TOYS trying to do the right thing.  Besides, I grew up with Mighty Mouse and Bugs Bunny.  Now THERE'S some life-lesson material.  And I think I still turned out ok.  I think.",1411257600,,1008,4.632768361581921
