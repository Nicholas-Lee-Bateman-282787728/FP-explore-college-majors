8223142,5,B000WG11KU,"What surprised me the most about this documentary was the technologies offered in analyzing human body parts. I had always heard that at old age, pumping iron is the best exercise for health but never understood why till I saw the analysis of these skeletons in Sahara. Amazing how much info a human skeleton and tooth can reveal not only about the physical strength of an individual but more importantly if such individual has ever experienced any stress during their childhood even after few hundred years of skeletons being buried in the sand. Very informative. Bravo.",1426118400,,571,4.958333333333333

8223144,5,B000WG11KU,"National Geographic's ""Skeletons of the Sahara"" is about skeletons of the Sahara and much more.  I have watched this several times because it is densely packed not only information on two cultures that lived in the Sahara before the Egyptians built the pyramids, showing how they were found, and the methods used to determine their age and social environment.

The only drawback is several times they ask questions implying that we do not know the answers.  It is possible that someone might not have known that the Sahara was once luscious vegetation; but instead of just coming out and saying it is implied over and over and over again.

However there are many eye openers.  For some reason I was not aware that you could read the enamel layers on teeth just like you can rings on a tree.  And there were several other surprises on the archaeology methods.

All-in-all this documentary is a keeper.  It is not a bunch of sound bites like some documentaries.  There is no mention of aliens from outer space.  The narration is quite well organized.",1389571200,,1048,4.740331491712707
