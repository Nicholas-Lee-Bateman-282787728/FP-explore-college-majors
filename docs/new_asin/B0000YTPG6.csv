All the people interview were seemingly very intelligent and had something important to say. The arial shots of the formations left me in a reverant awe, and almost overwhelmed by their sheer sacred beauty.  The large body of proof provided as well as the inhuman complexity and perfection of the formations make an almost irrifutable case for the authentisity of Crop Circles.",1083715200,8,518,5.142857142857143

The beauty and designs are really quite extraordinary and many of the crop circles shown in this documentary are extremely intricate and artistic.

Nothing is resolved about the mysterious origins of these phenomena but the examination of the many results is rewarding to those who may have an interest in such things.

1959951,1,B0000YTPG6,"What a lame and one-sided documentary. Weren't there a couple of guys in England who admitted to being responsible for hundreds of these crop circles all over England for a good 20 years? They never once present opposing evidence, interview people who claim to have made crop circles -- showing the differences between such man-made crop circles and the unclaimed crop circles would have been at least more amusing. These people are all so wacky and off the wall in their wide-eyed belief of some unknown, unseen and unproven extraterrestrial visitors that it's just sad (and not in a funny way like the Trekkies documentary).",1316563200,,626,4.9714285714285715
1959952,5,B0000YTPG6,"Crop Circles - Quest For Truth is an excellent documentary from visionary director William Gazecki (who has also directed documentaries about Jacques Fresco & the Venus Project) about the ""crop circle"" phenomenon, it's meaning, origins and possible implications for the human race. It is presented from a sympathetic point of view, and doesn't concentrate on the negative aspects such as hoaxing as most mainstream documentaries are won't to do in their attempts to convince the public that this is the main part of the story. Rather, it is filmed as objectively as possible, with any conclusions drawn being very simply ""we don't know"" or ""we cannot say for certain"". Naturally there are certain aspects of the story which we ARE sure of, such as the presence of the anomalies outlined below, and the fact that human-made hoaxes do not contain these anomalies lead many serious researchers to conclude that the genuine formations are most definitely not made by human hands. Strangely enough, governments and the mouthpieces of officialdom have inadvertently confirmed this thesis by claiming they are definitively a meteorological phenomenon - and therefore likewise not made by human hands. That the claimed meteorological phenomena occur in very specific locations, under very specific conditions and at very specific times, and that none of the required criteria for the formation of these phenomena are met in many many instances is beside the point.

The film contains interviews with many interested parties, from philosophers considering those implications for humanity should contact with alien intelligence be confirmed, to scientists examining the plants and soil for biological and chemical changes, interspersed with stunning video and still images of formations, and is as balanced and objective as any documentary you will see. For anyone half convinced the whole phenomenon is faked, this documentary should make you think twice.

Genuine ""crop circles"" exhibit such artistry, size, and sheer perfection, often containing geometric patterns of such complexity that only computers can simulate, which in and of themselves seem to preclude any notion of their having been created by any human hands let alone a couple of hired (not tired, although that too...) old men with a stick and some string. I refer of course to Doug & Dave and others of that painfully inadequate ilk. They also exhibit the following anomalies which human-made formations do not contain:

No tracks leading to or from genuine formations. Formations formed some time within 30 minutes in some proven instances, despite huge size. No half-completed or ""practise"" formations found. Near-total perfection in the precision and layout of geometric shapes (those we can actually understand, that is!)

Plants not flattened and damaged but folded over and interwoven intricately in the most amazing patterns; where they are folded the stems are somehow biologically altered and healed, and the growth rate of these plants is significantly increased. Additionally, the growth rate for a linearly-decreasing distance around the formation is also superior to distant growth.

There are also what appear to be steam release holes blown in the then-healed bent-over nodes of some plants which often still thrive. These appear to attest to the presence of some kind of heat energy, possibly microwave.

Magnetic anomalies in and around formations. Microscopic magnetic spheres of unknown origin are left scattered in the soil. It is unknown whether it is these, or something else, which also creates huge variations in the magnetic field in and around the formation, with North fluctuating up to 15 degrees from true at times.

Light anomalies; photographs taken within newly-formed formations often show multiple ghost images which seem to be only explainable by variations in the speed of light within the formation itself.

There are possibly even aerial anomalies and/or gravitational anomalies: On the 22nd of October 1987 a very bizarre event occurred in the air over southern England. A Harrier TR5 vertical take-off jump jet disappeared during a test flight over the Salisbury Plain military zone in Wiltshire. As the jet approached Boscombe Down airbase, radio contact went dead and the aircraft went missing. A full land, sea and air search was launched. The Harrier was eventually spotted by an American military aircraft flying over South Wales. The American pilot spotted the Harrier flying on a set course and moved in alongside it sending a radio report of his finding. The canopy of the plane was shattered and there was no pilot flying the Harrier indicating the pilot had ejected out of the plane through the canopy.

The media named the Harrier the Ghost Plane. The plane eventually ran out of fuel and crashed 300 miles out into the Atlantic Ocean. The plane had flown over three series of crop circles and the body of the pilot was later found very close to a set of circles. Although the presence of circles was not that unusual in that area at that time of year, a dead pilot was.

Whilst of course there is no proof the ejection was caused by the formations, it is interesting that the military then approached the author for information about unexplained anomalies around these formations. He shared information on associated electromagnetic anomalies and various other phenomena, as they were investigating all possible explanations for the strange series of events including why the pilot was ejected from his craft through the canopy. An explanation was never found and the verdict was left open.

One of the strangest aspects of the whole story was that the pilot's body was found in such a place as to indicate he had ejected a second or two before flying over the formations, and that the course track appeared to show the Harrier was on auto-pilot and that it actually changed course a fraction of a second before flying over the centre of the three formations. It then remained unchanged again until it ran out of fuel. Unconnected? I am inclined to think not - the course change just before the formations is very obvious on the course track.

Additionally there are ""balls of light"" often witnessed before and after new formations and caught on video camera a few times. There is also no explanation for these.

These are only some of the strange ""things"" found and experienced in and around genuine crop formations. If you are not yet aware of these things I can thoroughly recommend the documentary; it is a very good starting point for further investigation.

Put together, the anomalies listed above, and others not mentioned, together with the geometric perfection and apparent encoded mathematical references added to the apparent speed of creation, as well as the official response, all seem to suggest these formations are created by some kind of intelligent, or intelligently-guided, energy of some description which currently appears to be beyond our scope to comprehend or explain, except at least to suggest it appears to be totally benign. That the genuine formations are works of art of precision and perfection totally unsurpassed in human experience has become lost to the world of art due to government deception and their attempts to keep the phenomenon under wraps via the tame media. That they may contain the key to currently unimaginable technology is unfortunately lost on the public who are happy enough with their Play Stations and flat-screen TVs, happily lulled into brain-dead oblivion by Big Brother.

My own personal belief is that this phenomenon is an attempt by another intelligence far in advance of our own to educate the human race to look beyond our petty differences and to cast off the shackles of our current inadequate physical science and start to think in four-dimensions (and possibly more) and more specifically, in terms of tetrahedral physics as it applies to planetary mechanics. The decoding of these formations should be one of the human race's most important tasks, for within them may lie the key to free energy and easy inter-planetary propulsion. NASA Space Shuttle video footage caught an apparent missile fired from earth (""Star Wars"" weapon system?) at an object flying sedately at approximately 60,000 mph (around 40,000 mph faster than the fastest human-made object) in low earth orbit which then performed a 14,500 Earth-gravity turn and accelerated in under 2 seconds to approximately 250,000 mph, making the missile appear to stand still. This is just a hint of the potential of a higher technology; who knows just how great its potential truly is? These things are all connected, either directly or indirectly, and as always The Controllers are desperately trying to keep these amazing things from the public.

1959954,2,B0000YTPG6,"As pointed out earlier, they film fails to look for the science being done, despite claiming it does.  It would make a short film if they did.  They could just as well go to an art gallery and ask why (intentionally) unknown artists paint beautiful pictures.

What is most important is motivation which is thought to be absent.  In fact my work mate at [cellular phone co.] lived in England for over a year.  While there he saw the many crop circles come and go.  What was most telling was that they would almost exclusively appear Thursday night, just in time to be showed off on Friday's telly.  People would come out over the weekend to see them.  The poor farmer would have to charge something to compensate for all the people tramping up his crops. Such a routine would not make it into anyone's telling of the tale even though it speaks volumes.

Nice Helo shots but spare us the nonsense.  See the pretty thing.",1220918400,2,918,4.475903614457831
1959955,5,B0000YTPG6,I found the plant research portion of the DVD to be very convincing. The DVD didn't ignore tricksters but did mention the lights that haven't been explained (at least at the time of the filming). The use of controls in the plant evaluation and the fact of similar but reduced results in plants out side of the circles made the study more scientific than speculation in my opinion. I am very happy I bought a copy of it.,1220918400,2,419,4.384615384615385
1959956,2,B0000YTPG6,"Teams of human circlemakers have been creating very complex crop circle designs for decades.  This fact is well-documented, with many easy-to-find accounts in various publications in print and here on the internet.  I was disappointed that Gazecki almost entirely ignored that perspective on the debate.  Instead, this documentary places a heavy focus on unexplained/paranormal perspectives.  Humans are quite capable of quickly creating very complex designs.  While this certainly doesn't disprove paranormal explanations, this fact should have received more attention in this film.

Secondly, I would have liked to see more credibility behind the scientific evidence that is presented.  The film describes teams of scientists who have investigated crop circles, yet focuses entirely on the research of an independent scientist with no apparent institutional affiliation.  Furthermore, peer-reviewed publications are the standard mechanism for presenting novel scientific findings.  Were these results taken from a peer-reviewed publication?  If not, why should anyone consider these conclusions to be scientific?  Again, this doesn't disprove anything, but this is an important consideration that is left unaddressed.  Scientific research must meet basic standards, not defined by research that some groups may consider ""scientific"".

As far as entertainment value, this film is top notch.  In my heart, I ""want to believe"" and am quickly swept away by the possibilities.. lots of interesting ideas are presented by a number of passionate, eccentric folks.  But my stubborn, skeptical nature still persists, and for good reason.",1141603200,20,1630,5.876595744680851
1959957,5,B0000YTPG6,"Complex geometric linear and circular patterns in which vegetation is squeezed flat against the ground have appeared overnight in wheat and cornfields in 70 countries worldwide over the last 25 years. These designs, generically referred to as crop circles, seem to be created out of nothing and originate from nowhere. They are exquisite works of art but who is the artist? In his documentary, Crop Circles: Quest for Truth, Oscar nominee William Gazecki (WACO, The Rules of Engagement) interviews researchers, scientists, philosophers, and laymen in an attempt to unravel the mystery of their origin and nature. Gazecki does not approach his subject from a journalistic framework, presenting pros and cons in a conventional matter, but as a filmmaker who is telling a story with astounding implications. There are no easy answers. The formations reflect a Sacred Geometry incorporating the Phi or Golden ratio that exists in ancient architecture and art and throughout terrestrial biology including human body structure. As one researcher states, ""there is a force or energy at work that is governed by principles that are beyond the capacity of human beings"".

Crop Circles: Quest for Truth begins with archival footage of single circles from the 1980s, and then continues through the next decade, showing the deepening intricacy of the pictograms. The patterns have now evolved to the point where in August 2001 a formation appeared at Milk Hill, Wiltshire containing 409 circles making up a wheel design that is larger than two football fields. The film displays the largest collection of crop formations ever seen on screen and includes footage of strange balls of light hovering above the ground in areas where crop circles later appear. Though the documentary is a bit academic in places, tending toward the scientific and technical, the formations themselves are so breathtakingly beautiful that the film becomes an awesome experience.

Gazecki interviews scientists who look at changes in the plants or soil that are both physical and molecular, characteristics that have yet to be reproduced by man-made designs. They also discuss germination anomalies, cellular anomalies, intricate and well-structured lengthening of the nodes, exploded nodes, burn marks, and even unnatural radioactivity, all of which cannot be the result of simple mechanical flattening. The documentary considers alternative theories such as plasma vortex, the circles as three-dimensional shadows of a four-dimensional object, and electromagnetic energy from the Earth but does not spend much time with them. Also mentioned but not probed is the possibility that the patterns are man-made. It would have been interesting to hear from those who openly create circles and see how and why they do what they do. One researcher mentions that if crop circles were to be hoaxed, they would all have to be done night after night without any mistakes or partial designs and completed in five hours. This is without being discovered, leaving footprints, or being detected in any way.

Gazecki is not in doubt that some kind of conscious intelligence is at work, dancing with us, playing with us, allowing us to confront what is possible in the universe. The film, however, does not support oversimplified hypotheses like ETs or UFOs but prefers to view the phenomenon as simply an unknown. As one researcher explains, whether or not we ever succeed in unraveling the code, the very act of asking ""why"" allows us to expand our consciousness, and this may be the real purpose behind it. The crop circles may indeed be ""mandalas of the mind"", a term that Buddhists describe as ""a representation of the universe, a consecrated area that serves as...a collection point of universal forces guiding man towards a state of enlightenment or awakening"". Whatever its ultimate source, the appearance of the formations has made us aware that we live in a universe full of mystery and wonder, that science and conventional religion may not have all the answers, and that we all have a cosmic source that is now beckoning to us. Crop Circles: Quest for Truth is not a slick entertainment package and it does not always flow smoothly, but it is an intelligent and probing look at one of the most intriguing mysteries facing our planet. If you see this film and I recommend that you do, please watch it with an open mind. It may be the most important film you ever see.",1134691200,24,4426,5.127423822714682
1959958,5,B0000YTPG6,"""We're being forced to consider that this universe has all kinds of intelligences all around us that we've been ignoring...mysterious other intelligences."" - From the DVD

Director William Gazecki highlights the science and art of crop circles in his 120 minute DVD Crop Circles: Quest for Truth. This levelheaded DVD interviews crop circle expert Colin Andrews as well as scientists and crop circle enthusiasts.

Before 1990, crop circles were simple and scattered. However, as time went on, they became increasingly complex in the form of insectograms, fractals, and other geometric patterns. In fact, at the crux of sacred geometry and crop circles is the Golden Mean, which is a ratio of ""small to the large is large to the whole"".

Interviewees relate fascinating stories of crop circle sightings, including seeing infamous glowing balls that often float around the circles. For example, Andrews relays a story about flying over Stonehenge, photographing the stones, then going back to refuel the plane. On his way back-a mere 25 minutes later-there was a spiral crop circle amidst Stonehenge...in broad daylight!

There's a liberal amount of science in the Crop Circles: Quest for Truth DVD. For example, scientists discuss how seeds from crop circle plants grow differently than the control group. According to one scientist, there had to be some kind of strong energy-perhaps microwave-pulse or plasma energy--to turn parts of full-grown corn into ""exploded nodes"".

One fascinating account told of 109 circles made one rainy night-with nary a broken plant, footprint, or trail!

While hoaxsters make some crop circles, the question that many have is at 200+ crop circles every year, what is the payoff? No money is involved and supposed hoaxsters remain largely anonymous.

There are tons of extras in Crop Circles: Quest for Truth, including:

* Colin Andrews talks about the CIA (He says that they tried to get him to say it's all a hoax)

* Mysterious magnetic particles left at the scene of circles

* Military helicopters arriving at the same time as the balls of light

* Extensive photo gallery of hundreds of crop circles

* Interview with the director

The best part of this DVD, in my opinion, is the jaw-dropping crop circles in the photo gallery. Whether made by man or something else, there's no denying that these beautiful displays of organic art touch the soul and evoke feelings of wonder. A nice mix of science, speculation, experience, and intriguing footage, Crop Circles: Quest for Truth is a great DVD for those interested in the crop circle phenomenon. The crop circle photo gallery alone is well-worth the price!",1133049600,18,2645,5.109048723897912

If you have ever wondered about these amazing formations, you must watch this documentary, it makes a convincing and impressive case for these circles being alien in origin.
