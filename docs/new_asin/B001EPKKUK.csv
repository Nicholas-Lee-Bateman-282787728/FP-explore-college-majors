3557012,5,B001EPKKUK,"Saint Ignatius press has published a number of excellent Italian films on the lives of the saints. This one is definitely one of their best. I don't think I ever watched a more powerful and honest portrayal of Francis and Clare. I highly recommend this film. If you're looking for a film on Saint Francis, this is the one to buy.",1240012800,8,329,4.409836065573771
3557013,5,B001EPKKUK,"This  is a great movie about St. Francis and St. Clare.  It does an excellent job of portraying the lives they lived and their answer when God called them to leave their lives of wealth and follow him.  The movie is inspiring, the acting is outstanding, and I enjoyed learning more about these two great saints.  The movie is 200 minutes long but it will definitely hold your interest.  I agree with other reviewers who have said you will want to watch this more than once.

In Chapter 12, ""Friends Join Francis"", the writer has done a beautiful job of showing the parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of Francis.  There is a scene where a group of men (Priests?) approach the local bishop to express their concern over Francis and his followers.  They exclaim that they feel the bishop has underestimated ""the problem"" because there are more and more of them everyday -- at least a dozen - and they go around the country saying they were ordered by God.  The bishop replies that their words remind him of a story he has read several times, the Gospel, and he asks them if they have ever read it.

A 16 page booklet is included with the DVD which I found to be very useful.  It contains short biographies of Clare and Francis and lists of the important dates in their lives.  It also  includes a very informative interview with Fr. Andrew Apostolic ,C.F.R., well-known speaker and author., and a resource list.

Clare and Francis is directed by Fabrizio Costa who directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mother-Teresa/dp/B000EXDS52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mother Teresa</a>, another great film.

I recommend this movie as a great way for families to get to know more about St. Francis and St. Clare. Buy it, watch it, share it friends and family, and donate a copy to your parish library if you have one.

3557014,5,B001EPKKUK,"This movie is an excellent portrayal of the lives of Saints Francis and Clare.  It is very moving and inspiring.  Good script, well acted, and the spiritual and religious elements in the lives of Francis and Clare are woven excellently in the movie.  Two of my nephews, 15 and 11 of age, watched this movie and said that they really liked it a lot.

3557015,5,B001EPKKUK,"I received this movie as a Christmas present. Since Christmas, I have watched the movie 5 times (almost once a day during the Octave!). I would recommend this to anyone who loves these two Great Saints or who want to get to know them. I hope to begin a deeper study of them myself as I continue my own journey as a Third Order Capuchin.
I hope they come out with a soundtrack as well, for the music is magnificent!",1230768000,40,414,4.1875

3557017,5,B001EPKKUK,"I agree with the other reviewer's that this is surely the best film yet on St. Francis and St. Clare. Some of the things that stand out about it are:
- historical accuracy - it follows the historical details closer than the other films on the lives of these popular saints, including such scenes usually not in other films like their creation of the first living Nativity scene, Francis meeting with the head of the Muslims during the Crusades, and Francis encountering the dangerous wolf who befriends him
- greater presence of Clare - in all other films Clare is more of a secondary character, but in this film she is clearly given equal status  and importance as Francis, with her name even appearing first in the film title
- combines authentic spirituality with social concern - this film really balances the deep spiritual focus of both saints with their love and concern for others
- exquisite cinematography, and uniformly excellent acting performances

This is a very beautifully produced film with outstanding acting performance by the two leads, as well as the rest of the cast.

Plus the DVD includes some nice ""extras"" like good film segments on the ""Making of"" and ""Behind the scenes"". And a wonderful Collector's Booklet with saint bios, film commentary, study questions, color photos, etc.

Bottom line - this film version has it all and is a real cinematic and spiritual treasure. Get it!",1229558400,105,1405,4.866108786610878

3557019,5,B001EPKKUK,"The best and most historically accurate dramatization to date of the saints of Assisi. Well acted, especially the characterization of Francis.
Thoughtful and moving.  The writing and direction take special care to show how Francis and Clare progress from lives of privilege to lives of joyful poverty for God. The film gets better with repeated viewings, as subtle nuances may be missed if seen only once!",1226793600,44,405,5.136363636363637

3557021,2,B001EPKKUK,"It was boring. I also noticed they avoided mentioning pretty much any miracles. Perhaps the writers were skeptics or uncomfortable with the power of God. For example, Claire's sister was too heavy for them to lift when her uncle came to take her back. They also avoided the dream of the pope about Francis supporting the church. There was also when Francis walked on burning coals as part of his appeal to the Muslims for access to the holy land and when Francis kissed a leper that changed into Christ early into his conversion. The closest to a miracle the movie got in the first 2/3 was a ferocious 'wolf' (aka dog) that didn't attack Francis. I only watched like 2/3 of the movie before giving it away. It was boring and God, or at least his power working through Francis, is minimized in this movie. If it doesn't help my faith and isn't entertaining, why bother?",1489881600,,868,4.535031847133758

It sounded like whoever did the English voice track during the first hour of the film was bored and detached. A better editing job could have made a very mediocre film into an outstanding one. (3 1/2 hours is TOO long.) Sadly, the viewing experience was like reading the first draft of an essay written by a freshman concerned to emphasize the most interesting highlights and to ""cover the material.""

3557027,1,B001EPKKUK,"It's basically a pack of lies about the lives of two great Saints.  Don't watch this and think you will learn much of anything about St. Clare or St. Francis, sadly about the only truth in this movie is the names.  Most (not all) of the names of characters in the movie are names of people that actually lived.  Other than that the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that you get an idea of the joy that the love of God can put into the heart of a person focused on doing God's will, but it doesn't show that this joy existed with real suffering cheerfully offered to God for love of Him Who was crucified for love of us and in response to the Gospel message to Love God and Love Neighbor.
Both these Saints performed many miracles that had many witnesses.  Not one actual miracle was told about in this movie.  They have St. Francis encountering a wolf in the forest but do not show what happened with the Wolf of Gubbio.  None of the miraculous healings obtained of God by St. Francis prayers were mentioned either.  The whole account of the quarrel with his father and intervention of the Bishop of Assisi was falsified.
It was an overly long movie that wasn't worth watching.  I guess the best you can do is get the biography by St. Bonaventure of St. Francis or check out the writings of Thomas of Celano on St. Francis and St. Clare which include actual testimonies by people who knew them about them and the miracles they obtained by the power of God.  The performances of the actors and actresses were adequate and the cinematography good - too bad they didn't have a script that represented the truth of these two great Saints.",1452038400,2,1650,4.383606557377049

3557053,5,B001EPKKUK,"Wonderfully acted. So many wonderful scenes, from early life and childhood when Francis was a ""bad boy"" who only wanted to be a swordsman and a Knight. He was from a very wealthy noble family, how he met the virgin child Clare who was already a Saint (and remained so throughout her life). How Francis changed, and gave everything to the poor, including all of the clothes off his back. How he was rebellious yet followed Christ's teaching and lived the life of Christ. And eventually became very much like Him, even down to the Stigmata that he bore. And how he secretly inspired Clare, and when she could not have Francis as her love, then she gave herself completely to Christ. Very accurate historically, in every way. The locations, including the wars of the Crusades, and the miracle of Christ coming down off the Cross on Christmas night at midnight as a newborn Son, because He loved Clare so much that He wanted to let her hold Him. Which was eye witnessed and documented by many people there.",1389830400,,1002,4.603351955307263

3557056,4,B001EPKKUK,"First off use Italian language with english subtitles.  Italian actors seem to identify more the saints on a human level.  The movie was more factual then any on the market.  You can see the absolute spiritual growth and love between the two.  Though not all of it is accurate,(i.e. Francis getting out of jail so quickly, teen Francis holding out a doll to Clare as a child as her parents run out of Assisi), it is still believable.  Costumes, scene lay out, all well done.  I recommend it not only for entertainment but to witness the development of pure Godly love between a man and a woman.

3557061,5,B001EPKKUK,"Great DVD and film.
It's too bad this film is not mainstream as the film is overall high quality.
St. Francis and St. Clare were genuine in their love of Christ and were quite revolutionary for their time.
If befriending other cultures is controversial to some tightwads today, just imagine; Francis befriending cultures of different faiths was insane and lethal at his time, yet like Christ, he reached out. He became one of the most beloved Saints of all time representing what his pope assured him would not be the easiest path to follow.
I'm Catholic and this movie represents the imperfection and perfection of the members of the faith wonderfully as we are all human beings and imperfect after all. My favorite part was were they visit the Vatican for approval of their way of life. Despite the skeptical and rude treatment by the council, they humbly stayed true to their faith in the Lord.
If you feel spiritually empty due to humanity's imperfections, watching this film might just lift you up and remind that despite it all God's small gifts to us are more powerful than anything if we are willing to accept.",1379980800,,1118,4.7384615384615385

Historically it seems their contact with each other was extremely limited. But books and movies such as this continue to imagine that it could have been more than this, which does indeed increase the entertainment value. On the other hand this movie strangely eliminates most accounts of his many miracles. It also becomes quite tedious as it goes on and on.

But this is the best of them all.  It isn't perfect, and neither will it appeal to everyone.  However, as one who has been a franciscan devotee for most of his life, I give this two-part italian tv movie two thumbs up.

It lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes, approximately, and feels dragging at times.  That's the bad.

The good is much better.

Actors: Ettore Bassi is the best St. Francis yet.  His interpretation has more warmth and range than Dillman's, conveys ""jesterhood"" authentically without looking spaced out like Graham Faulkner, and is just simply more believable in his interactions with the poor than Mickey Rourke.  Mary Petruolo shows us many aspects of St. Claire, from an innocent youth to motherly abbess, without the audience having to suspend one's intellect too much.  Also, I was particularly impressed with her acting during the scene where Claire confronts her uncle.

History: One can divide this movie into two concurrent biographies: Claire and Francis.  Each biography (or should I say hagiography?) can be divided into stages, and each stage is close enough to traditional sources versions that I can safely call this film the most historically accurate.  Most movies talk about the Church of San Damiano, but this is the first one I know to mention Our Lady of the Angels.  Francis of Assisi mentions the Porziuncula once, that's it.  I don't recall Rivo Torto as being mentioned in the film but that is no big loss.

The pivotal scene where Francis renounces his inheritance is done well here.  It was omitted in Francis of Assisi, overdone in Brother Sun, and doesn't quite have the same ""mmph"" in Francesco.  His audience with the Pope is also done well, and I'm glad it was mentioned that ""radical poverty"" was also practiced by heretics of the time such as the cathari, but it was obedience that convinced the Pope to approve the Friars Minor.

Mood: When I think of the various St. Francis movies, I can always pinpoint what ""mood"" the producers are after.  Francis of Assisi wanted to present him as a holy man.  Francesco as a radical, and Brother Sun Sister Moon as a hippie.  Claire and Francis, to me, presents a balanced view.  He is also presented as ever obedient to the Church, something lacking in many presentations of the character.
I especially love that first line that Francis says to a young Clare, ""Go and don't look back""  It sets the tone of the whole film as going through one's path and never looking back.

Another reviewer commented that miracles were not shown in this movie.  If you think about it, miracles are never the selling point of Saint Francis movies, but this one did show several which I won't spoil for readers.  I therefore beg to disagree with the statement about lack of miracles.  But miracles are not the point of St. Francis' life - it's his life and how his had changed others.  This was perfectly seen here with Clare.  At the same time, one does not get the feeling that Francis dominates Clare.  She is her own person.

If you must watch one Saint Francis movie, watch this one.  I used to say that about Francis of Assisi, but Clare and Francis surpasses it greatly.",1292198400,31,3762,5.431034482758621
3557091,5,B001EPKKUK,"This movie is so much better than ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"". which portrayed Saint Francis as some kind of mental case.  In Clare and Francis, both of these beloved saints are portrayed as normal people to whom we can relate, and at the same time, be inspired by their devotion and faith.  Great cinematography and the acting is good too.  A well -made movie.",1292198400,3,360,4.59375

3557094,5,B001EPKKUK,"After being disappointed by several other films on St. Francis, most notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-Sun-Sister-Moon/dp/B00015HX9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother Sun, Sister Moon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Francis-of-Assisi/dp/B0006GANY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Francis of Assisi</a>, I found this film to be refreshingly authentic. It portrays both the bold, revolutionary spirit for which Francis and Clare are so famous, while also emphasizing their humility and sincere love for Christ and the Church.

What I really loved about this film is the way it portrayed Francis and Clare's discernment of God's call in their lives. Having seen the examples of subsequent religious congregations (especially Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity), we can easily forget how unusual it was for Francis and Clare to want to live as poor servants among the poor, rather than enter a ""respectable,"" established congregation.

A few disclaimers: the dubbing can sound a bit cheesy sometimes, and the dialogue does not exactly ""match up"" to the actors' speech, even in the original Italian. Also, I do wish the film would have included more about the end of Clare's life... but those are my only complaints!

Highly recommended. Anyone interested in learning more about Francis and Clare will not be disappointed.",1278288000,10,1437,6.513089005235602
3557095,1,B001EPKKUK,"This movie would have been condemned by the Church 50 years ago! If your a person who embraces this new religion, thinks that everyone is going to Heaven, and that Pope John Paul II is a saint for kissing the Koran then this movie is for you!

St. Francis never would have called the Koran holy! And maybe the makers of this film are freemasons who's God is Lucifer is that why we don't see the miracles performed by St. Francis? The freemasons are the ones who formed Vatican II and after it the church no longer condemns the Masons. Vatican II also did away with the prayer to St. Michael after each mass (which we desperately need)!

Let us pray as it says in HOLY scripture that God will send forth his messenger to purify the priesthood so that their sacrifices will be pleasing as in days past ( Before 1969 all around the world there were altars in our churches and there was a sacrifice, but now with the help of the freemasonic Jews and protestants, there are tables) A few bishops condemned this council, one main reason was that Pope Pius V canonized the mass saying that it could never change! Vatican II was not like vatican I it was only a pastorial council not dogmatic!

I believe all these nuns in the movie could have been just as pretty in real life but did they have to use all that makeup?",1270252800,22,1310,4.338775510204082
3557096,4,B001EPKKUK,"I've always been something of a fan of many of the saints, and one of my favorites was Francis of Assisi; who not only accomplished a great many fantastic things in his life, by following the will of God, but received a visible stigmata, and worked numerous miracles through prayer, and faith in God.

Of all the people in human history, I think that there have been maybe two dozen who've seen as many miracles as Saint Francis, yet this movie depicts only a couple of them.

In some ways, this is a good thing, because it allows the story to be approached from a new perspective; the perspective of Clare herself.  The majority of the movie focuses on Clare; her hurtles and motivations in the path she chooses, and includes Francis only in instances where you need to know about him to really understand what Clare did.  It's certainly different from the usual approach, and given the approach that it takes, it does remarkably well.

The story is involving, moving, and really brings out the characters of Francis and Clare, as people, struggling to do God's work in a world where their self-imposed poverty is seen as a mockery to their friends and family; to the rich and poor alike.  It's a fantastic story about faith, and a beautiful tale in more ways than one.

However, there's also a problem with this type of approach; in that by focusing on the lives of Clare and Francis, and what kind of people they were, the focus is somewhat drawn away from the one person who was the true star in the life of every saint.

Miracles are not neccesary in order to make a religious movie good.  I think Pope John XXIII proved that rather handily.  However, as I watch this movie, I couldn't help but wonder why the works of God in the life of Francis were being largely downplayed and ignored.

The stigmata is shown in one scene, just before Francis' death, and there's a scene with a wolf, and one with the baby Jesus, but that's all.  The life of Saint Francis was full of supernatural events, communication with the lord, visions, healings, and animals who listened to him preach when no one else would.  In my mind, these things are inseparable from Francis of Assisi, and they helped to define just how special his choices were, and more to the point, how special God really was.

There's a danger there, of surrendering to skepticism.  It seems the words ""superstition"" and ""supernatural"" are often confused with one another, to the point where depictions of the supernatural can be avoided, even in religious films; a mistake that Padre Pio, for example, didn't make.

Still, this is a quality movie about Saint Claire, and her view of the faith of Francis.  I found it very encouraging, and very good.  If, like myself, you can find faith and good deeds inspiring, then you'll probably enjoy it too.  Just don't watch it if you're expecting to be dazzled.  There are other movies for that sort of thing.",1265241600,11,2912,4.6065891472868215

Beautiful photography, appropriate musical background, and vivid imagary of the times in which Francis lived added to the message.
It is obedience and humility that reforms and renews the Church, and continues to do so.
