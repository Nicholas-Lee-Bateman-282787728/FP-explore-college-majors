7970007,1,B00006JDTL,"I saw this on Netflix Instant Watch today.  It's not even worth the airtime on your computer, much less going out of your way to spend money on a physical DVD.  I don't know about the DVD version, but the streaming version had no narration, no explanation, and no credits even.  It was like someone cobbled together a bunch of old bloopers and threw them onto DVD format.  I've seen better blooper collections on Youtube.

The bloopers themselves weren't bad, but I wouldn't pay for them.",1265500800,2,488,4.627906976744186
7970008,1,B00006JDTL,"Not only it's NOT funny OR ""Sexy"". The quality is horrible. You literally can't even see most of the video. I'm not kidding. They used the same un-remastered footage they found rotting under some desk in Hollywood.

Skip this piece of cr(Beep!)p.",1197504000,,246,4.857142857142857
7970009,1,B00006JDTL,"First of all, the video quality on this disc is so awful, it's hard to appreciate any of the clips.  Furthermore, there is very little clever or funny about these clips.  A succession of unrelated clips which all end in ""God d*** it"" or ""Son of a b****"" - wow - what genius.....

Sometimes blooper reels can be more entertaining than the released version.  This is not one of those times.  Do yourself a favor and pick something else.",1145491200,8,434,4.443037974683544
7970010,4,B00006JDTL,"Up to now, I have never had too many kind words to say about Passport Video, but the company did a good job on this DVD.

Don't expect anything better than fuzzy picture quality; however, this collection of bloopers is rare--I have never seen some of them (and I thought I'd seen them all). Many are laugh-out-loud hilarious (Abbot and Costello, for example), and it's refreshing to see that '50s off-color humor was as real and human back then as it is today.

The artwork on the cover is deceptive; this collection is mostly bloopers from the '40s through the '70s, including those from MASH, Laugh-In, Carol Burnett, and earlier movies. Only the Soupy Sales skit shows female nudity (and it was nice to see the skit without the censors covering all the naughty bits).

The DVD menu works flawlessly and is nicely laid out. The DVD is 65 minutes long...not long enough for me, but the price makes it a steal.

The watermark (PIP) in the lower corner is tamer than most, and (thankfully) exists only in the beginning of the ""movie"". It is absent most of the time.

Very recommended.",1113523200,18,1083,4.619791666666667
