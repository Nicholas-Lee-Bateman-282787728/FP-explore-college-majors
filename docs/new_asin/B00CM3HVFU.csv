5726332,3,B00CM3HVFU,"I have watched this film twice. I enjoyed this more watching it a second time. The acting was believable, especially the young child who was the daughter of the main couple in the picture. I think the actress,s name is Renee Sly.",1377302400,,229,4.476190476190476
5726333,1,B00CM3HVFU,"This movie is about a motionless subway car where a dozen people are trapped in after an explosion.  Maybe the bomber is among them ?  Very weak ploy. Maybe the bad guy is the young dude who looks arabic? wait, maybe its the islamic black woman, or maybe its the white male in his 50s, or the spanish speaking unemployed nurse, or the family vacationing, etc...etc... Quite boring story.  Then, there is another bomb in the train ready to explode, and we never really understand why the bomber wants to kill everybody.  A poor movie.",1376870400,2,533,4.578947368421052
5726334,3,B00CM3HVFU,"The film opens up with a quick 5 second look at a group of passengers on a subway. It evolves to a 10 second look, then the explosion. A group of injured, dead, and non-injured people are trapped. They find a second bomb device with a timer and deduce one of them is the bomber.

The film is partially about stereotypes, although I didn't feel it. With the lack of action, the film should have been about character, but these were people we didn't know much about to begin with. I will say that the acting was fairly decent. The plot and directing etc. was okay except there wasn't any theme to the film, no hook to grab me.  A good film, but not exciting.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1375488000,,701,4.295454545454546
5726335,5,B00CM3HVFU,"While most Christian films are low budget and show it, Red Line has great special effects, actors and is quite the thrill ride.  Unlike other Christian films, this movie is not preachy or tacky.  While it does praise virtue, the message it's trying to share is the insecurity of today's subway systems.  Red Line is about a terrorist attack on a subway that blasts apart a train taking many lives in the explosion and impact.  The survivors are left to fend for themselves and doubt each other's intentions when they realize that the bomber is among them.  I'd say more but I don't want to spoil anything.  This is a movie you have to experience for yourself.",1375401600,,659,4.589743589743589
5726336,4,B00CM3HVFU,I was pleasantly surprised to see a movie that had a strong ensemble cast and not beat the viewers over the head with special effects. My family enjoyed the film and I would recommend it.,1373846400,2,187,4.371428571428571
5726337,5,B00CM3HVFU,"My family was on the edge of our seats during the entire film! This movie was very clever and appropriate for families; I hesitated to let my 8 year old daughter watch the movie but there wasn't anything in this movie that was inappropriate for her which is rare these days in movies.  This movie doesn't have the extra special effects, etc. but who cares finally a great movie, with a great story!  I decided to write this review when we watched the ending and saw the commentary which showed this movie was made by college students as a project which was even more impressive!!!",1373673600,7,580,4.514285714285714
5726338,5,B00CM3HVFU,Red Line was a great movie. Very entertaining! I would recommend this movie to others! Each character has an interesting story to tell.,1373500800,3,135,4.913043478260869
5726339,3,B00CM3HVFU,"""Red Line,"" according to the bonus ""making of"" feature and online sources, is the collaboration of professional filmmakers and ""Catholic college students from San Diego's tiny John Paul the Great University.""  They did a good job; it's an entirely professional-looking production with a tight script, above-average genre-movie acting, and moments of taut suspense.  Nicole Gale Anderson and John Billingsley do highly creditable work in the key leads, and the movie touches on issues of terrorism, torture, regret, courage, and...virtue.  Back to that in a second.

Where I found the movie weak was in the motivation of the bomber.  To say more would be to spoil some cool twists, but suffice to say that for a plan that heinous, a more specific kind of motivation seems necessary.  The movie doesn't have to stop while the baddie reads a manifesto, but I need to have some basic level of understanding why people do what they do, in order to care about what they're doing fully.  There was a nod in that direction, but it was anemic.

And back to ""virtue"": While it was never heavy-handed, at some point in the movie, I realized that there was a faintly religious agenda at work.  Nothing preachy, nothing manipulative.  In some ways, this is refreshing--and there is much in Catholicism at its best that is completely compatible with my own humanistic leanings (give or take contraception and a few other issues).  But it was not seamless, and it lead to a last scene, last line, that was an unnecessary groaner, and felt to me tacked on just to give it a sort of religious imprimatur.  It hardly detracted from the overall success of the storytelling and production.  But it was not needed and felt forced.",1373414400,3,1709,4.8517241379310345

8583249,3,B00CM3HVFU,"This film succeeds as an indie title from an up and coming film school, and I truly believe enjoyment can be had with this film. It kept me engaged and the more intense scenes were really well done, even if the film surrounding them felt a little weak. By no means is it perfect, but it hits just enough right notes to leave the audience feeling satisfied, and is definitely better than what it could have been.",1497139200,,411,4.35064935064935

8583253,3,B00CM3HVFU,"A bomb goes off in an LA subway, and the survivors try to keep it together, care for the injured, and find a way out, all the while wondering who--if any--amongst them is the terrorist.

For a very low budget film that some college students and faculty made as a project--something I didn't realize until after I'd seen it--REDLINE is quite good. All the same, the acting by just about everyone is dry-tepid, and most of the lines sound read rather than said. Plot-wise, it pretty much follows the formula, with the sort of twists that are meant to be surprising but are well-trodden to the point of being quite predictable. Who/who doesn't survive is another predictable factor.

The notes at the beginning of the film cite some statistics about domestic terrorism that seem to promise the film will have a broader scope than it actually does. Partly by necessity, I suppose, the view is quite limited and claustrophobic. Some brief shots of the outside world--rescue efforts, news flashes, etc--during the course of the film would have been a big plus, but I can see how they didn't have the resources for that. More solid clues as to the motivations of the culprit would also have helped.

Oh, well. REDLINE is a decent thriller if you like this sort of thing and aren't too demanding.",1390089600,,1288,4.7155555555555555
8583254,4,B00CM3HVFU,"For a cast of mostly unknowns, this was a very nice exercise in suspense and tension, though the villain's motives are not totally clear.  Decent effects and good use of a closed space.",1387843200,,185,4.606060606060606
8583255,4,B00CM3HVFU,"Watched this movie because my daughter's college was involved in the production. I expected a ""student-quality"" film, nothing more. Instead I found myself totally immersed in the film and found that the plot kept driving me toward fist-clenching worry. In the end, I felt it was a good movie that I'd enjoy watching again.

There are movies that will scare you more. There are movies that will have bigger, better special effects. But this is a movie that will pull you in and have you pulling for characters you care about.

A few comments referencing other reviews:
- I don't think I'd let an 8-year old watch this movie. There was a bit too much blood in in, and a 10-year old faced with some tough stuff.
- I, too, wished for a better explanation for the bombing. While the explanation is given, it didn't make complete sense. Then again, I thought, if someone is insane enough to commit insane violence, would I expect that person to make sense? Timothy McVeigh never did. John Lennon's killer didn't either.
- I agree that this movie had some lessons to teach, and I thought those lessons were presented well. It's good to see a lead character with some moral fortitude. It's also good to see people fail morally, realize they've done so, and resolve to be better in the future.

In other words, don't expect a blockbuster, but expect to enjoy this film.",1378684800,2,1360,4.634854771784233
8583256,3,B00CM3HVFU,"""Red line"" was a fair movie. Not great but watchable.

Special effects were okay. Acting was above par across the board. The lead actress was young and beautiful besides being a good actress. The villain was dastardly. The other actors did a good job. The movie ended up being as much a character study as an action film, with a strong look at stereotyping.

My negatives: There never was an explanation of the bombing. It would have helped to know ""why.""

Also, there is no subtitling on this film.  I am partially deaf and really need English subtitles and this movie was hard to understand in spots.",1378166400,4,602,4.598130841121495
