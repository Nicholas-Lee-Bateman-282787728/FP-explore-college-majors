8166974,4,B000M7Z21S,"Two movies that I love but this 2 on 1 DVD looks like it was bootleg filmed with a hand held camera in some remote theater. The filming is so bad it's almost funny. But to have these 2 movies on 1 DVD is great. So, poor quality but cool movies. For me it's great. If you want high resolution definition quality don't get this!",1431388800,,326,4.030769230769231
