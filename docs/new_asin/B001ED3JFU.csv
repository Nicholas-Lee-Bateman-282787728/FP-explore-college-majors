3549742,5,B001ED3JFU,"Bobby and Jimmy are two eagle scouts who, through acts of bravery, win trips to South America to visit fellow scouts there. So how do they get there? Aboard Mr. Mac's little bi-plane in which they have to share a cramped cockpit seat while encountering a fierce storm and then running out of gas  until they crash in the Amazon jungle. Mr. Mac has a bad foot sprain and Bobby and Jimmy set out for help. The serial follows our two heroes and their stowaway dog ""Johnson"" as they battle natives, bandits, wild animals and the elements while Mr. Mac contracts a fever and stumbles around aimlessly for most of the remaining chapters.
This serial was lots of fun to watch especially since the main leads are two rather ordinary kids. Bobby (Bobby Cox, not the Atlanta Braves manager) is a chubby little tyke who always wants to eat but is very smart and can get out of any jam, and Jim (Jim Vance) is a tall skinny kid who is likewise with the smarts, and the two make a great team whether foiling a native sacrifice or blowing up a bandit hideout.
I have both available editions of this serial and I will say that the re-mastered version is generally cleaner, however the version offered by ALPHA isn't too bad either. Both have alot of the same flaws, contrast issues most noticible. I sometimes alternated dvds for chapter comparison and forgot which one I was watching. So I would say you can purchase either and enjoy it, though I would recommend the 2-disc restored version if you don't mind spending the extra bucks.",1268524800,4,1520,4.547445255474453

8297753,1,B001ED3JFU,"This serial is a mess.

The serial looks like it was converted from a used VHS tape to digital.  Not that this would rate one star if the movie was interesting and fun to watch, but this one wasn't, it just made a poor movie unwatchable.

The plot is sub-par, the acting sub-par, and the story line sub-par.  The lead looks like Spanky McFarland from the 'Our Gang"" movies, which is really convenient due to the fact this movie is a mash of ""Our Gang"". ""Jungle Jim"".and ""Bomba"", and that isn't even fair to the mentioned films because they are fun to watch, this one isn't.

Save your money and your time.  If you must watch a Boy Scout movie, stick with Clifton Webb's ""The Scoutmaster;"" Disney's ""Follow Me Boys,"" and the indy ""Scout Camp.""  And if you need to read about scouts I recommend Kindles collection of ""The Boy Scout Megapack"" by Herbert Carter  Twelve stories featuring the Silver Beaver patrol presented in a series, combined into twelve books.  All superior stories compared to this and fun to read.",1472860800,,1015,4.594444444444444

8297757,5,B001ED3JFU,"This DVD series deserves Archive Status.  At first, this series could only be viewed at a Movie Theatre during a Matinee in the 1930s.
In addition, the actor Carter Dixon, and the boy actors Bobby Cox and Jim Vance were natural without a lot of Hollywood fluff.  A young boy could not to a Narnia where Boy Scouts were on adventures in Central America which involved treasure-hunters, dangerous beasts and savage natives.  Iron Eyes Cody's acting debut as a native was interesting.  When I was a young Boy Scout in the 1950s, living in New York, I remember watching this series in TV reruns.  Most noteworthy was how the boys put their scouting skills to the ultimate test to survive.  This is a movie series for the young to benefit and a good Archive item in a DVD Collection.",1412640000,,778,4.561151079136691

The scouts love to sit and watch the series.  Just recently gave them a taste of the first two chapters and they left the meeting wanting more.  Use it as a reward, a lesson or just plain fun.

We laughed hysterically because so much of it is sooo non-realistic and the situations are nothing our current Boy Scouts would/could ever get theirselves into.  But, watching it in the context of pure entertainment and not a Scout lesson, then I'll give it 4 stars.",1284249600,5,402,4.405405405405405
