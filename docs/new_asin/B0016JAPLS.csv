A car drives into Bridgeport Calif and stops. The driver asks about the owner of Bailey's Garage. Joe Stefanos tells Jeff somebody wants to see him at Lake Tahoe. Jeff used to be a private detective in the Big City, he was asked to find a runaway girlfriend. He tracks Kathie Moffit to Acapulco Mexico and finds her. The film tells what happened there. Jeff falls in love with Kathie and they plan to leave. But Whit shows up with Joe. Jeff puts them off, then leaves with Kathie for San Francisco. But Jeff's old partner finds them. Kathie shows her hidden personality, and Jeff finds her bankbook! They separate.

When Jeff visits Whit he finds Kathie has returned. Whit wants Jeff to do a job for him in San Francisco. Jeff will retrieve the papers from a person (but worries if it is a frame). The plot grows more complex. Jeff senses the trap and foils the plot. But something happens to upset Bailey's scheme. Jeff manages to escape his pursuers and turn the tables. Will he be cleared of the frame and collect his payment? More complexities arise in a surprising ending. The ending is happy for the survivors.

The violence in this action story is mostly off-screen. It is a good story but not a great story about the worst villainess since ""The Maltese Falcon"".",1412208000,,1317,4.525210084033613
