Match 4)Chris Jericho vs. Edge
Match 5)Bra and Panties match Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Kiebler
Match 6)Triple Threat match for the WWE Title (c)The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar vs. Triple H
Not many matches but here are the results with a small review:
Match 1)Kiss my A** match: Rikishi def. Rico
Very Short!!! The only thing that was exciting was the samoan drop by Rikishi when Rico missed the moonsault. Because of the celebration I'll give it **
Match 2)Cruiserweight Champion Jamie Nobel def. Hurricane
A good Cruiserweight match! A cheap ending but the rest of the match was great! Not too long but definatly not too short! ****
Match 3)Tag Team Champions Christian & Lance Storm def. Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman
Another great match! It was long and highflying!  Exciting, but still another cheap ending. It had the perfect timing and the perfect match! **** 1/2
Match 4)Edge def. Chris Jericho
The 2nd best match on the card! Very Long from Jerichgo taking 5 minutes to get to tye ring! Another good role up ending and Jericho throws a sissy fit after the match! CRYBABY! *****
Match 5)Bra and panties match Torrie Wilson derf. Stacy Kiebler
Well..... at least thy did a lue thez press. The bra and panties was just a gimmick to entertain. *
Match 6)Triple Threat match for the WWE Title:WWE Champion The Rock def. Brock Lesnar and Triple H
GREAT GREAT GREAT MATCH!!! These  three men sure know how to put on a fight! Still, no new champions. Great ending, great moves, and great timing! That's all I need to say *****
It was an average ppv but I think it is pretty cool that this is the first time in 18 years that the wwe has came to Melbourne.
GOOD PAY PER VIEW!",1068163200,3,1923,4.636363636363637
1794424,2,B00006SFPD,"Rikishi VS Rico - This was a nothing match.  Rico has quite a bit of talent, but it has been quite some time since I've seen Rikishi in a good match.  Since the stipulation for this match was that the loser had to kiss the rear end of the winner, you can guess how this one ended.
Cruiserweight Championship : Jamie Noble (C) VS The  Hurricane - This match wasn't too bad.  Hurricane hit a swinging neckbreaker off the top rope (impressive), and while it wasn't as high flying as I might expect from the cruiserweights, it wasn't a bad match.  It also wasn't any different than what we see on Smackdown every Thursday.  This was early in the rivalry between these two.
Tag Team Championship: The UnAmericans (Lance Storm and Christian) (C) VS Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio - This match gave the feel of being thrown together at the last minute.  The UnAmericans had already jumped to RAW and we had never seen Kidman and Mysterio team up.  Considering the talent of the champions and how exciting Mysterio is.....this match was boring.
Chris Jericho VS Edge - The best match on the card.  I'm a big fan of Jericho as it is, and he plays to the opponent and the crowd so well.  Good match.

Bra and Panties: Stacy Keibler VS Torrie Wilson - Is this wrestling or a watered down Girls Gone Wild?  I don't know, but if the WWE expects us to take the women's division seriously, they have to stop making the women a joke.  As it stands, I'm a wrestling fan and would rather see actual wrestling matches when I watch the programming.  The Big Valbowski introduces the women (the most entertaining part) and Nidia gets involved.  Nobody cares.
Undisputed Championship: Rock (C) VS Triple H VS Brock Lesnar - Remember that this is before Summerslam, so Brock had not yet won the title nor had he faced Rock (as far as I can remember).  This match was somewhat of a letdown.  The Rock worked really hard, but the match was somewhat uninspired.  I wonder if this is because we know who will win (as if they are going to change the main event two weeks before Summerslam) or just because the Triple Threat match was just a mess.
Bonus Matches from 1986 (the last time the WWE came to Australia
The Rougeaus Vs The Moondogs - The commentary for this match said that it was the WWF debut of the Rougeaus (later known as the Fabulous Rougeau Brothers).  While I was always entertained by the Rougeaus when I watched in the 80's, this match didn't have anything special.  Maybe it was the Moondogs that killed the match.
Don Muraco & Mr Fuji Vs S.D Jones & King Tonga - I honestly skipped this one.  I've only seen Muraco wrestle Dino Bravo in 1988, but I didn't care enough to watch it.  It was sad to see Mr. Fuji in the ring.  He was fairly old at the time and should have realized that his time in the ring was done.
Andre the Giant VS Big John Studd - Always nice to see Andre in the ring, but this was a lumbering match.  Slow, boring, and the only reason you should watch it is just to see Andre wrestle.
Honestly, this DVD is not worth your money.  Had this been a Smackdown show, it might not have been too bad.  However, this was a PPV.  This wasn't a good PPV at all.  The matches weren't very interesting and there was nothing else to help move it along.  No promos, nothing.  If you have to own every WWE DVD, then buy it.  If you only want the good ones, leave this one alone.",1049414400,7,3375,4.326433121019108
1794425,3,B00006SFPD,"Basicly as most of the other reviewers have stated the event was nowhere near as great as it could have being, especially considering the talent that was present. None of the matches where truely outstanding and the DVD treatment is not really on par with most of the other WWE DVD's.
That said, I still purchased this DVD purely because I was there and it means so much more to us Australian fans as we had the Rock, HHH, Rey and many other superstars putting a show on for us which we would not otherwise see live. In fact wrestling fans broke the attendance record at the stadium it was held.
I remember Stephanie coming down the ramp and warmly kick starting the event and the dancing she done with Rikishi, she is my favourite Diva and very close to my seat.
I guess you had to be there to appreciate this DVD, it meant the world to Australian fans like me who were at the biggest WWE event they had ever had the chance to go to, but for everyone else this is only a second rate DVD.",1039305600,3,988,4.232804232804233
1794426,1,B00006SFPD,"After seeing this DVD, all I could say was ""Thank God I didn't spend [$$$] to see this garbage"" [though my language was more creative].
Really. It's that bad.
Every single match is awful. Here's a rundown:
Rock v. Triple H v. Brock Lesnar - terrible, boring match. And the special feature showing HHH and Rock beating up Paul Heymann is just as dull.
Bra and Panties match - I'm a female, so need I get into it? No? Alrighty.
Jericho v. Edge - Best match on the entire thing, though not for the match itself. Jericho's interaction with the crowd was gold.
Tag Team - Follows the very basic tag formula. I defy anyone to find a person that cares about Billy Kidman.
Noble v. Hurricane - I feel bad for these guys. They can wrestle their hearts out and it won't make a difference, simply because they're gimmicks aren't very compelling.
Rikishi v. Rico - I skipped it.
The WWE also insults the intelligence of the viewer by having Cole and Taz refer to themselves as being ""at ringside"" and ""in Australia"" when they 1) are clearly not anywhere near ringside and 2) in the States, as Taz frequently gives away.
The 3 ""classic"" [!!!???] matches are appallingly bad. Honestly, just because a match is old, doesn't mean it's a classic.
There are plenty of WWE DVD's worth your money. This, however, is not one of them.",1038700800,3,1312,4.493723849372385
1794427,1,B00006SFPD,the global warning dvd was very boring. they even left out some of the matches that actually happenened at the event itself.plus all of the wrestlers performeed horribly.i thought this would be good but it was really bad.overall do nat buy on dvd or vhs the global warning 2002!,1038355200,,278,4.6938775510204085
1794428,4,B00006SFPD,"56, 000 + witnessed this show, held at Melbourne's Colonial Stadium on August 10 this year. I was one of those in attendance for the WWE's first show down under for nearly 20 years, and I can say that it was an exciting, if a little bit predictable, night of wrestling. There were some good matches on the card, specifically the Cruiserweight title match between the Hurricane and Jamie Noble, the Tag Title match with Rey Mysterio and Kidman taking on Lance Storm and Christian of the Un-Americans, Kurt Angle (playing the face, funnily enough) against Test, Chris Jericho vs. fellow Canadian Edge and the main event with the Undisputed Title on the line, which saw The Rock defend against Brock Lesnar and Triple H in an exciting match. I am led to believe there will be extras on the DVD, with footage of the WWE superstars touring throughout Melbourne. Don't watch it for the best card of wrestling but it will still be an enjoyable viewing.",1034553600,4,945,4.664670658682635
7973276,4,B00006SFPD,"Global Warning was I believe, the first and only WWE ""PPV"" (I use that term loosely) to take place in Australia and exclusive on PPV to Australia. It was WWE's first visit to Australia since the 80s, so similar to how they gave the UK Insurrextion and Rebellion, they gave Australia Global Warning. While it was treated with the atmosphere of a PPV, the show was nothing more than a taped house show to say the least",1504224000,,416,4.415584415584416

7973284,4,B00006SFPD,"This tour marked the first time WWE visited the country of Austraila in close to 20 years and this was one of the shows on that tour that mixed the RAW & SmackDown athletes together for a good card.  Keep in mind that this WAS NOT a PPV or a card ment for television, it was a normal house show with the catch that it was in Austraila who didn't have a house show in almost 20 years unlike other counties like the U.S. & Canada.  Also on here inbetween the matches were footage of the WWE superstars thoughout Australia such as Torrie Wilson shopping, Kurt Angle visiting the zoo, and Jamie Noble & Nidia surfing.

Kiss My Ass Match: Rikishi vs. Rico - Just an average opener here that got the crowd warmed up & involved a little humorous site with Rico's reaction to the stinkface.

Crusierweight Champion Jamie Noble vs. The Hurricane - Good crusierweight action that had some high flyin', mat wrestling, and given enough time to develop into a good match up.  One of the better crusierweight matches during this year.

Tag Team Champions Un-Americans vs. Billy Kidman & Rey Mysterio - Kidman & Mysterio knew each other so well here that they actually meshed well here into a good team & held their own against Storm & Christian here in a match that was highly better than expected knowing that Kidman & Mysterio were not a regular tag team.

Edge vs. Chris Jericho - Two of the best ""young talent"" in WWE at this time clashed in what was a great match with Jericho doing a funny promo before the match as well.  This was one of the best matches of the night as they give you their all & told a nice story here as well.

Bra & Panties Match: Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler - The T&A (and ""L"" for legs whenever it includes Ms. Keibler) segment of the night.  There isn't really much more to stay besides the fact that this match was actually decent & watchable.

WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar vs. Triple H - This was Triple H's first match back since taking some time off for an injury after King Of The Ring earlier in the year.  What a match here & was the match of the night here.  They meshed well together concidering the facts that I believe this was the only time Brock & Triple H wrestled against each other and the only other time besides SummerSlam that I believe Rock & Brock fought each other.  There was never a boring moment here & Brock didn't look out of place once between these two veterans.  The only disappointment is that you knew who was going to win the match (this happened right before SummerSlam) but it still doesn't take away from a good triple threat match.

Overall, this was a good event in my eyes.  It wasn't suppost to be a PPV or television, it was a basically a house show they put on DVD so if your looking for storylines & high profile fueds then this won't appeal to you but if your looking for just good wrestling action then I recommend.",1182038400,5,2900,4.35064935064935
