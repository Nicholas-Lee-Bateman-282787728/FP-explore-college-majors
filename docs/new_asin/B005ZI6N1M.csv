BUT IT WAS OK TO WATCH...",1365292800,,125,4.25
4910636,4,B005ZI6N1M,I watched the DVD with a group of 6 people and we all enjoyed the short stories.  I recommend this DVD.,1358726400,3,103,3.9047619047619047
4910637,5,B005ZI6N1M,"I really liked this collection of shorts. They are all interesting and well put together. The stories keep your interest and make you watch 'til the end. The only thing I'd have to complain about is in the short ""Spring"". Some of the camera shots look jittery. At first I thought it was the DVD itself but no, it's the way it was filmed or transferred to DVD. The rest of the shorts are perfect.",1353801600,4,395,4.28
4910638,4,B005ZI6N1M,"I am a huge fan of Guesthouse Films- I own all the movies they have put out so far, I was not sure about buying several ""short"" films on one DVD but thought I'd give it a try because Rob Williams & Rodney Johnson have a way of selecting films that are spot on. I watched it on valentine's day because I am bitter today. Each of the short films (except for one,""winner takes all"" but this is my opinion only, you may like them all) left me wanting to see a feature film made of each. Kudo's Guesthouse Films for another great selection!",1329177600,10,535,4.153846153846154

8489705,2,B005ZI6N1M,It's horrible thing that have nothing to do with the LGBT community .,1497744000,,69,4.384615384615385
8489706,3,B005ZI6N1M,"Interesting. but could have done without some of the violent acts, including a rape.",1482883200,,84,5.071428571428571
8489707,3,B005ZI6N1M,"Enjoyed ""Communication"". ""Spring"" was confronting, as was ""Winner takes All"" with the latter having a good finish. The other three were satisfactory , the best being ""Remission"".  Doesn't compare to Green Briefs.",1441065600,,212,5.625
8489708,2,B005ZI6N1M,Have seen better shorts than this  collection.,1436659200,,46,5.571428571428571
8489709,5,B005ZI6N1M,A weird but true story about what can happen.,1424304000,,45,4.111111111111111
8489710,3,B005ZI6N1M,not that good,1417910400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8489711,3,B005ZI6N1M,"These types of films all short story collections but with a common theme running through them are very difficult to rate, some may be good, some are alright, some bad.  Here goes #1..""Spring"" a young guy meets an older guy and go back to his place for some S & M play, can't really handle it and wants out ass he leaves he is smiling???? Huh! (not very interesting). #2..""Remission"" simply dull, boring and pointless. #3....""Winner Takes All"" a very beautiful young man brings together the 2 men he is seeing (and his slave?) to have the 2 of them fight for him, winner gets him. One is a muscular ex-boxer and the other a frail artist, what do YOU think. I liked this one, Ernesto is a find. #4...""Promise"" 2 men about to be married, one cheats and his partner finds out, the other does something horrible to the cheater, ending? but Iliked this one, too. #5..""Video Night""...just dumb and WHY??. #6...""Communication""...didn't get it, I was confused, did something happen between them or not?  So I liked 2 of 6...sorry this was so long.",1394668800,3,1038,4.605405405405405
8489712,5,B005ZI6N1M,Yes this film series rocks I'd say get all the colors that come with this series green is my favorite but I like them all very much.,1394323200,,132,3.925925925925926
8489713,1,B005ZI6N1M,A good idea gone bad.  Don't was your time or your money! Blah! Blah! Blah! Blah! 4 more words required to make a review. .BLAH!,1367366400,,128,4.12
