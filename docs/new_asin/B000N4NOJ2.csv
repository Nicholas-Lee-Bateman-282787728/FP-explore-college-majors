2755670,1,B000N4NOJ2,"I agree with Shaen Oneal's review. This product is full of wierd mistakes:  misnamed and out of order episodes abound.  One disc of mine had the episodes listed in Russian maybe?  Not sure.  Mine was a Japanese product, so Japanese titles--okay.  But Russian with no English option?  Not so helpful.  Also, I had at least two discs that would not play past a certain point in an episode.  I returned my set.  For the true charmed fan (who can pay the price) I would say only the full editions will satisfy.  I await mine eagerly.  Too bad we don't have the beautiful treasure chest option like the brits.",1192147200,7,604,4.5
2755671,4,B000N4NOJ2,"I had heard that the series was supposed to finish with Season 7, then at the last minute, it was decided to push forward with an eighth season. This most likely explains this box set. It might have some minor flaws, but is sure alot cheaper than buying each set seperately. I recommend it!! (You can also buy a Seasons 1-8 box set now, too, by the way). This was a great show, and I personally like having (most) of it together in one set...",1187913600,,442,4.211764705882353
2755672,2,B000N4NOJ2,"While watching the first 17 dvd's I noticed there were a few episodes that were missing pieces, part of the story.  Like they left out a section between commercial breaks.  Then on disc 18 the final episode with Prue...her death scene is missing.  A pretty pivitol part not to be included.  Currently working with vendor to determine what happened.  Good luck..be careful if you are a true charmed fan!",1184630400,4,402,4.768115942028985
2755673,4,B000N4NOJ2,"I'm happy to buy season 8 since I saved about $100 off the cost of this thing. My comment is not about what could have been done if they had waited, it's about other things that are wrong. There are no scene selections, which is not that bad a missing feature since each chapter covers the area between commercials. This is the case on most of the DVDs, but since every season was done by a different publisher some of the chapters do not correspond to natural breaks. On the first 12 or so discs I only ran across some minor inaccuracies in the subititles not matching the words spoken. On several discs after that however, someone really fell down on the job. The episode titles are out of order (they are even messed up across the discs some from one disc have titles from the previous one and vice versa) and the episodes themselves do not correspond to the order of the titles and to make it worse the episodes on a DVD are out of order in some cases. You'd think the producers of this set would have verified the contents of their product before sending it out into the world, even if it is about 115 hours in total. Even with the minor problems, I highly recommend this set for the true Charmed fan.",1181260800,13,1206,4.317180616740088
2755674,2,B000N4NOJ2,"Why would they do seasons 1-7 and not the Complete Series?  This is a little odd.  The packaging could use some work, as well.",1179878400,8,126,4.208333333333333
2755675,1,B000N4NOJ2,If it wasn't just 1-7 but 1-8 I would have ought it but unfortunately they didn't wait. Well maybe they'll make an another whole seasons box who knows?,1179532800,2,151,4.428571428571429
2755676,1,B000N4NOJ2,"why didn't they wait untill the last season was released to make a big ""complete"" box....?",1179273600,8,90,4.6875

8174725,2,B000N4NOJ2,"I bought these and had problems with probably 8 discs.  One was completely unviewable.  It would just start to play, lock up on a scene and I could never get it to move on.
I love the series, but the overall quality of the maker of this set was poor.
I also noticed that some discs had disclosures in Japanese or Chinese, some english.  Overall, felt like a mish mash of leftovers tossed together and not in correct order.",1212624000,3,422,4.3164556962025316
8174726,1,B000N4NOJ2,"If you're anything like me, you were tempted by the fact that you save $100, give or take.  However, it is absolutely not worth it.  The quality control on these sets ranges from abysmal to non-existent, and you don't even get Season 8.  Of my entire series, only 7 discs played properly.  Most of the set was unplayable due to skips; by the middle of the episodes the DVD had frozen entirely or was jolting ahead.  Season 3 didn't have episodes loaded onto the discs for the entire season, and half of Season 5 couldn't even be read by my DVD player.  And that's not even counting all of the problems with the subtitles, no chapter selection, and no extras.

This set is no frills added, and unfortunately the ""frills"" include quality control.  It's worth paying the extra money if you really want the entire series, or looking around to find the series at a lower price.  Plus, you won't have the hassle of trying to get a refund for your shoddy purchase.",1209945600,2,957,4.485549132947977
