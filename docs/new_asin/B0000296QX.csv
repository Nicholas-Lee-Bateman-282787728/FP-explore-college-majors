1252680,4,B0000296QX,"The film tells the story of Selina, a beatiful female cop, who is assigned to bodyguard a middle eastern prince who is staying in Hong Kong. But then, a mad scientist who has transfered his mind into a cyborge which looks human comes and kills Selina, then kidnaps the prince and holds him for ransom. To save the prince and stop the evil scientist-turned killer cyborge, good scientist Dr. Sara and her cyborge assistant Ann transfer Selina's mind into the body of a cyborge that looks just like her. Now Selina, Ann, Dr. Sara and Selina's cop fiance (who has been told Selina survived the shooting and doesn't know she's a cyborge now,) must team up to defeat the bad guy.

This film has lots of great action, violence, (and, of course, nudity and sex,) and I loved the story of Selina's dilema as a reluctant cyborge. And the film has it's share of funny moments as well. Overall, if you can stomach extreme violence, I recomend this film. However, two things about this video knock it down a star. (One is a major plot spoiler, be forwarned.)

The villain, aside from being a vicious killer, is also a rapiest. Not only that, but one of his victims who survives is seen the next day acting just as if nothing's wrong. (The things I've learned about rape victims and the kind of psychological damage they suffer would seem to contradict this.)

Then there is the climax. (WARNING: PLOT SPOILER AHEAD) Through out the whole film we're lead to believe Selina is the main hero, and certainly we'd love to see her get back at the man who killed her. But then she's incappacitated and it's up to Ann and the male hero to save the day. Otherwise, though, this is a great film.",1098230400,3,1673,4.514851485148514
1252681,5,B0000296QX,"If you enjoy the aforementioned,you will enjoy this film. I was impressed by the budget and acting. The humor was well done also.
 Yes,the actresses are pretty-but scenery can't make a good film. So,in essence-robots are created,one renegade developer transfers his essence into a cyborg. The other developers fear you cannot control the human spirit-but must transfer the heroines soul into a robotic recreation of herself to counter the villain. There is nudity,but it makes sense.
 A good story,good acting,solid budget. Worth the price.",1021161600,4,540,5.416666666666667
1252682,4,B0000296QX,"Good film! Better than most American Sci-Fi films! I recommend 'Naked Killer' before this movie, though! It's good, but not as good as 'Naked Killer'.",995932800,,150,5.04
1252683,2,B0000296QX,"I went into this movie expecting to see gorgeous naked Asian women, and for the most part that's what I got.  However, I feel it is worth mentioning that the phenomenally gorgeous Amy Yip, while appearing nude, does not actually show anything.  She is always conveniently covered.  I understand that she is somewhat well known for this (called ""Yip Tease""), so if you want to see her naked, you will have to look somewhere else.  Of course, there are several other gorgeous women who are not so demure, so if that's what you're looking for and don't care whether it's Yip or not, I recommend this video.",995155200,,603,4.607476635514018
7915605,3,B0000296QX,"Movie is dubbed in English.  A high ranking female detective is assigned to guard a Middle Eastern Prince visiting Hong Kong.  The Prince was kidnapped by a robotic specialist and the detective was killed in the process.  That same detective's mind was later transferred into a robot (think ""Six Million Dollar Woman""--same concept).  The new robotic detective has the mindset of the human detective, but with the mechanical body that has the ability to fight with agility like that of a human.  The robotic detective now must work with another robotic assistant to find the lunatic kidnapper who wants a ransom from the Middle Eastern King or his son will be killed.  The lunatic kidnapper also transferred his mind to a robot, so he has strong fighting capabilities.  Of course the detective and her assistant search and find the lunatic, and all the robots get into fights.  As a side story, the detective has a boyfriend who is a cop too, and he must deal with her death only to later deal with seeing his girlfriend alive again.  In being honest with him, she reveals herself a robot and now he must deal with deciding with if he can love her even though she is now an android with the mind of his girlfriend.  She remembers everything they went through together, but doesn't have a human body even though it has the appearance of her original body.

The movie has 1980s styles, similar to the first Terminator movie, but it has an Asian feel to the effects in the fight scenes that reminds the viewer of the Power Rangers.  The story is decent with action and romance, but it's got the feel of the 1980s.  For it's time, this was a well made film.  If this movie was to be rated, it would be rated R as it contains female nudity.",1525564800,,1735,4.536977491961415
7915606,5,B0000296QX,This translation version keeps the storyline intact very well. I appreciated this 2010 version was 16:9. I liked the robot premise. This Amazon Prime trip is treating me to lots of different types of stories. There was lots of violence consisting of plenty of gun shooting and plenty of kicking and punching.,1500681600,,308,4.9423076923076925

7915609,4,B0000296QX,"DVD Review: Pertaining to the Bonzai, PanMedia generic version. It's pretty much the same as the Joy Sales version but with a different menu and lousy English dubbing. The transfer picture and sound quality is great and the English subtitles are perfect though I couldn't tell you as to whether they were accurately translated properly but eh, what the **** do I care?

Movie Review: An evil robot kidnaps a prince and is running around raping women for no reason. NEED I SAY MORE? Well yes. This movie is a softcore porn/sci-fi/action movie. It has a lot of funny death scenes, lots of rape, kung fu action, cyber-punk elements, bad acting, boobs, butts, beavers, and EVEN a one-eyed willy. I don't find sex scenes entertaining because it acts as an inconsistency to pacing in films but MY GOD was the boobs on this one chick great. UUUUUUUUH!

Conclusion: 4 stars for the DVD and 4 stars for the film.",1414281600,,903,4.672955974842767
7915610,5,B0000296QX,this is a sci fi chinese film about a future world wher machines or androids are every where and it stars the pretty amy yip. good movie for the sci fi content and a good film for the nudity also. this is just like the american b-movies. except with a better story line. I watch b-movoes for the often showing of women. and this one is no differnt it pretty much a androind (amy yip) that want to be human and what it like about trying to be human is the sex act. so it works in like a brothel. so that pretty much the whole of the move and I like it. and its a good movie for my amy yip collection but for any chinese cult film collection you may have this would be a good one.,1322438400,,678,3.884892086330935
7915611,5,B0000296QX,"Greetings;

There are several editions of this movie out there, this one appears to be a regionless Chinese edition, based on the characters I see(script-wise, not actors). I am familiar with the prodiction company as well, having also made several of the Mr Vampire movies I have seen, or so I beleive it was...Mr Vampire part 1 and Magic Cop, to name but a few. Not important really, but all the same.

I had seen this movie years ago as a VHS, which I still own, but I have been looking to upgrade to a DVD copy, my earlier searches for it revealed copies that seemed to be a bit out there. I mean, it is a good movie, sure. There is at this moment, a VHS copy of it on Amazon for about $70, if you can beleive that. At any rate, finding a decently priced copy like this was unexpected, though not unwelcome. You just have to keep looking sometimes to really find little Gems like this. As for the movie itself, it was quite funny at times. Did it have the best special effects? The best acting? No, but all in all it was more than decent. Simulated sex scenes as one might come to expect(Actual porn never really makes it to this level of production, no english subtitles, no dubbing, little releasing whatsoever outside of its country of origin at all, if you want a better understanding of it, I personally recommend watching the interviews of Reiko Yamaguchi in 'The Japanese Wife Next Door' as she explains her jump from regular hard-core porn to the softcore movie-movies. The movie was also very good too, actually, but the interview was in some senses educational I suppose you could call it).

I seem to recall seeing other copies on Amazon that said they were English Dubbed, I think that perhaps even my VHS copy had been too, though it has been a while, so I am not completly sure. Either way though, a very good movie and certainly well worth getting, provided you don't mind a little slap-stick with your simulated sex. Ah yes, my VHS copy had been English Dubbed and the company that released it was 'Tokya Shock,' whereas this DVD copy dubbed in Cantonese is released by Media Asia LTD. I bought this knowing it wasn't in English, so I am not complaining really, but I wasn't sure about my old copy until I finally dug it back up-been hidden away in my closet in some boxes since having moved to our new home, not hiding it, its just I don't have my vhs player hooked up so my VHS tapes arn't really out for me to get at easily.

Thank you and take care...",1295136000,,2475,4.373913043478261
7915612,5,B0000296QX,"No review can do this justice.  If you like off-beat movies, Hong Kong movies, or just Amy Yip's buxomy presence, you can't go wrong with this twisted little adventure film.  It's equal parts comedy, adventure, and soft core.  A wonderful holiday gift for that twisted individual on your list.",1257638400,,293,4.938775510204081
7915613,4,B0000296QX,"If tou like crazy films like ""the Story of Riki"", then you eill like Robotrix. Its so outrageously violent that it had me laughing through the whole film. There are often comparisons to this film and Robocop; I think one some levels there are similarities but Robotrix is more violent.

The story centers around a cyborg with poor impulse control who goes on a murderous rampage, while taking time to commit acts of rape along the way. Police create their own cyborg to fight the bad guy, which results in more mayhem (yep, crazy killing,raping robots).

Totally crazy, but entertaining nonetheless.",1256342400,,599,4.920792079207921
7915614,4,B0000296QX,"Jamie Luk directs this cheesy, breezy action flick that suggests a (near) future scenario when robot technology creates lifelike, but incredibly agile and powerful cyborgs.  A warped Japanese scientist kidnaps a wealthy shiek's son, then transfers his own intelligence into  an android and basically dares the world to stop him.  He then goes on a raping and killing spree, targeting mainly prostitutes.  Lovely police officer Selena Lam (Chikako Aoyama) who was killed while trying to protect the sheik's son, is given new life, Robocop-style, as a mean fighting machine (but still great-looking) and given the mission of doing battle with the evil android. Assisting her are beautiful robot creator Dr. Sara (Hiu-Dan Hui), her stunning and big-chested mechanical alter ego (Amy Yip) and Selena's boyfriend and fellow cop, who is unaware that she has been ""changed"".  Goofiness, action, sex, nudity, violence and brutality ensue. Except for some jarring scenes of sexual assault, the whole mess is very entertaining.  The cast and crew put a lot of energy into the production, but also slipped in some weird Japanese slapstick humor (especially involving Selena's fellow cops, who are male, quite horny and inept).  Selena also has some touching scenes with her boyfriend, exploring the question:  What would you do if you just had fantastic sex with someone, only to find out later that they were really dead and their mind had been transferred to a machine?  Serious question, indeed, but no time for that, the world must be saved!  Robotrix is a kind of live-action anime, definitely not for kids. (This review is for the re-mastered, uncut version).",1231286400,7,1654,5.184210526315789
