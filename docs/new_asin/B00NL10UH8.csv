8678794,5,B00NL10UH8,"The movie is difficult to watch in places, but the compelling recovery at the end, which requires a box of facial tissues, makes the pain of watching the tragedy mostly worthwhile.  I will explain the mostly part later.  Readers should also be aware that this movie is based on a real life rape in South Korea that occurred in 2008.  Knowing the events are based on real events is what makes this movie difficult to watch in places.

***  WARNING:  Plot spoilers ahead.  ***

Eight-year-old So Won, which means wish or hope in English, is on her way to school when she is brutally attacked by a pedophile who was allegedly drunk at the time of the attack.  So Won's injuries are so severe that she easily could have died from them.  Indeed, So Won requires multiple surgeries to deal with damage to her large intestine and anus, and her injuries will affect her for the rest of her life.

As difficult as it is to see an eight-year-old girl who has been brutally raped (which is fortunately, and tastefully, not shown at all), beaten, and left for dead (of course this is a movie, but the movie portrays real people and real events), the core of this movie is the perseverance of So Won.  This small, defenseless child, through no fault of her own, is harmed in the most awful and foul ways, and yet the core goodness and recovery of So Won, which makes me tear up even as I write this, reminds us that there remains good in the world, even if it feels like that good is woefully less than it should be.

After the attack, So Won does not want to see her father.  Family relationships are strained, and one has to wonder whether the family will recover.  But, as has been said before, it takes a village to raise a child, and friends of the family and friends of So Won are shown tactfully helping out in many ways, small and large.  At the same time, So Won's father dons the costume of a favorite cartoon character, Kokomong, on a daily basis to be able to interact with his daughter.

As painful as it is to see So Won's injuries and to watch So Won recover, even knowing it is only a movie, the worst part of this movie is the trial of the pedophile who raped So Won.  Frankly, the punishment is a fraction of what this creature should have received.  There came a point where I wanted to beat this individual to death for what he did, mirroring the outrage of the courtroom audience, and the population of South Korea generally in 2008, because in real life this lowlife received what many called a way too lenient sentence for what should have been deemed attempted murder.  As an aside, this same individual is known to have raped other little girls (not mentioned in the film, but well documented elsewhere), and the film provides no resolution regarding the inadequate sentence received by this monster.

The ending of the movie is upbeat, but upbeat in a bittersweet way.  After all, the rapist will eventually go free, and So Won's injuries will be with her for the rest of her life.  Yet, she is alive and remains lovingly supported by her family and friends.  Indeed, it is hard to avoid falling in love with the character of So Won, effectively played by young Korean actress Lee Re.

Note that this movie is in Korean with subtitles, so be prepared to pay attention to the subtitles while the movie is playing.  Also, at the time of this review, the DVD is apparently no longer available on Amazon.  Hopefully it will be available again in the future.  Until then, it is possible that it is available from other sources or from streaming video services.

Typically, I am not a fan of tear-jerkers.  After all, the world is sad enough as it is.  Yet, the story of So Won's recovery from near death is heart-warming, though having facial tissues to deal with watery eyes is advised, and the significant other and I were mesmerized to the end.  We wish the true-life young lady, who is now about 16 years old at the time of this review, the very best.

Usually I end my review with either enjoy or good luck.  In this case, I would say ""enjoy,"" but such an ending seems inappropriate to the tragic circumstances that happened in real life that are mirrored in this movie.  In this particular case, the 5 stars will have to be an indication of the feelings of the significant other and myself about this movie.",1477785600,,4321,4.461146496815287
