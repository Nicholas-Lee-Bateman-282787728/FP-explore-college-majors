Surprisingly entertaining, a must see.  Loved the main lead actor as he is so convincing in this role, gives a flawless performance. Movies with such flawless, hilarious and fresh scripts are so hard to find.",1461888000,,468,5.038961038961039
8428486,4,B004G381X0,I enjoyed the shy nerdy side of John. His love interest and him had good chemistry. The songs are so upbeat that I wanted to sing them over and over even though I am American.,1396483200,,175,4.0285714285714285

8428488,4,B004G381X0,"What would you do if your phone number got mixed up with a suicide help-line?  This is the basic premise for Jhootha Hi Sahi.  However, the movie is not only limited to this premise, but the relationships between ""anonymous friends"" and between long-time friends are examined in a fresh and entertaining way.  I enjoyed this movie and it was successful in what it aims to do - entertain!  There are many subtle statements/judgements applied to various situations and relationships, but these do not detract from the plot.  I was not quite ready for the movie to end when it did.
Remember, always answer your phone, even in the middle of the night, and be prepared to listen!",1301961600,,674,4.726495726495727
8428489,3,B004G381X0,"After JAANE TU YA JAANE NA, Abbas Tyrewala comes up with yet another refreshing romcom in the form of JHOOTHA HI SAHI. It's a nicely written film, with good performances and inspiring music. Though we've seen such films in the past, it's Abbas' fresh treatment which makes it an exciting watch.

Abbas' narrative is fresh and keeps the tempo up. The slice-of-life moments keep you entertained. However, it's extended and highly exaggerated climax is difficult to grasp.

A R Rahman's music slowly grows on you. Cry Cry and Do Nushaaniyan are appealing. Manoj Lobo's impressive cinematography shows London in a new light.

John Abraham is excellent in his geek role. You fall in love with his quaint mannerisms. Pakhi gives a good performance but falters mildly in the emotional moments. MTV Rodies fame Raghu Ram impresses and how! He performs his role with ease and panache. Manasi Scott is decent. All the other characters including Anaitha Nair, Alishka Varde, Prahsant Chawla and George Young are excellent in their small roles. Voice cameos by Imran Khan, Abhishek Bachchan and Riteish Deshmukh are passable. R Madhavan's cameo fails to amaze.

JHOOTHA HI SAHI works for its fresh approach and superior performances. It proves lying isn't that bad, after all. JHOOTHA is SAHI!",1300579200,,1281,5.085714285714285
