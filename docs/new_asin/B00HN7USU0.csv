6184727,2,B00HN7USU0,"This movie has to go down as one of the biggest wastes of time, money and talent in recent sci-fi history. First, you have at least one very talented actor in John Rhys-Davies, what looks to be a generously financed production, some excellent special effects with minimal gaudy CGI, some beautiful on-location cinematography and well-polished editing. It would seem to be a recipe for success, until you try following the storyline.

To put it mildly, the screenplay for this movie was just awful. The entire plot is just so plain unbelievable that no group of actors could possibly have pulled this thing out of the fire, not that the film had much good acting. After watching this mess, I took a look at the credits, and found the rather obvious turd in the punchbowl. Uwe Boll. Uwe is the only producer I know of that consistently manages to somehow ruin every project he has lent his creative ""talent"" to. After awhile, I both felt sorry for the actors for having to repeat such ridiculous dialogue while simultaneously loathing their characters. To say that the characters are undeveloped is being kind.

To make matters worse, the script is just plain insulting to anyone who knows anything about Egyptology. The story doesn't seem to keep it's facts straight and some of the casting really left me scratching my head. For example, why do the supposedly native Egyptians in the movie have Mexican accents? At the end of the movie, my only thoughts were... WHY? So many whys. So few (good) answers to explain them. It's almost like they were actually trying to make a bad movie. Disappointing and confusing are the two best words to describe this film. Don't waste your time.",1405123200,6,1680,4.789655172413793

6184729,2,B00HN7USU0,"From the opening scenes, Egypt was started by aliens lead by Osiris. Their intent was to conquer the world, but somehow they got trapped and buried in a pyramid and can reactivate every 5,000 years when certain stars line up.  There is a bronze key that is needed to open it,  a bad guy, the professor and Mary  Ann all go to the tomb at the right time etc.

The plot was boring.  The science has horrible. A few things... There are no stellar alignments that take place every 5,000 years. Sirius was never a pole star. And you can't carbon date bronze, it has no organic carbon.

The movie attempts to be a combination of ""The Mummy"" ""Stargate"" and ""Indian Jones.""  And not the good Indian Jones film, the one with the Crystal Skull.  The film is too short and formulaic.  The characters were shallow. The special effects were above Asylum grade, except for that one insect thing.

Might work for the kids.

8633643,2,B00HN7USU0,"Dear God in heaven, what did I do? Any movie with David Charvet as a star has got to be a problem. I can't believe that I managed to watch the entire thing. Another thing what happened to John Rhys Davies, he was so good years ago (the Indiana Jones movies) now any movie that has him in it must be avoided at all costs. I watched another mess of his yesterday. Stock characters doing the same thing all the time, just walking thru a pyramid and being hunted by the curse. No one actually did any acting just bad expressions and posturing. Avoid this one. I should have.",1448409600,,570,4.238532110091743

8633647,2,B00HN7USU0,"This is just an ordinary movie, not real bad, just below average.  John Rhys-Davies and Joss Acklund add a little in name value, but after an interesting inventive narrative at the beginning it never really comes across.  Good idea, too many flaws in the script and not really explained well backstories on many of the characters.  You follow a group of archeologist and others into a hidden pyramid that is revealed by a huge sandstorm just three days before a event that takes place once in 5000 years.  Now they have to get in in three days and find the secret that only John Rhys-Davies knows.  They tease you with a mummy and the idea of aliens (which you know because of the opening narrative), but none of the cast except John Rhys-Davies knows.  Everyone else is just confused.",1409011200,,785,4.611510791366906
