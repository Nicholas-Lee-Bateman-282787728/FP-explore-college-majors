5025802,5,B006WPDKLI,"YMAA has set a terrific price point for the information contained in this fantastic production.  This DVD offers nearly 5 hours of explanation of a Yang-style long form consisting of 113 postures, an unsurpassed value.  A list of postures is included in the DVD jacket.  Previous reviewer ravings indicate the quality and utility of this YMAA publication.  There is no need to repeat previous comments, so I will just make the following comment:  ""Believe what they say!""

The only ""negative"" (and not really a negative comment as much as a head-scratch moment) that I could come up with is that while the DVD provides a great instructional tool for the beginner and a must-have resource for the experienced practitioner, first-timers should start with the Simplified 24 and 48 posture book and DVD, by Liang, Shou-Yu and Yang, Jwing-Ming (also highly recommended publications).  In 14 years of practice, I have yet to encounter a ""beginner"" group or student that is practicing a 113-posture form.  The Standardized 24-posture routine is the most widely practice tai chi form in the world for good reason and should therefore be the first stepping stone for the beginner.  However, I do not want to discourage those wishing to dive in head first into the health benefits of practice of tai chi.  Why start small?",1332201600,17,1312,4.977064220183486
5025803,5,B006WPDKLI,"Yang Tai Chi for beginners by Master Yang is a superb instructional DVD for not only the beginning Tai Chi student but for all levels of students of the art. This DVD is done masterfully in beautiful settings and is photographed professionally for everyone to enjoy. This is probably the most well done instructional DVD of Tai Chi that I have ever seen.

Dr. Yang first describes the background of Tai Chi and then explains the meaning of each movement, how the movements relaxes the mind and body completely, how the exercise improves health and expounds upon what Tai Chi does for the practitioner. Dr. Yang exlains all this in step- by- step analysis and also shows how this all relates to Qigung and describes the benefits of the connection of the mind, body and soul which can come about by the correct performance of these movements.

Each form and movement is demonstrated from front, rear and side which helps tremendously. Each form, including the way the hand is held and the placement of the tongue, is described in an interesting manner. Dr. Yang explains the reason and the importance for these proper postures so the student knows why it should be done correctly.

There is a group demonstration in which the complete movement is performed and then later Dr. Yang demonstrates and teaches the actual form for practice by the student. In this instruction, the student learns the full essence of Tai Chi. The student learns how to perform even the smallest part of the exercise so that the full benefit is obtained. This is done by showing the individual parts of each movement and then in the whole. All the while, Dr. Yang continues explaining the meaning and reason for the movement.

I will say again that all levels of students of Tai Chi can benefit from this masterful and instructional DVD. I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the movements, the meaning and the joy of Tai Chi. This is an interesting, educational and valuable DVD for the practitioner of Tai Chi.",1331424000,19,1995,4.740634005763689
5025804,5,B006WPDKLI,"Set in Dr. Jwing-Ming Yang's retreat in northern California, this high quality, beautifully filmed, YMAA DVD is a complete Yang style Tai Chi program for beginners and students of all experience levels - regardless of its title or ""level 1"" skill rating. With the exception of joining a Tai Chi school and studying with a qualified master, I couldn't recommend a better Yang style program - for anyone.

Along with performing the complete Yang style form (solo and with his students), Dr. Yang breaks down the form into individual movements with multiple frontal and side views - each painstakingly explained and demonstrated.  The camera work is excellent and each movement is very easy to follow and understand.

In addition, Dr. Yang shares his vast knowledge of Tai Chi and martial arts as he explains the theory behind each move, including correct breathing and - with the help of one of his students - martial applications. All commentary is reinforced with subtitles for complete clarity. The demonstration section of the DVD concludes with a rear view of the entire form (performed by one of Dr. Yang's students).

Dr. Yang sums up his Yang Tai Chi program with a concise and informative ""Conclusion"" chapter. As an added bonus, Dr. Yang describes the levels of mental and spiritual enlightenment that may be reached through Tai Chi practice in ""Song of the Real Meaning of Tai Chi"". At almost 5 hours (293 minutes), ""Yang Tai Chi for Beginners"" is a comprehensive and invaluable program for beginners and experienced practitioners of Tai Chi. Very well done and highly recommended!",1331078400,12,1590,5.011363636363637
5025805,5,B006WPDKLI,"This is really the best version of any DVD that teaches the Yang style.  Previously I have reviewed ""Simplified Tai Chi Chuan"" by Master Liang, Shou-Yu.  And, while ""Simplified"" is still an excellent DVD, I find this one (""Yang Tai Chi for Beginners""),much more appropriate for the beginner.

Everything you need is here to embark on a lifelong love and practice of Tai chi Chuan.  The form is taught step by step.  Each and every step is accompanied by Dr. Yang's gentle and comprehensive form of communication.  His teaching style is such that it takes place beside you, rather than from the TV screen in front of you.  He explains ever movement in flowing detail.

---Actually, on the beginning move (I initially thought) he got into a little, too, much detail and I found myself hoping that this was not going to be the way with each and every move; else it would have turned this DVD into a snooze fest.  What I found, when I replayed the instructions for the first technique, was a very valuable lecture on the importance of the foundation being establish in this discipline.  The rest of the moves flow rather quickly.  Dr. Yang pauses where necessary to explain in detail, a tricky move or to demonstrate martial application.

Someone I love is a brittle diabetic and faces the challenges that 40 years of this dreaded disease can generate.  We are working together to develop a regular routine of Tai Chi Practice and this very DVD has made that possible.  Developing balance and keeping her body moving everyday is our number one goal, and it is essential to her long term health.

Be sure to take a few moments and watch both the introduction to the DVD and the chapter entitled:  ""About Yang style Tai Chi"".  Any time Dr. Yang speaks, there is great benefit for the student.

After you become proficient in the practice of Yang style Tai Chi, and ""IF"" you have a desire to expand your Tai Chi and develop its martial applications, I suggest you purchase Dr. Yang's:  ""Taiji Martial Applications 37-Postures",1330819200,21,2018,4.698005698005698
5025806,5,B006WPDKLI,"Any martial artist interested in the Chinese martial arts should get their hands on Yang Tai Chi for Beginners.

Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming takes the viewer through each step of the tai chi chuan form for Yang style. Each step is clearly labeled with English, Chinese, and the Chinese ideograms. At each new movement, he explains both the structure and the application and shows each from different angles.

Dr. Yang sprinkles in bits of tai chi history and philosophy throughout the nearly five-hour-long DVD. He explains why his style does what it does, and he explains that other styles have their own ways. Instead of discriminating against other styles, he acknowledges that they exist, doesn't say whether one is better than another, and encourages the viewer to follow what his instructor teaches.

I've only purchased a handful of instructional DVDs. The ones I run across seem to always have poor production quality and lack easy navigation. YMAA, however, comes through in both respects.",1330819200,9,991,5.104938271604938
5025807,5,B006WPDKLI,"I am very impressed. This DVD is packed with detailed, practical information and useful theories.
Demonstrating the applications of the individual Tai Chi moves clarifies the whys and the hows of the form.

The Good:
- the captions!
- showing the movements from different angles!

The Not So Good:
Dr. Yang speaks with accent (charming, but not so easy to understand sometimes) and talked too fast, (perhaps too enthusiastic?) therefore the captions were super helpful.

A definite recommendation on this DVD for beginner or even someone who has been practising for a while because of the amount of knowledge that is clearly disseminated. No matter which style of Tai Chi one is learning, Dr. Yang gives good practical explanations so one can learn Tai Chi on a deeper level",1330300800,2,774,4.984496124031008
5025808,5,B006WPDKLI,"I have Dr. Yang's earlier DVD ""Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style"" and while it's a great supplement to taking lessons and reading the book, I think it's hard for a beginner to follow along because the camera keeps cutting to different angles and the student can get lost as to which direction to move.
This new video has so much to offer a beginner, that's it's a world of difference.  The whole sequence is shot from one steady camera angle both from the front and the back so the student can follow along easily.  Also in the instruction part, each movement is broken down from several angles, but mostly Dr Yang turns and explains why while the camera stays steady.  I find this so much easier to follow.  There are some other camera angles and closeups when needed to emphasize a technique, but they were very well integrated and easy to follow.  I can't imagine the amount of work that went into filming and edtiting this project to get such a thorough and easily followed final DVD.
I give this my highest recommendation for anyone interested in Tai Chi or martial arts.  Five stars hardly seems adequate for this one.",1329436800,420,1122,4.613065326633166
5025809,5,B006WPDKLI,"I originally bought Dr. Yang's earlier video, Tai Chi Chuan, Classical Yang Style, which I still like for its qigong section and its introduction to the stances and steppings, but Yang Tai Chi for Beginners surpasses it by far when it comes to exposing the form. The disc is five hours long, and most of that is devoted to detailed demonstrations of each posture, from different angles, and with demonstrations of the martial applications of each posture. The video was shot outdoors in the mountains of Northern California, and the camera work is excellent. You can always see Dr. Yang's feet and hands (my biggest complaint about the earlier video was that some crucial hand movements were not shown because the camera was on the feet).",1329091200,88,738,4.865079365079365
5025810,5,B006WPDKLI,"This is an excellent DVD for the serious beginner and it will take you beyond the initial learning of a form. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is an icon in the martial arts world and, as such, does a wonderful job of introducing Yang Style tai chi to the beginner.

Each move of the long form is broken down to it's structure, martial application and it's usefulness to health and flexibility. In addition to showing how a move is performed, Dr. Yang also shows how it should not be done. For example, many new beginners project the rear when doing moves such as parting wild horses mane or ward off. He very clearly shows how tucking the tail bone under will give the body more roundness and grounding. I find that a very useful way to learn, because sometimes we just don't process all the nuances of a stance at first look. It is good to know exactly what we are doing incorrectly and to be shown how to correct it.

The DVD runs for almost 5 hours, so it is not a quick run through of a short form. There is a great deal of information shared and it is presented from various angles to make it easy to see all of the details. The skill level is listed as beginner and it will be easy for a beginner to understand and follow. I found many useful tips in this presentation of the long form. I have been teaching tai chi for 15 years. There is always something to discover, even in the simplest of movements.

The filming of the movements is quite nice; outside, on a mountain top with beautiful soft music. A rooster crowing in the background brought a smile to my face when Dr. Yang stopped is lesson and apologized for the noise. He said, ""we live in the mountains"". I also liked his humbleness when he performed an application with a student and was surprised that it was hard to do. He said, ""I am getting old and he is getting stronger, that was hard"". Not often you will hear a Grandmaster admit that he has to work at a move.

All in all, this is a wonderful value for the beginner and those looking to move beyond the surface of tai chi.",1328659200,81,2036,4.266839378238342

5025832,2,B006WPDKLI,"The instructor's accent is very hard to understand, so you have to read the subtitles and watch his movements at the same time. This video is also geared much more toward the combat aspect of Tai Chi, so if you're looking for something simple to use for exercise or relaxation, this is not the DVD for you. Less talk and more demonstration would've been nice.",1520467200,,359,4.538461538461538

It is so much easier to learn from a person who exemplifies in presence and movement what he is teaching in words.  He not only teaches the movements of tai chi, but also the reason for the movements and the ways to adapt these movements to fit with your unique body.  He gives great tips concerning how to prevent injuries in your practice.  I find the essence of his movement instruction finding its expression  in the way I move while working and playing in my everyday life.

I can see where other reviews had difficulties understanding the instructor, but it's actually fairly clear.  I like that I can surf back and forth to practice one particular position and move.

5025864,5,B006WPDKLI,"My family brought this DVD as my retirement gift in 2014. It is exactly after 3 years that I am able to practice the full 113 forms (about 40 of the forms are just repetitions). Before you buy, please make sure you can commit your time and patience to learn form by form. Some reviewer said that Master Yang talked too much and spent too many time on each form. Please understand that Tai Chi is also a kind of martial arts, so you need to understand what is each form about (attack or defense). It is making no sense to perform ""The Crane Spreads Its Wings"" just following the movement of the hands and feet without knowing what the movements for. For traditional Chinese martial arts, I don't think the masters would tell you how to breath (inhale exhale step by step). Master Yang only said once that you exhale when strike. It is different form Yoga or other western exercises. Once you learn and practice, you will breath naturally. If you have the patience to watch till after the 3rd part, Master Yang has a demo of the whole 113 forms from start to end. It is good for you to follow and practice once you know all forms.
So if you have no patience to follow and learn each form one by one, you better find another DVD that teaches 24 simplified forms. Those DVDs will let you follow the movements and teach you how to breath. They are more easy to learn and follow than this one (24 versus 113). You will also find it interesting that those simplified forms are different from Master Yang's teaching forms. Master Yang is teaching more traditional Yang Tai Chi. As he said in the DVD, we have to follow his movement and not dancing around. Simplified 24 (36 or other) forms are more like dancing. Though they serve very good Tai Chi practice too. I am also learning those Simplified 24 forms and found them very interesting and fun to do.
Now I spent 3 years and am enjoying what I have learned by practicing each day. Thank you Dr. Yang.",1490572800,,1946,4.378453038674033

5025876,5,B006WPDKLI,"Tai Chi is spreading through the United States like a dust storm blowing across the Oklahoma plains! I have seen versions of it surface in adult care facilities, libraries, yoga centers, YMCAs, and hospitals. But what is the meaning of Tai Chi, its various purposes, and its benefits? All of those questions, and more, are answered in the 293 minute instructional DVD, Yang Tai Chi for Beginners, by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, award-winning martial artist and instructor.

Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming walks the learner/viewer through the longer form of Yang style Tai Chi, a form that includes 37 postures and 113 stances. Though the thought of learning 113 stances may sound daunting, the majority of the steps are repeats of the 37 postures being done in several different directions throughout the form. Therefore the student is really only learning the 37 postures, with a good amount of muscle-memory reinforcement. Proper breathing is also emphasized, when to inhale, exhale, and how to breath.

In the first half of the DVD Dr. Yang breaks the form down into three segments. The first is the most instruction-intense because almost all of postures surface here. He spends a considerable amount of time explaining stances, spine position, foot location, hand action, fluidity, and movements from one part to the next. But also, since Tai Chi is a martial art, Dr. Yang emphasizes the self-defense features that are just under the surface. To the untrained eye Tai Chi may look limp, lithe and primarily about relaxation, yet Dr. Yang makes a strong case for the self-protective facet flowing in the postures and positions that are not easily perceived.

The second half of the DVD is set up for the learner to practice the three segments of the Yang style Tai Chi uninterrupted. Accompanied by the calming music playing softly in the background, the viewer can follow, step-by-step, with Dr. Yang. Theres even a rear-view part in the DVD to make following along easier. Finally Dr. Yang spends a few moments explaining the history of Yang style Tai Chi, why it is more popular than another type, how it gets easily and thoughtlessly promoted only for its relaxation benefits, and why the fighting purpose of the form is important to keep in mind.

Yang Tai Chi for Beginners is a pleasant instructional DVD for those wanting to learn Tai Chi, get extra coaching outside their classes, or pick up the self-defense principles in the form. This DVD would make an ideal addition to the loanable resources at a martial arts school. It would also be fitting for a public or private library, and is invaluable for studying at home. I highly recommend Yang Tai Chi for Beginners (DVD).

For those who like minutely detailed instruction, this is for you.  Ten minutes in, you will still be learning the exact positions of your fingers and hands for the first move.  That the entire DVD is over four hours long is telling.  I appreciate Dr, Yang's dedication to helping people get every nuance down perfectly.

Some people probably won't like the history or instructions that each movement is a defensive or offensive move against an enemy, but for me it was enlightening. If you want to just ""learn a dance"" and not to understand the deeper meaning behind the moves, this isn't for you. If you want clear and in-depth instructions on not only how to perform the move and placement of hands, feet, how to move the hips, etc... but also what each move means or is meant to do should you be attacked, then this is for you.",1466208000,24,646,4.436974789915967

After watching it for about 20 minutes and he is still on the very first move of the form I am realizing he is the real deal. All of the other Tai Chi stuff I have watched is must going through the motions. Dr. Yang goes into incredible depth and detail of every subtlety of what makes each move effective and why, as well as illustrating the martial application of the movement when sped up. It is a little hard to understand what he says as he has broken English, but that makes it all the more authentic in my opinion.

When you practice meditational practices like Tai Chi, Yoga, or Qi Gong try incorporating the Saam Meditation Technique into your procedure. This is a meditation based upon a 500 year old Korean Acupuncture Technique. Instead of only focusing on the chakras or third eye, Saam Meditation technique brings one's Qi and attention to acupuncture points on the hands and feet. In doing so we can specifically target each of the twelve primary organs like the heart, liver, lungs, stomach, kidneys, etc. Meditation upon the hands and feet strongly stimulates the brain and intensifies the sensation and healing effects of Qi across the whole body. Saam Medical Meditation has pictures of the four point acupuncture combinations for each of the organs. Each point of the meditation is easy to locate.

in this path, being in a hurry is just not part of the deal.  This DVD is my ""bible"" of the DVD Tai Chi world.  I would
recommend this to anyone, beginners and advanced alike.  I really cannot add too much to the other most positive reviews...
I read a few of them and agree 100%.  Dr. Yang's teaching style ay or may not be for you, but this DVD is simply
priceless..  The martial aspect of this form that is shown on the DVD, for me at least, has been extremely helpful
and illustrative.  I could go on for pages, but I will leave here by saying that this DVD had kept me more interested and engaged than any other DVD or even live teaching.  Thank you.",1417996800,3,771,4.134228187919463

5025978,2,B006WPDKLI,"I can'tell speak for an in person instructional experience,  maybe he'said much better. As an instructional video this is poorly organized, scattered and hard to follow. Movements constantly get interrupted with explanations that would be better held until later. Show the entire movement, break down the movement into easily digestible (and discreet) sections, and then get into the rest of the explanations. Telling me why I'm doing something does me no good if I have no clue what I'm doing. For example, getting into a confusing monolog about the myriad ways in which the forms can be counted right after the second movement. Why is that there? Would you not be better served putting that, oh I don't know, at the beginning during the intro to Tai Chi?",1415923200,2,756,4.90625

I knew that tai chi and qigong would help me, but wasn't confident in the instruction in my area. So I did my research and found Dr Yang. The only way I can discribe him and his students/disciples is serious, educated, and physically conditioned. This man is genuine and very very good!

Having the disadvantage of no further classes in the intervening decades, this recent DVD and a number of his earlier productions have been a great help to me in refining my practice and understanding of the form.

One thing I especially appreciate about the teaching on this DVD is that includes the martial applications. Without having some sense of the potential purpose(s) of the movements, the nervous system can't really make sense of them. Having a sense of function against an imagined opponent organizes the nervous system in a way that is palpably different, and it offers a great advantage, not to mention greater pleasure. Even if you've learned another Yang style sequence, there's plenty to learn here with respect to the applications of the forms.

Never have I seen, in one place, the depth and clarity and detail presented here. There is more than enough here to keep you interested and edified whether you're new to tai chi or a highly experienced practitioner. For example, the concept of coiling, which is supposedly a key part of Chen style but I've never seen it discussed, let alone emphasized, in Yang or Wu styles--here, Dr Yang puts the coiling back where it belongs. Energy flow, body mechanics, and a truly detailed presentation are all present. I do want to note that if you are used to Yang style tai chi this version might be a surprise as it is rather different in many respects from other versions I've seen; however, I find it extremely gratifying to practice though I'm still in the early stages of learning this particular version of the form. I have several of Dr Yang's books but never gravitated to them. Seeing this, I'm going to study those books. He is truly masterful and most importantly, he gives you the key to grasping the internals of this ""internal"" martial art.",1392681600,3,1150,4.642156862745098

The whole sequence is then shown once in its entirely, as done by the master, followed by another demonstration presented by one of his pupils, and finally one whole Tai Qi presentation presented by a group of pupils.
The background scenery of the California woodland where master Yang's training centre is situated, hugely contributes to a deep sense of calm and wellbeing, and thus to motivate anyone watching the  video to learn the postures and movements.

I have not personally trained with him, but my teachers have and I've read books and watched movies of his.  I'm impressed every time.

Tai Chi can be an effective martial art but if you don't have patience and don't want to put the time in before the fighting applications become usable then you're kidding yourself, don't waste your time looking at Tai Chi dvds because it's not what you really want.

5026025,5,B006WPDKLI,"There are a lot of good Tai Chi DVDs out there. But this one is way better than good. Its superb. I could tell just from the cover that this DVD was going to be an extremely well-researched, very slick and highly informative DVD. You could also tell that Dr Yang, Jwing Ming wasn't just going to demonstrate techniques. He speaks from the heart. I am sure for him that the content in this DVD was just going to be the tip of the iceberg.

The content is presented as such with the user in mind. Many Tai Chi (or other martial arts) DVDs don't have this, to my mind. You get the great feeling that Dr Yang is more interested and determined in getting his message across as opposed to just showing the motions. I would say that the production values are high for sure. Its an engaging DVD and you will see Dr. Yang performing the Tai Chi form. Complete with a voice over and subtitles, the viewer can enjoy Dr Yang speaking of Tai Chi and describing its benefits, not just from a health point of view, but also in martial application. Its the martial application that is important, and this aspect is missing in many Tai Chi DVDs I have seen. There is also a group demonstration that Dr. Yang leads.

Dr Yang steps through the form in a very easy to follow manner. He does front view, side view and rear view. The picture is clear and crisp, and it is like you are there in front of him. As it is filmed outside, there is natural light and so there is absolutely no chance of obscurity. He points out common errors as he explains and he will also demonstrate with his students, so this DVD is an all-round DVD, not one that is geared towards health or some such. He is not there to make himself look good, he is there to impart his knowledge to which he does ever so well.

There's so much more to see in this excellent DVD and I believe that at over 290 minutes long that it is great value for money. You will definitely enjoy and learn a lot from this DVD, whether you do Tai Chi or not.

No DVD can replace in-person teaching by a qualified instructor but this DVD can help get a beginner over the hump of learning a tai chi form and putting into practice.

5026033,3,B006WPDKLI,"Yang, Jwing-Ming's, ""Yang Tai Chi for Beginners"" is certainly a worthwhile addition to the study of Tai Chi arts. Although Yang Long-Form practitioners will observe significant variation in form postures and sequences from traditional or commonly practiced Yang Tai Chi long form, these deviations or modifications are thoughtfully adapted to martial application technique, as taught by Yang, Jwing-Ming. It will take time to learn and adopt these  alternative Yang, Jwing-Ming style changes, but they are very insightful and worth exploring and incorporating, even as a stand-alone form practice.

It would have been very useful if the actual direction or orientation (e.g. Posture 44. Separate Right Foot [Northwest]) was provided for each posture, which can't be discerned from viewing the video. No warm-up exercise recommended or illustrated, lacking essential guidance for a beginner. Also, the 293 minutes I assume includes the ""Extra"" promotion video clips of other YMAA material, which is rather lengthy filler that are included with most of YMAA products. The ""Group"" demonstration has really no instructional value and like the ""Extras"" is needless filler that inflates the video length.

For those seeking at-home, self-taught instruction of Yang style Tai Chi simply for health benefits (no martial application), Terry Dunn's, ""Tai Chi for Health"" provides excellent, easy to follow DVD introduction for beginners in both short- and long-form.",1376697600,9,1456,5.639269406392694

5026035,5,B006WPDKLI,"I took Kung Fu for a number a years, and some of my training included a mixed Tai Chi form.  I got some benefit from this mixed Tai Chi form.  But, when I started to to this Yang Tai Chi form...wow!  At first, I found it hard to believe how much more I am getting from Dr. Yang's Yang Tai Chi form compared to the mixed form I learned in Kung Fu.  Dr. Yang does a great and thorough job of teaching the form.  He shows how to do each movement from various angels and shows it's self defense techniques.  I love this form!

A few years ago I got the 8 Brocades and QiGong for back pain from Dr. Yang.  What a difference doing these two exercises has had on my back and my overall health!  My back is 100 times better and one of the items doing the 8 brocades has eliminated are a lot of headaches I used to get.  I just love Dr. Yang and I highly appreciate him passing down the knowledge that he does.",1376438400,4,901,3.9555555555555557

Excellent camera work, repetitive movements from different angles until you can't help but get it right. I bought this instant video which has part 1( 2 hours )and it inspired me to buy the full DVD ( 5 hours ) that shows the rest of the movements.

5026039,5,B006WPDKLI,"Some of the reviews I've read when I was researching the book critisize Yang for referring to his DVD's and changing positions. I think you have to allow that this is only an introduction to Tai Chi and it is basic. If there is any difficulty, Tai Chi is not an easy subject to just go once to a class and go home and start practising, unlike Yoga. You have to study it and work at the postures. The only weakness I see is that there are some nuances not explained. For example, how rounding your arm and aligning your bones present a strong defense versus having your arm folder at an angle at your elbow. Another issue is that Yang explains in detail about using Tai Chi in combat. Beginning classes that I am familiar with would not do that and they would mostly likely leave out the kicks in the beginning. But if  you are patient and study and practise, you can learn much from from Yang.",1375056000,4,893,4.284023668639053

Dr., Yang is very concerned that you are able to do things right, and I appreciate his dedication.",1374883200,2,345,4.276923076923077
5026041,4,B006WPDKLI,"I got this DVD because the last Tai Chi DVD I got only did the moves via front view... So it was hard for me to follow because when the instructor would say to go right he would actually be moving to my left.  I'm not someone who grew up taking dance or any type of movement at all so when the person on the screen says to move right and what they mean of coarse is THEIR right while they are really moving MY left it just gets confusing to a novice like me.  I heard this DVD has rear views and to be fair it does- but it only has a demonstration of the whole series of movements in rear view.  I thought I'd be able to switch to various views of each movement with the click of a button.  So basically this DVD is not as fancy as I thought it would be.

I also wish the menu allowed me to just click on a movement so that I could work on that movement.  Instead I have to guess where the movement I want to learn is via the movie player bar and just find it that way.  The menu instead has the whole series divided into 3 parts and I think each part goes over about 12 or so movements.

Despite all this it's still a good buy.  It's definitely better than the other two tai chi dvds I have.  Perhaps my expectations were just too high.",1373155200,18,1237,3.8924302788844622

5026045,5,B006WPDKLI,"I have been religiously practicing the easy to follow video everyday since it arrived.  I have been a practitioner of Japanese hard styles of karate for most of my life.  It was a revelation to me when a friend demonstrated some moves on me many years ago.  He had practiced Tai Chi Chuan for 5 years and demonstrated considerable power for such a small man.
I was so impressed that I have always wanted to learn this ancient 4000 year old martial art.  I could not find classes to practice this art until now.
Now it is like having a master teaching me all of the moves and applications, which include 113 in the long form.  The video is so impressive because he takes so much time and from so many different angles, that you can correct your form on your own.  I had purchased an earlier video by Dr. Yang and it was far to sophisticated and for more advanced students.  It was filmed much too quickly and without explanation of each movement with application.  The video, for beginners, is by far the best video that I have ever seen on the martial arts.  I also love Dr. Yang's wonderful sense of humor.  You have to be really patient as you are really moving along if you can learn 10 movements in a couple of weeks.

Just beware this DVD is in UDF format and may not work properly on a Windows PC. I have an older laptop that is still at Windows XP SP2. Supposedly upgrading to SP3 provides support for UDF format if SP3 upgrade did not introduce new problems. It is very stable laptop and I do not wish risking a Windows upgrade. I have tried it on my wife's Windows 7 PC and it has similar issues with UDF/Codec.

What parts of the DVD I have been able to watch is excellent. I practice Taoist Tai Chi which is similar to Yang style but without the martial arts emphasis.

5026056,5,B006WPDKLI,"I studied Tai Chi for 2 years several decades ago under a very accomplished instructor in Chinatown, Boston.  I was a black belt in Karate prior to studying and had hoped that Tai Chi would enhance my martial arts skills.  The form turned my thighs into steel pillars but actually did nothing for my fighting abilities that I could see.  Our instructor did not speak English well and did not translate the moves into their martial applications.

I've forgotten all but the first 30 seconds of the form.  I bought this video to start again.  I have to say it is a huge improvement.  First of all, the teacher speaks English well enough.  But this is much enhanced by well-written English subtitles.  Second, he takes the time with each movement to fully explain what to do and shows each movement from different angles.  Third (and my favorite) is that he shows the martial applications on a student.  I finally see just how lethal Tai Chi really is.  I have since watched youtube videos of Tai Chi masters sparring with other martial arts adepts.  No contest.  Very impressive.  See [...]

Master Yang shows how the slow movement can be sped up for actual application in an impressive display of power and dexterity for a man of 65.

The benefit of being able to play and replay the moves is immense compared to a live class.  You have the instructor all to yourself and can get him to repeat the subtleties of each move.

Finally, I have watched other video performances of the form and have to say that this one is by far the best I've seen.  No comparison.

I am having a grand time having reached movement 9 (our of 108).

One con is that the video menu does not let you select the exact movement you have reached.  So if you are up to movement 30, you will need to click through chapters until you get there.  There is no 'Movement 30' menu item.  A small quibble compared to the positives.",1367020800,7,1895,4.470760233918129

5026064,5,B006WPDKLI,"There are two things that I look forward to from any YMAA instructional video. First are excellent production values. This video certainly meets the requirement. No poorly lit training hall shoot with a cheap video camera here. The entire video is top-of-the-line quality, and it is shot in a beautiful location to boot.

The second thing that I expect (esp. in any of Dr. Yang's  videos) is in-depth information and instruction. Once again, this DVD does not disappoint. It starts with an introduction, followed by a discussion of Yang-style Tai Chi. Then, the meat of the video begins with a group demonstration of the form, instruction on the form's individual postures  (with the larger form broken into three parts for ease of access), Master Yang demonstrating the form (once again broken into the three separate portions), and the entire form filmed from the rear view to provide more complete viewing angles. To wrap things up, Dr. Yang narrates a conclusion and discusses the meaning of Tai Chi via a classical Chinese poem on the subject. As can be seen, this is a very comprehensive introduction to Tai Chi practice.

The best, and most important, part of the video is the instructional portion in which Dr. Yang breaks down each posture in fine detail. There are literally hours of material here, covering everything from alignment, to movement, to even some introductory marital applications, all of which might seem intimidating to the Tai Chi neophyte. However, follow Dr. Yang's advice, and you need not suffer from information overload. Simply focus on one posture at a time, doing your best to master each posture before moving onto the next. Then, follow the same progression with the three parts of the form. Before you know it, you'll be making solid progress. And for the non-Tai chi martial artist who is considering whether or not to buy this video as an introduction to the art, I highly recommend that you do so. You will learn more about proper structure and movement in this video than you will from many instructors. And although a video can obviously never substitute for hands-on instruction, it could well set you down a new path, a previously unknown line of inquiry, that may lead to a deeper and more fully realized understanding of your home art.",1364688000,3,2282,4.904145077720207
5026065,5,B006WPDKLI,"Buddha said: ""Believe nothing, no matter if you have read it, or have heard it -- even if I have said it -- unless it rings true for you."" In other words, learn to discriminate for oneself.

Dr. Yang explains at the outset that true practice is not about playing soft music and doing a slow, choreographed dance; that understanding the form's martial application is essential; and on a spiritual level, Dr. Yang cites the Tai Chi classics so we appreciate the deeper meaning of the form.

Personally speaking, this level and quality of teaching is difficult to find, and Dr. Yang states that newer (western) adaptations look ""very funny to the Chinese.""

Plan to seriously and attentively absorb the form and the practice. And remember, Dr. Yang states that if you do the form for 30 years just like your teacher, you are a poor student.",1363996800,6,837,4.680272108843537

The DVD did NOT disappoint.  The explanations of the moves are clear, well demonstrated, and their martial arts connection is well defined.  The DVD has enough information to keep you busy for a long time, and you don't have to rush out and buy the other DVDs in this series, but I am already looking forward to continuing my training with the other DVDs, once I have mastered all of the many routines on this one.

5026073,5,B006WPDKLI,"I recently purchased this DVD and am only two+ weeks in ...  But, so far the DVD is amazing.  Dr. Yang takes his time to explain each movement, shows the movement from sometimes up to 3-4 different directions, uses poor ""Jonathan"" to demonstrate the martial arts application and explains some of the background of the movement.

The sections where you have group demonstrations and solo demonstrations are also very helpful as I am up to move 20 or so by now and seeing and practicing the movements together with the group is very key.  There is even a solo movement demonstration where Dr. Yang is filmed from behind so you can follow along as if you are in a class.

I'm sure some professional instructors might poo-poo the idea of learning this at home,  But, so far this video is tremendously enjoyable, easy to learn from, and extremely well put together.  Some significant effort went into the filming and editing of this video.  Plus, Dr. Wang is actually quite amusing some times - which makes the video easy to work with.

5026076,4,B006WPDKLI,"This teacher is excelent and goes into great detail; he's obviously a true master. The only problem is that it is very difficult to learn a physical action from a DVD, no matter how good it is. Still, he is good enough that he is able to convey the 'feeling' behind the movements so that a serious student would be able to work through the whole practice and learn it from the video given enough patience. The content of this video is actually five stars - I gave it 4 simply because of the difficulty of learning from a DVD. If you are serious about learning Tai Chi Chuan, look in local yellow pages for Tai Chi, but also Kung Fu, as Tai Chi is often taught in Kung Fu schools. Beware of martial art schools giving 'black belts' in Tai Chi Chuan, or Kung Fu, as Chinese martial arts don't have 'black belts' at all - that is a Japanese phenomenon.",1360195200,2,849,4.246913580246914

I am happy with this DVD and will keep it forever as an addition to my small library.,1359763200,4,409,3.7126436781609193

I only gave it 4 instead of 5 because sometimes when he's explaining why you do a move it's kind of hard to understand what he's saying.

5026082,5,B006WPDKLI,"This dvd is fantastic.  Dr. Wang is very thorough, going over each movement many times, from different angles and explaining each movement and its purpose.  It really is like taking a class.  I wanted a video that would actually teach me Tai Chi and this does.  I would absolutely recommend this.",1357776000,2,296,4.745098039215686
5026083,5,B006WPDKLI,This is the best beginning Tai Chi DVD I have used. Clear and concise visuals using multiple angles along with explanations for the martial application of the postures. The DVD even has subtitles even though Dr Yang is easily understood through his accent. Also his easy going nature makes him a pleasure to learn from.,1357689600,2,319,4.818181818181818
5026084,5,B006WPDKLI,I did this in the past but because I havn't done it in some years this DVD is a great way to get back into it.,1357516800,,110,3.269230769230769

5026086,5,B006WPDKLI,"Great Tai Chi production. The instructions are clear and the view is outstanding. Dr. Yang teaches as if you were right there with him, with the different views and repetitions necessary for you to follow. It takes step by step breaking down the hands and feet movements individually then in combination. Great DVD. I highly recommend this video to any one starting to learn as well as those with some experience needing to revisit the basics.",1356652800,,443,4.842105263157895
5026087,5,B006WPDKLI,It takes a little bit of practice to copy the movements in reverse as a number of them are demonstrated facing you or sideways.  Otherwise learning from this DVD is very doable.,1356566400,,177,4.53125

5026090,3,B006WPDKLI,I was so looking forward to this but it spends way to much talking about what you are going to do.  I think Dr. Yang is cute is can be.  But it needs to have a more structured program.  My spouse was thrilled about the whole idea of learning it as a form of protection.,1355097600,,269,3.8545454545454545

5026092,3,B006WPDKLI,I wanted to start Tai Chi. But I found that this video is a little frustrating. Maybe I just need a private teacher. Or maybe Tai Chi isn't my thing.,1354752000,2,149,4.0
5026093,5,B006WPDKLI,"This video is my first introduction to tai chi and I love it.  The explanations are clear and slow making the postures very easy to practice.  My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that since I purchased the streaming video, I need to make time stamps for myself if I want to practice a certain series of postures, or double check a movement, instead of there being a menu.",1354665600,4,387,4.287671232876712

5026095,3,B006WPDKLI,"First of all, the source of this video is a DVD, so we're talking standard definition here. And then the streaming quality is not that good, highly compressed. I didn't expect HD, but better quality from Amazon.",1353715200,3,211,4.72972972972973
5026096,4,B006WPDKLI,"Dr Yang did a great job explaining the steps, although I really did not care much about the martial art ""applications"" that accompanies each movement. But you could just fast forward to skip that. It was a little confusing trying to do the moves at first, because of how he is standing in front of you, and that messes up my right with his left. In the end I placed a mirror in front of the tv, and looked at Dr Yang through the mirror. That works great because it is like having your instructor facing the same direction as you are and looking at the instructor through a mirror -- just like in the gym. Overall I strongly recommend this dvd.",1353542400,8,643,4.278688524590164
5026097,5,B006WPDKLI,"I purchased this DVD after trying unsuccessfully to learn Yang Tai Chi from a book by a different author.  I found Master Yang's instruction to be very effective and engaging.  He not only shows you the form in an easy-to-follow manner, but he also explains a little of the application which, for me, makes the moves easier to understand and perform.  I have really enjoyed learning Tai Chi from this DVD and have since purchased a few more instructional DVDs with Master Yang.",1352246400,,477,4.72289156626506

5026099,5,B006WPDKLI,"I love Mr. yang style of Tai Chi and consider him a real master. The DVD is clear, serious and well made.
I recommend this DVD for any one who had already a teacher and is whiling to practice some times alone.
I use this DVD while I travel around the globe and it is very useful! Helps me a lot to be connected wit this
wonderful martial art! Mr. Yang has a very simple way to explain the exercises and shows that he is a real master!
If you never have done any Tai Chi before I recommend go first to a teacher and then use this Dvd. Thank you for Mr Yang to
share such ancient knowledge in a DVD!",1351987200,,597,3.901639344262295
5026100,5,B006WPDKLI,The DVD is clear and everything is explained well. Dr Yang Jwing-Ming is indeed a master. I haven't had it for long but I am a Tai Chi practitioner and am enjoying this DVD.,1348531200,2,173,4.117647058823529
5026101,4,B006WPDKLI,Very detailed instruction. Amazing to be able to watch a true Master preform Tai chi.  Very happy I bought this.,1347667200,2,112,4.6
5026102,5,B006WPDKLI,"I do not have a Tai Chi teacher around here so I got a video, but I have Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's book on Shaolin White Crane and saw he did a DVD on Tai Chi so it was a ""must purchase"" for me, and I am very impressed with the program. I learned a lot about martial arts that previous instructors and coaches of mine never talked about, specifically the basic but important information regarding the center of gravity and ways that it can be attacked. I bought the ""instant video"" version because I like to have all of my movies online so I can use them on my tablets, so if anyone at YMAA sees this, could you add all of the DVDs to the instant video? I will definitely buy more videos if they are available to buy and watch online.",1347408000,3,731,4.118881118881119
5026103,4,B006WPDKLI,"I am still working my way through the video but it is very well done and helpful. As a novice to Tai Chi, it is very hard to learn by just watching others. Dr. Yang not only explains the movements and shows them repeatedly, he demonstrates what the movement represents to a martial artist. It is not all of the forms but learning all of the forms takes a lot of time. When I master the forms presented, I can move on to the longer video.",1345593600,4,437,4.093023255813954
5026104,5,B006WPDKLI,"Fantastic production values + the sheer knowledge and charm of Dr Yang, Jwing Ming make this DVD a must for any student of Yang Style taijiquan. In fact would be of value to any taiji player of any style. Have ordered the accompanying book, although it's not required (the DVD is sufficient), as I am sure it will meet the same exceptional standards as the DVD. Possibly my best buy of the year!",1345420800,4,395,4.424657534246576
5026105,5,B006WPDKLI,"Very good dvd for learning Tai Chi. While nothing compares to being in a class, this dvd is wonderful if you don't have the option of attending a class. I'd recommend it to a friend. I especially liked that Dr. Yang talks about the fighting aspects of the art as it has a lot to do with why moves are the way they are. I found this helpful because it helped me to excute the moves properly.",1343779200,4,390,4.077922077922078
5026106,5,B006WPDKLI,"""Yang Tai Chi For Beginners"" is, by far, the best martial arts instructional video I have ever viewed. This is a full Yang Tai Chi course that is taught by a true master. I have taken TaeKwonDo since my early 20s but my health has significantly deteriorated over the years and can no longer take the aggressive workouts, so was thrilled to be offered the opportunity to review this video by the publisher.

Yang Tai Chi is very popular for the low impact, meditative workout and it can be performed by almost anyone. This is a truly complete DVD instructional DVD, running almost 5-hours and covering everything from the philosophy, the form movements (from several angles), and even the reason for each move, making this excellent for the beginner. The instruction is clear and straight forward, with subtitles added to augment Master Yang's fairly soft spoken words. I should mention that the inclusion of not only ""The How"" but also ""The Why"" is fascinating and really helped me understand what is being taught. The video production values are very high and is obviously professionally shot and edited.

This is an excellent Yang Tai Chi video and is a great value for this level of instruction.

Highly Recommended!

5026107,1,B006WPDKLI,"Dr Yang knows his stuff and is intelligent. However this is NOT the full form, it is a portion of the dvd series to fully explain the movements. This is not suitable for someone to learn all of the movements. It may be useful to someone that wishes to learn about tai chi. This is NOT A COMPLETE SERIES ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF IT. Fairly useless IMHO. I used to own the DVD series, and it is very good. This is a review of the streaming product.

In response to YMAA's negative response to this review:
Dear YMAA. It was NOT clear when I bought this streaming product, which is what I reviewed, that I wouldn't be able to obtain the whole of the series as a streaming product. This is not a misleading review, as it is a review of the streaming content.  What good is it if it is only part of the series?  I stand by my initial review.  Why was it not labeled as PART 1, and have part 2 and 3 available as streaming if it is useful?  I respect Dr Yang, and am quite impressed with his knowledge.  I want to make that clear also.  Why bother with this if your going to have to buy the DVD anyway? This is my gripe and it is legitimate. A total waste of money for the streaming product. I will stand by my review until the full content available on DVD is also available on streaming.  Show me you care about this and I will completely remove my review (if it is possible to do so). I have purchased products in the past from YMAA and have been very satisfied, please understand that I wish no ill feeling or misunderstanding.",1342569600,27,1524,4.142372881355932
5026108,5,B006WPDKLI,This is a great resource for someone like me that has had no experience with Tai Chi. I have enjoyed the method of instruction and how thorough the teaching methods are. After looking at several Tai Chi training resources I have found that this one is the best.,1340409600,2,261,4.458333333333333
5026109,5,B006WPDKLI,"This is a great introduction to tai chi with very thorough instructions. Like most dvds like this, I think it's best used as a supplement to taking classes in person but if that's not an option it's a good choice. I would guess that nearly half the time is spent on the martial arts applications so if that's not of interest to you you might spend a lot of time fast forwarding.",1339891200,2,378,4.263888888888889

8505788,1,B006WPDKLI,I think this is probably an excellent DVD. I watched some of Yang Jwing Ming's videos on YouTube and they looked great. So why the bad score? I couldn't get this DVD to play at all. I spent time on my laptop and desktop trying different players and nothing worked. I tried my DVD player and it failed there as well. I will be returning this. I am terribly disappointed because I really did want this DVD.,1528156800,,404,4.259740259740259
8505789,5,B006WPDKLI,"Just got it, so haven't been through it yet - still at the first step, but the information contained in the teaching is bar-none. I've learned more from the teacher's explanation of hand posture in the 10 mins it took than I learned from a year of Tai Chi elsewhere. Can't say enough good things about the level of education in this DVD. It's the long form, not the short form (at least as far as I can tell so far) as well. Yes, it's only for people who really want to understand what you're doing, but the difference between learning from a grandmaster instead of just someone who knows the moves is mind-blowing. Highly recommend it if you want to understand Tai Chi and what you're doing.",1527984000,3,692,4.4140625
8505790,5,B006WPDKLI,Very good and I enjoy it. But I do not hear very good at 80 ad wish I could understand more of what is said.,1527379200,,108,3.36

Just started,  glad I bought it.",1526083200,,42,4.25
8505792,5,B006WPDKLI,"I don't normally care for reviews that are done before the product is thoroughly used, the book completely read, etc. ""I'm on page 10 and I know I'm going to love it"", or ""The shoes just arrived today and I love them"". These don't tell you how the person felt after reading the whole book or wearing the shoes. Having said that, it may take years for me to thoroughly comprehend and make use of everything in this DVD. Its that dense with information.

So, caveats aside, I've had the DVD for several months but I'm only about 1.5 hours into this 4+ hour DVD and so far I'm very impressed. I'm only that far in because I'm trying to  master each motion before moving on to the next one, and I have limited time for practice. Dr Yang goes into great detail about how to do each move properly, but he doesn't linger so long on each one that you get bored. He shows each motion from multiple points of view, so you get a 3D view of each one. He explains the martial application of each move, and then demonstrates it with in assistant. I don't plan to do combat but I did want to learn a form of Tai Chi with martial applications, and this provides a basis for those applications. Dr Yang frequently refers to his other DVDs for those interested in learning the martial applications in depth. For now, I'm pleased just to have that inclusion for an overview. I didn't want to learn Tai Chi strictly from a ""performance"" or ""relaxation"" or Western perspective, even though improved relaxation, concentration,  muscle tone and balance are my main goals. As one reviewer said, this DVD ""isnt for the masses"". if you just want a quick superficial fix Its not for you. Its for those interested in going a little more in depth. And he says this in the DVD-if all you want is to relax and make some flowing motions, you don't need this DVD.

He can be a little hard to understand on certain words, but really not bad. Its clear even though I haven't watched the entire DVD yet that he is a true master and his teaching method is extremely thorough and grounded in traditional knowledge of Tai Chi. I couldn't be happier with it and am sure I'll be learning from it for years to come. Even if I never go any farther (I will) its a steal for 4+ hours of master instruction for under $20.",1525305600,3,2275,4.345882352941176

8505795,5,B006WPDKLI,The instruction is phenomenal! Being given the reason behind every move gives extreme clarity and permission to go at your own pace until the moves become seamless. The ONLY tiny little problem is you need a lot of room to practice. If there was just some sort of info on how to do it in the confinement of a small apartment then this would be the most amazing thing Ive ever gotten!!!!,1523664000,2,386,4.375
