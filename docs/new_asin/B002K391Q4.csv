3939644,2,B002K391Q4,"Very disappointing. I love workout DVD's and own many. This one hurt my back for days afterward because of how FAST the exercises were. It was like dancing -it was almost ridiculous trying to keep up in some of the segments. A much better kettlebell DVD is Kathy Smith's Ketllebell Solution. I was sore in all the right places, and the energy is great without the crazy dance-like swinging and back injury-inducing moves.",1322352000,5,421,4.780821917808219
3939645,5,B002K391Q4,"I love this workout.  It's a more advanced version of Michelle Khai's kettlenetics program.  This is not for the beginner, but for someone who is pretty physically fit.  Before jumping into this workout, I would suggest you purchase a beginner program, so you can learn the correct techniques for using the kettlebell.  This is a pretty tough workout.  Once through it, though, you will feel great.

One of the things I like best about Michelle Khai's workout is the fluidity involved.  She developed her program for ballet dancers, and it shows.  The Total Body Blast is a total blast.  I love every minute of it, and if you're serious about it, you will too.",1292457600,8,660,4.719298245614035
3939646,4,B002K391Q4,"the workout is tougher than you think, but the time i was done i sweating up a storm. enjoyed michelle's energy.",1278115200,4,112,4.380952380952381
8371721,3,B002K391Q4,Ouch!  Feel like I am going to hurt myself every time I try it.  I am in my 50's and work out regularly.  This workout goes too fast and the exercises don't feel safe.  Maybe a younger person would enjoy it.,1509235200,,207,3.975609756097561
8371722,5,B002K391Q4,"I don't listen to the other reviewers, saying you have to use the 8lb. kettle bell. With all the injuries I have. I learned how to listen to my body. I have used this program before achieving great results. Even went into a size 5 and then I stopped. I was doing it for all the wrong reasons. I figured if I had a sexy body my partner would become closer to me and that did not happen. Just like everything else in life you have to do it for yourself. In one month's time my stomach has muscle definition, my arms I can wave and not be embarrassed. My buttocks are lifted and my legs look like a 20 year old. I can't wait to put a before and after picture on Facebook. Who says women in there sixties can't look sexy. I am 61 and getting better each day thanks to Kettlenetics by Michelle Khai. P.S. I alternate with the 4lb & the 8lb depending on my shoulder feels.",1474416000,2,866,4.0701754385964914
8371723,5,B002K391Q4,"Wow!  Great workout!  At first I thought it would be only so-so... by the end, I was begging for mercy!  She moves very fast so use a light kettlebell (below 10 pounds!)  My arms are shaking right now and I was drenched in sweat at the end of 30 minutes.  I did jump right into this one and skipped the beginner set because I'm already doing the Kettlebody by Brook Benten (switching between the two gives great variety!)

This is an efficient workout and make sure you use an appropriate kettlebell (go lighter - and when you try it, you'll know what I mean!  I know everyone says go heavy, but this is too fast!) since this is a fusion workout!",1398988800,,646,4.289256198347108
8371724,4,B002K391Q4,I Like the Kettlenetics workout even though the DVD  was scratched and the 1 st portions dose not work I was issued a full refund when I contacted the vendor.,1384646400,,158,4.266666666666667
8371725,5,B002K391Q4,"It is a fun and easy way to workout. And at the same time, having fun workingout, you also feel that you are getting a good workout for the body at the same time.",1384473600,,162,3.7941176470588234
8371726,5,B002K391Q4,Another great workout! Goes well with the beginner kettlenetics dvd.  Fast-paced and fun! I wish there were more dvd's available.,1381017600,,129,5.45
8371727,5,B002K391Q4,I have the other kettlenetics workouts and this one really kicked my butt compared to the others....especially using the 8lb weight.  it is a fun way to workout and you feel it in every muscle of your body!,1377734400,,206,4.421052631578948
8371728,5,B002K391Q4,This is the best. I have four other dvds of her's and this is my favorite.  Gets you sweating but you still really enjoy it.  I really like Michelle's upbeat videos.,1356393600,,165,4.290322580645161
8371729,5,B002K391Q4,"This is a tough workout, and I get results to match my effort.  I have owned this dvd for about a year now, and use it about once a week (sometimes skipping a week).  It doesn't really get any easier.  Although, I remember the first few times I did this video my legs and glutes were so sore I had trouble sitting down.  I just finished my session with this dvd using the 8lbs wt, and I am covered in sweat.  During the workout I get super winded and get to that point of muscle fatigue that burns!  I love it!  Just for comparison, I borrowed Insanity from a coworker of mine earlier in the week, and have done the first 3 days of the program.  I don't think Insanity is for me, it is a little boring, but it is challenging.  I thought it would be a nice break to do this dvd instead.  Whoa, I really think that kb total body blast is more difficult, and it feels safer and more balanced for my muscles.  Not to mention that I love Michelle's upbeat positive attitude.  If you like a challenge, want serious cardio and sculpting, this will make a great addition to your collection.  I have 30+ exercise videos, and I reach for one of my three Kettlenetics videos at least once a week.

8371730,5,B002K391Q4,"I have most (if not all) of the Kettlenetics workouts, using the lighter weight kettlebell with all of them.  This one is a lot of fun and a good workout. I highly recommend starting with the basic workout that comes on Michelle's first CD to understand her form and movements.",1330732800,2,277,4.54
