7754026,1,B01G43HGWQ,I'm not sure if it's because the disc was made in Mexico or what. I opened it and saw a big scratch on the center of the disc. I watched until the end of episode 2 and the disc kept freezing and not working well with my blu ray player. I had to open and close over again to get it back on track. I don't think it's my blu Ray player becausr I've played a lot of other discs lately with no problem. Will second guess before buying from this select again. At least it was only 19.99 and prime. I'm still pretty annoyed though. I spent $19.99 and only got to watch 2 episodes of disc 1. A lovely night ruined. I've spent half hour trying to get this dvd to work. It's kind of unacceptable.,1472688000,7,686,3.9782608695652173

7754071,5,B01G43HGWQ,Dysfunction at its broadcast best. The series continues to stay top notch after being on a number of season. Nothing shocks me anymore.

7754225,3,B01G43HGWQ,Too much dwelling on the gay aspects of the show. Not as good of a balance as the British version. I like Cameron Monahan's character as joker in Gotham much more. I do appreciate the knowledge that the creaters of the show for seeing his acting abilities at such a young age. But give him some of the sanity his character Ian once had. This depraved moral version is killing the show.,1476921600,,385,4.361111111111111

7754254,5,B01G43HGWQ,"This series is amazing.
After six years , it is still consistently entertaining and always makes you wonder what will happen next.
The writers must have a hell of a time figuring out new ways to torture this poor family( not including Frank of course, he's like the devil reincarnate ;-)),either with their own mistakes or , thru no fault of their own.
Excellence ,  actors , writing direction, follow thru.
Remember though this NOT for the kids.",1475452800,2,446,4.717948717948718
