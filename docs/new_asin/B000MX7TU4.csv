8173330,4,B000MX7TU4,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD and all the singers are wonderful.  The costumes are fantastic.  The set is rather odd, but the singing and acting and costumes were so good that the set rarely detracted from the experience.  The only part I did not like was when the king was alone with Giovanna Seymour in the first DVD as he was fondling her body and it just was not what I want to see in an opera.  The scene was rather awkward and Seymour did not seem to appreciate it, which fits to the storyline, as she did not want intimate relations if they were not married, but I got the impression that the person playing Seymour (Sopia Soloviy) was uncomfortable with the situation apart form the acting of it.  It really was not necessary to convey the story.",1425686400,,759,4.392857142857143

8173332,4,B000MX7TU4,"This was certainly a moving performance. All in the cast were good to quite fine in their roles and the drama proceeded relentlessly to its ultimate tragic ending. Pasolini as Percy was unpleasant to look at(an amorphous lump) but he could and did sing very well, high C's and all. The Enrico of Zanellato was an excellent reading of the boorish, egoist King (too bad he didn't have red hair) and the Giovanna of Sofia Solovij was some of the best singing of the whole opera. She came closest to being a bel bel canto. The sets were too extreme and a dud, but the costumes were grand. The orchestra and chorus put in a fine stance under Maestro Carminati.
Now as to the Anna of Madame Dimitra. I've now seen her in four roles on DVD. In this one as in the others she puts in a moving, dramatic, emotionally packed and often terrific performance. They are often similar. She posesses a large, handsome soprano of significant depth. She has much technical prowess but it sometimes shades off if pushed and becomes painfull. She occasionally has an odd way to produce a vibrato that can become harsh. But her character never suffers and sometimes it adds a dimension to the performance. I consider her an accomplished singing actress; a truly dramatic soprano. This is not the historical bel canto of Callas, Sutherland or Sills (my favorite Anna). But it is a valid presentation of the Donizetti masterpiece.",1286064000,,1406,4.673387096774194
8173333,5,B000MX7TU4,"Gaetano Donizetti was a composer at full speed. Operas flowed one after the other, contained in your resume more than 70. The style has always remained, but when it came Belcanto, Donizetti dominated, was unbeatable. Anne Boleyn is one of the three operas he made about the Tudor queens. His last performance was given in 1881 in Livorno. Was forgotten, languishing in the archives until you get to a Greek or American talent, never to know her nationality. Maria Callas Anna Bolena unearths, with Giulietta Simionatto and direction of Luchino Visconti makes a memorable show at Scala in 1957. After her, the great dramatic sopranos realized the potential of opera, who does not want to be cheered by the final scene. Leyla Gencer, Beverly Sills, Renata Scotto, Joan Sutherland and Dimitra Theodossiou interpreted the complex character, over the decades.
There are two commercial versions available on video. The earliest was recorded in Canada in 1984 with Joan Sutherland, James Morris and Judith Forst. Baton of Richard Bonynge and Ben Heppner in early career, playing the role of Hervey.
Portrait of its time, this assembly is tradition squared. Costumes loaded, little or no scenic interpretation. Everyone Paradita, beautiful singing. Everything in its place, the light is a constant shadow. The direction is limited to tell a story, transcribes what is in the libretto faithfully and nothing more. The highlights for the voices, all the soloists are of feedback. Sutherland has great agility of a coloratura soprano, her timbre like, though his diction is weak. Baritone James Moris are legitimate, not those that currently exist, has those serious and bulky caracterticos full of singers of the past. Judith has Fosrt voice thick, enormous. The regency of my husband (of Sutherland) Boninger is classic, no innovations. The analog picture and sound are a little lacking for supporters of Blu-ray.
Anna Boleyn of Bergamo, recording made in 2006, is the opposite of Canada. His direction is impeccable, not only transcribes the lyrics, but makes a theatrical release. Provokes the viewer calls for reflection. The scenario stands possess the background, always present with members of the choir. The director's reading is clear, the life of the royals is public, no private space. The soloists do not have the same level voice of the Canadian version is in hand, they act, give realism to persongens. The light is part of the scenery, the costumes are lightweight and digital recording leaves everything in line.
Hear snakes and lizards Dimitra Theodossiou, but the soprano is based on Belcanto. Your voice can agility in difficult coloraturas, turns power and technique, but gets worn out in the end. The other soloists are guaranteed, all sing and act, that's modern opera.
Both versions show the evolution of opera. From traditional to modern reading assembly. Basic scenario of a vision, a way of telling the story, a provocation. All aspects related to production have evolved. Settings, costumes, lighting, color, movement choir, recording, direction of scenes and so on. Won the opera, which advanced in time, seeking to renew its modernized public. Recordings of the century are thought to video. But not everything is perfect, the voices of the past were higher than the present.

Portuguese:

Gaetano Donizetti era um compositor a toda velocidade. peras fluiam uma atrs da outra: constam em seu currculo mais de 70. O estlo sempre se mantinha, mas, quando o assunto era belcanto, Donizetti dominava, era imbatvel. Anna Bolena  uma das trs peras que ele fez sobre as rainhas Tudor. Sua ltima apresentao se dera em 1881, em Livorno. Ficou esquecida, mofando nos arquivos, at que aparece uma grega ou americana talentosa, nunca sei a nacionalidade dela. Maria Callas desenterra Anna Bolena, juntamente com Giulietta Simionatto e a direo de Luchino Visconti faz um espetculo memorvel no Scala, em 1957. Depois dela, os grandes sopranos perceberam o potencial dramtico da pera, quem no quer ser aplaudido pela cena final. Leyla Gencer, Beverly Sills, Renata Scotto, Joan Sutherland e Dimitra Theodossiou interpretaram a complexa personagem, no decorrer das dcadas.
Existem duas verses comerciais disponveis em vdeo. A mais antiga foi gravada no Canad, em 1984, com Joan Sutherland, James Morris e Judith Forst. Regncia de Richard Bonynge e Ben Heppner em incio de carreira, fazendo o papel de Hervey.
Retrato de sua poca, essa montagem  tradio ao quadrado. Figurinos carregados, pouca ou quase nenhuma interpretao cnica. Todo mundo paradinho, cantando bonito. Tudo no seu devido lugar, a luz  uma penumbra constante. A direo se limita a contar uma histria, transcreve o que est no libreto com fidelidade e nada mais. O destaque fica para as vozes, todos os solistas so de gabarito. Sutherland tem agilidade de um grande soprano coloratura, seu timbre agrada, entretanto sua dico deixa a desejar. James Moris  bartono legtimo, no desses que existem atualmente, tem aqueles graves cheios e volumosos caracterticos dos cantores do passado. Judith Fosrt tem voz densa, enorme. A regncia do marido (da Sutherland) Boninge  clssica, sem inovaes. A imagem e o som analgicos deixam a desejar aos adeptos do blu-ray.
A Anna Bolena de Bergamo, gravao realizada em 2006,  o oposto da canadense. Sua direo  impecvel, no transcreve apenas o libreto e sim faz uma verso teatral. Provoca o espectador, chama  reflexo. O cenrio possu arquibancadas ao fundo, sempre presentes com membros do coro. A leitura do diretor  clara, a vida dos membros da realeza  pblica, no existe espao privado. Os solistas no tm o mesmo nvel vocal da verso canadense: em contrapartida, atuam, do realismo aos persongens. A luz faz parte do cenrio, os figurinos so leves e a gravao digital deixa tudo nos conformes.
Ouvi cobras e lagartos de Dimitra Theodossiou, mas o soprano se sustenta no belcanto. Sua voz consegue a agilidade nas difceis coloraturas, despeja potncia e tcnica, mas chega desgastada no final. Os demais solistas se garantem, todos cantam e atuam , isso  pera moderna.
As duas verses mostram a evoluo da pera. De montagem tradicional a leitura moderna. De encenao bsica a uma viso, uma forma de contar a histria, uma provocao. Todos os aspectos referentes a produo evoluram. Cenrios, figurinos, luz, cores, movimentao de coro, gravao, direo de cenas e etc. Ganhou a pera, que avanou no tempo, se modernizou buscando renovar seu pblico. Gravaes do sculo XXI so pensadas para o vdeo. Mas nem tudo  perfeito, as vozes de outrora eram superiores s atuais.",1275868800,,6542,5.153628652214891
8173334,3,B000MX7TU4,"The late Turkish soprano Leyla Gencer was famous for her Donizetti roles, though she sang everything in the Italian repertoire, and then some.  In an interview conducted not long before she died, Madame Gencer said Donizetti had never received his full value, that he was a very great composer of the 19th century who needed great interpreters.  Leyla Gencer was a great interpreter of Donizetti heroines and of Anna Bolena in particular, as can be heard by listening to her performance in a radio braodcast of the opera conducted by Gianandrea Gavazzeni.  It has reissued by Allegro Records.

I mention Gencer's remarks to point out a) that not only Callas and Sutherland could sing this music and b) to beg the larger question of how a soprano can interpret music if she cannot master its technical demands or style.  Frankly, Donizetti's bones would turn over in their crypt in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo if he heard Theodossiou's labored singing, her lack of a legato line or trill, her lunging at notes, and her total lack of vocal beauty or queenly nobility. Her attempt at an E-flat at the end startled the hell out of me, but at least that meant she was finished.  I can't really add to the first reviewer's highly knowledgeable analysis of Theodossiou's vocal problems except to wonder why he thinks this DVD is wothwhile.

I thought the only performer who had any sense of Donizetti's and Romani's intentions was the tenor Gianluca Pasolini.  He sang Percy's music with focus and true elegaic feeling, including an aria that is usually cut. And as for the staging:  can't directors think of anything more imaginative way of handling the chorus than putting them in metal risers?  They look like they're sitting in bleachers waiting for the ballgame to begin! Please do yourself---and Donizetti--- a favor and buy the recordings with Callas or Gencer or the DVD with Sutherland with a better supporting cast and a fine traditional production by Lofti Mansouri.",1244332800,4,1990,4.895833333333333
8173335,5,B000MX7TU4,"I loved this opera!  The entire cast was fabulous, including the chorus.  Dimitra Theodossiou's performance as Anna Bolena was inspired; her range of singing, straight from heaven or the depths of hell.  Sofia Soloviy's voice was equally beautiful and seemed effortless.  The tenor Gianluca Pasolini as Percy sang with great passion and Riccardo Zanellato as Enrico was a sumptuous villain.  The ensemble singing was glorious!

I thought the beautiful music and excellent singing carried the production past any deficit of staging or theatrics:  The set was rather stark with riser seats in the background where members of the court sat watching, witnessing events during the entire opera.  But, what better way to make the point that nothing at court is secret; that everyone knows what is happening?

I really enjoyed this production and recommend it without reservation.",1192924800,12,873,5.313868613138686

Surprisingly, the news is better than one might expect

here. This is a fairly straightforward but not sensational

performance. All things considered, that is a better than

usual summation in the achievement of a very difficult

opera - which, sad to say, rarely receives even an adequate

performance across the casting board. With Theodossiou

heading the honors, there are still no genuine stars of the

brilliant-international-news-headlines variety; but most

relievedly, no clunker-flops in any role.

When I first saw the set, my heart sank; it consists of a

section of stadium-colisseum grid seats, which overlook the

action of the proceedings. The chorus spends a lot of time

inertly in these seats, and some of the cast hover around

there as well. Go figure. The costumes, however, are

generally of the era, and are sumptuous, rich, and serve

the drama and period. Thankfully, the action is fairly well

done, and after awhile, you forget the sets and are able to

focus on the drama. There is some effective blocking

throughout, and at least the cast is made to interact in a

reasonably natural and dramatically bent fashion.

There are numerous cuts. Anna's first cabaletta is shorn to

one verse, and there are trims throughout, with still a

running time of 3 hours. An uncut ANNA BOLENA with

intermission should be a nearly 4-hour evening. I can

understand some of the cuts; it's a long opera, and not all

of the music is first rate. But then again, ideally trained

singers could probably make you forget this. I long to

hear in a real performance that maggiore section in the

second act Anna/Percy/Enrico trio, where there are some

beautifully etched figurations by Enrico. And some of

Anna's more florid lines in the duet with Giovanna are

excised. Hard to figure if tradition plays a part in these

stubbornly enduring cuts, or if, because of their

difficulty, is out of consideration for the limitations of

the singers. Maybe a bit of both. None of the singers here

are what you would call true stylists of the era, having

neither the ideal flexibility nor the precise flair for

this kind of music, but neither do they disgrace it. It is

managed, sometimes neatly (but only just), but not with the

utmost in savoir faire.

(Dynamic, by the way, put out a few years ago on CD of a

live performance of this opera starring Theodossiou that

was absolutely complete; what a pity that performance was

not captured for release on DVD - and Theodossiou was in

better form)

Riccardo Zanellato (who, as Oroveso, appeared with

Theodossiou in the Dynamic DVD release of NORMA) certainly

looks the part of Enrico; he's a big, burly guy who moves

and acts well, and has the physicality to appear imposing.

 The voice itself is soft-grained, no rough edges, but

lacks the incisive thrust, and the ability to ""blacken""

certain phrases. You get though, his attraction to

Giovanna, and he takes care to indicate his lust for her.

Giovanna is appealingly portrayed by Sofia Soloviy.

The booklet does not state what her

voice is, but it sounds like a soprano to me. And it is

good to hear a real soprano in the role as intended;

Soliviy has a refreshing youthful brightness instead of the

usual plummy timbre. The ""Per questa fiamma"" is handled

well, and she and Zanellato manage to put some life into

their not-too distinguished scenes together. Soliviy as an

actress is not always fully responsive to Giovanna's

burning anguish and dilemma, but she is nevertheless, an

attentive, appealing presence.

Gian Luigi Pasolini as Percy is the typical stocky-podgy

 tenor of the Gigli-Poggi stature, but I liked his warm,

pliant tone and sensitivity to the music. No blaring, no

bleating, a little narrow on top sometimes, but taking care

to at least modulating the volume. ""Vivi tu"" is sung with

admirable restraint, with an eloquent phrase here and

there, but did not produce magic. The cabaletta is

delivered with some panache, and Pasolini at least did not

strangle himself. Involved in his performance, not

arrestingly, but seemed to listen to the other characters

and managing to show some strength of being.

The Smeton is listed as one Jos Maria Lo Monaco -

the tone is a bit hooty, opaque, and the two solos nothing

to write home about.

Dimitra Theodossiou in the title role gives a star's

performance. She is at once an artist of stature, and, all

told, is an immensely appealing presence. Theo looks

splendid, royal, dignified and commanding in her costumes;

she at times looks uncannily like the young Callas in the

midst of The Big Weight loss. Theo has marvelous large

eyes, a wide, expressive face, and dark, sultry looks, all

used to great effect - she looks like a classical actress

of the stage. Her Anna is often deeply sympathetic, is

vividly alive to all the facets of the character's persona

and situation. Theo's phrasing is in many instances

wonderfully sensitive, thoughtful, and at a few notable

points, positively electrifying. The voice's natural

bearing has some substance, and she works very

conscientiously toward a sense of the music's style. There

is no question that Theodossiou is far more imaginative,

lively, and memorable than Sutherland, who is the Anna on

the only other available commercial video release (On VAI

DVD).

However, Theo must yield completely to Sutherland in terms

of ease of vocal production and technique, Callas in both

technique and sublimity of utterance.

I fear Theo's voice may be beginning to come apart at the

seams. Her vocal state has deteriorated since her

audio-only commercial release of Anna. I noticed a few

reasons as to possibly why. Theo seems to manufacture her

tone quite frequently in the front part of her jaw, where

she lets it quiver to produce a vibrato that sounds pushed

instead of floated at the ends of phrases; other times her

jaw looks stiff from pushing the tone resolutely instead of

sailing it out. She can sing softly at times, but either a

spin or a float can go awry when she pushes. The core, or

the mittelage, has narrowed, so that the former cushiness

is dwindling. A lot of the top notes are throttled with all

her might. Sometimes the chest voice will ring out

strongly, but other times (as in her Norma) it will be

opaque and weak, with distorted vowels. Theo is plainly in

pursuit of the Callas model (though I hear she has borrowed

some of Gruberova's points of phrasing, especially in some

of the unwritten upward extensions).

(And, BTW - there are two distinct Anna interpretations, if

I could use two portrayals from the movie ""Anne of the

Thousand Days"" - there is the Genevieve Bujold Anne, the

young, girlish bride of the King. Then there is Irene

Papas' deeply tragic Catherine of Aragon, who seems more

like a real Queen. Callas's Anna is more like Irene Papas'

Catherine of Aragon. Sills, Gruberova, Devia, et al is the

Bujold Anna. Theodossiou is clearly after the Papas type

of Anna. But it may be safe to say that Callas is perhaps

the only Anna to reach the levels of, and match

descriptions of Pasta's portrayal. Gencer came somewhat

within distance of the Callas model, but my personal

opinion is that it was idiosyncratic.)

Alas, though, once one has heard Callas's live 1957 Scala

broadcast, and the final scene from her ""Mad Scenes""

recital, one cannot consider Theo - for all her commitment

and uniqueness - to be in her predecessor's league. For

one thing, Callas had a bewitching timbre and singularity

of expression that was tailor-made for Anna. The magical

suspension of phrases, the natural, queenly sovereignty of

the line, the sheer identification and ability to produce

the classic Donizetti style - is not reproducable. And

Callas, even in her worst state of voice, could still

produce the nimble, springy pearls of passagework, whereas

Theo sounds clumsy, stiff and inadequately schooled.

Individual notes on Theo's performance. ""Come, innocente

giovane"" is taken very slowly, quietly, nicely melancholic.

The cabaletta, shorn to one verse, is labored, the highest

tones shrieky.

Theo is at her very best in the duet with Percy, leading

into the first act finale. Her desperation is explicit,

and the ""Giudici, ad Anna? Giudici!"" is deeply outraged;

her launch into the cabaletta ""Ah! segnata e la mia sorte""

is hair raising, flashing with scorn, with full-throttle

singing, and wait till you hear her prolonged, whoppingly

loud high D. It finishes off very nearly a yelp, but her

seizing attack is terribly exciting nonetheless. She's

throwing full caution to the wind, and it's a great moment

of abandon.

Duet with Giovanna fine, nothing like Callas and Simionato

though (yes comparisons are odious, but that was one of the

great nights in Scala's history that was documented)

The Mad Scene. Very touching actually, the recit quite

expressive. Of ""Al dolce guidami"" Theo knows what to do

with it, the pathetic accents are there, and her

application is as ideal as the piece calls for, but the

breath control (phrases get broken up) and the requisite

needed float is regrettably lacking. She aims for the

trills, which is good, but they're vague flutters. The

""Cielo a'miei lunghi spasimi"" is beautiful, poignant and

meditative. ""Manca solo a compire il delitto"" short on

power. ""Coppia iniqua"" sung with tremendous zest and punch,

the rising trills again not very clear, the passagework

clumsily executed. Theo drops a few words near the end -

or seems to forget and fumble? - and belts out a very

loud, lunged E flat - and this really does end in a yelp.

 It takes you by surprise, it almost seems thrown in.

Theodossiou by her indefatigable energy, desire to succeed,

and that unobtainable commodity called charisma, makes this

performance work on its own terms. You'll have to decide

whether her valiant efforts makes up for some shortfalls of

vocal results. I would not consider it any kind of

landmark achievement but any means, but it's an interesting

document - and one of the ways to watch a performance of

the opera if you've never seen it.",1178323200,26,10581,4.935963407661521
