Enjoy!",1485388800,,119,5.315789473684211

8560800,5,B000Y9AO80,"This is one of the silliest, stupidest, funnest movies ever. It it part of the Great Asian sub-genre of Kung fu-comedy-horror, like Spooky Encounters or Shadow Boxing. Does anyone love hopping Vampires? There is something in this movie for everyone. First there is Billy Chong, fantastic Martial Artist and great actor. There's lots of great action and stupid mayhem. If you want to be scared avoid this movie, because it is totally irreverent and totally asian. This movie was made at about the same time Billy Chong Made Kung Fu Zombie, which is also silly and highly recommended. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you probably will soil yourself.",1258329600,3,644,4.972222222222222
