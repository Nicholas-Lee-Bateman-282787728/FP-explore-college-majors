8568519,4,B00BHJ4SOW,"This was the first of 2 films he made in Rome along with Meng Hoi and Shirley Corrigan. The other was (Kidnap in Rome), which is also worth viewing and keeping. Both films were directed by the great Ng See Yuen and feature Liang's trade mark sky high kicks and lightning fists! In this movie he is sent to Rome from Hong Kong to star in a film however under a sinister plot to have him rubbed out by the main villain played by Consalvo Dell'arti (Carrol) who has 3 sons (Mario Cutini) being his only natural one plus 2 adopted sons played by Gordon Mitchell and Shoji Kurata. The remainder of the cast is predominantly made up of Italian actors much like Kidnap in Rome. Both Liang and Kurata have a duel towards the end resulting in long street chases including a steep snow covered hill. The ending was a bit of a shocker. For vintage Bruce Liang fans, this should be in your collection. This man in his prime had the speed and kicking height to rival anyone from the golden era of kung fu cinema. Although in terms of overall fighting prowess I would rate him a notch below such notables as Hwang Jang Lee and Grandmaster Hwang Ing Sik (who thoroughly whipped Billy Chong in Fistful of Talons).",1398470400,,1197,4.396396396396397
