8755671,5,B01DEAH9SI,"Gorgeous, Bold, Flamboyant, Graceful, Exotic, Classic, Modern, Sensual, Captivating are just a few of the adjectives I can use for these 4 ballets (also perfectly executed)! My favorites were Viscera and Carmen which was not only fabulous but very very sensual.  Any ballet lover will be entranced and enchanted with them from their fragility to passion and beyond.  I couldn't stop watching!  Wonderful choreography, perfectly performed with both intensity and sensitivity!",1485648000,,474,5.647887323943662
8755672,5,B01DEAH9SI,"Viscera is modern dance very structured so that the emotional connection for the dancers is cancelled out. Afternoon of a Faun is a gentle beautiful dance of loneliness and love. It may be a dream, or a lost love, or the awakening to a new love. The Pas De Deux appeals to the romantic nature of love.  Carmen is a new and different take on the well-known story.  Sultry and sexy it combines traditional ballet with dance and song from Spain.",1484092800,,442,4.444444444444445
8755673,5,B01DEAH9SI,"This disc, recorded on November 12 2015, contains four very contrasting ballets set to equally contrasting music. The recording values uphold expectations of the label giving excellent sound (DTS surround and stereo), vision and camera work. Sound is enhanced by a replay level of about 6 dB more than normal levels and this achieves a proper impact.

There are four short extras of approximately 4-5 minutes. These are a delightful resume interview between Acosta and Darcy Bussell, Acostas farewell speech which is also at the end of the full programme, Acostas illustrated resume of his production of Carmen and Scarletts illustrated resume of his Viscera ballet. Scarletts description of this ballet repeatedly refers to it being visceral which, rather confusingly, runs counter to the meaning of viscera. There are two meanings of visceral, one being of / or affecting the viscera (for viscera see below), and the other meaning characterised by instinct rather than intellect (Collins dictionary).

The ballets themselves range from small scale pas de deux to far larger ensembles including choral and musical ensembles extending beyond the traditional dancers and orchestra.  The booklet provides basic casting and other production details plus a short article which gives some insight into the four ballets in turn. The following will give those who are more inquisitive or enquiring after some additional detail that might prove helpful.

The opening ballet by Liam Scarlett is set to Lowell Liebermanns Piano Concerto 1 and has the title Viscera. This is described in the booklet notes as an abstract ballet in deep purple and reds.' The outer movements are described as propulsive and the central movement as ghostly and hypnotic.  The central music is a pas de deux while the contrasting outer movements feature the whole corps de ballet amongst which a lone female figure who tears through  . amid the corps de ballet, a whirlwind of swift steps.

The chosen title of this ballet is Viscera which is a word which means The interior organs in the great cavities of the body (e.g. brain, heart, liver) esp. in the abdomen (Oxford Dictionary). The title might therefore have something to do with the chosen colour scheme but its title relevance is otherwise not clear. This confusion is not enlightened by Scarletts repeated use of visceral in his extra section description (see above). However, the music is well chosen being similarly without obvious form while not being disagreeable. The composer, Lowell Liebermann born 1961, favours writing music that combines elements of traditional tonality and structure with more adventurous harmonies .. often polytonal . and exploring different bitonal possibilities. (Internet sources).

The dancing itself is expertly delivered by the corps de ballet as is the contrasting central pas de deux although, arguably, only the music conveys the sense of it being ghostly in effect. The dancing could perhaps be seen as hypnotic though.

The following Afternoon of a Faun, set to music of that name by Debussy in 1894, was premiered in 1953. This has nothing to do with the composers original intention of musically portraying the daydreams of a faun in the summer heat. That original concept, portrayed in ballet form by Nijinsky in 1912, led to violent public demonstrations and objections in the press on the basis that animals should not have such thoughts, clearly sensuous in nature.

This 1953 version is an engrossing pas de deux delivered self-possessedly (narcissistic ballet dancers  sleeve notes) by Sarah Lamb and Vadim Muntagirov. The scene is set in a ballet studio with practice mirror set (in imagination) between the individual dancers and the audience. Consequently the visual communication is directly between the dancers and the audience and this visual obsession is maintained even when the dancers are physically working together. This lack of communication between the dancers with an apparent concentration entirely upon themselves as communicated directly to the audience is both engrossing and effective.

The Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux by Balanchine dates from 1960 and is an abstract ballet set to extra music, written but not included, in the composers Swan Lake ballet score. This takes the traditional format of a slow shared pas de deux followed by two quick solo sections to display each dancer in turn and concluding with a shared pas de deux, also of a display nature. This format is a very familiar one and is easy to follow as the intention is one of traditional display within a traditional ballet as found in many final acts.

The dancing by both Lana Salenko and Steven McRae leads to prolonged and highly enthusiastic applause taking a fair amount up of the total ballet playing time! No-one is likely to find either the ballet or the audience response in any way objectionable although it was probably wise of the composer to leave the music on the shelf in reserve as it lacks the notable melodic distinction of the rest of Swan Lake as we know it.

By far the largest ballet, measured in any terms, is the recent Carmen ballet choreographed by Acosta and premiered in 2015 to music by Bizet (Carmen opera and LArlesienne) but significantly arranged and orchestrated by Martin Yates. It also includes 9 guitarists, stage percussionists, plus choral and solo vocal contributions. The dancing cast is equally extensive. This is a major work and follows the operatic version of the story pretty closely thus ensuring a compelling and familiar narrative.

Although Acosta and Nunez clearly take the lions share of the work there is much for everyone else to perform with strong corporate and individual roles for both male and female dancers. The musical arrangements by Martin Yates are expert and highly effective and produce a superb backdrop for a compelling ballet that digs imaginatively into a wide range of genres.  This is a major achievement. As it involves such a wealth of talent it would take a huge and disproportionate amount of review space to deal with each element adequately, so suffice it to say that the whole amounts to even more than the whole and creates a true climax to the entire evening

.. except ..

Carlos Acostas final farewell speech to both his colleagues and the audience. This, without notes, was as flawless as has been his dancing giving due praise to all, advice to rising dancers and thanks to those many who had contributed to the success of his 17 years with the Royal Ballet  years that passed, as he said, like a blink of an eye.  Such a farewell speech appropriately concluded a fine example of both his and the Royal Ballets art.

This was a real gala night to remember and one to replay time and time again.",1473811200,4,6742,5.039532794249776
8755674,4,B01DEAH9SI,"Nicely done, although Viscera is not on my favorite list and the Carmen was a bit disappointing.  The Tchaik PDD and the Faun were perfectly fine.",1468800000,3,146,4.615384615384615
