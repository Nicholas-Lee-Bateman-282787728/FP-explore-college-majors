8157801,5,B000KKNLYW,"Footrot Flats says a lot about New Zealand and Australia. It is not about our Americanised youth and not popular culture. This cartoon movie feels right in that it very well tells about people on ""the land"", resilient people and farmers. While I have been a big anime fan and far side fan, this is my favorite all time comic.",1223942400,4,325,4.433333333333334
8157802,5,B000KKNLYW,"Footrot Flats whether in cartoon or comic form is a classic piece of New Zealand and Australia humour. A must for anyone, particularly if your best mate is a dog. Great for belly aching laughs.",1188259200,4,193,4.542857142857143
