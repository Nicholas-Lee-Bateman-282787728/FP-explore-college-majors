2168950,4,B00065GVIO,"He Knew He Was Right based on the Anthony Trollope novel has many of the makings of a period drama success--beautiful sets and costumes, good actors, and a script written by the wonderful Andrew Davies, who also penned the BBC's miraculous 1996 miniseries Pride and Prejudice.

However, despite these wonderful attributes, He Knew He Was Right still lacks in something. To me, the main storyline is the problem: Louis Trevalyan is deeply suspicious and hurt by what he feels is impropriety in the older Colonel Osborne's relationship with his wife Emily. The entire movie consists of him demanding that Emily stop receiving Osborne and Emily's staunch refusal because of her innocence; if she were to stop seeing him it would imply that something improper had indeed occurred. This is all right for the first few minutes, but after a while the situation continued to drag on and I was beginning to get quite frustrated. I found myself waiting for the secondary storylines to begin as they were more interesting. To make matters worse, the actors in several instances told their thoughts to the camera in a sort of soliloquy.

I'm not telling anyone to rule He Knew He Was Right out, as there are some good scenes and gorgeous costumes, but do not expect it to be along the lines of P&P or North and South.",1150329600,7,1305,4.769911504424779
2168951,2,B00065GVIO,"I am a BBC devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic BBC storytelling and visual feasting.  However, I was only partially correct.  It is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly. I left the film feeling robbed, disappointed, sad, and a bit unfulfilled.  I viewed it only once and then sold it on e-bay at a cut-rate price.

Do yourself a favor and save your time and money.",1124928000,21,489,4.586206896551724
2168952,3,B00065GVIO,"I am a great fan of BBC's adaptions from Victorian literature.  However, ""He Knew He Was Right"" stuck an off note with me.  The portrait of a shipwrecked marriage rang true in the beginning. The jealously combined with the need to be right rang true, but I found the husband's physical and mental dissolution difficult to understand.  Upon reflection, I suppose he was suffering from an advanced case of depression: a malady that is not often associated with the Victorians. It was a relief to everyone when he finally expired with same melancholy vapidity with which he lived.

The characters in this production bordered more on characture than fully developed characters. The young wife's independence was sketched and suggested by the fact she went barefoot and played ball prior to her marriage, and her so-called independence of spirit only surfaces with her insistence on receiving daily visits from her god-father. This was less the exercise of feminine rights than exercise of tolerance for a dead bore in a well tied neckcloth.

The remaining characters fell further yet into the realm of cartoon: especially the American heiress who had nothing more to her credit then long leg bones, a hank of red hair and the flat accent attributed to wealthy Yankee women.

There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but there are also a lot better ways to spend the same number of hours: Barchester Towers is a better production by far.",1111708800,37,1440,4.881147540983607
2168953,5,B00065GVIO,"The BBC have done it yet again; they have  taken us back in time in a marvellously convincing manner. It is difficult to find fault with any aspect of this production. Settings, locations, constumes and casting are all near perfect and the acting throughout is admirable. From the beginning to the end my attention never flagged for a moment; it was so jam-packed with human interest that I couldn't have enough of it. This is not a melodrama as some have said; taking into account the mores of the time it is totally realistic with nothing over-played. Yes, it was annoying that the central character should allow his happy marriage to be destroyed by unfounded jealousy and a bit difficult to accept until you remember that this wasn't his only source of complaint; he was also annoyed that his spirited wife should refuse to submit to his unreasonable demands, something which as a Victorian husband he felt he had a right to expect. And she was not altogether blameless; she didn't have to behave in such a flirtatious way as to excite her husands jealousy. Or to seem  to  enjoy so much the frequent visits of her philandering God-father. However, the film was not all focused on the anger and strife of the two central characters; it was enlivened by two other love stories that end happily. With so many characters so well realized, well acted and convincing, I was left wanting more - much more.",1110412800,30,1403,4.695121951219512
2168954,4,B00065GVIO,"Once again BBC & screen writer Andrew Davies get it right with a classic adaptation, this time from Anthony Trollope's Victorian novel, ""He Knew He Was Right.""  An innocent wife, a jealous husband, a notorious ladies man, an indecisive vicar, a pair of ""French"" sisters, a lowly born but lovely girl, an elderly aunt, a consummate gentleman, a poor journalist, a private detective, an American lady, and a woman in love.  These are the main characters that make up one of Anthony Trollope's greatest novels, aptly named ""He Knew He Was Right.""

When Louis Trevelyan (Oliver Dimsdale) meets Emily Rowley (Laura Fraser), daughter of Sir Marmaduke Rowley (the island's governor), on a trip to the Mandarin Islands, he falls madly in love: Emily and her parents consent to a marriage (she has some say: after all, she has been raised in the free ways of the tropics).  They marry, honeymoon, and even have a child in a first few years of complete and utter bliss in London, with Emily's sister Nora in accompaniment. All is fine until insecure Louis begins to suspect that Emily is having an affair with old family friend and her godfather, Colonel Osborne (Bill Nighy), a notorious ladies man who has a penchant for married women.  Emily has received him alone in her London home (she is unaware of the dangers of London society, being both beautiful and independent), and gossip begins to circulate that something is going on there.  When Louis confronts Emily she denies that anything is going on or has ever happened.  He forbids her to ever see Osborne again and she refuses: she professes her complete innocence and her complete love of Louis, but does not see why she should promise not to see Osborne and in so doing admit wrong.  Louis is angry and doesn't believe her: he thinks she's lying, covering up, shameful and deceitful...he would forgive her, but only if she admitted she had done him wrong.  Emily refuses.

Other characters are introduced, as Emily and Nora are sent by Louis to live with his best friend Hugh's mother Mrs. Stanbury and his sister Priscilla.  Mrs. Stanbury is widow of the late vicar, with daughters Priscilla and Martha (who is later sent to live with her elderly rich Aunt Stanbury), and son Hugh. Others include: Camilla and Arabella French, who both wish to marry the local minister, Reverend Gibson; Hugh Stanmore, a poor journalist and Louis' best friend; Charles Glascock, a soon-to-be titled gentleman who has fallen for a certain lady; Brooke Burgess, Aunt Stanbury's heir who falls for a woman himself; Caroline and Olivia Spalding, adventuresome sisters from America; and last but not least, a sleazy private detective named Bozzle.  All these and more create a volatile setting for a few different love triangles of ultimate rejection, supposed ""betrayal,"" and true love.

Content:  There is much spoken of in the way of a supposed affair between a married woman and an unmarried man: there is never anything shown.  There is no objectionable language that I can recall.  There is some vacillating of people between who they will marry, and a not-quite flattering portrayal of a local minister.  A little boy is kidnapped, a young lady defies her parents to marry, a woman threatens violence to others when she doesn't get her way (she will stab them all; a slight tussle occurs at one point), engagement made and broken are tossed left and right.  A man is driven to madness and despair by his own imagination.

Louis spends the entire time, obsessed with the idea that Emily has committed adultery with Colonel Osborne: he lets it take over his thoughts, his actions, his health and his life in general.  But when all is said and done and the dust finally settles on this play of life, will Louis finally believe his lovely wife Emily is as innocent as she claims?  You may wonder what ultimately happens...after all, HE knew HE was right...",1109721600,79,3889,4.835595776772247
2168955,4,B00065GVIO,"For an author as majestic and as prolific as Trollope, locating his ""best"" book is a challenge. But He Knew He Was Right would certainly be at the top of my list. The novel has several of his most lovingly drawn main characters, two beautifully intersecting plot lines, numerous minor characters that refuse to remain minor, and a story that makes the reader scream ""No, no! Don't do it!""

It is also a typically mammoth book, where conversations go on for pages, descriptions are elaborate and detailed, and numerous authorial asides punctuate gloriously. So, how to compress this sprawling monstrosity into three hours? Well, I wouldn't have thought it possible, but Andrew Davies pulls it off. As exquisite as the novel? Not possible! No snack, no matter how tasty, can replace a multi-course meal elegantly served. But it ain't bad, ain't bad at all....

The cast is almost flawless. Laura Fraser, nearly perfect in the unseen Whatever Happened to Harold Smith? shines again as Emily, a headstrong girl whose inner conflict between submissive love and stubborn pride is beautifully rendered. Though the title is He, the story is about She, and we never lose sight of how much she suffers. Her family is wonderfully done, other than her sister Nora, who is hard to see as a worthy catch in any way. But the smaller characters, all deftly drawn by Trollope, shine wonderfully here. Colonel Osborne, the slightly creepy but pompously self-justifying blowhard, slinks across every scene he's in. Mr. Outhouse, seen for a few minutes only, inhabits his poor, honest and overwhelmed clergyman perfectly. The French sisters, and Mr. Gibson, three of the most odious scraps of humanity ever created by Trollope, are delectably portrayed. But no one drags this down.

The photography is excellent, the huge cast of characters is handled admirably, the sets and clothes all reek of authenticity. A very good condensation of a great novel, this provides many pleasures to the fan of Trollope and a worthy introduction to the novice.",1105920000,101,2025,5.020833333333333

I also thought that the story line was remarkable. I didn't expect it to end the way that it did, although I guess it really made you see how this one man's obsession with being right, caused him to grieve over something that had only occurred in his mind. I thought the acting was superb! Every cast member had a role to play and played it to the end! I also liked the integrity displayed by Nora. Although she wasn't sure if the man that she loved would return her feelings, she held on to her integrity and turned down a marriage proposal from a man who was truly handsome and very wealthy. I also loved the feisty Aunt who always spoke her mind! The funniest  part was the two sisters who fought relentlessly over the preacher! He didn't really want to marry either one, but he finally chose the more quieter of the two.

Upper English society makes Park Ave society look and sound like an AA meeting in Harlem. The upper English simply have mastered civility...and always a point to all they say and do. It's not a movie for thrill seekers or instant gratification seekers....upper class English society just doesn't do. This script and its brillant actors will make you laugh, cry and bewildered at the same time. And Bill Nighy, well, he doesn't know how to deliver less than a brilliant performance.

2169054,4,B00065GVIO,"""He Knew He Was Right"" was a four-hour television miniseries from 2004 that dramatized the Anthony Trollope novel of the same name (published in 1869). I read the novel just prior to watching the series. True to novel, the series involves the tragedy that befalls a husband and wife due to the husband's jealousy and the wife's immature stubbornness. Anthony Trollope considered this novel to be a failure. I must confess: it is my least favorite Trollope novel. Therefore, while I admire this film adaptation for being true to the novel, for me, the story is too unpleasant to rate five stars.

The series is well cast. I particularly enjoyed the performances of the lovely Laura Fraser (as Emily Trevelyan) and the always-entertaining Bill Nighy (as the home-wrecking Colonel Osborne). Doctor Who (that is to say, David Tennant) even makes an appearance as Rev. Gibson.

2169055,5,B00065GVIO,"Another of those fine BBC miniseries of classical literature, this one by Anthony Trollope. I have it in my library, but either I have not read it yet or this is so different that I don't remember having read it. In any case, there are some four or five (maybe six) couples that make up their own sorts of romance.

There is Louis Trevelyan (Oliver Dimsdale) and his beautiful wife Emily (Laura Fraser), who love one another dearly. But his irrational jealousy of her receiving visits from her father's best friend and her godfather drive Louis insane. They end up in an endless tug of war over their adorable son, Little Louis.

Then there's Nora Rowley (Christina Cole), Emily's sister, who is courted by a wealthy lord, but loves a journalist who is her brother-in-law's best friend.

There are the French sisters, Camilla (Claudie Blakeley) and Arabella (Fenella Woolgar), who have both set their caps for the local vicar, Mr. Gibson (David Tennant). He doesn't actually want to marry either one, but . . . it gets complicated.

Then there is wealthy old Miss Stanbury (Anna Massey), who just cannot help interfering between her niece Dorothy and her nephew (on the other side) Hugh, although she does not explain why until near the end.

It's a serious movie, really, but as with all Trollope stories, there are lovely touches of humor. One of my favorites is that characters frequently turn to the camera and talk to the audience about what they are thinking, a clever device that gets around the fact that Trollope's books tend to have a lot of this internal dialog in them which does not normally translate well to the screen.

I started out giving it 4 stars, but added one as I wrote this review. It was really very good.",1336694400,,1731,4.677631578947368
2169056,3,B00065GVIO,"Henry James commented that Trollope's main gift was his ability to create real, fully realized characters. Trollope himself wrote that his strength was his characters, with whom he lived, breathed and slept during the composition of his novels. Some of Trollope's gift and strength is at evidence in this BBC adaptation. Unfortunately, it appears mostly in the subplots and minor characters rather than the principals.  The main story of the marriage of Louis Trevelyn and Emily is far and away the weakest part of the film. Oliver Dimsdale simply isn't very interesting as the obsessively jealous husband, and the reason for his jealousy (of course, it isn't rational), and its disasterous consequences, is never very persuasive or compelling.  Similarly, while Laura Fraser is incomparably lovely as Emily, her character's stubborness and failure to understand or compromise with her increasingly deranged husband (while the two remain much in love, apparently) is equally incomprehensible. Similarly, while Bill Nighy is quite good as the dastardly Colonel Osborne, who is all too willing to undermine others' relationships or marriages for the sake of appearing a ""man about town,"" if nothing more, we don't really see quite enough of him to understand or appreciate exactly what he is up to. Even his confrontation with Emily's father, Sir Marmaduke Rowley, is a bit of a disappointment.  Although there is a great deal interesting in the conflict of perception and reputation and the exercise of one's independent will and judgement, the main story falls flat.  I had a hard time developing much feeling or sympathy for the main characters, and their plight and Louis's decline was less than fascinating.
On the other hand, the subplots are marvellous. The best by far is David Tennant as Reverend Gibson who can't quite decide which of two sisters, if either, he should marry and who feels so obviously persecuted for his own indecisiveness. Similarly, Aunt Stansbury is a marvellous character who has the distinctly un-Victorian ability (at least as evidenced by fiction) to change, realize and even admit when she has made blunders of judgement, first as to emily and Colonel Osborne, then as to her niece Martha whose marriage she touchingly condones with the observations (""What do I care what anyone thinks of me after I'm dead?""). And of course there is the wonderful detective (or private man) Bozzle, and Mrs. Bozzle, with their on-going dialogue about what is practical (and profitable) and what is morally right.
The production values are notably high, and there are certainly wonderful moments and very good performances throughout. The story also manages to paint a broad canvass on the subject of relationships, courtship, money, position and society.  Unfortunately, the main storyline and Dimsdale as Louis leave the entire production a disappointment, with too many hollow and predictable moments and a main character we do not like and with whom we cannot sympathize.  The production is fully worth seeing, but do not expect the best of the BBC tradition of successfully adapting Victorian fiction.  Then again, this is Trollope, who is always solid, but rarely brilliant. Perhaps that is the best description of the series, David Tennant aside.",1330041600,,3269,5.227099236641221
2169057,5,B00065GVIO,"Louie (Oliver Dimsdale) thinks his wife Emily is cheating on him with a well-known womanizer, Colonel Osbourne (played by the always excellent and chameleon-like Bill Nighy), but the fault lies between all three of them:  Emily for going against her husband's wishes not to correspond or visit with him regardless of doing nothing wrong, Osbourne for getting a thrill out of causing trouble, and Louie who listened to the questionable detective he hired.  The results of this main story are tragic, but there are also some wonderful subplots going on.

Emily's sister Nora is in love with Louie's penniless author friend, much to her father's dismay, and their cousin Dorothy lives with an aunt who often seems disagreeable but only has the best of intentions for her, and let's not forget clergyman Gibson who has two sisters fighting over him regardless of the fact he's shown what a fickle and roving eye he has.  It is a classic and somewhat timeless story of relationships between the sexes and family that proves wardrobe styles and technology have changed, but never the essence of the human heart.

A lot of period films I've seen have been so slow and boring it was hard to keep interest, but the four hours I invested in this one were a joy and kept me glued to the TV.

If the story had gone the way I wanted it to go, it would have been over in 5 minutes and would have been boring. This was much better.

2169073,4,B00065GVIO,"I've yet to read Anthony Trollope's novel upon which this BBC period drama is based, but I have to admit I liked this production. The screenplay by Andrew Davies (who also wrote the screenplay for 1995's Pride and Prejudice) is brilliant, capturing the rapid deterioration of a once loving marriage. Louis Trevelyan (Oliver Dimsdale) is a wealthy young man who falls in love with and marries beautiful and strong-willed Emily Rowley (Laura Fraser). The couple enjoy a happy marriage until Col. Osborne (Bill Nighy), a close friend of Emily's father rudely intrudes upon their marital bliss. Osborne has a reputation for being immoral and Trevelyan hears gossip about his wife and the Colonel which leads him to doubt Emily's faithfulness. Things deteriorate rapidly, especially when Trevelyan's entreaties to his wife not to see the Col. is met with defiance. This marks the beginning of the unraveling of the couple's marriage. Trevelyan, being a true Victorian male, fails to understand his wife's rebellion and he acts out in the worst way imaginable - leading to the destruction of their family life.

The main plot is quite dismal, downright tragic even, but there are two sub-plots which make up for this - one centers around a young woman's struggle to find a measure of happiness, in spite of her domineering and disapproving spinster aunt. The other sub-plot centers around a vicar who finds himself the object of affection of two sisters. There are plenty of uplifting, at times comic moments in these two sub-plots to make up for the truly depressing nature of the main story. There's also Emily's sister Nora, who could have her pick of men, yet chooses to marry for love. I can understand why some viewers might find this a disappointing watch as Anthony Trollope's novels do tend to be dismal in theme and subject matter. Despite this, I found this production to be well-made, brilliantly acted, and engaging.",1269043200,2,1923,4.990654205607477
2169074,3,B00065GVIO,"This BBC series, ""He Knew He Was Right"" is based on an Anthony Trollope novel.  As usual the BBC's production is exquisite, the cinematography is magnificent and the performances outstanding.

The story centers on a young couple and their son.  Emily, the wife, persists in maintaining a friendly relationship with her Godfather and her father's best friend, Colonel Osborne, a man who is disreputable and who caused the dissolution of other marriages.  Emily, however, innocently believes that she has every right to continue seeing the Colonel, played by the brilliant Bill Nighy.

As Louie, her husband, discovers her defiance in still seeing and flirting with Osborne, he believes she has committed adultery. The story is never clear why she does this.  Is she really guilty of adultery?  The situation literally drives him insane.

The plot has four other romantic relationships: Louie's best friend and Emily's sister Nora; a rather boring couple who are niece and nephew on opposite sides of a family; a Lord Glasgow and an American Socialite that is intriguing and undeveloped; and the hilarious Reverend Gibson caught between the claws and fangs of two bitterly rivalrous sisters.

This may be a period piece but the angst and obsession would be as relevant in today's modern drama. The story leads to an inevitable tragic conclusion.  To sample Trollope's inimitable humor, read ""Barchester Towers"".",1252713600,,1409,5.222222222222222
2169075,2,B00065GVIO,"I am fully agree with Anthony Trollope that this ""He knew he was right"" was totally a failure. Andrew Davies is sort of a genius, he couldn't do better screenplay works, and the actresses are elegant and charming;the actors debonair and spruce. Only the plots spoiled it all. I have squandered hours on such a tv series and in the end I don't understand a thing. The only thing I know is that this Trevelyan is the blokehead among all the blokeheads on this planet. The plots are based, if not entirely, at least mostly, on absurdity. How can such things be true? And what big stuff can the reader learn from this story? The characteres are vividly depicted, and there is humour interwoven with the plots too. But I cannot learn something remarkable about ways of living, about morality etc. This story, generally speaking, is about three marriages. Emily's, Nora's, and Dorothy's. Middlemarch, Pride and Prejudice are about marriages too. But they can be claimed as great works but this ""right"" cannot be classified as classic. Definitely Andrew chose one of the worse work of this literary giant's to dramatise.
I will give five stars for music, acting, screening. But I will give no star at all for the plots. if you want to appreciate Andrew Davies's genius, this tv series may be a good chance-I think he did a better job in screenplaying than in Bleak House. But if you want to watch it to appreciate Anthony's genius, or to learn something useful, you'd better never touch this one.",1252540800,6,1489,4.708812260536399

2169077,4,B00065GVIO,"I found this film to be immensely entertaining.  For those who have not read Trollope's works - the film is yet another adaptation with multiple sub plots that link ever so slightly, to create a masterpiece well acted by both major and minor characters.

The film is sweepingly produced with detailed costuming and diverse characters: You cannot help but suspect the skulking Colonel Osborne [Bill Nighy], loathe the petulant preacher or the French sisters, and feel pity for Louis & Emily [Oliver Dimsdale & Laura Fraser](our star couple) in their scandalous dilemma, for which the main story revolves.

The film deals so much with trust and devotion in EACH of its storylines - The mistrusting ones making unhappy lives with their wives, daughters and livelihoods.....the devoted ones sacrificing their possible happiness for the ones they love.

Occasionally the characters break the ""fourth wall"" by conversing with the audience - at first I found this an awkward intrusion, but soon came to realize it was part of the story's charm - revealing either humorous or sad confidences.

Overall, it should not matter whether the ending is sad or happy - the meat of the matter is what is applause worthy or not....and it surely was a great story retold for me!",1232323200,2,1259,4.976190476190476

There is nothing redeeming about this film aside from excellent production values. The main character is intent on misjudging his bride throughout the movie and the whole production winds down into a depressing and uninspiring death scene. There is no moral high-ground here, no lessons to be learned to make the hours worth spending, not even the mildly endearing subplot can rescue this dismal storyline.
I love period films, but I wish I hadn't bothered to pay for this one. I agree with the reviewer who suggested you rent it if you MUST watch every period film out there, but if the responses of those who have borrowed this film from me are any proof, they hated it as much as I do.

He was somewhat justified in his suspicions, but then goes mad and turns hateful and distrusting of the world and then intends to teach this to his son but dithers and relents only to kill himself through worry. I think the wives unbending and non-sacrifice with such a lack of understanding and empathy done with such a calm babe in the woods demeanor is horrible on her part as well, he wasn't asking for the world.

No effort to flesh out the husbands background and own growing up to help explain such a bizarre spiral is made, making this a very weak effort indeed. Both the husband and wives acting are very much flat as well, we expected it to build to something more passionate and concrete only to be shown a sort of whimper and then predictable end in unspecified death used interminably in Victorian literature.

The only interesting and entertaining part is the priest and his vacillations with respect to a number of women who seem to think he's so great. It's a funny interlude and contrast to the quite boring main story, oddly the two don't really intersect making for a disjointed production.

It's a BBC production, so expect the usual excellent casting, acting, production values, cinematography and direction. But, alas, beware the story. I have not read Trollope's book, so I don't know whether to blame him or Davies. Trollope, I suspect, as there was absolutely no character development throughout the movie. Everyone we meet at the beginning is exactly the same at the end. Also, the various stories are only tangentially tied together so, at times, I found myself wondering why I was seeing a particular story that seemed to have nothing to do with any other story. Ultimately, I felt the biggest problem was your central character was, literally, insane, which meant he had no control over his mind and, by extension, his decisions. I watch movies to see characters adapt and change and overcome their fears, but he was incapable of doing that. As a result, the movie felt absolutely stagnant. And boring.

2169096,4,B00065GVIO,"First of all, let me say that this was my first introduction to Anthony Trollope.  I have never read any of his books, and I was not sure what his particular writing style would be and if I would like it or not.  I couldn't find that many reviews of this particular movie on the internet, and I almost did not purchase it.  I decided to get the Anthony Trollope Collection anyway and wanted to try the movie that seemed to be the least liked first and go up from there.  As usual, when Andrew Davies is involved, everything was very well done.  The scenery was very pretty, the clothing, sets, etc. really made you feel like you were there.  The characters were all easy to look at and, for the most part, pretty likeable.  The main story focuses on the newly married Trevelyns and his unfounded jealousy.  There are also many other storylines going on, though.  Emily Trevelyn's sister, Nora, and her love interest; the entertaining vicar and the French sisters; Hugh, his sister, Dorothy, and their love interests, all have big parts in the movie, so that the main storyline doesn't bring the whole thing down.  I was pleased to find humor, too.  With so many unique characters, it never gets boring.  In fact, I stayed up until 1 o'clock in the morning because I just had to know how it ended.  I am not saying that it is replacing my Pride and Prejudice, North and South, or Wives and Daughters, but it was well worth the time, and I plan to watch it again.

2169098,4,B00065GVIO,"I have to say that I had mixed feelings about this miniseries when I first started watching it.  First of all, I never read the Anthony Trollope novel this program is based on and I was at a loss of what to expect.  Second, I didn't like the fact that the characters spoke to the viewer.  Those monologues seemed awkward and just silly to me at first.  But then I realized that the monologues were important for the viewer to understand the characters' inner conflicts and feelings.  He Knew He Was Right is yet another wonderful BBC masterpiece that tells a story that is ironic, tragic, poignant, but also funny.  Louis Trevelyan (Oliver Dimsdale) thought he'd married the perfect woman.  But when his wife Emily (Laura Fraser) begins to have daily visits from her godfather, the Colonel Osborne (Bill Nighy), Trevelyan is convinced that the two of them are having an affair.  And the gossip from third parties doesn't help matters.  Louis wants Emily to sever contact with her godfather and to promise to be faithful, but Emily, a spirited young woman with an independent streak, refuses to make such promises.  After all, she isn't guilty of his accusations.  In this compelling story, we also meet some colorful characters -- a flirtatious clergyman, two rivaling sisters, an old and mischievous scoundrel (Colonel Osborne), an overbearing old woman and her favorite niece -- all of their stories are wonderful to watch.

At first, I thought Louis's jealousy was illogical and he seemed paranoid more than anything to me.  And it turns out that, well, I was right.  I cannot discuss this storyline further without giving away the plot and the things that occur in the story, but the irony in how things unfold was not lost on me.  I wish I had read Trollope's novel before watching this so that I could make a fair comparison.  The miniseries in itself though is wonderful.  I was almost in tears at the end and I enjoyed Dimsdale's performance.  He gave his character plenty of depth and showcased Louis's conflicting emotions and changes in a subtle, yet palatable way.  I wish I could say the same thing for Emily Trevelyan though.  Though I have no idea how talented Ms. Fraser may be, I thought that her portrayal of Emily Trevelyan was quite one-dimensional.  We were told that she was an independent woman (for Victorian standards), but, other than her unwillingness to yield to Louis's illogical demands, this is seldom showcased in the series.  The other actors are great.  Even though I think I've seen some of those faces before but cannot remember (except for Nighy, for he played the aging rock star in Love, Actually), I loved their performances.  As for the production itself, the wardrobe, sets, scenery and production quality are top notch.  But I have yet seen a BBC period piece that isn't beautiful and well-detailed.  He Knew He Was Right is a pleasant surprise.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies has once again showcased his talent for adaptations.

beautiful scenery add to the joys of watching classic works come alive on the screen.

  The novel tells the tragic tale of the wealthy Louis Trevelyan who weds the beautiful Emily . She is the daughter of a British

diplomat posted in the Mandarin Islands. The novel has several

plot strands.

1. Louis wrongly thinking he was right accuses Emily of adultery

with the odious old flirt Colonel Osborne. He take their child

little Louis and flees to Italy. As a result of his fatuous mono-

mania a tragedy transpires.

2. The charming tale of the love of Dorothy and Brook Burke in

the city of Wells.  Anna Massey plays the fussy but lovable old

aunt opposing their union.

3. The story of Nora the sister of Emily and her love for an

impecunious newspaper paper man following her rejection of the

wealthy Lord Glasscock (he in turns falls in love with of all

people-an American)

4. The hilarious tale of poor Rev. Gibson caught between two

frightful French sisters who quarrel and battle over the right to

be Mrs. Gibson!!!!!!!
