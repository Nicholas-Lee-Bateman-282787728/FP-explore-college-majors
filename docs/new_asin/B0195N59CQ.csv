8744052,5,B0195N59CQ,"Mr. Church did a fine job describing the life and the times about John Wesley ""Devil John"" Wright. He covered the Civil War and its effects on the community and the people. I am surprised that  Amazon would allow someone to rate this as anonymous without giving a name or any facts. That is absolutely not fair to Mr. Church or to anyone else who develops a historical product. I enjoyed this DVD  because I have studied the life of Devil John and found it to be very accurate. I would recommend it to others. AMAZON, you need to delete that anonymous person who rated it as a fraud; that is absolutely not right. Margaret Sturgill, Pound, VA",1529193600,,642,4.432203389830509
