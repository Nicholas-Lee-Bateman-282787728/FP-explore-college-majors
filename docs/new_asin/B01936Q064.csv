7562166,5,B01936Q064,"This product is just of superb quality for such a price! The discs run smoothly in my U.S. Blu-ray player. The seller did a a great job in delivering it before expected. Overall, extremely satisfied with the purchase.",1480982400,15,217,4.7368421052631575
7562167,4,B01936Q064,"The picture and sound quality are, as expected for Blu Ray, simply superb. This definitely is a better value than buying the episodes on Google play, specially considering all the extras that come with it.

However, only seasons 1-3 have printed episode guides, seasons 4-6 do not, which is a bummer. The packaging is a thin paper artwork over a strong cardboard box insert which holds the six disk cases. At this price, I wouldn't expect collector's edition quality, but missing episode guides is not excusable.",1480982400,8,512,4.953488372093023
7562168,5,B01936Q064,"This relates to Game of Thrones - Season 1 - 6 (Blu Ray) Region Free, as sold by a2z Blu Ray with order fulfillment by Amazon:

Please remember that ""Region Free"" has been improved and refined in the past few years so that if you have a decent Blu Ray player that has been updated with the latest firmware, you should be JUST FINE!  That said, also remember that typically, Blu Ray disks respond a little more slowly than standard DVD disks in a player, and that may be more noticeable with ""Region Free"" disks.  They do play just fine -- but you may need to be a little bit patient and not try to rush things or you could have a system lockup and need to start over.

Next, as it often is with foreign-produced movie disks, some of the information on the box or the inserts may not be accurate!  I'm not sure why this is so, but you'll probably notice it if you try to add minutes attributed to individual disks and then try to match those totals with what is written on the box or the inserts.  Even the NUMBER of disks themselves, included in a season may be incorrectly stated.  The IMPORTANT thing is to verify that each season is complete, if you have any questions -- but -- be careful in searching for verification information or you might SPOIL your viewing experience by finding out more about the plot than you really want to know!

I did have questions, and the folks at a2z Blu Ray were very quick and exceptionally responsive to my questions!  Let your Amazon Seller help you and avoid the risk of spoiling your enjoyment of the story.

Now, about the quality of the ""Region Free"" Blu Ray disks --

Absolutely perfect!  Give your player enough time to ""spool-up"" and buffer the splash-pages you need to reference and you should be just fine!  I have not experienced any in-play lockups, pixilation, or any other problems.  Audio is uniformly very good also.

I am enchanted and engaged by the story line, and that, of course, is a separate matter altogether.  I've tried to focus on the more ""nuts-and-bolts"" aspect of actually playing the disks.  Just take your time with NAVIGATION through the menu startups and you should have no problems.

Another bonus to buying from an excellent Amazon Seller like a2z Blu Ray is that, at the moment, you can buy the entire six-season set for $100 - $110 (it fluctuates).  Or, you can go to a big discount membership warehouse like Costco and pay $149....

Enjoy!  See you on ""the Wall""....

**** 11 Dec 16 -- Additional comment: Have now worked my way up through Season 4, Episode 2 and have not had any problems getting any of the disks to play perfectly on my Sony Blu-ray player (here in the United States). As long as you don't get in a big hurry and try to jam too many commands on top of each other you should be just fine with these region-free disks.

A big plus if you are multi-lingual!  There are voice tracks in many different foreign languages, as well as subtitles.  The German language voice tracks are surprisingly well done!  Enjoy! ****

***** 24 Dec 16 -- Additional comment after completing watching all six seasons, and a number of the special features.

EXCELLENT!  No problems at all on my Sony Blu-ray disk player.  Region-free worked just fine for me here in the U. S.  . The special features are ingeniously arranged, and help the viewer to more easily understand the very complex kingdoms and lands of Game of Thrones.
This is easily the best entertainment value I have seen in years.  Now I'm sick at the prospect of having to wait until months from now before Season 7 is aired by HBO.  I hope you enjoy this series, too.  Thank heaven for Great Britain, without which we English-speakers would have only the United States as a supplier of entertainment... and that is often disappointing.

I don't recall the name of the show/movie it thought was in. The discs themselves worked and played fine so it could be a Sony (grace note) issue and not a disk issue.

There's a map in Season 1 of the entire world of Game of Thrones which is good to use for reference as you get to know characters and places.",1507334400,,653,4.396694214876033

ONLY issue I have is the formatting. On average you will have 5 CDs for one season and you'll come across CDs with only 1 episode loaded onto it.
If you are trying to binge-watch an entire season you are gonna become rather annoyed having to get up and restart the unskippable intro before the title screen. Usually you can bypass this by directly selecting the next episode from the main menu BEFORE you switch CDs, and it should immediately start the next episode

7562220,5,B01936Q064,"I almost stopped watching after the first two seasons, there were too many characters thrown in and it was very hard to keep up with who was allied with whom and who was backstabbing who... thankfully by the end of the fourth season, so many characters had been killed off that it became much easier to keep track of everyone.  So if you feel the series is too confusing, keeping going, it gets MUCH better after season 3!!

As for the discs... they all played perfectly fine... however... be forewarned that if you have a Sony player (not sure if it's the same for others), after swapping two or three discs, the next disc will be extremely slow and will probably freeze.  Then, you have to wait for your player to reset and turn itself off... then turn it back on and the disc will play perfectly fine.  I don't know if there is some sort of 'memory' in the Sony player, but for whatever reason, after swapping two or three discs without turning off/on the player between them, the next disc will stutter and eventually completely freeze.

7562255,5,B01936Q064,"This collection is well worth the money at $20 per season. They are region free and they play fine on my old blu ray player. There is a fairly long load time but it's not terrible considering it will take several hours to watch each episode and bonus features.

Speaking of bonus features, this collection is full of them. There is a series of animated histories narrated by the actors that is especially nice for those who haven't read the books. These vignettes delve into the histories, houses and lands of Westeros and are quite informative. There are commentaries from the producers and actors as well that shed light on the creation of the series. There are also a lot of behind the scenes features too.

All in all I recommend this collection. For the price you are getting an incredible amount of entertainment for your money. As I said, the only downside is a longer loading for the discs but it is by no means an insurmountable inconvenience.",1503619200,2,952,4.627218934911243

The all region works great just give a little more time for it to go through its all region software can adjust to your DVD player, I have a cheap $ 45.00 SANYO player I updated its software, grabbed my popcorn, Coke and started watching my program. Ok now a review of the first season, I have no idea from the first season why the show is so popular. Slow uneventful boring. If it weren't  for the occasional young hotties getting naked I would have jump ship, hope season 2 gets better or Craigslist  here I come. I will update later.",1503446400,,771,4.3776223776223775

7562415,4,B01936Q064,"The show starts off a little slow for my taste but once it gets into the characters and the plots it starts to become quite the web. It is one of those shows that you really don't know what to expect because there is always some kind of surprise or twist in the plot. Lena Heady does quite a remarkable job at making me hate her character. She is a vile, incestuous, lying, and spiteful woman and you love to hate her. The show is like the books in many ways but many know, no show or movie done on a book is ever exactly like the book so don't expect it because you will be disappointed otherwise. I binged watched the entire 6 seasons as soon as I got them and it was well worth the money paid for them. I hope season 7 is even better than season 6. This show has a little bit of everything but it is definitely not for the prude types as it has alot of sexual content in it and it definitely is not for little ones to watch. The package showed up in perfect condition and the discs all work great.

As for the Blu-ray set, I found it very well done. The audio and video were great, clarity of the on screen images were very good, load times were fine (not too long) and the box set was of good quality.

The only problem I had was, and this could have just been me, I found it hard to remember which episode I left off on when I would pick up watching again because of how the episodes were formatted with the user interface in the menu...but again, that may have just been myself.

We've so far seen up to season 5 and everything's been flawless. All the discs work as they should, no weird audio or video glitches (I've played some of the discs on an Xbox One and a PlayStation 3 and they all worked great), so no technical issues have impede us from seeing this amazing show and what a show this is. I'm sure that if you're buying this box set, it's because you already know that the series is worth seeing all the way through and I would definitely recommend this box set if you live in the US and want to get seasons 1-6 in an affordable package that is definitely well worth the asking price and more.

First, The outer display sleeve is damaged on 2 corners, to were it looks like it have been dropped multiple times. The corners are mashed.  Secondly, in the season 1 disk case the bottom hinge that holds the discs in place was in pieces causing the case not shut properly. Thirdly, this item says sold as new, but I am finding finger print smudges on the disc as I felt it was necessary to check since I have these other issues mentioned.

Be forewarned, however..  this is brutally bloody at times and nothing less than soft porn is spots.. not for the kids for sure!..

I'm not that in depth a person for G of T, yet I appreciate there is much more to the story than these sixty episodes cover.
As for the series itself, I imagine the creators looked at what the middle ages would really have been like. Not all the smiling fun and games of previous recreations of history. I know, this is meant to be a bit more fantastic, with dragons and magic. Still, there are infulences from history. So I watch through the blood and inflicted pain, for the many concurrent stories keep one wondering, what will happen next?",1487462400,,715,4.682539682539683

So far, I've tried out the first two discs of season 1, and they both played flawlessly on my cheap Sanyo Blu-Ray player.  The outer and inner cases were in perfect shape.  I haven't had a chance to check out all the different features included on each disc, but I'm really excited about being able to watch the episodes with commentary.  There's also the option to watch with an on-screen guide that you can use to get information about the characters in a scene, etc.  I questioned whether I should just get the DVD set instead of Blu-Ray to save some money, but Blu-Ray is definitely worth the extra money!
