Maybe blame it on the musical year (weak).  I do love the Cars however and  their The Dangerous Type on this DVD is a treasure for me.",1526515200,,283,4.283018867924528

8236364,5,B000ZS7HPI,"Nothing like watching music when there were great tunes and lyrics. No lip synching here or digital voice gizmos to help the artists sing! No explicit sexual over tones or tweaking. Just great music that still lives on today on the Internet, in the movies, and in TV commercials! All types of music were played here from R and B to Country to Pop to Rock unlike today! And to have on video the legendary Wolfman Jack! Now if we can get some classic Don Kirschner and American Bandstand! Even Solid Gold!",1413849600,,503,4.478260869565218

8236367,3,B000ZS7HPI,"This volume is when arena rock was in full-force and disco was dying (thank goodness).

Video quality is fine, but sound is not the greatest; it's muddy.

Different ""stars"" pop up between songs to introduce them.

I'll concentrate mostly on the highlights (to me).

Journey puts on a decent-played ""Wheel"" but I'm personally not much of a fan of theirs or especially Steve Perry.  Greg Rollie is hiding in the shadows and doesn't get a single good face shot.  Was he too embarassed to play with them anymore?  Perhaps a sign of things to come as he left the band for good soon after?

Blondie puts on a decent performance of ""Telephone"" but the sound is just awful for some reason.  They are still at their peak before their downturn a year or two later.

George Thorogood Rocks out on ""Move It On Over"" when it was a popular hit song.  He even goes out into the crowd for some soloing.

Ian Hunter plays some arena rock with ""Just Another Night"".  He might just have Mick Ronson on guitar here.

ARS plays one of my favorite songs of theirs, ""Imaginary Lover"".  Not any deviation from the record, and typical mid-tempo.  The singer Ronnie Hammond looks to be out of breath, perhaps because if his pants were any tighter they might burst (typical 70's).

Little River Band competently plays ""Reminiscing"" as typical pop of the period.  No sparks but if you like that, it's OK.

The Cars put out a reasonable performance with no deviation from the record.

And now here's the big problem with this volume.  Fans of The Byrds will be surprised to see the final lineup performing with Clarence White in 1979.  Oh yea?  They must have resurrected him because he died in 1973 (RIP).  Someone in production needs to be bonked on the head for that one.  It is probably from 1973 and that band could PLAY.  It ends too soon.

Alice Cooper plays with a boa constrictor all through ""Babies"".  It almost seems they ended the song abruptly before the end.

George Carlin (still with hair) puts in a performance of ""Class Clown"".  Then we get Bob Uecker in his prime joking about his life of sports but it suddenly cuts off.  Why?

Not a great video overall, but not bad either.  Only recommended to fans of any of the particular artists that don't mind muddy sound.",1245024000,6,2253,4.538653366583541
