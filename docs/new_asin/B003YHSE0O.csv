8409299,5,B003YHSE0O,"Hurricane Katrina deeply impacted many on the gulf coast including the founding father of Rock and Roll Fats Domino. Feared by many as a victim of the storm he was rescued from his flooded home in the 9th ward. Seeing his neighborhood still struggling to rebuild almost 2 years after the storm, it lit a fire in fats and he decided to give the only way he knew how, through music. Included in this film are interviews with Fats friends and narrated by John Goodman, it tells the story of how Fats fought back after Katrina to make one last stand, his last public performance an exciting 30 min concert at Tipitina's nightclub in New Orleans. If you have a love for Fats or just to see what New Orleans and he experienced I highly recommend this film for you.",1379808000,,758,4.421428571428572
8409300,4,B003YHSE0O,"This is a documentary from PBS & as usual, there is unnecessary chatter, especially when Fats is singing (which is why only 4 stars). There are a few songs that we can enjoy all the way through, but, not enough. I would like to see someday, that this will happen to those mindless people, that make these things & let them see & hear just how much of a pain it is to go through it when we want to see & to listen to the artist. It was a happy/sad DVD as it might be the last time to see Fats preform live. Thanks Fats for the wonderful memories that you have given us & wouldn't it be great if they would re-do this DVD properly, such a giving us the entire show & all of the other songs that he sang without interruptions of any kind.  As for the quality of the DVD itself: great.  +JMJ+",1325548800,3,788,3.981012658227848
8409301,5,B003YHSE0O,FATS DOMINO STILL AS GREAT AS EVER.  DON'T HESITATE TO BUY THIS.  I THINK YOU WILL LOVE IT AS MUCH AS WE DO.,1317254400,,108,3.652173913043478
8409302,5,B003YHSE0O,Saw this on a PBS station and the next day I purchased the DVD. I enjoyed it so much I bought another as a gift. Wonderful tribute to an American music legend.,1314662400,,159,4.0
8409303,4,B003YHSE0O,"and purchased the video for posterity as well as to see if I could see any of us in the crowd shots.

Starting with the negative. Though well scripted when the DVD got here and we played it there were some ""issues"" with its quality. Since our daughter and son-in-law were there with us we decided to get another copy for them. If the next one had problems too, it was in its production; if not, we would return the first for a better copy. Both had ""skip"" problems so the disc's production is not the best.

However, no way would I do without my personal copy of that performance, warts and all. Fats is one of my most favored artists. I know how much he means to The City as well as how important The City is to him. It was an incredible evening and the DVD captures a hint of the electricity in the air that night. It also captures one of the sadder moments when speaking about Fats' almost leaving the stage early. Katrina wrecked devastation on NOLA and coming back has been tough on its fans as well as its residents. The Fat Man gave this gig everything he had and it shows. Interviews with Allen Tousaint, Dr. John, Randy Newman, Irma Thomas and Robert Plant only add to the flavor of this presentation. Don't buy it it because you want a perfect compendium of Fats Domino's greatest hits, buy it because you want to understand just a bit more of the love story between Fats and his City, you'll be glad you did.",1309824000,3,1419,4.291044776119403
8409304,5,B003YHSE0O,"A mix of history and music - and tragedy. But Fats Domino, at age 79, found a way bringing happiness and vibrancy to the recovering citizens of New Orleans, in 2007.

Stunning footage of the results of Katrina balanced against archival footage and stills of the great cultural center.

A real bonanza for Fats Domino fans, as 1950s TV performances meld with a terrific comeback show for Fats at Tipitina's, including inspired performances of ""Blueberry Hill, ""Ain't That a Shame"", ""My Girl Josephine"", and ""Blue Monday"". It turned out to be a comeback show for The Fat man - and a Comeback for his home town. Early black and white clips include two relative rarities, It's You I Love and Valley of Tears. The latter classic is shown on kinescope, on location in 2007, and in two variations by fan and legend in his own right, Robert Plant.

Nice interview spots feature Carla Thomas, Dr. John, Allen Tousssaint, and a few journalists. far too many of these segments are used, however. I'm watching Antoine tearing it up one minute...then a close-up of some dude pontificating again.",1284163200,3,1082,4.806451612903226
