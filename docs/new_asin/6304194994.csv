865659,3,6304194994,"Three seriously grusome and actually quite disturbing stories that come from a book that is being read by H.P. Lovecraft (ACTOR). If your just a horror buff that loves everything, then this might actually be quite an  appetite.",946857600,,227,4.973684210526316
865660,2,6304194994,"Although I enjoyed seeing David Warner and Richard Lynch in this video, I had to ask ""why, why, why, won't *anyone* do a faithful adaptation of a Lovecraft story?"" Great effects, nice music, but terrible to watch  if pure HPL is your thing.",940809600,2,240,4.5813953488372094
865785,1,6304194994,"This is supposedly based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, which is evident in the first story in the movie.  This first movie is probably the best on here, but its nowhere near the true genius of Lovecraft.  The other two movies go from pathetic to blasphemy of the Lovecraft name.  The best thing about H.P. Lovecraft's style of writing is that it is very subtle and bizarre.  Is the third movie on here either subtle or bizarre?  No, and slightly.  Lovecraft didn't used buckets of blood and sawed off limbs in his fiction, and he sure didn't spoil it with BAD ACTING, THIN PLOTS, AND GORE-O-RAMA!!!  For all other Lovecraft fans out there, stay away from this wretched little waste of plastic.",984700800,5,698,4.626016260162602
865786,1,6304194994,"This collection of short episodes is very loosely based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, one of the founders of modern horror. There are three independent stories held together by the ""wraparound"" segment. In the wraparound story, H.P. Lovecraft himself comes to a mystic monastery to research a book containing unspeakable secrets. Jeffery Combs (whom you might recognize as the main character in Re-Animator, or the deranged FBI agent in The Frighteners) looks fairly similar to the real Lovecraft and plays him in an amusing, twitchy manner. This Lovecraft as an Indiana Jones-like occult detective is of course not very close to the real author who, to my knowledge, was a frail, neurotic reclusive. Anyway. As ""Lovecraft"" reads the forbidden book, we are shown the stories within.
In the first story set somewhere between the 30s and 50s (?) a man moves back to the house he grew up in, a large spooky mansion on the Scottish coast, on top of a crumbling cliff riddled with subterranean caves. He moved out because of a personal tragedy where his beloved drowned, and the house has been empty and falling apart since then. When cleaning up he discovers the hidden diary of a captain who once lived there. The captain rejected God and cursed Him after the captain's family drowned. His blasphemy attracted the attention of certain Others, who thoughtfully provide the captain with the means of resurrecting his loved ones - a ""Book of the Dead"". Our main character is apparently not worried by the fact that the diary abruptly ends after the ceremony, but starts looking if he can find this book and do some necromancy of his own. This first story is by far the best. It stays closest to the spirit of the original stories by Lovecraft, and the special effects are not half bad considering the budget of the film. At least the makers knew when to hide things and when to show them, and the setting is good. The acting is decent.
The second story is a lot weaker. It is a gory tale centered more on human evil than on ""Unspeakable Things from the Beyond"". That's acceptable, Lovecraft wrote a couple of stories like that too in the Chuthulu mythos. Unfortunately this feels more like a bad Tales from the Crypt episode. The main problem is the large number of plot holes, the acting (David Warner as the Doctor is OK though), and the fact that the story is so predictable. A number of serial killings in a modern American city have attracted the attentions of a drunken journalist. Unlike the police, he immediately discovers who is responsible. Of course, he does the only logical thing. He goes to the house of the killers, alone and drunk, and demands to know the whole story. Uh...sure.  Could you just take off your clothes and lay down on this kill floor first? Thank you.
The third story is really weak. A male and a female police officer are having a domestic argument in their police car in the middle of a car chase. One of them takes off the seat belt in the heat of the argument (very likely), and a car crash predictably ensues, in the ""bad parts"" of the city. The male officer is dragged away by persons or beings unknown, leaving a track of blood, which the female officer nervously follows once she wakes up. She follows the track into an urban industrial wasteland, which turns into a dark metal labyrinth leading deeper down into the ground. The atmosphere at this point is something like the Resident Evil games, but it soon turns silly and predictable. The special effects are [poor], and the acting is laughable. The ending is especially pathetic. ""Oh, it was all a dream. Whew...Oh no! It wasn't! Eeek! Horror!"" Why would Beings From The Beyond stoop to bad practical jokes? Believe me, this was not a spoiler, you can see it coming miles away.
If all the episodes had been like the first one, this film would have gotten three stars. As it is, one and a half, maximum. Pick up the books instead.",979776000,4,3923,4.652737752161383

This one guy tries to bring back his wife from a watery grave.. But will she be the same, or will she be looking for some bloody-revnege? I like this one for the cool, slimy looking monster in here.. 2nd story - Well, well, this one is pretty weird, this old doctor likes to preserve life, such as flowers and stuff, but he also discovers how to preserve humans with freezing temperatures.. Well, to put this short, this one isn't spooky ooky at all, I think it's more drama-ish.. 3rd story - This one IS the best! This one starts off great and ends the same way.. No slow downs at all in this one! 2 cops are on a red hot pursuit to catching a killer called 'The Butcher' After their car flips over they follow him in a cave, but is this guy really human! Well, anyway, this one is weird weird weird! Just you wait till you see the ending, you'll be like huh? Definitely worth watching, just for this story alone..

865788,1,6304194994,"This movie is useful more as a means of measuring how much (unfortunately) ""hack"" horror films have been influenced by HPL than as a tribute to the genius of Lovecraft and his horror stories.
Obviously the plots  are Lovecraftian as they were plundered from good tales (to which they do  no justice) and they give one the sensation of reading new Cthulhu mythos  stories, but they miss the point entirely.
Lovecraft exploits mankind's  innermost fears and his great vulnerability to that which comes from the  unknown, as well as the consequences of exploring beyond our reaches. The  movie posseses none of that spirit, only vaguely alluding to the batrachian  monstrosities that populate HPLs world. If you are a fan, you may have fun  with what they have done to Lovecraft's stories, or you may hate it for the  same reason. If not, it's strictly a B ""horror"" movie.",963532800,4,869,4.8175675675675675
865789,5,6304194994,"In order to really like this video, you have to be into the kind of literature Lovecraft writes about.  If you are not into the whole Mysticism scene, this movie is not for you, but I personally loved the movie.",962064000,,211,4.275
865790,1,6304194994,"I'm not really all that familiar with H.P. Lovecraft or his writings, and perhaps that ignorance has colored my reaction to this movie.  But after watching this abomination, it's highly unlikely that I'll be picking up one  of Lovecraft's books in the near future.  It's confusing almost from the  very beginning (stories within dreams within stories).  The gore is neither  frightening nor funny.  The framing story about Lovecraft makes no sense,  and the individual narratives aren't much better.  Worst of all is the  third tale, which follows a pregnant police officer as she becomes the  captive of a group of alien monsters that (I have to say this without  revealing too much, since I suppose there might be some people who actually  want to be surprised by this film) do some pretty terrible things to her.  I mean, I could sort of accept the rest of the movie as a really bad  Creepshow/Tales from the Dark Side kind of horror anthology, but this third  segment just really assaults the boundaries of basic human decency.  Please  don't misunderstand and think I'm some sort of weak-stomached cinematic  chicken (I laughed all the way through Dead Alive); there's just something  about the third little story that really, really crosses the line.  It was  enough to ruin a whole day of my life.  Even more so than the overly  commercialized movies that too often end up in multiplexes, films like  ""Necronomicon: Book of the Dead"" should never even be made.",960940800,2,1467,4.865853658536586
865791,3,6304194994,"I happen to have the Necronomicon book, and if you didn't know what it was, this movie would be very confusing.  So it's not a good Lovecraft adaptation, that doesn't mean you can't still enjoy it.  I personally  enjoyed this more than From Beyond, and so did my friends.  This also  really didn't have that much to do with the Necronomicon.  They talked  about it in the first story, and then it dissapeared.  They didn't need  Lovecraft reading the book either, because he claimed it didn't exist.  If  you haven't read Lovecraft, this is for you, but if you have, bypass this.",960163200,5,579,4.578431372549019
865792,1,6304194994,"This has gotta be THE most pitiable ""Lovecraft"" movie I've ever seen. The segments have little to nothing to do with the stories upon which they were based and degenerate into a laughable gorefest guaranteed to make  poor Howard roll over at least a few more times in his eldritch sepulchre.  The segment based on Cool Air is probably the best of the bunch. It stays  somewhat true to the story and strangely enough has a not-so-cheesy love  story woven into it. Unfortunately, it too fell apart when the director  decided to throw a few chunks of gore in it to ""spice up"" the  plot. Flat out, this is just a tacky tribute (if you can call it that) to  Lovecraft that makes even the Unnamable II look like a brilliant moment in  cinematic history. If you want the feel of a Lovecraft story in a movie  then you're better off buying Carpenter's The Thing or The Resurrected,  which was a pretty neat adaption of Charles Dexter Ward with Jane Sibbet  from Herman's Head (hubba! hubba!)",959817600,3,983,4.528409090909091

7870350,5,6304194994,"How is there not a version of this wonderfully gooey Lovecraft inspired movie on DVD I cannot understand! One of my all time favorite lower budget H.P.L based films! This movie contains one of the best puppet-Cthulhu monsters ever put on a screen in my opinion. I was much younger when I first saw this movie, and when the creature broke through the floorboards for the first time and rolled its' ugly eye....how scary! Very underrated!",1460073600,,436,4.75
7870351,4,6304194994,"I've seen this movie a couple times, separated by maybe three or four years. It's been a long time since the last viewing. And there is a very good reason for that! I'm a Lovecraft fan and as such am used to disturbing ideas, images, and atmospheres. But this movie beats every other ""horror"" flick I've ever seen in its pure nightmare-inducing depravity. Good stuff! If you're into that sort of thing. I used to be very much so.

I don't think the dates are correct as I rented it twice back in the mid and late '90's and never bought the VHS tape. I was still living in SD, so it was before 1998 for sure. I might be waiting for it to be released on DVD but since it hasn't happened yet (as far as I know) I'm kind of hoping it will be a Blu-ray instead. Although... honestly, I'm not sure I'd want it in my house, attracting the things it might attract, opening doors that are better left closed. Seriously, this is something H.P. Lovecraft would himself have said. Both times I have watched this movie I've been plagued with nightmares (almost night-terror levels of ""horrification"") for several nights afterward. Lovecraft would've approved and undoubtedly enjoyed the experience. Normal nightmares are fun but this movie produces hellish dreams.

No, it does not contain any adaptations of any specific Lovecraft stories. But it does one thing that no other ""Lovecraft"" movie I've ever seen has done, something that HPL himself strove for in his stories: this movie captures the essence of mood and setting that fuels Lovecraft's stories.

The ""frame story"" is just that. It does its job very well: it sets the mood for the rest of the stories it contains. It's a little ""out there"" but... it's a horror movie, what do you really expect? The rest of the stories get more and more spooky/freaky/terrifying/gross the deeper in you get. The last one... I am shaking my head here as I write this... it is gory and I'm not a fan of gore. I find it to be merely disgusting, not horrifying in any way. The urge to vomit is not the same as what I call the ""full body tingle"" reaction to being truly horrified. But the last story is the only example in all the horror movies I've seen of gore being part of and contributing to the actual horror of the situation being perpetrated upon the character(s).

Overall, this is a great and perhaps the only example of a good ""Lovecraftian"" movie. IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is very good, too, but I really have to put this NECRONOMICON ahead of it. THE THING is good, too, but not nearly as good as this one.

There's just something about Lovecraft's brand of ""cosmic horror"" that resonates with my very being; this movie rocked me to my core and for that reason I don't possess a copy of it. I strongly recommend renting it or maybe borrowing it from someone you think you know because I'm serious about it opening doors. It will affect you if you are open to it, and maybe even if you aren't. If you have to buy it to see it, be prepared to burn (I mean destroy, here!) the copy after you watch it. I'm very undecided about whether I'd want to have it sitting on my shelf, looking at me all the time. But I also want to see it again sometime...

...how very ""Lovecraftian,"" indeed!",1423612800,3,3220,4.4491525423728815
7870352,1,6304194994,"H.P. Lovecraft must be spinning in his grave from this film. ""H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon: Book of the Dead"" is a horror anthology film with three stories of macabre and a wraparound story. ""The Library"" is the name of the wraparound story and features Jeffrey Combs playing Howard Philip Lovecraft himself as he enters an esoteric library guarded by monks as he sneaks off to read from the mystical book, ""Necronomicon.""

As the movie continues, the next story is called ""The Drowned"" and this is actually a fairly well told story. Flashbacks tell of a man's ancestor who loses his family in a tragic accident but manages to resurrect them after he reads from the ""Necronomicon."" The third story is slightly above mediocre. It is an adaption of the story ""Cool Air"" called ""The Cold,"" which features a journalist investigating cold cases of missing persons which may lead back to a single house. The woman he confronts tells of her past and a possibly mad doctor she once lived with. This segment of the film is watchable but the corniness of the special effects take you out of the story.

The final story ""Whispers"" is about a cop who sees her partner dragged off by a mysterious serial killer named ""The Butcher,"" into an urban complex where a strange cult-like sub-society exists. Without diving into too much detail, this tale sucks! It is mind-numbingly stupid, cheaply made, poorly acted and ill-conceived. It wasn't much better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manos-the-Hands-of-Fate/dp/B0000AGWMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manos, the Hands of Fate</a>. Following ""Whispers"" is the conclusion of ""The Library"" story. That ends very poorly as well with insultingly dumb plot turns and silly special effects. Worst of all, this entire movie is so dumb and cheesy but not in a fun way. I know Lovecraft's brand of horror may be difficult to translate onto the silver screen but this movie is bush league horror. I normally have a soft spot for portmanteau films, especially horror anthology films, but this movie is a big dud. ""H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon: Book of the Dead"" should be avoided and I do not recommend it at all!",1341964800,,2185,5.186968838526912

Don't expect a legitimate Lovecraft tie-in: Lovecraft appears as a character in a ""wraparound"" uniting three unrelated stories, but it's not Lovecraft the historical character--there's a disclaimer at the end of the film admitting as much--nor do the stories themselves reflect Lovecraft's ethos.  Lovecraft was about understatement and suggestion; this film takes the opposite track with dripping gore and monsters in full view.  To me, that's no bad thing, but as you can tell from the reviews here, plenty of hard-core Lovecraft fans disagree.  What the movie does offer is plenty of slime covered latex masks and monsters, and you get good views of them; one pretty good story, one mediocre story, and one gross-out fairly stupid story; lots of mediocre to bad acting, and a quick, totally gratuitous and titillating (so to speak) shot of one of the actresses naked in the shower.

7870356,5,6304194994,"What a film. While not a great film in Acamedy Award level production values, this is a really good movie. Seldom has this reviewer seen the power and atmosphere of Lovecraft's work placed on film. HPL purists have good reason to complain that the 3 stories in this anthology style treatment have very little to do with any specific Lovecraft work, but the overall chemistry of the film has captured the distilled essence of HPL even better than Re-Animator did. It is as if HPL himself was left to do the cinematography, set decoration, casting, foley, ADR and scoring to this film. Those not familiar with Lovecraft might be quite confused, but more open-minded fans of his work will recognize elements from a dozen or more HPL stories permiating the film. The venerable Jeff Coombs plays HPL himself who locates the evil book in a library. Other great faces include David Warner in an unforgettable role as well as Richard Lynch and Bruce Payne. SFX are above passible and the whole film is a gory joyride. Necronomicon is an overlooked gem of a horror film that deserves a view.

However, on the Lovecraftian aspects, the movie title is misleading.  The plot may be constructed around the book itself, but the movie gives absolutely no audience to the story Lovecraft put behind it.  I give it three out of five - the movie impliments Lovecraftian ideas, but does not deliver the actual story Lovecraft wrote about the Necronomicon.",1071705600,2,586,5.020618556701031
7870358,4,6304194994,"For some reason, people give this movie such low marks without giving actually viewing the movie as a movie. Perhaps its because the name HP Lovecraft was attached to yet another adaptation failure, and they thought, quite foolishly, that this meant that there would be a Lovecraftian film that was actually Lovecraftian. Well, that never happens and the H.P. is almost always attached to sell more movies and to get more bad reviews. Still, while not a standout jewel in the forum of monster movies (and what really is in the true monstrosity arena?), it does hits 4.5 star highs and 2.2 star lows to make it worth seeing. You just have to forget that nefarious little label.
This movie is set in 1932 with everyone's favorite actor, the immortal Jeffrey Combs, as a strangle Indiana Joneseque version of H.P. Lovecraft. In it, Lovecraft decides to steal a view (and the book itself later) of the infamous Necronomicon despite the wishes (and warnings of its keepers). Taking a key from one of its monk keepers, he finds his way to a secretive chamber where he finds the book and begins to transcribe three stories - The Drowned, The Cold, and The Whispers - from what he sees here.
The Drowned, a story borrowing from Lovecraftian themes and mingling in some ideas from differing stories, is about a man returning to an inherited hotel and finding more than he bargained for. Our main character looks over a letter from his Uncle that, in flashback sequencing, finds his family dead and denouncing God for it. After throwing his bible to the ground, he is visited by a good looking Deep One who replaces the book with another. Reading from it, he finds his family returned, but only in a small sense of the word. Well, our main character, seeing only the ""raising the dead"" and not the lesson in the tale, decides to liberate the book from its hiding place and resurrect his long lost wife, leading us to a showdown with a huge one-eyed monster (I can't call the thing great cthulhu).
The Cold, a good piece adapted from Cool Air, begins with a reporter who is investigating a series of murders going to a house and speaking to the current owner. After loosing her tongue her with a series of threats, she reveals a story involving her mother and a doctor with a ""Skin condition"" that first owned this place. This story's ending is actual good, plus the body of the tale is also an interesting piece. I would have to say it also pulls its weight with a 3.5 to a 4.0 rating.
Wanting to forget The Whispers, I'll only break it down briefly. Here is a tale about a female officer chasing a criminal who turns out not to be a criminal unto a cavern (more like an abandoned sewer) of terror (and yawning). It has a little gore, some scary homeless people - one of which is blind -, a lot of crawling and chasing, and some really, really bad acting. I would give it a 2.2 only because I had to spit on the other two pieces here.
  If you haven't seen this movie before, its not really a bad addition to anyone's growing horror selection. Just don't build a house of expectations on it.",1024963200,18,3081,4.509838998211091
