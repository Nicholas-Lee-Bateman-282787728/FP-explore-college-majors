8722232,5,B010EJOB3I,I am a horror movie fan that being said finding packs of horror movies that I don't own half already is not as easy as it once was.  These are not the highest budget movies but most are original and none so bad that I couldn't watch them.  I think there are a few duds and a few gems but anyone buying a binge pack like this would probably expect that and for the price its not the hugest risk anyone could take.,1469232000,2,412,3.9518072289156625
