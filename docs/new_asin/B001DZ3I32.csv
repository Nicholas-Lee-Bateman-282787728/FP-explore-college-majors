8295516,5,B001DZ3I32,"Backyard Basics says it all! The DVD is perfect for a football loving 5 y.o. My son loves and continues to request this DVD from time to time. It truly does offer tips from the pros!! As a mom uninterested in football...I found it to offer great info to coach my own backyard game! DVD is quick, to the point and holds interest from beginning to end for many age groups.",1401753600,,370,4.225352112676056
8295517,1,B001DZ3I32,"My Mistake:
I'm sure it is very nice for children but when I saw the extremely basic platform of it, I sent it back.  Somehow I had thought that the ""PROs would be giving more information than I heard.  Football has always been big in my life.....even as I married a champion football player, but I don't always understand some aspects of the game.

 I guess the title starting with the word ""Backyard"" should have been a red flag for me.",1390867200,,438,4.37037037037037
