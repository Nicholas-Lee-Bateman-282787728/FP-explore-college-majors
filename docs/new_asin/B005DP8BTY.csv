I am so saddened by the way that the former players are treated by the NFL.  Everyone thinks that the old timers who paved the way for the current players were treated well, THINK AGAIN!! Denied disability coverage after playing and even becoming an Hall of Famer.  To be treated like nothing once they leave sucks.  I know it is the way sports is, but its still disheartening.  GREAT DOCUMENTARY!!!!!!!!!",1425254400,,514,4.543478260869565
