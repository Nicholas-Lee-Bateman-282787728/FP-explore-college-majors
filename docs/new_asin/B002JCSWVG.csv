3937638,1,B002JCSWVG,"There was an old saying in ""The Right Stuff:"" ""Sometimes YOU CAN'T screw the pooch,"" meaning there are some circumstances or people in or to which it is impossible to lose ""the halo.""

Nelson Mandella is one of these people, that even though he and his wife murdered political opponents, and did nothing but help turn South Africa into a pathetic reflection of what it once was (outside of Apartheid).

I think Clint simply never bothered to search out the truth and bought into this ""George Washington of Africa"" business. Let's look at WHAT HE ACTUALLY accomplished:

Apart from having a likeable personality, he achieved next to nothing in his relatively short political career which saw South Africa rapidly decline to the status of the world's most violent and crime-ridden country, and, to add to the confusion, his greatest friends are communists and dictators like Fidel Castro, Moammar Qaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein. His ex-wife Winnie Mandela, whom he quickly jettisoned when it became clear she was a considerable embarassment to his political career, is a self-confessed advocate of terrorism and violence and has even committed murder. It was only after irrefutable eye-witnesses offered proof that his wife ""Winnie"" had found a 14 year-old son of a political (black) enemy, had him cuffed and a tire placed around him, filled the tire with gasoline and set him ablaze that it was deemed 'time to divorce Winnie...'

In his public statements and speeches Mandela is always critical of the democratic countries of the west, but has nothing but praise for the remaining communist dictatorships of the world. He condemns mistakes and controversial policies of the west, but refuses to publicly condemn the genocides and brutal repression of current or former communist countries; he is supposedly a ""champion of freedom and democracy"", the ""hero of oppressed people everywhere"" but considers dictatorships like Cuba and Libya shining beacons of freedom and justice...

While in America Mandela also made public statements that amounted to support for violence and terrorism in the furtherance of political aims. In a speech in Harlem, referring to four Puerto Rican terrorists who shot and wounded five US Congressmen in 1954, he said:

We support the cause of anyone who is fighting for self-determination, and our attitude is the same, no matter who it is. I would be honored to sit on the platform with the four comrades you refer to.
Suitable ""comrades"" for Mandela indeed.

Apartheid was and is wrong, but the fact is the post-Apartheid governments have been nothing but corrupt embarrassments, destroying the country. There is no reason to confer the halo of perfection on this man simply because he was victimized unjustly and thrown in prison.

I think Clint should have opened his eyes a little more before jumping on a very ugly bandwagon.",1260489600,25,2871,5.106609808102346
3937639,4,B002JCSWVG,"I suppose a film about Nelson Mandela and his attempts to reunify South Africa is expected to include a number of unsubtle and unoriginal racial themes, namely the literal and symbolic divisions between blacks and whites. ""Invictus"" is such a film. Consider a brief but effective shot in which we see Mandela standing in front of his bathroom mirror, getting ready to shave; the entire bottom half of his face is coated in white shaving cream while the top half is uncovered. Also consider the opening scene, which takes place on February 11, 1990, the date Mandela was released from prison; two soccer fields are separated by a road, and one of them is bright green and populated by affluent white kids while the other is patchy, brown, and populated by poor black kids. There are also many shots of white rooms with dark furniture, which may or may not symbolize Mandela's hope for a peaceful coexistence.

While nowhere near as compelling as his 2008 masterpieces ""Changeling"" and ""Gran Torino,"" ""Invictus"" is still a fine example of Eastwood's affinity for strong stories with equally strong characters, who in this case are drawn from actual historical figures. He relies once again on Morgan Freeman, and while that may seem like a clich casting choice, there's no denying that he was the perfect person to portray Mandela; he not only looks the part, he flawlessly captures his distinct voice and style of delivery. Have you ever heard him speak? He can almost always get a point across, not through actions but simply through deliberate speaking, as if to suggest that serious thought must go into every word before opening your mouth. Listen to one of his speeches on YouTube and you'll know what I'm talking about.

The film focuses on one of Mandela's more unorthodox strategies for rebuilding a peaceful and democratic South Africa: Getting the people to support their national Rugby team, the Springboks, before playing in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Up until then, the Springboks were unanimously hated, mostly because they continued to wear jerseys of green and gold, the colors of apartheid. Many people wanted not only to change the jersey colors, but also to change the name of the team. Mandela, in a move initially resisted, urged his people to leave the name and the colors unchanged, believing that an overhaul of this sort would separate the black and white populations even further. This isn't about petty revenge, he assures, but about moving forward. ""This Rugby,"" his personal assistant asks, ""as a political calculation?"" Mandela asserts, ""It is a human calculation.""

As part of this act of social reform, Mandela personally appeals to the captain of the Springboks, Francois Piennar (Matt Damon), who initially seems cool on the whole race issue until he's shown the prison cell Mandela was locked in; cramped and lacking both a decent view and a basic bed, he stands there envisioning Mandela's harsh living conditions and has his quiet yet powerful transformative moment: ""I was thinking how a man could spend thirty years in prison and come out and forgive the men who did it to him."" Indeed, Mandela practices forgiveness at its highest level, almost to the point where you're not sure he's in touch with reality. Most of us, I suspect, will probably never understand or even want to understand what he went through.

All of this is well done. Still, one can't help but be somewhat critical of the film's formulaic structure, where overt political and social commentaries are abundant and in service of the final match between the Springboks and the New Zealand All Blacks, a team so fierce no other Rugby-playing country has ever been able to defeat them. If you know your history, you already know who wins the game. Even if you don't know your history, the outcome isn't too far removed from those seen in your average inspirational sports movies. Was there no way for Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham to go for something subtler? It's hard to say, but I'd wager that much of this material has been dramatized for the sake of appealing to the movie masses.

Still, you have to give everyone involved credit for crafting an entertaining drama. And I admit that obvious representations of racial prejudice are more effective than metaphors, like those seen in the well intentioned but unsuccessful science fiction fable ""District 9."" What we get from ""Invictus"" is no more or less than a feel-good story, which I know is something we all want to see from time to time. It helps that the characters are strong and the performances are good; one of Eastwood's strengths as a director is his ability to emotionally develop the key figures of a story, which could not be done without capable actors like Freeman and Damon. So no, this movie doesn't reach the same level of excellence as ""Changeling"" or ""Gran Torino."" But at least it gets the job done, and for that, I'm grateful.",1260489600,2,4912,4.8708133971291865
3937640,2,B002JCSWVG,"This is Clint Eastwood's cinematic ""morality play"" on race, about a white South African rugby team enroute to the World Cup championship during 1995. Mandela had just recently taken over the Presidency of the country and was trying to set the country on a new higher moral footing, but seemed to have as his highest priority, keeping up with the white rugby team's success. As usual Mandela comes off as the super-moral being that in real life he actually is. Only this time his morality is enlarged upon so that white South Africans can ""piggyback"" on it in fiction, in ways that they could never actually achieve in reality. In the process, white South African humanity is enlarged by the same extent to which black subjectivity and black humanity is diminished. Whites are thus transformed from the moral low ground (being the foaming-at-the-mouth racist architects of Apartheid) to the moral high ground (via Mandela acting as their surrogate honorary white). All the more to advanced the barely transparent subtext, which is to pretend that Apartheid is so far into the past as to have never occurred. Every time images of Apartheid attempts to rear its ugly head, Mandela (the designated white surrogate morality police) slaps it back down again with the ""Rodney King mantra: ""Can't we all just get along"" and with the moral force of William Ernest Henley's poem Invictus.

It is an easy and much overused trope to re-humanize white racists through carefully orchestrated morality plays, allowing them to regain the moral high ground by fiat. What is left unsaid in the subtext of this movie is that as of yet, there aren't any visible reasons to enlarge white South African humanity based on its deeds since the Mandela revolution. With only cosmetic adjustments, the racist social order remains pretty much intact as it did during Apartheid. So the conversion had to be done via a fictionalized drama, a drama cast in the mold of the universal white humanity with Mandela as their ""stand-in,"" and Clint Eastwood as their ""moral pimp.""

And sadly, even with Mandela (Morgan Freeman) in the lead role, there is no visible black humanity, or black subjectivity. Unless that is, you can call a single cameo ""militant pout"" by Mandela's daughter, black humanity; or the genuflecting black maids, shantytown street urchins, or blacks sports fans wildly cheering a rugby match, as black humanity. (I didn't even know that Black South Africans liked rugby, do they?)

In these ""soft racist morality plays,"" it seems that black humanity and white humanity are mutual exclusive conditions: They simply cannot coexist together (otherwise white humanity might be contaminate (or is it annihilated)?). Movies with racial themes are either of an all-black cast, or an all white cast, or, in the post-modern world, a mixed cast but told only through white morality, humanity and subjectivity. That is to say, it is told only as a white race-based drama with blacks used only as de-sexed props. This movie of course is of the latter sort. Here, only white South Africans have families; sit down to eat dinner, live in middle class homes; go to work each day; kiss their kids and their wives; express love and affection towards each other, etc. In order for blacks to do this, they of course must have their own segregated drama -whether depiction of the drama occurs in Cape Town, Rio or LA.

Therefore one can see this movie as either being inspiring or irritating depending on what side of the international racial dividing line one resides. If you are white, there is nothing not to like about this movie: The racist social order remains unperturbed and what's more, white humanity is magnified beyond what it is capable of in reality. The hooded killers of the Apartheid regime regain the moral high ground (and become Mandela's bodyguards no less) simply by learning the black version of the South African National Anthem.

On the other hand, if you are black, the movie is subtly demeaning and dehumanizing, but not any more so than most ""soft racist"" Hollywood productions are: Blacks here, are either all sycophants, maids, ghetto creatures, or in Mandela's cabinet. But none, including Mandela himself, have a normal private subjective life. Even the ANC, which ostensible now rules South Africa, was mentioned only in passing. Apparently, a white-based drama (even with a black in the lead) cannot stomach having a genuine black humanity show up on the screen. Black extremes are permitted, but none in the middle, and none considered just normal.

On a personal note, I have been to South Africa four times since the end of Apartheid, once to Johannesburg, twice to Pretoria, and once to Cape Town. To an outsider, things look different only on the surface. The underlying tension is palpable enough to cut it with a knife. At 5pm, all the whites jump into their gun-racked SUVs and pickups and head for the hills (the lily white suburbs). Like in Detroit, Newark, or Chicago, the inner city streets are left to the large number of unemployed young Black males growling with nothing to do and nothing to lose. I was told that at night they rent AK-47s by the hour just to commit crimes. Two stars",1260489600,5,5199,4.9157175398633255
3937641,5,B002JCSWVG,"It takes a true leader to understand and empathize with a former enemy.  When Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) took power in South Africa, he didn't change the name of the national rugby team.  Instead, he embraced them and encouraged their captain, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), to win the 1996 World Cup.

A truly daring move, which his own people initially opposed. But, Mandela understood the pride of the nation and managed with this gracious gesture to bring the people together.

Director Clint Eastwood did his usual amazing job with ""Invictus."" A fellow audience member who recently returned from a visit to South Africa was amazed at how accurately Mandela's cell was depicted.  In addition, both Freeman and Damon did some of their finest work as former enemies brought together to unite a nation.  This is an inspiring performance and one that I predict will garner more than one Academy Award nomination.

3937642,5,B002JCSWVG,"This is the dream film of 2009.  I saw it at Warner Bros Studios the night before Obama received his Nobel Peace Prize and both the film and the Obama phenomenon (fantasy or otherwise) seem to represent our most hopeful selves.

Afterwards, alone in the dark on a cold night,  I wandered around the backlot-- the old New York brownstones from the Jimmy Cagney gangster films, the Paris street from ""Casablanca,"" River City from ""The Music Man,"" James Dean's small town street from ""East of Eden,"" and the stages with plaques on them indicating that ""Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" had been shot inside.  Somehow, this setting which gathered together the whole world of the cinema, was the ideal one in which to process the beautiful movie I had just seen.

The idealism of the old Warner Bros is everywhere present in ""Invictus,"" a ""movie movie"" (which I judge as a Hollywood entertainment-- not as an ""art film"") that takes the world today-- with all its fears and dangers-- and finds within it not decay and destruction, but a global village blessed with hope, the seeds of a better world ahead.

The performances, incidentally, are fine all around.  Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are superb; that, by now we can expect.  But there are wonderful surprises-- especially in the interaction among Mandela's bodyguard, composed of former enemies, white and black.  Eastwood finds many sublime moments here which exemplify the humanity of his late style, of which this film is a prime example.

In Hollywood history, there was once John Ford, Howard Hawks,  John Huston, and Victor Fleming.  Today, let us be grateful that we have Clint Eastwood.  Hooray for his honest, humble poetry!  May he make films until he's 100!",1260403200,5,1763,4.912162162162162
3937643,5,B002JCSWVG,"I saw this movie at a screening last night in Hollywood and I heartily recommend it.  Clint Eastwood is an astute director who let's his characters breathe on screen.  As he's gotten older he's worked with better actors especially in his role as a director and the audience reaps the benefit.  Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are excellent.  As with other Eastwood movies the characters are bloodied mentally, physically and spiritually but they get up, and they move on which is an accurate reflection of what each of us must do to some degree or other in this life.

A picture such as this is a difficult one, do you attempt a whole biography, or do you focus on a period and on the paths of a few of the characters.  Wisely Eastwood chooses to focus on the latter which he skillfully uses to illuminate Mandela's vision, leadership, faith in humanity and pragmatism whilst also showing the transitions that individuals and the country had to make as much needed changes were implemented.  This is a brave film that invites you into the story as a participant rather than have you separated from the story as an observer.",1260230400,4,1121,4.659898477157361

And even though Matt Damon is only 5'11"" to Francois Pienaar's 6'4"", his portrayal of the Springbok captain plus his excellent Afrikaans accent compensate, and in the special feature, ""Matt Damon plays Rugby"" Matt did his own rugby and earned Francois' admiration and friendship.

3937745,4,B002JCSWVG,"The sporting sequences in Clint Eastwood's film are so-so; despite the guttural grunts on the soundtrack, it's clear the actors will never be successful rugby players. The commentary on the game(s) is replete with expressions that would not be used in rugby-playing countries; this is inevitable, perhaps, when the film is aimed at mass audiences, the majority of whom are not au fait with the game's rules.

Yet such shortcomings should not detract from a highly uplifting film that shows how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) not only managed to unify the country during that magical year of 1995, but preached a message of hope and forgiveness that everyone could understand. Director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham are very good at depicting South Africa in the immediate aftermath of Mandela's release, when the whites and blacks had to try to get used to living as equals. This is well illustrated in the subplot involving the security guards, led by Jason (Tony Kgoroge), with white subordinates who up until a few years previously had been arresting their black counterparts. With their sharp suits and stony expressions, the white guards, led by Hendrick (Matt Stern) look especially fearsome.

Mandela's way of reconciling the two races was simple; not just to supplant one regime with another, but to try and reconcile everyone. Hence his insistence on preserving the Springbok name and colors for the rugby team. The sequence where he enters a meeting and overturns a majority black vote to ban the name is especially affecting; Mandela speaks slowly and in measured tones, without trying to antagonize anyone.

The central relationship between Mandela and South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) has been cleverly handled. While Pienaar wants to adapt to the new South Africa, it's clear he is not sure how to do so, until Mandela invites him to afternoon tea. In this oh-so-tranquil of surroundings Mandela outlines his vision and the means to accomplish it, not by imposing his will on anyone but encouraging consensus. It is a lesson well learned; in the World Cup Final when South Africa are trailing the All Blacks, Pienaar calls his team together into a huddle and reminds them of why they are playing the game, not just for themselves but the entire nation.

The title INVICTUS comes from a poem by the nineteenth century British writer W. H. Henley, emphasizing the importance of listening to the gods but remaining ""the captain of one's soul."" This is a lesson both Mandela and Pienaar are well aware of, as together they lead their country into a new era of national unity.",1467849600,,2629,5.022935779816514

3937747,1,B002JCSWVG,"in a country that 'worships' rugby union like a 'real religion' it's almost funny to see the way the united states of america decided to pillage it so thoroughly. it is comparable to england doing a film of the superbowl with english actors and crew.

one really does wonder what the intentions of the filmmakers were...

is it about 'nelson mandela' or 'the springboks' or 'apartheid'

3937794,5,B002JCSWVG,"This serious film depicting the legacy of Apartheid engages the audience from the opening scene. White South African elite rugby team juxtaposed young black people playing a ramshackle version of rugby in a slum. Although, Nelson Mandala is now free and South Africas president this is still a deeply divided society. It seems that despite the Presidents best hopes and efforts to bring about harmony and reconciliation are doomed; ultimately Mandela is regarded with suspicion. An early example of this is when he employs white body guards and private assistants alongside his faithful black employees.

When the elite national rugby team faces humiliating defeat against the English the teams future is in jeopardy. Mandela sees building the rugby team, The Spring Boks, up as a chance to unite the nation and bring about national pride. Despite considerable scepticism, he throws his weight behind building up the teams morale, motivating them to strive to be their best and ultimately changing their ideology. He begins to have an impact on the team when he invites captain, Francois Pienaar to share his ideals. This is the first step to building up their success as a team which later has a significant influence on them winning the world cup at home. Mandalas bold and unprecedented step to indulge his passion for rugby and throw his support behind, The Spring Boks, pays off. And remarkably this results in overcoming racial prejudice and fostering national pride in a disunited country suffering an identity crisis.

Another great movie directed by Clint Eastwood.",1454716800,,1574,5.1686274509803924

Matt Damon is solid as Francois, the rugby team captain who comes to understand Mandela for the man he became in prison for 9,000 days.

3937851,4,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus is an enjoyable film, Morgan Freeman is great as Mandela and it's an inspiring story. The movie revolves around the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Mandela's attempt to unite South Africa behind its rugby team. The tournament was held in South Africa and Mandela was keen to win. He develops a relationship with team captain Francois Pienaar, and plays the role of mentor and motivational coach.

Although it's well-made and worth watching. As a rugby fan I was a little disappointed with the action on the field although most ordinary film-goers may not notice. I was not convinced the director (Clint Eastwood) really understood the game and the actors hired to play the Springboks didn't really look the part. At 5'10"" Matt Damon is a little small to play the 6'3"" and 240 lb Pienaar. Pienaar was a popular charmer with a ready smile and a real ambassador for South African rugby. Damon still seemed to be playing Jason Bourne. It was an intense performance but it wasn't how I remembered Pienaar.

South Africa had been banned from international competition and had not been allowed to play in previous World Cups. The years of isolation had left the Springboks (South Africa) uncompetitive. They were seeded ninth coming into the tournament, but they were playing at home. The action focuses on the final with New Zealand. New Zealand had a phenomenal wing (running back) in the 20 year old Jonah Lomu. Lomu had destroyed England in the semi-final. He was 6'5"" and 265 pounds and had been unstoppable. The Springboks found a way of stopping him in the final. South Africa were the underdogs, but managed to win 15-12 in extra time.

The New Zealand team suffered severe food poisoning two days before the final, and they have always alleged foul play. The film does not deal with any of this. The victory helped unite South Africa and it was probably the right result. This is a feel good film and you are meant to cheer for the Springboks. Overall it's nice for rugby to finally receive some recognition from Hollywood.

Invictus is a short poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The title is Latin for unconquered. It was first published in 1875.",1437523200,,2164,4.762666666666667

Both these brought what Nelson Mandela did and suffered into a whole new perspective.  The movie and the books have prompted me to download a book on the History of South Africa.  OMG!  How did the world allow this Apartheid HORROR to go on as long as it did and right under our noses.  It was as horrific as the Nazi concentration camps; in fact, it was patterned after Nazi ideals and purifying of the races. . Why did it take 40++ years to abolish Apartheid?

3937862,5,B002JCSWVG,"Clint Eastwood' rarely delivers disappointment with the films he directs....this film i can assure you does not 'buck' the trend.
The film starts with 'Nelson Mandela's' (Morgan Freeman) release after '30' years imprisonment and of his rise to President.
However, how does he convince a nation to unite,he sets out to integrate both white and black in within his new Government.
But, many problems lie ahead, the white population are suspicious, and many of the black population remain less than equall.
The national 'Rugby' team are primarily supported by the white population, the opposition are usually cheered on by the black community.
So much division, 'Nelson Mandela' see's an opening that might get the whole country backing the national team during the World-Cup, the team do have a habit of losing however.
'Nelson Mandela' makes it a priority to befriend the 'rugby' captain 'Francois Pienar' (Matt Damon)and get to know the team by name.
This is a brilliantly up-lifting movie, and has obviously been researched to offer authenticity.
'Morgan Freeman' one of today's most respected actor's gives a convincing performance as the man who has the courage to forgive those who done him wrong.
'Matt Damon' an inspiring role as the 'Springbok' Captain who's team along with the presidents support helped unite that which had been divided---a Nation.
Clint Eastwood' has surely directed another 'classic in waiting'",1435449600,,1422,5.2687224669603525

3937874,5,B002JCSWVG,"This is one of those Movies whose subject matters belong in a DVD collection. Naturally it is about Nelson Mandela a very wise and intelligent man. I love this DVD and have seen it at least 3 times maybe more. After spending 29 years in Prison Nelson when released wanted to unite his Country for both indigenous AFRICAN BLACK AND THE AFRICANERS. He used the platform of Sports to unite a Country. He bore his incarceration with dignity and is esteemed well after his death. If I could speak to a person passed he would be one. He was I think both very wise and incredibly intelligent using his time in prison to improve his situation & he had plenty of time to think.
He is the father of South Africa because he forgave and that is a very powerful tool. Far better than engaging in further hostilities.
I also have 2 Documentaries on his life. It is very interesting to watch them, Morgan Freeman I thought he was a fantastic choice to play Mandela because Morgan has that quality not many have as an actor, He has a great deal of personal dignity and he did not fail in this Movie. Get it, watch it and see a master at work. This is in no way contrived, this is what he truly was a wise man who could do what that is to look beyond himself and try to engage all Citizens to be joined as one Nation the Republic of South Africa.
MATT DAMON was excellent as the Captain of the Rugby Team who achieved the impossible beyond all expectations and with great encouragement from Mandela. This in itself was a incredible achievement to win the World Games & at a pivotal time in History.",1432425600,2,1581,4.326599326599327

3937876,5,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus is a remarkable movie about one of the most remarkable national leaders of modern times, Nelson Mandela.  He developed an international reputation as a healer of the racial divide between the 90% population of indigent black peoples of South Africa and the 10% White Dutch and English Colonial conquerors of South Africa. He had come out of a three decade imprisonment on Robben Island and other Colonial prisons and after democratically winning the Presidency of South Africa became a healer of the cultural war between the White Minority and the Black Majority.
He begged the white colonial government workers to say in the government and made them his allies in what he called the ""Rainbow Coalition"", the multiracial government and society of the New South Africa that he helped to create.  He supported the national Rugby Team, the Springbok, and encouraged them to both keep their teem colors and to win the World Rugby Cup in 1996.  He found an ally in the Team Captain Franois, in this movie played by Matt Damon.
Nelson Mandela encouraged the South Africa  Springbok to keep their team colors and modified the South African flag to include several other colors, still keeping its overall shape.  He strongly discouraged any retaliation against the White Minority Population, even keeping the White Presidential Bodyguards of former White South African President C. F. DeKlerk.  He stated that, Forgiveness is our most powerful weapon and Franois became one of his strongest political as well as cultural supporters.
This is a remarkable story of two people who had been oppressor and oppressed getting over their past mutual animosity and forging a new society.
My own children had come to see Nelson Mandela as a cultural and political leader of the last part of the 20th Century and watching this film certainly gave me an opportunity to understand their admiration of him.",1431388800,3,1893,5.051282051282051

Morgan Freeman gives a good performance as Nelson Mandela, communicating well Mandela's grasp of his former jailers and enemies and how to begin to build a new nation from the horrors of apartheid. Matt Damon as the big Boer rugby captain Franois Pienaar, however is simply miscast. His effort to portray Pienaar is enthusiastic but he just isn't believable as a massive rugby player. Much of the power of the book (Playing the Enemy by John Carlin) is missing from the movie, but Mandela's incredible leadership is the focus and deservedly so.

3937903,4,B002JCSWVG,"President Mandela worked feverishly, the effects of physical exhaustion being monitored under the watchful eye of his doctor's care, to make a peaceful transition from the ruling apartheid white to a majority democracy. Of the 43 million South Africans, almost 90 percent are black or brown. The minority white are known as the Afrikaners, the dominant, ruling white tribe--apartheid's master race. The country was more polarized by racial division than any other in the world and all the elements were there, the stage was set for a civil war. Mandela describes apartheid as ""moral genocide""--the insidious extermination of people's self-respect.  To eliminate apartheid's oppression, he had to persuade white people to eliminate it themselves, to join his team, and to follow his leadership. Rugby was a white sport. Blacks abhorred, detested the rugby team, the Springboks or Boks, because they represented apartheid's debilitating brutality. Did that keep them from going to the games? The animosity was so entrenched that blacks would attend to root for, to cheer on, the opposing/visiting team. It was as if they enjoyed the game as a retaliatory, vindictive act, as schadenfreude when the foreign team beat the Springboks. Gradually, though, they, too, would become proud of and inspired by their team, the Springboks. The movie is how a dialectical Mandela, leading by example and being the change he wanted to see in others, by becoming the most staunch, resolute supporter of the Springboks, the all-white rugby team except for one member, Chester Williams, used this opportunity as a catalyst for racial reconciliation.

There is life, and hurt, and pain and human emotion, but they've all been crippled by, in my estimation, a lack of depth in the script. Freeman and Damon do a wonderful job with what they had to work with, they, and the script writers, were constrained by time. They just couldn't  make a four hour movie describing twisty political events all mixed up with all the human emotion, thought, viewpoints, political action.......... They did a wonderful job with the time constraints they had to accept.

That said, this is a powerful movie of building, healing, human love and respect. White cops responsible for years of racial subjugation, willingly putting their lives on the line for their Black political leader. Whom they had helped put in their prisons for a goodly portion of his life.

Spend the money, it will bring you a thoughtful, historically accurate bit of entrancing entertainment--and education... and even a bit of wishful thinking.",1421366400,,1058,4.866666666666666

3937936,5,B002JCSWVG,"INVICTUS is a brilliant and deeply moving, 133-minute movie by Warner Brothers Pictures, that is superbly Directed and Produced by Academy Award winner: Clint Eastwood. And stars, Actors: Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman. It chronicles and flawlessly depicts two actual accounts and simultaneously intertwines two true-life stories and the most unlikely of meetings, and how fate and history met at the crossroads of life for the saving of a President, a Nation and a People. In addition too, a Rugby Team by the name of Spingboks. Who? What? Where? When? And why? The President is Nelson Mandela. The Nation is South Africa. The People were the South African citizens and general populous. And after having been unjustly incarcerated for 27 years for spearheading the courageous fight against Apartheid in that Nation, on February 11th 1990 Counselor Nelson Mandela... finally and miraculously emerged a free man. As a gifted Attorney, he from his jail cell and then later while under house arrest, spoke to the hearts of his people so much so, that after his triumphant release from unwarranted bondage they elected him President of the South African Nation. Meaning, after much political upheaval, lives being lost and world attention to the atrocities that were being committed there, at long last..., the seemingly endless storm came to a victorious end. So, how would the South African Nation move forward and begin the healing process? By mixing sports and politics. Specifically, the winning of the Rugby Tournament Cup. Engaging Actor - Matt Damon stars, as the Rugby Team Captain who was invited to visit with the new President as portrayed by Academy Award winning Actor - Morgan Freeman, who encouraged him with a simple yet profound poem, entitled: INVICTUS. Based on endearing historical events, this film is a winner in more ways than one. It is a two-fold big-screen depiction of triumphant victory and vindication for President Nelson Mandela, as well as, for the entire Springboks Rugby Team and it's Captain. You will be on your feet cheering for them all, as the intense and liberating heartbeat of this enthralling film is felt through your viewing screen. This true-life account of survival and freedom in the midst of tremendous adversity is both, exhorting and edifying. And, nothing short of a true-life masterpiece. It comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD that is definitely an encouraging keeper. You can't help but be deeply moved! Nina Kish",1418342400,,2484,5.120689655172414

3937995,5,B002JCSWVG,The poem Invictus was one of my favorites from my youth.  to use it to poetry the South African ruler Mandela was ingenious.  Having grown up in the segregated United States of the late thirties and early forties it gave me an affinity to the situation of Mr. Mandela having the ability to over com his ordeal and lead his country at a time when it was at one of it's lowest ebbs.  Having been an avid Rugby player in the late 1950's with the British and the Chinese in the country of Taiwan I have a great appreciation for this sport.  As an avid golfer I am encouraged by the respect and appreciation that professional golfers from the Country of South Africa have shown to Mr. Mandela as the past leader of this Great country.,1405468800,,729,4.338235294117647

3938011,5,B002JCSWVG,"The film, Invictus, is based upon the book written by John Carlin, and stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar - the team leader of South Africa's predominately white (Afrikaner) national rugby team, the Springboks. It is an amazing story with a deeper lesson - Mandela's strategy to orchestrate a moment whereby the people of South Africa felt the unity that national pride can bring due to winning a Rugby World Cup. It reminds me of the fictional book (by Bryce Courtenay) & movie, The Power of One, also starring Freeman.  It, too, focuses on the unfairness & prejudice in South Africa during WWII.

Carlin's book, Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation, details the true story about Mandela's efforts to ease racial inequality in South Africa by touching the emotions of the people. Mandela not only convinced the white Afrikans rugby players (albeit one black player) to get on board as an important nation-building measure, but also managed to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup game against New Zealand.  The Springboks won the game and the people were one as a nation  . Mandela's maneuver united the fans of rugby and fostered better race relations because of it.  At least that is the gist of Carlin's book and Freeman's movie since he bought the book rights to make this movie.  In 1996, Francois Pienaar also wrote a book about this historical event in his memoir, Rainbow Warrior.

This movie invites viewers to enlighten themselves about the racial apartheid in South Africa and one man's attempt to eliminate it, even for a year, a month, one day.  Then too, the movie (and the book) describes the game of rugby, which is like a work of art in motion when well played. Watching a rugby game is exciting, viewers are emotionally engaged just witnessing the sheer strength & brute force exhibited by the players in a scrum. What an excellent idea Mandela had to try to bring South Africa together. Highly recommended!",1401840000,,1987,4.806451612903226

You do not have to be a sports fan to ""get"" this movie.  Morgan Freeman as Mandela admirably portrays the patience, strength , and boldness - above all understanding and fearless forgiveness required to be a leader in a divided nation.",1401235200,,412,4.774647887323944
3938014,5,B002JCSWVG,"This movie was very inspiring to watch.  It just shows that if you want to make this a better world, you need to keep our eyes on your goal and not be petty or vengeful.  Win your enemies over by being forgiving and remember how to do that by reading  and remembering this little quote that I like:  ""They drew a circle and drew me out, a heretic, a thing to flout, but love and I had the wits to win, I drew a circle and drew them in.""  Totally a wonderful story on how to conquer with love.

Flout means 'to treat with contemptuous disregard.'one who dissents from an accepted belief.' People would flout you if you believe that you should treat black Africans in a way they don't agree with such as during Apartide.

Heretic means 'one who dissents from an accepted belief.'  In this case it would mean believing that black people are not worthy of being treated with respect or honoring them as equals.",1401062400,,906,4.351190476190476

3938030,5,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus is an excellent film tribute to both the late Nelson Mandela, who assumed the South African presidency in 1994 after 27 years in prison, and to Morgan Freeman who portrayed Mr. Mandela so realistically.  After years of post-WWII enforced racial segregation (known as apartheid), South Africa finally bowed to international and internal pressures and abolished the apartheid laws, granting universal suffrage that resulted in the election of South Africa's first black president by a wide majority.  President Mandela, admirably non-vindictive in spite of his lengthy punishment by the apartheid state,  feared for ongoing inter-racial friction, and befriended the (mostly white) national rugby team, the Springboks, and particularly its captain Franois Pienaar (splendidly portrayed by Matt Damon), to assist with racial integration by the promotion of rugby to the black community.  In particular he urged the Springboks to go all out to win the 1995 world cup, which they did after a bruising final match in Capetown with New Zealand's world-famous national team.  To watch this fine film is to gain an appreciation of the human spirit in the face of adversity on several different levels.  If you don't know much about rugby football it is a very good primer, and it is excellent testimony to the power of forgiveness.",1397779200,,1330,5.309523809523809

3938032,5,B002JCSWVG,Invictus is a solid movie that shows how Nelson Mandela used the sport of rugby and forgiveness to build a post-apartheid South Africa.,1396828800,,135,4.913043478260869

3938034,5,B002JCSWVG,"Morgan takes his role as Nelson Mandela very seriously and he shines.  This true story kept this gal in sniffles as we learn about this amazing leader and the challenges of dissolving the South African Apartheid.  It's also amazing how true it is that sports bring people together.  Throw in cute Damon who must have spent the whole year working out - whoa the pecks - and character actors that work well together and you've got a fine movie, plot and lesson in life.",1394928000,,467,4.535714285714286

3938048,5,B002JCSWVG,Was a really interesting movie that seems mostly accurate. Such an interesting story because in the face of hate wisdom turns the tide with love surprising all the people in the movie and surely nearly everyone in the country at the time. A real winner.,1393718400,,253,4.644444444444445

Portion is not sufficient",1393027200,,119,4.714285714285714
3938053,3,B002JCSWVG,I rated the movie 3 stars because I felt the movie did a good job of portraying the squalor that the Blacks lived in and  the racism that still existed after Mandela became President. I think the movie dragged in a few places and I didn't feel the intensity during the final soccer game.,1392854400,,287,4.314814814814815
3938054,4,B002JCSWVG,Great story of Nelson Mandela and his struggle to unite his country and keep it from civil war. A must see!!,1392854400,,108,4.190476190476191

3938056,5,B002JCSWVG,Very interesting movie. Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman are such great actors! The only thing that I would call out is that they don't have subtitles for some of the dutch or South African English that the actors used which made it impossible to understand the context at times....,1392595200,,279,4.714285714285714
3938057,5,B002JCSWVG,This is a great movie that provides a snipet of who Mandela was and why he was important. I use this movie to show to all of my students and they love it!...Very Inspiring!!,1392336000,,173,4.117647058823529

3938059,4,B002JCSWVG,This is a well acted bio pic that shows the strength of character Mandela had. This is a great movie.,1392249600,,101,4.1
3938060,5,B002JCSWVG,The movie gives an in depth view of Nelson's life without a documentary form for school. Going to use it in racial segregation lessons.,1392163200,,135,4.666666666666667

3938064,5,B002JCSWVG,"The first time I saw this movie, I did not understand it - what Mandela was trying to do when he was raising up the soccer team and how he planned to use them to halt apartheid in South Africa.  I heard it talked about when he passed away, then I saw the movie again - what a brilliant, moving man he was.  There will never be another.  I'm sure Mandela is getting his just rewards in Heaven as I write this!  What a blessing he was to his country.",1391817600,,448,3.9444444444444446

3938066,4,B002JCSWVG,"Morgan Freeman's great and overall it's a step above all those sentimental sports movies, because its focus is actually more on politics and what political move is most appropriate than it is about just rugby. Still don't think Matt Damon should've gotten an Oscar nod though.",1391644800,,276,5.021739130434782

3938070,4,B002JCSWVG,"I thought Freeman and Damon's portrayals of their characters were excellent, they both had me believing. The only fault I found was the confusion over the game itself, maybe a little more explanation about how it's rules and how they play the game , might have helped North american audiences relate better. Still, well paced and a inspiring story.",1390348800,,348,4.915254237288136

3938072,5,B002JCSWVG,"As a one who grew up as a child in the US south, I recognized the treatment of blacks by whites in this film and was overwhelmed at the true story of how one man changed history by refusing to hate and using a national pastime to unite a country.",1390348800,,246,3.94
3938073,5,B002JCSWVG,This is certainly not an all-encompassing story of Nelson Mandela's life but it does provide a great window into his life and the cast could not have been better for the characters.,1390262400,,181,4.6875
3938074,5,B002JCSWVG,I very much enjoyed this inspiring movie and I believe so does a former housekeeper because the DVD disappeared from my collection just after President Mandela passed. This disc is a replacement.,1390262400,,195,5.125

3938076,5,B002JCSWVG,"This was a great movie. It combined an exciting sports film with a historical drama. In the film Nelson Mandela uses South Africa's national rugby team to pull together the Africans (blacks) and the Afrikaners (whites) just after the end of apartheid. Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman star in two different narratives that come together in the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. The movie reminded me a the 1980's film Victory with Silvester Stallone, Michael Cain and of course Pele, where Allied prisoners of war play soccer against a Nazi team. We watched it as an assignment from my son's high school geography teacher. Good choice!",1390262400,,636,4.898148148148148

3938080,5,B002JCSWVG,"You really can't lose with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon,  but,  this will leave you with warm fuzzies.

And,  for $1.99 on Prime,  a jewel.",1390089600,,335,4.719298245614035
3938081,4,B002JCSWVG,I liked the story but was hoping to learn more about what Nelson Mandela did to unite and govern the country after he was elected. I understand that he felt that rugby was an important part of unification but what did he do to improve the lives of the poor besides give them pride in their rugby team. This is why I didn't give Invictus 5 stars and only gave it 4.,1389744000,,364,4.069444444444445

3938092,4,B002JCSWVG,This movie has nothing to do w/ sports. It is more about freedom in S. Africa.  As an admirer of Mandela since the '60's I wanted more of him as the soft spoken person he was. Don't get me wrong. Soft spoken does not mean soft. He was a strong person. Morgan Freeman depicted Mandela well. One of the few movies I've watched all the way though.

stunning performance as Mandela. When asked how he can support the almost all White Springboks rugby team he says ""How can I expect other people. To change if I can't change myself.""

It seemed to fall in the middle between being about Mandela and being a sports film, and not fully satisfying expectations in either direction.  To go back and see it now, at a time when Mandela is near death, is a quite different experience.  Freeman makes a great Mandela, and the film captures his concern with reconciliation and forgiveness.  And for those of us who understand the game of Rugby, Damon's depiction of the South African team captain, Francois Pienaar, is also deeply moving and takes this film way beyond something like ""Remember the Titans.""  This is definitely time to revisit ""Invictus""!",1372550400,,685,4.870689655172414

These are two actors who rarely overdo it, and that reserve works to brilliant effect here. We watched it with our children, aged 8 & 10, and they also really enjoyed it. The film prompted many questions from them about South Africa's history, particularly its racial history, and this was a very good thing indeed. We were able to tell them all about Nelson Mandela (they even looked him up online themselves) AND it has made our son interested in rugby (which is not widely played where we live in the New Hampshire sticks).

Yet I found that this movie was about much more than rugby. I was awed at how Nelson Mandela was able to use a team (sport) that was hated by many in South Africa as a way to unite the country. This movie shows that reconcilation and forgiveness is possible no matter how dark the situation seems at the time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in sports as well as in history. My respect for Mandela has increased significantly since watching Invictus.

3938214,5,B002JCSWVG,"""Invictus"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: The true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of South Africa's rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite their country. Newly elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially and economically divided in the wake of apartheid. Believing he can bring his people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela rallies South Africa's underdog rugby team as they make an unlikely run to the 1995 World Cup Championship match.

The cast led by Morgan Freeman (who also executive produced) (impressive as Nelson Mandela) & Matt Damon (excellent as Francois Pienaar) is excellent! The directing by Clint Eastwood (who also produced) (who, recently starred, produced and directed ""Gran Torino"" (2008) is excellent! The screenplay (based on John Carlin's book) by Anthony Peckham (who also did the screenplay to ""Don't Say A Word"" (2001) & the upcoming ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) is excellent!

The music by Kyle Eastwood & Michael Stevens (who also did the music to ""Gran Torino"" & ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" (2006, another Clint Eastwood film) is excellent! The cinematography by Tom Stern (who also did the cinematography to Eastwood's films since ""Blood Work"" (2002) is excellent! The film editing by Joel Cox (who has been doing the film editing to Eastwood's films since ""The Enforcer"" (1976) & Gary Roach (who has been doing the film editing to Eastwood's films since ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") is excellent! The casting by Fiona Weir (who also did the casting to ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"" (2005), ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" (2007), ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"" (2010 & 2011) is excellent! The production design by James J. Murakami (who has been doing the production design to Eastwood's films since ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") is excellent! The art direction by Tom Hannam (supervising art director) & Jonathan Hely-Hutchinson (who also did the art direction to ""Amelia"" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Leon Van Der Merwe is excellent! The costume design by Deborah Hopper (who has been doing the costume design to Eastwood's films since ""Space Cowboys"" (2000) is excellent!

3938219,5,B002JCSWVG,"Another masterwork for director Clint Eastwood. This might be his finest achievement in the directors chair to date. The entire film is briliantly directed. I think Eastwood took not only his biggest gamble ever with Invictus but he also created a very enjoyable and emotional story out of a point in history most of us in the United States knew little or nothing about. It seemed like an impossible task for Eastwood and Malpaso to make a great film about Mandelas new presidency while backdropping the story about how Mandela used rugby to bring his nation together in a new a brighter unity, and still do it effectivly and keep it insteresting. Here Eastwood pulled it off and managed to create a truly dramatic film that touches the heart and the soul. Its a wonderful and inspirational story. Morgan Freeman was astounding as Mandela. He should have earned the oscar for his perfectly rendered portrtrait of Mandela. His work is breathtaking and beautiful here. Before I saw this film I had no interest in sports or considered the idea that a sport could have such an effect on an entire nation. After I saw this film I gained a new admiration for such subjects. Eastwood has done an incredible job with this film. It didn't win the oscars that Unforgiven did, but in some ways it deserved to. This was indeed a much more mammoth undertaking than any film Eastwood has ever directed, and for a director at his age it really is astonishing how good a film he was able to make here.

It shows how much he sacrificed in his personal life to fight for equal rights and how forgiving and gracious he was after he was freed from prison. Though everyone was now free, there were still deep emotional wounds that needed to heal. Mr. Mandela felt that the South African ruby team would be a catalyst to help bring the nation together. And the rest, they say, is history... though, for this movie, really is the case.

The movie is not dark enough, and the character development was not deep enough.  The characters that I knew most at the end of the movie were the security guards, and they are minor characters compared to Mandela and Damon's characters.  It should have told more of the apartheid story, and should have gotten deeper into the racism aspect.  I was happy at the end, however I didn't think it was sad enough.  They get in-to Mandela's sad past a little bit, but they just scratch the surface.  This movie would have been really great if it was about half an hour later and showed more drama and history.

3938231,4,B002JCSWVG,"I have very little time for politicians, I'm not a fan of rugby, and I know very little about South Africa. However, I do think that Clint Eastwood makes a lot of important films, and I enjoy the acting of Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. That's why I decided to watch Invictus when it was released on Blu-ray four years ago.

Mandela was occasionally in the news during my childhood, but events happening on another continent meant very little to me as a young boy. As an adult, I have come to appreciate people who sacrificed much of their lives in an attempt to change the way people think. If you connected with Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, try to imagine a similar scenario in the modern world.

Mandela campaigned against apartheid, and was imprisoned for his actions in 1963. He spent 18 of his 27 years in prison on Robben Island, where he contracted tuberculosis. As I write this review, he's in hospital with pneumonia at the age of 94.

Invictus shows some of the challenges faced by Mandela when he became South Africa's first black president in 1994. He defied expectations at every turn. An early scene gives us a clue about the man as he calls together his staff. Some of them are white, and expecting to be fired, but Mandela urges them to stay and continue to serve their country. He wants to forgive those who imprisoned him, and those who hate black South Africans. He realized that he was in a position to lead by example, and that it wasn't the time to settle old scores. Freeman's portrayal provides insight into Mandela's character, and shows us why he was loved by the people with whom he interacted.

Racism is one of the most dangerous things in existence, and I believe that it will always be with us in some form. There is no logic in hating someone because of their color or origin, but we are still surrounded by people who do just that. I think it's incredibly ignorant to continue to hold such beliefs in modern society, but I won't turn this review into a debate about racism. I mention it because it's important to frame the story, and appreciate what Mandela was trying to do.

So why is rugby an integral part of the story?

When Mandela took office, South Africa had already been chosen to host the rugby world cup a year later. Mandela decided to use the occasion to help to unite South Africans in a common cause. Rugby had always been a game revered by white South Africans, while black South Africans preferred soccer. In fact, the black population frequently cheered for whichever team was playing their national team as a form of protest. Overcoming that level of hatred proved to be quite a challenge.

Matt Damon plays South African Springbok captain, Francois Pienaar. He leads a team that is suffering from lack of belief in its own ability. There's a definite parallel between Mandela's efforts to unite the country, and Pienaar's task of uniting his team, the fans, and the media. Mandela meets him to discuss the importance of performing well in the world cup, and the two talk about leadership techniques.

Invictus is an engaging story which appeals as a historical drama more than a movie about sports. You don't need to know anything about rugby in order to appreciate the story. Eastwood has constructed a film that deals with the weighty subject matter in a way that we can all understand. Freeman was deservedly nominated for his performance, and Damon is convincing as a rugby player.

Films like this may be considered too idealistic by many, but it works for me. I realize that uniting a country is more difficult than the events portrayed on the screen over the course of two hours. What Invictus does is encourage me to think beyond my immediate surroundings, and appreciate some of the things faced by people living in other countries. It's not the best film ever made about politics or sports, but it's definitely worth your time if you want to broaden your horizons.",1364688000,,3928,4.656565656565657

I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that Freeman delivers a flat Mandela, but I think that is overshadowed by the story. It's a fascinating tale of how a man that led the resistance to apartheid used rugby to help unite whites and blacks as South Africans. Yes, Mandela was more than that, but this is a window into his suffering and how his mind worked. If all you see is rugby, you miss the point. If what you see is how a man used his prison time to know himself, heal himself and use that knowledge to bring the same to others, you will enjoy this movie.

This movie is a great idea and the true story is a great story, but this movie stinks, and I hate to say that because I am both a big Eastwood fan and a big Mat Damon fan.

The movie looks more like a made-for-tv movie than a major motion picture, the lighting, the sets and the costumes are all poorly done.

The script is more like a rough draft and it seems to lead one to believe Nelson Mandela's only concern was rugby. What a massive trivialization of a very important world event!!!

Damon attempts to do his best with a character who is meant to be important to the movie but without any character developmnet and even less good lines.

Morgan Freeman is given little to work with from the script and his accent is poor at best.

The worst thing about the movie is the direction. This is Eastwood's worst film. It looks like it was directed by an adult movie director with a low budget. Uninspired. Uninspired. Uninspired.

I hate to say it but I am guessing Eastwood will not be making any more great films. I hope I am wrong but this film is more than just not that good, it is a failure on every level.",1349827200,3,1271,4.24896265560166

3938271,4,B002JCSWVG,"Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon plays Franois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby team. In 1995, they won the World Cup.

OK, so I don't normally pay much attention to sports movies. But I love both principal actors, and Mandela is one of my heroes. So I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.

Apparently rugby is sort of like American football without all the padding. All I knew of it before this was that when I was at the University of Michigan, the rugby team was the toughest bunch of SOBs I'd ever met. They were all human bulldogs. Now I know that they had to be to play the game, let alone win it.

Before the end of apartheid, South African blacks were in the habit of rooting for any team that played against the Springboks, the all-white South African team. By 1994, they had exactly one black player. Mandela realized that putting the country together was going to take more than laws prohibiting discrimination. It was going to take people coming together willingly. He correctly realized that a winning rugby team could do that.

The black kids mostly played soccer (called ""football"" outside of America), partly because the Springboks were so hated. But at Mandela's suggestion, Pienaar took the team on good will tours to the small towns and taught the kids to play rugby. They loved it, and started cheering for the Springboks when they started winning big.

The movie does not make it clear exactly what made the Bokke turn into such a good team from what had been a rather pathetic one, except to suggest that Pienaar drove them harder than they'd been driven before. But he had been captain through their ho-hum years, so that's not a very satisfying explanation.

The final game, which was against New Zealand, could make a rugby fan out of anyone, even me. It was an amazing game in several respects, and Clint Eastwood is just the director to make it comprehensible. Several of the decisive plays are done in slow motion, which I suppose makes up for the TV instant replay habit.

Before the game, the New Zealand team does a Maori war dance, which is every bit as intimidating as they intend it to be. But it is rather odd to see what are clearly white players (although their biggest and meanest looks like a native) doing a chant and coordinated dance.

I enjoyed the movie, for all its flaws, and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is generally a sports fan. Even if you're not, you may surprise yourself.

P.S. The title of the movie is the title of a poem I memorized in sixth grade. We were each told to choose one to memorize, and I chose this strong-minded one to try to improve my courage. Did it work? I don't really know.",1336694400,,2700,4.516393442622951

Of course the master craftsman, Morgan Freeman played Nelson to a T...what a great portrayal. But I also believe that Matt Damon's Pienaar was well done as well...they both went to the characters they were to play and sat with them, talked to them, drank them in and mimicked them reflective of their pride in the craft of acting.  Add to that the eye for detail and surround of Clint Eastwood...to me the film gave an authenticity to the times, the conflict, the confusion and yet also, the desire to be seen as a country of stature, moving forward.

3938284,4,B002JCSWVG,"During his 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela regularly turned to a poem Called Invictus, and found profound inspiration.

During his time as President he continued to turn to this poem, and knowing it by heart, wrote it out long hand, and to the Captain of the Sprinboks passed it, who found profound inspiration.

During my life, I found profound inspiration in Nelson Mandela, and if a man can live in the unfair divided regime called apartheid, can spend so much time in prison, and emerge wise instead of rancorous, and can become president of a nation so divided, it raises the bar of human possibility, and inspires us to do better. If Mandela can solve the unsolvable problems of South Africa, if the Berlin Wall can fall, then cannot my own country's problem be solved, could there be peace in Nothern Ireland. All of these things which once seemed impossible have come to pass.

And Invictus the movie invites us to see Mandela in elegant action, uniting a divided nation, averting civil unrest and civil war, reviving the sport of apartheid (rugby), saving the Springboks from being disbanded, and playing a pivotal role in inspiring their triumphs.

Clint and Morgan, between them have won numerous Academy Awards on their previous collaborations. Morgan Freeman won best Supporting Actor for Million Dollar Baby playing Clint's sidekick, and played Clint's sidekick in Unforgiven.

Morgan Freeman impresses as Mandela, who he knows personally, and does an outstanding job. As much if not more is conveyed through a nod, a gesture and a facial expression than through words. Matt Damon impresses as the Rugby Captain. Having played rugby myself, he totally convinces in his body language and movement as a rugby player.

Clint Eastwood does an impressive job outside his normal territory and familiar genre, making the rugby scenes very true to life. Usually the cameras are off field, here they are up close and personal in the thick of the action.

My one critique of the movie is that it lacks something Hollywood likes, namely the conflict, drama, and the hubris of the characters.

In Changeling for example, Christine Collins has to overcome great adversity, and transform from a mom mourning her missing child to an activist, even being committed to a psychiatric hospital because she disagreed with the police captain.

In Invictus, the great Nelson Mandela adversity has already happened before the events of this movie happen, so the great dramas of his life remain unexplored, and the drama of his wife Winnie being charged with murder also remains unexplored. A quality movie made about all that, would surely win many awards.

Invictus remains a great movie, it's funny sometimes, it's gripping, it's inpiring, it's even exciting. Although it's Morgan Freeman's movie, it's Eastwood's humor that's pervasive. It's a slice of Mandela, but not the whole cake.

Trivia. Watch out for the other Eastwoods, Kyle scores the music. Scott, scores the winning points, and plays No. 10 for the Springboks. Invictus means, unconquerable, invincible. I hope this was helpful to you.",1323648000,,3095,5.060903732809431

3938286,5,B002JCSWVG,"This is a very good and moving story. After spending 27 years in a very small cell in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was released and he was elected president of his country in 1990. But he had a serious problem. Not only he, but all the blacks in South Africa had been despised, oppressed, and terribly mistreated their entire lives. Many lived in dirty unhygienic shacks. They were poor. They were very angry. The whites retained their prejudicial attitudes. They kept their idea that they were superior. They believed that only they could rule the country. They felt that ""ignorant blacks"" would ruin their land.

How could the new president unite the people of his country? How could he start afresh? What could he take away from the white oppressors without increasing their anger? What could he give the blacks? How could he inspire his nation? How could he get the world to respect South Africa?

 Nelson Mandela devised the idea that he might unite his people by having both blacks and whites join together in hoping that the South African Rugby Team would win the 1995 World Cup. But the problem was that the team was not that good. How could he improve the team? This movie tells the story of what he did and the results.",1321228800,3,1229,4.628440366972477

I really enjoy the movie. I'm going to to give it 4 out of 5 stars. Worth renting and I am planning on buying it. Clint Eastwood directs Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon in this South African sports thriller. Nelson Mandela (played by Freeman) becomes President of a post-civil war South Africa and gambles his political career on the South African Rugby Team, Captained by Francois Pienaar (played by Damon). Madela is the protagonist and leads an awesome band of actors and actresses. The spectacle of the movie comes at perfect times during the rugby matches. Mandela is faced with the problem of uniting a country and faces it head on. The title, Invictus, is a short Victorian poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The poem was Mandela's inspiration while in prison for twenty seven years. Pienaar plays a great sidekick to Manedla, he becomes inspired by Mandela's unconditional faith in the team to win the world cup. I recommend this movie for all ages, it is great movie for families as well as thrill seekers.

3938292,4,B002JCSWVG,I may think of this film in such a favorable light because I watched it right after a trip to South Africa. The film does feature the stark contrast between the haves and have nots within the absolutely stunning nation.  While the movie is about Rugby it also has a huge deal to do with the history of South Africa in the post-apartheid era.,1315872000,,341,4.328125
3938293,5,B002JCSWVG,"Unfortunately being focused on and concerned about our economy, and continuing war against terrorism the majority of Americans know very little about the nation of South Africa, and the almost miraculous achievements of Nelson Mandela. Invictus is a brilliant biographical/sports drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. The story is based on the John Carlin book ""Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation"" centered on events in South Africa before and during the 1995 Rugby World Cup, hosted in that country following the dismantling of apartheid regime. Freeman and Damon play, South African President Nelson Mandela and Franois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby union team the Springboks.  The title Invictus is translated from Latin as unconquered, and is the title of a poem by English poet William Ernest Henley (1849-1903).

This is the true story of a man who was released after almost three decades in the harsh prisons of South Africa and that was to assume leadership of the nation that had imprisoned him. His personal forgiveness of white South Africa was the torch that illuminated that nation's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions. This being one of the very few examples in world history of a nations people who have actually made personal, and political efforts to address, forgive, and pardon the many brutal, and murderous actions of both sides in the struggle for freedom, and democracy. While Mandela attempts to tackle the country's biggest problems such as crime, unemployment, civil unrest, and international relations he watches a game of the Springboks, the national rugby team. Mandela knows that the blacks in the stadium always cheer against their home team, as the Springboks, and their team colors represent prejudice, and apartheid in their minds. Mandela remembers that he too did the same while imprisoned for 17 years on Robben Island. Many South Africans, both white and black, doubt that the rugby team will unite a nation torn apart by over half a century of racial segregation, conflict, and prejudice. For many non-whites, especially the ANC black leftist radicals, the Springboks symbolize white supremacy. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the international 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela is faced with the problem on whether or not to support or disband the faltering team. It is then that he decideds to meet with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, Franois Pienaar  (Matt Damon), and questions whether a Springboks victory in the World Cup might unite and inspire their nation. Mandela perceives Francois to be of good heart and character, and shares with him a poem, ""Invictus"", that had inspired him during his long lonely time in prison. Can and will Mandela's and Pienaars belief and stance behind their theory that this team can successfully unite the country prevail?  Could any nation obsessed by its national sport whether it is soccer, basketball, baseball, football or its standing in the World Olympics be able to unify, and redeem itself before a world audience?

Clint Eastwood seems to have always had the unusual ability to understand the many irrational aspects of human emotion, and existence. Despite the numerous books, documentaries, and historical pieces written about South Africa it is he alone that has managed to make a wonderful, inspiring film about this important historical event, and its consequences. Morgan Freeman (who personally met, and befriended Mandela) does a great job of evoking the man Nelson Mandela, who is as much a secular saint of Africa as Gandhi of India is perceived to be. He portrays him as a cordial, confident, balanced yet strong personality.  Matt Damon gives what I believe to be the best performance of his career playing the tough, dedicated rugby captain, Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner, child of racism, transformed by his contact with Mandela. Clint Eastwood, the masterful director, orchestrates, and directs one of the best movies of his long career and has us loving Mandela, proud of Francois and cheering for the gutsy, energized Springboks rugby team. This film could have gone bad in so many ways, it could have been too long, too preachy, too overacted, too over stated, instead it is a film that that is based on historical fact, both heartwarming, and inspiring in its message. It is wonderful entertainment, and a film whose significance concerning the ethical beliefs, and motives of a great leader should be a guideline for the rest of us to follow.",1315440000,,4575,5.117804551539491

3938297,5,B002JCSWVG,"It has been an awfully long time since I have been wowed by a movie.  But that was precisely my reaction to the new Clint Eastwood film ""Invictus"" which debuted in theaters across America today.
""Invictus"" recalls the 1995 Rugby World Cup tourney which was held in South Africa.  The World Cup was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa following the end of apartheid.  But this is by no means a movie about rugby.  Rather it is the compelling story about the courage and vision of two men....two very different men.

Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) was the recently elected President of South Africa.  Here was a man who had spent most of his adult life courageously opposing the entrenched system of legal racial seperation in his beloved homeland known as ""aparteheid"".  Mandela had certainly paid a stiff price for his divergent political views.  In the late 1950's and early 1960's he was an anti-apartheid activist, and the leader of the African National Congress's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe.  Mandela was loathed by the entrenched British establishment that was searching for ways to get rid of him once and for all.  Mandela was tried and conviced of sabotage and other crimes against the state by the prevailing National Party back in 1963.  Despite persistent calls for his release from political and religious leaders and from governments around the world Mandela would spend the next 27 years of his life in a prison cell.  While incarcerated Mandela read extensively and had plenty of time to ponder his philosophy of life.  He envisioned  that one day South Africa would become a color-blind ""Rainbow Nation"".  Mandela was finally released from prison in 1990 and in 1994 he was elected President of South Africa.  Shortly after his inauguration  President Mandela cast about for innovative ways to bring his disjointed nation together again.  He determined that the 1995 Rugby World Cup tournament to be held in his homeland to be the perfect vehicle to achieve his lifelong dream of a truly united South Africa.

Meanwhile, Francois Pineaar (Matt Damon) was the captain of the South African Rugby team known as Springbok.  The team was not very good and there was but one black man on the club.  Springbok's prospects in the upcoming tourney were dismal.  Yet with the odds clearly stacked against him Mandela decided to  gamble most of his political capital and personal prestige and made it a national priority to win the World Cup.  He met with Pineaar several months before the competition.  Although from very different backgrounds the two men quickly discovered that they were kindred spirits.  Each was bound and determined to make this ""impossible dream"" become a reality.

Although Matt Damon's star shines brightly in ""Invictus"" Morgan Freeman clearly steals this show.  I found it to be be one of those rare performances where I could simply not take my eyes off him.  He was that compelling!  I would compare Freeman's performance in this film to Jimmy Stewart's in ""Rear Window"" or perhaps more precisely to George C. Scott in ""Patton"".  ""Invictus"" is an extremely well-crafted and uplifting film that should earn numerous Oscar nominations. Clint Eastwood has outdone himself this time.  I would highly recommend this film to everyone!!",1310342400,,3291,4.992647058823529

3938299,5,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus depicts the beginning of Nelson Mandela's presidency and efforts to reunited post-Apartheit South Africa through support of their rugby team, the Springboks. After the white-supported team was disbanded for poor performance by the newly-black-controlled South African Sports Union, in his first main expenditure of political power, Mandela argues for their reinstatement as a measure to solidify the country's blacks and whites into one population. The film follows Mandela's effort to inspire the Springboks and team captain Franois Pienaar through his stories of personal struggle and his wisdom, turning around their season and getting a shot at the Rugby World Cup. A central theme is Mandela's compassion to the country's white population and efforts to bring the country together. Although Freeman's American accent slips through in a few places, it's a believably warming and bright tale which leaves the viewer feeling satisfied and enlightened.",1304208000,,962,5.6875
3938300,3,B002JCSWVG,"Overall, this is an amazingly inspirational story, filled with beating the odds of rebuilding unity in a country rife with separation.  However, they failed at bringing the incredible moving story, the full stretch, to the screen.
This is a true story, based on Nelson Mandella becoming President of South Africa, and the decisions he made, specifically to support and promote the Rugby team, with the idea that it would help bring both sides of his country, blacks and whites, together for the first time.
I should have been blown away by this movie. I should have laughed and cried my heart out, and I'm not even into sports.  But I didn't.  This movie did not MOVE me, and I find that incredibly disappointing.
I found the writing lacking in delivering a script that brought, what must have been, such a dramatic turmoil to the screen. The characters were not well developed, nor was their portrayel, by very talented actors, believable. They seemed somewhat lifeless, which leads me back to the writer (of the script and perhaps the book, which I have not read), and the director.
The directing was at time confusing, especially on the rugby field, because it was hard to figure out what was going on.  A non-sports fan, should be able to watch a sports movie, and still understand what's going on.  I didn't have a problem understanding other sports movies, like The Natural, Coach Carter, Remember The Titans, etc. The final match, did not build up emotionally with the shots, major let down.  Also, the shots in the movie, weren't building up, heightening the emotion. I have never been particularly impressed with Mr. Eastwood's directioning, and this movie was no exception.  Of course, the writer didn't help either.
I agree with another Reviewer, who said the movie struggles to find itself, is it a sports movie or is it about President Mandella.
So, while it is a movie worth watching, based on the historical aspect, just don't except a heart pull like perhaps The Blind Side.",1302307200,,1990,4.8352941176470585

3938307,2,B002JCSWVG,"I thought this movie was going to be similar to other ""feel-good"" sports movies. Sadly, Invictus is no Rudy, The Natural nor Remember the Titans.

I understand the importance of the events this movie covers. I understand how monumental it was for South Africa to rally behind their rugby team as it wins the World Cup. But I didn't feel any kind of emotional connection with either Morgan Freeman or Matt Damon.

Freeman plays Mandela as he becomes President and attempts to forge forgiveness in his country. Damon plays the team captain of a struggling rugby team.

The two meet up for tea and discuss how important it is that the team wins the World Cup. That's the thrust of the movie. There could have been some monumental scenes dealing with the struggles of racial tension and there are a few moments.

But the characters feel flat. I didn't care if this team did well. I didn't see Damon rally his teammates like he needed to. It felt plain flat.

Then you have the technical aspect of this film. Director Clint Eastwood felt the need to repeatedly show us the size of the World Cup crowd in a CG arena. One or two swooping shots would have been enough. After 5 or 6 times, it begins to feel like a gimmick. I'm not longer impressed with the computer shots.

3938310,3,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus (2009) is the story of South African President Nelson Mandela's journey to unite his country through the sport of rugby when he was first elected. It's an important historical story for South Africa and the world. And yet in the hands of gifted director Clint Eastwood, I just didn't feel that importance in this movie. I wanted to get those same feelings that great sports movies like Hoosiers (1986), Rudy (1993), and The Blind Side (2009) convey. But something was missing from this effort. You could argue that Invictus isn't really a sports movie and that it's a character story about Nelson Mandela. But if it's not a sports movie, then what is it? Because its got an awful lot of sports in it. Maybe that's the whole problem with this film...it just doesn't know what it is. Sometimes that works for a movie, but not this one. I give it 3 stars out of 5.

There is some filmmaking craftsmanship in Invictus that we see in the production design, cinematography, and acting for this film. Although the cinematography seems a bit underwelming compared to Eastwood's other films of the past decade. What I think this film is mainly lacking is direction and story/plot. I never felt like the movie was really going anywhere other than where I knew it was going...a big win on the rugby field. But that wasn't enough to give me the payoff I was looking for. And while Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon try to convey aspects of who their characters are, I just didn't connect with either character. They felt too forced. I did think Morgan Freeman was completely believable as Nelson Mandela, but I didn't care enough for his cause. Maybe I needed to understand more of the pain and experience of his imprisonment and the country's racism to feel passionately about what he was up to as President? I'm not totally sure what more could be done with this story. I just know that it didn't connect with me like I hoped for. But the film is worth watching at home on DVD/Bluray or on one of the premium movie channels where I saw it recently. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it struggles to rise above its mediocrity as just a ""good"" film.",1292889600,,2147,4.562176165803109
3938311,4,B002JCSWVG,"As part of his program to inspire Franois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon, the captain of the South African rugby team; Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, inculcates upon him an piece of literary wisdom that had inspired him to endure his 27 year imprisonment. During that time, Mandela learned all he could about the white people who had put him there by mastering their language and reading their books. In the process, he found a 19th Century poem which embodied the ""unconquerable soul"". This famous poem, from which the movie derives it's name, ends with these lines: ""I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul"". The power and conviction of this poem moved Nelson Mandela and helped direct his life and goals.

In the movie, as apparently in life, Mandela, now as President of South Africa, develops an equally unconquerable passion for the national sport of rugby, which he uses to unite his country. The Springboks, a mostly white team, are cheered on by the white South Africans, but soundly ""booed"" by the blacks because of what they represent. However, Mandela sets about to change all that. His obsession with the sport and modus operandi tend to bewilder both his staff as well as his fellow black countrymen. Yet it is revealed it to be a brilliant move for Mandela, the struggling team, and for the whole country, both black and white. His impressively forgiving attitude toward the white power is demonstrated when he, for example, invites Franois Pienaar to the presidential office for tea and takes him under his wing. Will he have the power to set this poetry in motion and lead to victory? That is the question that this film answers.

I give this film 4 stars for the inspirational story, yet I personally find it to be rather syrupy, predictable and lacking in depth. For example, none of the real racial tension which could have made it more believable and powerful is seen in this movie. Nelson Mandela himself was no Mahatma Gandhi, but there was only one slight hint in this movie that he was less than a saint. Morgan Freedman played this role masterfully, though I found the Matt Damon character to be rather bland. So if you are just looking for a feel-good movie, without all the ugly reality, this is a good choice.",1292198400,,2263,4.697732997481109

Purchase it and share it with your children, your friends and strangers on the street. Perhaps the most important question raised by Invictus is: How do you change the world?

Once done personally, he could lead a movement with great dignity that could prove to be invincible by others.

3938326,2,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus is a failure in of the key elements of filmmaking: Make the audience care. As an American, this was going to be no easy task. We don't know the first thing about Rugby, Eastwood doesn't really present the sport well, and what's worse is that he doesn't really present the events well. I came into the film being interested in the subject after studying it, and what happened before the events of most of this movie. The movie spends all of 30 seconds on this, thus giving no real context on why this is all important. But if they'd done that, it would have been hard to be invested anyways. It's a sports movie, but it's not a sports movie, but it uses all the cliches of one. The result is a very fine balance the movie has to walk, but it ends up tripping over. When speaking of a portrayal of this subject matter, cheesy should NEVER be something you use to describe it at any point during the proceedings, but cheesy is the word I'd use here more times than not, especially when it comes to the music.

There's a song called ""Colorblind"" that plays in the middle of the movie that gives us the heftiest dose of unintentional cheese. The song is exactly what you think it is. It's an inspirational song with the most insufferable lyrics ever conceived, with its chorus being ""I'm colorblind!,"" followed by African chants. This is supposed set the tone for an ""important"" scene, and it comes off as anything but. The same with the title song that plays over the credits. The music is just a metaphor for the film as a whole. Too heavy-handed and serious for its own good, when the film is made by a bunch of Americans.

The cast is decent, but only headlined by two stars, and mostly unknowns for the rest. Matt Damon is a blank slate with a distracting accent. But Morgan Freeman highlights the film in a performance that just fits like a glove. Who's the most natural person in Hollywood to play Nelson Mandela? Morgan Freeman. And Freeman does very well in the role, even if the writing is far from top-notch.

Overall, the great Nelson Mandela deserves a lot better than what this movie gives. Its tone is inconsistent and all over the place. It hold very little interest for the viewer. It's ineptly paced and it's just SO BLOODY LONG! Well, it's only 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Sorry Eastwood, I just wasn't feeling this film, and I wasn't really a fan with what you did with it.

3938328,5,B002JCSWVG,"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors.  Which is why I had to watch this movie.  Pretty much anything with him in it is fair game.  And I gotta say, this was a fantastic movie.

Freeman plays Nelson Mandela who has recently been elected President after Apartheid ends in South Africa.  Its a time of turmoil however as for the first time black people are given freedoms they haven't had and it makes those who held power for a long time very nervous. Mandela seeks to calm these fears and bring about peace and understanding.  And he chooses to do it a very unique way; Rugby.

A violent sport to be sure but also very near and dear to South Africans.  Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is the captain of the Springboks, South Africa's rugby team.  The World Cup is coming to South Africa and the Bokkes have not been playing the best.  Mandela meets with Pienaar and lets him know that he has great expectations for the team, and gives him some inspiration as well.  He also mandates that the Springboks start holding practices with some of the poorer children of the country for greater public appreciation of the team. In between this and their harsh training, its a very long chance that they will be able to win the cup.

The characters for the most part in this movie are very believable.  Considering that apartheid was not too long before Mandel meets with these players though, I was amazed that the movie showed them all giving him the greatest respect.  I would have though a few team members might have been less than respectful in reality.

The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack.  Great music and singing and it seemed very true to Africa.  I'm a big fan of World music and the soundtrack did not disappoint in this aspect.

Overall the message was one of triumph and overcoming adversity.  I'm always a big fan of feel-good movies and this one didn't disappoint.  When you find yourself unconsciously smiling through the second half of the movie, you know its good.  I also shed a few tears as well.  Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job with this movie and the love and hard work in it truly shows.",1283558400,,2126,4.524934383202099
3938329,5,B002JCSWVG,"A quietly superb film from Clint Eastwood, Invictus is another genre defying entry, from a director with a long track record of them, that is not quite a sports movie but neither is it a biography of its world famous central character Nelson Mandela.

Anthony Peckham's clever script is nominally about Mandela's support - over fierce objections from his own party - for the hated national Springbok rugby team & how their improbable victory at the 1995 world cup finally overcame the bitter divisions of the apartheid era to unite the country at a point when civil war between blacks & whites looked inevitable.

But what we have here is equally a subtle study in Mandela's brilliant grasp of strategy & leadership (he has his aides test him on the names of the Springboks so that when he meets them for the first time he can greet them like old friends) & his shrewd recognition that unless the black majority can demonstrate forgiveness to a sceptical & suspicious white minority - one that controls the banks, the police & the army - the country is doomed.

Key to this is attracting much needed foreign investment (the eyes of the world are watching anxiously) & when Mandela learns that a billion people will be watching the rugby cup final he instantly grasps the PR significance of this for his country & for the world if the Springboks can win the cup.

Freeman is impressively understated here not only capturing Mandela's physical mannerisms (the hunched shoulders from spending decades in a tiny cell) but also leaving it up to the audience to decide whether his public concern for those he must work with - expressed through a succession of carefully calibrated speeches - is genuine or simply the work of a brilliant tactician shrewdly exploiting his media image as a saint. There are hints, here & there, of Mandela's estrangement from his own family & these touchingly remind us that behind the public image is a man who paid a very high personal price for his actions.

A convincingly beefed up Matt Damon is also excellent as the Springbok Captain Francois Piennar. Francois doesn't pretend to understand the politics of the situation but he can intuit immediately that the situation he's in concerns something far greater than just a sports victory as he tries to convince his sceptical team mates. As per Freeman it's delightfully understated acting & it's a very good demonstration of Damon's versatility.

There's also a satisfying parallel storyline to Mandela's efforts which centres on his bodyguards. These guys are perpetually fearful of an assassination attempt & it's a task not made any easier by Mandela's habit of wanting to leave his entourage to go on impromptu walkabouts in the crowds. His security detail are a mixed team of black & whites who on first meeting view each other with barely disguised hostility. Indeed, on their initial encounter the first question out of the mouth of the black guard is 'Have you come to arrest me?'! In the hands of a lesser director & writer this would have descended into cringe-making backslapping & we're-all-brothers-under-the-skin proclamations, but Eastwood is too good a director to fall for this & the slow recognition that both teams are on the same side simply develops organically, without ever seeming forced.

The climactic rugby scenes are satisfyingly crunchy, clearly filmed (there's a refreshing absence of Paul Greengrass-style shaky-cam shots) & the gist of the game is communicated clearly even if the specifics remain obscure. There's also a jaw-dropping scene involving a 747 Jumbo that is one of those outrageous moments so WTF? that it could only have come from real life (& indeed did actually happen).

The stadium sequences depicting thousands of cheering supporters are pretty staggering & demonstrate just how far crowd software has come since Gladiator's famous arena shot. As impressive as that was I always felt there was something not quite right about it but the CG crowds packing Ellis stadium here are completely convincing, indeed overwhelming at times. Invictus is also, I think, superbly edited & it seemed to go by remarkably quickly for a two hour plus movie.

As for Eastwood, he's a directorial marvel avoiding so many of the pitfalls inherent in this kind of material. There's no sense of self- importance about Invictus. The film is epic & yet intimate, if that makes any sense. It wears its themes lightly, as if aware that the material is so strong it doesn't need amping up. Eastwood's understated, unemphatic approach amusingly drives the lazy, the impatient & the immature viewer up the wall but I find his firm, gentle style so stirring it had me welling up with tears on more than one occasion.

Whether it's Francois telling his stunned family he's been invited to tea with Mandela, an absolutely exquisitely judged sequence on the infamous penal colony of Robben Island, where Francois imagines Mandela reciting Invictus in his tiny cell, a blink & you'll miss it moment as a tough white bodyguard hurriedly puts his sunglasses on to hide the fact that he's tearing up at his team having reached the final, or gently underscoring the reconciliation theme by crosscutting the climactic match with a black kid outside the stadium slowly edging closer to a group of white cops listening to the match on their car radio, Eastwood makes this kind of ambitious filmmaking, so littered with obvious booby traps look so bloody easy.

Granted Invictus is unabashedly feel good but there's nothing wrong with that provided it's as well done as it is here. It's a film that leaves you buzzing & although corny to say it - yep - uplifted. Recommended, but do try & catch it on the biggest screen you can.",1283126400,,5718,4.908902691511387
3938330,4,B002JCSWVG,"This movie focuses on a single episode in the history of South Africa right after the election of Nelson Mandela as President, namely the rise of their rugby team from constant struggles to winning the World Cup.

Let me start by acknowledging some legitimate criticisms of the movie, many of which have been noted by other reviewers: (a) rather limited sociohistorical context is provided, which is an issue for viewers not already fairly familiar with the history of South Africa, (b) the pacing of the plot is uneven, and there are gaps in the story, so there's often a lack of proper buildup and the links between events aren't always clear, and (c) the portrait of Mandela is rather incomplete, especially with regard to why he seems to be such a saintly leader yet has very strained relationships with his family.

Having noted these negatives, I recommend ignoring them, because the main purpose of this movie is to present a story of racial and cultural reconciliation which is powerfully uplifting and inspiring, and the movie fully succeeds in this regard, in no small part because the acting is top-notch across the board.  There were many moments during this movie when I was deeply moved, to the extent of recalling the unexpectedly strong emotions I experienced the evening Barack Obama was elected our own President.  Perhaps there's some irony that this unification of South Africans was achieved by vanquishing a series of external rivals, but I suppose this is innocent enough when accomplished via sports rather than war (isn't that part of the purpose of international sports events like the Olympics?).

Summing up, the positives of this movie vastly outweigh the negatives, so I highly recommend it.",1282694400,,1721,5.003496503496503
3938331,5,B002JCSWVG,"The lessons are clear and further illustrated by the recent win at St Andrews by an Afrikaaner who wished Nelson Mandela a happy birthday on the day of his victory. Mandela reached out to his former opponents in a racially charged atmosphere. He made the first step and had to face opposition from his own African National Congress. And not just to the rugby team but all of the South African whites, even bringing some of the former body guards of Mr. Declerk to guard himself. At the end Mr. Mandela makes a point of thanking some of the Afrikaaners for displaying the new flag of the new nation.
Mr. Obama's first act after election was to meet with Mr. McCain. Then he met with conservative pundits; met with leaders of the Dixiecrat-Republican party. Made a point of inviting them to work on major legislation with him.

3938333,3,B002JCSWVG,"Can a movie be both enjoyable and mired with deficiencies? ""Invictus"" proves the answer is a hearty yes.

On the positive side Matt Damon gives a very restrained performance while Morgan Freeman is convincing and inspirational as Nelson Mandela. The rugby action scenes were breathtaking, as were the natural surroundings/background of the South African scenery. Some of the most powerful moments in the movie came when no one was talking or acting -- when the slums of the outlying townships and confines of Robben Island prison were shown.

That said, the movie is fairly one dimensional. It's a story about a President looking to unify a populace, and the rugby team he uses to achieve that goal. Aside from Damon's Francois Pienaar the viewer gets to know one other player on the team. Mandela's family is mentioned numerous times and is seemingly plays an important role in his decision-making, but there is only one scene where we see that side of him (and it seems like there was no good reason to keep the scene in the movie).

A sense of pacing is also lacking. As the movie opens it's about a year to the World Cup and the Springboks are getting smoked by England in a match. The next thing we know the team is having a couple practices (under a new coach that is never introduced), a coaching clinic in one of the townships and then all of a sudden it's the World Cup championship. Of course it's not feasible to show everything leading up to that final match, but more of the in between would have been nice.

It also would have been nice to see how the general population reacts to the team's quest for the Cup. We see a growing bond between Mandela's security men over the game of rugby, but nothing of what was transpiring among people outside the inner circle of the government and the rugby team itself. The movie is supposed to show how rugby and the Springboks' run in the World Cup helped heal the wounds of apartheid, but that is seldom, if ever, shown.

All said, a very enjoyable movie, but one with its share of flaws.",1282089600,5,2042,4.553133514986376
3938334,5,B002JCSWVG,"One of the best movies of 2009, ""Invictus,"" written by Anthony Peckham and directed by Clint Eastwood, takes us to a fascinating moment in modern history.

It's the mid-1990s; the racist and repressive system known as Apartheid has recently been overturned in South Africa, and former political prisoner Nelson Mandela has just been elected the nation's first black president.  Tensions are running high among the Afrikaners, who fear that the majority blacks will use their new-found power to exact revenge on the white minority.  Many of the blacks, on the other hand, find it difficult and distasteful to work in tandem with a people who had degraded, oppressed and even imprisoned them for so long.

Into this quagmire steps Mr. Mandela, a true believer in the power of redemption and reconciliation to change hearts and influence policy, who hits upon a scheme to unite the two factions through their mutual love of rugby, rallying the nation behind the team known as the Springboks, which, for the blacks, once represented all the things they despised about the Apartheid regime.  Against massive odds of both history and human nature, this amazing man manages to heal old wounds and forge a new nation based on equality and respect for all.

Derived from the novel ""Playing the Enemy"" by John Carlin, ""Invictus"" (the title of a Victorian poem Mandela uses as a guide for his own life) could easily have been just another self-congratulatory exercise in ""do-gooder"" drama - but its heartfelt honesty, its accomplished direction and its world-class acting make it so much more.  Morgan Freeman gives a towering, yet carefully understated, performance as the near-saintly Mandela, a role he was clearly born to play, bringing true conviction to the moral strength, innate compassion and basic decency of a man who suffered so much at the hands of others, yet who refused to allow personal bitterness and a desire for revenge to determine the course his life - or his nation - would take.  Instead, Mandela, at great personal risk to his own popularity, used his experience to build bridges and to set his nation on a path towards healing that would allow it to take its rightful place in a modern, more enlightened world where every man is equal and where citizens work together for a common good.  Indeed, Mandela is probably the greatest argument for the Great Men Theory of history the past half century has had to offer.

And Matt Damon, boasting a flawless South African accent, has probably never been better than he is here, playing Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springboks, who is so impressed with Mandela's continued faith in the human race despite all he's been through that he rallies his own team members (most of them white) to join with the president in playing for the glory of the new South Africa - an effort that led them to winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995.

The beauty of ""Invictus"" is that it doesn't find it necessary to over-dramatize the racial tension or to indulge in ginned-up  melodramatics to get its message across.  The racism here is often of a more subtle kind - a careless word here, a thoughtless put-down there - and the movie does an expert job conveying that fact.

Recently, I wrote that I couldn't imagine seeing a more inspiring and uplifting film than ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.""  Well, now I've just seen one.  It's called ""Invictus"" - and it is not to be missed.",1281225600,,3427,4.822525597269625

Matt Damon does a nice turn as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbooks, who coming like the rest of his teammates from an Afrikaner home hostile to the new regime slowly warms up to Mandela. Morgan Freeman is almost insufferable as the new president, showing him almost as a holy fool, a nave, always smiling, quasi imbecile. The real Mandela, who was (for a good cause) the leader of Africa's main armed faction for more than thirty years, is probably made of sterner stuff.

3938337,4,B002JCSWVG,"This particular dvd rental lay on my sofa table for a long time before deciding to watch it. Although I did not know the story and don't know very much about rugby, I felt as though it would be somewhat predictable. Just another sports film. Wrong.

The backdrop of regime change is well shown as well as being well told. When the new President Mandela chooses his body guards it serves as an illustration of how he wants South Africa to be. Personal conflicts have to be overcome. They are white because they are experienced, they are black because they are good at their job but few in number.

The effects of prolonged imprisonment are also shown. The genius of a man determined to listen and to learn in order to realise his own aims is breathtaking at times. There is nothing like an open mind to undermine those who fail to think.

The character of the glorious rugby captain is very well played, the inspiration not just from innate leadership skills but also the ability to read a game at any given moment came through in Matt Damon's performance. And the parallels with running a country are a fascinating overlap. Invictus is Nelson Mandela's story. His foresight, his inspiration; his will to win. Morgan Freeman's portrayal is convincing.

Clint Eastwood's direction is assured, the game of rugby did not totally depend on thorough knowledge of the rules. Whether the scrums are as non verbal as shown in the film I would doubt somehow. But the idea of winning, of men winning is something to be shared by many. Perhaps this film is not for wallflowers?

Of course such clarity of purpose comes at a cost. And the cost of family affection seems to be borne heavily on the free Mr Mandela. Freedom without responsibility is quickly mutated into greed. And with greed comes isolation. Desperation. Despair.

The poem which seems to have lifted our incarcerated hero is overblown, heightened emotional rhetoric about being the master of your soul and master of your fate. Why do I get the feeling that he understood the English with this poem? Know your enemy.",1280707200,,2069,4.717451523545706

3938340,4,B002JCSWVG,"Somehow, Clint can't quite put a foot wrong lately, and while this movie does not perhaps match his directorial highs, it's a great solid entry and well worth seeing.  But perhaps it's not best served being described as an Eastwood movie - this is Morgan Freeman's film.  This is the role he has been aching to play - Nelson Mandela, and Mandela himself said it was Freeman should play him in any movie depicting him.
This is not the whole life story of Mandela though, it's a snapshot, used to illustrate the character and charisma of the man.  The moment is the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and charts Mandela's conviction that the Rugby was a chance to unite the blacks and whites in a moment of national pride, to finally give truth to his `rainbow nation'.  As such, and given the facts are well known, it's a fairly predictable movie - you know what happens.  What's more, some of the allegories for the bigger picture - the animosity between the white and black bodyguards breaking down as rugby unites them - are a little too trite.  There's a nagging feeling that a bigger more complicated picture is not explored - after all, is South Africa now everything Mandela wanted it to be?
Perhaps it's just unkind to complain about these little niggles.. in much the same way that the rugby purists who say the rugby isn't quite right are missing the point.  This is about Mandela, and his people, and it tells a remarkable story, no matter how simplified and streamlined it is here.  Who could fail but be moved by Matt Damon standing in Mandela's actual cell and start to comprehend what the man went through, and the level of forgiveness he exhibited.
Matt Damon does fine, if not inspiring.  Perhaps an actual South African actor would have been more convincing.. it's hard not to be constantly aware that you're looking at Damon, not a rugby team captain.  His dissimilarity in height and stature to the rugby team captain is well documented, but not that relevant to his impact on screen.  Freeman though is... well, just IS Mandela.  He inhabits the role so naturally that it hardly seems worth mentioning.. like that's just the way it's meant to be.  And the cinematography, particularly in crisp bluray hi-def, is wonderful.  And even those rugby scenes.. for the non-purists among you, they do a good enough job of giving a flavour of being in a match, to make the final game a suitable climax.  As an aside, let's not forget this is a period movie.  And with a clever blend of discreet special effects, clever photography and typically fastidious  art direction, the mid 90's are perfectly evoked.
Politics are explored, Mandela's character is explored, rugby is explored.. it's a lot to cover.  Some elements, such as a deeper understanding of the political context, the solitary black player on the team, or Mandela's home life, are sacrificed as a result of covering so much ground.

3938346,4,B002JCSWVG,"It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.

These words, this verse of the poem by William Ernest Hensley in 1875, was the mantra of Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment in South Africa. He refused to give in to hate. He refused to give in to revenge. But how do you pull along an entire country with you? Especially a country as racially divisive as South Africa where Apartheid was a part of the landscape and politics for nearly 50 years?

Risking everything, Mandela achieved greatness by focusing not on politics, but on a sport: Rugby. Wanting to win the World Cup and thus unite a country, Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanted/dp/B001GKJ2FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanted</a>) sets out not to divide and conquer, but to unite and calm the racial tensions raging through his beloved South Africa.

With him, Mandela must convince Rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M5AJQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>) that their poorly performing team can do the impossible: win the World Cup.

As most of us now know, that is precisely what happens, and South Africa, for a while, forgets her bloody black-and-white past and turns everyone flush with excitement for simply being South African.

Clint Eastwood has proven in his waning years that he should remain (mostly) behind the camera and not in front of it. With the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gran-Torino/dp/B001KVZ6ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gran Torino</a>, I've not been much of a fan of his as of late. However, when it comes to his directing chops, I've been fairly well pleased. Probably my favorite acted/directed Clint film would be the lesser known&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heartbreak-Ridge/dp/B003ASLJOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heartbreak Ridge</a>. But that might just be me.

Many have already said that this was ""the role Morgan Freeman was meant to play,"" and I won't contradict that. He was completely believable as Mandela, getting the look, verbal cadence and movements of The Great Man down perfectly.

Matt Damon on the other hand ...didn't really strike me as the bullish and larger-than-life Francois. Although I think he did ""okay."" I believe that a search for a more stylized actor could've easily resulted in a match more adequate to the part.

Regardless, the filming is enthralling because of Freeman's performance and the fact-based situations that this movie is based upon.

3938349,3,B002JCSWVG,"Clint Eastwood's latest film may be set against the backdrop of a post apartheid South Africa, but above all else it is a testament to the power of sports to bring people together and provide something to believe in.  In tis sense, it is one of the director's simplest works to date.  But that doesn't mean that it isn't a stirring film that offers much to think about.

Invictus follows Nelson Mandella after his election as South Africa's president at the end of apartheid and his struggle to unite his country.  He finds his opportunity with the nation's rugy team; a group of mostly white players that have been exhibiting poor play and are on the verge of being disbanded by the nation's non-white majority who view them as a reminder of the oppression that they endured for nearly 50 years.  Mandella speaks up for the maligned group suggesting that keeping them intact would serve as a gesture of peace and forgiveness to the country's white minority who have lost their power and may fear reprisal.

Mandella also reaches out to the captain of the rugby team (a beefed up Matt Damon) and encourages him to inspire his teammates to be more than they think are capable of.  Without saying so, he asks the team to win the 1995 world cup.  His hope is that his racially divided nation will come together to support a team that represents them all, not just the white minority.

And so the movie follows the team as they undertake their overwhelming task of winning the world cup. They also take on the role of ambassadors to the angry and povery stricken citizens by traveling to the slums and teaching the game to children.  Since the story that the movie is based on is true, there is no need to bring cheap sentiment or melodramatic sub plots into the picutre.  Eastwood simply lets the story tell itself with predictable yet uplifting results.

The performances are strong everywhere.  Morgan Freeman is the epitome of grace under pressure as Mandella and Matt Damon nicely captures the mixed emotions of a man who is put in the difficult position of inspiring his teammantes  and serving as a bridge between the nation's racial divide.  It is naive, of course, to believe that the team's improbable run and victory solved the nation's problems, or that Mandella was as infalible and saintly as he is portrayed here.  But it is easy to believe that for a brief time, a nation stood together and supported their rag-tag rugby team as they made everyone forget about the ever present problems that were continuing to rip them apart.  That is the ultimate power of sports; to provide something to believe in, even if for a brief period of time.  That is ultimately what Invictus accomplishes.",1279152000,6,2697,4.690021231422505

The movie could not do justice to the excellent book by John Carlin and the movie doesn't try, read the book iif you want to read about the actual events that led to Mandela's release and his decision to use the Rugby World Cup to unify his country.",1278201600,2,664,4.2362204724409445
3938356,4,B002JCSWVG,"As we are currently in the midst of the football (soccer) world cup (also taking place in South Africa), this film is no doubt timely. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's attempt to unite his country just after the end of apartheid and at the beginning of his presidency. He sees an opportunity to use sports to rally his country behind one common goal: rugby. He recruits the captain of South Africa's rugby team to not only win the world cup competition but unite the color schism  within the country.

I really enjoyed this film however, the characters/story were not as developed as one might have hoped. The story eludes to family troubles for Mandela but does not really develop it. He is seen having an argument with his daughter and is shown to become agitated when asked about his family. As this is a true story, there may not have been a resolution to his family troubles but it left me wondering why Eastwood even bothered including it in the film. The references to it were so cursory that it would seem as though the film would have been fine without it. Likewise, the black population's shift to supporting the South African rugby team seemed too easy-- formerly, blacks would root against them. A black local government even voted to change the name and colors of the team until Mandela stopped them.  It just seemed as though approval of the rugby team seemed to shift over night without any justifiable reason for occurring or at least viewable softening towards them.

The two main actors do a wonderful job in their roles. Damon, who usually comes off as very intelligent in interviews, was able to seem simple yet noble in this role and Freeman, who is no stranger to playing a Black South African (the power of one), gracefully conveys the strength of a man who can forgive despite the immense cruelty.

This film is definitely worth watching. It's an uplifting feel good movie.",1278201600,2,1900,4.659701492537313
3938357,5,B002JCSWVG,"Leaving the movie description to other more able reviewers, I won't repeat anything.  Let me just say I am seeing it for about the fifth or sixth time and my eyes still well with tears of emotion when I see that troubled nation magically changing by the sheer will of the great statesman Nelson Mandela. He managed to draw all peoples together and change the flag and the nation to multi-color, and he managed to win the Springboks over before they won the 1995 World Cup. If I could be granted a wish to have been anywhere in the past 20 years, it would be attending that great game in Ellis Stadium in Johannesburg, the last bastion of Afrikanerdom, just to watch that game, the mighty Springboks versus the feared New Zealand All-Blacks (so named after the color of their uniforms). I'd see the old Boer ""bitter-ender"" descendants of hard-line Afrikaner voortrekkers playing rugby and fathers and sons of apartheid hugging and being hugged by peoples of all colors and persuasions during and after the game when their countrymen won the World Cup. I'd hear people of all tribes, colors, and religions cheering and shouting Mandela's name and see that game. I'd hear alack, white, and every color of men, women, and children sing ""Nkosi Sikelele' iAfrica"", the cherished song of black freedom. The film is true to life by director Clint Eastwood. But oh to be in old J'burg just to see the Springboks win the World Cup Rugby and the great president Mandela in his Springbok jersey and cap, smiling from ear to ear, as he presented the World Cup to the Captain of the Springboks, which by his sheer force of will he made the whole country's team, no longer exclusive to Afrikaners.

Immediately after seeing this movie I googled Francois Pienaar and got him on You-Tube talking to and about Mandela and ended up buying the book ""Playing the Enemy"", by John Carlin, which moved me even more. It reassured me of the authenticity of the film. The 'Boks winning that day was the crowning moment for South Africa not just in sporting events but the culmination and beginning of Mandela's ""One Team, One Country"" idea which both shocked, surprised, and pleased all citizens (mostly themselves) by their own reactions.

President Nelson Mandela is played most ably by Morgan Freeman,and in voice, accent, and and gesture--he is  authentically Mandela). Francois Pienaar, the Afrikaans Captain of the Springboks is played by Matt Damon (of Bourne fame) with a very authentic Afrikaans accent and a fierce rugby-playing skill, though only 5'11"" not 6'4"" is very believable and played a strong Captain. He was big in soul and a convincing Captain and you could see Damon was playing great rugby. I'am sure the real Pienaar was pleased. The first meeting between Pienaar and Mandela, like everything in the film, is based on fact. I had no inkling that these incidents had ever occurred. How I managed to miss this is beyond someone who has been following South African politics and reading all she could since the mid-sixties. But this film is about more than a game, it is the magic of Mandela and his shrewd and wise perception that sports can be a uniting force, and he played it for all it was worth, and the beginning of a great, united South Africa came to be, and at a very pivotal point in South Africa's history.

Of course there is much more than the Springboks game involved in this film. As in real life, there was more to Mandela's presidency ending apartheid, and his most herculean task was to draw all peoples together in a spirit of forgiveness, redemption, and the Afrikaner Springboks represented all Afrikaners in this effort, and that was key in succeeding.  Mandela believes that sometimes in order to create a new nation people have to work with people they don't like, or even trust!

In the film, Mandela gives a poem to the Springbok Captain. ""Invictus"", the famous poem by William Ernest Henley and though it's not mentioned in Mandela's own autobiography or even in the book ""Playing the Enemy,"" Eastwood takes a liberty by making it Mandela's comfort and strength while in prison. It may well have been so, as it is for anyone who lives under such horrible conditions.

Please, please, if you like the film, buy the book on Amazon, as well. It is even better to read and savor.  I will be reviewing the book as well.",1278115200,5,4336,4.724867724867725

3938361,5,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus is a movie that presents two interwoven themes: The beginnings of the reign of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, and the story of the rugby World Cup of 1995.  The pace is rapid and the tone tense, as Mandela has inherited a country burning with racial tension and on the edge of civil war.

Nelson Mandela, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, begins his attack on his nation's problems his first day.  His message is clear.  South Africa is one nation, one people, who must work together for the good of the country.  As Mandela arrived for his first day, the government employees of the previous administration were packing to leave.  Mandela asked them to stay and help the country heal.  This set the tone of his plan.

Meanwhile, the Springboks, the South African national Rugby team was adrift, not knowing their fate.  Mandela sought out the team captain Francois Pienaar, (superbly  played by Matt Damon) to ask his help building a first rate world cup team.  A surprised Pienaar agrees.

Mandela's focus upon the national rugby team projects a message of reconciliation for the nation of South Africa.  Mandela asks his people to follow that model.  Mandela sets the example by learning the names and backgrounds of every member of the rugby team.  He visits some practices, tells the team that the entire nation supports them, then approaches each man, calls him by name and thanks him for his help.

The title of the film ""Invictus"" is taken from a poem by William Ernest Henley.  The lines of the poem inspired Nelson Mandela when he was in prison for 27 years.  Several of the verses relate to the film.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

""Invictus"" is an excellent movie that is well directed and well acted.  It presents world events that most Americans never witness.  I highly recommend this film.",1277596800,3,2078,4.679558011049724
3938362,5,B002JCSWVG,"It's 1995 and Nelson Mandela (Freeman) has just been elected the first democratically elected black president of South Africa.  Not surprisingly, his supporters see this as the ultimate opportunity for pay back to the white community for all the years of oppression.  But Mandela is a different kind of leader.  He believes in working hard to unite all the people and forgiving those who have harmed him and his people. Everyone assumes Mandela will replace the white leadership of the struggling national rugby team with his own.  However, Mandela sees this as an opportunity to unify the country through sports.  He commits himself to working with the existing white leadership and particularly the captain of the rugby team played by Matt Damon. He challenges Damon to rise to the occasion and capture the World Cup which they are hosting. He is taking a great risk with the future of his leadership.  Based on the true story of Nelson Mandela and South Africa, it is part history, part leadership lesson and a moving sports drama.  Highly recommend.",1277510400,,1053,4.948863636363637

If you are in a leadership position, or wish to be, this movie can teach you a lot. Nelson Mandela, after 30 years in prison, leads with class, dignity, compassion, intelligence, fairness, and vision. Watch Mandela then compare him to our recent political leaders in the U.S. with the backstabbing, partisan politics that gets us nowhere. If you want to be in management, coaching, or any position of leadership, watch and learn from this film.",1277510400,,550,4.8
3938364,4,B002JCSWVG,"In one sense, this movie adheres to all the well-established rules of the inspirational sports movie. An underdog team is inspired by a wise leader and overcomes the odds to win the championship. But the performance of Mrgan Freeman, who embodies the noble character of Nelson Mandela, elevates this film to a higher level.

Mandela is of course the outstanding moral leader of our times. Freeman brings him vibrantly to life. None of the other characters, including Matt Damon as the captain of the South African rugby team, achieves much depth. This movie is all about Freeman and Mandela.

Released from 27 years in prison, Mandela is elected the first president of the post apartheid South Africa -- but his nation is badly riven by hatred and inequality. He must find ways of getting beyond the past and moving forward. (Pity he was succeeded by Mbeki, a moral pygmy compared to Mandela, who denied the existence of HIV and did immense damage to his country.)

Rugby is the game of the white minority while the black majority plays soccer and despises rugby as the game of the oppressor. South Africa is hosting the World Cup of rugby in 1995 with a team that is all white with the exception of one black player. But Mandela sees the tournament as an opportunity to rally the entire nation behind the team and finds an ally is Francois Pienaar, the captain who has a surprisingly open mind.

There are some subplots, not very much developed. Mandela has to integrate his staff, including his security detail, which means finding a way for blacks and their former oppressors to work together.

Another false note is the sappy song, ""Colorblind"" inserted midway through the movie.

When we get to the actual games, the movie reverts to type. We hear a lot of grunting and thudding collisions of large men. The action seems slow and plodding compared to an actual rugby match.

The movie's title comes from a Victorian poem which Freeman mumbles, sotto voce. I wish we could have heard it properly. Also, I wish the DVD had included some extras that could have included interviews with the real-life Pienaar and background about the events depicted in the movie. But there were no extras at all.

Having said that, this is a rousing and enjoyable movie. Sport can be incredibly powerful in inspiring a nation -- but the inspiration and good feelings created by victories on the sport field tend not to be very longlasting. After the party is over, the real problems remain.",1277510400,2,2475,4.766355140186916

I have been to Mandella's cell on Robbin Island, and all I can say is that this Mandella is more saintly than any character in the Bible.

An example of this persecution is with the fairy tale about the first heart transplant donar being a native man(who has the right blood type) and his wife, were found on the beach both dead and not having any other family. That is impossible, this is a tribal society you always have relatives.

3938368,4,B002JCSWVG,"From my wife Sarah: I'm really glad I saw this movie. I learned so much, and was just simply amazed (not even a strong enough word) and blown away with the man, Nelson Mandela. This movie showed beautifully what he was up against trying to bring together a torn country full of hate and bitterness. It looked impossible, but he never lost heart.

What was so magnificently shown was the incredible forgiveness that Mandela gave. The movie showed him as a true leader and role model for everyone. It effectively showed what he suffered and lost, and how he was willing to fight if absolutely necessary. But it also showed how he looked for a way through peace whenever it was possible (and when it looked impossible to others). He did all this despite what people thought of him. Even his own family. His amazing ability as a visionary, diplomat and peacemaker was shown so well. I was so blown away by this man that I couldn't stop thinking about it. I ended up doing some research on him to learn more.

I gave the movie 4 stars because there are long segments that were quite dull. When the soccer games were shown, they were difficult to follow, and very dull. Even my husband who is a huge sports fan couldn't follow and got really bored. Since these scenes take up a significant portion of the film I felt I needed to take that into account in my rating.

Regardless, this movie is a real eye opener, and so valuable. It's so worth seeing for everyone.",1277424000,,1457,4.469924812030075

But lucky for me, Clint Eastwood has given me a front row seat to the game as well as the locker room antics of this merry group of beer swigging rapscallions.  And there is a very important political message of people working together despite deep hatreds.  Please take note.

3938372,5,B002JCSWVG,"The perfect choice for the charismatic and spiritually powerful Nelson Mandela was Morgan Freeman. Mandela has recently been freed from a hellish prison term of over 30 years and has won the popular vote for South Africa's presidency. Not everyone feels comfortable with this and the tension in the country is at its worst. Pondering the country's morale and hundreds of administrative matters, Mandela seizes a far fetched opportunity, but must enlist help. Matt Damon gives a hell of a performance as the captain of a soccer (football) team in South Africa, the Springboks, secretly tasked with the impossible dream of winning the World Cup! If that is not enough, he senses that failure would mean a lost opportunity for bringing a shattered nation together again.

Freeman is indescribably incandescent in Mandela's humanity, the silent musings over problems, the undying strength and grace. The viewer can almost see mind gears churning toward resolution, as Freeman's emotions are palpable onscreen. Freeman's kinetics undeniably show compassion and caring for his people, black or white, rich or poor, gender and faith neutral...the kind of unconditional love that only sainted beings are historically ascribed. Please move over, Mother Teresa and Ghandhi...make room on the bench... for Mandela belongs in the highest altitude and this movie took him there! Thank you, Clint Eastwood (a director with the touch of light) for making this movie!

Although the movie is about politics, freedom, love for our fellow man...it transcends every expectation. It is incendiary with historical accuracy...the movie presents an evocational powerhouse of drama, action, adrenaline rushes, and unabashed tears of pride and joy.

3938373,4,B002JCSWVG,"If don't know rugby, a touchdown is called a try. This movie about the great World Cup rugby game at the beginning of Mandela's Presidency definitely scores. It takes place when South Africa's shaky new multiracial democracy was still finding its feet after years of white rule. Mandela needed to make peace and heal the land. He saw an opportunity to create rapprochement and a national bonding experience by embracing the game beloved by his former enemy and despised by his supporters.

However, there are also some fumbles - the other meaning if you will - of ""try"".

Without doubt, Morgan Freeman gives an Oscar-worthy reincarnation of Mandela - thus putting himself firmly in the King-Poitier-Ali-Crosby-Oprah-Obama pantheon of black-people who radically changed white perceptions. Matt Damon too, gives a great aw-shucks performance as an innocent racist who understands how much he has to change. You'll barely recognize this bulked up version of Damon and his South African accent is flawless. But, for the most part they are stock characters - you don't really know what makes Mandela tick and you can't fully grasp the transformation of Pienaar (Damon), the rugby captain, because you just don't know that much about him.

While the movie works well at the storytelling level, it also rings somewhat hollow. You see this momentous change in a terrible political situation through old newscasts but not through the cast. The black presidential security detail has to make peace with white special service cops who may once have jailed them. The white cops are now reporting to people who may once have tried to blow them up. But you see none of this in personal backstories. The pacing is slow but it is steady and it builds. The end may be predictable but the audience still applauded. If you have no idea what rugby is you will leave the theater unenlightened and those of us who know about rugby can see the ball was somehow dropped.

Therein lies the problem: this is a movie about symbols, the kind that can bring everyone together, make peace and bind a nation. If you can't really explain the true nature of rugby, you can't really explain its significance in this story. As for the title: what is a nice Latin word like Invictus doing in an African movie? Shouldn't Mandela - just one generation away from living in a hut with a polygamous family - be reaching back to an African poem for inspiration? Wouldn't you expect something more African than classical?

In a way, it echoes the story of the kouros statue the Getty Museum once acquired. Scientists analyzed the stone and lawyers certified the paper trail. But when Thomas Hoving of the Met took one look at it, he knew it was fake because it looked ""fresh"" - something you don't expect in a 3,000 year old statue. In fact, it was a modern reproduction made from authentic stone from that period.

That is not to say this movie is a fake but it is obviously made - well made, mind you - by people of a different age, place and time who have fused the authentic with something that isn't quite right. The author is a British journalist who covered South Africa, the screenwriter is a non-rugby loving ex-patriate South African living in Morro Bay, California. The supporting actors and Damon's voice coach are all authentic South Africans but the director and the two lead actors are American. As good a job as they did technically, something got lost in the mix. Instead of being too lively, this movie is, if anything, muted - even somber. You'd have to wonder what it would look like if a South African director had made it. What if, say, Gavin Wood (Tsotsi) or an up-and-coming African director had done it, how different would it would be?

First, you would get a visceral sense of the times. People were very scared, very divided but also hopeful. The townships were bursting with exuberance. The whites experienced fear, loathing but also optimism. You see it in Invictus but you really don't feel it. The celebration of the blacks matched the viciousness of the old white regime while the crime spree justified their old fears. Houses once designed to be open - even admired - became surrounded with walls, then barbed wire, power gates and finally, electrified fences. Yet the whites felt somehow liberated too and to understand that you'd have to see how war and rebellion-weary they had become. You never quite feel the two different cultures - an African world drenched in music, dance and excitement versus a stiff, though cordial white world where the music is at best, restrained.

Most of all though, you would understand why rugby really matters. It is not just that the white Afrikaners were the country's exclusive payers of rugby, it is that it's a territorial game. Rugby is played around the scrum, that beehive formation of men from each team pushing against each other in contention for a ball thrust in its midst at the beginning of each play. Whichever team plucks it out - usually by foot - gets to run with the ball. The traditional advantage of the South African team is that they are one of the heaviest in the game. That is why Damon filled up on pap `n wors for the role.  The heavier the scrum the better the chance they have of pushing the other team out of the way and grabbing the ball.

The point about rugby in South Africa is not just that it is the game of the oppressors but a kind of reenactment of the way they pushed the indigenous people off the land to get at its resources. That explains why the formerly great Bokke had lost their mojo. Thanks to majority rule, they were being pushed off their land and they just couldn't pull off their old act on the rugby field any more. At least, not until they had gotten permission, marching orders and reassurance from the new black president.

The poem, Invictus, is never fully fleshed out and in truth it was an obscure 19th century poem written by a 12 year old who'd lost his leg to TB. While understandably awkward as a poem it ends with these two resounding lines:

""I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.""

 In fact, Mandela never sent that poem to Pienaar. He had been inspired by it in jail but he actually sent the rugby captain a version of Roosevelt's ""Man in the Arena"" speech to inspire him.

Regardless of the actual poem, what matters is that Mandela reached out to a third place - a non-African heritage - to bring these former warring Africans of different races together. How do you explain that to Americans? They see these great aerial shots of Cape Town, the sophisticated cities contrasted with the black shantytowns (although you never go into any of these ""informal"" houses) and they must wonder: What Africa is this?

That is not say this isn't a very good movie. It is not ""Biko"", ""Gandhi"" or even ""Chariots of Fire"" though it is at least at the very front of the second tier. There is an academy award nomination or two in this and Clint deserves kudos for taking on something so far afield from his usual fare: Dirty Harry reincarnated as a couple of near-saints. As a feel-good movie it does indeed score: almost everyone wins - the whites, the blacks (he did forget the Jewish guy, Joel Stransky, a kind of South African Sandy Koufax who actually won the game with the drop kick.) The New Zealanders - ironically called the ""All Blacks"" on account of their uniforms - get to be the losers here even though they were a much more racially integrated team.

Not only that, but the All Blacks began each game with a fearsome Maori wardance called a Hakka which seemed to be lead by the blondest player. All the Bokke could do was glare back. But any South African knows they have their own ceremonial weapon, which is just as formidable: the Zulu War Dance. Yet no one mentions it - perhaps because Afrikaner rugby players don't dance like that - ever - and Mandela was Xhosa as were most of the ruling ANC party and they were feuding with the Zulus. The New Zealanders even had rugby's first true superstar, Jonah Loma, a terrifying figure who could simply plough through the opposing team with legs as thick and as unstoppable as tree trunks rolling down a cliff.

Nevertheless, Mandela's support, Afrikaner determination and a little Hebrew footwork won the day and put the country on the track toward unity. In the end, this movie wins the cup but you get the idea there is more to be drunk from it along with a few more visits to the well.

STARRING: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Tony Kgoroge, Marguerite Wheatley, Patrick Mofokeng, Matt Stern, Julian Lewis Jones, Adjoa Andoh and Scott Eastwood

WRITTEN BY: Anthony Peckham; based on the book by John Carlin

DIRECTED BY: Clint Eastwood

Rated: PG - 13

There is something about African music that soothes my soul. It's so spiritual and overwhelmingly beautiful. Director Clint Eastwood's latest film Invictus embodies not only this amazing music, but other similar elements that will move you in indifferent manners.

Morgan Freeman finds himself nominated for yet another Academy Award, for his flawless portrayal of the real life president of South Africa (and much more), Nelson Mandela. While I was glad to see Jeff Bridges finally take home his Oscar, Freeman was definitely a competing factor.

The film essentially serves as two great film genres in one: the bio-pic, and the sports movie. It excels at both feats.

After serving nearly three decades of his life sentence in prison for supposed `sabotage', Nelson Mandela is released and elected president of the very country that barred him from his freedoms. You wouldn't guess that Mandela was aware of this however, as he holds no grudge and wants nothing more than to give back to his country. The fact that this all actually happened, only makes us appreciate the film that much more.

This is the early 90s, and although the apartheid has come to an end, racism's ugly head is still looming about. Mandela is desperate to evoke a change for his people. He finds comfort in learning that the world cup of Rugby, which only comes around every four years, is due its turn in history and South Africa has a slight chance of advancing forward with a shot at the main event. It's a very small chance, but Mandela seizes the moment in an effort to use this as an opportunity to unite his country.

He befriends the captain of the team known as the Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). Being raised by ingnorant parents, Francois sees something in President Mandela that births the inspiration for a change in his life. Francoios further finds courage and faith in his team through Mandela, and fights with all he has to lead them to the world cup. With the odds stacked astronomically high against them, the Springboks will need the support of each other and their nation, to succeed.

Invictus wasn't quite as good as some of Eastwood's other works, but when virtually every picture he directs are among the best ever made, it's not at all a discredit to him or the film.

The list of ""redeeming"" movies would include He Got Game, Hoosiers, and The Natural.

Directed by Clint Eastwood, this movie is based on the real-life journey of South Africa's rugby team to the championship post-apartheid.

Morgan Freeman does a wonderful job playing Nelson Mandela; his portrayal of the Nobel-prize winner is probably the most accurate rendition I've seen of a world leader by a Hollywood actor.

Mr Eastwood surrounds himself with worthy backup; he has tirelessly absorbed more education on filming, composing, directing, and acting than possibly anyone else working today; and he has an eye for a story. His most recent work, ""Invictus"", is proof positive.

It is a history lesson that is watchable, human, and brave. Nelson Mandela came out of years of incarceration in a tiny cell to lead his country with a measure of strength and forgiveness that is reminiscent of Gandhi. That he emerged from such a trial without bitterness and with such wisdom is a miracle.

Upon his winning presidency of South Africa, Mandela - played with absolute conviction by the great Morgan Freeman - becomes convinced that the way to bring the wounded, racially divided country together is to make the national rugby team shine. The Springboks are sort of the Detroit Lions of rugby, with the diffrence being they are the ONLY team in the country. And at the time of the story, they are perennially in the cellar of the rugby world.

Mandela's eye is caught by the forthright leader of the Springboks, played by Matt Damon, who does his usual excellent acting as well as a pretty good go at a South African accent. Between the two of them, Mandela and Francois encourage the beaten team to greater and greater heights, until they enter the World Cup as worthy frontrunners.

Set against the turbulent time period as South Africa moved away from apartheid, it is a film powerful in scope, restrained in portrayal, and not without a few red herrings thrown in to keep the viewer just a little off-balance.

I thought Freeman was an excellent Mandela, and Damon is quite convincing as well, but Eastwood lets this one linger on a bit too long, and the climactic rugby match becomes almost ridiculous as it plays out slower and slower in slow motion that sure does slow everything down, and quickly. It's all a little too manipulative by the end, which is a shame as that detracts from some very fine acting and a good script.

But Invictus is still a pleasure to watch and is a very well-made film, all in all. It shows a magic moment in the very troubled history of this land, and the heart of Mandela's message of peace and tolerance and turning the other cheek comes across quite powerfully. That's the real soul of this film, not the rugby, and the final scene distracts from that as Invictus becomes a somewhat cheesy sports flick for its last thirty minutes. But the previous ninety are quite excellent at points, and it's a film worth watching for various reasons, most of all to ponder the magnificence of Mandela's character, as a deeply extraordinary man and a Christian in the true sense of the term.",1274659200,3,1114,4.565

3938390,4,B002JCSWVG,"What a powerful story, a remarkable leader, and incredible direction here.  Invictus is the true story of Nelson Mandela and the '95 Rugby World Cup.

Eastwood easily could have pulled on the emotional strings and presented the harsh realities of the apartheid in South Africa.  He also could have appealed to any impatient movie watchers by inserting graphic details of the grueling years of captivity Mandela endured.  But instead this story begins immediately after he was released from prison and is elected president.  He has the daunting task of rebuilding the country after the fall of apartheid.  Could sports really help a country unite?

The acting here is impeccable.  Morgan Freeman has turned in tons of great performances, but never has he felt more perfect for a role.  Plus Matt Damon did great with his accent and mannerisms of the team captain.

I was very impressed with the actions and words of Nelson Mandela.  He reminded me of Mahatma Gandhi.  Despite his lengthy imprisonment and his country's animosity that lingered from the past, he refused to act out of hatred.

""THIS IS NO TIME FOR PETTY REVENGE""

3938391,3,B002JCSWVG,"Clint Eastwood seems absent from this little movie until the credits at the end.  What could have been a powerful little drama ends up being a volley between a hero president of South Africa and a Rugby Field.  Granted we know a lot about the extraordinary Nelson Mandela and his surviving imprisonment to be released and form a government that through his inspiration brought an end to Apartheid.  This little story about how he focused on encouraging a Rugby team's determination and success in winning the 1995 World Cup for Rugby and for bringing together a splintered country into a unified whole is well worth knowing, but little else happens here - we discover no insights into Nelson Mandela's character or that of his chosen inspirer Franois Pienaar. Clint Eastwood is usually far more sensitive and dramatic.

The name of the movie is taken from the 1875 poem that inspired Mandela during his years of imprisonment.  And it seems appropriate to quote that full poem here:
INVICTUS

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

William Ernest Henley

Henley may not have become a poet known for anything else but this poem, but he will always be quoted when it comes to stories such as this one.  The superb actor Morgan Freeman endures denture and facial make up and a shaky new accent as Nelson Mandela, but this is a flat performance - OK, but not memorable.  Matt Damon obviously buffed up for his role and learned  a new accent as Franois Pienaar and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive.  The entire cast is adequate for the little they contribute.  Yes, we want to love this movie and the ending does make us swell with admiration, but it is the getting there that seems an overwrought and excessive 93 minutes!  Worth seeing if only to applaud once again the achievements of Nelson Mandela. Grady Harp, May 10",1274227200,,2367,4.584323040380047
3938392,1,B002JCSWVG,"I think Eastwood here lacks all of his directorial skill and puts out a simple-minded preachy film.

The acting shows that Freeman can do a decent accent, but that's about it.  I am not a fan of Matt Damon, so my views on his performance would be biased.  I'll simply say he is as boring here as he is in any of his films.  He truly is the vanilla in Hollywood's spice rack.

It would be difficule to not be preachy in the telling of this story due to the nature of it.  But there isn't one subtle bit of acting, direction, or writing that doesn't seem to be annointing Mandela for sainthood or Damon as being the ""Great White Hope"" of a new South Africa.

Of course you would never see the decline that has happened in South Africa in the last couple of decades.  That would be against every bit of Political Correctness that Hollywood uses as one of its religions.

But the greatest problem with this film, is that it's boring.

Unless you are going in, with the need to feel good, in that self righteous, ""gosh darn, that was a swell movie that speaks about the promise of diversity...yada yada yada""  then skip it.  Watch instead Stallone's soccer opus where his fellow inmates play against Nazis.

Now I understand why. This man is great, not only for his being jailed for 20+ years against apartheid, but for his character, like a saint, that he not only forgives his enemies for the benefits of his country, but with great wisdom, he unites them. Many reviewers express their frustration when they view it as a sports movie or compare it with the director's previous work. Luckily enough somebody had told me that this is a movie about Mandela and so I could watch it as what it intended to be. Inspirational and motivational! Yet quite entertaining. In short, highly recommended!

Remarks:

1. This is the first Clint Eastwoord directed movie I ever saw. Nevertheless, I am sure he is a great director in that he had not made any violent scene at all yet I can still feel the stress of a post apartheid South Africa.

3938394,4,B002JCSWVG,"INVICTUS is one of those inspiring sports dramas that can very easily make you gag.  The fact that this film does NOT trigger your gag reflex (at least, not until close to the end) is a testament to Eastwood's poignant direction, and the rock-solid performances of the film's two leads.

The film chronicles Nelson Mandela's plight to unite the blacks and whites of post-apartheid South Africa.  His weapon of choice?  Rugby.  Mandela decides to take one of the nation's most hated teams (its colors have often been associated with racism), and rally support for his newly-freed country.  His (somewhat unknowing) conspirator in the scheme is Francois Pienaar, star player for the Springboks.

Freeman shines at Mandela, and Damon gives an understated performance as Pienaar.  They help anchor the script, penned by SHERLOCK HOLMES-scribe Anthony Peckham.  The script seems to want to take a journey deep into the heart of sentimentality, but Eastwood restrains himself.  He makes full use of the soaring music we've come to expect in these films, and the dramatic shots; this is far from Eastwood's best direction, as he seems to give in to genre expectations, instead of defy them (as he did so boldly in UNFORGIVEN).  Yet, he never caves completely, and the film comes off without that sentimental aftertaste this genre usually leaves behind.  The film itself is beautifully shot, with some engaging rugby scenes.  Indeed, Freeman and Damon may have gotten the Oscar-nods (deservedly so), but the game itself is the star of the film, at times even overshadowing the politics.  Which lends the film to some bitter scrutiny, of course; but INVICTUS is so well-made and put together, you really have a hard time criticizing it as a movie.  It's best to view it as a sports film, one which happens to have some political implications; and indeed, it stands as one of the better entries in that genre.",1273968000,,1899,4.965189873417722

3938396,4,B002JCSWVG,"Invictus is a movie set in South Africa just after Nelson Mandala is elected president. Faced with the potential of a civil war, Mandela is looking for ways to unite a South Africa torn apart by apartheid.  Mandela zeroes in on the nation's rugby team - the springboks. The springboks are a team that every black in South Africa, including Mandela himself, would root against hoping the other team, no matter who they were, would win. Now the new president gets behind the team hoping the team can win the rugby world cup and help to unite the country with a common cause.

Invictus is well cast and well acted, although you can hear Morgan Freeman's accent slip every now and then. Matt Damon's accent is impeccable. The tension between the blacks and white was, at times, so thick you could cut it with a knife. The white people are expecting to lose everything when the new regime takes over the country. Time and time again, Mandela shows both sides what true forgiveness is.

One of my few criticisms of Invictus is the slums.  The movie does get the appropriate reaction from the audience when they show the slums, the shanty-type buildings built from bits and pieces of scrap metal and wood.  However, the slums were too clean.  Normally, you'll see used tires on the roofs holding them down against the wind and garbage all over the place.  The slums in Invictus were simply too clean to be real slums.

My other problem is with a scene in which a jetliner buzzes the stadium where the rugby world cup is being held.  The build-up to this scene is as if something ominous is going to happen. A jetliner really did buzz the stadium just before the 1995 rugby world cup. At that time, pre-9/11, this would have been seen as a harmless, even patriotic, stunt.  Post 9/11, this is viewed as a potential terror attack.  The movie plays this up as an impending threat, which did add to the tension of the movie, but it should have been played up as a harmless stunt.

Overall, this is an excellent movie showing the genius of Nelson Mandela's forgiveness of people and his ability to unite a country.",1272240000,3,2102,4.5611702127659575

Clint Eastwood, instead of making a drama movie like his last two films, decided to make what I call a real-life film.

3938399,5,B002JCSWVG,"I am eagerly awaiting the release of Invictus on BluRay.  I saw this in theatres when it came out, and I left the theatre as did most people with I think a look and a sense of complete wonderment on my face.  I often feel jaded when seeing films nowadays (for no reason other than this world can make you see films through a prism of cynicism), but Invictus is one of those rare gems that manages to be both a brilliant sports film, and a brilliant political film about the psyche and power of sport, and its ablility to unite, in every sense of the word, and even under the most fractured conditions where incredible distrust and animosity from years of apartheid and other injustices reign.

The film sports some incredibly accurate and authentic rugby scenes (I am a fairly new supporter of the sport beginning from the 2003 World Cup- I would also recommend ""Forever Strong"" for some of you rugby fanatics), accurately demonstrating the pulverizingly brutal, but ultimately gentlemanly nature of the warriors who play this incredible sport.  More importantly, and what I always believe makes a sports movie rise above the rest is the story of the people in it. This movie is equal parts Francois Pienaar (M. Damon), and Nelson Mandela (M. Freeman).  The genius of Mandela was in sensing the incredible power that Sport had over the previously ruling White Class, and in selling his political plan for unification of South Africa by bringing about reconciliation between whites and blacks.  Mandela does this by convincing Francois Pienaar (captain of SA national Rugby team) and by extension, the Other SpringBoks (nickname for South African Rugby squad) that a victory in the 1995 Worldcup would unify South Africa, even though skepticis abounded at at every turn.

Mandela exhibited political genius by being able to credibly assert to his supporters (who wanted all symbols associated with Springboks eliminated from national discourse) that if he, who had suffered worse than most under apartheid could forgive (and his suffering is given some treatment in the movie in a trip by the Springboks to Robben Island where Mandela was imprisoned and where the players see what he had to actually endure), than they should also be able to forgive, and move on in bringing together the new South Africa- both black and whites.  Mandela knows and gambles ultimately on the unifying power of Sport itself and particularly the Springboks who are revered by White South Africans, but hated by Blacks as they represented a symbol of apartheid and opporession.

Slowly through a series of political maneuvers and with the help of Francois Pienaar who slowly begins to understand and believe in Mandela's plan, and even begins to understand what it means to be South African, and redefines his national identity.  How Mandela does this is in my opinion the result of some real political genious and courage.

Clint Eastwood, once again, delivers a terrific film.  There are just so many moments of this movie that I absolutely love and cannot wait to see again.  So many minor characters that leave grand impressions (like Mandela's head of security and many of the white security forces who are working with Mandela's security team to keep him alive and safe). The scenes never feel forced or cliched.  It is just beautifully done, and I would recommend this to anyone.  I believe that you will turn off your DVD player once this film is over with a sense of wonderment at just incredible this all was, and moreso, that it was true, and you will repeat those words, ""I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul."", Invictus ""unconquerable"".

3938400,4,B002JCSWVG,"""Invictus,"" Clint Eastwood's latest film as director, is about the 1995 Rugby World Cup'held in South Africa, but it is not just about the sports or this particular event. The film is really about leadership in a divided country, represented by Nelson Mandela's decision to support the Springboks, the South African national rugby team. As far as the against-the-odds storyline goes, ""Invictus"" feels a little predictable. What is great about the film is that Eastwood has created an insightful portrait of a national leader without making it preachy.

Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as Nelson Mandela, who was elected President of South Africa in 1994. He is aware that this is a most difficult task and knows any hasty or premature decision would lead the nation torn apart into confusion. Changing the national rugby team's color and name could result in more social tension, so the president shows up himself in a meeting of the South African Sports Committee, not to order, but to convince.

One day Nelson Mandela invites the rugby team's captain Franois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to his office. His intention is too clear though he never says it aloud. He chose the Springboks as a symbol for the country's unity. That means the national team, then not a very strong club, must win the World Cup. Everyone thought it was impossible. Of course, he knows better.

Maybe ""Invictus"" is not what you are looking for. As a rugby film, the film falls short of excitement that sports film provide, as the rugby scenes (especially the final game) often emphasizes the reactions of the audiences, not the game itself. As a bio-pic ""Invictus"" depicts mostly the short period after Nelson Mandela took office as president in 1994. His private life and Robben Island prison are only briefly shown.

After all, ""Invictus"" belongs to Morgan Freeman, who quietly rules the screen with his presence. It is an inspirational film made with Eastwood's sure-handed direction and Freeman's towering performance as Nelson Mandela.",1269475200,,2011,5.048192771084337

Only someone who was there can tell you the emotional impact of that game and what Nelson Mandela and Francois Pienaar (captain of the Springbok rugby team) achieved. For several hours after that game there was not a single crime in South Africa. The whole country united as one to spur our team on. I, unfortunately, did not attend the actual game but I was outside that stadium and the fellowship and goodwill that emanated from it had to be experienced. I went to see the movie with my youngest daughter here in the USA. She was only 8 years old at the time of that game. She could well recall the impact of the emotion and, for me, it was a pleasure moment relived. The movie did it justice and the two actors performed very well in their roles as two South Africans. I loved the movie and definitely want to see it again. Always a South African. We are a nation of such spirit.",1268092800,28,999,4.2631578947368425
3938402,5,B002JCSWVG,"Clint Eastwood was probably the only filmmaker who could produce a film on Nelson Mandela that centered on a side event that became a major initiative in the history of South Africa and the world. He chose to center the film on the Springboks and their victory in the World Cup of 1995. That was a brilliant idea since it showed Mandela as a real transformer of human beings. It also brilliantly proves man does not make history. A certain thickness of imbecility was needed to pile up in the minds of some not to see that the enslaved majority of the South African population could not remain slaves for ever. Let my people go. The choice, if it is a choice and not the only logical sequel of the fifty preceding years that Mandela does was to center his own action on a sports event that could unify the people in a victory. And we can see how little it takes to attract the attention and the heart of the other, a cup of tea for instance served by the President to his guest Franois, like Jesus washing the feet of his disciples before the Last Supper, though forgiveness is not that easy, and yet easier for the victims of the bad treatment than for the people who inflicted that bad treatment. Those had to become aware of the hardship of that treatment to finally be conscious enough to forgive themselves and to forgive the victims. Clint Eastwood then adds some symbols to strike our eyes: the little black boy carried by the white cops on their shoulders after the victory. The green Springboks cap Mandela is wearing at the end, not as a provocation of the All Blacks, but as a symbol of his support to his team and as a symbol of the unity of the country around their team. This film is first of all emotional for us who have lived these dark years and harbored for a night or several some AWOL special force soldiers who were deserting apartheid. And how many pages of ANC press releases have we translated for the whole world to know about their fight. And yet we wonder at the end who is the main character of this story. Nelson Mandela or Franois Pienaar. This appears clearly in the remarks these two exchange when Mandela gives the cup to Franois. ""Thank you Franois for what you have done for South Africa."" ""No, Mister President thank you for what you have done for South Africa."" And the green Springboks cap Nelson Mandela wears all the time is not a provocation to the All Blacks, but the sign of his support to his team, and the symbol of the reunification of South Africa thanks to that sports event. Then the answer Franois makes to the journalist when this one asks him if he was encourage in his fight by the 63,000 people in the Stadium, is prophetic: ""We were not supported by 63,000 people but by the 43 million South Africans."" That makes us very humble in front of history that no one can stop, than some can only slow down, ,and some others encourage and help in its own direction. And we will forget Henry Kissinger's answer when he refused to support Nelson Mandela, the political prisoner that he accused of being a communist. One of these details in history that get lost in the pages of some encyclopedia and then is forgotten by humanity.

Would it have been to difficult to find two South African actors who can play the lead roles? This is not to say Freeman and Damon are not good in the movie. Damon in particular is wonderful.

That being said, the movie stumbles around too much to build any kind of intensity. That is a pity given the inspiration nature of the story. Too often we come across movies which fail because of a bad or non-existent story line. But this is a case where the movie failed the story.

I am sure this movie will garner some awards just like the other Oscar fodder which Clint Eastwood has been putting out in the last couple of years.

3938407,5,B002JCSWVG,"Turning a story with a sports theme into a good movie is often a challenge.  Too often, the viewer is left with clich&eacute;s.  This is not the case with ""Invictus"".  Clint Eastwood as director and producer has crafted a wonderful and moving tale.  It deserves a wide audience.

The sport of Rugby Union is little known in America but the use of big name stars such as Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon playing the South African captain Francois Pienaar works well.  They were both truly convincing.  Damon in particular seemed to master the Afrikaans accent.

""Invictus"" is touching.  I frequently found myself almost moved to tears.  The story of how Mandela was able to look beyond simple revenge and move forward in the spirit of reconciliation was uplifting.  If only other nations could follow this example.  Mandela had much to be bitter about but proved that he was a bigger man.  In this way, he further condemned apartheid to the dustbin of history where it belongs.

Many people will know the story of the 1995 World Cup.  South Africa as the host nation rose from the ranks of relative easy beats to become champions.  However, in Clint Eastwood's hands we are provided with more than a simple tale of underdog victory.  This is a very tired story.  Instead, Eastwood homes in on both the bigger picture and the touching interplay between Mandela and Pienaar.  Eastwood is getting better with age.  When most men are in retirement at his age, he continues to dazzle.  He is an inspiration himself.

3938409,4,B002JCSWVG,"So-so in Soweto

""Invictus"" tells the story of how newly-installed South African president Nelson Mandela sought racial peace in his country be reaching out to the national rugby team, beloved of whites. The film is utterly inspirational and often quite moving. Morgan Freeman plays Mandela with dignity and intelligence; Matt Damon plays rugby captain Francois Pienaar with tightly-wound intensity. Having travelled to South Africa, my wife and I were thrilled to see some of the sights around Cape Town. Robben Island, Table Mountain and even the Ferryman's Tavern were prominently featured in the film. Two prominent South African musical groups -- Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Soweto String Quartet, were given roles.

But the film itself had a lassitude that took away from its intense subject. Though it was set only a year or to after decades of brutal white minority rule, the film's emotions were muted. For those who don't know much about South Africa, little historical context was provided. And certain symbolic story arcs -- for instance the stance of the rugby team toward the new Xhosa national anthem -- were raised, and then dropped without development. Pienaar himself was an enigma. As a beneficiary of the old system, one might have expected to see him struggle with the demands of being ruled by those once considered terrorists. But none of this was developed.

As an inspirational film about how leaders must sometimes buck popular wisdom to lead people to a wider vision, Invictus is incomparable. As a means by which the story of South Africa can be introduced to an American audience, it is adequate,. But as a film, it lacks energy and character. The last quarter of the film, devolving into the clichd ""underdog in the championship,"" was especially disappointing. This three star movie gets four from me, but only for old times sake.",1263513600,,1864,5.045454545454546
3938410,5,B002JCSWVG,"'Invictus' is a Latin term meaning invincible, or unconquerable.  It is also the title of an important poem, one which Nelson Mandela found inspiring during his long walk to victory, penned in the 1800s of the same title, which includes these famous words:

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

Mandela faced perhaps even more formidable challenges upon becoming the first post-Apartheid president of South Africa than he had trying to end Apartheid -- how does one manage this kind of change, this kind of forgiveness, this kind of reconciliation?  Perhaps the most important scene in the film for me was the one in which Mandela discusses with Francois Pienaar, the South African rugby team's captain, what kind of leadership philosophy one needs to have, particularly when faced with a seemingly hopeless task that most have written off as unobtainable.  Leadership by example is important here; courage in the face of adversity and perseverance even as all appear negative is also key.

Mandela is played admirably by Morgan Freeman; Freeman has been a friend to Mandela for many years, and even so found the role daunting.  How does one portray a living legend?  Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon; Damon recounts in press information for the film his meeting with Pienaar, and how Pienaar, an actual rugby player, is so much larger physically than Damon (who, despite his athletic build, is of a more average size).  Clint Eastwood, now a master film maker, was able through his camera work to disguise this fact -- rugby players in general are larger than average!

The rugby scenes are very well done; I saw this film with an audience where most had never been exposed to rugby before, but they had no problem figuring out the basic pattern of play, and so problems with rules and strategies did not become a hindrance.  The political scenes, which could also have the potential of descending into arcana that would lose a non-South African audience, were also well crafted to show important issues without delving into the minutiae of politics that end up being distracting.  The on-field and off-field struggles are juxtaposed, and the film shows how the rugby World Cup helped to bring the divided nation together -- of course, this would be to simplify history far too much, but it was an important step.

The victory of the Springboks, with Mandela handing the victory cup to Pienaar, is considered by many to be one of the greatest moments in sports history (the BBC testifies to this, among others).

Overall, this is a feel-good film that has important historical and social themes.  The cell on Robben Island, where Mandela spent more than half of his nearly three-decade political imprisonment, was actually used in the film -- an important element that helps show the importance of Mandela's actions, and the power of how what might have been quite legitimate hatred and desire for vengeance had become an even more powerful drive for unity and reconciliation.

This is an important film, and worthy of viewing and discussion.  It qualifies as one of the most significant South African films, also, as much of the cast are from South Africa and much of the filming was done at or near the actual venues of this taken-from-true-life film.

3938411,3,B002JCSWVG,"I love sports movies, and I am quite a big fan of Matt Damon. Throw in Morgan Freeman, and I was sold. I wanted so badly to like it, but it was only okay.

The movie opens with some sensationally remade news footage of Nelson Mandela (with Morgan Freeman inserted) to provide backstory. Mandela takes over the presidency of a very divided South Africa, and he tries to unite the country around its rugby team. As the story begins, the white fans cheer for the Springboks, while the black fans cheer against them, no matter what team they're playing. Matt Damon plays the rugby team captain, Francois Pienaar.

The good: The acting was good, and at times great. Morgan Freeman completely captured Nelson Mandela's frailty and disposition. Matt Damon was good, although I didn't think he had too much to do. The two stars of this movie for me, however, were two supporting actresses, Leleti Khumalo and Sibongile Nojila. The women both played small roles; Khumalo worked for Mandela and Nojila was the Pienaar's maid. In the hands of other actresses, perhaps I wouldn't even have noticed them, but stealing a movie from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon is quite a feat, and I hope other take note. On the visual side, Eastwood never disappoints with aerial shots. There were quite a few breathtaking views, but otherwise, the movie was nowhere near his other works, especially the visually stunning Changeling (one of 2008's best movies, in my opinion).

The not so good: This movie falls somewhere between a sports movie and a political movie, and for me, it failed at both. I admit, I know little to nothing about rugby. The climactic sports scene (it's hardly a spoiler, you know there will be one) was dull. I didn't understand how points were scored, how insurmountable leads are, or what the time on the clock was counting up or down to, and thus, I wasn't especially invested in the action. I knew the outcome, but good sports movies excel at providing an amazing, emotional magical journey. This film lacked magic. Not only did I not cry, I didn't even get goosebumps. I should be the target audience for this film; I adore sports movies, and I enjoy political movies. I like the actors in it. It certainly wasn't bad, but it simply didn't grab me. At the end, all I could say was eh. I didn't like it; I didn't dislike it. It wasn't memorable for me, despite being about a fascinating time.",1262304000,6,2394,4.668246445497631
3938412,2,B002JCSWVG,"I can't believe the overwhelming praise for this movie. Sure, it scores as a feel-good sports flick, but that's about it I'm afraid. I believe it fails on two major fronts. First, this film does not portray the game of rugby very well, especially at the top level. The players in the movie looked like they were playing in a fourth-grade club match, not a test; there was only one backline move in the whole game, the 'scissors', that was shown again and again; and when the players came off the field they looked as if they had just done the gardening, not played 80 minutes of intense rugby, ready to throw their guts out. Why didn't the director make the players run around the block five times, then walk on to the movie set so they as least they would have looked somewhat knackered? The semi-final against France was a match of the highest drama, with the French denied a try in the dying seconds, tackled short of the line, that would have won them the game. This film showed nothing of that drama. And the Haka, or war dance, was pathetic to say the least. The second failure I thought was a reluctance to show the history of Apartheid,as this was indeed the background to the whole film. There was so reference to the Soweto uprisings of the 1970s nor of the sport and trade boycotts of South Africa. I mean, it didn't even show Mandela walking out of prison. What a great opeing that would have been. A great chance I feel was lost to educate the world, especially Americans, about South Africa and its history, which would have enhanced the movie a great deal, and, of course, to educate the world about 'real' rugby.

3938413,4,B002JCSWVG,"""Invictus,"" produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and an activist who strove to end apartheid, establish universal suffrage, and bring about free and democratic elections in South Africa.  After he became president, Mandela set out to heal the deep divisions that poisoned the political, social, and cultural atmosphere of his homeland.  He looked to the future, although he would never completely forget the twenty-seven years that he had spent as a political prisoner.  Mandela chose an unusual vehicle to propel his campaign of healing--rugby.  The Sprinbok team, beloved of white Afrikaners, was for the majority of black South Africans, a symbol of all that they despised.  Much to the consternation of his constituents, Mandela decided to publicly support the underdog Springboks and their captain, Francois Pienaar, hoping that a common interest in winning the Rugby World Cup would unite blacks and whites. In addition, he believed that if the Springboks were to capture the World Cup, it would shine a positive light on a nation that had previously been shunned by much of the world.

Clint Eastwood is unable to avoid the clichs that are characteristic of come-from-behind films featuring a weak team that strives, against all odds, to win a major championship.  The close-up scenes of hulking and grunting men pummeling and tackling one another are repetitious and a bit off-putting.  For most moviegoers, however, the reason to see ""Invictus"" is not to revel in the game of rugby, but rather to enjoy Morgan Freeman's subtle and understated portrayal of a man so charming, eloquent, and determined that he manages to disarm even those who dismissed him as a upstart.  Mandela takes the high road, envisioning a time when blacks and whites will live together in harmony.

Matt Damon is fine as Francois Pienaar, captain of the Springboks, who cannot believe that his hapless team has become a national symbol.  As he gets to know Mandela, Pienaar grows to respect and admire the man, and learns how important it is to inspire others and set an example that they can emulate.  Other standouts are Tony Kgoroge as the hot-tempered Jason Tshabalala (the head of Mandela's security detail) who is in no mood to reconcile with the enemy.  Adjoa Andoh brings dignity and intelligence to the role of Brenda Mazibuko, Mandela's personal assistant.  She is the voice of reason, questioning the wisdom of wasting political capital on rugby when South Africa is on the verge of economic collapse.

Morgan Freeman said that Mandela ""moves people for the better; that is his calling in life.""  This feel-good movie offers few surprises.  Some critics have called it bland and safe, and that is probably a fair criticism.  Nevertheless, ""Invictus"" is worth seeing for Freeman's depiction of a man who chose to forgive those whom he had every reason to hate.",1262217600,,2940,5.064315352697095
3938414,3,B002JCSWVG,"Whenever I see the name ""Clint Eastwood"" associated with a new moving coming to theaters, I automatically think of such incredible films as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, and Gran Torino.  Perhaps I am just spoiled by Eastwood's spotless track record, but that is the reality of the situation.  With that in mind, Invictus does not live up to the billing...but it still is a very honorable effort.

Basically, the film takes place primarily in the country of South Africa, where Nelson Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freeman) has come to power and is striving to bridge the gap between blacks and whites after decades of apartheid rule.  Mandela seizes upon the country's terrible rugby team, stocked primarily by high-brow, burly white men, as a symbol of unity for the country.  He tabs Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to captain the team and make them respectable (if not a whole lot more) heading into the World Cup.  The rest, as they say, is history.

Now, I can't say that this film was outright bad in any way.  The race-relations message is one that resonates, the rugby team is certainly inspirational, and the acting is pretty good as well, led by the remarkable Freeman as one of the world's most storied leaders.  Yet, unlike ""Torino"" or ""Baby"", the word I would use to describe this film is ""understated"".  Instead of walloping viewers over the head with such heavy topics as euthanasia, religion, or death, in this effort Eastwood takes a much more low-key approach.  There is drama, yes, and plenty of inspiration, but it just doesn't feel as epic as it could have been.  Whether this was Eastwood trying to ""follow the facts"" as much as possible, or the real-life story just not providing the high drama of a fully scripted film, I'm not sure.

Thus, if you are heading to the theater expecting utter greatness like I was, you will likely leave disappointed.  However, if the topics/events/times in the film are of significant personal or cultural importance to you, then Invictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired.",1262131200,11,2103,4.903954802259887
3938415,2,B002JCSWVG,"Note: This review may contains spoilers--'Invictus' is designed to be a 'feel-good' movie about relationships between blacks and whites. The setting is South Africa beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and his subsequent ascent to the South African presidency a short time later. Morgan Freeman does a great job in 'channeling' the great man and you really feel as if you're watching Mandela himself. When the Oscars come up, Freeman has a very good shot at copping the Oscar for Best Actor.

Clint Eastwood's strategy is to depict Nelson Mandela's program for racial reconciliation through the narrow prism of International Rugby. While there are a few interesting glimpses of Mandela interacting with his main assistant and some of his counselors, little of his personal life is shown (there is a brief scene where he's depicted as being alienated from his daughter who regards him as something of a sell-out). By the second half, Mandela is reduced to being basically a cheerleader for the South African Rugby team. Still, the sheer humanity of Mandela is always at the forefront, with his emphasis on forgiveness.

I liked the first half of Invictus better than the second. There's a good scene where Mandela tries to persuade a group of his constituents (a Sports Federation) not to disenfranchise the rugby team. Mandela, in Christ-like fashion, urges the crowd to 'turn the other cheek' and support the team despite their identification of the white players with the apartheid era. Despite their initial rejection, blacks in South Africa gradually come to root for the team. One way they're won over is after Mandela asks the team to tour the shanty towns and introduce rugby to poor black children. It helps that there's one black player on the team who becomes a national figure. But when Mandela visits the team before a big game and congratulates each player individually, he's sending a signal that he's for whites as much as blacks. And the white players (who are initially depicted as being quite alienated and angry after Mandela becomes President) gradually soften up too: in one poignant scene, they go on a tour of the prison where Mandela was held for 27 years. Later they're not afraid to sing the new South African anthem with their black countrymen.

Less successful are the scenes involving Mandela's bodyguards. The tension between the black and white bodyguards at the beginning is quite understandable. But virtually none of the characters are ever fleshed out. It takes a team victory in the Rugby World Cup to get them all hugging one another. But the camaraderie seems quite superficial. One wonders if everyone will be so touchy-feeley once all the excitement has worn off.

Invictus completely loses steam in the second half. There's virtually no suspense since the film's outcome is a forgone conclusion. What's worse is that the idea of an antagonist is lost as the film plods along. The tension between blacks and whites is palpable at the beginning but as the focus shifts to the rugby team itself, where is the conflict? Good movies have a moment where the protagonist faces a moment of crisis leading to a 'dark moment of the soul'. The best Invictus offers us is when Mandela collapses after being overworked. It's not enough!

The awkwardness of the entire screenplay is embodied in the relationship between the team captain, Francois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon and Mandela. They have one scene together when Mandela invites Pinaar to tea. We find out next to nothing about Pienaar but maybe that's because there's not a lot to find out. Damon runs around a lot on the field but only briefly confronts his teammates who are initially reluctant to embrace Mandela's plan for reconciliation. Again, where is the conflict?

As an American who is unfamiliar with the rules of rugby, I was bored watching scene after scene of grown men groping one another without protective equipment. Since Eastwood really had no exciting climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'. For rugby aficionados, this might prove to be orgasmic. As for ignorant Americans such as myself, I never thought I'd be desperate to tune into next Sunday's football game so quickly.

Some have claimed that Invictus is just another film about race relations from the white man's perspective. Maybe so but I prefer to view it as primarily a mediocre sports film. On the plus side, if one wishes to feel good without thinking too hard, then one can indulge oneself in this rather superficial glimpse of racial harmony. While Invictus fails in the drama department, Morgan Freeman's performance as the great and inspiring Mandela will make you look at race relations from the glass being half full and not half empty.",1261699200,9,4818,4.940740740740741

3938417,4,B002JCSWVG,"During his 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela regularly turned to a poem Called Invictus, and found profound inspiration.

During his time as President he continued to turn to this poem, and knowing it by heart, wrote it out long hand, and to the Captain of the Sprinboks passed it, who found profound inspiration.

During my life, I found profound inspiration in Nelson Mandela, and if a man can live in the unfair divided regime called apartheid, can spend so much time in prison, and emerge wise instead of rancorous, and can become president of a nation so divided, it raises the bar of human possibility, and inspires us to do better. If Mandela can solve the unsolvable problems of South Africa, if the Berlin Wall can fall, then cannot my own country's problem be solved, could there be peace in Nothern Ireland.  All of these things which once seemed impossible have come to pass.

And Invictus the movie invites us to see Mandela in elegant action, uniting a divided nation, averting civil unrest and civil war, reviving the sport of apartheid (rugby), saving the Springboks from being disbanded, and playing a pivotal role in inspiring their triumphs.

Morgan Freeman won best Supporting Actor for Million Dollar Baby playing Clint's sidekick, and played Clint's sidekick in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unforgiven/dp/B000P0J0DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unforgiven</a>.

Morgan Freeman impresses as Mandela, who he knows personally, and does an outstanding job.  As much if not more is conveyed through a nod, a gesture and a facial expression than through words.  Matt Damon impresses as the Rugby Captain.  Having played rugby myself, he totally convinces in his body language and movement as a rugby player.

Clint Eastwood does an impressive job outside his normal territory and familiar genre, making the rugby scenes very true to life.  Usually the cameras are off field, here they are up close and personal in the thick of the action.

My one critique of the movie is that it lacks something Hollywood likes, namely the conflict, drama, and the hubris of the characters.

In Invictus, the great Nelson Mandela adversity has already happened before the events of this movie happen, so the great dramas of his life remain unexplored, and the drama of his wife Winnie being charged with murder also remains unexplored.  A quality movie made about all that, would surely win many awards.

Invictus remains a great movie, it's funny sometimes, it's gripping, it's inpiring, it's even exciting.  Although it's Morgan Freeman's movie, it's Eastwood's humor that's pervasive. It's a slice of Mandela, but not the whole cake. I fully expect Morgan Freeman will get nominated for this performance, and may even win.  I would not be surprised if Eastwood, overlooked last year for his masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gran-Torino-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0020MKTOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gran Torino (Full-Screen Edition)</a>, gets a nod this time as Best Director.

The accompanying plot, of course, was the work of Nelson Mandela in using this victory and its team preparation to try to unify South Africa. From our own trip in 1994, when the country was just opening up, we had an idea that there was much unrest and volatility. The nation was still racially divided, although the Apartheid enforced by a distinct white minority had just ended.

Mandela has never received credit for the job he did in keeping South Africa's peace, while trying to encourage foreign investment. He saw that merely seizing white-owned businesses and infrastructure would only be looting of a fixed amount of wealth. No growth could result from the types of activities that were occurring in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where white minorities had been ousted from power.

As the new President of South Africa, representing an overwhelming black majority, Mandela took a long term view of what was needed. He alienated a considerable portion of his own party to implement his program of racial reconciliation.

The movie provides an exceptional, well integrated blend of sports and far-seeing political strategy.

Some critics have heaped praise on Invictus, claiming that this represents director Clint Eastwood's work ""at the top of his game."" Other critics have carped about what they see as ""trite"" dialog. Perhaps if Mandela had been ranting against his racist predecessors and, even more, against the US, they would have enjoyed the dialog more. One critic claimed that too much artistic license was taken in portraying actual events of Mandela's interaction with the rugby team and its captain. These objections seem trivial.

Others have predicted that Morgan Freeman, in his role of Mandela, is a strong Oscar candidate. I hope that Invictus receives a potful of other rewards as well.

With all the negative, tragic outcomes of recent history and, of course, today's events, it was refreshing and stirring to see the rugby success of the South Africa team. More to the point, it represented a hopeful outcome for the nation as a whole.",1260835200,108,2303,5.092838196286472
3938419,5,B002JCSWVG,"It sure is a unique movie about nation building. I thought Clint Eastwood captured the spirit of what happened during that World Cup perfectly. The All Blacks were more fearsome and the game far more intense than what is portrayed in the movie. But the intensity of the people, that was wonderful.

It is a very beautiful movie, made with a lot of love and care.",1260835200,2,362,4.484848484848484
3938420,4,B002JCSWVG,"INVICTUS is an interesting and often gripping film that nonetheless fails to deliver the emotional or intellectual blow it is clearly meant to.  This is due primarily to what is usually a strength of Clint Eastwood's work as director...and to the somewhat sanitized feel of the story.

The film tells the true story of a small portion of Nelson Mandela's life, when he took a strong interest in the national rugby team of South Africa (the Springboks), because he believed their success would help him unite a divided country AND show the world the potential of the new South Africa.

When we meet the Springboks and their captain (played by Matt Damon, in another understated, naturalistic performance that is quick making him a significant acting force)...they are a team of all but one white player.  They are avidly followed by the white population of South Africa...while at the same time they are playing well below their potential and essentially being lambasted by the media.  In the South Africa of that time (early `90s), the black citizens embraced soccer, and Rugby was the sport that served as a reminder of Apartheid, with the colors and name that symbolized that horrible time.

President Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) senses that he might be able to convince a skeptical white population of his seriousness in being a leader for ALL by taking an interest in rugby.  It's a cynical move that is also sincere at the same time.  Mandela risks the anger of the blacks that elevated him to legendary status by convincing the National Sports commission to allow the Springboks to continue with their name and colors.

All this occurs as the World cup of Rugby is just months away from coming to South Africa.  Mandela knows his efforts will amount to little if the team fails in the early going...so through meetings with Damon, he manages to pass a bit of inspiration down to the team.

In a wonderful and telling scene, we see the Rugby team headed out to teach a rugby camp to kids in a poor, black neighborhood.  At first, the kids are only interested in Chester, the only black man on the team.  They swarm to him...oblivious to the rest of team and to the sport.  Yet we see slowly how these EXTREMELY reluctant coaches embrace their parts a role models and begin to work with the kids.  By the end of the day, all concerned are happily exhausted...and totally thrilled.  The scene is a clich&eacute; in many ways, but it is tidy and effective.  We begin to see how little victories will eventually yield the big victory Mandela (and the team) are hoping for.

As a director, Eastwood always allows for a leisurely pace.  He lets actors breathe.  He lets them pause.  He keeps his camera on them for a second longer than any other director would.  This allows us, sometimes, to feel we know a character better.  We feel we've been invited to share in even the most mundane moments of their lives (this is why GRAN TORINO worked so well...we cared so much about the characters that we overlooked the deeply clich&eacute;d story arc).  But what the story of INVICTUS needs is more of a hurtling, headlong pace.  It ambles, even when the ""pressure cooker"" of the tournament and all it means for the country comes to a head.  There is little sense of urgency...and the film really could have used it.  I was always interested...but never to the point of giving myself over to emotion.

That's also due in part to the fact that we've got two parallel stories (Mandela's and the team's).  They frequently intersect...but they rarely bounce off each other in unexpected ways.  Yes, it's a true story, but it takes such a leisurely, mostly expected course that it feels like a clich&eacute;d sports movie.  But we haven't thoroughly invested in the Springboks because we've spent so much time with Mandela, that the sports accomplishments seem secondary.  And our knowledge of Mandela is reduced almost exclusively to something akin to ""#1 Rugby fan.""  Clearly, he was a much, much more interesting and complex man...yet we are only shown very limited glimpses of him.  We see his keen yet instinctive grasp of the politics of race in his country.  We believe his desire to forgive the sins of the past so his country can move forward (his actions along these lines are the most inspiring moments of the film...and most come fairly early).  We get just the tiniest sense of his troubled domestic wife, although his wife Winnie is never mentioned by name.  I won't say he's portrayed as a one-dimensional saint...but it's close to it.

The reason Mandela ISN'T just a one-dimensional saint is because of Morgan Freeman.  Eastwood's love of allowing his actors to act truly frees up the best in Freeman.  With MILLION DOLLAR BABY, Freeman won his first Oscar.  There's a chance he could win #2 with his latest work under Eastwood.  (I should also mention that one of Freeman's most overlooked performances was his stunning role in Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.)  No actor is better than Freeman at taking one-dimensional, saintly characters (everything from DEEP IMPACT to even SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) and giving them an inner life that is frequently only expressed by the subtlest changes of expression.  We're accustomed to Freeman's dulcet tones (what a great speaking voice he has)...but the reason he's in another category is because of the little things we barely notice.  And he is not only the perfect choice to play Mandela, he's probably the ONLY choice (in the way Forest  Whitaker was perfect for Idi Amin...not only was the acting outstanding, but the physical resemblance alone is a plus).

In the end, I felt more educated that enlightened.  My mind had new things in it...but not my heart so much.  (There are a few moments, such as the sobering visit to Mandela's jail cell, that help to enlighten us as to how large an accomplishment Mandela's forgiveness was.)  If I had understood Rugby better, perhaps the games themselves would have been more exciting...but I suspect most of the action in them is fairly generic.  If I had seen more of Mandela's other work, perhaps I would have felt a greater sense of HIS accomplishment.

In the end, there is much to admire in INVICTUS, and I certainly would encourage everyone to see it.  It is also the kind of film that will cause lots of folks to learn more about Mandela & South Africa.  (I can even see high school classes using it as a springboard for much more learning.)  But in the end, I couldn't help feeling just a little disappointed.",1260748800,3,6506,4.7761862130707256
3938421,4,B002JCSWVG,"Before you buy the movie tickets and order your popcorn, be sure to take about five minutes or so and brush up on the game of rugby. Then head for the theatre door, grab a seat and watch Morgan Freeman portray South Africa president Nelson Mandela in Clint Eastwood's latest gem,Invictus. In 1995, Mandela used the sport of rugby to bring a nation together, and now, Freeman, in 2009, uses his talent as an actor to show the world on the silver screen how one man's courage and fortitude brought together a nation of 43 million. As for a quick-reference guide on rugby, it is football without pads and it is rough. Forty-minute halves and no timeouts. No forward passing...and if you have a kicker who can boot the ball a long way,that will help. Field goals are worth three points, extra points are two, and if you can battle your way across the goal line it is worth five points. There you go. Of course, there's a few more rules (but not many), but that's enough to make you a little more knowledgeable than the fella next to you who just asked his friend next to him,""What is the score?""",1260748800,9,1091,4.432835820895522
3938422,4,B002JCSWVG,"The story of 'Invictus' centers around newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela's attempt to move his people past the apartheid that has plagued his country for so long. An attending of a rugby match, and watching the fans reaction -- divided down racial lines -- to their home country's team, inspires Mandela to contact Francois Pienaar, captain of the South African Springboks rugby team, to see if sport can be used to bring the people together.

One concern I had about the success of this film in the U.S. is that it centers around rugby, a sport which has never been embraced by Americans. I wondered if people would be able to identify with it, but the movie is filmed in such a way that prior knowledge of the sport of rugby (of which I have absolutely NONE) is unnecessary. There are stand-up-and-cheer moments in the film, but it's difficult to label this movie as a sports film. It's much more than that. There is a lot of standard sports movie fare within this film, but I wouldn't call it cliche in any way.

This film is a probable Oscar contender for Best Picture, but Morgan Freeman's nomination for Best Actor, I would label as a certainty. Matt Damon, as South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar was quite possibly the best I've ever seen him. The South African soundtrack added some great flavor to the film.

At the risk of sounding corny, it's been a while since I saw a film that I found inspiring. I would not call this film director Clint Eastwood's best work, but I absolutely found inspiration in 'Invictus'.",1260748800,,1551,4.653284671532846
3938423,5,B002JCSWVG,"....though it is NOT a biography of Nelson Mandela, and it is not a sports movie about winning the game against all odds. If you can step outside those possibilities it is a wonderful study in leadership style and method that prevented a newly unified South Africa decending into the sort of mess that Rhodesia/Zimbabwe did.

As South African friends of mine confirmed - Morgan Freeman IS Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon is Francois Pinaud with an impeccable accent.

The film portrays a wonderful moment in history when a Rainbow Nation rose and displayed the best side of Truth and Reconciliation to the world",1260662400,2,609,4.846153846153846
3938424,4,B002JCSWVG,"How can one not have huge expectations going into INVICTUS - the story of Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) using the Rugby World Cup of 1995 as a rallying point to help unify his troubled post-apartheid country, and forming a bond with the young captain of the traditionally-named (and hated by many blacks) Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)?  Especially when it's directed by Clint Eastwood, whose two previous collaborations with Freeman won Best Picture and Director Oscars for Clint, with Freeman winning a Best Supporting Actor prize for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  And being a huge Clint Eastwood fan who has seen everything he's directed or starred in....well, let's just say there are few films this year that I was looking forward to more.

Of course massive expectations - however impossible to avoid - are frequently going to engender disappointment, and such is the case here to some extent - though there is more to like than not overall.  Freeman is just as great as I expected him to be - no, he doesn't sound exactly like Mandela, but he gets the cadences and speech patterns down pretty well, the charm and the moments of boyish impishness, and especially the sense of a troubled, lonely inner life that he has managed through supreme will to tame and use to his advantage.  This Mandela is a man determined to unite a country almost through sheer will, a man willing to be autocratic and domineering when he feels there is no other way, and a man who knows that winning over his enemies is just as important as keeping his friends.

Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar is something of a cypher, a seemingly apolitical man interested in little beyond rugby, a leader himself but one who seemingly has even less chance of pulling his team from the brink of disaster than Mandela has of pulling his country up.  What Pienaar needs is confidence and spirit - something the president has in abundance; and what Mandela needs is a rallying point that both blacks and whites can get behind; obviously, in true sports-movie manner, they find each other and clearly couldn't succeed without both putting forth every effort.

It's not the sports cliches that are really the problem here; after all, this is based on a true story, South Africa really WAS a giant underdog to win the World Cup, and they really did prevail against all odds.  And it's not Freeman or Damon, or any of the other fine actors; rather it's the shorthand that Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham use to show the country coming together which lacks substance and feels in the end the most cliched.  The Pienaars have a black maid who keeps quiet through most of the film, but finally gets her moments; the president's bodyguard staff is a mix of blacks and whites who initially distrust and dislike each other, and come to grudgingly respect each other, and so on.  Meanwhile little of the changing nature of the South African people in general is seen over the 5-year timespan of the film, and little of the attitudes of Pienaar's team, the Springboks, to becoming a symbol as much as a rugby team.

Still the emotional power of the story does come through, in particular through the deep inner life that Freeman's Mandela manages to convey, a wisdom that understands something about how much more important reconciliation and forward-thinking is than revenge and recriminations.  I can't take credit for this thought, but I will mention that it's interesting how this film, like so much of Eastwood's past work is in a sense focused on revenge; except that in this case, revenge is seen as unambiguously wrong by the protaganist (and by extension, we the audience) and not to be applied.  The demons are exorcised, and we get a truly positive and life-affirming ending - one of the few in the director's entire filmography.  Sure, we all know that South Africa isn't a paradise now, and still has a great many problems; but the promise of someone like Mandela is I think worth holding forth still - even if it is more than a little romantacized.  The fact that 'the whole story' is not altogether well-articulated isn't entirely Clint's fault or the other participants; this is too large a story to be told in one film, one way, and if Eastwood wasn't fully up to the task, his heart was certainly in the project, and I think what he did get right was well worth doing, and seeing.",1260662400,6,4366,4.755291005291006
