8196153,3,B000QGDIH0,"Well,I don't know what I can really add that hasn't already been said, but here goes:This movie is BAD. Not like ""cool"" bad, just plain B-A-D! I know the film makers are just kids and I know they didn't have much, if any kind of budget, but this was just terrible! Obviously, the people who created this celluloid nightmare are horror movie fans but I got the impression that while they enjoy watching horror movies, they really haven't learned anything from them! The amateur acting not-with-standing, the pacing is non-existent, the ""special-effects"" poorly executed ( too many blood spurts, gang!) and way too many nonsensical plot holes like: do people chained up in a cellar for an entire year STILL find time to groom their hair? Can you really kidnap a girl from her home in BROAD DAYLIGHT and drag her back to that same cellar without attracting attention? If the cop who discovers two kids chained up in that self-same cellar, fails to call for immediate back-up and then falls victim to the killer, don't you think either of the kids would have at least tried to go for the GUN from the fallen body or, at the very least, GRAB THE RADIO AND CALL FOR HELP?!Oh, that's right, they did find the radio and tried calling for help but it took them 20 MINUTES to figure that out!!! Wow. By this time, you're probably wondering why I gave this ""Golden Turkey"" candidate THREE STARS! This is not a mistake! Having said what I didn't like about this movie I now must say that ""Mr. Halloween"" falls into that ""it's so bad it's good"" category: if you would like to view this movie as if it were screened on Mystery Science Theater 3000, then you are in for a real ""treat""! The only way I managed to watch this film all the way through was to start adding my own dialogue and sound effects and instantly ""Mr. Halloween"" became high camp! Seen from this point of view I found myself giggling uncontrollably at the god-awful dialogue, snickering at the tone-deaf keyboard background music and chuckling at the over-the-top mannerisms of Bill Loomis as he attempts to look terrifying and coming across more like a constipated auto-mechanic! To the film makers,I must give you props for finding a distributor, but if you're going to make another film, please try your hand at a comedy as I feel that's more your style! Good luck!",1336521600,,2322,4.624697336561743
8196154,2,B000QGDIH0,"Wow, where to begin with this movie. It was just plain dumb. It has bland terrible dialog, they overdo the fake blood splatter, and the actors have no emotion in their voice. A man named Bill Loomis (who plays himself) is called Mr. Halloween because he runs a cheesy haunted house in this garage. He kidnaps teenagers and uses their body parts as props. Jill, played by Shannon Eastman, is probably the only worthy character, and that's not saying a lot. It is very stupid, but somewhat entertaining. Unless you're desperate for a bad movie, I wouldn't recommend MR. HALLOWEEN!!!",1318204800,,580,4.81
8196155,3,B000QGDIH0,"Upon viewing, this film seems to have two strikes against it, and Sandy Koufax just took the mound to close.

To say the acting is amateurish in almost every case would be being kind; the camera work, whilst there are some really outstanding shots and good composition, is shaky and inconsistent; even the quality of the film is grainy and pixelated, tiling VERY apparent on the blacks and a lot of distortion in long shots; the sound work is hit and miss, a good bit of the dialogue fading into the background behind the overly-amped and D-grade soundtrack; the story is a pretty good one, not entirely original, but done in a convincing and different way, but there are several elements that don't immediately make an overt amount of sense...

...and all of that sounds like a terrible excuse for killing an hour of your time watching it.

However...

When you sit back and take into account that this film was done by a group of basically kids, with probably about two-hundred bucks worth of budget, borrowed equipment, and a weekend or two to work on it, you have to see it with different eyes.  I doubt seriously anyone who worked on this film got paid a red cent up front; it was composed purely of passion and dogged determination to get something worthwhile put together in a genre they obviously all love.  They sought to bring out a little originality rather than re-hash something someone else had already done, and whereas you can see some elements in the film you've seen before, overall I think they were successful.

The story is simplistic, but sometimes those are the best kind:  A small town in New York (the actual hometown of the filmmakers) has an extremely unusual amount of teen disappearances, and local law seems stymied (well, actually, disinterested, but that's a plot point).  In this same little town is a guy named Loomis who runs an annual ""haunted house"" in his garage every Halloween (again, an actual event in this town), and the local teens think he may be the culprit in the disappearances...indeed, even using the bodies of his victims as props.  Impromptu investigations begin, and the fun starts.

For this to be a no-budget film, the special effects are pretty good (and somewhat over the top, but they were obviously aiming for that), and if you watch it all with an open mind and appreciation for the genre, it genuinely grows on you before the second reel starts.  I'm a fan of indie horror, and can appreciate even the most pedestrian attempts if the heart is in it, and I believe that's the case with this one.

So...casual watchers of the horror flick, you may want to go back, re-read my opening paragraph, and walk on...but you dyed-in-the-wool horrorphiles, if you keep your mind open, will find an enjoyable watch outta this one...don't spend a lot on it, but it's definitely worth seeing.

I give it a solid three stars for the effort, the story, and the pretty good eye for cinematography.

Hat's off to the young Andy Wolf and the family and friends that obviously put so much into this!",1289433600,,3040,4.677298311444653
8196156,2,B000QGDIH0,"There is a chill in the air and soon Halloween will be here again. Maybe that's why i've been digging out horror movies i've yet to watch. Mr. Halloween is probably the only independent horror film i've watched that is nearly two hours long. The story is pretty good and had lots of promise. Then again as i've said before no movie has a good synposis followed by overall, you'll be disappointed with this movie. Mr. Halloween suffers from poor acting and it moves at a very slow pace; it could have been cut down to the standard hour thirty, forty minutes. There is a few good kills and inside the haunted house was good. The ending confused me and I guess I must have missed a cruical part of the film because I was lost. Anyways, a decent pick up for a movie but not the best independent film out there.

As so other reviewers state, the clown on the cover is nowheres to be found within the film.",1251331200,,900,4.294117647058823
8196157,5,B000QGDIH0,"I enjoyed this movie with Mr Halloween cutting up the people and putting them in his Halloween house. He showed people around his house then said to them to get out while they still can. The killer had a crazy look an his face all the time. I was surprised at near the end when the local Sherif didn't set the kids free and just left them there.
At the end Mr Halloween finaly got the girl back again because it had a poster up that she was still missing.

I give this Movie 5 stars.",1211846400,,483,4.03125
8196158,2,B000QGDIH0,All I can say is why waste your money or time. This is so fakey it made me ill. I got to waste my time watching this poor dvd they call a movie. Beeing a Big Fan of Indy horror I was very well not pleased. This is TRASH...,1199750400,,222,3.5510204081632653
8196159,4,B000QGDIH0,"A low budget movie with a great plot. Not bad,considering it's a first time acting gig for most of the cast, the movie sucks you in as it goes along.",1187395200,,149,4.0
8196160,4,B000QGDIH0,"Mr. Halloween is a low-budget supernatural horror movie with lots of blood and gore, mixed up with a little weird humor, that takes place in a real live small town in upstate NY, known as Sauquoit. The basic premise is that large numbers of teenagers from this town have been mysteriously disappearing for quite some time and the local constabulary can't seem to do anything about it.

The chief bad guy, and title character, is a local recluse named Bill Loomis (creepily played by Bill Loomis), who is obsessed with Halloween and who also happens to have died a long time ago, which is a fact that seems to have completely escaped his incredibly obtuse neighbors. Every Halloween Mr. Loomis puts on a haunted house festival in his dilapidated two-story garage for the amusement of the locals, complete with ghosts and mummies and monsters and people getting their heads chopped off by guillotines and so on. What his neighbors don't know, besides the fact that Mr. Loomis is an animated corpse, is that he uses real body parts to create his haunted house monsters, acquiring them from the teenagers he kidnaps and keeps prisoner in his basement until he needs a new body part or two for his creations.

The local sheriff seems to be, besides a total jerk, completely clueless as to what is happening to the kids. For some odd reason he manages to keep his job, despite the fact that about 27-bazillion local kids have mysteriously disappeared during the last year or two, and also despite the fact that he doesn't seem to be at all interested in finding out what's going on.

Meanwhile, some of the local kids, being much less obtuse than their parents, have gotten suspicious of Mr. Loomis and have decided to conduct a little investigation of their own, which of course, this being a horror film, might not be good for them.

Also, and again meanwhile, the deputy sheriff, who is, unlike his boss, not a total jerk, and who is also the brother of one of the kidnaped kids, conducts his own investigation, which might not be good for him, either.

So, is the sheriff completely clueless, or is he something else? What's going to happen to the current batch of kidnaped kids? Will they live or die? What's going to happen to the deputy? Will he live or die? Why is a dead guy able to remain on the local tax rolls, despite his deadness, and how does he manage to keep on killing people without any of the locals catching on? And how many ways can this dead guy make other people dead, and which body part or parts will he remove next?

For the answers to these important questions, and others, watch the darned flick. It's a hoot, and a good example of a funky and gory, low-budget horror movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone who likes funky and gory, low-budget horror movies. And don't forget the popcorn. Mr. Halloween would be disappointed if you did.

*  *  *

By the way, despite this being a low-budget movie made by people who've never made a movie before, there's a lot of really good camera shots and angles in it, along with an interesting story, and Bill Loomis is amazingly effective at playing a creepy, dead guy kidnapper and killer.

*  *  *

And just a little note about the jacket of this DVD: this movie has absolutely nothing to do with killer clowns. People who like killer clown movies will be disappointed if they rent this one because it's not about killer clowns, and people who don't like killer clown movies won't rent it because the jacket makes it look like it's about killer clowns. I'm puzzled, but maybe I'm just an easily puzzled guy.",1186704000,10,3573,4.579937304075235
8196161,5,B000QGDIH0,"Mr. Halloween is a must see for the summer. It's a classic horror flick with lots of bodies and blood. It's a great first time film for Director Andy Wolf. With a small budget and a lot of first time actors, it was done amazingly well. All horror fans should check out this movie. It's sure to become a cult classic.",1179360000,6,316,4.19672131147541
