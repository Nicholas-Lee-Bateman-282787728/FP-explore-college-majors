8025824,5,B0002C4IUO,"I know the story.  Knew basically what happens.  Still, the angst and plot complications and story manipulations had me shrieking at my television in the middle of the night.  Volume 8 has the best episodes of the whole series, especially if you're a mad fangirl of Tsukasa's character.  If you are such a fangirl, expect to want to throw things at Tsukushi.  While it is obvious to you and to me that Tsukasa and Tsukushi are meant to be together and that she should be all over him (because that's where I'd be in her place), it is not so clear to our heroine.  But really.  Does every girl go around falling in love with every boy who saves her life?  Of course not.  Only in romance novels, which is why Tsukushi's continued reluctance to view Tsukasa romantically works, however frustrating it may be to those of us who want the instant gratification of a mutual love declaration.

Boys Over Flowers is the ultimate soap opera, though I don't The plot is drawn out and complicated and designed to make you fiend for the next one until your best friend (who happens to be a dreadful otaku himself) shouts at you and tells you to stop being weird.  It's terribly addicting.  If you've heard the complaints floating around about questionable morality and what-have in this series, I find those allegations to be grossly exaggerated.",1124150400,3,1334,4.653846153846154
8025825,5,B0002C4IUO,"I've seen the entire series, both in English and Japanese. I have to say that it is just one big soap opera, but it's one that you never get tired of. I was interested up until the last second of the last episode. This DVD is comprised of episodes that are going to reveal an ever-maturing Tsukasa, a Tsukushi who is growing more aware of him as a love interest, and one serious emotional rollercoaster! Have fun!",1099440000,4,413,4.376623376623376
