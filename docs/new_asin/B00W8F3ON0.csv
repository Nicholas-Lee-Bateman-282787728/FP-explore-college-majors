7126842,4,B00W8F3ON0,season 6 is great but I agree with the other reviews that there is missing episodes such as The Galka Family. Where are the missing episodes and when will they be released on a DVD? Loyal Ghost Adventure fans would like complete seasons when purchasing the DVD's and if there not complete Amazon should tell you on the description that not all episodes are included in this DVD so the buyer is aware that its not a complete season. This is in my opinion an example of bait and switch. I bought season 6 just for the Galka Family episode and was very disappointed when that episode was not on the DVD.,1447804800,7,600,4.366071428571429

The guys go to some pretty scary places, with plenty of back ground history which adds to the interest of the places being investigated. My wife thinks Zak is hot!  So much for being objective!",1434067200,6,407,4.139240506329114
7126870,5,B00W8F3ON0,"Ghost Adventures is known as one of the more authentic ghost hunting shows on television. If you're reading this review, you probably are already interested in the show (if not, check out earlier seasons first). So let's get right into the DVD.

THIS RELEASE
Other reviews discuss this, but for the sake of completion, I'll start out by explaining that this is the 100% official 6th Season release. Travel Channel does not directly make or distribute DVDs; the DVDs are outsourced. The first five seasons were outsourced to a different company, and it seems Amazon has distribution rights for the rest. It is no different from seasons 1-5, except it did not receive a wide release. This is NOT a bootleg or some poor quality video. This is the official release that would be available at any other retailer but for the fact that it is an Amazon Manufactured on Demand (MOD) product.

Amazon's MOD products range in their quality. I personally own quite a few because MOD DVDs tend to cover older series, such as certain Nicktoons from the early-90s. Certain series receive higher quality releases than others. The Amazon MOD DVD for Survivor Season 20 (Heroes vs. Villains) was excellent and it was printed on the mirror-back DVDs rather than purple-back DVD-Rs. This release is on DVD-Rs with printable covers. Personally, I've never had a problem playing any disc from Amazon. Older DVD players may vary, but my DVD player and even my old PS2 played these discs without issue. Your mileage may vary, but honestly for the vast majority of consumers, I'd buy with confidence from Amazon's MOD Create Space.

With that said, something else that is worth noting about this set is there sheer quantity of episodes. There are approximately 26 episodes (another reviewer listed all of the titles). Curiously, they are not all season 6 episodes (season 6 was in fact only 7 episodes depending on how you break them down; Wikipedia lists Season 6 as the group of episodes that aired in the Spring of 2012). These episodes are not in order of air date or anything either; instead, they are just sort of a mix of episodes from 2011 through 2014. Some EXCELLENT episodes are on this set though. The Island of Dolls episode is especially creepy. Calling this ""Season 6"" is a misnomer, but compared to the relatively light episode count of the previous sets, this set (spanning 6 discs) justifies its higher price tag.

VIDEO QUALITY
Ghost Adventures is a difficult show to judge the relative video quality. While the guys use some of the best tech available, in the end of the day you're watching a show with a lot of night vision footage and general darkness. Roughly half of every episode is dark, so to criticize it as grainy or lacking in high fidelity picture quality is to completely miss the point. That said, all of the outdoor stuff and well-lit footage looks excellent. DVD is not, by its nature, an HD format. All the same, this set looks great and there is no appreciable drop in video quality from the transfer.

AUDIO QUALITY
The audio of this set is pretty comparable to the 5 seasons that preceded it. Generally the audio is very good, sometimes something happens while taping the show that causes it to be poor or scrambled. The ambient music and general audio presentation are all excellent under the circumstances.

MENU/DVD FEATURES
As with most Amazon MOD features, the menu is fairly bare-bones and there aren't any bonus features. While a behind the scenes or making of-style documentary might have been nice to have, for those who like to own the episodes on DVD, it isn't a huge detraction from the quality of the release.

SUMMARY
Simply put, if you like Ghost Adventures and you have the other DVD releases, I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up as well. Do not let the fact that this product is a DVD-R scare you away from buying it. It will work (and if it doesn't, Amazon has good customer service) and it will be largely indistinguishable from other releases in this series. Definitely recommended for fans!",1433894400,17,4029,4.755364806866953
