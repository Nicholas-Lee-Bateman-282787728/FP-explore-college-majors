8131996,4,B000GGOJE6,"Actually, I own both the Winter and Summer videos of this series.
I bought the Winter DVD first and was impressed enough to buy the
Summer DVD.

The Winter DVD basically discusses pruning and preparing a vineyard
for winter. However, there is other useful information that is
also addressed. Irrigation, cover crops, etc.

I bought these DVD's because I wanted to start my own ""backyard""
vineyard and I think these DVD's really gave some good pointers on
most of what I needed to know about grapevines.

I do think the price is a bit high, but I'm not sure I could have
gotten this same info without taking an expensive class at the local
college. So its probably a good investment for a beginner.",1200009600,2,697,4.604838709677419
