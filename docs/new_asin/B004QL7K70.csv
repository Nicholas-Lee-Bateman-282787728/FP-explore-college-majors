4445837,5,B004QL7K70,"Project X is great! We loved the movie and are going to purchase it to watch with all our friends. We've watched everything from The Hangover, to The Notebook, to Bag It. This movie is one of our favorites!",1336867200,3,206,4.3076923076923075
4445838,3,B004QL7K70,"""Tonight's about the girls we never had a shot at. Tonight's about changing the game."" When three ""loser"" high school seniors decide to throw the biggest party of the year in order to become more popular they had no idea what they were getting into. Plans and rules go out the window as what starts as a party of no more then 50 begins to escalate quickly. I have been saying that the ""reality"" movies have been used up and are really kind of annoying to watch. While this isn't a total exception this one is at least watchable. On the other hand it is also nothing new. Combine ""American Pie"" with ""Superbad"" and a hand-held camera and you get this movie. This is nothing amazing at all and those other movies were much better, but I have also seen much worse and this one was at least entertaining. Very, very unbelievable but entertaining. I again wonder if I just went to the wrong school because nothing like this was even thought up when I went. Does that make me old?. Overall, nothing original but a watchable teenage party movie. I give it a B.",1336521600,3,1053,4.4051282051282055
4445839,4,B004QL7K70,"Did you spend your entire high school career as someone with few friends who will more than likely be forgotten by the student body moments after graduating? What could you do to change that?

  Thomas (played by Thomas Mann) is turning seventeen and his parents are leaving town. His parents (played by relative unknowns Peter Mackenzie and Caitlin Dullany) fully expect him to throw a party in their absence and simply ask that it be kept under control. Still his friends Costa (played by Oliver Cooper) and JB (played by Jonathan Daniel Brown) believe that they can bring into being an epic gathering that will elevate their friend and themselves to legendary status simply through social networking and word of mouth. Unsure of what to expect, they encounter a former classmate who recently graduated and invite him only to discover he's already planning to attend. And, every step of the way, Kirby (played by Kirby Bliss Blanton) is telling Thomas that Costa's party is a bad idea. Kirby is apparently Thomas's only female friend. Of course Blanton is quite attractive herself and while they've never been more than friends, Thomas entertains numerous fantasies regarding Alexis (another student played by Alexis Knapp) who has no idea he's alive.

  The title is terribly unoriginal, but it was initially intended to be a placeholder until it started to generate interest. Whether that was in any way related to the 1968 science fiction film of the same name or the 1987 comedy-science fiction-thriller starring Matthew Broderick, I can't say. I will say that I and many others in the theater laughed out loud numerous times throughout the film. Some have called this film irresponsible and said it sets a bad example to high school students. Then again, a film that sets a good example would probably depict a party where no alcohol or drugs are consumed, no cigarettes are smoked, and everyone returned home and went to bed at a decent hour after, of course, helping to clean up. Would ANYBODY see that? I wouldn't. It's not revolutionary and there are no profound life lessons but it is unmistakably a good time.",1336521600,3,2122,4.91340782122905
4445840,5,B004QL7K70,Being in my early 40's I haven't been to a party myself for about 15 years. And I suspect the people who didn't like this movie were never in the party crowd anyway. But ask yourself; isn't this really similar to the major-destructive party in John Hughes' SIXTEEN CANDLES? It's just a modern version of that. Does it get a little crude and sexist at times? Yes. But it IS just a movie - not an instructional video. Yes I am aware of the movie copycat parties that resulted in property damages and multiple arrests too. So this film and the arguments for and against it I'm sure will go on for some time. Personally I loved it! The kid in me couldn't help but smirk and laugh out loud. Can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it again. sorry haters. :),1334534400,25,762,4.190476190476191
4445841,1,B004QL7K70,"Love this movie, but I am totally unsatisfied with the quality of the blu ray version...beware  the blu ray version is no better than the cheaper DVD version and the movie completely stopped 5 minutes before the ending.  I guess blu ray no longer means 1080p.",1333584000,3,259,4.608695652173913
4445842,1,B004QL7K70,"I went into this movie based on strong word of mouth about how good it was and I regret spending my time and money on it. It was basically an hour and twenty minutes of unlikeable losers doing a lot of idiotic things and trying to get lucky. The main character named Costa was the most detestable person on the planet, I seriously wanted to dropkick him in the face the entire movie. The only reason why I didn't walk out was because I was hoping that he would get what he deserved in the end. I'd rather watch ""The Devil Inside"" a hundred times over than this piece of **** ever again. Avoid like the plague.",1332288000,14,609,4.213675213675214
4445843,4,B004QL7K70,"The teenage party movie. We've seen it all done before and know exactly where it's headed long before the turns ever take place, right? Reckless teenager is warned by his parents not to have too many friends over, keep the house clean, answer the phone...whatever. Said teen agrees but it's always a lie, and the party ultimately gets way out of hand. That sound about right? These movies tend to have the same message about responsibility and maturing into an adult, making the tough decisions. Nothing wrong with that. John Hughes built a career making films that almost exclusively dealt with those themes.

Project X has no such inclination, and it's all the better for it. In fact, it's almost like the anti-John Hughes film, making the occasional nod to his work while simultaneously blowing it up by glorifying sex, violence, debauchery, wanton destruction, and all in the pursuit of a little extra clout in the high school hallways. Marking the second time this year that the found footage style has been put to masterful use, marking perhaps a game changing year for the genre, the film follows Thomas Kub(Thomas Mann), a Pasadena high school senior who might as well be invisible to the popular kids. He's not overly dorky or nerdy, just amazingly average and testosterone-free. Even his father thinks he lacks spine. When his 17th birthday rolls around, and his parents roll out of town to celebrate their conveniently timed anniversary, Thomas is explicitly told not to have too many friends over. Yeah....that's not going to happen.

With the frenzied assistance of his Guido belt buddy, Costa(Oliver Cooper), who just wants to get laid like he supposedly used to back home, a party is quickly put together. But Costa is a little too good at his job, and in his efforts to ensure a party that will change their social lives forever, he unwittingly invites thousands to show up at Thomas' doorstep, creating a clusterbomb of epic proportions. We're talking a party that makes Weird Science and Can't Hardly Wait look like Sunday school.

Along with their overweight buddy, JB(Jonathan Daniel Brown), Thomas and Costa make every conceivable wrong decision during the course of the night, but it only serves to make the party bigger and more out of control. As the crowd swells into the thousands, the family dog is terrorized beyond belief, midgets turn up out of nowhere to be thrown into ovens, and bursting garden gnomes release literal treats of ecstasy. Authority figures get the proverbial and literal middle finger all night long, including the angry neighbor across the street, who isn't taking kindly to the sound of naked girls diving into the pool or the booming bass cranked out by twin DJs on the wheels of steel. Oh, and the neighborhood starts to bear a striking resemblance to a war zone. Mere words can't describe just how insane this party gets. The word ""party"" needs to be redefined. Even the cop are helpless against the out of control rager, stymied by a combination of Costa's legal expertise and by a barrage of incoming fire. Perhaps ""war zone"" is even too mild to describe it.  Whatever the word, there has never been an experience quite like this on the silver screen in quite some time.

That's really what Project X is and has always had aspirations to be: a never before seen movie going experience. Piecing this monstrosity together would have been impossible if not for the perfect combination of people behind the camera, starting with producer Todd Phillips. The thread of anarchistic wish fulfillment is one he seems to have a particular fondness for, seen in both Old School and The Hangover. Debuting director Nima Nourizadeh, a music video veteran, puts that experience to perfect use in some of the film's most stirring stretches of just watching the crowd in their state of euphoria, without a care in the world. The script, which bears a little too much of a resemblance to Superbad at times, was written by Matt Drake and Michael Bacall. Bacall is having a phenomenal couple of years exploring the crazy ways in which young people think, having also written Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and the upcoming 21 Jump Street remake. An oft forgotten subplot involving Thomas and his hot best friend, Kirby(Kirby Bliss Blanton), is the one aspect that is so cliche as to be distracting.

The goal of any party movie is to put the viewer right into the thick of the mob, to experience the mayhem first hand. Few films ever actually accomplish it, because the most epic parties are a collection of perfectly aligned intangibles. A movie has to find a way to capture those things and do it in an organic way. The music, the people, the energy, just the right amount of rebellion and fear of what could happen next. Project X, for all the unbelievable antics, makes for an incredibly authentic and unforgettable experience. Too bad the high school parties in my day weren't this awesome.",1332288000,7,4928,4.839857651245552
4445844,1,B004QL7K70,"It's Thomas' (Thomas Mann) 18th birthday and his friend Costa (Oliver Cooper) has plans to throw him the biggest party ever. With his parents going out of town for their anniversary, Thomas has the house to himself. Thomas just wants a small get-together or ""enough to be cool"" as he puts it. However Costa wants this to be a party everyone remembers, one that everyone will be talking about long after it's over, and one that will change the lives of Thomas, Costa, and their friend JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown) forever. Not to mention the three of them finally getting laid. Chronicling the entire spectacle with his camera is a weird kid from school named Dax (Dax Flame). With his sights set on nothing but a sea of women and the most epic night he and his friends could possibly ever have, Project X is what Costa labels this little filming event.

A documentary-style party movie isn't exactly something that anyone should be excited about. A found-footage The Hangover is all this feels like going into it and Todd Phillips producing doesn't really help change that opinion. The end result is mostly exactly what trailers let on with a conclusion that is extremely predictable with few surprises in between.

Stupid high school humor and crude and raunchy jokes are what bridge the gap between first being introduced the characters and the party actually happening. Its immaturity practically becomes overbearing as the comedy will mostly just make people outside the high school demographic feel older than they really are. The biggest surprise comes in the form of a drug dealer named T-Rick (Rick Shapiro). This is where the mascot for the movie comes in and T-Rick's pursuit of retrieving that mascot is perhaps the only original aspect of the movie. The line about him being like The Terminator is the funniest line to come out of Project X. Nick Nervies and Alexis Knapp play Tyler and Everett who are hired as security for the party. Tyler has this big bouncer like attitude and is this teeny tiny little kid while Everett takes his job a little too seriously. These two, T-Rick, along with the quick montage of Milo the dog being in a bouncy castle and getting into crazy antics during the party are the closest things to highlights the movie has to offer.

With that said, nearly everything else plays out exactly as you expect it to. Losers try to throw a party to change their reputation, that party finally taking place and being even bigger than they imagined, and eventually said party getting out of control. There are so many instances in the movie where an entire song will play while we're shown various shots of this crazy party and Thomas and his friends enjoying themselves. If anything ever felt like an extended music video before it was outdone by Project X. There's barely a story here. Filming an out of control party doesn't make it a movie. Calling it a movie feels disrespectful to anything that came before it.

There is one small shred of depth Project X offers and it lies within that one party changing everything mindset. It's as if it offers this sense of accomplishment while doing something nobody thought you were capable of. Changing your life with the events that transpire in one night is something that probably seems strangely liberating, but this could also be viewed as the movie encouraging this type of behavior which is just as idiotic as the premise of the movie itself.

Project X feels like the combination of Superbad and The Hangover shot in the same style you saw in Chronicle, but doesn't come anywhere close to being as good or even as decent as any of those movies. Many people claimed to be surprised by Project X afterwards and that it was more or better than they thought it would be. The studio rep told me he found the movie somewhat inspiring. Unfortunately Project X inspired me to do nothing more than see something that's actually worthwhile.",1330646400,10,3913,4.748529411764705

This kind of party crazy movie earns around $54,724,272 (USA) in 2012 means a lot, I mean a lot you know. And it was rated 6.7/10 from imdb. It usually have like 5.0/10 this kind of crazy party movie. And this movie almost have 7 stars.
And for me? I give it a solid 7.5/10.
It really made my heart beat and at the end I almost give my two thumbs way way up!!

The drector Nima Nourizadeh Iranian guy later makes the legendary movie AMERICAN ULTRA as well. He rocks! He knows how to make movies !

This is not just a cheap let's go crazy party teenage movie.
It's bigger then DIE HARD. It's extreme then HANG OVER 1-3 all together, I mean combibing all 3 movies cannot beat this single film. I really mean it. If you see you will agree to me wholeheartedly at once.

Two highschool friend throwing a party in an empty house of the parent's bacome a major caos I mean A war, A major news of the California. A phenomenon,  teenage rebellion, kick ass, epic you name it.
They first thought that maybe hundreds will come. It ended with maybe 3000-400 of them came. And they made a crazy party. They were naked taking drugs dancing, swimming half naked, drinking, with DZ playing hip-hop/ rock,  jumping off the roof top from the wire, Drive the Mercedes into the pool.
Some 17, some over 20 but barely most of them teens. They are mixed up with all beauty team. No one ugly. They are all super model like and they are all good looking. They just wants some party.

So what is this so hillarious?
There is no future.
There is no consequences.
There is no cops worried about.
When the boy who lives in this house finally have extacy for the first time, he just doesn't have worry about the house half cracked any more. In 2 days his parents are coming back but he doesn't give a damn anymore.
He just think about the girl he love for some time. He just want some enjoyment.
See, he was berely seen to his friends in public and now there are 3000-4000 people in the house just for his 17th birthday celebreation!!

Later the hellicopter comes and the neighbor is in the news.
The parents call. They are about to come back. They are scared to death of what's going on.
The crazy guy is setting the fire on the house yard and the house for the revenge taking a doll like thing from his house.
The people are really crazy on the street in front of the house not interested in cops car warning about going back home all of them.
They even throw things at the police cars.
It's MUTINY against teens!
It's a warning from the youngster man!
At the end the whole house was totally burnt.
In the morning the father sees the house not exist and he just tells the son, the money for your college education just gone son.
By the way how was the party, how many of them were?
Maybe 4000 even more? It was hell of a party father.

A majority of the shots are just 5 minute intervals of partying to distract you from the fact that he should have banged the hotter chick.

4446154,1,B004QL7K70,"High School party themed film made strictly for teens. Surprising how rarely funny the dialogue is, far too much ""Duuuuude, you're crazy!"" and ""Woohoo!"" back and forths. And it may be nitpicky and irrelevant to point out, but I'd assume most of us have been to at least one party that got out of hand, and the logic is dead wrong on this one. The party reaches ""epic"" 500+ people size without the three teen boys having provided any alcohol or drugs themselves, it's all BYO supply. Towards the latter end of the party a stash of Extasy is discovered, but by then the party is several hours old and encompassing an entire neighborhood block. As afterwork escapism I don't mind in the least tired plot devices like mom-and-dad-leave-wallflower-son-home-alone,-except... etc., but if you're going to subject your audience as well to hand held cinema verite schtick for 90 minutes, at least work to make the big effect (party size) plausible. You're likely come away from this film assuming 15 year old boys were consulted on story ideas.",1446422400,,1035,4.853107344632768

It was the biggest party bust in the history of his home town! No fires, nobody was hurt... but a ""friend"" invited, apparently, the entire state population... and they came! It wasn't funny at the time, but it is a story we'll tell forever. The worst part was a mystery stain on the rug! :) Ahhh, social media!",1440028800,4,479,4.333333333333333

My initial impressions of this were based on Amazon reviews and Alexis Knapp's role in Pitch Perfect.  On a whim, I made the purchase.  I won't be doing that again.

The movie, as discussed in several reviews - follows the typical pathway of a house party that got out of control.  It advances in a hap-hazard method and ends the same way most coming of age movies from the mid/late 80's do.  I was able to relate to the party mentality early on, but the novelty quickly wore off as the movie dragged on.  I had become numb to it and largely bored 1/3 of the way into the movie.  I'd sell it, but I'm hesitant to ask someone to pay for it.",1405382400,,678,4.2015503875969

I am usually a firm believer in ""different strokes for different folks"" when it comes to liking movies, but this? It was hateful, sociopathic behavior being rewarded on nearly every level and being glorified in a lazy, spiteful movie with little to no sense of scale, and absolutely no self awareness.

""Project X"" is a series of set pieces ripped off from one news story and about a hundred inexpressibly superior ""coming of age"" and ""party"" films from the last 4 decades. This movie directly steals from those other films by rote, but has no idea what the source material means. At least in those other movies there was a sense that the characters had reasons for their actions on some basic level or had grown as characters, if only minimally, by the end of the film. There were story arcs and plots. This just goes from one idiotic glorification of excess to the next without giving us a reason to care how it fits in with the overall story. Probably because there was no real story or plot. No one learns anything. No one grows. Nothing really happens even though literally everything was shoved onto the screen. Even the father of the main character practically pats him on the back for doing what probably amounts to millions in property damage and for committing local, state, and federal crimes because even the adults seem to think ""popularity at any price"" is a justifiable end in itself.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

 Every year just about, a movie comes out of nowhere, that is actually quite clever and funny. Three teenagers, Thomas, Costa and JB, plan a humongous birthday party for Thomas, at his parents' home, after they split for the weekend. Before the parents leave, Thomas reassures his father that he'll keep the house in good order as there will be only a few kids coming over to celebrate his birthday.

We learn that Thomas' father is disappointed in his son in general, as he's not very popular at school. In contrast to the hesitant Thomas, Costa is the bad-ass friend whose main goal is to get laid. As he says later on, ""Tonight is about the girls we never had a shot at"" and the party is the opportunity to ""change the game."" Costa continually eggs his conservative friend on, urging him at every turn to embrace his inner wild side. Rounding out the trio, is their nerdy, overweight kid, JB, who also seeks sexual freedom.

A fourth confederate, Dax, an AV student, follows Thomas, Costa and JB around, videotaping all the events with a hand-held camera. Other footage is shot during the film with smart phones, police dashboard cameras as well as by the news media, which plays a prominent role during the film's climax.

Before the break into the Second Act, when the big party begins, there's some important foreshadowing going on. The three friends pay a visit to Costa's marijuana dealer, T-rick, a military vet, who sells them some weed for the party. Costa ends up stealing a Santa Claus gnome, a figurine that later is revealed to contain hundreds of pills of Ecstasy. The theft of the gnome sets T-Rick off later on, with near deadly consequences. At this juncture, T-Rick is seen chasing the hapless trio, as they make a getaway in Thomas' father's car; the vet manages to break the car window, foreshadowing some real crazy things to come.

Since the three friends want to achieve popularity amongst their peers, they advertise their big event on social media, with disastrous consequences. Before they know it, about fifteen hundred to two thousand teenagers populate Thomas' backyard (soon the orgy spills into the house itself, earlier proclaimed off limits by Thomas' father).

The three must then cope with an escalating series of crises which all have unexpected results. An initial crisis involves Thomas' pet pooch, who the drunken revelers hoist into the air, tethered to a bunch of helium balloons. Thomas lowers his dog down from the air and averts the first crisis. Then a neighbor comes by and threatens to call the police because of the noise. One of Costa's very young 'security guards', tasers a neighbor 'who doth protest too much' and then ends up getting slugged himself by the angry protester. In another great twist (and there are many of them here) Costa averts another crisis by threatening to report the neighbor for slugging his 'security' (a minor).

As teenage girls strip off their blouses and bras and swim nude in the swimming pool, Thomas is tested by Alexis, 'the hottest girl' in the high school, as she French kisses him as they both down shots of Tequila (the seduction foreshadows the discovery later on by Thomas' girlfriend Kirby, of Thomas about to have sex with Alexis).

When the police arrive, Thomas and his friends manage to get everyone to quiet down in the backyard. The police want to search around but Costa smartly reminds them they have no warrant. Later, Thomas is depressed by the wanton destruction going on outside and Costa tries to relax him by giving him an Ecstasy pill, recovered from T-Rick's (now shattered) gnome.

Now completely high, Thomas is hardly in a position to try and keep things under control. His ego is stroked when all the party goers sing happy birthday to him. Meanwhile events are set in motion, leading to things getting totally out of control. A dwarf is thrown into a dryer and after Costa saves him, he repays everyone by striking them hard in the testicles. Later the dwarf returns and promptly drives Thomas' father's car into the swimming pool in the backyard.

The second act crisis reaches its apex when T-Rick appears with a flamethrower, torching Thomas' parents' house and the rest of the neighborhood. For a few minutes, the comic tone of the movie is lost and I'm not convinced that the flamethrower scenes with all the kids running for their lives and police firing rubber bullets, enhanced the overall spectacle. In other words, it got a little 'too real'. Nonetheless, the way in which the news media is depicted covering the event, was a nice satiric touch.

'Project X' manages to re-introduce the comic tone when Thomas' father both berates and praises him for the riotous goings-on the night before. Besides lamenting how much all this is going to cost him to repair, the father also is impressed that Thomas has made himself popular. In a great touch, the father makes Thomas drive to school in the burnt out mini-van. But Thomas finds redemption from both his schoolmates who cheer him in the hallway and Kirby, who forgives him for his indiscretion with Alexis.

Finally, we find out that the legal consequences for the hapless trio are not so bad after all. And the party becomes fodder for even Jimmy Kimmel, who jokes about it on nighttime network TV.

'Project X' is successful because all of its unexpected twists and turns. It's a clever concept which manages to sustain itself until the end, when it slightly wears out its welcome. The three principal actors were discovered after a nationwide casting call. Since they didn't know each other before, the producers brilliantly sent them on a week Disney vacation, where they presumably bonded. Teenagers will love 'Project X' and adults with open minds, will too.",1373846400,,5803,4.818090452261306

4446557,3,B004QL7K70,"It's kind of like `Superbad' meets `Cloverfield', this high octane teen party film is laced with redundancy and offers up a moral that feels extremely falsified and yet it is extremely entertaining, which is all it ever really tries to be.  With the clichd shaky cam in toe and a slew of wannabe actors who have no qualms with taking off their tops and romping around with booze in hand, `Project X' promises the audience a sweaty good time, and for all intents and purposes, that is what we get.  Sadly, there is a lot of redundancy to be found here.  The party scenes (or scene since it lasts the entirety of the movie) has a lot of similar shots, and while havoc ensues to varying degrees, and the end is just a mind blow of crazy, I found myself wanting to hit fast-forward through many parts of the movie.

The film circles around a birthday party for Thomas (who is turning 17) at his home by him and his buddies while Thomas's parents are out of town.  The party is an attempt by Thomas's friend Costa to be popular.  Things get way out of hand, Thomas's parents' house gets destroyed, the neighbors call the cops, a midget punches a bunch of people in the nether regions and some crazed lunatic burn's Thomas's house down.  In the meantime, a lot of booze is drunk, loud rap music pumps through your home stereo system and tops galore are tossed to the wayside.

The cast is a whos who of nobody you've ever heard of before (aside from Miles Teller who is here briefly), but it doesn't matter.  They don't have to do anything of substance.  They just drink and dance and cheer.  The end result is a bit of a mess.  I like how the film practically turns itself into a horror movie but the idea projected that this party was a GOOD idea in the long run is a shame and kind of proves that mindless entertainment like this really has no reason to be made.

That said, I semi-enjoyed myself.",1372032000,2,1894,4.361823361823362

The acting is beyond horrible to describe the annoying characters for this movie including all the wild antics portrayed which by the way is a bit over the top.

Parents are out of town, time to call the crew and PARTY!! Right? I'm no exception to that one, but there is something seriously wrong with our society and the younger generation today. Completely amoral, without any self worth or character. The only thing these morons respect is money no matter how it is acquired. What's scarier is one of these A Holes will be running this country some day...hopefully I'll be long gone by then!

V: 1080p 16:9. I was skeptical before viewing due to it being a hand-held film, assuming that set use didn't involve any form of external lighting. I was correct as 90% of the film is all 'natural'. The night scenes had high ISO with little noise present, however it felt as it 90% of the movie was 720p, not the full 1080 as Blu-Ray promises. I will blame this on the transfer, not the film itself, due to having the theatrical and extended releases both on 1 disc, thus having to compress the video to save size. With that said, the film had GREAT COLORIZATION. Perfect use of its red's, blue's, and superb skin tone. 3 stars.

A: DTS 5.1 compressed audio. My receiver read at 50KHZ, rather than the full 96KHZ of lossless. Great use of rear surrounds with little directional or discreet use, but the surrounds really engulfed you into movie. It wasn't special, but it was effective and made the movie fun. The LFE channel got real workout as my SUB was bangin' throughout. Perfect lows as it made up for the so-so treble compressed. Kid Cudi's 'Pursuit of Happiness' is a home theater demo as the party sounds play from the surrounds with front sound stage playing the song. FUN. 4 stars.",1368057600,,1424,5.245614035087719

4446580,3,B004QL7K70,"Hey, we've all been to wild parties, and we've all been to wild parties gone. . .well, wild.  Puke on the carpet.  Broken lamps, vases, chandeliers.  Maybe a busted window (or two).  A little streaking; a lot of sex.  Definite intoxication.  And waking up the next morning (or afternoon), looking around through bloodshot eyes, and thinking, ""I am so dead!""

But when it comes to the carnage, chaos, and mayhem on rowdy display in PROJECT X, all of the above sounds like a church social.  When three nerds (Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown) decide it's time for them to be ""cool for their school"" they use all of the social technology at their disposal (and there's a ton of it these days) to invite Youth to come over to celebrate Thomas's 17th birthday--to christen a weekend when the lad's parents are out of town.  And of course the event rapidly spirals out of control, from topless girls jumping in the pool, to an auto going in the pool, to a midget being locked in the oven, to a drunken sot literally swinging from the second story chandelier, to a flame-throwing drug dealer deprived of his Ecstasy, to an epic confrontation with police in riot gear.  Predictably the news helicopter arrives in the knick of time for viewers to look in as the house--along with a good portion of the neighborhood--goes up in flames.

And of course, there are no real consequences, and in fact it turns out Dad (Peter Mackenzie) is just a little envious, culminating with young Thomas ultimately winning back his girl (Kirby Bliss Blanton).  Oh, and Oliver Cooper easily wins the prize for most annoying, irritating teen in cinematic histoire.  But PROJECT X is not about life's lessons. . .unless it's how to tear up stuff.

4446701,5,B004QL7K70,"Project X is not a 5-star movie.  I'm sorry for giving it the highest rating a product can receive on amazon.  However, let me explain my case so you don't think there's something wrong with me.  I've seen *countless* teen party movies over the years and NONE of them are entertaining at all.  They are nothing more than filler and a waste of movie space.

Project X... FINALLY, a party movie that actually lives up to the hype!  These teens are on a mission to create the absolute biggest, baddest party ever designed.  They of course, are interested in sex, being cool and just being really rowdy, however what happens is that this party eventually spins *completely* out of control.  As the movie rolls along, you will probably be sitting there totally amazed at just how many creative ways this party turns into pure insanity.

Seriously, you will never want to see another party film involving teenagers ever again because this one set out to accomplish every single nook and cranny you can possibly provide and make it MUCH better than all the rest.  It makes all the rest no longer relevant, in fact.  It really works.  I don't even want to spoil any of the ways these teens get into trouble and what they do.  They go from the uncoolest kids in school to the coolest in one night, that's for sure.  Alright alright, I'll spoil one moment.  While the one teen is talking to his father upstairs on the phone and assuring his father that everything's alright at home and that he's not causing any trouble whatsoever, a huge explosion occurs right outside the window!

It's hilarious because the entire time I was wondering how the kids would clean up by morning so their parents wouldn't find out what happened.  None of that even matters and you'll find out why, haha.

It's rowdy, offensive, provides plenty of swearing and nudity, and it's completely inappropriate for children.  However, for one 80-minute movie and a night of adrenaline-pumping fun, I recommend purchasing (or renting, if you understandably don't trust my words) what will forever be, the king of party films.",1354320000,19,2086,4.7444444444444445

4446755,2,B004QL7K70,"The film starts off by informing the viewer that the events in the film are fictional and that all the stunts are performed by actors, but by the end of it you're likely to forget about that. Especially since they added the little ""after-bio"" right before the credits started. When that popped up my first thought was ""was this based off something that really happened? o. O"" Then my brain turned on again and I remembered the warning at the beginning.

This film is labeled as a comedy, but I don't see how. There wasn't anything comedic about it. It was just a party gone very, very wrong. That's really all this movie is, it's a party film. There's a lot of scene's where you just see the party going on and they have music playing. Maybe it's because I'm not a party person, but the entire movie felt very lifeless. This is the third movie in a week that I've seen that had a lot of potential, but they didn't capitalize on it.

It's filmed as if it were a home movie, with Dax Flame ""filming"" it the entire time. Me personally, I would've liked to see more of Dax. It took me a while to remember what I saw him in, but for those of you still having trouble he was in 21 Jump Street. His character seemed to be the one I liked best, even though he only had a total of like 5 lines.

Throughout the movie you see a lot of drinking, dancing, topless women, and Thomas, the guy throwing the party, freaking out. What I don't get is why do they always have these movies where the outcasted kid throws the party and he winds up being paranoid the entire time? We all know that kind of thing never happens. It's always the ""popular"" people that throw the party. Granted, his paranoia soon became reality as the party escalated and turned into a small riot.

By the end of it nothing really stuck with me. There were a few things here and there like Thomas jumping off of the roof or the kid getting punched by the neighbor, but other than that it isn't very memorable. What this film does do well is make you feel like you're actually there. By doing so watching this is kind of like an adrenaline rush, but sadly that's the only strong thing about the movie.

Overall Score: 4/10 - After watching this my reaction was ""meh.""

4446760,4,B004QL7K70,"For those who've written bad reviews stating this film had no redeeming value or in no way left you feeling educated or as if you had learned something...well, you're absolutely right; however, there is one problem with that notion...IT WASN'T MEANT TO!  The trailers and advertisements for this film stated it was about a high school party that turned epic, then got out of control.  This movie delivered on every level what it promised.  I didn't walk away feeling I had learned how to cope with life better or osmotically learned a new level of responsibility.  Instead, I remembered (and felt!) exactly what it was like oh-so-many years ago in high school...especially senior year.

This movie was an extended metaphor of my life senior year.  I WAS the main character.  I could not believe the similarities!  I, too, was an invisible kid until that Friday night when a few of my friends made me throw a party after my parents had gone out of town for the weekend.  I, too, wanted only 10 or 15 people.  I didn't end up with 1500, but I think about 60-70 seems about right.  In a respected neighborhood with nose-over-the-fences neighbors, I had people puking in the front and back yards.  Christmas ornaments and cups of Screwdrivers being sucked up by a nozzled-vacuum cleaner.  Potted plants being thrown inside my house.  My dog was stoned and ate half the dish of peanut butter balls we had given up on.  PJ cups strewn all over the place (as well as people - and clothes - for that matter).  Strip Pool, strip poker, Beer Pong, Naked Jell-O Twister (I copy-writed that...don't steal it Mattel or whomever), and Insane Rules Mortal Kombat.  I also hooked up with a girl I previously had been too shy and worthless to try for.  I was even run over by a car (somehow was not injured)!

But God it was seemingly the greatest (or most fun) night of my life back then.  I had people coming up to me I didn't know and had never seen saying how great a time they had, and people shouting ""Killer party dude!""  Luckily, though, I had a couple days to clean and some true friends to help me do so and somehow we pulled it off masterfully.  But the point is this:  this film allowed me to go back and recapture all of that.  It helped me forget about my present obstacles for the time being.  I don't feel there is anything wrong with that when, of course, taken into perspective.  If anyone were to say, ""Well this movie's going to make teenage Johnny go and try to throw the same party..."" wrong...he was already planning it.  In fact, this may have helped him avoid a few mistakes, broken laws, and injuries, even.  So maybe it did have some ""redeeming value.""  But if not, it had qualitative value in that it took spending only a few bucks and giving up an hour or so of my time to let me feel that night again...and I thank this movie very much for that!",1349654400,21,2858,4.463320463320463

4446763,1,B004QL7K70,"The thrill of throwing an epic party for your high school friends - and then some - cannot be overstated and is a defining moment of one's adolescence.  As a youth of somewhat reasonable intelligence I always made sure the parties I helped coordinate were at a friend's house - never my own.  I remember quite fondly one such event my junior year I helped put together that almost ended without a single mishap, until one of the last partygoers drunkenly punched a hole through my friend's living room wall as he was stumbling out the door.  Needless to say my friend's parents weren't thrilled when they came home the next day and weren't fooled by the repositioned portrait over the gaping hole.

So here we have ""Project X,"" a comedy by Nima Nourizadeh of the found-footage variety that reminds us that if you crowd a house with a bunch of unsupervised high school kids a lot of bad things are going to happen.

Parties are risky but if done right can do wonders for your social credibility.  Enter Thomas (Thomas Mann), Costa (Oliver Cooper) and J.B (Jonathan Daniel), three friends looking to boost their popularity and score with a bunch of hot chicks.  It's Thomas' birthday and it just so happens to coincide with his parents' anniversary.  When they plan to leave for the weekend allowing Thomas and a few of his friends to enjoy the house, Costa comes up with the brilliant idea to throw the Greatest Party Eva'.

If you've seen the trailers or MTV spots you know what happens.  A large gathering quickly spins out of control as more than a thousand people converge on small house vibrating to the beats of the party's DJ.  All of this is shown through the digital lens of a hired cameraman because for some reason they want to capture their criminal exploits - which include buying drugs and getting completely wasted - on camera.

Under it all ""Project X"" is an ugly, mean spirited film.  The main characters were clearly inspired by the trio from the much superior film - and that's saying a lot - ""Superbad.""  But unlike those social outcasts there is nothing likable about these miscreants.  Thomas could be sensible as the skinny shy kid but only acts for his own self-interests.  Costa impersonates Jonah Hill's Seth from the aforementioned film but without the humor or insightful angst.  He's just mean and gets off on insulting others, especially J.B. for his portliness.  And J.B. is just your nice, overweight geek looking for a little companionship.

The movie is overtly misogynistic as most of the female characters are shown exclusively from the neck-down, whether grinding on the dance floor or swimming topless in the pool, and in one example a girl exposes her thong while ascending a staircase in slow-motion.  I hope that cameraman was well-compensated for his voyeurism.  When the film isn't reducing women to body parts, it's showcasing a midget getting stuffed into an oven, a dog being carried away by helium balloons, and anyone with a shred of intelligence unfortunate enough to be near the party getting tazed in the neck.  None of this - and this is the important part - is the least bit funny or entertaining.

While this visual abomination is complimented by an excellent soundtrack of pulsing techno and hip-hop, it doesn't stave off the boredom that sets in long before the SWAT team and guy with a flamethrower arrive.  Besides, if I wanted to watch a 90-minute music video I'd waste my time on YouTube instead of this pseudo-porn.

The most aggravating thing about ""Project X"" is how the action is completely devoid of consequences.  Kids get hammered on booze, slam ecstasy like it's candy, vomit uncontrollably and vandalize property with no payoff.  No one learns anything.  There is no purpose.

The last straw for me was how this supposedly unconventional film with its low-budget indie vibe titled ""Prjoect X"" relies all-too heavily on the tired cliche of the main character - as flawed an unlikeable as he is - getting the incredibly hot girl.  In this case we have Kirby (Kirby Blanton), one of the few females allowed to show her face and I believe the only female allowed to speak.  She walks in on Thomas as he's in the process of getting laid by another girl in an upstairs bedroom.  She understandably walks out in disgust and promptly ends their relationship.  Thomas realizes how badly he messed things up, so much so that not even his weak speech at the end of the movie will be able to win her back.  Oh wait...

I once watched a kid punch a hole through my friend's wall for no reason.  At least we learned something that night and appreciated the experience of throwing party we probably shouldn't have.  The characters in this film learned nothing and became worse for it.  Hopefully that's not the case for all the kids who were inspired by it to throw their own debacles.",1348617600,4,4838,4.71547619047619

The plot is almost non-existant, other than the continual quest to ""finger bang"" a chick, and to throw a large party to become popular, there really is no plot.

4446782,3,B004QL7K70,"The concept for this movie is great, but the execution is terrible. The idea to go with the handheld el cheapo looking Blair Witch Project ripoff video style was dumb. It's a movie! Spring for some film stock so at least it could be watchable.

The other problem is the script. There are virtually no laughs in it at all. The only scene that got me chuckling was when (many SPOILER ALERTS ahead) the drug dealer shows up and starts flamethrowing the neighborhood. That was so out of the blue and then when the cops show up it gets at least good from the aspect of watching disaster porn.

The main problem with this movie, despite the fairly likable trio of high school kids who ""run"" the party, is not only does the dialogue between them seem written by a complete idiot who thinks teenagers talk that way now, but the outrageous stuff just seems so lame when you cut right to the core of the stunts. Get this: There are two live DJs playing the party and not a single memorable song. Was there no budget to spring for some decent electronic tunes and not this mush they came up with? Go have a listen to the soundtrack from Go to get an idea how how to blend cool house sounds with an off-the-wall plot.

Kid jumps off roof. Been done before. Remember Almost Famous?
Car drives into pool. Seriously? Oh, we've never seen that in a movie before.
A midget? A lone midget shows up and proceeds to punch kids in the nuts. Sorry, Mini Me was funnier in the Austin Powers series.
Teenage girls go topless in the backyard pool...and that's it. They just splash around in the pool. It's like voyeur porn for 12-year-olds.
Don't even get me started on the clips of people dancing which basically consist of let's see some chick do a booty grind against some boy for two seconds. Ooh, cutting edge.
Oh, yeah, some old dude with an '80s 'stache shows up to party demonstrating his beer pong skills. Snooze and fest!

You get the picture. Incredibly uncreative when you look back at the various party movies from Risky Business through Sixteen Candles to Dazed And Confused ....even such B level flicks as Can't Hardly Wait are better. Then the movie falls back into the typical Hollywood boy likes girl, girl likes boy, boy screws up, girl tells him to hit the road, boy wins her heart in the end. Really? This epic party wasn't enough. Had to fall back on the tried and true high school love story plot point?

The best scenes are at the end where you get clips of Jimmy Kimmel or local LA news morning show anchors talking about what happened as if the party was ""real."" Now those were actually funny.",1346889600,,2594,4.4411764705882355

Certainly none of this would likely happen, certainly not on this scale.  I'm reminded of the 1983 Tom Cruise classic, ""Risky Business"" except that movie actually had a purpose, a story and some likeable characters.  Like this film RB featured a party, an expensive car in the water and a pair of potential love birds.

In Project X, high school student Thomas (Thomas Mann) an otherwise sober kid is convinced to have a party at his house on his birthday while his parents are conveniently out of town for the week-end.  His best friends Costa (Oliver Cooper) and Miles (Miles Teller) invite everyone they know and thousands they don't thanks to the internet.  The whole thing is filmed by another friend (Dax Flame) in yet another take on the ""found footage"" theme.  Actually I thought that worked pretty well for a change.  The camera guy actually didn't have to run for his life while remaining committed to keep on filming.  Here he didn't want to miss a stray boob.

By boob I mean the fleshy, perfectly formed ones that are attached to nubile young ladies.  On that front there is no shortage.  The party devolves into one giant booze fest with what appears to be indifferent neighbors but for one and a seemingly powerless, ineffective Pasadena police force.  I guess the filmmakers hit their target and I suspect plenty of Blu ray players will have worn out pause buttons as a result.  Me?  I'll take ""Risky Business.""",1346457600,,1558,4.672794117647059

4446855,2,B004QL7K70,"PROJECT X is about ""the most epic house party of all time."" Thrown as a birthday celebration by three unpopular high school boys, the party escalates rapidly until it hits unimaginable, chaotic heights. There really is no plot at all, unless you count a very predictable, very cliched love story that only pops up to give the lunacy some semblance of story.

Whether or not you like the film will depend on just a few factors. Roughly half of the film is nothing more than music video montages of teens going wild, many of them in various stages of undress. If you don't count the opener and closer of the film, the end result is basically an MTV version of a softcore, barely legal porno. If that sounds like your bag, then buckle up. Be warned, though. This film has plenty of bodily fluids, but most of them aren't the result of pleasure, although viewers are treated to more than one shot of boys and girls emptying their bladders, which I guess satisfies the lusts of some people.

The movie is really nothing more than an exercise in lust. The largest party I've ever been to was the Full Moon Party in Thailand; it was massive, chaotic, and there was a tent filled with injured and comatose people, but that still paled in comparison to this shindig. I only mention it here because I get the sense of wish-fulfillment that the producers of the film were appealing to in their younger viewers (if you don't count the last fifteen minutes of the party, when things literally and metaphorically go up in flames). Much like a real porno, the movie wants to submerse audiences in the environment and nothing more (hence it is portrayed as yet another found footage film), providing the experience of actually being there among the unaccountably huge ratio of gorgeous boys and girls doing everything but full frontal. As a thirty-something with most of his partying days comfortably behind him, though I found the whole thing monotonous and tiresome. Without a story to propel it, without interesting or unique characters (Costa, the sidekick responsible for the whole mess, is an unapologetically awful person and he becomes ever harder to stomach as the film progresses), and without any sense of direction or unity, this is less a movie than it is a visually arresting mess. Viewers hungry enough to be a part of its riotous energy -- those who dream of similar parties in their future -- they might be drawn in. However, those with more mature aspirations will probably find themselves quickly as sick of the whole thing as the hundreds of kids who, at the conclusion, are themselves puking all over the place.",1343952000,2,2616,4.722100656455142

It wouldn't surprise me to see this in the $1 bin very soon, and even then, it's overpriced.",1343606400,8,496,4.9879518072289155

4446862,1,B004QL7K70,"Dumb, noncreative stereotypes, no story, no acting, no nothing (double negative?). However, if you're an insecure rejected teen this will continue your fantasy stardom and provide the slapstick humor you never grew out of. The usual studio teen themes of alcohol, drugs, hot tubs (or pool), a few boobs and pretend sex, trashing - it's all comic book there.

Four/five star reviewers came from the aforementioned demographic.
Three star reviewers safely indecisive.

Kudos to the studio & producers for the latest tactic to squeeze more blood (money) to not include Special Features unless you pay extra.
Kudos to the studio & producers for the unimaginative copycatting of the too often used and cheap actor with handheld camera documenting vehicle.",1343001600,6,750,5.294117647058823

4446919,5,B004QL7K70,This movie was amazing especially if you can relate. If you cant or you don't have a crazy party side to you u won't enjoy it. This movie is a sit down and watch every detail from beginning to end to get the full effect. This movie had me going crazy for a week about it and I would recommend it to everybody.

4446921,2,B004QL7K70,This movie failed to live up to all the hype and its delivery was sloppy. I knew what was coming as soon as the plot was laid out.  It was a far cry from the very humorous & iconic American Pies and Scary Movies I grew up with. This movie tried and failed.,1341532800,3,256,3.830188679245283

4446945,3,B004QL7K70,"Is it any good?

Behold my reaction to the first scene of Project X: `Geez, not another one!' Seriously, for last few weeks we've only had reviews for movies with `found footage'. As much as I'm starting really, REALLY despise the technique, it was actually used in a quite well, in that it was used in an exciting way, and somewhat believable that someone could be filming a party. The movie only features no name actors and they do a decent job, however, for me, the star of the film is the editing and the soundtrack. It made you feel like you were there experiencing the sights and sounds of the party (whether you find it pleasant or not). The ending, and in particular, the moral or message of the film was downright atrocious, but if you overlook that and are looking for a laugh, then this might appease you, cause just when you think it couldn't get any worse, somehow it always did.

Best bit?

T-Rick arrives at the party all guns blazing, sending a neighbour into chaos.

Did you know?

Some of the footage was shot by the cast with cell phones, Flip, iPhone and Blackberry phones that were handed out by the crew. Over 10 hours of footage was recorded mostly due to the cast continuously recording.",1341100800,,1211,4.486363636363636

4446948,1,B004QL7K70,"While the rest of the world plunges into an ever-downward spiraling struggle, fraught with war, famine, murder, rape, alienation, and other ails, Hollywood decided to make this noxiously reprehensible movie embodying absolute idiocy, coupled with a delirious psychotic detachment from reality which happily boasts affectations involving destruction, perverse sex, and partying that brings general hurt to the people, both voluntarily and involuntarily, involved. All this in the name of ""fun and good times."" Just goes to show how many people are living in the same devolving bubble.

If you are into Hangover1 and still think Hangover2 was a great movie as well...then you will love it. If you don't like cheap stories filled up with fun then keep away from it.

I loved Hangover 1 and also liked Hangover 2. so you can guess that I like Project X as well!",1340841600,3,395,3.9125

Unless you're a 14 year old boy don't waste your time.
It seriously is like Superbad, but not even remotely funny.  I didn't laugh once.  A bunch of teenagers at a party and nothing really happens.
I know they were going for the home filmed look, but the camera is SO shakey it makes you nauseous trying to focus.
I really wish I turned this off right away, I just kept waiting for it to get good or something to happen.
This just might be the worst move I have ever seen!",1340755200,11,506,4.153061224489796

Only unlike other party movies that can be sorta fun this one is about these guys wanting to be BIG SHOTS. This was a huge bomb coming from a major studio and it doesn't have much humour even as compared to the hangover. Which is just as dumb and about partying too. This one though would annoy teens even as there is NO plot really. just a extended party video or just a music video with no reason to call itself a movie,  and teens  avoided this movie as much as everyone else did so even they realized this one was not a movie.  The blu ray looks good but it's not staying in my collection that is for sure. I did keep the hangover films though. Those are good dumb party movies.",1339977600,10,838,4.160493827160494
