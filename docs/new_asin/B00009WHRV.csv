You end up not caring one iota about any of the ""characters"". The ""movie"" is simply a vehicle to show a lot of depravity, and a lot of the violence is so superficial that it really isn't believable. I had to rate this movie, so I gave it one star, but it really deserves 0 stars.",1243123200,,417,4.225
7993883,3,B00009WHRV,"John Specht (INSANIAC) brings you into an underground world of hired guns and conspiracy theory, told through the eyes of an apostate angel trying to rid the world of these ""bad"" people.  As an independent moviemaker, Specht utilizes all of his assets to help bring this many-faceted story to life.  The acting ranges from good to mediocre, but none of it detracts from the excitement.  Paul Wendell's portrayal of Dimitri stands out in this movie as one of the better performances.  I recommend checking this movie out.",1121126400,,520,4.942528735632184
