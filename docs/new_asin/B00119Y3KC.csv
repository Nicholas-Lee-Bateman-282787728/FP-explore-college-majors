8241139,3,B00119Y3KC,"Since 1995, Leir claims to have performed ten surgeries on people who say they have survived alien abductions, and has removed eleven implanted objects, including a very unusual and difficult to identify piece of glass. He says he is not interested people's stories, but in the physical and scientific aftermath. His focus of study is what he calls ""a dark gray, shiny membrane"" that is wrapped around the implants.

8241140,5,B00119Y3KC,"If you are at all interesting in looking at physical evidence of alien life or UFO abductions, than this video is for you!  It provides real physical evidence, which I have never seen anywhere else, of possible alien contact with humans, and the implanting of devices in their bodies.  The research and data is very scientific and he uses facts to support the evidence.

Watch this video, it will change your life perspectives and really make you think about the possibility of real alien abductions!",1346889600,,500,4.858823529411764
8241141,5,B00119Y3KC,"""Aliens And The Scalpel"" offers startling research by Dr. Roger Leir about alien implants in humans.  Dr. Leir, a surgeon, claims to have removed at least ten alien implants from humans since 1995.  Admitting that he ""started out trying to disprove claims of implants by abductees,"" his research led him in the opposite direction. With video of surgeries, this presentation is not for the squeamish--aside from that, the implants are a horrifying prospect. The research is compelling and I was chilled to the bone.",1205366400,3,514,5.107142857142857
8241142,5,B00119Y3KC,"I was captivated by this sci-fi documentary that is true!  It is just not common knowledge that implants of a foreign nature have been removed by the claimed abducted.  I also was interested by the ""black budget"" talk.  This is not a kooky ufo film but a credible ufo film with intelligent people of credibility.  Great little film and highly recommended.",1204243200,2,355,4.770491803278689
