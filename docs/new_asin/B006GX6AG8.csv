8497926,5,B006GX6AG8,"From a historical prospective, one would think that after some 22 years, the attitudes and perspectives on the current drug war would have changed. With the exception of medical pot, this debate could have taken place yesterday; it's a testament to how little the drug war has changed.

Aside from the drug war topic, if you like a good back and forth discussion by expert debaters  this is a terrific watch. Of those who participated (William F. Buckley Jr.; Ira Glasser; Charles Rangel; Jerry Falwell; Harold Voth; Michael Kinsley; and others) Ira Glasser (ACLU) was probably one of the best.

It'll be interesting to see how things play out in the following 22 years. The historical trend suggests very little change however, with governments continuing to spend money on law enforcement over drug treatment. I hope this video is still available then...",1375401600,,856,5.014084507042254
8497927,5,B006GX6AG8,"I haven't seen William F. Buckley become so animated sine he threatened to flatten Gore Vidal for calling Buckley a ""crypto Nazi"". The ultimate insult if there ever was one. But here we're not discussing the mass slaughter of a people based on their ethnicity and religion. No. We're discussing a mass killing of another kind; the casualties of drive-by shootings in the height of the drug wars that were in full force in the 80s and 90s.

I am against drugs. I think a person who indulges in them is either stupid and ignorant of their own body, or worse yet, lacks character and desires to be wanted and accepted among a social circle that cherishes a kind of debauchery of a lifestyle. Even so, what a person does to their own body is, in the end, their own business as long as they keep to the spirit of the laws of this land; i.e. your rights end where my rights start. The prohibition of drugs that fall into the category of casual recreational drugs, in the immediacy, harm no one but the user. Afterwards, if a habit is formed to the point of addiction, then, depending on the resilience of that person's neuro-chemistry and general will, things can get dangerous as the addiction will drive a person to unprecedented heights; including the breakage of our most severe laws.

What to do. Alcohol is a primary example, and parallels the drug wars in every way. Prohibition brought us the likes of Scarface and Al Capone. Massacres via the Tommy gun in Chicago and New York, as well as smaller skirmishes around the country, where money of impressive tabulation flowed like today's commodity markets, swapping hands like today's brokers handling billionaires finances. So it is with drug kingpins who, like a portion of the CEO's and lawyers in corporate America (not all, nor even most) could care less who benefits and dies from the use of their product, or distribution thereof.

The cost of the War on Drugs has eaten into government coffers and cost not just treasure, but also blood, mostly those involved in the distribution network and part of the criminal organization that literally fight over territory and markets with full automatic weapons. I can't recite how many killings I perpetually heard about on the news during the 80s and 90s. The problem is still here, and is somewhat loosely under control as of 2013, but not entirely.

In San Francisco cannabis clubs are prevalent for those ""in medical need"" of marijuana; read that as anyone who can convince a doctor to prescribe them the drug. And yes, even though there are plenty who abuse this notion, there are legitimate members of such establishments.

Sweeping generalizations of people gone mad or people getting burnt out is not proven in all cases of addiction, but is the spear point of the argument used by those who would keep such substances illegal for the sake of protecting those susceptible to such chemicals, and those who love them.

Buckley and his team make it a point that criminalizing such substances has brought about unprecedented violence within the inner cities of the United States. And keeping the status quo will invite further battles among rival gangs.

The opposition states that the health issue is the very reason to keep said substances illegal, and that the health hazards are endemic to the violence caused by the trade of drugs. Professionals who would use drugs, such as pilots, doctors, even lawyers; those with critical decision making skills and positions, would endanger those who depend upon their cognitive alacrity. Would you trust a heart surgeon who engaged in recreational drug use?

The death toll is staggering. By that I don't mean users who have overdosed. That happens, but it pales when sized against the number of young men and women, boys and girls, who found themselves the targets of hits, or the unfortunate bystanders who happen to be near a submachinegun spray from a drive by shooting. That is the real cost. Some would say it's a black problem, but the supermajority of the users are white. It is the black population that falls victim to the violence because of the internecine warfare that takes place among the gangs. And, regardless of their origins, they are all Americans.

One doctor on the prohibition side states that if we were to take this problem seriously, we would wage real war. I agree. But the American population prefer accolades to actions that would befit a military conflict against a social scourge like illicit chemicals. The occupation of lands with infantry and armor; checkpoints, inspections, quartering of troops in homes, taking prisoners, and shooting back at gangs, destroying the enemie's strongholds. Who honestly wants that? No one I can think of. But that is what war is all about, and it would work as cited by the doctor on the prohibition side.

There is also a misapprehension; legalization does not imply nor indicate promotion of free access for all who would want access to drugs were they to be decriminalized. The mechanisms of allowance are not in the purview of the debate, but the prohibition side presses the issue with the legalization side of the argument, largely I think, because they know the legalization side has a strong position.

This is the firing line. This is where one side engages the other with sharp words and sharp tongues. Verbal weapons loaded with both grape show and armor piercing arguments. The debate continues to this day, but is no longer at the forefront of the news, as the problem is probably seen as managed. Untrue of course, but there you have it.

Definitely a must see for anyone interested in the topic, or with an ounce of feeling for their fellow man.",1358467200,2,5674,4.820143884892087
8497928,5,B006GX6AG8,"This is quite the conversation, longer and of a different format than the other episodes of firing line it nevertheless gives the viewer a entertaining 2 hours.  The topic is interesting as are the participants and the discussion.  If you don't garner anything from this debate you either must have a closed view or are not able to pick up on the debate.  I felt myself changing my views not on my beliefs but upon my thoughts.",1353542400,,427,4.51948051948052
