8722163,5,B010DRMPXO,"A fantastic concert from the greatest band in the world. R.I.P. Edgar, you are greatly missed. A magical performance from all the band and a farewell to Iris and Linda who, along with all the band, I have met several times and they are lovely ladies and very talented as well. A BIG BIG TD fan and this is a great reminder of a fantastic night and the last time I met and spoke to Edgar. Pure magic and a magnificent Dream!!",1456704000,2,424,4.182926829268292
8722164,5,B010DRMPXO,"The London stop on the final Tangerine Dream concert tour as a six piece band. This captures latter day Tangerine Dream at the top of their game. With the passing of founder and leader Edgar Froese, DVDs are all we have now of a completely unique concert experience... one of the favorite bands of my lifetime. For me, the world without Tangerine Dream is a strange world indeed. Highly recommended.",1455753600,3,399,4.714285714285714
