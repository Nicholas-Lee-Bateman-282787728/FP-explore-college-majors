Since her performance was within the first three minutes of the beginning credits I had very little interest in the rest of a uninteresting, childish, boorish attempt at film making.  One of the five worst movies I have seen in my life.",1390089600,,409,4.746478873239437
8018221,2,B0001Y4M9K,"The lame romantic comedy ""What Boys Like"" is like a warmed-over helping of ""American Pie.""  In the film, three numbskull buddies indulge in boring sexual hijacks at their friend's wedding.  The tale is narrated by Dewey, the typical frat boy misogamist who regales us with his oh-so-clever ""Rules of Man,"" the purpose of which is to instruct the male of the species on the fine art of nailing as many babes as possible without getting hooked in the process.  Dewey makes a bet with his friend, Jay - who, for some strange reason, seems obsessed with having long term relationships - that the latter will not be able to score a one night stand during the weekend, while Jay makes a counter bet that Dewey will not be able to forego sex for the same 48-hour period.  However, things get really complicated when it turns out that Jay is actually in love with the bride-to-be, his old high school sweetheart whom he's never entirely gotten over.

Needless to say, the script employs a series of predictable plot complications, misunderstandings and sexual perversities to generate its humor - which would be fine if any of it were clever or funny.  As Dewey, Alex Nesis provides a certain manic energy that almost makes the concept work.  Nevertheless, even he emerges as a pale imitation of the wonderful Stifler from the ""American Pie"" films.  And this leads us to the basic question as to why one would order this low-cal substitute when the real thing is so much tastier.

Here`s an interesting side item about the film:  according to boxofficemojo.com, since the film's release on 2/27/2004, ""What Men Like"" has amassed a whopping $955 in B.O. revenues, which, at an average ticket price of $6, means that the film was seen by roughly 160 people across the United States and Canada during its limited theatrical release.  After one factors out relatives and friends of those involved in the production, who does that leave?",1109203200,18,1924,4.8
