8115436,4,B000EXDS5W,"This was a great purchase. I love the Mr. & Mrs. Smith movie and would have paid more for it alone, but it was awesome to also get Life or Something Like It; it too is a wonderful cute story. I've never seen Pushing Tin, but now I have it for a price that seems as if I got it free, because I probably would have paid more just to get the first two movies alone. It's great if your an Angelina Jolie fan.",1375660800,,404,3.8214285714285716
8115437,5,B000EXDS5W,This was a great value for the price. I own almost every movie she's starred in or played second fiddle to the star { which is not an easy role for someone of her quality} and enjoyed all three films. I look forward to obtaining more.,1373760000,,234,4.108695652173913

8115441,4,B000EXDS5W,"I bought the Angelina Jolie Collection in Canada. All three DVDs were listed as anamorphic on the cover, but ""Pushing Tin"" was not presented in anamorphic widescreen as stated.

I wonder if the version released at the States has the same issue.

Besides that, a good package for the price.",1151971200,3,289,4.76
