2669603,5,B000JBXH64,"I'm an AP Spanish student (high school) and got my teacher to use this telenovela as a teaching tool. From watching this, we are even able to learn slang, which helps because we are teens and can somewhat relate (even if we are an all-boys Jesuit high school). This US released version should be even more helpful for Spanish students than the one I own because it is subtitled, probably in Spanish. It's very entertaining, in general.

Like many other teens, I fell for the Rebelde and RBD machine. I have a long list of what I want, including their new CD's coming out at the end of the year. My excuse: I'm learning Spanish. And I am!",1163721600,5,637,4.398305084745763

2669623,3,B000JBXH64,"Rebelde  La Temporada (Rebel  - The Season  812 minutes)

 We are in an elite high school where most of the students are from prominent, wealthy families.

One, however is there on a scholarship which he sought so he could find and wreak vengeance on the daughter of the man who killed his father. Miguel (Alfonso Herrera, who has an amazingly natural stage presence) is a handsome, smart young man who is immediately attracted to that same girl, Mia (Anahi). Of course he fights it because of his goal. Then he meets her father, Franco Colucci (Juan Ferrera) and they LIKE each other. This is very disconcerting.

In the meantime, they start a pick-up band which has a terrible time organizing rehearsals because everyone is so self-centered and irresponsible. One of the principals is Roberta (Dulce Maria) whose mother is an established star. This does a pretty realistic job of portraying the vagaries of being teens who don't spend much time worrying about whether or not they are likable.

I haven't seen Season 2 but I see Amazon offers it.",1407542400,,1047,4.810055865921788

2669642,4,B000JBXH64,"I bought this to show my 3rd and 4th year Spanish kids and I was hoping there would be Spanish subtitles to use, however there are only English subtitles.  Also, because they had to cram every episode onto DVDs we miss a lot of what happens and all of a sudden there will be new characters or they will be talking about something we haven't seen.  Luckily we have some students from Mexico who are more than happy to fill the rest of the class in - all in Spanish of course.  This show is good for high school aged kids and it is very dramatic which makes learning Spanish fun.  We watch about 30-45 minutes on Fridays, but during the week they beg me to watch Rebelde!",1173312000,,669,4.203125
2669643,2,B000JBXH64,"I bought the Season 1 DVDs of Rebelde because I read that the series was very popular with teenagers in Mexico.  Being a Spanish teacher, I wanted to use this DVD with my classes to both teach the language and the culture of ""telenovelas"" in Latin America.  I thought my students would love to watch a show that was popular with people their age.

When I received the DVDs, I quickly watched the first DVD.  It starts out with the introduction of each character and how they get along (or not get along) with each other.  Right from the beginning you can tell that the editing is quite choppy, cutting a scene mid-way to introduce another important character.  Then, towards the middle of the first DVD, some characters that were introduced as being friendless, all of a sudden have friends, and characters that didn't get along, were now confiding in each other.  They refer to events that we haven't been shown, and before we know it, they're going on a class trip to the beach, staying who knows where.  The part that got me was that all of a sudden, without any explanation or segue, one of the characters tries to hurt another character very badly, to the point where they're struggling and pleading for their lives; fast forward 20 minutes, and they're talking to each other as if nothing bad had happened.

Having never seen the series before, Rebelde Season 1 DVD seems to have been cut to its bare bones, leaving many plot points out, and making plot twists seem like introductions to a new plot.  I was very disappointed with this product.",1171756800,29,1549,4.6
2669644,2,B000JBXH64,"There is no excuse for cutting out every other important scene. I have seen most of the 1st sesaon, however since I only got univision (not telemundo) on my antennae and it aired a 2pm, I did miss some inbetween.  Go to best buy and look at any Season DVD of a TV series (i.e, CSI, Friends, etc.)  they cost more than 20 bucks. I would have been happier paying more and getting the whole season than what i got.  each disk is a stream of scenes from the show, that while in order, miss important events, etc.  If they didn't want to charge people more than 20 bucks for the disks, than they should have split up the season into 2 dvd packs, i guarantee people are going to buy it.

About the english subtitles, yes they have them and they are pretty well done.",1170374400,11,760,4.178082191780822
2669645,5,B000JBXH64,"I saw like almost the whole telenovela when it was on T.V, I needed to buy this because I truly love this telenovela. I already knew the plot and well for someone who is seeing this for the first time.. well they will get confused. It does jump around a lot and cut out quite a lot. Some of the parts cut out were really good scenes. But overall I really did enjoy this but obviously for someone who knows the plot will enjoy it. But if you want to see this for the first time, you will get really confused and won't really like the telenovela. Sometimes I was confused lol. It does have Subtitles which is a plus. But.. on the cover of Amazon, it says that it's more than 14 hours ""mas de 14 Horas"" But when I got the dvd in mail. It says 13 and a half hours on the cover. So Amazon must've got this confused. I wish it was more than 14 hours. Overall I really liked it :)",1169251200,5,873,3.965909090909091
2669646,3,B000JBXH64,"Season 1 was the longest of all the 3 seasons of Rebelde and in order to fit it into 3 CD's many scenes were taken out. This makes it harder for someone who didn't watch the novela when it originally aired to fully understand the plot line, since it jumps around and skips some character intro's, etc. It jumps around skipping parts in the the ""Logia"" plot, the whole Teo make-over, Nico & Lupita's relationship just to name a few.",1168214400,2,431,4.4

2669649,5,B000JBXH64,"The ""elite Way School"" is an exclusive private high school of international prestige where adolescent of high class find not only a high level of education, but the social contacts that assure a successful future to them.
The school also counts on a program of scholarships for young people of low resources with excellent academic or sport level. Nevertheless, few of them manage to graduate since they are persecuted by a secret society called ""the Lodge"" whose intention is to conserve the ""purity"" of the privileged class.
Between the group of people who arrives at the summering club that precedes to the scholastic year are Ma, Miguel, Diego and Roberta, four youngsters who in spite of their great differences, discover something that will unite them over the social prejudices: their huge love for the music.
Roberta is daughter of a famous singer who detests the rules and the traditions. The fact to grown under the shade of her mother makes her doubt as much of her beauty, as of her enormous musical talent.

Miguel comes from the city of Monterrey and studies in the school with a scholarship, but his true intention is not to obtain contacts that help to raise him in the social scale, but to take revenge himself of the man to whom fault of the ruin and death of his father, but His life seems to collapse when discovers that it is the father of the girl whom he loves, Ma.
For Diego, son of an important politician, music is only hobby. From boy he knows that its destiny is the policy and has inherited the arrogant and prepotent attitude of his father, to that admires more than to anybody, and who never is satisfied with the profits of Diego. Ma she is daughter of a prestigious industralist of the fashion, and like so, she detests the cheap life. She is popular, it cheers and extrovert, but the ""sugar castle"" where she lives will make pieces to the knowledge that his father has fallen in love with a woman to whom considers vulgar terribly: Alma Rey, Roberta's mother. These four young people and all their companions will live in the school experiences that will mold their intellectual and moral development. Also they will question the values of his families under the influence of the new teacher, Enrique Madariaga, a famous writer, ex- scholarship holder of the school, that besides to guide them by the way of the ethics and the dignity, is determined to end the Lodge.
