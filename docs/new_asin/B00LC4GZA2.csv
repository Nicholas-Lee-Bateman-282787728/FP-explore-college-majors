8665131,5,B00LC4GZA2,"Looking at this Set I had No idea that there would be a Gem in it that I'd Never seen before but the set looked Intriguing so I bought it. The 1st movie call ""Hitler: Rise of Evil"" is a two part total Canadian Major movie done about Hitler's early life growing up and how he eventually got into politics and How he formed the Nazi party. Over the years I had read bits & pieces of these facts but had never seen all of it in a movie. WOW, what an Excellent movie this is and by itself is more than worth the cost of the entire set.

Some of the other movies I had seen before, but additionally a few more in this set were also worth the price of the set by themselves.",1426896000,2,668,3.911764705882353
