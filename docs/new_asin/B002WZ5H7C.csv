4008493,5,B002WZ5H7C,"I have no idea why this movie is being introduced as a vehicle for Casper Van Dien and Jon Seda, because this movie is about the friendship between 3 latin women.  This movie stars Vanessa Marcil, Tessie Santiago and Jaqueline Pinol.  Superbly acted by all three women. This movie was real, funny, touching, heart breaking and triumphant. It is about life, love and friendship. I first saw this movie on Lifetime, so it does have its share of drama, but it not the usual Lifetime fare, as no one is being chased, beaten or victimized. Margarita, played by Marcil is an immigration lawyer who is married and just became partner in her firm. She is struggling with the decision to have a child, while her husband was ready to be a father yesterday and this causes conflict in the marriage. Matters become more complicated when her first love comes back in town and mixes things up ALOT.  Anabel, played by Santiago is a stay at home mom of 3 boys who finds out that her husband is having an affair. She struggles with the decison of whether to stay and work it out or leave her husband. Viviana, played by Pinol is a high powered VP of an international bank. She is a single woman wanting to adopt a child. Of the 3 women, she is the most ""Americanized"", as she believes that her ethnicity causes her not to be treated equally in the business world. So she dyes her hair, goes by a more Americanized version of her name and seeks to adopt a white child. How the storyline all comes together is surprising and unpredictable. A must see!",1262995200,8,1533,4.4678571428571425
