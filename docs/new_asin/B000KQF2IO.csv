8158739,1,B000KQF2IO,DVD does not work.  Unusable.  Will return it.,1485129600,,46,4.625
8158740,5,B000KQF2IO,Great DVD.  Tai Chi strengthens your your muscles and gives you better balance.  I have taken many classes and bought this DVD to beable to use it at home.  Slow movements but does the job.,1408924800,,189,4.3428571428571425
8158741,5,B000KQF2IO,"I have arthritis and I find Tai Chi very helpful.  This book makes learning the moves very easy.
I would recommend it to any of my friends who want to learn Tai Chi..",1364947200,2,166,4.03030303030303
8158742,4,B000KQF2IO,"This video is not for advanced arthritis people. The movements are slow but still require a decent amount of strength and flexability. With practice, I'm sure you will be able to do just about everything he does, but time may vary. If you do not have advanced arthritis, then this video is an excellent way to keep the flexability and strength.",1268092800,,344,4.655737704918033
8158743,2,B000KQF2IO,"This DVD wasn't what I was looking for.  I've taken Tai Chi classes for about a year now and wanted a DVD that I could use when I can't go to class (vacations, etc.).  I wanted a 30-60 minute routine I could do along with the DVD.  This is a very slow-moving DVD that shows (in very slow detail) the correct form for just the first 12 or so moves.  It's only at the end that it goes through all the first 12 moves, but doesn't touch on all the rest of the moves.  I guess I needed to purchase the next DVD up in the series... or something...

I would only want this DVD if I'd never done Tai Chi before and wanted detailed lessons on how to do the very beginning moves.",1259020800,,669,3.955223880597015
8158744,5,B000KQF2IO,"A Tai Chi teacher (who lives in another city) recommended this as a great introduction to Tai Chi. (You don't even have to have arthritis.)

Instructions are clear and shown from front and back.",1246838400,,194,4.705882352941177
8158745,1,B000KQF2IO,"I woke up about 3 am and couldn't fall back to sleep.  So I thought I'd pop in the Tai Chi DVD I bought and watch it through before actually trying it.
I guess this guy is good, but good golly Miss Molly, it just couldn't move any slower and the folks in the video can't be any less than 70 or 75 years old.  No need to watch this one through before trying it, it goes soooooo slowly that you can toss in laundry and cook Christmas dinner between the moves.  I realize that one needs to be careful when doing any exercise, but one warning at the beginning is good, I don't need a warning every other sentence.  I got to the point of the first move, and just couldn't watch any more.
And the warm up exercises, ARGH!  The man who does them is VERY elderly and hard to understand and again with the warnings... OY!  And somewhere I missed in the description that this tape is from Austalia, and they are have lovely accents, but hard to understand!
I think I'll tuck this one away and get it out when I'm 80.  :)
Not worth the $$ I paid for this, in fact, I'm sending it back.  This is for folks who are VERY elderly or VERY debilitated.  I didn't realize it mean elderly, I know a lot of folks who aren't 75 but do have bad arthritis, but this is NOT NOT NOT geared to anyone under 75ish.
Obviously I am VERY dissapointed in this.",1209254400,7,1329,4.0807692307692305
8158746,5,B000KQF2IO,"I got this DVD because arthritis and a back/leg/nerve injury were leaving me with limited flexibility and a lot of pain.  I alternate this DVD with 'Healing Yoga for Aches & Pains' (the Matkins), and have found that my flexibility, strength and posture have gradually improved and I experience less pain and need pain relievers less.

I really love this DVD because the class/instructors/demonstrators are normal, everyday people, older, with some stiffness of their own.  It's encouraging to see them work through the poses, each with their own degree of perfection.  Once you learn the routines, you can practice them along with Dr. Lamm- this is fun.  On a good day, my body feels like it is floating through the routines!  Dr. Lamm is very inspiring and his DVD is very helpful for arthritis stiffness and pain.  It's just what my doctor ordered.",1200096000,19,850,4.9020979020979025
8158747,5,B000KQF2IO,"Dr. Lam does an excellant job in explaining and practicing each move front and back and then putting it into the pattern.  Also gives good discription of alternatives to take into account one's individual joint problems;  I am just sorry that the CD was not for the entire program for arthritis, but just the first third.  This should have been explained that it was only a partial program.",1196899200,15,390,4.705882352941177
8158748,5,B000KQF2IO,"I have been practicing Tai Chi Chuan for almost a year. I had begun practice of this form for stress reduction and because I have stiffness in my shoulders and neck.  I practice the simplified 24-form Yang Style Tai Chi.

Everybody says how beneficial Tai Chi is for people who are senior citizens, but it did not take me long to notice that many of the forms in the 24-form Yang Style are inappropriate for people with balance problems, bad knees, and the like.  Not to worry, Dr. Paul Lam has put together a 12-form Tai Chi that they can do.  The video begins with a discussion of the health benefits of Tai Chi, including interviews with leading rheumatologists (arthritis specialists), as well as testimonials of Tai Chi practitioners who have benefitted from Tai Chi, and as a result, were able to reclaim their lives from arthritis. I liked the fact that this DVD did not dwell too much on traditional Chinese medicine or the martial aspects of Tai Chi.  What is important for me is that it works.

The exercises presented on this DVD are appropriate for most people, and, with some modification can even be performed by those who are wheelchair bound.  The emphasis is not on producing a form of exercise that is delightful to watch other people do but rather on what can best benefit the practitioner of the art.

I would like to add a caveat that this DVD should be seen as either an adjunct or a supplement to regular Tai Chi classes and practice. One benefits from having instruction of a qualified instructor.  I am not just saying this to generate business for Tai Chi instructors. I am saying it because a good instructor can help you get going, give suggestions on modifying the form to meet your individual requirements and capabilities, as well as to provide the encouragement to keep going. Going to classes also provides you with a built-in support group of people who are of like interest and share experiences with you.

It is up to you to get out there and do the gentle form of therapy that offers so much in benefits.",1187913600,46,2041,4.582417582417582
