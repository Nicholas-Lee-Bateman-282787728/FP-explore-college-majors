8220824,3,B000RGXE50,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my girlfriend who loves mid-centry furniture and decor.  I'm not sure what the overall purpose of this DVD is, but we found only a couple of the seven or eight (can't remember the exact number) short clips on this DVD to be worth while.  The first is an old short about a young couple on a budget trying to decorate their apartment/house--it shares some ideas for re-doing furniture and advises you to look in thrift stores for hidden gems.  Yeah, i knew that already! :)  One short was of a woman demonstrating an old TV, but the video did not have any sound.  The coolest video, in my opinion, showed to process of designing a new car body (can't remember the make...maybe a Chevy) and building a model from scratch.
Anyways, this is entirely vintage footage, but to me didn't really reveal anything new about the time period I couldn't figure out by looking at pictures of old furniture.  The video quality is really good, I have to give the manufacturer credit, and they ship fast.",1224547200,,1017,4.5
