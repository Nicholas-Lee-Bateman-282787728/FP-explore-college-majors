Okay, I had to give this a whole lot of thought.  The point that Ustinov was trying to make which I had missed is this:  He portrayed a dictator that really needed to be removed so, he was removed but the thing is that he did it in such a roundabout way, by the time his death scene finally takes place, who cares?  He really should've taken a way more direct approach but, get this, Ustinov had somehow managed to retain the rights to this film posthumously so that a remake can't ever be made.",1431475200,,633,4.206611570247934
8057861,1,B00097E74Y,"I was disappointed . it did not capture the feeling of story of  Yasar Kemal , s novel "" Ince Memed"" Memed My Hawk . I am always very found Of Peter  Ustinov whom he did part as  villain in the movie  Peter Ustinov disappointed  me either as an actor as Villain as well as his directorial work The  story  is poorly presented. It was a story of tale and spirits of people of cotton pickering in Cukurova in the novel ..This was by passed ,not included  The  cinematography was poor  below  the average  This  movie should be done by better director  Who may capture and understand the real story of ""ince Memed"" as written as By great writer Mr Yasar Kemal. I wish great English director Sir David Lean were  alive whom could have made  Memed my Hawk as-good as Dr Zhivago
My rate the Movie is one and a half stars . Selcuk Sozen",1408752000,3,829,4.217948717948718
