8525663,3,B0085MJ6Y6,"I would not pay money to see this film. It's a shame what a low budget can do along with the fact being that it needed more work before the release. The story was good, but needed to be filled out a little as far as the motivation for the creation of the picture (portal) and the intention for it's use which was never explained. If the film would have been done right with a heavier budget and a coherent plot, it could have been a grade A movie. It's a shame really. The idea was good but the execution of the film was wrong. I still gave it a three for the known actors/actress in the film, and for the person who had the idea and attempted to put it on film.",1495324800,,662,3.9849624060150375

8525667,2,B0085MJ6Y6,"As a Michael Muhney fan from The Youbg & The Restless, I bought this DVDS to see him. He plays a Los Angeles medical examiner. Jenna Zablocki plays Dr April Meadows. There is also Michael Madsen and Stacy Keach in the cast.

Serge Rodunsky wrote, directed and produced this mess of a film. We never get to know the truth about what is going on. There is plenty of unnecessary gore and blood spewing around.

The director needs to go back to film school because this amateur work. I could have done a better job filming this mess. I wouldn't leave the audience hanging. There are no extra features on this DVD. You can see why this film went directly to DVD because it's that bad.",1424044800,4,679,4.380952380952381
8525668,1,B0085MJ6Y6,"Sorry not much I can say regarding this movie. I just couldn't get into it, seemed to switch gears and confuse, rather then entertain.",1400025600,3,134,4.625
8525669,1,B0085MJ6Y6,"THE PORTAL is astonishingly incompetent in such basics as writing and editing. The viewer struggles to assemble the various scenes and characters into a coherent whole. Normally, that job belongs to the writer, director, and editor, but since this film is such a jumbled mess, the viewer is left to connect the pieces into something intelligible. Good luck with that.

The story begins in Bulgaria, A.D. 497. A monk scribbles a black mess onto some paper. Meanwhile, a black mess supernaturally manifests on a wall. We return to this setting several times during the film -- at one point the monk has become a raving lunatic in a dungeon cell -- without gaining any real insight as to what it all means.

Most of the story occurs in contemporary Los Angeles. People are contracting this blood disease, which, in its final stage, causes the head to explode. Lead medical examiner Michael Madsen is baffled.

The star of this mess is his assistant, April, played by Jenna Colby. There are other characters, some of whose heads explode. I'm not sure how they're all interrelated.

At one point we meet Valerie, played by Laura Sorenson. Sorenson is also one of the film's executive producers, which implies that she helped finance this film. I guess that explains her presence in the cast.

Valerie dies, perhaps twice. Once her head explodes. Later we see her hanging herself. I'm not sure. Some other guy, who apparently had sex with Valerie (or the other woman?) tells a story to Colby and her co-worker, that involves Valerie (or someone who looks like her?) and two of her ... fellow college students? They have this professor (Stacey Keach) who wrote a book about this black painting, which resembles the black mess on the 5th century monk's wall.

Colby and her coworker find this black painting among --- Valerie's? -- possessions. Staring at the painting makes you contract a blood disease, from some supernatural portal, which causes your head to eventually explode. But only after you cover your bedroom walls and ceiling with newspapers and rectangular markings, and a spirit entity enters your body.

Seriously. Entering the news-papered bedroom of a past victim is apparently one way of contracting this blood disease.

There are so many flashbacks, and dream sequences, and marginal characters who look alike, all of it edited into an artsy jumble, I wasn't sure how this or that person was related, or what was going on.

Another reason for viewer confusion is the poor sound mix. Sometimes the music gets REALLY LOUD. I think this is to create suspense and excitement. OOOOO, LOUD MUSIC! Can you FEEL the TERROR! The problem is the music drowns out the dialog. Characters are still talking, discussing some key plot points, when the music gets REAL LOUD and we strain to hear the remainder of the conversation.

At one point Colby questions Keach about the black painting. Keach says he knows nothing about it -- where it came from, what it is, or how to stop it -- even though he wrote a book about it. I'm guessing that writer/director Serge Rodnunsky himself was confused by his own script, so he figured -- why explain it? Just let it be ""mysterious.""

Near the end, Colby asks the evil entity (which in this scene manifests as an angelic young girl, wings and all) -- WHY?

The evil child replies, ""To pass the time.""

That's it? Well, Keach did say the whole thing was incompressible. ""How do you explain God, or space, or time?"" he says.

Oooooo, heavy!

I suppose that watching THE PORTAL is another way to ""pass the time."" The makeup effects are good -- cool head explosions. And there are some nice shots of Los Angeles, its art deco buildings and palm trees, much of it moody and atmospheric. But these minor strengths can't make up for the incoherent script and editing, and a sound mix that buries important dialog.

It's amazing THE PORTAL is not a first effort. The IMDb credits Rodnunsky with 37 writing credits, and 42 directing credits, going back to 1990. I haven't seen his other ""work,"" but if THE PORTAL (2010) reflects his skills level after 20 years of working as a ""seasoned pro,"" then I suspect Rodnunsky's body of work might beat&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uwe-Boll/dp/B00I0B6A3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uwe Boll</a>&nbsp;for the ""worst director of his generation"" title.",1398643200,5,4363,4.956164383561644
8525670,1,B0085MJ6Y6,"This is one of the dumbest movies I have seen. Not much is explained. The editing is really bad. And the acting is even worse.
And all the while incidental music is playing even though the incidents make no sense.",1393977600,2,213,4.35
