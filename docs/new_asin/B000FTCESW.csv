8126455,5,B000FTCESW,I had purchased this for my wife who has played through the star ocean series. I've never watched it in its entirety but she says its almost scene for scene throughout the games. The voice acting is decent but if you're a true anime fan you'll watch it in its native language.,1369526400,,276,4.326923076923077
8126456,3,B000FTCESW,"All I can say is what the heck. I did like the series it was very good up until the ending. It ends with them going to confront the main enemy. what kind of ending is that. I mean does Claude get home, what happens to Rena, what even happens to the rest of them. Also, do they even figure out where Rena is from :( I always thought a series was supposed to end with the enemy defeated and questions answered. The only other one that I know of that does this is Saint Seiya leaving off with an arrow in the girls chest (I know ADV went out of business but somebody please finish):(",1278979200,,580,4.008620689655173
8126457,5,B000FTCESW,"This was based off the game if you ever played star ocean you will understand it. About a young man stuck in his fathers foot steps lost on who he is as a person. That lands some where discovers who he is how to put others before his own self.this has it all action drama comedy on down. Its a must see well written voices are perfect in this anime seris.
Its a must buy if you like anime an are sick of the violence stuff.",1240272000,,423,3.9302325581395348
8126458,4,B000FTCESW,"I was excited to hear about an anime based on the game Star Ocean: The Second Story, as it is one of my favorite games to date!

When I first came across some episodes a few years back, I was deeply intrigued.  The animation is crisp and clear, the music nice, and very good voice acting.

There is only one major drawback.  This anime was only half way completed.  It was completed on episode 26 while the rest of the series was just recorded as audio disks instead of animation.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has played the game as it sticks to the plot with little change, and with the series ending in the middle, fans of the game are sure to know how it would end anyway.  Yet, seeing a complete anime series of this would be great.  Those not familiar with the game could give this a watch, but don't get too involved unless you plan on playing the game.  You'll only be left disappointed and confused when it ends abruptly.

I happen to own the DVD set with the horribly English subtitled version of this series that I bought from Ebay.  It was cheap to say in the least.  For those interested in checking it out, go ahead, I say it's worth it.  Only if you've played the game though, since some names are mistranslated.

As for this to be released boxset, I hope that the translations are better... especially for this price, and that it also comes with the second half of the series on audio since I haven't come across them yet.",1153008000,5,1447,4.311111111111111
8126459,4,B000FTCESW,"There's a low cost ""New DVD"" version of this with abominable English subtitles, which you can find on eBay.  Evidently, the Japanese was translated into English by Chinese speakers, so Precis is ""Polixisi"", Claude is ""Kuloto"", and worse.  Not only is the translation horrible, but the spoken Japanese is absolutely sparkling clear and nothing like the dub.  That said, ANY Star Ocean DVD is interesting, and may be worth collecting.  If THIS particular set is well-dubbed, and the price suggests it probably is, I'm certainly going to think about buying... which I am ;-)",1150416000,4,571,5.042553191489362
