4595341,3,B0057G0JS0,"A lot of the basic points the author makes are very valid, and integral to learning weapons defense. However, beyond that, the overall dvd was unimpressive:

The rehearsal of the ukis must have been limited, since the demonstrations were not fluid whatsoever, with visible mistakes. These mistakes were sometimes attempted to be teachable moments, but as they were unplanned, didn't shed as much light or have as much impact as they could have. There is also little to no explanation about what makes the moves Yang Jwing-Ming traditional. I would have preferred to see a deeper explanation of the traditional technique with the dagger attack, without that, this DVD basically looks like a bunch of universal knife attack defense techniques.",1317340800,4,741,5.175
4595342,3,B0057G0JS0,"While watching this DVD, I noticed that there was good advice about taking the proper angles, clearing the distance, and controlling the weapon by controlling the man, keeping good distance from your body and the knife, by utilizing a 45 degree angle. This knowledge is critical for a proper defense, the more familiar you are with getting into tricky positions, the harder it will be for your enemy cause harm to you. Clearing a distance with a stick also will trump the man with the short blade, and attacking the hands are a few little tricks to the trade, exposed in this DVD. However, If you are a person who has not spent countless hours in a Dojo or with a training partner somewhere catching training knives,  then I would not take this DVD beyond instruction for training, and in the mean time, run away if someone pulls a knife on you, This DVD is not designed, and thankfully so to be a confidence booster. If I could give any person advice about defending themselves when it comes to a blade, I would tell them to run, get in the public eye, call for help, ask for help, and if you cannot do this, now it is time to take all those hours of  training dedication to your personal protection to work.  Keep in mind if you try to take a knife from a person with full intention of cutting you, it is not a matter of getting cut, it is a matter of where and how bad, what is most important is your survival and raising the odds of it.
  I recommend this DVD to people who already have knowledge of self defense. I am sure the good Dr. Ming would agree with me, that watching this DVD a couple of times and spending a hour or two on the techniques shown is not enough to take a unarmed person and place him up against a blade armed attacker, but it is better then not having exposed yourself to the idea's of getting out of the way. As for the inexperienced, i would recommend this video to be watched with a friend and practice one or two techniques at a time together, practice static, practice initial strike, then practice living movement, you will be amazed I am sure with the results.

4595343,5,B0057G0JS0,"Dr. Yang utilizes 3 of his students (2 men, 1 woman) in demonstrating defense techniques when being attacked in various ways by someone with a dagger.  He goes through various types of attacks with the attacker, running straight at you, coming from the side, from behind etc. He goes through different defenses for each type of attack and even takes into consideration variations needed for people of different heights.

His teaching is easy to understand and has his students showing the different techniques from different viewing angles so you can fully see what's going on.  He has his students going over it again and again so you're sure to see and understand everything fully.  Dr. Yang shows this isn't necessarily a staged video because the students do make mistakes and he patiently corrects them and shows why it would be better another way.  There is also a silent playful banter going on between students, which makes it much more interesting to watch and makes you feel you are there taking class with them!",1316995200,2,1021,4.878612716763006
4595344,5,B0057G0JS0,"KNIFE DEFENSE
Traditional Techniques Against Dagger

To write a review for this DVD is to write a review for every instructional DVD published by Dr. Yang.  In a word: Exceptional. And that is pretty much what I have come to expect from YMAA Publication Center.

Each and every instructional DVD is complete and well instructed.  And ""KNIFE DEFENSE"" is no exception.  Moves and theories are well communicated.  And Dr. Yang's students are suitably incorporated to demonstrate, not only the move/moves themselves, but he corrects those students patiently and appropriately when they make a mistake.  And, here, mistakes are the key.

Dr. Yang fittingly utilizes their mistakes.  Knowing all along that you at home are, probably making the very same mistake.  He allows this to follow a natural course, one necessary in the learning process.  And he utilizes these opportunities to reach out to the viewer.

Included are more that 30 ""do-able"" techniques and the appropriate training drills.  Each is fit for the intermediate to the advanced student... though one or two are actually geared towards the novice practitioner (no advance student will feel cheated. Watch...Learn).  For me the discussion and training for timing and distance were invaluable. And, overall, I really like having this DVD as a reference in my training portfolio.

If you are even considering an instructional video for defense against a knife attack, look no farther!",1315958400,2,1442,5.235807860262009
4595345,5,B0057G0JS0,"This YMAA, Dr. Yang created DVD offers a unique traditional approach to managing a standard lunging knife thrust where the edge weapon is held in a saber grip and against the plunging, ice-pick grip hand hold of the same knife.  With these two primary attacking cues, Dr. Yang then proceeds to explain in detail and demonstrate the three important concepts needed to successfully defend against the above knife assaults.  The following technical applications then build upon and arise from the expression of these three key concepts of acute sensitivity to distancing, proper hand controls executed with the precise angling of the body away from the blade, and the third concept of repelling and covering actions, appropriately intercepting the attacking limb.

First off, Dr. Yang and his three assistants demonstrate a series of drills necessary to ingrain the correct physical expressions of these three key concepts, whereby Dr. Yang points out and corrects, basic errors that are commonly performed when learning to physically express the concepts.  The goal is in leading his student assistant in achieving the precise motor skill applications built upon these concepts.  Dr. Yang emphasizes the importance of developing high levels of proficiency in understanding and engaging these concepts, because if these concepts are not fully mastered, one will own great difficulty in executing the necessary technical applications to follow.

The varying skill level of each of the three assistants illustrates the unique biological differences of each assistant occurring during practice, and how each individual presents a unique set of learning capabilities.  This is unique to Dr. Yang's learning materials that I believe helps the viewer see mistakes from different perspectives and learning abilities, and how best to correct those mistakes.  We are not all the same, and traditional martial arts has always understood this, approaching instruction with this truth of differences as its core guiding principle.

Once the three fundamental concepts are fully explained with the necessary drills required to help a practitioner solidify understanding in the movement patterns, the techniques begin.  The first ten applications utilize principle of Chi Na against the simple dagger attacking in the lunging, linear thrust and the arcing, plunging stab.

Again, details are forthcoming, as the three students take turns attacking each other and Dr. Yang, to gain an understanding of what a correctly executed technique accomplishes.  The viewer gains insights to the principles unfolding in their physical expressions, as the three students take turns attacking and defending with each.  We can visual observe the different interpretations each student provides the viewer, while executing his or her understanding.  Dr. Yang then guides his assistants to reach an acceptable level of performance, pointing out the common errors that occur, with the subsequent corrections to those errors.

Once the thorough study and expression of the ten Chi Na applications are detailed, we move onto the fifteen Shuai Jiao applications.  Dr. Yang instructs these ""wrestling-like"" movements with his usual attention to detail, and the correct performance of the Shuai Jiao actions against the two traditional knife assaults listed above.

Continuously, throughout the DVD, Dr. Yang discusses the inherent dangers of knife assaults, and that the best defense is to avoid such assaults, altogether.  He also stipulates that if one is attacked, one must quickly take control of the situation, being the knife assailant's ability to use the knife against us.  He states how this can be achieved with safe distancing, angling of our body away from the knife, with simultaneous and spontaneous controlling applications or interceptions of the knife arm, sticking to that arm so that the enemy is unable to use that tool to harm us, as we execute key techniques to finally put an end to the assailant's attempt to harm us.

This DVD does demonstrate a very unique perspective, adhering to traditional Chinese methods of combat.  The video is information rich, with the essential details one can use toward understanding this traditional approach to knife defense.  As Dr. Yang states that there is about ten years' worth of information presented here, meaning there is enough technical information to keep a dedicated traditional martial arts practitioner busy for ten years, striving for mastery of these very key, fundamental applications of counter dagger work.  I would have to agree.

The traditional approach to martial arts study and practice has often been a target of modern commercial martial arts practitioners and commercial combatives programs' scorn, saying that there is nothing of value to this extended study approach--""it's not practical and takes too long,"" are the two principal arguments contemporaries provide.

I have always disagreed with such assertions, as originally, traditional systems where what real warriors learned, perfected and utilized to go to war--which was a face to face, very personal affair.  If we look much more deeply at the essence of this DVD's fundamental approach to learning knife assaults, along with taking the time to actually master the motor skills and mindset required to fully manage such potentially lethal force assaults, something happens to the very inner being of the practitioner not afforded to those who wish a quick and easy fix to combat problems--we see the forest for the trees and we even see each individual tree within the forest, just as it really is.

Dr. Yang stresses throughout the DVD how dangerous the dagger assault is, and how quickly it occurs.  Dr. Yang reminds the three practitioners demonstrating the motor skills applications, just how quickly and deadly knife assaults occur.  He continues to stress how they must learn to move emphatically, through continuous, consistent and correct practice, if they truly want to be able to negate a dedicated enemy using a dagger.  This is one of the key advantages of a traditional approach when the training is correctly conceived and implemented over contemporary standard affair--professional proficiency in martial kinematics takes a long time of dedicated and disciplined work to achieve and maintain.  But once such proficiency is achieved, the physical outcomes become masterful, almost unfathomable, in the fluidity, seamlessness and spontaneously correct fashion the motor skills unfold.

I give the DVD a five star rating for the reason of its genuine traditional approach to counter-blade work.  This is not a diluted traditional affair.  This is a fundamental, beginner's peek, into a genuine traditional approach to martial arts training that takes a life time to master.  And this is just the first stepping stone toward understanding knife assaults from such a truly traditional perspective.",1314144000,4,6914,5.42390289449113
4595346,5,B0057G0JS0,"Distance, angling, intercepting, timing, gripping, drilling and practice are all skills needed to defend and/or escape from a knife/dagger attack.

Dr. Yang says in the training that ""Talking is easy, application is harder, you need to practice."" Training to defend against a knife attack is not the same as training other martial arts forms. A small mistake in push hands might land you on your back, or break a rib. A small slice to the neck or wrist might make you die. The moves must be fast, precise and effective. You must be aware that the knife in the hands of someone not so skilled can be deadly, but in the hands of a professional will be deadly if you are not focused.

The DVD shows very clearly what to look for when defending against an attack. Spacing between yourself and the attacker changes quickly if he changes hands or grip, if he steps or angles, if you deflect with the wrong hand. A space of a mere inch can mean the difference between a block or a blood-letting.

Drills are shown using a standard grip or a stab down type of grip, they are shown from all sides so you get a look at stepping and body angles as well as hand and arm positions. Adjustments are made for women, smaller, weaker people who may have to use a shoulder for leverage instead of a forearm.

Attention is paid to the ""Empty Door"", or the space where you an get in quickly to the attackers personal space. Dr. Yang points out that this is important, not only to stay away from the knife blade, but also so that you can protect from being Bumped by the attacker.

I like the way he describes some of the techniques, such as ""Old man carries a big fish on his back"". You can see how an old man might bend over, pop up his butt and hoist a heavy fish onto his shoulder.

Even though the DVD is intense and serious, I like the little comments by Dr. Yang to bring a little humor and lightness to a brutal practice. At one point one of the students looks like he is drained from all the joint locks and applications. Dr. Yang says, "" Just don't kill each other, I need you to finish the session to the end."" A very practical comment, not concerned for the discomfort being caused, or the possibility of a law suit by and injured student, just finish the session.

Later he notes to that same student, ""You showed mercy to him"". That student was cooperating in the spirit of learning techniques, but Dr. Yang tells them that is okay in the training, but sometimes you have to train a little bit harder because a real attacker will not be cooperating with you. You have to be prepared both mentally and physically. You need speed and body memory.

He also says that modern people are sometimes weak from using too many machines, computers, etc. Our hands and bodies are weak. We need to train Gong as well as Techniques. If you train only technique and skill when young, when you are old you will be empty with no Gong Fu. Go into the woods and snap branches, practice distance, angles, power and practice some more.",1313971200,,3007,4.3859964093357275

8460656,5,B0057G0JS0,"Another excellent video by Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming and YMAA.  Good techniques; however, you still need to have lots of practice to be good at defending against a knife.",1357430400,,164,4.857142857142857
8460657,5,B0057G0JS0,"Thirty responses to a single knife attack are presented in this YMAA instructional video: fifteen joint lock (chin na) techniques, ten wrestling (shuai jiao) techniques, and five techniques utilizing common objects.  The DVD has a skill level rating of II to III, which is possibly too generous.  I would suggest a skill level rating of III to even IV, based on the topic and the prior knowledge, or skill set required to effectively learn the techniques presented.  To understand the intercepts used, the viewer should review  Shaolin White Crane Basic Training 1 & 2, Chin Na in Depth Vol. 1-4 (or minimally, Analysis of Chin Na) for understanding of the techniques used, and Shuai Jiao, Kung Fu Wrestling for understanding of the throws presented.  This being said, the material presented in this DVD is an excellent accompaniment for practitioners familiar with the YMAA curriculum.  Clearly, the DVD is marketed towards YMAA students, or at least those familiar with the YMAA Shaolin material.  However, most martial artists will  find value in the DVD.

Typical of Dr. Yang's training DVDs, demonstrations of ""right-way"" and ""wrong-way"" are made as he allows you to see common mistakes made by his students (a point missed by a previous reviewer). Variations of some techniques, based on strength or height differences of the players, are shown.  Similarly, a female student performer allows a visual and, some analysis and discussion of a man vs. woman encounter.

Some reviewers have presented some concern about the seemingly lack of discussion about the seriousness and possible deadly consequences of knife encounters.  Admittedly, this video seems a little lean about the ""reality"" of knife fights, but then again the point of the video is to present application of certain techniques when confronted with knife-wielding assailants, not how to avoid violent encounters.  As previously stated, this video is clearly geared towards martial artists who are at least somewhat familiar with the specific techniques and principles required in order for to be effective.  To those concerned, the DVD opens with distance/angling training and basic blocking.  There is some discussion about avoidance scattered throughout the production.  If the viewer is paying close attention they will even find some discussion about realizing the wielders abilities based on their handling of the weapon.

Lastly, in agreement with another reviewer's comment, I'm not exactly sure why the phrase ""Traditional"" is used in the title.  The techniques are ""traditional"" in that they come from a ""traditional"" style of Chinese martial art.  However, that does beg the question, what exactly is a non-traditional technique?  Although techniques using common objects are presented, I would have like some inclusion of techniques using a stick or staff, whether they be of ""traditional"" origin or otherwise.  Perhaps viewers could anticipate a future YMAA release on knife defense using weapons!",1320624000,3,2978,5.361290322580645
8460658,5,B0057G0JS0,"Throughout the years, I've sought training surrounding the topic of knife fighting and defense.  The theory goes, and I'll have to agree with it, is that the person who will actually use a knife against you is definitely crossing a line and making it very personal as compared to a gun.  While a firearm is definitely more legal and able to be used at more of a distance, a knife is very intimate and personal.

As such, all empty-hand techniques work, with very little modification whether there is a knife or no knife present.  It's easy to be lulled into a false sense of security with you don't see a knife to be lax or not in a condition of absolute attention.  As such, I like to train with a training knife in my partner's hand to make sure I keep the proper amount of distance whether there is a knife present or not.

I will have to say that the techniques, philosophy, demonstrations and teaching Dr Yang puts into this video will give enough material for several months of practice and teaching at my school.  I haven't been disappointed with any of his previous work, and I'm not disappointed in this material either.  Dr Yang approaches self defense / martial science wit the same calm and peaceful demeanor as a Jedi.

Dr Yang is truly a wonderful teacher and an asset to have on my video shelf.",1317859200,,1309,4.466386554621849
