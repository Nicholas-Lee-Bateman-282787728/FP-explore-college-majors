8279757,5,B001AUKUX6,"This is a great workout for getting ready for the slopes.  It goes as a good pace - not too slow and is very easy to follow.  There are a variety of workouts offered - pre-slope, overall and Apre's ski.  I have been using it everyday and have seen the results!  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to become for flexible and get stronger before getting out into the winter sport of your choice.",1384473600,,399,4.28
8279758,5,B001AUKUX6,"I am an intermediate skier and a one-year ski instructor in Pennsylvania. I twisted my knee last year while skiing out west. My hamstrings muscle have always given me a problem so after my injury, I starting searching for a professional yoga instructor that specialized in skiing. Billy Asad has met and exceeded what I was looking for. In fact, my husband who has been skiing for 25 years and also a ski instructor for 7, has joined me in front of the tv once a week to do yoga. It's make a difference in our strength and flexibility along with yoga moves for when we are away enjoying the snow. I would definately recommend this video to anyone who loves sports.",1348099200,2,664,4.450819672131147
8279759,5,B001AUKUX6,I purchased this dvd having a yoga and pilates background.  I had a horrible first experience skiing and thought that this dvd might help me train the correct muscles needed for this difficult sport.  It is a good and relaxing workout that stretches the muscles that are used during skiing.  I felt much more confident in getting back into skis after using this dvd.,1293840000,3,366,4.6875
8279760,5,B001AUKUX6,"I'm a beginner skier who was injured last season, wants to return to the slopes next season and wants to be a better skier.  I'm also an avid yoga practitioner.  I was personally putting together a yoga sequence for skiing and running when I came across this new DVD recently.  Frankly, I was quite skeptical at buying it as I've seen a number of ""Yoga for ..."" or ""Weight training for ..."" that were complete wastes of money.  I'm happy to report that Sports Yoga Ski is different.

The yoga sequence consists of poses intended to strengthen, stretch and work out the lower body, abs and hip areas that are necessary to ski (which here, will include snowboarding).  It is not presented in a hurried flow, but in a peaceful, unhurried and relaxed style, which both calmed my mind and allowed me to focus on the poses.  It also has a short sequence for after-ski stretching, which I just absolutely love.

Billy Asad's instructions are clear and simple.  His voice is quite and soothing.  There are no yoga philosophical musings, as the focus of the DVD is skiing, not getting deeper into yoga. His short introduction does not have the usual yoga spiel, and goes right down to business - how yoga can help your skiing.  As the title suggests, this DVD is all about the physical aspect of yoga. If you are expecting some yogic insights or mantras, you will be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are serious athlete who wants a sports-oriented yoga practice, you won't be disappointed.  Any athlete (skier or not) will benefit from this DVD.

In fact, you don't have to be an athlete to appreciate this DVD.  The program is neither easy nor difficult and so is suitable for beginners.  I recommend this to any beginner who is for a beginner's program to get him and keep him going.  As mentioned earlier, the instructions are given clearly.  In addition, the movements are made unhurriedly and with precision without looking robotic or stunted.  The camera angles show you how the poses are supposed to look like.  While the camera is not static and changes angles, I did not have occasion to complain ""I can't see what the heck I'm supposed to do"".

I also liked the music.  It's not obtrusive, not the typical music of Hindi/African/Arabic origin.

The setting is in front of a fireplace in a ski lodge.  I can just imagine myself up on the slopes.  The images of skiing and snowboarding are awesome and inspiring.

I do have a couple of minor comments.  First, I found some of the poses too short (such as chair pose), that is I would have preferred to stay in those poses a few seconds longer to benefit from the pose.  Second, I think that the plank and upward facing dog should have been included.",1228348800,12,2706,4.58125
8279761,5,B001AUKUX6,"Billy Asad is a wonderful teacher.  This DVD is much anticipated, I'm looking forward to watching it for the first time!",1221523200,,120,4.714285714285714
8279762,5,B001AUKUX6,"What a great video to warm up for the slopes.  Skiing works my quads hard, and this video got me ready more than any warm up i've done before.",1220140800,2,142,3.896551724137931
8279763,5,B001AUKUX6,"I'm a big skier so I wanted to try this. I do the power workout on its own, or the stretching chapter after other sports--bicycling, tennis, running. The stretches are great to keep me from tightening up after the running. I love it!",1219881600,5,233,4.441860465116279
