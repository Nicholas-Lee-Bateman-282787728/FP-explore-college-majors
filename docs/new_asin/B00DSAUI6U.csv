8597062,4,B00DSAUI6U,"The first video covers eye witness account by the survivors and in North Africa where it happened. The other videos are docs made years ago and there is some repeat of footage although each one adds different details.  The videos run beginning to end unlike some more recent series produced for the TV market (22-24 minute segments like some other docs I have)
