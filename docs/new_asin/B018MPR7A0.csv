8742641,4,B018MPR7A0,This was a pretty good representation of Tong Bei Kung Fu.  I think the guy knows his stuff.  To be expert at Tong Bei you really have to be relaxed and you have to be able to reeeach  your target with long arms.  This DVD accomplishes that.  This is a basic Tong Bei but if you don't get the basics down pat it's hard to go to the next level.  This DVD by itself is a very good start to Tong Bei which is very fast and explosive.  You can tell the instructor is passionate about Tong Bei and that he wants his students to be experts in this awesome form of martial arts.,1453766400,3,571,3.956140350877193
