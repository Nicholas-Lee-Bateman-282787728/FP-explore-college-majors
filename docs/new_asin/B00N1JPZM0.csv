6606801,5,B00N1JPZM0,"** UPDATE:  What this set has.. Three discs are double sided, with 2 ep's on either side. The 2013 movie is the fourth disc. Although all 12 episodes are not listed on the back, they are there (the titles only go by every other episode: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). To be absolutely sure, I've done the math: 42 minute average runtime, multiplied by 12= 504 minutes, add 89 minutes for the 2013 movie= 593.  There is a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette on each side of the disc 3-4 min's long per one. The stated runtime is 601 minutes. I chose this set, for the fact that it DOES contain subtitles (English & Spanish).

It was also stated on the FB fanpage (""Fan's of Hallmark's When Calls The Heart""), that the difference between this set and the US Hallmark aired episodes is that there are a few scenes only aired in Canada.  Conversely, there have also been a few scenes they cut from these sets that DID air on Hallmark.

So, if you wish to have both sets you will need to look for the 10 disc set by Word Films (via Fish Flix, Family Christian, and eBay), or here: http://www.amazon.com/When-Calls-Heart-Complete-Season/dp/B00PMC6M12/
Discs 1-6 are two episodes a piece (aka ""the movies""), then the 2013 movie on disc 7, and the remaining discs are episodes 1-12 again, ""as seen on Hallmark"" channel.  But there are NO subtitles.

For more information please check out: HeartiesWCTH.com , the official ""When Calls The Heart"" (TV Show) FB page, as well as the FB ""closed group"" fanpage: ""Fan's of Hallmark's When Calls The Heart"").**

Now to my review...

First off, I haven't read any of the Janette Oke book series this show is named after (although from what I've read, it's not actually based on the namesake's lead characters, but rather a new book spin-off entitled ""Where Courage Calls"").
However, I have seen the movie (the lead actors are different than the series, except for Lori Loughlin).

**Semi-spoiler:  As some fans may already know, the ""movie"", that was a sort of lead in to the series, ends rather abruptly (the runtime is about equal to 2 episodes).  There's also two separate storylines going, so unfortunately there's not much time for either to get very far.  Being the 2 leads had to be recast for the show, they sort of had to rewrite ""Elizabeth's"" entry into ""Coal Valley"".  Also the mountie is not named ""Edward"", but rather ""Jack"", and so he has a different history than the movie's mountie.**

My initial impression/review of ep's 1-4, was a 4 star rating. But I'm giving the entire season 5 stars, because I feel that the story lines from episodes 5-12 really take off! Actually, some of the best moments of the season are in those episodes (ep's 9 & 12 are especially phenomenal)!!!
This is my first experience with either lead actor (well, technically Miss Krakow appeared in 1 episode of a show I watch, but I can't recall her performance).
I'm especially amazed at how well Mr. Lissing can conceal his accent, which I'm sure can't be easy! Also, the chemistry between the leads seems to flow naturally, and doesn't feel contrived (despite the fact their characters get off to a rough start).

If I'm being totally honest, there are a few over dramatic, and somewhat predictable moments (*slight SPOILER*: for instance when the hero ""Jack"" is ALWAYS there to save the day-- seriously, pretty soon they're going to have to sew an ""S"" onto his uniform because he's the Edwardian version of ""Clark Kent""!).
But really, what does that matter when each episode has an underlying positive message, AND it's clean family friendly entertainment (a rarity these days)?!

It's definitely reminiscent of ""Christy"" (one of my favorite, but sadly short-lived TV series in the mid 90's), ""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"", and perhaps a little of ""Anne of Green Gables"", or ""Little House on the Prairie"".
My one real complaint, is that music is constantly being played during much of the dialogue and it competes with their voices (so unless you have closed caption on, you might have to replay it, and/or constantly adjust the volume)! Unfortunately, other Hallmark productions have this problem too...

I conclusion, I highly recommend this for anyone who loves this genre, or are who are simply looking for something decent for the whole family to watch!

**Thankfully Hallmark has renewed this series for a second season. However, filming commenced in November, and the premier date is April 25, 2015 (8/7 pm CT.). It's unfortunate that a new series takes precedence for an earlier release instead of ""WCtH"", which should start the same time as it did this year (Jan.).  But at least we have another season to look forward to! And the cast, & official FB page keeps us updated on all the latest info!**",1414713600,258,4719,4.7680981595092025
6606802,5,B00N1JPZM0,"It has been decades since a series has captivated my intrigue the same way as ""When Calls The Heart""!  What a joy to experience this story depicted by extremely gifted and believable actors!  I especially appreciate the integrity of the characters in our world filled with an acceptance of immorality and coarse language.  I applaud the pleasure of watching each drama unfold yet maintaining an uplifting and somewhat playful experience throughout.  I am hopeful that there are many more seasons to come.",1414627200,22,504,5.109756097560975
6606803,5,B00N1JPZM0,This is the best series that has been out in a very long time! I've watch each episode over and over and never get tired of it. The story has such depth and meaning.

6606837,5,B00N1JPZM0,"Excellent!  Family friendly and heart warming!  Enjoyed watching it with my 10 yr old granddaughter and my 79 yr old mother.  Good, clean entertainment.",1521072000,,152,5.25
6606838,4,B00N1JPZM0,"The discs come in a plastic snap case. The discs play fine.

You'll like When Calls the Heart if you like any of the following: Anne of Green Gables (1985), Anne of Green Gable the Sequel (1987), Ann of Avonlea (1975), or Anne with an E (2017- ). All of these series are great family shows, safe for viewers of all ages. You don't have to worry about sex scenes, swearing, or excessive violence.

If you're looking for other good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,1848,5.519434628975265

6607147,4,B00N1JPZM0,"This is an excellent series of a story set against the rough Western front at a time when families were struggling to sustain themselves in a 19th century coal mining town.  However, although I enjoyed the series, I have to give it four stars because, as a hard of hearing viewer, they are less enjoyable when I can't understand what anyone is saying because I can't lipread as they move around.  With today's DVDs having the requirements of having closed captions or subtitles available, it was a bitter disappointment not to find this option in When Calls the Heart.  I bought these DVDs because I enjoyed them on Hallmark and wanted to watch them again; I have even been thinking of buying the following seasons - but the missing subtitles are what make me hesitate.  Please fix all your DVDs and fit them with this option so we can enjoy them more!",1483228800,3,852,4.5855263157894735

I know the budgets are lower, but to see a modern pair of 'dickie' pants hanging on the clothes line for a 3 minutes or more scene just bugs me.  There were many more cheap things but I am one that notices everything...",1467504000,,311,4.254237288135593
6607218,4,B00N1JPZM0,"I don't know who wrote the product description for this film, but season one of When Calls the Heart was not set in the 19th century. It was actually set towards the end of the Edwardian period in 1910.

With this being said, fans of From Lark Rise to Candleford or Downton Abbey will love this series ... but there are a few detractors.

Costuming was apparently a huge challenge for wardrobe. The clothing worn by the women appears to be vintage inspired rather than being period appropriate. Where are the puffed sleeves, the high collars, and the poise that can only come from wearing a corset? Where are the layered petticoats and why do so many women wear their hair down?

In 1910 only girls wore their hair down ... typically in a single plait or tied off with a ribbon. Grown women wore their hair up in pompadours that were tied off in buns or knots. They also wore elaborate wide brimmed hats. Even though this story line is set in rural Canada, respectable women would still have worn some sort of hat.

This series also has the Mounties wearing red serge jackets. The red serge is distinctly picturesque which is probably why wardrobe used it but in 1904 the red jackets worn by the Mounties were (largely) replaced with tunics that were either dark blue or brown. By 1920 the red serge was only worn as part of a dress uniform.

Although this series starts with the arrival of a new teacher in a mining town which had recently suffered a tragic mishap in which 46 miners lost their lives, none of the women appear to have been dressed for mourning. According to the customs of the period, widows were expected to mourn their husbands for anywhere between 18 months and 2 years. They did this by wearing black dresses and black hats or bonnets with black veils. Even allowing for the fact that poor women in a coal mining town would not have had the means to replace their wardrobes, they would at least have sewn black crepe trimmings onto their clothing. Widows were expected to voluntarily seclude themselves from the community (outside of close friends and family) but these mourning customs were clearly not followed in Coal Valley.

In addition to having a Mountie, Coal valley had a force of Pinkertons who acted as company police. Although the Pinkertons were famous for having been early detectives, they also provided uniformed security officers, though these officers were primarily engaged by railroad companies. In Episode 10, Jack asked the Pinkertons for their assistance in apprehending a notorious outlaw gang. The Pinkertons refused citing their contracts as company officers.

Had these been real Pinkerton officers, they would not have refused Jack's request. One of the reasons that the Pinkerton Detective Agency became so popular was because their men were above reproach. In 1850 the Pinkerton Code was adopted. Under this code, officers would not accept bribes or reward money. They would not compromise with criminals. They would always COOPERATE with law enforcement.

Had the events in this story unfolded in real life, it is unlikely they would have refused to work with the Mounties. I also cannot see them cast in the role of thugs who hopped and wielded their truncheons everytime the company boss (Henry Gowen) barked an order.

With this being said, I think the shortfall in historical inaccuracies can be forgiven given the richness and depth of the characters in this series. Erin Krakow as Elizabeth Thatcher, plays a convincing role as a teacher from a privileged family who has to adapt to life in a rural town. Lori Loughlin as Abigail Stanton, is a widow who is the unofficial leader of the wives in Coal Valley. She is the voice of compassion for this community and steadfastly offers compassion and support to anyone in need of assistance.

Even if wardrobe had done a top notch job with the costuming, this series would not have amounted to anything without decent writers and actors and actresses who could play their respective roles. It is for this reason that I give this series four stars and a proverbial thumbs up despite the historical inaccuracies.",1467158400,5,4114,4.806223479490806

6607371,1,B00N1JPZM0,"I love the movie. Its great - Michael Landon did a wonderful job but whoever created this DVD set did a terrible job. I received this set for Christmas, watched the first 6 dvd's, then when I get to dvd 7 it is ""Pilot Movie"".... um, what?! Shouldn't that be the first movie?! Why would I care to watch Elizabeth's start when I already know she is doing fine according to the first 6 dvd's. Then I check out Amazon Reviews, to see what is going on with all the last 3 dvd's in my set labeled ""Episodes 1-12"" because I was thinking I had a few more hours of WCTH to watch.... Wrong. They are just what I had watched, with the expectation of all the wonderful scenes that I missed :-(  I would have loved to watched those extra scenes but the idea of spending hours re watching everything is ridiculous... Because of all this I am done with this show. We do not have cable and if I can not order a ""Compete Season"" that is put together with a little common sense and organizational skills then I will not bother wasting anymore of my time or money. I will miss you Elizabeth and Jack!!!",1451865600,4,1083,4.206730769230769

There are many lessons for us all about living an honorable life while pursuing a noble purpose. Elizabeth is a great role model for today's women, because she maintains her dignity and goes on with her career while Mountie Jack finds himself drawn to her.

Most notably, Jack takes the high road and allows Elizabeth to save face after he was proven right about a bad guy. As a gentleman of integrity, Jack is a great role model for men everywhere.",1444521600,,584,4.782178217821782

6607400,5,B00N1JPZM0,"Best TV series ever!  I have watched the whole series at least 7 times.  Great character development.  Watch the relationship grow between Elizabeth and Jack starting from distain and animosity to interest to love.  As Jack fumbled his interactions with Elizabeth, I would think how much better I would have handled the situation, then I look back on my life and realize I made the same mistakes.  So the authenticity is there.  Elizabeth does an excellent job in projecting her budding feelings for Jack.  Great facial expressions and subtle eye movements that convey deep feelings.  Jack is awkward in engaging with Elizabeth as men are often to be.  There are a lot of twists and turns, which put the relationship to the test.  Love the scenery.  Can't wait for my Season 2 DVDs to arrive (I missed the shows on TV, not finding out about this gem until after Season 2).  Nice decent programing without the profanity and all the other crud on regular TV.

Upon watching these and realizing there must be a back story that we hadn't seen, I hopped on-line and found there was a whole first season I needed to catch up on.  So I ordered it and had it shipped right away.  I am totally hooked on this.  I love the time-period, the story-lines, and the mountie!  It's a great combination without the language and smut that pervade much of today's television.  Can't wait for the newest season to come out to buy (I've already pre-ordered).

6607535,4,B00N1JPZM0,The show has good acting and great scenery but the writing leaves me wondering.  For example why is Gowen still around and now he's the mayor? It was proven that he helped 47 men die in the town.  Now he is still around trying feebly to make more trouble.  Very bad writing.  Write him out and focus on something more enlightening.  The actor also leaves me cold.  He has only one expression that is suppose to be threatening looking but comes off rather comical.  Stay focused on why Elizabeth wanted to stay in town and help these children who have little chance in making it in the world. Focus on them and what they learn and accomplish.  To me the story really excels when its fine humane intent comes forth.  Its about people who have to struggle to exist.  Show how Elizabeth and others help to make this happen.  This is what all good literature is about  rising above one's circumstances and excelling beyond what can be expected.,1435104000,,939,4.523809523809524

4 potential couples plus a basic situation in a small mining town  Gossip, criminals, jealousies abound in a former mining town, now to be a

Or rather, I forced my way through two and a half episodes before I just couldn't stomach any more.  I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who love this series - just look at all the 5-star reviews - but as much as I wanted to, I just couldn't like it.

The novel is one of my favorite books EVER.  I've read it over and over.  The plot, the characters, the story line - I love every bit of it.  Elizabeth is one of my favorite heroins and Wynn is the standard to which I held mankind for a long time lol.  To have their characters and their story so butchered and twisted out of place as to leave them unrecognizeable is, in my mind, a travesty.  I will NOT be adding this series to my DVD collection.

6607586,2,B00N1JPZM0,"While all of Jeanette Oke's books and inspired movies obviously cater primarily to a faith-based audience, I found this to pale in comparison to the far superior Love Comes Softly movies. The acting is ok but the series is rife with historical inaccuracies. For one, in turn-of-century parlance, it would've been considered ""unseemly"" for a young, unattached woman to spend so much time in the company of an officer of the law - unchaperoned, no less. The double entendre and obvious flirting are equally out of place. Moreover, the entire series is replete with uncharacteristic bantering and interactions between both genders that, decades before the suffragette movement gave women the vote for the first time, is completely at odds with how women and men would have interacted at that time in history.

One of the things I found especially distasteful - if not entirely unpredictable - was depicting the ruthless mining company owner as a godless crook who eschews safety in favor of profit and, in a verbal showdown with the town's pastor (who had been on his payroll and suddenly has an epiphany - how cliche!), makes his faithlessness clear by responding to the pastor's scripture quote with ""I don't speak bible."". This crass and distasteful portrayal - obviously designed to equate atheism with callous, calculating selfishness and profiteering - is quite frankly as offensive as it is transparent.

Overall, I can see why some people would enjoy this but, personally, I watched this only because of the fact that I absolutely loved the movie adaptations with Katherine Heigl and found this to be falling short of my expectations.",1432080000,,1639,5.066666666666666

There is an amazing chemistry between the two leads of Erin Krakow and Daniel Lissing. Lori Loughlin is a delight in the show as sorta the town matriarch. Its even got Jack Wagner now. The children in the show are fantastic little actors and they add so much to this show. The show has humor as well and its clean, family viewing as well. it sorta reminds me a bit of Little House on the Prairie only the time period is about 35-40 years later.

  The story of a pioneering school teacher attempting to take on the position of educator in a mining town called Coal Valley, heartwarming stories about the human quest for life  that give you hope for today's generation, this is what good Television should be all about, something you can have your children watch without the fear of mental corruption.

6607768,2,B00N1JPZM0,"This is a wonderful series.  Can't say anything bad about the movie.  You need to know that the Televison Movie Collection Version is cheaper and does contain all of the movies.  The difference is that this set has all of the 6 movies on seperate DVD's and also the movie by Michael Landon,Jr. which inspired the series.  This set also contains the movies broken into 12 episodes as shown on TV.  So, 6 movies equal 12 episodes.  This set has 2 copies in it of the movie.  It is redundant and unnecessary for my house hold use.  The first DVD containing the episodes includes  ""Get To Know"" Michael Landon, Jr and Janette Okey and this  is not found in the Television Movie Collection Version.  This and the fact that the TMCV is only a 4 disc set with the movie series on both sides of the DVD is the only difference  between the 2 sets.  Except I guess for price.  I know because I have both DVD's in front of me and the Television Movie Collection Version which  I bought at Christmas time was $19.99.  Under the impression that it was not complete, and because my children love is,  I bought this version on Ebay for $50.00 and I will be selling it ASAP.",1422057600,69,1158,4.336448598130841

6607801,5,B00N1JPZM0,"Complete 1st Season: 12 episodes coupled into 6 movie length pairs. Plus you get the feature film that inspired the series. All of the same title as the Janette Oke book; and filled with the excellence of Hallmark Channel. A 1910 period, west of the Canadian Rockies, small mining town with a recent disaster. 46 miners dead, and the event needs looking into, just as an eastern gal accepts the Coal Valley teaching job. Canadian answer to Oke's ""Love Comes Softly"" another hit book/film combo.

Downside? Packaging reduced to 4 discs. One the feature film; 3 are the series with 2 episodes married into one with both sides of the discs being used. It's potential for disc damage, but if handled carefully will last a lifetime, and the stories make the risk worth it.
Can't say anything bad about the content, even though some say bits were removed (to make it all fit). Yes, there is another ongoing season, eventually to be on DVD. Strong cast ability, including a number of youth, will keep this series worthwhile. Cinematography is fabulous. Plots and dialogue writing period believable.

SDH SUBTITLES provided for this set.
Watch the 2013 film first, the only disc with the printed label. It introduces the series with a different cast. It was directed/written by Michael Landon Jr. who also had much to do with the 2014 series. It's all delightful safe FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT. Historical period educational. It could just as easily been set in PA or WV coalmine area.

The 2014 series: overviews not spoilers.
Episodes use only the 1st title of 2 episodes combined for each disc side.
Disc 1, side A -`Lost and Found' with `Cease and Desist'--As final bodies are carried from the mine a message is found. Eviction is threatened the widows from mine-owned housing.
1-B -`A Telling Silence' with ""Secrets and Lies""--A lost mute child and Coal Valley church mystery arson.
2-A--`The Dance' with `These Games'--New miners, all single, catch the ladies eyes, leading up to the ""Miner's Dance."" ""The Miners' Games"" are fun, but not the burglaries.
2-B--`Second Chances' with `Perils of the Soloists'--New chance for teacher, student, & widow. School teacher directs the student Founders' Day play.
3-A--`Change of Heart' with `Love Comes First'--Romance, relocation, conflict, and then an injured hunter's secret is unraveled.
3-B--`Rules of Engagement' with `Prelude to a Kiss'--2 new town arrivals turn commerce & love on its head. Plenty of ends untied, and introductions of new cast to keep this series going well for the next season.

Some of Janette Oke's best adaptation.",1421020800,4,2577,5.042253521126761

The television version is a little different from the books but the warmth and character identification remain the same.

You can skip the movie that comes with the Season 1 DVD set......it is a stinker. But you don't need it in order to enjoy the television series.",1417824000,13,521,4.725274725274725

The stories of the other townspeople are artfully weaved in- amazing cast!  I can'tell wait for Season 2!  You will get the complete first season as well as When Calls the Heart the movie that came out before the series.  But the TV series was better in my opinion!,1417219200,,440,4.382716049382716
6607865,4,B00N1JPZM0,"I would give the TV series five stars based on content (cast, plot, costumes, sets, quality), but the DVD set itself causes me to adjust my rating down a little. The series itself is wonderful. The main cast members have wonderful chemistry, the stories are heartwarming without being too cheesy and preachy, and this easily qualifies as entertainment the whole family can watch and enjoy. The flow of the series is good, with a main story that runs fairly consistently in the first season, and supporting stories along the way. The development of the love story between the two main characters is lovely. Jack and Elizabeth's story is nice in that they are independent people but they challenge each other and change and grow because of each other. The chemistry between the two main actors really anchors the series and they simply light up the screen when they share it. There are cliches at times but they are well executed and somehow fitting to the time and place.

The organization of the set is what causes me to scratch my head a little. The set includes the terrible original TV movie and all 12 episodes of the first season. The about 45 minute episodes are grouped into two episodes to equal an approximate 90 minute ""movie,"" which explains the billing of it as six movies. The DVDs of the series itself are double sided and poorly marked, with very small text in the center telling you which movie is on the A and B sides of the disc. But this does make for fewer DVDs and a more compact set, and likely brings the cost down. For some reason at the start of each DVD there is the same 13 minutes of previews. It's easy to skip them, but strange to have the same content in front of each disc and makes for an added, unnecessary step.

Special features are somewhat few. Each movie episode has the movie (two episodes) and a short featurette. The featurettes are focused on the making of the show, casting, and brief behind the scenes interviews. They are nice to see, but incredibly short and just leave you wanting more (more interviews, bloopers, deleted scenes - more on that in a bit). As for deleted scenes, they have done something clever. In the episodes I've watched on the DVDs there appear to be a handful of either extended or deleted scenes that have been added back into the episodes themselves, different from the original episodes. This actually makes those scenes seamless additions and there are some nice ones.

But here's one thing I don't get. At least one episode (the last in the season), actually had a scene MISSING. I originally downloaded the episodes from iTunes so I can't speak to the original broadcast, but there is an entire scene, and a somewhat pivotal one at that, gone from the last episode/movie. And for the life of me I can't figure out why. It seems like an odd choice to add in deleted or extended scenes in other places but then take out at least one scene from the episode. It makes it so there are different versions out there and it either makes me think there is a reason (why I don't know) or someone just wasn't paying attention when they put this set together.

But in the end the negatives don't detract from what a wonderful show this is. Having the episodes on DVD is great, the $20 price tag is decent, and the episodes themselves stand up on their own. I just wish someone had been paying a little more attention to the organization and content, and more special features would have been nice.",1417046400,96,3460,4.557877813504823
6607866,5,B00N1JPZM0,"**For an in depth comparison of this set by Word Films, and the Millenium 4 disc (double sided) ""Complete Movie Set"", please see the additional info at the end of my review!**

First off, I haven't read any of the Janette Oke book series this show is named after (although from what I've read, it's not actually based on the namesake's lead characters, but rather a new book spin-off entitled ""Where Courage Calls"").
But I have seen the 2013 movie *which is included in both sets*.  (FYI, the lead actors are different than the series, except for Lori Loughlin).

**Semi-spoiler: As some fans may already know, the ""movie"", that was a sort of lead in to the series, ends rather abruptly (the runtime is about equal to 2 episodes). There's also two separate storylines going, so unfortunately there's not much time for either to get very far. Being the 2 leads had to be recast for the show, they sort of had to rewrite ""Elizabeth's"" entry into ""Coal Valley"". Also the mountie is not named ""Edward"", but rather ""Jack"", and so he has a different history than the movie's mountie.**

My initial impression/review of ep's 1-4, was a 4 star rating. But I'm giving the entire season 5 stars, because I feel that the story lines from episodes 5-12 really take off! Actually, some of the best moments of the season are in those episodes (ep's 9 & 12 are especially phenomenal)!!!
This is my first experience with either lead actor (well, technically Miss Krakow appeared in 1 episode of a show I watch, but I can't recall her performance).
I'm especially amazed at how well Mr. Lissing can conceal his accent, which I'm sure can't be easy! Also, the chemistry between the leads seems to flow naturally, and doesn't feel contrived (despite the fact their characters get off to a rough start).

If I'm being totally honest, there are a few over dramatic, and somewhat predictable moments.  For instance the hero ""Jack"" is ALWAYS there to save the day-- seriously, pretty soon they're going to have to sew an ""S"" onto his uniform because he's the Edwardian version of ""Clark Kent""!
But really, what does that matter when each episode has an underlying positive message, AND it's clean family friendly entertainment (a rarity these days)?!

It's definitely reminiscent of ""Christy"" (one of my favorite, but sadly short-lived TV series in the mid 90's), ""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"", and perhaps a little of ""Anne of Green Gables"", or ""Little House on the Prairie"".
My one real complaint, is that music is constantly being played during much of the dialogue and it competes with their voices (so unless you have closed caption on, you might have to replay it, and/or constantly adjust the volume)! Unfortunately, other Hallmark productions have this problem too...

I conclusion, I highly recommend this for anyone who loves this genre, or are who are simply looking for something decent for the whole family to watch!

Thankfully Hallmark has renewed this series for a second season. However, filming commenced in November, and the premier date is April 25, 2015 (8/7 pm. CT). It's unfortunate that a new series takes precedence for a Jan. release instead of ""WCtH"", which should start the same time as it did this year (Jan.). But at least we have another season to look forward to! And the cast, & official FB page keeps us updated on all the latest info!

**Just to clarify, here's the difference between the Word Films (10 disc) set, and the less expensive Millenium Entertainment 4 disc ""movie set""**

This set by Word Films: Discs 1-6 are two episodes a piece (aka the ""movies""), then the 2013 movie on disc 7, and the remaining discs are episodes 1-12 ""as seen on Hallmark"" channel.  There are NO subtitles on this set.

It was also stated on the FB fanpage (""Fans of Hallmark's When Calls The Heart""), that the difference between the 2 episode ""movie"" discs (1-6 discs on Word Films, and all the ep's appearing on Millenium Entertainment's ""movie set""), and the episodes as aired on the Hallmark network, are a few scenes only aired in Canada. Conversely, there have also been a few scenes they cut from these sets that DID air on Hallmark.

Millennium's (""movie"") set: Three discs are double sided, with 2 ep's on either side. The 2013 movie is the fourth disc. Although all 12 episodes are not listed on the back, they are there (the titles only go by every other episode: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). To be absolutely sure, I've done the math: 42 minute average runtime, multiplied by 12= 504 minutes, add 89 minutes for the 2013 movie= 593.  There is a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette on each side of the disc 3-4 min's long per one. The stated runtime is 601 minutes. I chose this set, for the fact that it DOES contain subtitles (English & Spanish).

So, if you want the bonus scenes, and the original Hallmark scenes, the 10 disc set is going to have everything. Except caption that is!

(I can't say how many added & deleted scenes there are total, and how much they impact the storyline.)

Other than as a marketing ploy, I personally don't understand why either distributor had to complicate things this way. What they should have done is added the extra scenes the Canadian viewers saw under bonus material. And give the option for subtitles. Then fans wouldn't have to be torn between either set.

One final note:  The current price for the 10 disc set is running $59.99.  Should you decide on this set, it is cheaper on other websites such as ""FishFlix"", (you may even want to check eBay, as I've seen them cropping up there).
""Family Christian"" was selling a companion cook booklet with dvd set as well.",1416960000,116,5611,4.705102040816326
