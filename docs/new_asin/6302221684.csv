436780,3,6302221684,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM. I have only seen the Japanese version, and that's not the same thing at all. The excisement of a full 20 minutes in any film is an absolute travesty, but in a movie of such complexity crammed into a fairly short space of time, every single scene and line of dialogue carries huge weight, both in terms of plot and character development. Having been told some of the scenes which were removed, I can tell you that Warriors of the Wind is a beautiful, stunningly animated film, with compelling music and characters, which feels incomplete and rushed. Also the end post credits image, if it was retained, will make no sense at all. Which is a shame, because complete it is one of the most powerful images in any film I have ever seen. As I said, the 1984 animation stands up well to anything around today (Seriously, it's stunning), the music is lovely but the cuts and cuts and the rest of the cuts stop me from giving it 5 stars. And they changed Nausicaa's name to Zandra. That is unforgivable.",1005955200,9,1021,4.4361702127659575
436781,5,6302221684,"I saw this movie when I was very young, and I only realized that it was anime a few weeks ago! It was one of my favorite videos of all time. The parts of it I could remember were fantastic.",987292800,2,189,3.75
436839,3,6302221684,"Sorry but all the critics slamming Warriors of the Wind are overly critical. Watch this cute animation until you get a chance to see the original Nausicaa. Nausicaa is great, but it doesn't justify measuring everything by it. My guess is most families may still prefer this version since it is less violent and sexual than many Anime movies. Rent it if you can still find it. This has become hard to find. I hope it comes out on DVD

I think the nice thing about Warriors of the Wind was it didn't seem as serious and therefore can be enjoyed by a younger audience as well. Did it copy from other stories? Maybe, but then a number of movies have copied from somthing else. I don't recall seeing Nausicaa at my video store when I first rented this in the 80s so my family has enjoyed this movie for many years. I'm glad this movie doesn't have the adult relationships and bloody killings seen in many animated movies.",1074556800,4,916,4.420118343195266
436840,1,6302221684,"Studio Gihbli, who created the original Nausica of the Valley of the Wind has asked us to forget this horrible hack job ever existed.  The writer/director Miyazaki was extremely upset when he saw this video.  As I write this (11/3) the new English dub by Disney is in production and will hopefully be available in the US soon.  The new dub will be true to the original and will show it in it's full glory.  Please wait for it's release.  It'll be worth it.",1069027200,19,456,4.380952380952381
436841,5,6302221684,"The five star rating is not for the English language version of this film, but for the original though subtitled Japanese version.  My hope is that with the Oscar that SPIRITED AWAY won, following the enormous success of PRINCESS MONONOKE, Disney will bring out a new and unbutchered version of this great, great Miyazaki classic.

Hayao Miyazaki may finally be on the verge of being commonly recognized in the United States as the world's greatest animator.  For years I have been hawking his genius to friends and acquaintances, few of whom recognized his name.  Several knew MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO or KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, but were unaware that they were by the same person.  But with the growing realization in America that all these great, great films, far surpassing the entire output of Disney in quality and originality, are all by the same creative genius, Miyazaki is finally getting the recognition that he truly deserves.

NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, to give WARRIORS OF THE WIND its proper title, is one of Miyazaki's greatest films, and one that shows most clearly his preoccupation with ecological concerns (the butchered American version eliminates much of this).  As in all of his films, the quality of the animation is scarcely to be believed.  The only non-Miyazaki film that renders trees and forests as well is the opening sequences of BAMBI.  And as in most of his films, Miyazaki, unlike the Disney habit of almost always updating some classic tale, creates a completely original and previously untold story.  He is not merely a cartoonish:  he is an original storyteller.

Even in its heavily edited American form, WARRIORS OF THE WIND retains a degree of the power of NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND.  When my daughter was in kindergarten, at a time when she was acutely aware of a paucity of strong female role models, she would watch this film over and over.  Two movies seems to provide her with better female role models than any others, this film and THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN.  Many other movies delighted her, but these two made her feel that the world was a place for girls who with things they wanted to accomplish as well, that women, and not only men and boys, could be heroes as well.

With such Miyazaki films as CASTLE IN THE SKY and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE getting a first rate release on DVD in the US, one can hope that NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND wouldn't be far behind.  The big difference between those films and the latter is that they were not especially altered when first produced in English version, while NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND was dramatically altered.  For a new dubbed version, Disney will need to first restore all of the cut scenes from the American original, and then produce a new soundtrack.  In other words, bringing NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND to the American market anew will require more work than on any of Miyazaki's other films.  But the work will definitely need to be justified by the produce, which is one of Miyazaki's finest films.  I wonder if before bringing it out on DVD, they might not bring a newly reproduced film to theaters first.  Whatever their decision, there does seem to be significant reason for optimism that we might finally get the opportunity to hear and see this film in the way that Miyazaki wanted us to see it.

FEBRUARY 2005 addition:  We got it!  In the ongoing rerelease of all of Miyazaki's films on DVD, this one has been fully restored and redubbed.  I just ordered my copy!",1052352000,40,3510,4.694444444444445

436843,3,6302221684,"As others have mentioned, Warriors of the Wind is a shortened version of Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind.  I have both versions of this movie on VHS, & even though I grew up loving Warriors, once I saw Nausicaa, I knew I had been robbed of seeing a great movie all my life.  Nausicaa contains scenes that were cut, for whatever reason from Warriors.  I was in shock when I saw the complete version last year, because I never knew that there was so much I had never seen.  If you really want to enjoy this film, I strongly urge you to get Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind.  I know that Ebay has at least one full page of Hayao Miyazaki auctions, not only for Nausicaa.  I own several of his titles, & I have not been disappointed yet.",1038096000,5,730,4.141843971631205
436844,4,6302221684,"The Japanese are obsessed with the destruction of the planet or so it would seem from many of their anime movies.  In ""Warriors of the Wind"", we are in a post-apocalyptic Earth of the future.  There's the ""Toxic Jungle"" were insects have grown to monstrous sizes, various wastelands, and the beautiful Valley of the Wind where the story starts.
The story is pretty good (though I understand this VHS version has been seriously edited and a bunch has been cut from this release...typical movie industry actions back then because we Americans are to dumb to understand things).  The animation is good and the voice-acting isn't bad.  The only part I didn't like was the constant leftist preaching that goes on about the planet.  It seems to come into play frequently which annoyed me a bit, but not enough to stop watching this movie nor to apprieciate it as a whole...",1027728000,3,867,4.753333333333333
436845,5,6302221684,I remember seeing tis movie when I was three. I watched it over and over and then one day it disappered. Just afew days ago I found out that this movie really exsisted. All i remebered was the 14 eyed creature and when they healed the Princess. I thought this movie was really good and you will remeber it for years.,1020902400,,316,4.19672131147541
436846,5,6302221684,"This movie is very well animated, and the story is easy to follow for those who are not familiar with anime.  It also has an underlying moral, and is family friendly.  I have watched this movie countless times and I still get weepy like the first time I saw it.  I do recommend this movie for those who are into the futuristic fairy tale type movies.",1019952000,4,350,4.2727272727272725
436847,5,6302221684,"I was about 10 yrs old, maybe younger when I saw this film.  It was in a.. movie shop...  Anyways i saw this thing over and over and i thought it was the top animated movie of all time (aside from Transformers and Flight of Dragons).  Man, I can believe this movie was taken off the shelf!  It kicks so much..., it should still be a rental, or on DVD.  This movie will be lost forever when VCRs finally hit the skids.",1015372800,,417,4.036585365853658
436848,2,6302221684,"A previous reviewer said that he/she doesn't think a better anime movie could be made.  My advice: see the original.  Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a stunning movie of complexity completely unknown to the animated film world of America.  The animation is pure art, the characters are as well-developed as they are well-drawn, and the plot is as beautiful as it is complex.  Miyazaki took time to fully develop every aspect of the film, and Jo Hisaishi's soundtrack is beautiful.

This studio decided to change all this for unimaginable reasons.  They cut out about a half hour of the plot, renamed the characters (Zadra?  Princess *Zadra*?!), and basically mutilated.  In short: Think Cardcaptors.  They cut out everything they thought was slow-moving, so the plot and characters aren't fully developed, and the soundtrack was mutilated as well, because the music would often be cut short or nonexistant in places where it should reflect the beauty of the visuals.  Studio Ghibli was so horrified at the end product that they asked the public to forget that this travesty ever occurred.

I have heard that Disney gained the rights to this film, and I really hope they did.  They have already released dubbed versions of Kiki's Delivery Service and Princess Mononoke.  While I am not familiar with the originals, people who are say that Disney did an excellent job, so I can only hope that they make right what is now wrong.",1012435200,43,1431,4.863636363636363

7822468,5,6302221684,"Let's face it: there had to be a first localization of this, and, like so many of the 70s and 80s adaptations of Japanese anime for American audiences, it was bound to be edited. For the most part, this isn't actually a bad version! It lacks the charm and depth of Miyazaki's original, and the woman who does Nausicaa's voice is simply AWFUL, but the rest of the actors are acceptable, and the story thrums along at a brisk pace. There's a lot to hate about this in retrospect now that we know more about Miyazaki's vision for the Nausicaa story as a whole, but at the time it was a brave effort to bring a wonderful movie over to American audiences in a way that the adaptors thought would be successful.

Yes, the box art is awful.",1389484800,2,733,4.311594202898551
7822469,5,6302221684,"I liked this movie from the moment I saw it.  Both versions - this one and Disney remake.  This is the first one I saw, of course, so I had to have it for the dialog and to keep the memory of my first encounter with it alive.",1387843200,,225,3.6666666666666665
7822470,4,6302221684,"Let's be clear: This dub does abridge and remove many nuances from the original (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind), which you certainly must watch and appreciate first (Disney's more recent English dub is pretty good as far as I'm concerned). But setting aside how offensive this cut's existence was to Mr. Miyazaki, I loved it as a kid, and I considered Nausicaa an amazingly admirable hero. The editors did remove backstory about the jungle and Nausicaa's childhood to turn it into more of an action movie, but I was still inspired all the same.

My verdict of this cut is thus: If the movie had only ever consisted of this cut (as it did in my mind throughout my childhood), I think it's still a really darned good movie. I also find it an interesting comparison piece to the Disney dub; Disney's is more faithful, but I did find certain lines and deliveries to be more compelling in WotW. Consider this version an interesting artifact: You absolutely must see the uncut version, but if you can watch this cut too without being offended by its existence, it's still fairly fun to see a second take (even if a more superficial one) on the original work.",1384646400,,1157,4.5893719806763285
7822471,1,6302221684,"This truly deserves a one star. For one, it is the fake version of the original Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. For second, it's been heavily edited. Third, Director Miyazaki's name should not even be there, since he did not intend this kind of film. Horrible. Go look at the original from Disney or Studio Ghibli.",1374624000,,318,4.5
7822472,4,6302221684,"This movie is best purchased by collectors or those who are nostalgic for one of the first english dubbed anime movies available back in the 1980's.  I own a copy and enjoy watching but it is important to note that the director was very unhappy with the editing which changed character names and almost eliminated the main plot of the original.  Sadly, the newer Disney release (Nausicaa of the valley of the wind) has relegated this version to obscurity with even Imdb failing to credit it.  I tend to feel sorry for the original voice cast as they are no longer credited anywhere for what was a terrific effort for its time. This is not to say that the Disney release is not good.  It is excellent and every bit what you would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki release and studio Ghibli.

It was a decent effort to bring anime to the west and the editors tried to anticipate that the western sensiibilities would not appreciate the environmentalist themes of the original.  If you can forget tat the director does not like this version, that the plot is dumbed down, that the characters have the wrong names, and that the lead character is not as intelligent as the orignial character; this is still very enjoyable to watch.",1328140800,3,1221,4.6036866359447
7822473,5,6302221684,I really have not had a chance to watch the movie so I'm not sure if it is the one I'm looking for. But the company I purchased it from got to me in record time. I would have no problem ordering from this company again.,1313971200,,219,3.782608695652174

7822475,4,6302221684,"I remember watching the original release of Warriors of the Wind in the theaters and then taping a copy of it later on HBO in 87/88.  I just recently purchased and watched Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  Now I enjoyed the full length version with the ""new"" scenes and sequences, but even with having Patrick Stewart as the voice of Lord Yappa (misspelled?) and Uma Thurmann as the voice of the Queen, the dialog of the film was almost entirely different from the American release.  In fact, I preferred the old dialog in the American release vs the new one... the new one doesn't make Nausicaa as strong of a female personality as she was as Zandrea in the American version.  I missed my one favorite key phrase from the American version, when Lord Yappa (or is it Yuda?) drops from the Valley's Gunship onto the transport ship, takes out 4 soldiers, leaps over the rest charging him and then has a brief sparig match with the Captain and says ""Now that you had time to think about it, you wish to surrender?""

  Overall, the new voices and dialog just didn;t have as much... ooommmph! as the version I saw in the 80s.  Though the action and music still kept me glued to my TV.",1113004800,2,1182,4.414746543778802
