7866267,2,6304239599,"""Eastern Heroes"" was released in America solely to capitalize on Robin Shou's popularity in the aftermath of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/B004MA1K1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>. American producers should have been made aware that Shou's Hong Kong career was nothing to crow about and that he immigrated to Hollywood specifically to get away from the movies he had been making back there. This film probably falls into that category, being a mild exercise in boredom highlighted by a few instances of particular nastiness. Beware.

The story: A Vietnamese hitman's (Shou) quest for vengeance makes him the target of an American policeman (Conan Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-in-the-Dragon-s-Den/dp/B00NBBR33C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja in the Dragon's Den</a>) and his Hong Kong brother in law (Ben Ng,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-True-Mob-Story/dp/B00000JZJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A True Mob Story</a>).

Playing the main villain, Shou is absent for about half of the picture, and the protagonists are not nearly as interesting as he is. Conan Lee can be a very entertaining guy, but aside from the downplayed tone of the film, the characters that he and Ben Ng play are mostly defined by their relationships to others - rendering themselves pretty bland whenever they're leading solo scenes. The plot they illustrate is not particularly difficult to follow, but the theme of revenge begetting revenge creates a very dark air. The tone is set when Shou shoots a pregnant woman to death, and the movie loses all claims to tastefulness when another pregnant woman (Jo-Jo Ngan) is gang-raped by Shou's thugs. Truly, that's a shameful moment for everyone involved in the film.

The action content is pretty evenly divided between shootouts and fistfights. For the most part, there's nothing here you haven't seen before. The shootouts are intense but mundane, and even though the cast includes some very graceful performers, the fight scenes tend to be brawls of the most inelegant kind (kudos to the poor stuntman of the first Shou/Ng fight). Some redemption arrives in the form of the final two fights, which are also broad slugfests but are well-choreographed and long enough to stand out. One of these likely constitutes the single best fight in the career of lifelong supporting kicker Mark Houghton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Heat/dp/B000QFAFMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Heat</a>).

Still, these two encounters are not worth sitting through the rest of the movie for. It's hard to recommend this one, but perhaps viewers who enjoy gritty cop/gangster drama will be moderately entertained by this minimalist effort. Otherwise, almost everyone else can stay away from this.",1428451200,,2926,6.217283950617284
7866268,3,6304239599,"This movie is a good Robin Shou flick if you are a Robin Shou fan.  If not and you like kung-fu or action movies, then this movie is pretty good too.  Robin Shou plays a good role as a bad guy.
The martial arts scenes are  well done. They are not dancey, meaning that they do not do flashy moves  just to impress people (or try to impress) such as flipping over someone.  The fights are hardcore and excellent.  The fight scenes are fast paced and  they have many grapling and throwing moves.  More down to earth Martial  Arts in an actual fight sequence.  I like that a lot. The mnor downfall is  that I was able to spot out a few stunt men here and there, but not too  much to the point where it would be annoying.  The gunshots you must  prepare for, because when someone gets shot, it is not fatal most of the  time, and the characters just continue on.  I guess that makes it  dramatic...or not.
This is a kung-fu movie and so the plot is  ""ok"".  The dialogue drags on and so does the story in the  beginning 30 minutes.  If you are brave and tolerant enough to sit through  that and understand whats going on, the movie picks up in the middle and  gets intense and pretty good.  I started being bored with it and ended up  satisfied in the end.
This movie is Not rated, but I think it should be  rated R.  Very hardcore story about vengeance both bad guys and good guys  and the battle between them. Its not one of the greatest movies ever made,  but they did put good effort into it.  Personally, I love the movie.  Hope  you enjoy it if you are into this stuff.",952819200,,1569,4.1438127090301
