1613232,2,B00005JXZC,"As opposed to other reviewers I found this very difficult to follow and do.  I would pick a class with hands on instruction instead I think.  Usually, with Kathy's other videos I have had no problem following along -- I love her functionally fit lower and upper body workouts, her kickboxing video, her timesaver weights and cardio routines etc.  All of those were wonderful and posed no special challenge.  I could do pretty much every move by try two and absolutely everything after a week or so. I found it impossible to follow this one though despite two tries. Probably better to try pilates if you are an advanced exerciser. And p.s. I have tried the Method videos and I like Kathy much better since she is so motivational.",1010361600,4,729,4.627906976744186
1613233,5,B00005JXZC,"Pilates is all new to me.  I was psyched to see that Kathy Smith was doing a video, and was even more excited to see that it was geared towards someone at my fitness level.  (Beginner/Intermediate) I'd have to agree that if you were already familiar with pilates, you may not get much from this video, however if you're looking for a sequence of pilates moves geared at working the abs, I can't see how you couldn't benefit from this tape.  She gives great instruction in the beginning on form. It was easy for me to feel like I was doing the moves right, and she does so well on stressing the breathing. (Breathe out - breathe in...great cues!) I viewed the entire video, but wasn't able to complete it in entirety yet, but it's giving me something to work up to.  I'm hoping Kathy decides to market a total body pilates video! You won't be disappointed with this tape!!!",1001894400,33,872,4.43125
1613234,5,B00005JXZC,"Rather than jump on the bandwagon right away, Kathy Smith always takes her time and produces a quality workout.  She packs alot in under 30 minutes.  As the title suggest this targets the abs or the ""core"".  You get some benefits for the legs but you core will feel it!  Smith is a careful, detailed and motivating teacher.  I have several Pilates tapes and it finally clicked with this one. I finally managed to scoop"" my abdomen and ""engage"" my powerhouse. And, while you are sitting or reclined the whole time you will sweat.  Here's hoping Smith releases an extended full-body Pilates tape in the near future.",999993600,128,613,4.682242990654205
1613265,4,B00005JXZC,...  I LOVED THIS VIDEO!!  Kathy really knows how to instruct on proper form.  I have found that the better my form becomes the more intense this workout gets.  THANKS KATHY!!!,1032912000,,176,4.580645161290323
1613266,1,B00005JXZC,"I sent this video back immediately after I watched it. The first 20 minutes of the video is just one long infomercial for the rest of the Kathy Smith videos and the ""ab workout"" lasted 10 minutes at the most and it didn't do anything different then what a few crunches would do. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1029801600,14,302,4.315789473684211
1613267,3,B00005JXZC,"Kathy Smith's pilates for Abs is only ok. There is not much information on how to do each exercise or what to do when you cannot do it fully. I was unable to do most of the exercises completely and there was no support for that scenario. There should have been more reps because the chances that someone will do those moves 100% correctly each time are slim. Also the DVD is uninspiring and I will be selling mine soon.
A good effort but not fit for beginners..",1026691200,7,461,4.25
1613268,4,B00005JXZC,"This DVD is a great introduction to Pilates and a pretty good abs workout. The 8-minute warmup gives a brief explanation of Pilates terms in easy-to-understand words that help you visualize what you should be doing. For example, to teach pelvic tilts, she asks you to imagine a marble in your bellybutton sliding to your chest and then back again as you tilt. This really helps to keep the stomach engaged and the shoulders down and isolate the movement of the pelvis. The 22-minute workout is excellent. The only thing I wish is that there were more reps of each exercise. Another demonstrator behind her shows some more advanced postures for increased difficulty. The tone of the video is very peaceful. Kathy Smith and her assistant present the material in a non-threatening manner. Having good form and using the correct muscles is an essential part of this video. In fact, the exercises become more difficult as your form improves. It is very easy to cheat and still do the exercises without doing them correctly. If used properly, I believe this is an excellent addition to a regular workout.",1019174400,10,1098,4.845744680851064
1613269,4,B00005JXZC,"I find this video to be very difficult.  The movements require heavy use of your abs (thus the name).  If your abs are not very strong, as is the problem with mine, some of the moves are next to impossible.  I will continue to use the tape but maybe once I am in better shape.  Oh yeah, and she talks too much too!",1014336000,3,314,3.9365079365079363
1613270,5,B00005JXZC,"It's hard to imagine who could provide a better introduction to Pilates, which stresses form over high reps, than Kathy Smith. She is ingenious in creating images to help you understand, without benefit of a personal trainer, how to achieve the core stability that is central to Pilates.
Kathy's cuing, as always, is superb. Even the most basic beginning exerciser, could benefit from this tape. It provides a superior ab workout and gives you better posture and form to do any other type of exercise. Highly recommended.",1011830400,4,521,5.0
1613271,3,B00005JXZC,"I really like Kathy's detailed description of how to use your ab muscles and breathe while doing Pilates. But I prefer a longer video-this one is is less than 30 minutes and she talks for a good part of it. It also was less intense than I would have liked. I would have liked a section on Advanced Pilates moves, and this video only features Beginning/Intermediate Pilates. It's not a video that someone already in shape or someone used to doing abdominal work will find challenging.",1011398400,15,483,4.627906976744186
1613272,5,B00005JXZC,"As a person who has been doing Yoga for a while I have been dying to try Pilates.  I usually buy Kathy Smith tapes so I was very excited to see that she came out with a Pilates tape.  The workout is great and it goes very quickly.  Pilates seems harder than Yoga, but that probably makes it a better workout.
I am hoping that Kathy will soon come out with more Pilates based workouts (hopefully in DVD format).
This is defintely worth the money.  It is a very cheap way to find out if you like Pilates.",1010707200,3,502,4.091836734693878
1613273,4,B00005JXZC,"Living up to her reputation as a fitness instructor, Kathy Smith explains the fundamentals of each exercise she subjects, er, introduces you to.  She describes each movement and technique in easy-to-understand terms (""stop the flow..."").  Compared to the Denise Austin Pilates video, the exercises in this one are more beginner-level, as the Teaser is done at the most advanced with only one leg in the air.  Kathy uses a few different exercises than Denise Austin does, and she also doesn't do the percussion breathing thing.  But don't underestimate the difficulty of either tape:  the exercises look very easy, but they're really difficult if you do them right.
I think that in the spirit of unity, this would be a good tape to do as you master the techniques of Pilates (which know-it-all me has not yet done), then use Denise Austin's Pilates + Yoga after you get ""good"" at doing the one-legged teaser on Kathy's tape.",1010534400,17,923,4.891025641025641
7942652,5,B00005JXZC,Super awesome workout. Low intensity but works your core amazingly. Perfect condition.,1444348800,,86,6.25
7942653,5,B00005JXZC,"I have whiplash, and my doctor released me to do Pilates.  I've been doing classes in a studio, and supplementing with this great Kathy Smith DVD.

This is one of my favorite Pilate DVDs that I have seen to date.  She explains different levels, and I loved her talking about the bikini butt, as well as knitting the ribs together.  I had heard these Pilates concepts/corrections years ago, but didn't seem to get it until Kathy explained it.

Great workout, about 30 minutes, excellent instruction!",1419033600,,498,4.811764705882353
7942654,5,B00005JXZC,"This is an older DVD but still great.  Has very effective abdominal exercises that include someone demonstrating the advanced way to perform the exercise as well as Kathy Smith demonstrating the easier way.  The thing to remember as she keeps emphasizing throughout the workout is navel to the spine.  That keeps your core activated and reaches the deeper layers of abdominal muscles.  If you keep doing that, it will be challenging and effective.  Your core will start feeling firmer after a few workouts.  Would definitely recommend this DVD.",1398384000,,544,5.125
7942655,4,B00005JXZC,"At the start of this video, Kathy Smith takes a full 7 minutes to discuss proper form and alignment.  She covers important Pilates terms such as the powerhouse, and she also offers detailed form pointers including how to pull your navel toward your spine, how to tilt your pelvis, and how to contract your pelvic floor (similar to Kegel exercises).  Although I was already familiar with Pilates, I found this section to be a very helpful refresher, and I appreciated Kathy's unique instruction.
Kathy then moves on to the workout.  Although she doesn't do the moves in the classic Pilates sequence--she notes that she altered the sequence to focus even more specifically on the abs--she does start with the typical Pilates first exercise, the Hundred.  She performs this and other moves at a modified level while her assistant, Lija, demonstrates more challenging positions.  The exercises include lesser-known Pilates moves such as the Can-Can and the Mermaid as well as a yoga pose, Bridge.  Kathy offers form reminders throughout the workout, and I found this to be particularly helpful in making sure that the work was concentrated in my abs.  The entire workout is over in a quick 20 minutes, but by the end, my abs definitely felt the work.
Although this workout is appropriate for those at a beginning level, I wouldn't recommend it to someone totally brand new to Pilates, as it proceeds a bit too quickly.  Instead, a Pilates novice could use either Ana Caban's Beginner's Mat Work or Hilary Burnett's Pilates for Beginners to obtain more detailed instruction on performing the movements.  Once the basic technique is learned, however, this workout is appropriate for beginning or intermediate Pilates practitioners who want a short program which specifically targets the abdominal muscles.",1074816000,11,1799,5.112627986348123
7942656,3,B00005JXZC,"This video would make an excellent introduction to Pilates for the beginning exerciser.  As usual, Kathy explains each movement very well and reminds the exerciser to engage the powerhouse throughout the video.  However she spends little time on each movement and the intensity level is very low.  As an intermediate/advanced exerciser I did not feel like I got a good workout - way too short in reps and too long in instruction for longterm use to be of benefit.",1068336000,7,463,4.8354430379746836
7942657,5,B00005JXZC,"Of all the Pilates tapes available on this, the planet Earth, Kathy Smith has produced the very best.  I have tried others, but nothing matches the graceful (almost soothing)intensity of this 22 minute Pilates workout.  Smith guides the viewer through each exercise and explains when to breathe and how to position yourself.  Kathy Smith has been around for a while, and to be honest, the proof is in the appearance.  She looks terrific.  There is a reliability about Kathy that is hard-earned and well-deserved.  I have used this tape for two years now.  Other Pilates tapes have come and gone for me, but Kathy is the one I pull off the shelf every evening.",1060905600,6,659,4.728070175438597
7942658,2,B00005JXZC,"There are definitively better pilates videos out there. Pass on this one. Kathy Smith obviously is complementing her vast array of excercises techniques with pilates, here specifically focused on abs -- without really understanding or conveying what they are all about.
Smith spends 10 minutes discussing key terms of pilates (powerhouse, spine alignment etc.)  -- a bore for people who know something about it and confusing for those who don't --in all a waste of tape for those who plan to use the video more than once. Then she goes into some pilates excercices, indeed focused on abs -- but she organizes them in whatsoever way, some seem like fluff; others, more tough, are rushed. She does not guide you through the breathing techniques of pilates properly, so that you are either struggling for breath or feel like a balloon about to burst (in one set she just keeps on telling you to inhale without ever letting you know when to exhale!). Worst of all, this exercise guru offers no stretches at the end to strech out your tight abs!!
Finally, particularly annoying is that Smith cheers you on like a cheerleader through the whole video -- so that by the end you are quite irritated, certainly not focused and relaxed, as one should be with pilates. Smith is definitively better at boppy cardio aereobics and should stick to that.",1051747200,9,1337,4.8130434782608695
7942659,3,B00005JXZC,"It's my frist Kathy Smith's video and i'm not as pleased as I thought I would be...it's short and I didn't feel the ab muscles at all after the workout. I,however,loved the intro where kathy explains Pilates. It is worth giving a try but don't get too excited. It is reserved for beginners because I, as an intermediate/advanced exerciser, am only going to use this one when i'm cranched for time.",1041638400,3,397,4.605633802816901
7942660,4,B00005JXZC,"Kathy Smith's Pilates for Abs workout is a challenging workout for the abdominals. This DVD is great for both beginning and more advanced work outs.
The Pilates philosophy is all about perfect repetitions every time, so you're not going to be doing sit-ups for the entire workout. The movements are isometric and difficult if you maintain correct postures. This workout focuses on the shoulders, ribs, abs, and engaging your hamstrings.
Kathy has Leah working out with her, and Leah demonstrates more advanced versions of the movements when you are ready to move up to that level. This feature will keep you using this DVD over time.
While the workout only runs 20 minutes, I find it a great complement to an existing routine of cardio and light weights. I combine this workout with a 30-minute cardio segment for a well-rounded day.",1040256000,4,833,4.914893617021277
7942661,3,B00005JXZC,"Th instruction is fantastic and Kathy explains things very well and gives you harder options to do.  She also reminds you often to engage your powerhouse.
Because Pilates is quite different from the good old crunchies you feel you are not working as hard, but believe me you are!  The reps she uses is very low, but that is because if you do the movement exactly right and use your mind focus as well you will see a difference.",1034553600,2,427,4.3924050632911396
