8507766,5,B0070EHP5C,"Leyla is an awesome teacher. This Dvd teaches many different layers to be used in choreography or for improvisation. What I really like about Leyla is that she takes time to demonstrate and explain how to do each move with her drummer. I found belly dance instruction with live drumming is the best way to learn. There is a lot to learn from this and be ready to work and learn.
It includes different segments of layers with traveling steps on these moves:
  Shuheir Zaki
  Camel
  Reverse Camel
  Torso Rotation
  Hip Rotation",1334534400,2,527,4.630434782608695
