8174707,5,B00006IZCJ,"This product is perfect for what it can do and for the price.  This is why I gave it 5 stars.
Just to have something to add to the bedroom and great tips.",1357084800,,154,3.6666666666666665
8174708,5,B00006IZCJ,Video was very informative. Most are not satisfied sexually because they forget about the foreplay.  The couples in the video looked like they were really in love. The interviews with the locals were very interesting too. This video really helped to improve my relationship.,1332720000,,274,5.2272727272727275
8174709,4,B00006IZCJ,"In Living Color professional, instructional video for AA couples; young or seasoned.  Really enjoyed seeing a variety of AA couples in realistic settings being loving, sexual, open and desired.

Thought the ""on-the-street"" feature was a very good.  DVD helps couples open or continue sexual conversations. Enjoyed the gift set, in spite of some stilted acting & scripts the DVD did have good basic information and beautiful shots.  Would recommend the gift set.  Did not get the instructional manual mentioned in other reviews.",1253318400,,527,5.378048780487805
8174710,1,B00006IZCJ,"I am so disappointed in this set.  First of all, you can only watch the videos once because there's talking THROUGHOUT from experts, the couples themselves and people on the street.  That info is cool the first time you watch them, but after that I'm more interested in the scenes.  You can't watch any of the scenes without fast forwarding through the commentary.

Next, a lot of the scenes were extemely boring and ordinary.  The only really good scene is the one on S/M.",1221264000,4,473,4.583333333333333
8174711,5,B00006IZCJ,"First of all I must say that for the price of this set you definitely get your money's worth. This DVD set was very informative and very entertaining as well. Along with the book SoulMates: An Illustrated Guide to Black Love, Sex, and Romance by Eric V. Copage and this DVD set you  have a complete set of instrucional material to aid in your sex education especially tailored for African-Americans. The book further expalins the concepts the shown in the DVDs, which was also helpful for those of us who like a little more detail. I highly recommend both products.",1111449600,11,565,4.65
8174712,4,B00006IZCJ,"This video received a 4 star because there are so few AA instructional videos that are professionally done. I would give this set to a very young couple just getting married. The information is basic. However, for the more experienced it gives you some sensual scenes to get you in the mood or to get you and your mate talking about sex.  Both volumes interview people on the street about oral sex, foreplay, anal sex, role playing, sex outside the bedroom (park, jacuzzi). Then you are given little sex scenes with very loving AA couples. The video will definitely arouse you. I learned something from the massage lesson. It's a very nice set with three pleasant looking couples with intelligence and confidence in the bedroom. I recommend it. I do have one fault with the company that made the video. The same set/video/dvd are sold with a different name. I thought I would take advantage of having an AA collection of four when really ""Loving Sex"" volume 1 is the same as Intimate Loving volume 1 and  Loving Sex volume 2 is the same as Intimate Loving volume two.  The gift set is cheaper than the individual dvds.",1057190400,26,1118,4.636363636363637
