7910055,4,B00000IC1T,"Bought the documentary Saturday.  Have watched it at least 10 times, and it's only Monday.  Devoured the Jet Li footage.  Couldn't get enough of the drunken sword at the end.  Very impressed with Terry Fan, too.  Would have liked to have seen more of him in the film.  The rest of the footage was cheesy propoganda, but the clips of JL made it worthwhile.  I loved it.",1108339200,,368,4.402985074626866
7910056,4,B00000IC1T,"This dvd's content balances enironmental/cultural/ and martial interests in researching gong fu in China. For someone like myself who is studying Martial arts and who can only dream of visiting the Shaolin temple, a dvd like this allows for more familiarity of the temple. Many of the martial artists performing are obviously of rather high quaility. I enjoyed it, and will re-watch it.",1087257600,,386,5.142857142857143

You will wanna watch it a second time next day, at least thats how it went with me. Go buy it now!",1055721600,,263,4.076923076923077
7910058,1,B00000IC1T,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I carefully looked at the box before purchasing it and realized that it was a documentary. Which was what I thought I was getting. Truth be told though, this is more of a propoganda film than a documentary.  It was produced by the PRC (people's republic of china) and displays kung fu much as one would expect them to display their latest military technological advances: in a manner to inspire pride in the Chinese people and fear in everyone else.  The end result is a little absurd to anyone with much in the way of intelligence.  Most of the forms sequences in it are sped up a great deal.  They also make little distinction between the mediocre and the astounding. Personally, I was hoping for a documentary that showed some real kung fu (as opposed to modern sport wu shu), which while it does this, most of it is sped up, destroying the beauty of it and making it impossible to see the details of movement.  The sound on it is truly atrocious as well, the original music being cut off abruptly every time someone speaks, showing an immense ineptitude on the part of the sound engineers.  For the fanatics, yes, there are several scenes of a young Jet Li, ages 8 to 18.  Not that this is a huge plus.  I truly cannot understand how the man became to be the great wushu champion that he supposedly was.  I have seen dozens of practitioners who show more skill and talent than he does.  He's not bad, but I simply do not see the world class athlete that his publicists make him out to be.  Which brings me to one of the few pluses for this film: Terry Fan.  Seeing him right after Jet Li only emphasizes the disparity.  For the five minutes or so that we see him, he truly shines (of course it helps that his section wasn't sped up like the others).  There are a few other places that were good: duck kung fu, the 100 year old practitioners and several of the sword katas were good in spite of their speed. On the whole, I would not pick this one up unless you found it for under ...",1005436800,7,2023,4.317460317460317
7910059,4,B00000IC1T,"If you are into Wu-shu or Shoalin Martial arts, this video is a MUST HAVE! Sure the over dubbed english is a bit annoying, but they don't talk while demonstrating forms. I Think what made me give it a 4 out of a Five was the  damn sound effects they dubbed in for the weaponz. Other then that, the  talent these martial artists have is Truley amazing, and as for Jet Li...  Astonishing! so what are you still reading for, go order it damnitt!",947721600,9,442,4.238095238095238
