7909548,3,B00000I1Y1,"I have been a fan of Capstick's writings for 30 years. The books are highly entertaining. This video was made late in Peter Capstick's career and it really shows an hunter beyond his prime. Capstick is a good teacher and you can learn something about Africa and hunting in this video. It's good entertainment. The action shots are good,but there are scenes that are obviously staged for the sake of continuity along with trite expressions familiar to anyone who has read his books-notably 'paying the insurance' with a follow-up shot. Too bad ole Peter hadn't made this video when he was 20 years younger. It looks like a last gasp effort to produce something to pay his bills.",1057708800,,677,4.745762711864407
7909549,2,B00000I1Y1,"I have read everyone of CapStick's books. Death in the long grass is the greatest book every written about African hunting. Every story in that book  grabs you and takes you to the Africa you dream of... This film bring you  back to earth and shows you what every hunter already knows ... Hunting is  99% boring and 1% action... and this film is too.  My final word is buy  every one of his Books, not his films. IF you have all of Capstick book buy  the films to finish your  Collection of Capstick",967507200,,499,4.24468085106383
