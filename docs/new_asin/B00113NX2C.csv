8298037,5,B00113NX2C,"I rated Up the Elephant and round the Castle 5 star because to me it was one of the funniest British comedies I've
watched,and I've watched most of them.
I've shown it to my friends and they got a good laugh out of it I would reconmend it to anyone that could use a laugh.
  I was very pleased with the shipping and surprised at how quick I received the product after ordering, the
DVD's arrived on the day they said it would only waited about 20 day's I call that good service considering it was
shipping from Germany.  Regards Bruce.",1354579200,,535,4.2772277227722775
