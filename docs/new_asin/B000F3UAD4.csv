8117083,5,B000F3UAD4,"Deer Woman was my favorite of the two, but you get a lot of bang for the buck with Sick Girl too.  DW had the feel of a 70s horror show, and it was also very campy at times, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna cringe, etc.  With Sick Girl, you just get a uneasy feeling.  The 'sick' girl wasn't the most likable character (which actually helped the horror element), but it was a long time getting there!  Anyway, I'd recommend these, not many people seem to know about them generally and that is a shame, they're fun!",1158278400,,514,4.268041237113402
