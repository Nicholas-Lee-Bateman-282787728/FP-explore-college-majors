7979116,5,B000084T7E,"I knew what to expect for I owned a tape of it for years.  But, tape is the past; it is much easier to enjoy the disc version. While the music is the same....(great), the visual seems reworked and brighter.  Corelli is such a pleasure and this just proves while time moves, his performances are timeless treasures.  May they remain available to all future generations, no matter how the format changes.",1269907200,6,402,4.633802816901408
7979117,5,B000084T7E,everything went well - the DVD was here in due time and the quality was also o.k.,1238371200,2,81,3.823529411764706
7979118,5,B000084T7E,"Corelli's performance was magnificent once again proving his superiority as the ultimate Andre Chenier.  He convincingly portrays this role with all the emotion and stature required of this challenging role.  All fans of Corelli will not be disappointed, as once again, Corelli delivers a legendary performance, clearly solidifying his standing as the ultimate 20th century tenor.  The opera itself was opulant with beautiful sets and costumes.  The supporting cast is outstanding.  This is well worth the  meager cost of the dvd.  Highly recommended.",1203811200,18,551,5.566265060240964
7979119,3,B000084T7E,"This recording clearly has some historical interest, primarily because of Franco Corelli in the title role.  Other than that, it sadly shows its age.  The sound is thin, and sometimes tinny.  It was produced to be a television show or movie, and the lip synching is often visibly un-synched.  In addition, the producers think it somehow adds to the overall effect have people talking and shouting (crowd noise) over the music, so they employ this effect much too much.
We still need a good DVD production of Andrea Chenier.  This one is actually frustrating, because as you watch it, and listen to the wonderful music, you think ""if only this were 20 years more recent, and a good, well-produced, live recording.""",1059782400,20,713,4.859504132231405
