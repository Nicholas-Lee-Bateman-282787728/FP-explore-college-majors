8309258,5,B001HOLJ76,"If Salvador Dali had sex with Lucio Fulci and miraculous birthed a love child, it would be Subconscious Cruelty.

A brutal disturbing visceral rape of the mind. I love it and was totally floored by its vivid nature. It bleeds a nightmarish reality. A true insanity of images and actions. If you have not seen this then that explanation is the best way to describe it, for if you haven't seen it, it's hard to explain other than it being a living nightmare or a vortex into an alternate labyrinth of the mind.

This plays with the senses. It plays with the mind and emotions by showcasing images that are frankly disturbing and special-effects and make up that is truly brilliant for this odd, weird, strange and interesting nightmarish film.

Yep I now know what it feels like to drop acid.

I have seen the inner recesses of the mind, it is Subconscious Cruelty. A brutal, disturbing masterpiece of visual imagery that clouds all logical thinking. Behold if HELL really does exist then the gates are open and the pits are burning brightly, for the eyes cannot un-see what has been seen.

Truly one of the most ungodly original films that I have ever seen and trust me when I say I have seen a whole hell of a lot of films that are truly visceral. If you could see inside Charles Manson mind, then this might be what's within it.

Your first segment is titled: Ovarian Eyeball.

Second Segment is titled: Human Larvae.

A man narrators. A voice over of strange, odd, confusing and disturbing images. A man obsessed with his sister. A brother who lust after his sister and fascinated with the un-born child within her. His wish is to create the mockery of birth.

This film has an amazing soundtrack. The music creates this brilliantly asinine picture into a crystal clear understanding of visual hell. The music itself is a tour-de-force of musical mastery. A haunting mix of tunes that is the equivalent of what fear would sound like. Teruhiko Suzuki original music score is ear listening perfection. Also the additional songs by David Kristian and Mike Cerminara are also brilliantly placed and weaved with the story taking place. David Kristian did a stunning job on the sound department, giving the film a pulse if you will. The sounds and music truly came to life in this twisted orgy of imagery and violence.

8309259,5,B001HOLJ76,one of the coolest movies I ever watched if you like disturbing. this one fits the bill perfect I love this,1401580800,,107,4.142857142857143
8309260,4,B001HOLJ76,"I watched this movie on YouTube, and it was the entire movie. First of all, I would not support this movie, because it is sac religious. Second of all, is because that images will get in your head. The thing is, that the stories were good, but it was the last story that just basically got me asking myself, ""How would someone do a story like that?"" I don't wanna go into detail, but it was awful, because of me being a Christian. It was just completely awful to watch. If you are Wicca, or Pagan, then please don't watch the third story.

Here is what I liked about the movie though. The colours, and I also like the music. The music was great! I really enjoyed it a lot.

Please do not watch this movie if you are religious, or if you are a person who has a weak stomach.",1377129600,2,773,4.112582781456954
8309261,1,B001HOLJ76,"We heard alot about this movie so we decided to give it a go and well....yeah didn't much care for it.  A freind of ours loved it and was talking about symbolism and deep connotations and meaning but we just aren't that technical about the films we watch.  We prefer to watch movies for enjoyment or a little reality break.

So with that being said...we found the movie to be rather boring.  It is more of a group of short flicks and the only real theme is that they include gore.  I don't mind gore but I would prefer a plot to go along with it. The shorts basically consist of:  woman with eyeball in stomach, guy killing his sister and her newborn baby, people trying to have sex with the planet and a group of women removing Christ off the cross to defile his body and urinate on him.

The movie doesn't have a plot or any character development.  I guess this is why I got so bored with it.  There isn't anything to care about in the film.  It also doesn't help when the acting is lackluster yet laughable at parts.  I understand alot of people were in awe of this film considering it took a decade to make and numerous people contributed to it but...it is boring unless you want to watch some gore without a story I wouldn't recommend it.  The only way I would recommend it is just to shock someone but they would have to be sensitive about religion or saving the planet.  The only positive thing I can say about this film is I did laugh at the part where a group of people were trying to have sex with the Earth.  The way they rolled around on the ground in amor was funny.  The only other part was when a guy played with another's semen.  I found this funny considering it is suppose to be real semen.  I don't know many (if any) guys who would play with another's semen even for money.  It isn't really sanitary. (Also, I was told the semen was real - I don't know if it was or not.  If it is real I don't know if it is human or not.  This was something a friend told us he heard).

Nonetheless when I watch a movie with gore featured prominantly in it, I prefer the movie to have a bit of a plot/storyline.  I would rather recommend  A Serbian Film, Human Centipede 2 or Singapore Sling...even Nekromantik was more amusing than this film.",1328313600,5,2247,4.210772833723653
8309262,4,B001HOLJ76,"I can handle a lot of graphic images but this was a lot!  I have only watched the first film (Human Larvae) so far and it twisted my stomach in knots. Probably because I am a woman.  I've seen a lot of disturbing films including 120 days of Salo (which didn't even bother me) and not even that left a scar on my brain like this film has.  Check it out but only if you can handle it, and do not if you are pregnant by any means!!!",1275350400,2,429,3.852272727272727
