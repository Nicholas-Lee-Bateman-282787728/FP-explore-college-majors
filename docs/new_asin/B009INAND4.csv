5340366,4,B009INAND4,"Never shown in its entirety (not all the episodes from the only season were broadcast), this friendly skewering of hippies, tree huggers, vegans, liberals and others on the left side of the political spectrum by the creator of BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD, KING OF THE HILL, OFFICE SPACE and IDIOCRACY is funny yet thoughtful and never really mean to those it makes fun of.  The voice talent is top notch and there are some parts that will make you laugh out loud, whether you are a commie pinko or proto-Fascist.  Highly recommended.",1362787200,7,523,4.736263736263736
5340367,3,B009INAND4,"This was kinda lame.  I mean, it was OK, but I fell asleep a lot as my boyfriend kept watching, out of boredom. Can't even compare to King of the Hill or Beavis Butt-Head, which I would love to buy new ones of both!",1361923200,3,215,3.8863636363636362
5340368,5,B009INAND4,"I loved this show when it was on TV and was disappointed it got cancelled. I'm kind of wondering if over-sensitive people weren't behind getting it cancelled and/or attempts to bring back the series. But I don't find the material mean-spirited AT ALL. It's similar to King of the Hill in quality and smart satiric writing. Like-able characters conflicted over trying to do the right thing.

There is an inherent conflict in trying to be good all the time. It can take over your life. I related with the huge board in the whole-foods-type market which tells shoppers what's good and bad. The board is constantly changing and that's how it feels to me in real life. The same people who walked around with bottled water when I was in high school, presumably because the water wasn't good enough, are now judgmental of water bottles. What, you didn't know about landfills at the time?! The list could go on...

That's fair game for comedy. I would recommend this show, and if you don't find humor in it, maybe do a quick gut-check. You may be taking yourself a little too seriously!",1361750400,5,1078,4.638743455497382
5340369,5,B009INAND4,"I didn't know about this cartoon until I read Mike Judge's filmography. So, upon seeing this was the complete series, I didn't want to miss out on some more Mike Judge material. And I'm glad I ordered it, because I have loved each episode.",1361145600,4,239,4.454545454545454
5340370,5,B009INAND4,"Still grieving over the cancellation of King of the Hill, I was eager to catch Mike Judge's next great offering.

This time, he satired myself and other 'left-wingers'. In our rush to be socially conscious, we're accidentally--but good-intentionally--tripping over ourselves. Delivering such sophisticated critiques in a 'cartoon' format are why his work continued standing out and above competitors.

An example of this humor was ""Pilot"". Wanting to 'be open' with her daughter Bliss, Helen's detailed 's ""the sex"" talk ironically then sends her running into the arms of an abstinence group merely in protest. Laughing along with the storyline, I know that ALL teens are uncomfortable taking with their parents about sex. And the series spoofs how I and my peers could accidentally end up raising our own kids down the road.

They are genuinely nice people, but the Goode's kindness gets exploited in 'Freeganomics'. In an effort to be the 'Greenest' people around, the Goodes must realize their environmental guru is nothing more than a bum who has very cleverly learned to work people to sustain his life on the streets. He can preach about recycling and sustainability all day because he does not actually have to think about how to effectively or properly support himself. Unlike the Goodes and other real-life progressives, he exploits concern about recycling to merely lay about in his own compost mooching off of people with good intentions!

""A Tale of Two Lesbians"" touched on the naivety earlier. Wanting to prove that they 'weren't homophobic' Helen and Gerald set out to befriend a lesbian couple. When Gerald accidentally makes an anti-gay slur, the Goodes, then desperately scramble to prove that themselves. This adventure takes them from upscale lesbian chic to butch couples--where they discover a WIDE spectrum of human sexuality does exist.

I heard something about this series in the local tv 'previews' then stumbled upon it by sheer accident. It got quickly cancelled because it was never really promoted in the lineups. I am sorry that ABC did not do more to visibly and openly advertize the series. The complete series is here and the studios did not do anything funny like spliting the episodes into two packages or changing the music. You will feel great after watching ""Goode"".",1358553600,,2305,5.11968085106383
5340371,5,B009INAND4,"I am a TV on DVD reviewer who received an advance copy of this set. This review IS based on that set.

This review may get my home pelted with cage-free organic eggs, but watching Shout Factory's complete series DVD set, which is being released on January 8, 2013, of the 13-episode 2009 animated comedy ""The Goode Family"" prompted anger that the series did not last longer. A Christmas wish is that it be revived in the same manner as ""Family Guy"" and ""Futurama.""

I do not intend to offend anyone but wish to communicate both that ""Goode"" is an excellent show and that my personal experiences show that that series expertly lampoons a very influential segment of the American population.

Mike Judge, who brought us the cult classic film ""Office Space"" and the anti-""Goode Family"" hit series ""King of the Hill,"" produced this show about fanatically liberal and progressive couple Gerald and Helen Goode. These folks make Green Party members seem like Tea Baggers.

""Goode"" is incredibly awesome and does an even better job at depicting folks to whom I refer as beret wearing poseurs than Judge did regarding providing a look at redneck life in ""King.""

For the record, I consider myself a moderate and reasonable individual who strongly believes that this nation needs a viable moderate and reasonable political party but ain't holding my breath waiting for that to occur.

I will add that Whole Foods' macaroni and cheese is a contender if I ever need to choose a death-row meal, that I prefer the high quality snacks at Whole Food to more mass-produced products (including the two boxes of Twinkies in my freezer), and that I interrupted writing this view to shop at LL Bean's website.

The main difference regarding ""King"" and ""Goode"" is that rednecks seem to have a much better sense of humor about themselves than extreme liberals. As I demonstrate below, ""Goode"" is spot on and has a wonderful sense of humor regarding fanatical environmental and social conscious views.

The pilot, which centers around wife Helen trying to bond with teen daughter Bliss about sex, includes a scene in which Helen shops at the Whole Foods clone ""One Earth."" A hilarious shot in that scene shows the price of seemingly identical apples increasing dramatically as their level of organicness supposedly increases. Of course, Helen purchases the most expensive ones.

The scene ends with a highly embarrassed Helen earning evil stares from the checkout cashier and other customers because she forgot her reusable bags. Rather than use paper bag, Helen juggles (and drops) her purchases in her hands.

This scene reminded me of driving across the entire city of Denver during rush hour with a friend, who is very active with the Green Party, to get lettuce at a Whole Foods because he refused to shop at a traditional grocery store.

Of course, my friend refused to get a bag any time that we shopped during the visit. This once involved him juggling (and dropping) items.

Similarly. Trader Joe's cashiers always insist on cramming my paper bags so full that they inevitably break. I have also had requests for plastic bags, to better keep frozen items cool, met with looks that suggested that I made an unwelcome sexual advance.

Closer to home, there have been a few times when another friend's car has come incredibly close to running out of gas late at night because he refused to buy gas from Mobil Exxon because he disagreed with some of their corporate policies.

Another episode has husband Gerald Goode campaigning for a Public Broadcast Radio (PBR) station in his community. He succeeds to learn that this NPResque organization is just as ruthless as openly commercial radio stations. A PBR representative trying to explain that a 30-second corporate sponsorship message differs from a radio ad is hilarious.

I regularly listen to NPR and attended a wonderful live recording of  that network's ""Wait Wait Don't Tell Me."" However, I have patronized many ""corporate sponsors"" because I wanted their products independently of their support for public broadcast.

I also love the ""Car Talk"" guys' references to their ""shameless commerce"" division.

Additional terrific episodes include one in which Gerald inadvertently acquires a group of immigrant day laborers and Helen accidentally exploits a third-world refugee. Judge follows this one up with Helen and Gerald getting inner-city kids pummeled by posting their artsy photos in their school.

An additional great theme is the subversive acts of Bliss, who is the Marilyn Munster of the group, and her redneck maternal grandfather. Seeing this pair gleefully throw out disgusting and embarrassing items to torment a visiting guru who lives on items from garbage cans is fall on the floor funny.

An episode in which Bliss and Grandpa operate a joint fake ID business is equally funny. They recognize that her friends can drive at night and that his friends can buy beer.

The bottom line is that this is an excellent show that is rarely, if ever, syndicated that is well worth owning. The deleted scenes and unaired scripts are nice bonuses.",1354752000,14,5089,4.9705535924617195

5340396,5,B009INAND4,"Honestly surprised that this show didn't gain more traction, but maybe it came out a little too soon before the big ""vegan"" and ""paleo"" trends swept through the American culture.

In contrast to the possibly more familiar later-seasons of ""King of the Hill"", the characters and family dynamics with the Goodes are closer to season 1 ""King of the Hill"" and even more similar to sort of locked-in and diverse identities of ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"". Which is to say that this isn't so much about ""realism"" like ""King of the Hill"" was, but is more about cartoonish satire like ""American Dad"", while ending up somewhere in the middle.

As someone who decided to become a lifelong vegan halfway through my 21st year, and as someone who very much has never been a hippie, I really love the way this show goes at everything from both sides right from the start. It may seem like they're just mocking an exaggerated version of ""American Dad"" starring Ed Begley Jr, but really it's about taking things to extremes and the ridiculousness of sticking to labels.

The white-skinned adopted (South) African son, the rebellious teen daughter, the recycled grey-water shower in the front yard, the ""vegan"" dog who goes full terminator whenever he sees a squirrel, but is too malnourished to chase it down. It's definitely a mockery of a lot of that kind of SoCal Whole-Foods-ier-than-thou lifestyle ... but they do justice to the central heart of the show and the characters in that they really are just trying to be a good family (OH i get it, that's the name!).

If you like ""King of the Hill"" and want sillier, hippier, ridiculousness, this was a great start to what might have been an amazingly great show. It's really unfortunate that it got cancelled, but I think it kind of paved the sunday night Fox primetime way for the undeniably perfect ""Bob's Burgers"" that shows no signs of stopping any time soon. This shares that kind of same heart and hopefulness, but also a family of fools creating chaos all around them.

It's probably not gonna be streaming anywhere anytime soon, so definitely grab a copy of this if you're interested!",1457136000,2,2130,4.745945945945946

5340414,5,B009INAND4,"Fantastic series from the creator of Beavis and Butthead. King of the Hill, and Office Space. No ideology is safe here. Not surprisingly, it didn't last. Networks love when you make fun of the hayseeds, but not when you make fun of them.",1426636800,2,237,4.534883720930233

5340416,2,B009INAND4,"A far cry from Judge's earlier ""King of the Hill.""

The whole art of ""King"" was to slowly reveal its dysfunctional ""bubbas"" as relate-able human beings -- not just redneck stereotypes. I'd never thought I'd care about the Hills and their friends and neighbors ... until I did. Then I couldn't get enough.

Here Judge and KotH showrunners John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky turn over that coin to find the very stereotypes of hyper-sensitive counterculture that would have made Hank Hill shudder.

But the KotH magic does not repeat. While there is the funny bit here and there, the show always seems in a hurry, too much like other frenetic grown-up cartoons of its era, with too little evidence of Judge's fingerprints and without notable attempt to beat down stereotypes through attrition. (Rather, it seems to fairly revel in them.) In the end, I didn't care about the Goodes at all and wound up enduring them more than I enjoyed them.",1420329600,9,936,4.801242236024844

5340418,5,B009INAND4,"Meet the Goode Family: Gerald, a dyed-in-the-wool liberal environmentalist (voiced by Mike Judge of 'King of the Hill' and 'Beavis & Butthead' fame); his wife Helen, a well-meaning social climber who buys only organic food (Nancy Carell, wife of comedian Steve); Bliss, their sardonic and enterprising teenage daughter (Linda Cardinelli, 'Freeks and Geeks'); their mechanically inclined son Ubuntu whom they adopted from South Africa (Dave Herman, 'MAD-TV'), and finally their dog Che who, like the rest of the family, is vegan...or so they think!

A conscientious clan with a garden in their front AND back yard, two solar panels on their roof, and an outdoor shower that uses collected rainwater, the Goodes strive to be the perfect progressive family--but it's not easy. They struggle with changing trends and political correctness. While coexisting with their blue-collar friends and Helen's conservative dad, they try to do their part by starting a pet rescue, adopting a highway, or bringing public radio to their small Midwestern neighborhood, always with unintended and hilarious results.

'The Goode Family' was created by Mike Judge and two other writers from 'King of the Hill', and looking back I think it could have been equally successful. It has all the right ingredients: an interesting premise, good writers, sharp voice acting, a strong pilot episode, and an undercurrent of realism and sincerity to balance out the edgy humor. I think if it had debuted on FOX with the other successful adult cartoons, it would be in its sixth season with a big fan base and a handful of awards.

Instead it was buried on ABC's summer lineup and cancelled after its first season in 2009. I never knew the show existed until I stumbled on it while surfing for 'Beavis & Butthead' clips, but it hooked me from the very beginning. I just had to find out more about this show and see every single episode. Thanks to Shout Factory giving it a second life on DVD, I did, and I urge you to do the same! All 13 episodes are included on two single-sided discs with a crystal-clear picture and 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound. They don't skimp on the extras either: deleted scenes, previews, three scripts of unaired episodes, and four commentary tracks by head writers John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky (no Mike Judge, sadly).

I strongly recommend this show to anyone who likes smart cartoon comedies, especially fans of Judge's work and liberals who can laugh at themselves and the ironies of progressive American culture.",1416960000,6,2509,5.009592326139089

5340422,4,B009INAND4,"Not that my viewership alone would have saved it, but anyhow. Yeah, I don't know why this died out so soon, some speculate it's because it bashed the left which is a no no in Hollywood, but if that's the case why would they have greenlit it in the first place? I don't know, maybe it just wasn't promoted properly, I had never heard of it and only found it by chance 5yrs later.

To leftist who hate it, well, come on now, there is no shortage of movies/TV shows bashing right wingers, as someone who's views are more middle of the road it's nice to see the other side get some criticism for once. Funny thing is tho, for those who actually watch the show it wasn't even necessarily bashing lefties altogether, it was just bashing people who go around always thinking they have everything right and everyone else has it all wrong, and there are no shortage of those types on BOTH sides.",1394755200,3,886,4.36969696969697

5340430,3,B009INAND4,"I have been an admirer of the great Mike Judge for many moons.  His satirical abilities are rare.  Mr. Judge excels at depicting humanity in all its strangeness and in revealing its varied idiosyncratic forms of behavior.
Judge rises above others who have carried out this kind of work because he seems to relish in humanity.  He seems to be engaged with mankind and not merely poking or prodding at people for laughs sake.  To this viewer Mr. Judge seems to love mankind and this resonates with me personally.

While I agree with Mr. Judge's assessment of the Do-Gooders of contemporary America, while I find most of  their aims horrendous and some noble, my feelings about the Goode Family are not of a positive cast.  I will make the careless generalization and presumption that - perhaps - Mr. Judge was not given free reign or complete creative freedom on this project.  I noticed he shared credits with other individuals.  Perhaps I am overly generous out of my love for Mr. Judge's works, but this series seemed onerous to me.

I confess, however, to not having seen the totality of the Goode Family.  I made it perhaps a half dozen episodes into the series before opting to move on to something else.  So I tip my semi-ignorance of this series as a whole work.

Anything Mike Judge does is worthy of my attention be it animated series or live action motion picture.  He is one of the top minds working today in an industry which is questionable at best - to my tastes.",1370995200,,1476,4.583969465648855

The humor and animation were similar in tone and appearance.  This short lived series shows a flip side to the more down-home theme of King of the Hill.  The Goode Family depicted a more liberal, super-environmentally conscious family.  The Goode Family was to the liberal side, as King of the Hill was to the conservative side.  In both series, the viewer of opposing viewpoints can find plenty to laugh at, and anyone with a fair sense of humor on either side can understand the satire and see plenty of honest introspection within the extremes of whatever side their on.  The Goode Family was not preachy even as it addressed what many would consider to be liberal topics and concerns.  I wish the series would have lasted longer!
