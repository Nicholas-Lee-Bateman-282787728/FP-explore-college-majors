Anyway, the documentary is truly  fascinating picture of the artist creating a huge work of art cooperatively. It shows how Tanahata is both very brilliant and given over absolutely  to creating the animation he sees can be; he refuses to play the rules that Miyazaki or anybody else lays out. The process shown is that of a genius who is humbly dedicated to helping others discover the beauty that is there, however long it takes , and then bows in joy, to them, his staff, when it appears as the magnificent ""The Tale of Princess Kaguya"".",1419379200,,650,4.453781512605042
