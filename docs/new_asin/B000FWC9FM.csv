8127556,5,B000FWC9FM,"It's a pity the sequels are not available.  This is an impossible story about a Hong Kong family, each member of which is wacky in one way or another.  The format is 16x9, but the subtitles sometimes straddle the bottom, so it is occasionally hard to follow in full 16x9 mode.  Heck, it's hard to follow regardless, but is so funny it doesn't really matter.",1373068800,,357,4.461538461538462
8127557,5,B000FWC9FM,"Kudos to the studio, actors and crew for a creative storyline. A spoof of everything Chinese. A classic story of switched personalities through some misfortunate events. A comedy of mistakes as each person searches for their proper identities and proper lovers and proper families. A story often told in many cultures this movie pulls out all sorts of creative conundrums to be resolved by our misplaced individuals. Be alert for the contemporary allusions e.g. a rap scene finding it's way into the mix.",1291766400,,504,5.0843373493975905
8127558,4,B000FWC9FM,"Nice to know that Chinese families can be as ravingly insane as American ones, at least in the movies. And in ""All's Well Ends Well"" (no relationship to the Shakespearean play), romantic troubles turn one family topsy-turvy, with plenty of bizarre physical comedy and goofy strife.

The three Shang brothers live with their TVholic parents: successful Moon (Bak-Ming Wong), who has a glamorous mistress and neglects his dutiful, plain wife Ching; swishy So (Leslie Cheung) who has a love-hate relationship with his butch biker cousin Mo-Shang; and sexy Foon (Stephen Chow), a DJ with a girl for every new day -- and a budding interest in pretty Hollyhok (Maggie Cheung), who has a new movie identity every day.

Things start to come unravelled when Moon's affair is found out, Ching moves away, and his housework-impaired mistress moves in. Soon Moon is trying to woo his wife back. Meanwhile, Foon suffers a blow to the head and goes completely insane, with only the angry Hollyhok to care for him. The three brothers's romantic problems come to a head at a party for their parents. Will everyone live happily ever after?

Not very suspenseful, when the ending is basically given away on the DVD box. But the fun of ""All's Well End's Well"" (""Jia you xi shi"") is watching the brothers muddle through their three very different affairs. One is semi-realistic and poignant, one is a funny love-hate one, and one is just outright hilarious. Just watch Chow chase Cheung around the house with a chainsaw.

Director Clifton Ko keeps the laughs coming -- lots of falling, punches, Madonna costumes, electric shocks, foot massages, facial masks, Eiffel tower kisses, and Chow being chased by a baby. But there's also some pathos in the comedy, with Moon trying to woo his ex-wife back, or So and Mo-shang comforting each other when they are both dumped.

The cast is ensemble, and everyone does a good job, but especial props go to Stephen Chow and Maggie Cheung. Chow is especially funny here, either as a suave ladies' man or a lunatic with a meat cleaver, while Cheung is equally hilarious as a girl who pretends to be movie characters. And Sandra Ng is hilarious as the frumpy-housewife-turned-glam-karaoke-DJ.

The ""really mad"" family in ""All's Well Ends Well"" will win you over by the end, with their endless disasters and misunderstandings. Charming, romantic and weird.",1152662400,2,2370,4.942211055276382
