3936631,4,B002IJA69Q,Quite a different take on The Nutcracker.  Great movie with scenes of ballet also. Not just for Christmas time. Loved the owl !,1396396800,3,127,4.521739130434782
3936632,1,B002IJA69Q,This movie is a perversion of the original and it does not enhance it.  It should be called something else not related to nutcracker.,1389398400,,133,4.541666666666667

3936642,5,B002IJA69Q,"This is an artful, fantasy story that is visually and musically entertaining.  It is also a story about faith and following your heart, no matter how scary or worrisome that path may be.  Like the Nutcracker the story leaves room for one's imagination.  I watched it twice because I thought it was delightful.  I understand how others, with expectations of a cheery holiday story or a factual representation of either the Nutcracker ballet or of a holiday during a period of war, might find this story lacking since the movie's description is not very helpful.  But viewed with imagination and an open heart we learn that we are either prisoners of our fears or heroes of our faith.",1418428800,2,682,4.745762711864407

3936647,5,B002IJA69Q,My daughter (15) and I loved it. We have gone downtown to see the Joffrey Ballet perform The Nutcracker for years. This was a great movie tying the beauty of the dance in with a wonderful dramatic storyline.,1417824000,,207,4.473684210526316
3936648,5,B002IJA69Q,"Whole family enjoyed this thoroughly! I have three kids, 8, 5, and 2, and we were all captivated.  It has a wonderful twist, where as in the original there is the Rat King, this is Nazi's (as bears in her imagination).  The little girl is her own heroine, along with her brothers, mother and a friend.  She 'visits' her father in a POW camp(though it's a dream), and helps him keep hope and faith.  It's a great way to introduce young children to history, and it isn't too graphic or scary(and my kids can be a little overly sensitive, we watch mostly just Veggietales).  The one tense part is a close up of the Nazi bear's sharp teeth, but young Clara is triumphant.  The dancing is wonderful, the costumes beautiful, and the storyline caught me completely off guard in the best way!  I am sure that this will be a yearly family favorite, and I would recommend this to ANY family!",1417564800,5,881,4.434782608695652
3936649,5,B002IJA69Q,This is a very sweet movie and recommended for anyone with kids.  Great family movie,1417564800,,84,4.6
3936650,2,B002IJA69Q,This is a father in prison camp WW11 story that is hardly the charming Christmas movie that we looked for as a backdrop to our Christmas activities. There was little of the traditional music either. I could see the how the story was built on the framework of the original but this just wasn't cheerful.,1417392000,,302,4.509090909090909
3936651,1,B002IJA69Q,Great story.  Realy good for kids. And yes I loved too. Try it. I do love the nutcracker anyway.  No matter how it is told.,1417219200,,123,3.88

3936654,3,B002IJA69Q,"Meh, it was okay. Very strange but visually stunning. They rushed the end. The crows and other birds were beautiful.",1416873600,2,116,4.85
3936655,4,B002IJA69Q,I've seen numerous Nutcracker performances over the years.  Obviously theater performances are different but I thought this script was well done.  My kids 2 and 5 enjoyed it as well.,1416441600,3,182,5.033333333333333
3936656,5,B002IJA69Q,Good family movie.,1416441600,,18,5.333333333333333
3936657,3,B002IJA69Q,Nice family oriented film.  The music and dancing are OK if you like that.  The message of the show is deeply hidden.,1416096000,,117,4.2727272727272725

3936662,5,B002IJA69Q,Nice to be able to find an entertaining family movie on prime that we hadn't seen before.  Our 6 year old loved it.,1411257600,,115,4.0

8370987,2,B002IJA69Q,"This version of the Nutcracker is different.  The setting is mostly in Canada during World War 2.  The father is a soldier in a German POW camp.  The uncle is actually and owl from Germany and he has crow henchmen who turn into crows.  But the owl actually turns out to be a good guy.  The whole story is how the soldier's family pines for pines for his return.  I will now ruin the ending in case you want to watch it, but I had a hard time connecting with the characters.  Also I found this version too weird for my tastes.",1419033600,,525,4.088235294117647
8370988,5,B002IJA69Q,"This was a very cute family movie!  There was an intense scene with Nazis imagined to be wolves, so be cautious if you have a sensitive child!",1418947200,,142,4.2592592592592595
8370989,2,B002IJA69Q,Bit trippy. Prefer the classic version.,1418947200,,39,5.666666666666667
