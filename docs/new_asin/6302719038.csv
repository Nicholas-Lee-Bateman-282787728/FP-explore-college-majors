Morricone's score gives you goosebumps and it makes the movie so much more emotional. The reason why people are longing to see this movie on DVD, is that it is a quintessential Spaghetti Western, one of the must see films of the genre, with the music so popular, the star so famous and the finale so memorable, it is a wonder MGM hasn't released this one years ago (this is a copy of my review I wrote at the Spaghetti Western Database, swdb.info)",1203724800,19,587,4.4953271028037385

500209,4,6302719038,Burt Reynolds in the title role takes out revenge on Aldo Sanbrell and his gang in this extremely violent and unsympathetic Spaghetti Western. This film shows off Reynolds' great physique and athletic prowess (circa 1966) under Sergio Corbucci's direction. Ennio Morricone (Leo Nichols) composed a rather over the top pseudo-American Indian score which is just wild. The final confrontation between Reynolds and Sanbrell is so incredible it has to be seen.,993513600,16,456,5.436619718309859
500210,3,6302719038,"Burt Reynolds (before his frantic car chase days)plays a Native-American  Man-With-No-Name in an Italian western straight out of the mid-1960s, when  these things were a fad.  Burt is tight-lipped and stoic as he trails a  band of killers who murdered his wife and other innocent victims in a  ""scalphunter"" raid. The outlaw gang looks like a reunion of  Sergio Leone extras.  The plot is one long search and destroy as  ""Joe"" (a/k/a Burt Reynolds) wreaks havoc on the bad guys.  One  definite strength of the film is the exciting background music, by Ennio  Morricone. (The same composer who did the Clint Eastwood Italian westerns).  Anyway, don't expect a John Ford classic western. The desolate Spanish  countryside is no comparison to Monument Valley.  There is no poetry and  art here.  Only brutal, fast, and violent action, which takes place with  very little fake blood spilling all over the screen.  The final showdown in  the Indian grave-yard has an air of mystery and tragedy as our hero fights  to the death among his ancestors.  The last scene of the riderless Indian  pony manages some slight poignancy.  European westerns, much as Japanese  science-fiction movies, are not for everybody.  Those with the acquired  taste should find this one a likable time-waster.  Love that crazy drumbeat  and human voice combination in the theme music",939340800,11,1354,5.059360730593608
500251,4,6302719038,"""Navajo Joe"" is a spaghetti Western from 1966 starring Burt Reynolds as the titular Native warrior who seeks revenge on a gang of sadistic outlaws who massacred his wife and tribe.

They say Italians have been making the worst movies for a hundred years, but ""Navajo Joe"" is pretty good for a spaghetti oater. In an interview Reynolds admitted that he took Clint Eastwood's example (whom he replaced on the TV series ""Rawhide"") by going to Europe and starring in an Italian Western; unlike Eastwood who got Sergio Leone, however, Burt got Sergio Corbucci. Despite this, Reynolds was in his prime and looks robust; being a stuntman, he did all his own stunts, which is impressive when you view the movie.

Other highlights include the typically outlandish but memorable score by Ennio Morricone (pseudonymously credited as Leo Nichols), which is reminiscent of his later score for ""Burn!"" and raven-haired Nicoletta Machiavelli as Estella, a half-breed who takes a liking to Joe. Other than this, the typical revenge plot moves right along for a fairly entertaining 60's European Western where the dubbed voices don't match the lips. ""Navajo Joe"" may not be great, but it's amusing enough.

The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in Spain.

500252,1,6302719038,"According to imdb dot com, this movie was made in 1966. That was more than 45 years ago and it showed its age.

The acting and directing look childish. For example, in the first 5 minutes, Burt Reynolds as a Western Idian, was able to kill two murderous white guys after  snatching one of the rifles from its owner.

There is nothing worth watching here.",1386374400,,354,4.415384615384616
500253,2,6302719038,"Despite being directed by Django, Companeros and The Great Silence's Sergio Corbucci, Navajo Joe is a rather flat and average Italian Western that would probably be as hard to find today as many of his other lesser westerns if it weren't for an early starring role for Burt Reynolds. Unfortunately Reynolds hadn't quite harnessed his movie star mojo in 1966 and merely makes an adequate rather than iconic hero as the Navajo seeking revenge on Aldo Sambrell's gang of scalphunters who murdered his wife and child. After stealing a train and its $500,000 cargo from them after they kill both the soldiers guarding it and all the passengers, women and babes in arms included, he finds himself rather ineffectually defending a town of second generation immigrants that hates him for not being a proper `American' and going through all the genre staples - picking off the bad guys two-by-two or one-by-one (for no good reason Sambrell never sends enough men to do the job of killing him properly), getting captured and tortured, escaping with the help of the meekest of the supporting cast and finishing off the rest of the baddies.

In principle there's everything you need for a decent actioner here, but it doesn't quite play out that way. None of it is terribly imaginative and the action only sporadically well handled, which may well be a sign of the behind the camera tension. Reynolds reputedly only signed because he thought Sergio Leone was directing and hated every minute of the production and never made any secret of his contempt for the film while Corbucci only signed because he thought Marlon Brando was starring, and at times you can definitely tell that this is a film the two are only making because they're under contract. Corbucci does manage to include a couple of digs about racism and it's nice to see eternal supporting player Sambrell (billed on the English credits as Sanbrell) get a more substantial role for once, and even get a motive for his violence, making far more of an impression than his rather scrawny onscreen nemesis. Ennio Morricone, still being credited as Leo Nichols, turns in a memorably over the top score that turned up again in Tarantino's Kill Bill, and the writers include early Leone collaborator and future poliziotteschi genre cult figure Fernando Di Leo and twice Oscar nominated Ugo Pirro, who co-wrote Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion and The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, but like pretty much everyone else here, this is definitely not one of their better days.

While the UK DVD is cut because of one particularly nasty double-horse fall, the German Blu-ray is uncut and comes with an array of extras, including a trio of featurettes including interviews with assistant director Ruggero Deodato, co-star Nicoletta Machiavelli and Corbucci's widow, a location comparison, German trailer, stills gallery and booklet, but only the American trailer is English-friendly, the featurettes being primarily in Italian with German subtitles. The 2.35:1 transfer is okay but a little underwhelming, with English, Italian or German language options but only German subtitles.",1374796800,2,3128,5.083657587548638

There is only one awkward moment that I can think of and it is one Burt Reynold's lines that just does not come off right. Other than that this has become one of my all time favorite movies. My kids love it as well, just keep in mind that there are several scenes that we make them cover their eyes. I just wish that these type of movies were still being made.

500255,4,6302719038,"This cynical Sergio Corbucci horse opera about the eponymous Native American hero wreaking vengeance on a murderous gang of cutthroat renegades for murdering his woman and massacring his village qualifies as a stalwart, traditional Spaghetti western with nonstop riding, shooting, and killing galore.  Killing constitutes a virtual reflex action in this savage, above-average shoot'em up.  ""Gunsmoke"" actor Burt Reynolds must have been in the best shape of his life to pull off some of his stunts.  He leaps and he lunges as if he were a born acrobat. For example, trussed upside down by the evil villains, he gets a little help from a sneaky city slicker and crunches up to untie his ankles. Remember how Richard Gere did sit-ups dangling by his ankles from the ceiling of his apartment in ""American Gigolo?"" Burt performs similar stunts and is as nimble as a ninja.  Masquerading as Leo Nichols, ""Fistful of Dollars"" composer Ennio Morricone conjures up another memorable, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack with traditional Indian chanting, screaming, and steel string guitar thumping.  Quentin Tarantino thought so much of it and he sampled Morricone's score in his two sword-wielding ""Kill Bill"" sagas.  ""Hercules, Samson, and Ulysses"" lenser Silvano Ippoliti confines all the rampaging violence very skillfully with his widescreen compositions so it looks very cool.  Some of Ippoliti's more imaginative set-ups occur when he obscures the identity of one of the villains during a saloon conference scene.

""Navajo Joe"" is one of a fistful of westerns where the only good Indian isn't a dead one. Few American westerns would celebrate the Native American as Corbucci does in ""Navajo Joe."" Joe is pretty doggoned smart for a savage. Veteran Spaghetti western villain Aldo Sambrell is as treacherous as they come. So filled with hate is he that he kills without a qualm. No sooner has Mervyn 'Vee' Duncan  (Aldo Sambrell of ""For A Few Dollars More"") shot, killed, and scalped Joe's Indian wife than Joe hits the trail in pursuit of Duncan and his gang. Gradually, Joe begins to whittle down the opposition. Meanwhile, Duncan discovers that the authorities in the town of Pyote where he once sold scalps have posted a bounty of both himself and his half-brother.  Just before Duncan's blonde-headed brother Jeffrey (Lucio Rosato of ""4 Dollars of Revenge'') drills the sheriff with his six-shooter, the lawman informs an incredulous Duncan that he is wanted for murder.  Duncan points out that he has been bringing the sheriff the scalps of Indians for years. ""The scalps you brought then were those of troublemakers,"" the lawman points out.  According to the sheriff, things have changed.  ""Now, you're attacking peaceful tribes, killing even the women and the children."" A prominent doctor convinces Duncan to rob a train heading for the town of Esperanza. He warns Duncan not to try and blow up the safe because an explosion will destroy the half-million dollars in the safe. He knows the combination and they can split the loot.  This part of the ""Navajo Joe"" screenplay by ""Fistful of Dollars"" scribe Fernando Di Leo, ""Hills Run Red"" writer Piero Regnoli, and ""Mafia"" scribe Ugo Pirro sounds somewhat like ""For a Few Dollars More"" when Colonel Mortimer persuades El Indio to let him open the safe because too much dynamite might destroy the loot.  Before Duncan leaves town, his gang and he set it ablaze.

Predictably, Joe intervenes and steals the train from Duncan after the villainous dastard has massacred all the passengers, including a woman and her baby, along with the U.S. Army escort. Joe takes the train to Esperanza and offers to liquidate the gang if they will pay him a dollar for each head.  Eventually, Duncan captures Joe and tries to learn the whereabouts of the money, but Joe does not talk. Duncan ranks as one of the most heartless outlaws. He shoots a preacher point blank in the belly with his six-gun after the minister thanks him for not wiping out their town!  This trim 93-minute oater features a lean, mean Burt Reynolds wielding a Winchester like a demon and decimating the ranks of the bad guys. The Spanish scenery looks as untamed as the ruthless desperadoes that plunder one town after another.  ""Django"" director Sergio Corbucci never allows the action to slow down.  Despite its many sterling qualities, ""Navajo Joe"" never achieved the status of other Corbucci westerns like ""The Mercenary,"" ""The Grand Silence"" and ""Companeros."" The no-frills MGM DVD presents the action in widescreen with several languages in subtitles.",1346976000,4,4563,5.0829986613119145
500256,5,6302719038,"I think Navajo Joe was based on a French comic book series by JiJi the mentor of Blueberry's GIR/Mobius.

500258,5,6302719038,"Before Burt Reynolds became a hot property, he went to Italy probably hoping to catch the fire that Clint Eastwood found and made 'NAVAJO JOE' the fifth western by director Sergio Corbucci.  Burt has said in past interviews that its his worst film but he couldn't be more farther from the truth.  It's one of the best spaghetti westerns of the mid sixties with a stellar cast including Fernando Rey and the beautiful Nicoleta Machiavelli as the mute Indian girl who becomes Burt's sidekick.  The true scene stealer is the awesome Aldo Sambrell as Duncan, the leader of a band of outlaws who are getting paid for Indian scalps and who stops at nothing to try to bring down Burt. Corbucci delivers the goods with non stop action throughout its running time.  The music score is under the direction of the master, Ennio Morricone, who is billed under an alias ,Leo Nichols, which he also used for his excellent score for Corbucci's 'THE HELLBENDERS' released the same year.  MGM gives the release a pristine widescreen transfer, lets hope they release 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' and 'GUNS FOR SAN SEBASTIAN' in the near future with the same quality.  This film is one of my favorite guilty pleasures which I find myself coming back to on repeated viewings.

500259,4,6302719038,"Here's one for CB:

Navajo Joe is one of the lesser talked about Sergio Corbucci films.  Though a good movie, it is a easy to see why it's never mentioned alongside Django, Companeros or The Great Silence.  It does seem a bit more like a Hollywoodized project, as though Corbucci didn't have as much input as usual, and was more or less along for the ride.
In the movie, Joe is hell bent(for leather!) for revenge against a murderous gang that kills a bunch of Native Americans(including Joe's woman).  He gets a good opportunity to stick it to them when a small town asks for his help in defending them from the evil gang, which is coming to town to get a large stash of cash.  It's the typical spaghetti western kind of plot.  Joe is very much the type of character you'd expect from the genre-A cool, calm badazz who doesn't talk much, takes no crap and whoops butt.  The few Native American characters are played by obvious white folks with darkened skin to make them look ""native"", but this was quite common at the time.  I'm not sure how easy it is to buy Burt Reynolds as a Navajo warrior, but it's easy enough to at least buy him as a western hero.
Navajo Joe is a good time if you dig them spaghetti westerns, and you should!!  After all, you're not a commie, are ya?

Background trivia:
Burt Reynolds only agreed to make this film because he was under the impression that Sergio Leone would be directing. When he found out it was Sergio Corbucci he tried to pull out, but the contracts had already been signed and it was too late.

Apparently, during the production of this movie, director Sergio Corbucci drove Burt Reynolds deep into Spain's Almerian Desert and then drove off leaving him there to walk back to town.

Burt Reynolds once described this movie as being ""so awful, it was shown only in prisons and airplanes because nobody could leave. I killed 10,000 guys, wore a Japanese slingshot and a fright wig.""

Burt Reynolds wore a black hairpiece for this film.

When director Sergio Corbucci was approached to make this movie, Marlon Brando was touted as the star. By the time production started the lead had been given to Burt Reynolds. Reynolds and Corbucci did not get along at all.

The horse belonging to Navajo Joe was made to look like a pinto. It was actually a dapple gray, but was partially painted to resemble a pinto..

Burt Reynolds has joked about his dislike of this movie by referring to the film's director Sergio Corbucci as being the ""wrong Sergio"". Sergio Leone is the most internationally famous director of many of the successful spaghetti westerns including the Dollars Trilogy. Moreover, there was also another Sergio who directed spaghetti westerns, Sergio Sollima.

A former stuntman, Burt Reynolds supervised the stunts on this picture.

Producer Dino De Laurentiis made this spaghetti western with the intention of replicating the success of A Fistful of Dollars (1964) after that movie had become a box-office hit. De Laurentiis wanted to find an American actor to rival Clint Eastwood's popularity. Burt Reynolds had appeared in TV westerns and was part Cherokee Indian. De Laurentiis persuaded him to sign on.

Burt Reynolds has said, in numerous interviews and discussions, that this movie was the worst professional experience he ever had.

One of Quentin Tarantino's Top Twenty favorite spaghetti westerns.

This movie's working title was 'A Dollar a Head'.

In both of the western films in which Burt Reynolds plays an Indian character, he is called Joe. He is Navajo Joe in his film and Yaqui Joe Herrera in 100 Rifles (1969).

The only ""spaghetti western"" Burt Reynolds ever made.

Part Cherokee Indian, Burt Reynolds plays a Navajo Indian in this movie. He had previously played Indian characters. In the western series Gunsmoke (1955) he played half-Indian blacksmith Quint Asper for several seasons. He played New York City Detective Lt. John Hawk, a full-blooded Iroquois Indian, in the police series Hawk (1966).

Apparently, actress Nicoletta Machiavelli complained about the amount of dialogue she had in this picture and added that she felt that she didn't have a sense of place in the picture.

Although this was Burt Reynolds' second film as a lead actor, it was still booked into ""B"" movie theaters and drive-ins as a second-feature on its initial US release.

Apparently, director Sergio Corbucci maintained that the plot was based on historical fact, referring to the U.S. government's policy in some areas of the Southwest of putting a bounty on Indian scalps.

The Navajo are an Indian tribe in the southwestern US. They are also known as the Din tribe and are the second largest Native American tribe in North America.

The score composed by Ennio Morricone was re-used in the later movies Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) and Election (1999).

For the production of this film, a miniature Western town was constructed on the environs of the old railway station at Guadix, Spain. The De Laurentiis movie studios did not have a western town set on their back-lot nor did Colmenar Viejo have a railway.",1465516800,5,3846,4.9796875
