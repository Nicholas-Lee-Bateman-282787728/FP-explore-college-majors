8738099,5,B0175ZO6F2,"I loved this live chronicle that samples Jobson's career. Seeing him perform some of his Zinc ""Green"" album is an absolute treat.",1507680000,,129,4.909090909090909
8738101,5,B0175ZO6F2,"Great footage of a unique concert, going through Eddie's varied 4 decades in rock. High standard visuals and audio. Nice to see him working with likes of Sonja Kristina of Curved Air again. 40 years on from when Jobson joined Curved Air at 17',then went on to play with Roxy, Zappa, Tull before forming UK",1474934400,,305,4.5636363636363635
8738103,2,B0175ZO6F2,"Blueray is great and would get 4 stars but cd mix is substandard, murky sometimes and almost sounds like a reasonable bootleg. Overpriced",1468713600,,137,5.0
8738104,5,B0175ZO6F2,"Here we have the visual version of the epic concert that Eddie Jobson compiled and performed in Kanagawa, Japan back in 2013.  If you read my review of the 2 disc CD , you'll get an idea of what the music was like.  This Blu-Ray is worth every penny and captures the energy and intensity that went into the performance. The quality is flawless.  You have a choice of different audio sound and because it is all region , your choice of subtitles. BEWARE!!  Do not purchase the 2 disc CD release if you purchase the Blu-Ray because it is included in the package and you will wind up spending more for naught just like I did.  There are no extras , the Blu-Ray encompasses the same content as the CD. The price is incredibly steep but, after all, you are getting 3 discs of a superb concert experience.  Any one who loves this type of music deserves to have this in their collections.",1466294400,3,881,4.341463414634147
