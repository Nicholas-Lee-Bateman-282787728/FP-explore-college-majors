5170572,5,B008NBJ9TQ,"Wonderful!!!!!  True love prevails in the end. A classic tale of Muslim and Hindu romance. There are tricks, scandal, honor, violence and political power in this love that is divided by religion and greed for power.  Its a classic Romeo and Juliet meets honor killings and struggle two families who give a hoot of what society thinks of their children.  I love it! If you love Romeo and Juliet you will love Ishaqzaade!",1404259200,,419,4.712328767123288

5170576,5,B008NBJ9TQ,"As the actors are new comers, I knew I was taking a chance in purchasing this film.  It was a chance that I am glad I took.  I was a good twenty minutes into the movie when I realized that the plot seemed familiar to me. The movie is a version of Romeo and Juliet.  The actor, Arjun Kapoor, seems as though he's done this before.  There was no overacting, no cheesiness.  The actress, Parineeti Chopra, also did a great job.  I really liked her character, Zoya.  The girl she plays in the movie is fierce.  She and Parma (Arjun's character) are like the male and female versions of each other.  It makes sense they fell in love.  They are both passionate and impulsive.  They both have hair trigger tempers.  Parma is a rich kid who is trying to live up to his grandfather's expectations, to no avail.  This causes him to act recklessly.  Zoya is the only daughter, amongst sons, of doting parents.  She has aspirations of entering politics.  Both have hated each other since childhood due to family political rivalry.  At the beginning of the movie, all the way up to the intermission, Parma is not that likeable.  Zoya herself, while more likeable, was no wilting flower.  She would pull a gun in the blink of an eye.  She could use a lesson in impulse control.  The twist between the two in the middle of the movie is something that I did not see coming.  That's saying something for Bollywood movies, which can be kind of predictable.  After the intermission, the two must grow up a little and cooperate.  As I am not from that part of the world, it took me a while to figure out that the families were against the relationship not just for political reasons but also for religious reasons.  I don't really understand such passionate disapproval, although I do know that those views exist in the world.  The amount of gunfire employed to show their disapproval was astounding.  Also, I was baffled that both families so readily rejected their previously beloved children over this issue.  I know that exists in the world too, but still, it is baffling to me.  Having said all that, I really enjoyed this movie.  The songs were really good.  There wasn't too much joyous dancing, which would have been out of place in such a plot.  The acting by Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra was super for two people who are new to the profession. The ending was a surprise, given how Bollywood, like Hollywood, loves happy endings.  But, it fit the movie.  I like a movie that keeps me thinking about it after the movie has ended.",1349481600,5,2522,4.5311111111111115
5170577,4,B008NBJ9TQ,"Ishaqzaade is set in a small town where progressivism is yet to make a mark, This is the city of Almore ( actually Lucknow and Uttarakhand) where political parties rule the old fashioned way with guns. Two warring families are the Qureshis and Chauhans, their rivalry is fierce in the local political stakes and they have the entire region divided by religion. Querishis have a daughter Parineeti Chopra and the son of the Chauhan clan fall in love..Parma is a guy who has daddy issues and wants to be the person to be depended on in the family, he also has a slight speech impediment calling Zoya as Joya....Zoya too has ambitions of her own to become the local MLA.The proceedings seem to be run of the mill obvious but there is a twist right before the interval and makes you sit up.
The story line reminded me of QSQT but the treatment is fresh and the young actors are just amazing. Arjun Kapoor is the nephew of Anil Kapoor and the son of Boney Kapoor, and has acting in his genes. This did not seem to be his first movie. I want to see him in the next film Mr. India 2. Look out for him. Parineeti Chopra is a reluctant entrant to the world of film and had actually wanted to be an accountant, but she is made for films and is phenomenal in this one. She is a cousin of Priyanka Chopra.
Habib Faisal direct quite alright but there are times when the timing and the force could have been a bit more tighter to make a greater impact. This skill can be improved with time and I hope he is able to deliver more fresher screenplays such as this one. I will definitely visit his earlier film Do Dooni Char.
The most hyped music director Amit Trivedi delivers a ear pleasing soundtrack, I loved Jhallah walla, Ishaqzaade and Chokra Jawaan.
The rest of the cast is new and lend good support. Watchable film. 4 stars",1348358400,3,1814,4.353982300884955

8529111,5,B008NBJ9TQ,"Amazing movie, phenomenal acting by the leads, a suspenseful and shocking love story between warring families.  You are captivated every moment.",1524528000,,144,5.857142857142857
8529112,4,B008NBJ9TQ,"In this movie, The 'Chauhans' (Hindu) and the 'Qureshis' (Muslims) are two political families whose rivalry and mutual hatred for one another goes back generations. Parma (Played by Arjun Kapoor) is a Goonda (local thug) who is the grandson of the the male head of the family. His grandfather often shouts at Parma for being the useless son of his widowed daughter-in-law, and this makes Parma try to prove himself worthy and usually does illegal things to fit in the family. Zoya (Acted by Parineeti Chopra), shown as a 'Muslim' religion girl but educated and modern but hot-tempered, only daughter in a traditional Muslim house full of many brothers, along with her parents. She desires to go into politics like her father, but this dream of hers is constantly laughed at by her family since she is a woman.

Election season starts, Parma and Zoya's canvassing efforts leads into a clash between them, which results in Parma being slapped across the face by Zoya. While Parma is having a liking by Zoya's fearlessness, Zoya is intrigued by his charm and love story starts...No more spoilers here But religion comes in the way of their lives and fight starts... While this nothing new in India when it comes to fight between two religions but this is another example of excellent performance by Parineeti Chopra which kept me glue to the scenes.

Overall nice movie worthy of four stars!",1519430400,,1388,4.852320675105485

While watching, I couldn't help compare Ishaqzaade in my head to another Romeo-and-Juliet inspired film to come out of Bollywood recently, Ram-Leela. They are very different films, and I think each has it's own flaws. Ram-Leela's much-needed emotional core got lost, rendering all its stunning visuals hollow. Ishaqzaade, on the other hand, suffered from having an utterly unlikeable male lead who soured the romance beyond redemption.

Non-specific spoilers ahead.
The revelation that comes in the mid-point of the movie was not necessarily the moment where Parma lost all hope of sympathy from me. Had the filmmakers played their cards right, they could have painted a moving story of Parma's internal conflict, his desire to please his family vs his desire to live his own life, without sacrificing the shock of the betrayal. When the reality of Parma's actions hit him, when he realized how utterly he had destroyed Zoya's life, he should have undergone a crisis. The second half of the movie should have been spent exploring Parma's gradual acceptance and understanding of Zoya's faith and personhood, maturing, and proving himself worthy of her. What actually ensued was completely hollow and two-dimensional: Parma demands her forgiveness so that his conscience can be eased and never once does anything to deserve it or prove that he understands what his actions have done to her. Parma sees Zoya praying once and then accepts that she's a Muslim. Parma calls Zoya pretty and so she forgives him for his horrible betrayal. It was completely unsatisfying and left me feeling frustrated with Zoya and hating Parma. I was never convinced that he had any true feelings for her, and thus the end of the movie was almost a relief: at least Zoya could be free of his shallowness and manipulativeness. Zoya, on the other hand, was a much more dynamic character. She went from wanting Parma to convert to accepting him for who he was; she went from being scornful and rude to Chaand to defending Chaand and the other girls from Parma, and all of it in a much more natural and believable fashion.

The fact that both Zoya and Parma's mother had to have their lives destroyed for Parma to grow at all, and the fact that THAT growth then felt so unconvincing, was really unfortunate. I think that the premise of this movie (the two families being divided by religion) was more compelling than Ram-Leela's, but if I spent the whole time wanting Juliet to shoot Romeo then I think that the film has failed. I don't necessarily regret watching it, but I would not recommend.",1488067200,,2581,4.9016018306636155
