7363777,3,B013FA08H6,"Some nice footage of wildlife and scenery around Baja California and very brief discussion of its ecological significance and challenges. The tie in to Steinbeck's 1939 journey was interesting, but too much footage from WW II was included to provide context, I guess. But so what ? Film did not really develop any of its subjects in depth, so overall it was disappointing.",1455580800,,372,4.920634920634921
7363778,4,B013FA08H6,"Nearly gets the full five stars, but got diverted into some pretty extraneous material at a few points. But when this docu-travelogue focused on retracing the trip that John Steinbeck and his friend Ed Ricketts made down the west California/Mexico coast, east around Los Cabos and into the Sea of Cortez, it was excellent. Quoting Steinbeck and connecting those words of 75 years ago to what we are facing today, ecologically, was also a masterstroke. And the cinematography was usually superb. I would recommend this less-than-an-hour-long documentary to fans of Steinbeck, literature, travel adventure, biology, and conservation, without reservation.",1447200000,3,652,5.595959595959596

7363781,5,B013FA08H6,having read the Log from the Sea of Cortez (if I've correctly recalled the title from 40+ years ago) I found the movie to be just fantastic in accuracy etc.  I'll watch it many times.,1465948800,,183,4.228571428571429

8727429,4,B013FA08H6,"Sea of Cortez (aka Gulf of California) is documented in this film in graceful, mystical fashion with shimmering photography, intelligent writing, lilting narration.  Thomas Lucas, writer-director, is to be congratulated.  His work is filled with quotation from John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts, whose book on this body of water makes cosmic connections between sea, stars and mind and human effort to transform the world.  Admittedly, one may nod off at times, but will reopen his eyes to the blue-tinged waters active with light and life.  Many aspects of ecology and history of the region are touched upon and given meaning by the well-crafted sentences from Steinbeck and Ricketts.  Superb, recommended to all seekers for a higher truth in things, even sea lions, manta rays and hammerhead sharks . . . tide-pools, mountain springs, sand and stars.",1480032000,,853,5.242647058823529

8727431,5,B013FA08H6,"When the information is tied to the saga of a sailing trip by famous people it becomes even more interesting to me. We own condos in Mexico along the Sea of Cortez, so this topic was right up my line anyway.",1474329600,,207,4.073170731707317
8727432,3,B013FA08H6,Just ok.  Very monotone.  Lots about the non sea in the area,1473638400,,60,3.9166666666666665
