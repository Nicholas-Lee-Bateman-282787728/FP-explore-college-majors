5647677,5,B00BMQODBI,"The TV series is one of my grandson's favorites, but he cannot always see it, because of the time it airs.  These videos were a perfect gift for him.  I have watched them with him and find them to be enjoyable entertainment for kids with no violence.  They also get kids interested in different subject areas.",1390953600,4,309,4.482142857142857

5647680,5,B00BMQODBI,"My family was given the opportunity to review the new release ""Dino Dan: Dino 4 Pack"" from NCircle, and it has been a complete hit in my house! I have three boys ranging in age from two to seven years old, and they all enjoy watching Dino Dan episodes. This DVD set includes four discs with five episodes on each for a total running time of about four hours. There are some neat bonus features as well. Three of the DVDs have been released previously, but one is brand new. The four DVDs that are included are ""To Catch a Dino"", ""Dino Trackers"", ""Ready? Set? Dino!"" and the never before seen ""Cretaceous Creatures"". The new DVD includes episodes titled ""Masked Confusion"", ""Lunch Bag Bandit"", ""Dino Doug"", T-Rex Bedtime"" and ""Active Imagination"". My boys have favorite episodes on different discs, so it is nice to have the set for variety. This show is so great because it teaches kids how to use investigation techniques and solve problems. I also really appreciate that many of the episodes emphasize cooperation and teamwork between Dan and his younger brother. I feel like Dino Dan really encourages kids use their imagination and be creative. Overall, this is a great DVD set for any kid who loves dinosaurs and enjoys a little detective work.",1386201600,28,1249,4.73394495412844

5647683,5,B00BMQODBI,My 4 year old grandson is very interested and eager to learn about dinosaurs.  Dino Dan has great stories and educates him by showing the dinosaurs in action; and not with violence and bloodshed.  I like the fact that these stories are inquiries into dinosaurs existence with the imagination of a young boy.  They are creative stories that are cute and educational.  We have really enjoyed these DVDs.,1381795200,12,401,4.852941176470588
5647684,5,B00BMQODBI,"My 3 year old absolutely loves this. Its a mixed blessing however since he wants to watch it ALL THE TIME. I'm personally not a huge fan. But he sure is!!! Great for putting on to keep him entertained while I do other stuff. Being in the same room with the cheesy dialog and theatrics makes me a little nauseous. But it's not FOR me, it's for him.
