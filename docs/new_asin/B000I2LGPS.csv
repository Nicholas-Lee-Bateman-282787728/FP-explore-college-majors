8143819,2,B000I2LGPS,I loved Rebelde when it came out on TV here.  I have been waiting a long time for the 1st season to come out with english subtitles. However I would not have purchased it if i had known it wasn't complete.  They cut off so many scenes it realyl doens't make any sense. On each disk the scenes run together (not like a TV show DVD usually works).  I wish I could get my money back and wait for a better version.  i would have paid more for a complete season than 20 bucks on this piece of junk.  Save your money and wait.,1170374400,5,520,3.9615384615384617
8143820,2,B000I2LGPS,"i loved the telenovela when it came out on tv so naturally,  i was super excited when i saw that the dvd of the first season was out.  that excitement was premature.  there was a GOOD amount of stuff CUT OUT OF THE DVDs. I would say at least a good hours worth of content was missing from the show.  And a couple of the things they cut out where pretty important.  I have absolutely no idea why they did this,  but if i had known it,  i probably would NOT have gotten the dvd.  I'm waiting for the non import to come out and hopefully get my missing scenes back :(

cuando vi que tenian el dvd de la primera temporada de rebelde en venta,  estaba super emocionada pero se me quito cuando me di cuenta de que habian cortado esenas que habia visto en la television.  y no eran babosadas que quitaron de los discos,  si no fueron cosas integras al show.  yo deria que fue como por lo menos una hora entera que quitan del disco.

digo yo que es mejor ha esperar que salga el otro dvd de la primera temporada.",1166745600,5,1014,4.1020408163265305
