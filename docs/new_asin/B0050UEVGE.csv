8451852,5,B0050UEVGE,The fifth one is a classic. Jeff Burr did a marvelous job directing this. Chandra West had the best role and performance. I love the new creative puppets in this one. Going against the evil puppets. I love the series. Keep creating Charles Band.,1518652800,,245,4.590909090909091

8451856,2,B0050UEVGE,"Part 5 marks the most noticeable drop in quality of any other franchise installments and is the first of the series that I might suggest you skip.  It's just more of part 4 with almost none of the fun.

SEQUEL SIDEBAR:  Puppet Master III (1991; set in 1941 and having the highest production value of the first three franchise installments) is actually a prequel to Puppet Master (1989), which occurs decades later in present day and is seamlessly followed story-wise by Puppet Master II (1991; which was the least serious, most zany installment).  Puppet Master 4 (1993) returns us to present day after Puppet Master II.  Part 5 picks up right where part 4 ended.

In Puppet Master 4, B-horror sequel director Jeff Burr (Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings, Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Stepfather 2) introduced us to a silly new villain and an even sillier premise: some netherworld demon lord named Sutec was sending gremlins after the now-turned-good puppets and anyone who knew their secret of eternal life.  The movie ended with a blatant revelation to the audience that a sequel was planned before this movie even hit the shelves.  So, with part 5, the story continues.

Robot and artificial intelligence engineer Rick (Gordon Currie; Friday the 13th Part VIII, The Terror Within II, Puppet Master 4), now wrongly charged with the murders of his friends and co-workers, reviews the events of Puppet Master 4 wherein he learned about Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe; Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4 and Retro Puppet Master, Dolls, The Bride), reanimation, the demon lord Sutec and the puppets.

As Rick makes bail and rejoins his girlfriend Susie (Chandra West; White Noise, Puppet Master 4), Sutec is reanimating his apparently dead demon ""son"" in a ritual that intermittently eats up the first 30 minutes of the movie, metaphysicist and psychic-channeler Lauren (Teresa Hill; Puppet Master 4) is in critical condition in the hospital and sending telepathic instant messages to Rick's computer, and the guy who bailed Rick out of jail leads a team of goons to find the puppets so that they can profit from them.  It all moves along pretty slow (unlike all of the other Puppet Master installments).

The goons looking for the puppets provide the kill fodder in this movie. They encounter puppets who pick them off and hit them in the nuts with meat tenderizers, and find nether-gremlin demons which suck their souls in the name of Sutec.  We also see Sutec's ""child,"" which is really just another gremlin but with a necklace and the added ability to teleport (I suppose) through solid objects.  This little fiend seems hardly more menacing than the gremlins from Puppet Master 4.

The puppets featured in this movie include Pinhead, Tuneler and Jester (all five movie veterans), Six-Shooter (from parts 1 and 4), Torch (from part 3, but strangely not part 4) and Decaptiron (from part 4), who gets a brand new head attachment and continues to deliver Toulon's awkward messages from beyond the grave--I think.  However, I'm confused as to whether Toulon is a spirit, or still reanimated from part 2, or what.  We saw him skulking around the hotel in part 4, but also sending his spiritual messages through Decapitron.  Hmmm?

The final showdown between the puppets and the sorcery-wielding son of Sutec is nothing special. Although, Six-Shooter gets some great stop-motion gun slinging action.  They aimed for a climax, but any cartoon episode pitting Mum-Ra against the Thundercats would prove much more exciting.  The closing scene is similarly cheesy and lame.

Eh, you could skip it.  I love a lot of lame horror and I barely got through this.  However, I did it without the entertainment support of friends and beer.",1365120000,,3729,4.967793880837359
8451857,5,B0050UEVGE,"As we draw near to the end of our annual Octoberfest horror festivus, we pack in yet another of the Puppet Master series. Number 5 was created to close out the series in great fashion, but it was short lived as the obvious demand for killer puppets raged on. There has since been many additions to the series which have all been somewhat less than stellar. However that's a non-concern at the moment as right now we're dealing with him. Going the Full Moon route is always going to be a gamble depending on your expectations. As for the 80's up until the mid 90's, Full Moon provided some classic B horror gems. Included in these gems is the Puppet Master series,Charles Band's bread and butter by far. In fact the residual earnings were probably the one thing that kept him from working the night shift at Kangaroo in the 2000's. Sure in the later years there were a few Joe Estevez appearances, but even Uncle Joe can't compete with the puppet crew.

Puppet Master 5 starts off conveniently where #4 ended. Rick Myers is being interrogated ""Jessup"" style after the murders of his scientist buddies. He tries to tell them how a creature from the underworld was sent there to finish them, but obviously they think he's a total nutbar. Despite not believing him they let him out after some guy named Dr. Jennings posts his bail. It seems he's interested in the story Rick told about Puppets coming to life and figures the bail posting will lead to finding out the secret to bringing inanimate objects to life. Once they get back to the Toulon Inn the choas insues like Chuck on flag football game day. The underworld has released a tag team of the lizard looking creatures for round two. It get's tense for a while there, but the Puppets leap into action and kick the tar out of the creatures. Whoa...that was close. In the end the spirit of Andre Toulon makes an appearance passing the baton to Rick Myers to continue caring for the puppets. Too bad the guy can't find any friends outside a crew of wooden puppets.

Puppet Master V was a perfect installment from the series, and a seemingly great way to close things out. It was everything that a direct to video horror from 94 should be. The story line is nothing short of absurd, but that only adds to the charm. In 3,4 & 5 the puppets had taken more of a heroic roll as opposed to their terrorizing ways in 1 & 2. So in a way the writing, though quite poorly done and hilarious, provided a nice amount of depth. It holds the killer puppets in a new light. It's jam packed with puppet on tiny creature battle action with plenty of bad acting and a heavy dose of ""the feel."" We strongly suggest checking out Puppet Master 5 as soon as you can. You can trust us as we watch B for the American working man because that's who we are, and that's who we care about.",1351209600,,2811,4.403846153846154
8451858,5,B0050UEVGE,"The Final Chapter as I've read Puppet master 5 is sometimes called was the last of the great Puppetmaster movies that I've seen. While Axis of Evil came out after the video stores in my area closed down so I've never seen that one I didn't really care much for the films beyond this one.  Picking up where movie 4 WHEN BAD PUPPETS TURN GOOD we have new Puppet master Rick  blamed for the deaths in the 4th installment of the series. The Omega Project men want the dolls for themselves to learn their secrets for themselves. Naturally the puppets fight back against The Omega Project men until they all have to team up against the Egyptian God Sutec. Like Puppet Master 1, 2, and 4 the majority of the film takes place in the abandoned hotel which has been my favorite set location for this series. We  even have some dream sequences that flashback scenes of previous Puppet master films.  This is a must for any lover of the Puppet Master movies.",1331510400,3,946,4.4508670520231215
