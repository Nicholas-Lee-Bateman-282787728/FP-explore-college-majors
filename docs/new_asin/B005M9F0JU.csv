4834286,5,B005M9F0JU,"Esta pelcula es una de las cuales todos devn ver. Empieza con un nio abandonado por su mama drogadicta y es llevado por una amiga a quedarse unos dias con una pareja homosexual.
Esta pelicula toma el tema tabu de la homosexualidad ante la sociedad latina. En el transcurso de la pelicula, otro tipo de familia se va formando no como la formula tradicional pero si entre varios adultos que velan por el bien estar de el nio.

Mira un trailer por internet y te daras cuenta que la quieres ver.",1341619200,,491,4.395604395604396
4834287,5,B005M9F0JU,"Great Movie. Una pelicula excelente!
Te ayuda a tener una mejor perspectiva a cerca de la familia ""normal."" De una manera, la pelicula es muy educativa y logra transmitir un mensaje en donde no todos buscan de verdad el bienestar de los mas debiles; los nios. Yo recomiendo que vean esta pelicula.*****",1336348800,,302,4.826923076923077

4834289,5,B005M9F0JU,"La otra familia (The Other Family  128 minutes)

This isn't a telenovela but features actors I have come to love in that genre, namely Jorge Salinas (""La que no poda amar""), Luis R. Guzmn (Alborada), Nailea Norvind (Cuidado con el ngel ) and Ana Serradilla (El poder del amor).

The major players:
* Jorge and Luis play a gay couple who chum around with a lesbian couple.
* Nailea is a drug-addicted friend with a seven-year-old son. She leaves him alone for days at a time, so...
* Ana (one of the lesbians) asks the guys to hide him at their place (they are wealthy and can accommodate him).

This turns into an unpredictable, complicated chain of events that involves the guys' maid, their gardener, the lesbian couple, an unhappily married pair who just lost a baby boy and a drug dealer who keeps our little boy's mother hooked. This cabron figures out how to sell the boy to pay off the drug supplier, so he contacts the couple who just lost the baby.

All of the acting is good and I came to care a great deal about what was going to happen to the little boy! Expect really tough language (there are drug addicts in this one) and nudity. You'll see same-sex situations but no hard-core stuff. And that nice little boy deserves better than he has had so far!

My DVD came from the library but as soon as it was over, I came in here and ordered my own copy from Amazon.",1403222400,,1374,4.34765625

4834292,5,B005M9F0JU,This movie will make you realize that people get misjudged by the most ignorant beings. They seem to have no knowledge of what happiness or love truly means.

8479206,5,B005M9F0JU,"A delight. The movie was a surprise for the way in which it dealt with a gay couple dealing with the sudden intrusion into their lives of a small boy... what made it special and different is that this wasn't a film  with an LA or NYC story line but Mexico City with all of the freight that comes along with a society steeped in machismo, drugs, violence, and open hostility to homosexuality dealing honestly with each of these topics. Superb acting, excellent production quality.",1440720000,,479,4.635294117647059

Highly recommend to those new to the LGBTQ community and to parents who are having difficulty accepting their children's sexual orientation.

I appreciate the fact that as little as possible is made of the couple's homosexuality, although the unhappy couple clearly thinks they can provide a ""better"" home, but won't say it out loud because it would be politically incorrect. I was relieved at the ending and know that the little boy will thrive. I got this DVD through Amazon.",1403827200,,1374,4.45816733067729
