8027867,5,B0002G6TQG,I bought this as a gift but reviewed the videos before I give them out. They appear to be better than some I've looked at however the person who received them hasn't used them once. You can lead a horse to water...,1525392000,,214,4.119047619047619

8027869,5,B0002G6TQG,"About a year and a half ago I was in a car accident (not my fault of course) and shortly after the accident I was having extreme back pain and was later diagnosed with some herniated discs which would be a problem the rest of my life.  Upon the advice of my Uncle I bought a Pilates DVD to start strengthening my back, power house (core) and other various parts of my body.  I had seen other Yoga and Pilates videos and they were always hosted by women and they made it seem like the exercises would be a snap.  Unfortunately for men, we are a bit stiffer than women and generally lack the flexibility to even remotely feel like we're doing the exercises right.

To make a long review short -- Alicia Wyatt is great (along with Phil and Ted?) and she really walks you through the exercises and addresses the needs of men.  It is a short video which is great and has the options of a 30 min workout, 15 min workout and 10 min workout. It has improved my back by 500% and I am amazed at how much better feel. (I was also amazed that Pilates was invented by a man! Who knew?)

I would buy this again in a heartbeat and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone interested.  (on a side note if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up-- thanks:)",1330128000,20,1247,4.149377593360996
8027870,5,B0002G6TQG,"I bought this for my man who has not worked out for several years though was previously fit.  We do this together (I have a lot of pilates experience but still find this effective because its the old-fashioned exercises that really work) and he constantly comments on what a difference it makes in his alignment and how he feels when sitting at his desk job.  We love the quick and basic 5 minute routine and are working our way up to the longer ones.  He usually prefers the basic calisthenics or martial arts type of dvds but warmed up to this right away after trying it and experiencing how effective it is.  I love it, too!  The instructor is easy to follow and the regular-type guys help less flexible guys realize they can do this, too!  I think it is missing a more in-depth section on finding your core muscles for the most effective use of pilates.  Despite this, I think the dvd's user-friendliness really makes it 5 stars.",1323820800,2,933,4.485207100591716

I got this DVD for my brother as a gift. He's a big-wig politician in DC, always flying from place to place and not prioritizing his health (he has a bad back at 40). I doubted that he'd use it, but lo' and behold . . . he calls me and tells me he loves this DVD!

He takes it with him when he travels which actually makes it easy for him to work out - and tells me his back is better than ever with the core strengthening excercises.

Next thing you  know . . . what do I get in the mail for my birthday - my poli-brother sends ME THE DVD too! Not a girl-one, but the ""Pilates for Men DVD."" Included was a little note from him, challenging me to try it too. Well . . . I did and it was fun! Challenging, but easy to follow, good music . . . and my abs are finally starting to show.

I'm sending this to my Mom next!",1258761600,4,826,3.7241379310344827
8027872,2,B0002G6TQG,"This DVD relates to Pilates the same way as fast food relates to real food. The emphasis is on speed not quality . The exercises switch quickly from one to the next with minimal instruction and , worst of all, with a minimal warmup. Some things just take a little time , and I believe pilates is one of them. Pilates is like good sex, it shouldn't be rushed. If you can't spare more than 5 minutes for a pilates workout you have a problem that pilates isn't going to solve. I would reccommend the Lindsay Jackson ""Pilates for Men"" DVD. Sure, the workout takes about an hour but it has a good 15 minute warmup, good instructions and seems well balanced and structured.",1254787200,4,667,4.387096774193548
8027873,5,B0002G6TQG,"This is a very nicely organized DVD featuring various effective Pilates routines comprising beginner and intermediate level incl. a nice strong push up series. The full workout takes only 30 min and leaves me sweating and relaxed as a standalone workout or in combination with some running. Alisa Wyatt is an attractive and motivating instructor. I use this DVD 3-4 times a week in conjunction with D. Lyon's wonderful book ""Pilates for Men"" and alternate with regular practice of Ashtanga Yoga ""David Swenson - The Practice Manual"".",1201046400,11,533,5.137931034482759
8027874,5,B0002G6TQG,"I love pilates, but I don't think most programs are very ""male-friendly"".  This has ""real"" guys, not fitness models doing the exercises and it takes into consideration our tight hamstrings and hips.  There's no pressure to look pretty or look like a dancer with this one!  I actually think this could be a unisex dvd.",1198454400,14,317,4.7272727272727275
8027875,5,B0002G6TQG,"This DVD has made a tremendous improvement in my core strength and flexibility, which I notice when doing routine tasks as well as doing my full workout at the gym.  I've tried pilates classes, mostly with women, and was discouraged until I got this DVD.  Other DVDs that I tried had instructors who assumed that muscle flexiblity in men was a non-issue.  Alisa Wyatt is great because the emphasis is on how pilates can address men's issues, such as tight hamstrings.  John and Phil are ""regular guys"", who help reinforce that Pilates isn't just for the super flexible.  Also, the DVD is more informal, a thankful change from the ""yoga-esque"" or ""new-age-esque"" theme that you see in so many other DVDs or classes.

I use this DVD every other day, on off days when I don't go to the gym.  It is a great compliment and supplement to other workouts.  I hope that Alisa will make another Pilates for Men DVD for the next skill workout skill level.",1160092800,25,944,4.5773809523809526
8027876,5,B0002G6TQG,"After viewing a number of pilates programs for prenatal and postnatal, I finally stumbled across this DVD.  The DVD offers a 5 minute, 10 minute, 15 minute, and 26 minute workouts.  The full 26 minute workout provides about 26 different pilates moves along with a push up series.  The instruction is good and more importantly brief.  The series does move quickly, but offers a good workout.",1155859200,21,390,4.863636363636363
