I only wish that it had come with a little booklet with a timeline, names of players, etc. Definitely a ""must see"" for all you Mariners' fans!!",1207526400,,287,4.236363636363636
7914605,5,B00001P4OE,"As a longtime Seattle baseball fan, I was totally engrossed in this video.  My grandfather was the head groundskeeper at Sick's Seattle Stadium from 1938 to 1960, and I literally sat at his knee listening to his stories of Fred Hutchinson, Dick Gyselman, JoJo White, Bill Lawrence and others when I was a kid.  This video truly brought the Rainiers to life for me...I even saw Grandpa Joe twice!  I can't recommend this effort highly enough.  Even people with only a cursory interest in baseball should enjoy it.  And pay attention to comments from Edo Vanni, who is to Seattle baseball what Buck O'Neill is to the old Negro Leagues.",972691200,4,633,4.718181818181818
