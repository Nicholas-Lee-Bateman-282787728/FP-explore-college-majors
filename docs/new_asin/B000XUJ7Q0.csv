8229795,3,B000XUJ7Q0,"I'm not a big fan of the group - and actually have only heard a few songs by them. Personally I prefer the audio versions of the songs on the album to seeing the group move around the stage.  That said, this is about the fifth title in the ""Under Review"" series I've covered and, though I was hesitant at first, since the packaging make it look like one of those ""unauthorized biography"" DVDs flooding the market, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of the journalists who give their opinions on EACH TRACK on an album. It's nice that at least some video footage is included for those who are not familiar with the track. (Quality of the ""music video"" footage varies greatly depending on the source - usually European TV since these UR DVDs are originally UK produced.)

Viewers will ALWAYS disagree with the opinions presented since the producers found journalists with opposing opinions. But points are will made.

No, this is not a MUST HAVE for every music fan but those who own the album on CD (or vinyl!) will definitely find worth taking the 75 minutes or so to watch.

save your money for REAL AC/DC, not people who THINK they know about AC/DC, but have never been close enough to the band to smell one of Angus' farts on stage.",1198368000,10,808,4.38
