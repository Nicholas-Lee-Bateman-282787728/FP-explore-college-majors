I'm an extremely uncoordinated person, so at first although liked the music, I was haveing a hard time getting the moves down, but after a week or two I picked it up and now I can't stop doing it!! I find myself not even thinking about the moves, she says do this and I do!",1354752000,,321,3.953846153846154
8281358,4,B001B1P7QE,"I love the high energy of Chalene.  Cardio Mix 3 is my new favorite video workout, and Fat Blaster follows close behind. I think the intensity of these videos is great because I can take the ramped-up movements that I observe in the cast and translate them into high-energy modifications for my other Cardio Party Mixes (1 and 2).  I also like the shortened strength workout of 3T, which is great when I am in the mood for Turbo Sculpt but can't spend that extra 10 minutes that it takes.",1252713600,,488,4.411111111111111
8281359,4,B001B1P7QE,I have a bunch of other Turbojam DVDs and this pack of 3 adds nicely to the variety of workouts. Really like the Cardio Remix DVD best out of the 3.,1240358400,,148,3.806451612903226
8281360,4,B001B1P7QE,"I ordered this set after doing the whole Turbo Jam Maximum Results set. I like this one very much too! There are 3 workouts here--a 50-min cardio (Cardio Party 3), a sculpting workout with tube, and a 30-minute interval training workout (Fat Blaster). If you like the other TJ Cardio Party routines, there's no reason to not like this one as well. It's very similar, but if you're like me and need to constantly rotate routines to avoid boredom, then you'll appreciate this one. I like the Fat Blaster too--and to me, the 30 minutes really flies by. Fat Blaster is basically 4 of the ""Turbo"" segments (the one-to-two minute high speed parts in each cardio workout). You do a ""turbo"" at regular pace, then at Turbo pace. This is done 4 times, and before you know it, it's over, your heart is pumping well and you've burned some serious calories. My least favorite is the tube workout. I personally find working out with the tube to be awkward, but to each his own. I will do this tube routine occasionally, but for my serious sculpting, I will stick with the ""Turbo Sculpt"" workout from the Maximum Results set. Overall, this is a decent set and if you like Turbo Jam, it's a great addition to your workout collection. I've completely changed my body with Turbo Jam and though it takes me a while to master a new routine, ultimately I end up enjoying the Turbo Jam workouts very much.",1240012800,,1383,4.536
8281361,5,B001B1P7QE,"This set is as great as maximum results! I've lost 20 lbs. using TJ programs and you get cardio, sculpting and everything with this set also! It's worth it! The only strange thing is Cardio Party 2 seems to drag for me a bit, but it is still a great workout! I won't bore you with details of each video, but these work. It's as simple as that. My favorites in this set are Cardio Party 3, 3T and Lower body jam. The others are good also, but I just LOVE those 3.

Sometimes Chalene's cueing is a bit off kilter in some of the cardio party videos, but you'll get it after a few times.",1234569600,2,583,4.025862068965517
