5508118,5,B00ASUXBIA,Great explanation for children about the Sacrament of Reconciliation! I've used this twice in my 2nd grade Catechism classes and the children love it!,1448841600,,150,5.291666666666667
5508119,5,B00ASUXBIA,This DVD is a must see for any of your kids in Sacrament Preparation.  We use this in our parish as a fun way to reach the kids as well as the parents.  It is a beautiful example of God;s love and conveys reconciliation as something not to be feared but to look forward to.  In our era of t his worls it is a breath of fresh air to see something done so well.  We have used this in the classroom and at home and the First Penance retreat.,1447804800,,438,3.8333333333333335

5508121,5,B00ASUXBIA,Excellent teaching video for young ones.,1433376000,,40,5.833333333333333
5508122,5,B00ASUXBIA,"We LOVE the Brother Francis series, there are 9 DVDs altogether, and we have bought each one of them for our children as a fun and creative way to pass along the Catholic Faith. These programs are fantastic, in that they have songs and stories to help children understand in an age-appropriate way each aspect of the Faith. We generally try to watch one or two in a weekend before we go to Mass in order to allow our children time to think about what they watched with us, and we remind them too.

These are fantastic, I HIGHLY recommend to everyone!",1431302400,,550,4.392156862745098
5508123,5,B00ASUXBIA,I love this video!!  The content is great.  The teaching of the Sacrament of Reconciliation is excellent.  I have shown it to a first grade class and a sixth grade class.  Both classes enjoyed the video.  Great to view anytime but especially during Lent.,1426636800,,254,4.681818181818182
5508124,5,B00ASUXBIA,"these dvd's are incredible....the children in Catechism love them and they are learning while having fun.  I hope they put more dvd's, I have bought them all",1426118400,,157,4.814814814814815
5508125,5,B00ASUXBIA,So cute and my kids keep asking to watch  Brother Francis movies over and over again!,1423785600,,85,4.3125
5508126,5,B00ASUXBIA,"Great video for children to learn more and understand better the Sacrament of Reconciliation.  Some differences in the movie and how my daughter was taught (behind the screen vs. face to face, different Act of Contrition) provided excellent discussion points.  She was quick to tell me all about how they learned.",1416787200,,313,5.117647058823529
5508127,5,B00ASUXBIA,"My boys are 19mos and 7mos and they both enjoy Brother Francis. Our favorite is ""Let's Pray"" but we were overplaying it and got this one. It's good too. The music is catchy and non-annoying and I find myself playing the songs in my head and actually growing from them! I can't wait to move through all of the DVD's. We're getting them one at a time because our 19mo old likes to stick with one thing for quite a while. When we got our first Brother Francis DVD, I found that he was more aware and behaved better in Mass. It's adorable watching him try to apply what he learns such as crossing himself during the Pray DVD.",1368748800,,621,4.226890756302521
8557423,5,B00ASUXBIA,"This is a great video, my first graders love the series and this one was perfect with our lessons.",1530835200,,98,4.2105263157894735
8557424,4,B00ASUXBIA,"My kids love Br Francis movies. Maybe they'd be less keen if they watched more cartoons, but I'm happy to give in and let them watch these occasionally. ;-)
This video has one inaccuracy: Br Francis says that after confession, the soul is a clean and sinless as ""the day you were born"". Perhaps they were really referencing ""the day you were born again in Baptism"", but I did have to talk with the kids about original sin to avoid confusion.
Otherwise, awesome video for understanding and preparing for this sacrament. I love how these movies pack so much content into an exciting, catchy show. It covers sin, forgiveness, and the mechanics of the Sacrament. There's nothing like overhearing your 3 year old singing ""I've got a loving Father. He is always ready, always ready to forgive. He knows that I am weak and his help is what I need. His love is always, always here.""",1525219200,,874,4.608974358974359
8557425,5,B00ASUXBIA,Great! Well done! will use this with my program!,1504483200,,48,4.444444444444445
8557426,5,B00ASUXBIA,All the Brother Francis videos are favorites of the children at our church. This Forgiveness episode is also good for parents who need a refresher. It contains vivid examples of sin children can relate to. Highly recommend!,1487030400,,223,5.054054054054054
8557427,5,B00ASUXBIA,...Excellent...Strongly recommend...,1471219200,,36,17.5
8557428,5,B00ASUXBIA,"So excellent. I can't reccomend Brother Francis DVDs more. They are entertaining, informative, solidly Catholic.  I use them with my 2nd graders but I think younger and older kids would also enjoy.",1470441600,,197,5.15625
8557429,5,B00ASUXBIA,This is a child friendly video that even adults can enjoy and understand.,1464134400,,73,4.6923076923076925
8557430,5,B00ASUXBIA,100% recommended. This has been my kid's favorite so far!,1462147200,,57,4.8
8557431,5,B00ASUXBIA,Great movie for kids and it explains a lot. I used this movie for my second grade class making their first reconciliation.,1458518400,,122,4.590909090909091
8557432,5,B00ASUXBIA,"Love Brother Francis series.  My grandkids, ages 3 and 5, love them too.  I was a bit concerned that they would be a little water down on the theology, but it's not.  Very Orthodox and appealing to the young kids.  They are entertained and are learning their beautiful faith.",1450828800,,275,4.551020408163265
