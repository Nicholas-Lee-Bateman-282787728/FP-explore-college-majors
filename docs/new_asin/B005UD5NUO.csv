8546873,5,B005UD5NUO,"It is an excellent teaching tool for the children on the autism spectrum, just like other Bumblebee DVDs.  Clear presentation of the concepts, music and songs that help with learning, and using of white background when a key concept is presented to help the kids focus rather than being distracted by the irrelevant scenes.  Highly recommended.",1360800000,,344,5.125
