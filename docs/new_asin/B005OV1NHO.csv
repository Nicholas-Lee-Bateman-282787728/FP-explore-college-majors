8482114,5,B005OV1NHO,"The fil on this DVD, Between Gods and Demons, is primarily an appreciation of London, and, while interesting, would not demand repeated viewings.  However the DVD contains more than 90 minutes of previously unreleased archive footage from opera, lieder, and musical theater.  These are what earns this DVD 4 stars.  The 14+  minute excerpt from act 2 of Tosca with Maria Callas, and Mitropoulos conducting the Metropolitan Orchestra is, alone worth the price of the DVD.  Yet there is also 18 minutes from Boris Godunov and the Songs and Dances of Death among much other. Unfortunately there is an absence of subtitles in this section.",1328745600,10,635,5.0095238095238095
