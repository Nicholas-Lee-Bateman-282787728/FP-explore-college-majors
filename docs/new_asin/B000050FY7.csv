7928898,5,B000050FY7,Watched the series twice when it was televised with English sub-titles and loved every minute of it.  Can't someone be persuaded to re-issue the series so a whole new generation of non-French speakers can enjoy it?  In the meantime I'll just keep re-reading the brilliant novels by Maurice Druon.,1438473600,,296,5.020408163265306
7928899,5,B000050FY7,Awesome TV series even if it looks like filmed theater. Very faithful to the original books and with excellent actors. I hope they will sell it soon with English subtitles.,1414108800,,172,4.766666666666667
7928900,4,B000050FY7,"There are been two French TV series derived from the Accursed Kings, a six volume series first published in French between 1955 and 1960 (a seventh volume was added a decade latter). Both are good, although they also have drawbacks. At least one of these is common to both productions. This one is the oldest. It is often also felt to be the best of the two and it was first presented in 1972.
I will begin with the limitations of this series, before detailed the more numerous and considerable qualities of this series.

The main limitation, and for perhaps most non-French speakers, the main flaw of this series is that it is not dubbed and has no subtitles, not even in French. Contrary to another reviewers assertions, this has nothing to do with any form of Gallic arrogance. The explanation is a much simpler one. This production was never intended to be exported. It was done for French TV, at a time when all French TV channels were part of the public sector (State-owned, in other words). There was therefore just about zero incentive to have the series translated in any other language.

It is also for the same reasons that the series is somewhat old fashioned, with the story being partly told by a narrator. You get the impression that it is a bit of mix between a historical series, a historical documentary and a theatre play. In fact, many of the actors
This is a pity because both the topic covered by the series, and many of the actors performing in it are quite remarkable and would certainly deserve a wider audience. The topic is a little known period of French history  the reigns of Philippe IV the Fair, of his three sons and of the first Valois Kings under which the Hundred Years War against the Kingdom of England begun.

From the mid thirteenth to the mid fourteenth century, the Kingdom of France became the most powerful in Europe. Compared to the Kingdom of England in the 1330s, on the eve of the Hundred Years War, it was about three times richer and three times more populated. It is this power and how it was largely wasted as France lurched from one crisis to another that is retraced in the six books and episodes of the Accursed Kings series.

The story starts in 1314, the last year of the reign of the implacable Iron King, Philippe IV the Fair (or Philippe le Bel), and the year where he had the last Great Master of the Templars burned burnt at the stake and was cursed by him, together with his descendants. From then on, it is mostly downhill all the way, with Robert III of Artois and his aunt Mahaut playing a key role in the turmoil as both stop at nothing to gain advantage over the other in their two decades long quarrel.

Perhaps the most outstanding feature of this series is the actors. Some are better than others, although none are less than good. Two of the main actors  Jean Piat and Helene Duc, playing respectively the roles of the two key characters Robert III of Artois and his aunt Mahaut  are very well chosen and reflect the characters described in the book in a rather outstanding way. They are (and were) larger than life, physically, through their presence onscreen, and through they totally unscrupulous, murderous and very cunning minds. Also remarkable, even if perhaps less outstanding, are the actors playing the roles of Philippe le Bel (Georges Marchal) and his daughter Isabelle (Genevieve Casile), the she-wolf of France, Queen of England and the unhappy wife of Edward II. She was the one who most closely resembled her father and had his brains, although his second son Philippe, who would become King under the name of Philippe the Fifth, came in a close second.

Finally, and just like the books, the series are superbly documented and there is very little in the story that is made up. All of the main events are either entirely accurate or are interpreted in plausible ways, some of which were already voiced shortly after the events happened. In particular, the poisoning of various members of the extended French royal family, and why and how these events took place, does indeed remind of some of the deeds that George R.R. Martin has picked up for his Game of Thrones, even if these are also mixed up with features drawn from the War of the Roses.

Three last comments to finish this review, which has been made by a previous reviewer, and which I can only agree with. One is that each episode follows very closely the book, including the dialogues. Another is that it is therefore possible, despite the absence of subtitles, to follow the various episodes even if your understanding of French is school level (to paraphrase this previous reviewer). However, it does require you to read all six books beforehand. It also, to be fair, requires a sustained effort and quite a bit of concentration. I believe it is certainty worth it, but the investment is a very significant one and may put off some.

Four stars, which would have easily been five if only they had been at least some subtitles.",1412812800,,4978,4.619909502262443
7928901,4,B000050FY7,"This French television production of Maurice Druon's famous hexalogy has a great deal to recommend it: most pleasurably, for those accustomed (or resigned) to the megalomaniac meddlings of Hollywood, it is EXTREMELY faithful to the original books, right down to the dialogue.  It is also, by and large, well executed; although the gentleman playing the central character, Robert d'Artois, has a tendency to overact (possibly because of M. Druon's repeated characterisations of him as larger than life).

Unfortunately, it has two large strikes against it.

One, mentioned by other reviewers, is that there are no subtitles.  One has to wonder at the cause: indifference to foreign sales, arrogance (let them learn French), or simply laziness?

The other is that the entire thing is apparently shot in cheesy studio sets.  Even quite modest settings like council chambers are unconvincing.  I didn't expect a cast of thousands, but they can't even manage the forest scene where Philip the Fair collapses.

Even more irritating than the visuals, though, are the acoustics, which never change, whatever the scene.  Even when it's supposedly the streets of Paris, there are no background noises, nothing but the dialogue of the principals.

Can it have been done on a shoe-string budget?  A major production of a famous book by an Academician (as the titles do not neglect to tell us)?  Surely not.  Some comments on Amazon France attribute these characteristics to the age of the production (1972), but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth-R/dp/B00005LC1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth R</a>, from the same era, is far more professional.

However, this is comparing it with the very best.  By and large, the fine acting and the colourful characters and costumes make it more than worthwhile &mdash; if you speak French! &mdash; to catch this convoluted, fascinatingly true historic pageant of power, violence, love, hate, intelligence, stupidity, treachery, nobility, venality, and (of course) sex.

Incidentally, there are six (not seven) volumes of ""The Accursed Kings"" books in English, corresponding to the six episodes of the video:

UPDATE

I now gather that sets and costumes were deliberately kept minimal, to give the audience the feel of a small theatre production; fair enough (although I would have thought that a small theatre used cheap sets because it had too, not because it wanted to).

Also that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2005-remake/dp/B000I13K8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2005 remake</a>&nbsp;has realistic sets, CGI blood and guts, and (with the illustrious exception of Grard Depardieu) inferior acting (but still no English subtitles!).

7928903,4,B000050FY7,Certainly one has to say that the action is fast and furious. And historically it is good. The costumes are great.

7928905,5,B000050FY7,"This is a fantastic series. It  has got the lot, a great sexual scandal with three french Princesse's caught  with their lovers, their imprisonment, the strangling of one and an immense amount of treachery, intriugue, bad faith and goodness in one series. It all happened too. The author Maurice Druon researched it and  if he says he happened , it did. This adds to the enjoyment. I saw it with subtitles on British Television in 1974 . This was before video and once it was gone, you never saw it again. I had very vivid memories of it. The actors, all from the French Theatre are magnificent.  However only buy this series if you either speak French or have read the 6 original books. As it was rereleased in , I think 2005 but without either dubbing or subtitles. l have read the books and I can understand what is happening.",1297382400,4,829,4.470198675496689
