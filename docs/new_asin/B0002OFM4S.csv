2111375,5,B0002OFM4S,"I can recommend this  DVD for anyone who enjoys a gentle, relaxing session, without very difficult, advanced poses.

The pace and simplicity  of Diane's instructions, along with her calm voice and the lovely background scenes make it ideal for beginning and intermediate students.",1092355200,5,280,5.465116279069767
2111376,5,B0002OFM4S,"I have done Yoga for many years, tried various types including Hatha, Iyengar, and Kripalu.  I have also watched quite a few videos on different aspects of Yoga.

While touring Cape Cod I picked up a copy of this video at the Hyannis Barnes and Noble, and am very glad I did.  The instructor lead me through a gentle, complete Yoga class on the beach.  The pace, her voice, and the sequence of poses are all excellent.  Sitting and standing poses are included.  This is a video that I can do in its entirety, and feel more relaxed and centered at the end of the day.

This is not a glossy, big studio video featuring instructors doing poses I can't hope to do: this is a great, down to earth, beautifully shot video I can follow time and again.",1090540800,6,744,4.309352517985611
8029995,3,B0002OFM4S,"I was hoping for a gentle all-over yoga session to follow along. All in all this is much more like Pilates and with some dance or gymnastics warm-ups than it is like any yoga I have ever done.

It is about 15 minutes of primarily upper body stretching, followed by half an hour of strenuous core and hip strengthening exercises, followed by 15 more minutes of core-focused standing & stretching poses none of which work the legs. I get the impression she thinks she has legs covered, because there are lots of varieties awkward leg-lifts. In actuality, those primarily work the hips and, back and stomach.

It is pleasant and the instructions are very clear and straightforward and timing is excellent, so I feel I really can't give it less than three stars. Also, I am watching it on a computer DVD player, and it DOES enable me to to select whichever one of 10 sections that I would like, so it is not hard to find the place you want to look to see a particular pose, if you write down some notes on the sections.

8029996,5,B0002OFM4S,I found this Hatha Yoga workout to be restorative.  It relaxes all tension from the body and mind.  It relieves stress & anxiety.  The sequence of postures is relaxing and an invigorating moving meditation.  This is a balanced Hatha Yoga practice.  The scenery is a beautiful natural Cape Cod beach setting.  The instructor's voice is serene.  She also has a background in stress reduction.  Making this a perfect workout for people with high stress lives.,1152835200,4,456,4.986666666666666
8029997,5,B0002OFM4S,"Diane does a great job rejuvenating my mind, body, and soul.  The narrative is very well executed as well as the actual yoga positions.  The process and positions are in a naturally ascending order and easy to follow.  This yoga DVD gives me a great workout yet it is very relaxing.  I enjoy the soothing water as a backdrop, and the therapeutic background music fills the space nicely.  Great quality videography and I highly recommend this DVD.",1128729600,4,446,4.740259740259741
8029998,3,B0002OFM4S,This workout is approx. 1 hour long.  It is unusual because you start out seated and do poses like seated forward bend right away before you progress to a few standing poses at the end.  The pace is slow and relaxing.,1126137600,7,217,4.2682926829268295
8029999,4,B0002OFM4S,"I love almost everything about this dvd... the lovely setting (on the beach)... the background music (Japanese flute). Diane gives very clear detailed instructions that I could follow the practice without looking at the screen. The practice is mixed between easy relaxation and invigorating poses that challenge your core...just right.

The only con is that there is no chapter but overall the dvd  is so good that I could ignore that issue. However, I think it's worth mentioning.",1104624000,13,481,5.153846153846154
8030000,5,B0002OFM4S,"As a yoga practitioner I have watched over a hundred yoga DVDs and own over fifty. This is one of the best I have seen, the postures are accurate, beautifully executed, and accurately explained. The instructor is very clear in her descriptions and instruction, also she is very lovely. The setting (a Cape Cod Beach) couldn't be a more serine place to practice yoga. The photography is excellent and that exquisitely played flute and wind chime music is perfect for a calming focused mood. Good Work Dianne.",1093305600,12,507,4.839080459770115
8030001,5,B0002OFM4S,"I have tried many yoga videos and always felt as if they were either too advanced or just plan boring. But, Cape Cod Yoga is just right.

Diane Kovanda has the ability to communicate in a soothing, natural manner and the poses she presents are a perfect blend of ease and just enough of a challenge.

Using the beach as a backdrop created a relaxing, Cape Cod feeling.

Thanks Diane!",1092787200,12,383,4.442857142857143
