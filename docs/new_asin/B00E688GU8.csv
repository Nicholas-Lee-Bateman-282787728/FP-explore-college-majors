5891976,5,B00E688GU8,My kids for some reason really like Anime but they could not stop laughing for over 10 mins when they watch this show,1390089600,3,117,4.130434782608695
5891977,4,B00E688GU8,"Fun show with an ending you can see coming, hero has his hands full with several girls after him, including a half sister. On top of that there is a company trying to start a scandal involving him.",1389830400,,197,4.2105263157894735
5891978,5,B00E688GU8,I was hooked from the moment i started watchingit from the beginning. I loved the story mode. I wouldn't hesitate to watch the second part if there is one.,1388448000,4,155,4.379310344827586
5891979,4,B00E688GU8,"Shougo is the heir apparent to a large business conglomerate and only child to the president.  However on the day of the funeral, a lady's voice comes through the window telling him that she is his little sister and wishes to marry him.  One year later he transfers to his new school with the understanding that he need to find a nice girl and marry her before he graduates (good thing he is a second year).  And he is surrounded by a lot of lovely ladies, until a mysterious caller calls and lets him know that his little sister is at the exact same school.  Now he must not only be careful on who he falls in love with, but also narrow down his search and find the sister he never knew he had.

Despite what the other reviewer says, this is not a rip of Onegai Twins (one of my favorite series)(though Episode 3 did have that feel, but it was a lot more entertaining than Twins Episode 3 was).  You have a slew of potential suitors/sisters from the cute girl next door, to the rich blonde, to the mysterious store owner - each one with their own unique personalities and character story that just draws you in as you watch Shougo go through to find true love, but hopefully not with the sister he also wishes to be united with.  You will enjoy this series if you enjoy a good story with a mystery and the chance for happiness for all involved.",1382400000,19,1345,4.271653543307087
5891980,2,B00E688GU8,"First off, this is pretty much a ripoff of Please Twins without Johnny Yong Bosch and Kari Walhgren kickin' @$$.  I can honestly say that this has so few redeeming qualities, you would have more fun studying physics.  At any rate, watch it and come to your own conclusion; however, for my two cents, there are much (MUCH...Steins:Gate, Beck, Gundam, Sword Art Online, etc...) better series out there to enjoy.

Frankly, I do not usually review stuff I rate as low as this, preferring to provide opinion on series I find exceptional, but because this one was such a blatant copy, I couldn't keep quiet.",1382227200,7,601,4.704761904761905
5891981,5,B00E688GU8,Nakaimo was a fun and sexy series I had seen it on TV before a and enjoyed it then. It kept me waiting for the next episode to find out how the story would progress.,1432684800,,165,3.742857142857143

5891984,5,B00E688GU8,this was a great anime a good solid story but not too cherry so you know it was a bit on the sad side for those who like fanserivce you got it here lots of t and a sobe aware! i licked all of the charters and it was defentley a belivbe story i would recommend it,1411171200,,262,3.6140350877192984
5891985,3,B00E688GU8,"This series contains some nudity/fan service and is not suitable for children.

An average series, nothing mind blowing in concept or execution.  The animation was pretty good, the girls were cute, and the Japanese voice acting was good.  The plot line was an interesting twist to the typical harem themed comedy.  The mystery of course is which girl is the biological little half-sister.  Each episode seems to eliminate a potential candidate... until what you think you know is thrown out the window at the end and the actual sister is identified.

I slowly lost enthusiasm from episode to episode.  The humor is OK, nothing new.  Each character has a decent background story and you become interested in their lives.. but the series seemed to stretch on.  While the ""question"" of whose who is answered, there isn't a resolution at the end of the series.  This would prompt a season 2.. but I'm not sure it was interesting enough for me to buy it when/if it becomes available.

No real negatives, almost 4 stars, but it the story just lacked the depth to get there.",1402012800,6,1067,4.744565217391305
5891986,4,B00E688GU8,i enjoyed this only wish it could have ended differently other then that really funny and entertaining anime id rate it a 8.5 outta ten on the count of the ending but everything else amazing,1393545600,,190,4.457142857142857
5891987,5,B00E688GU8,"It's so funny at times, but it also really gives you the feels! T.T Emotional rollercoaster the whole time. Very happy that I bought it and watched the whole thing in a single sit sitting! Worth a watch for sure.",1393459200,,212,4.325
5891988,4,B00E688GU8,"I thought this was a very cute anime and definitely worth purchasing, the only thing I didn't like was the outcome of the story, which I'm sure this view would very person to person, so try it and see what you think.",1393286400,,216,4.166666666666667
5891989,3,B00E688GU8,"Not my favorite anime. It's not terrible, but I would look elsewhere for harem anime if I was just starting to collect the genera. Sekerai or Freezing are both good options though both have girls beating the clothes off each other.

Nakaimo has innuendo and much nudity. If those things offend you then stay away.",1392508800,,313,4.6909090909090905

guy goes to a school to find a wife but one of them might be his little sister, so he has to try and find his sister, so he doesn't end up falling in love with her

The story is interesting and there is some mild nudity  i liked it enough to buy it, but i always recommend watching it before purchase",1390953600,,336,3.985074626865672
8601815,5,B00E688GU8,Great series can't wait until next DVD,1514505600,,38,4.571428571428571
8601816,5,B00E688GU8,Great show and even better than the anime show MM!!! I always get jealous of a man getting hit on by so many beautiful women (never happened in my reality at least)! The only show that can top it by a small margin is Cat Planet Cuties because it also had gun fights and way more action but the overall comedy and fan service is wonderful in this show whereas MM just showed way to much physical abuse to the main character (not really my thing)!,1492646400,,445,4.186046511627907

8601819,5,B00E688GU8,"I really like this show, I saw it before a few years ago but the English dub was not out yet. It has a genuinely interesting story that i refused to let myself spoil. I watched until the end and enjoyed it. It has a little bit of everything, including boobs and panties, drama and comedy.  The characters are very likable and so is the art and the music.",1481673600,,354,4.130434782608695
