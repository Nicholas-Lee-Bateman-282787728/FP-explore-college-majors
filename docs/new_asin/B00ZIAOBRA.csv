8720329,2,B00ZIAOBRA,"Does not contain the entire series. It is missing one entire episode (The Motivational Speaker), and it appears the other six have scenes cut (as they are not as long as they are listed online). I don't have Hulu, so bought this. Very disappointed that it is not complete. As for the series, it gets better the longer it goes. No way reflective of actual res hall staff, but it's not supposed to be!",1520294400,,399,4.405405405405405
8720330,3,B00ZIAOBRA,"This DVD is missing content. Many plotlines and episodes have been dropped from its Hulu Exclusive Episodes. I don't understand why this is. But this DVD does contain, I'd say 65% of the show. And I like that 65%.",1518134400,,213,4.487179487179487
8720331,5,B00ZIAOBRA,"The humor is crude, the acting is OUTSTANDING, and this is overall an exceptionally executed series. This is a series I will pop in whenever I need a solid laugh. I've watched and re-watched this series a number of times since buying it. It really bums me out there has not been a season 2 yet, because the show truly found itself.",1490400000,,331,4.354838709677419
8720332,3,B00ZIAOBRA,I guess my expectations were a little high on this one before viewing. I was a little disappointed it was not better than it turned out to be.,1445558400,,142,4.107142857142857
