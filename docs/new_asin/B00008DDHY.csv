1834784,5,B00008DDHY,"Bloody Sunday is a well filmed show that brings to light of one of the most tragic events in Irish history. On a peaceful cival rights march, the British first opened fire on the Irish march, and were given permission to fire at will. Any one who is Irish, and knows exactly what happened on that faitful day, can now get an up close and real feel of what it was like to face the British para's, while peacfully marching for equal rights, in a land whose boundries were gerrymandered by the British. The movie is very acurate, showing that the British first shot on the defensless Irish. Years later the British government investigated the events of that day, called the Stalker Report. Once the investigation was finished, the British refused to release the results of that investigation. This movie, is not one sided. It accurately portrays the events of that day, showing that the Irish were repressed of their due rights, by an invading, colonial government.",1055289600,8,962,4.766467065868263
1834785,5,B00008DDHY,"One of the outstanding films of 2002!
The events of January 30, 1972 are familiar to most people primarily through the U2 song ""Sunday Bloody Sunday.""  On that fateful, tragic day, a peaceful march for civil rights in Northern Ireland ended in a horrifying massacre when British troops opened fire on the demonstrators.  Now, three extraordinary filmmakers - writer/director Paul Greengrass, cinematographer Ivan Strasburg, and editor Clare Douglas - have pooled their talents to give us their view of this watershed incident, one that so enraged Northern Irish Catholics that it ended up strengthening the hand of the IRA and heightening anti-British sentiment in that part of the world.
""Bloody Sunday"" is reminiscent of those great films from the 1960's like ""The Battle of Algiers"" and ""Z,"" wherein the filmmakers successfully recreate a moment of terrifying violence in purely cinematic terms.  By employing a handheld camera throughout, Greengrass achieves the kind of reality and immediacy that is only possible through cinema verite style.  The camera bobs and weaves, becoming a major character in the drama.  Indeed, the film feels very much like a documentary feature recorded at the actual event itself.  The filmmakers do an amazing job staging the complex action, managing to view the incident from widely varied vantage points - from the marchers in the crowd, to the policemen standing by for trouble (and fomenting most of it themselves), to the demonstration's organizers, to the troop leaders at command center where the decisions for action are ostensibly being made.  The crowd scenes are so well handled in this film that they could easily become a textbook case study for future filmmakers seeking to make movies in a similar vein.  Greengrass also heightens the verisimilitude of the work by resisting the temptation to employ a background musical score.  Instead, the ""soundtrack"" of the film is composed of the perpetually ringing telephones that subtly reflect the extraordinary import of the moment.
Because Greengrass' main concern is in getting the physical details of the incident right, less time is, understandably, devoted to character development.  Nevertheless, he still manages to bring a few of his key people to life, particularly Ivan Cooper, a member of Parliament who organized the march, a man whose guiding philosophy is that people must have the right to protest peacefully to achieve social justice.  Ivan serves as the focal point for the audience, as we come to identify with his commitment, his passion, his level-headedness and his genuine concern for the people he represents.  James Nesbitt does a beautiful job conveying the humanity of this Gandhi-like central figure.  Greengrass also allows us to see, in telling glimpses, the differing attitudes that prevail among the citizenry of the town as well as among the policemen - both those giving the orders and those executing them - towards what is happening on screen.  Indeed, there is nothing less than a superb performance in the entire cast.  (In an interesting moment of visual irony, the camera catches a glimpse of a movie marquee with the words ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" emblazoned on it - a reference to the famous John Schlesinger film from 1971).
Some people may have trouble with this film on two counts - one ideological and the other technical.  There are some who may see the movie as somewhat one-sided, biased and slanted, since clearly the British troops are seen as the Bad Guys in the incident.  More serious, perhaps, is the fact that the Irish accents are so thick that those of us unaccustomed and unattuned to them may find a significant portion of the dialogue garbled and incomprehensible.  That being the case, it is a blessing that the film's greatest virtues lie in its visuals.
""Bloody Sunday"" is an exciting, brilliantly executed tour de force that reminds us of just how powerful cinema verite can be.  This is, easily, one of the very best films of recent years.",1054425600,9,3997,5.102760736196319
1834786,5,B00008DDHY,"I can't believe there isn't more comment on this film, more outrage either way.  After having marched recently and heard accounts of  demonstrations from credible accounts (not corporate media), I believe demonstrations that turn violent often do because the police had been given carte blanche from leadership before the demonstration even starts.  Look at Oakland and the way the police showed up in full riot gear, gas masks, etc. and immediately began shooting all manner of 'non-lethal' bullets at protesters and dockworkers alike.  Jerry Brown gave directions to put fear into the crowd and anyone who might consider similar action.
As for this film and its content, I was quite impressed with the realistic portrayal.  I loved when one para corrected another para by calling them 'terrorists'.  They're in their home being shot on by an occupying army.  How relevant is that?  It was very easy for me to see oppressed people from around the world in the plight of the Irish.  It took the South Africans many, many bloody years to gain their freedom.  ""Was there a need to kill civilians?""",1052265600,2,1095,4.967032967032967
1834787,5,B00008DDHY,"""Bloody Sunday"" is a remarkable and powerful film; a rare breed of film that makes you wonder why such a gem goes so unrecognized by moviegoers.  This is such a well-done and important film that has the ability to re-create history with pure authenticity.  One of the best things I did last week was purchase this DVD.  As soon as I started it, I knew there was no turning back.
I had never heard of the event itself (here's my age showing again).  Never even learned about it in high school.  As a matter of fact, I'm learning there's LOTS of things I never learned in high school, but back to the movie.  ""Bloody Sunday"" is a documentary-like film that re-creates what transpired on Sunday, January 30th, 1972.  In a Civil Rights demonstration in Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire on protesters when things were getting hairy, which would eventually lead to 27 wounded and 13 dead.  This was a tragedy that struck a major blow to the Civil Rights movement, and to Ireland and Britain as well.
From what I understand, this is still a very controversial topic, even today.  Nobody is still 100% sure of what exactly happened.  Both sides are still debating and offering their versions of what really went down.  I don't know much about the event, as I said in the beginning of this review.  What I do know is that this film was done in a very realistic and authentic way, and I believe that what happened on that tragic day might've gone down the way it did in the film, or very close to it.  I also believe that the movie shows both sides, not just one.
This film was done entirely hand-held, meaning not once did the filmmakers use a dolly or camera stands.  The end result is that it gives it the raw and realistic feel that it needs to be affective.  There is no story or plot in the movie.  The movie isn't there to tell a single story or show us ""characters;"" the only goal is to try to educate us all on what happened on January 30th.  You never look at the actors as actors, but more like the real people themselves.  In fact, when I was watching this, I was very convinced that I wasn't watching a movie, but a real documentary.
The DVD comes equipped with some very nice special features.  Those being two commentary tracks and 2 documentary features.  That may not sound like a lot, but when you view or hear them, you feel very satisfied.  It would've been nice to have a few more extras, but I can't really complain.  Nor do I want to.
I really believe the filmmakers when they say that they did not make ""Bloody Sunday"" to open old wounds.  They want to educate us all on what happened and they want us to confront it.  Much like when an addict has a problem but he or she won't admit it, the problem will never come to a resolution if we continue to ignore it.  I urge every history teacher to make their students watch this movie.  I urge EVERYONE I know to give this movie a try.  It is a rare and unique gem that takes historical films to a new level that it has never reached before.  It's a shame that not many have seen it, but my hope is that more people will see it now since it is available to own and rent on DVD and video.  ""Bloody Sunday"" is an experience you will never forget, and it is an important one you do not want to miss out on.  Definitely makes my Top 10 of 2002 list, without question.",1051401600,66,3335,4.2896
1834788,5,B00008DDHY,"When I saw that a movie called ""Bloody Sunday"" was playing at a local theater, my first thought was, ""Oh, that's the U2 song."" I knew it referred to a Northern Ireland civil rights protest where shooting broke out, but the song was basically the extent of my knowledge of the event. Once I decided it would be an interesting movie to see, I tried to avoid reading anything about what happened, in an attempt to go into the film with an open mind, to be completely receptive to director Paul Greengrass's vision. I saw the movie, and left the theater shocked, saddened, enraged, and bewildered, but with the firm impression that I had seen a truly remarkable film.
The movie is shot documentary-style, with many quick cuts and fade-outs to black to end a scene. It took a while to get used to this modus operandi, which at times seemed choppy, disrupting the flow of the movie. But as you lose yourself in this film the style makes sense and seems less obtrusive.
The acting is superb, lead by James Nesbit as protest organizer Ivan Cooper. And while it is fairly certain where Greengrass believes the blame for the tragedy lies, the film at least makes an attempt to explain the scenario from the British military's point of view. But instead of merely looking to reveal ""who started it?"", what should be taken from this view of events is that tensions were so elevated on both sides, that it took comparatively very little action to set off large-scale and vicious reactions. Such is the madness of war, which is basically what unfolded on the streets of Derry that day...
Greengrass's camera leads you right into the middle of this battle, from start to finish. The results are visually and emotionally jarring; the you-are-there feeling is intense. And at the end, almost as a reward for making it through the film, you are treated to a live version of U2's famously haunting song.
It is a travesty that this film was not nominated for (and chosen as) Best Foreign Film at this year's Oscars- supposedly an airing on European TV made it ineligible. Hopefully it will be honored in some other manner. ""Bloody Sunday"" is far from an uplifting movie but is definitely an important one, and nothing less than a marvel of modern filmmaking.",1050537600,12,2238,4.668354430379747
1834789,5,B00008DDHY,"Rough, dark, and foreboding, ""Bloody Sunday"" is anything but standard movie fare. This movie deftly explores the massacre of January 30, 1972 using a documentary format, edited in a manner to make you feel like the events are unfolding in real-time. The documentary style lends the movie an authenticity which you rarely find in mainstream movies. This makes the effects of massacre feel incredibly visceral. The movie is hard to watch for this reason. It's downright grim at times and drags the viewer along through some of the aftermath - the grieving and anger that the event caused.
The scariest thing about this movie, however, is the fact that it is tough to draw the line at fact and fiction. I don't know what really happened on Bloody Sunday since this was really first exposure to it, but the movie demonizes very effectively the occupying forces. Movies like this are dangerous and exhilerating precisely because they have the ability to conflate the reality of the event with the drama of the film, but they also have the ability to be reckless in their representation of events. If things actually occurred the way that the movie depicts them, then the members of the occupying force should be ashamed of themselves. If the events of the movie inappropriately condemn that force for taking actions that they did not make, then the director should be ashamed. Watch at your own risk.",1048204800,7,1395,4.8655462184873945
1834790,5,B00008DDHY,"Familiar with the famous U2 song, ""Sunday Bloody Sunday""?? Well, here's a look at the events that inspired that song.
On January 30, 1972 Catholics living in the Northern Ireland's city of Derry march for human rights denied under British rule. But this wasn't an ordinary march by any means. Thirteen marchers were shot dead during what was later termed ""Bloody Sunday"".
This movie alternates between both sides of the firing line. Efforts of the march's organizers leading up to the march along with several young men who participated in the march are captured. In addition, the military readiness of the British soldiers is also revealed. This movie unveils savage acts of the British soldiers as they fire upon the defenseless crowd.
I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in this horrific day. It will make you think twice about the role of the military in Northern Ireland.",1035763200,39,891,4.946666666666666

1834892,5,B00008DDHY,"""Bloody Sunday"" creates almost unbearable tension as director Paul Greengrass recreates the tragic events of 30 January 1972 in Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland, when thirteen unarmed demonstrators were shot dead by soldiers of an elite British parachute regiment.  There have been a number of cinematic treatments of the Northern Ireland conflict -- Jim Sheridan's ""In the Name of the Father"" (1993) is probably the best-known -- but ""Bloody Sunday"" remains unique because of the restraint with which the story is told.  The events of Bloody Sunday are allowed to speak for themselves, increasing the dramatic impact of the film.

Paul Greengrass's directorial style seems to be a deliberate choice of minimalism.  I'm not sure whether to call it cinma vrit or something else.  In many ways, it reminds me of the Dogme 95 school of filmmaking, set forth back in the 1990's by a group of Danish directors led by Lars von Trier.  The Dogme directors committed to following a strict set of rules -- e.g., hand-held camera only, no music without a practical on-screen source such as a radio -- all of which were meant to make sure that what appeared on screen would feel more real, less stylized.  Greengrass seems to be following at least some of these rules, and his doing so gives the film a documentary-style realism.  The abrupt fades from one scene to the next leave the viewer feeling perpetually off balance.

(Special note to American viewers: The accents that one hears in the film -- not just Northern Irish accents, but also accents from different parts of England, Scotland, and Wales -- are rather strong.  When I showed this film for a class at Penn State, my students asked me to activate the subtitles so that they could understand better.)

James Nesbitt plays Ivan Cooper, the real-life Protestant politician who sought to build a multi-religious coalition of people who would march together for civil rights, and for an end to the endemic and systemic discrimination that the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland then faced.  American viewers who know Nesbitt only as the hapless but likable hog farmer Pig Finn in ""Waking Ned Devine"" (1998) will here see him playing a very different sort of character -- a confident, forceful, dynamic leader, optimistic that he and the people he is leading are on the right side of history.  When an IRA leader says, ""Marchin's not gonna solve this thing,"" Ivan's reply is a succinct, ""Watch us.""  Ivan and his supporters, following the example of the American Civil Rights movement, emphasize their commitment to non-violence, and sing ""We Shall Overcome"" as they make their way among the poverty-stricken flats of the Bogside; and their optimism is touching precisely because we know that, on this day at least, it is unjustified.

The factors that will contribute to the tragedy of Bloody Sunday are many.  A small group of lads, militantly opposed to the British presence in Northern Ireland, seem motivated at least as much by mischief as they are by politics.  The British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (1 Para), forever cooped up in their Saracen half-tracks as they roll through hostile nationalist neighborhoods, are tired of being taunted, and their supervisors assume that the march will be marked by violence and hooliganism.  The audience senses at once the inappropriateness of an elite offensive military unit being deployed in a domestic peacekeeping role.  British General Ford (played by Tim Pigott-Smith), calling for get-tough measures against the Catholics (whom he doesn't mind telling jokes about), is portrayed as a personification of aristocratic hauteur; his immediate subordinate, Brigadier Patrick MacLellan (played by Nicholas Farrell), has official tactical command of the British response to the march, and wants to handle the banned march with ""minimum force,"" but seems to have no real power as long as Ford is around.  The practical, experience-based perspectives of the city's Chief Superintendent Lagan (played by Gerard McSorley) are blithely ignored by the arrogant Ford.

The film's pale, desaturated color scheme adds to its air of realism, as angry young nationalists break away from the main parade, and 1 Para soldiers, anxious to kick some arse, start shooting.  The image of a march steward's corpse, draped in a bloodsoaked ""Derry Civil Rights Association"" banner, speaks volumes.  As Lagan angrily asks MacLellan, ""You call *that* minimum force?""

Yet the film does not end with the shootings.  It is striking to see Private Lomas, the one conscience-stricken member of the 1 Para unit that fired upon the protesters, trying to decide whether to tell the truth as the members of a military board of inquiry ask, ""Were all the rounds fired in accordance with the yellow card?""  General Ford washes his hands of the affair, placing a stricken-looking MacLellan in charge of the inquiry while stressing that ""My role on the day was purely as an observer.""  We hear a heartbroken Ivan Cooper say to the British government, ""You've destroyed the Civil Rights Movement.  And you've given the IRA the biggest victory it will ever have.""  In the darkened hallway of an apartment building, we see IRA gunmen handing weapons to new recruits, and we know that what is still called ""the bloody watershed"" in Northern Ireland, one of the worst periods of the civil conflict there, is about to unfold.

Greengrass's minimalist style perfectly complements this heartbreaking story, and the DVD contains one particularly haunting extra -- an interview between actor James Nesbitt, who played Ivan Cooper, and the real-life Ivan Cooper, conducted in the part of Derry where the Bloody Sunday shootings occurred.  The contrast between the peaceful, post-Good Friday Accord city of today and the urban battleground of 1972 is striking.

Much has changed since 1972, and even since this film's release in 2002.  In contrast to the 1972 Widgery Report that largely exonerated the British Army, the Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, concluded that British troops had ""lost control"" and fired on unarmed demonstrators, and British Prime Minister David Cameron offered an official apology on behalf of the British Government.  While there is still plenty of tension in Northern Ireland, especially during the summertime ""marching season,"" the peace established by the Good Friday Accords has, in the main, held.  ""Bloody Sunday"" reminds us of a past that Northern Ireland will hopefully never return to, and draws a singularly powerful picture of the ways in which, in any politically volatile society, tragic events can take on their own momentum.",1410048000,6,6650,5.148698884758364

1834936,4,B00008DDHY,"""Bloody Sunday"" is a film based on the civil rights protest massacre in Derry, Ireland on the 30th of January 1972.

The movie presents a unique cinematic experience by shifting back-and-forth the events of the day from the perspective of the Irish protesters and the British troops.

The close quartered cinematography takes the viewer to each scene as a participant to the events, and the filming style also includes a slight haze to some scenes with a lack of artificial light, which provides a closer connection to the time and day through a rawer presentation.

As the protagonist Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt) carries much of the narrative with the story continually returning to him after other characters are explored, and also following scenes independent of him.

The authenticity of acting by the entire cast gains continuous momentum through the emotions and experiences of such a tragic day.

The rawness of the movie provides the viewer with no comforts, which causes a tremendous feeling of shock and loss due to the sheer injustice carried out on the day. This film though also remembers those people killed or injured and its very creation allows viewers from all over the world to never forget these people.

1834938,5,B00008DDHY,"Having grown up during the Viet Nam War, the daily papers usually contained body counts on the front page. One gets desensitized to this and the numbers tend to remain numbers. This film drives home the fact that there are names attached to those numbers, and those names have families.

Here's the scoop. It's January 30th, 1972. Irish Parliament member Ivan Cooper is organizing a huge peace rally to get the Brits out of Northern Ireland. The Brit military is on hand in large numbers. Things start out well enough but a small faction of the Irish protesters confront the British troops with harsh language and rocks. They're met by live ammunition leaving 13 dead and 14 wounded.

Anyone knowing director Paul Greengrass's work in the Bourne films can pretty much forget about those while watching this. The slick sheen of the Bourne films is replaced by the immediacy of the cinema verite style here. Greengrass puts the viewer in the middle of everything. Natural lighting, hand held camera and natural settings all add up to give the viewer the feeling of immediacy. These don't feel like actors, they are real people. The rocks are real. The bullets are real. And when you see family members crying over their dead the result will rip your heart out. Greengrass clearly sides with the Irish. He doesn't absolve them of guilt by any means. Some broke off from the whole and antagonized the British troops.

In ""Bloody Sunday"" Director Greengrass is  recounting an horrific event.  All is done in hand held letting us be right next to the charactor.

1834941,4,B00008DDHY,"It's 1972 and group of Catholics from Derry, Northern Island are planning a peaceful demonstration on the lines of Martin Luther King's peaceful civil rights marches in the 1960's. This march will help bring attention to the plight of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.  The British Army is prepared to stop and derail the march in any way possible. The result is the bloody Sunday massacre.
BLOODY SUNDAY is a hard movie to watch. Emotions run high knowing this is a story based on an actual tragedy that will always be in the hearts of Northern Irish Catholics.
Director Paul Greengrass  does a remarkable job of making the film seem like an actual live newscast of events. We see the planning of the march from the Irish side and the plans by the British soldiers to stop the demonstration. Although it's clear that Greengrass is tilted toward the Northern Irish viewpoint, it is hard to fault him. Whatever the exact causes of the massacre, there is no doubt that innocent people were killed that day.

The march is set to be peaceful but as always, a few hooligans hoping to stir up trouble and incite the British are in the group. The British soldiers are determined to stop the march and some are actually looking for revenge over the death of some fellow soldiers.

BLOODY SUNDAY is a ""You are there as it happens"" film. This makes the film all the more realistic and unnerving. This is not a fictionalized story created in someone's mind. The camera work is jittery just as if someone were following around participants as things happen. There is no transition because the  film goes back and forth from the Northern Irish to the British and various members of both sides. It's like a few cameras are in place and we are cutting back and forth from one side to the other. IThe film is jarring in its realism and it is painful to watch knowing what is going to happen.

The Catholics want to speak up for their civil rights in their own land. The British soldiers, for the most part, are presented as all bad and desperate for revenge. A couple soldiers seem to have a conscience and a heart but they are forced to follow the majority. In some cases, soldiers are ""executing"" wounded demonstrators. It is a brutally realistic film made all the more disturbing  knowing the massacre actually occured.

James Nesbitt is a fine Irish actor who appears in many British shows and films. He stars as the Northern Irish member of Parliament organizing this peaceful protest that all ends in tragedy.
BLOODY SUNDAY makes the viewer wonder how all of this could have happened in the modern era. I, myself, want to find out more about this sad bit of history. What are the exact facts? Were any of the British soldiers sympathetic to the Northern Irish Catholics? What happened to the surviving participants and soldiers. Why did it go so terribly wrong?

If you are not familiar with what lead to this place in history, first research the appalling conditions that Catholic Nationalist were forced to live under, then you will understand.  In the sixties and early seventies Catholic Nationalist (a minority in the North) were treated much the same as how Black Americans were treated in the South in the 1950's.

Derry, North Ireland, January 30th 1972. Ivan Cooper is the leader of the movement in favor of the civil rights, against all of those who are in jail without the supposed judicial process. IRA affirms there will not be violent acts. The Major General Ford warns the journalists these manifestations are illegal, while the Brigadier Patrick Mack Leilan, chief of the English forces, coordinates his troops with the aid of a vital support from Belfast to trace the departed Irishmen. Gerry Donaghy is a catholic teenager who has been set free and tries to dissuade her mother and girlfriend telling them the march will be just a peaceful ride and so, there's no reason to worry about it.

1834966,5,B00008DDHY,"For many years, 'Bloody Sunday' was to me simply a vague notion, an empty slogan repeated (or so I thought) to rationalise or justify any atrocity, now matter how abhorrent. A little knowledge is indeed a dangerous thing, particularly concerning an event that took place when I was only nine years of age. It was not until I had seen this film, masterfully directed in a chilling documentary style by Paul Greengrass, that I fully comprehended how significant Bloody Sunday actually was - and indeed continues to be - to Irish national identity, Indeed, there can be very little doubt or argument that this single event managed to set back the Irish peace process for at least three decades. In the meantime, both the innocent and guilty alike were pointlessly maimed and killed, and the utter futility of a relentless spiral of violence and retaliation renders any distinction between the culpability of the victims completely irrelevant.

Centrally, this film is about the abuse of power, the unjustifiable and indefensible use of deadly force, and the lengths to which a government will go in stifling peaceful and legitimate dissent and manipulating public opinion to achieve its ends. In this manner, the British Government actually became what it claimed to despise and in so doing undermined the very values that made any society worth protecting in the first place. To the thoughtful and politically aware, these lessons have an unnerving relevance to the events of today.

My initial reaction was that the film had a clear anti-British bias - further reading has, however, revealed that if anything, Mr Greengrass had deliberately (though understandably) soft-pedalled this important aspect presumably to avoid alienating a significant proportion of his potential audience. Had he revealed further factual details - and his portrayal of the British Paras is quite appalling enough as it stands - then I believe have would comprehensively undermined his position. Powerful understatement is the key to the film's devastating effectiveness.

I had previously been led to believe, if only through my conventional British upbringing, that the Irish conflict was simply an endless and brutal game of atrocity and retaliation (the former, of course, invariably committed by foaming-at-the-mouth Republican baby-murderers), effectively becoming a demented game of ""he hit me first"". If there's one thing this film encouraged me to do - and if this was Mr Greengrass's aim, he succeeded admirably - is to investigate the facts on my own with an open mind, as free of emotion and bias as I could muster, reject previous prejudices instilled in me by well-meaning though misguided parents, and form conclusions of my own.

The facts are these: the British Para Regiment's expectations of the violence they would encounter that day, presumably drummed into their heads by their politically-motivated superiors, became a self-fulfilling prophesy. Free speech and independent thought are hardly encouraged in a military hierarchy, and in this sense the Paras became victims as well, at the hands of their own government. They became willing victims in a sense, determined to even the score for the deaths of their comrades they had witnessed in previous encounters with the Provos, and were keenly encouraged in this pursuit by their superiors who should have known better but did not.

Victims they may have been, but not nearly to the same extent as the dead who were left with no voice. They were either peaceful demonstrators - who were legally petitioning Her Majesty's Government for basic human rights such as freedom of speech and an end to detention without trial - or were simply innocent bystanders. A loose analogy may be drawn with Bloody Sunday and the US Army Reserve's actions at Kent State, Ohio in 1970 - the differences being not only that the body count in Londonderry was much higher, but public opinion was manipulated in the latter case - after a sham inquiry and the medals having been handed out - to victimise the dead a second time and in the process exonerate the guilty.

James Nesbitt's understated performance is masterful, as is Tim Pigott-Smith's as his mirror-image 'toff' British Army commander. The balance between the quiet and dignified outrage of the former and the bloody-minded stupidity of the latter is as heart-rending in the first case as it is infuriatingly convincing in the second. While I will not pretend that this is a pleasant evening's viewing, I will state with full conviction that is a necessity due to its powerful, compelling and honest depiction of the truth - too long obscured by a patina of deliberate bias, public relations spin, a government's appalling abuse of power and its malicious, politically-motivated mendacity.",1289347200,3,4780,5.153350515463917
1834967,1,B00008DDHY,"""Bloody Sunday"" is a politicized misrepresentation of the infamous shooting of Catholic demonstrators by the British Army in Northern Ireland 30.01.72. It is made by Paul Greengrass and IRA sympathizer Don Mullan.

The film is shot in a real-time documentary style manipulating viewers into believing they are watching real events when in fact they are watching a politically-motivated film made largely by IRA sympathizers.

The film manipulates the viewer in a pro-Irish , anti-British direction. For example actors who usually play good guys (Jimmy Nesbitt) are cast as the Irish whilst actors who play pompous figures (Tim piggot smith) are cast as the British. NICRA (Civil Rights Movement) is misrepresented as non-violent when in reality it used violent confrontation as a tactic.

The portrayal of this event as a massacre of defenseless peace-loving pacifists is totally false. The Bogside of Derry was an IRA-controlled war zone which was perilous for the Army to operate in.  The soldiers were attacked with acid bombs and by pre-arranged snipers (though the Saville inquiry believes the British fired first). None of this is shown in the film.

There are long and graphic scenes of Civilians being shot and killed as well as scenes of people crying loudly over dead victims. At the film's conclusion the names and ages of the dead are read out. This is very much a film appealing to emotion rather than reason.

The film-makers have decided to focus on one exceptional event in thirty years of violence in which it was the security forces who killed scores of civilians in a context in which 90% of troubles victims were killed by paramilitaries.

There is a scene in which nail bombs are planted on a victim. No evidence exists to support this, in fact the film dishonestly hides from the viewer the said individual's membership of an IRA youth organisation.

Two senior officers involved with organizing the operation were decorated by the queen for their long service in the British Army on two separate occasions shortly after this incident. ""The officers who planned and led the operation were later decorated by the queen"" reads a hate-mongering subtitle  at the end, a willful and malicious distortion of the facts.

Bloody Sunday is a politically-motivated distortion of real events in order to scapegoat the British for IRA violence. We are told that no reforms were introduced by the British and that they destroyed the Civil Rights Movement and will ""reap a whirlwind"".

In fact there had been years of reform since 1968, with all demands being introduced by 1975 (with NICRA disbanding voluntarily in 1981 ). Sadly most reviewers are unaware that they have been misled by a slick piece of IRA propaganda!",1284422400,3,2728,5.04

1834973,5,B00008DDHY,"Paul Greengrass, who brought us the powerful and controversial ""United 93,"" made a stunning film about the events that transpired on January 30, 1972 in Londonderry. Greengrass presents the film in a documentary fashion, giving the impression that you are observing the events as they take place. On that day, the Civil Rights Movement, led by MP Ivan Cooper, were determined to march in spite of an official ban on all such gatherings. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought against many abuses of power on the part of the Northern Ireland administration, but the core issue was the abolition of Operation Demetrius, or internment. Basically, British soldiers could arrest and intern those suspected of being paramilitary groups without charge or trial.

Cooper, who came from a rural Protestant background, wanted only a peaceful march. He urged IRA members not to bring weapons to the march, and advised youth who were harassed by soldiers to ""just walk away."" Unfortunately, due to high-levels of IRA/British soldier clashes, the ""Paras"" (1st Battalion of the British Parachute Regiment) were out in force. In addition, despite Cooper's pleas to the contrary, armed ""Provos"" (members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army) were present. It's still not clear how it began, but shots were fired, and the Paras killed 14 unarmed marchers and wounded several others. The film clearly implies that the British shot first, though that's something that may never be determined with certainty.

Shortly after the events of Bloody Sunday, the British government convened an inquiry known as the Widgery Inquiry. It absolved all the British soldiers of responsibility. In response to political pressure, Tony Blair launched the Saville Inquiry, which as of now has yet to release a report.

In the final part of the film, with Ivan Cooper and other Civil Rights leaders speaking at a press conference after the events, Cooper says: ""I'd like to say to the British government- you know what you've done, don't you? You've destroyed the Civil Rights Movement. Tonight, young men will be lining up to join the IRA, and you will reap a whirlwind."" His words proved to be prophetic. Had Bloody Sunday not happened, it's likely that the Civil Rights Movement could have achieved what the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements are now achieving.

The acting and direction in this movie are top-noptch. Even though the viewer knows what's going to happen, one feels a certain amount of suspense. The interment issue has an eerily contemporary ring to it, and this film shows the dangers of a militarized police force. The two featurettes on the DVD are quite informative as well.

Having done riot control on several occasions I can tell you that the military scenes are absolutely realistic.  The movie does very well portraying the chos and uncertainty of this type of operation.

The massacre scenes went on for too long. The actual shooting that day didn't last more than a few minutes.  The number of soldiers that were present could have inflicted 26 casualties on a crowd like that in a matter of seconds.

Its so easy to lose control in chaos like that.  Leaders really have to keep an eye on their people to keep them from getting trigger happy.

Having said that - the marchers don't get much sympathy from me.  ""Let's go throw rocks at the Army.... that'l show em."" or ""There's a riot 200 meters away from us but we'll just stand here and listen to our less than bright parade leader because we know that riot can't effect us....""

What can we add to the plain fact of 13 people killed in cold blood by the paratroopers of Her Majesty the Queen of England without any clzear order to do so ? There is no excuse for this event, absolutely no excuse. The march should not have been banned and blocked in the first place. That was a total misunderstanding of the situation. And the English had never had anything to do in Ireland in the first place. The film though is not as effective as it could have been because the editing choice is pretty simple, not to say bizarre. Why try to produce a sloppy, amateurish and old TV documentary when everyone knows it is done on purpose by professionals in 2001 and with only filmed professional actors. It makes the film very chaotic and unsmooth. The only thing that is clear is that the demonstrators were pretty amateurish in their non-violent disorganized organization whereas the paratroopers were pretty good professionals at obeying an order that never existed and the army was very good at covering up the event. And we have to keep in mind it will take more than 25 years to finally start moving towards a political settlement. And it is still fragile and could erupt again any time even if the situation is improving steadily day after day. We are still far from the end. Keep in mind that 13 dead people in Londonderry is probably more than in Tien An Men if we take into account the respective populations of Northern Ireland and China, and even one casualty would have been too many. As far as I know there was no casualty when Martin Luther King marched in Washington DC, and we can be absolutely sure that Martin Luther King's Baptist dream was just as valuable as that of these Northern Irish Catholic citizens, and vice versa of course.

1835028,5,B00008DDHY,"Bloody Sunday is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of the last 20 years.  There are a lot of films that touch on some aspect or events of ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, but Bloody Sunday is, far and away, the best of them all.

The acting is superb.  James Nesbitt, as Ivan Cooper, the protestant MP and civil rights activist, gives an Oscar-caliber performance.  Regrettably, films like this get almost no attention from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences or other similar groups.  The cast around him all perform impeccably.

Movies of this kind tend to romanticize or glorify the fallen. The writers and producers of this movie honored the dead without making them martyrs or without a sort of too-sweet sentimentality.  The suffering of the victims' families is real and raw, their losses very palpable and human.

What makes the emotional impact so tremendous is the realism of the cinemetagrophy and dialog.  The attacks by British Paratroopers on the civil rights marchers feel real, terrifying.  Many of shots were made with hand-held cameras, so the viewer feels as if he/she is right in the middle of the event.  There is not a silly, superfluous, corny or overly-dramatic bit of dialog in the film.  The screams, the cries, the conversations, the speeches, etc., all are what you would expect to hear in or around an event like this.

Critics might argue that the film is not balanced, that it portrays the British military in a bad light.  It's true that the British Paras are clearly the ""bad guys,"" but over 30 years of information-gathering about this dreadful event has strongly tended to show that the soldiers were primarily to blame for ""Bloody Sunday.""  If you have issues with the objectivity of the film, perhaps those concerns should be addressed to the scores of historical (eyewitness, expert reconstruction) accounts on which the movie is based.

Nothing entertaining or light-hearted or uplifting is to be found in Bloody Sunday.  It's dark, sad, even angering.  But you'll not find too many other films as gripping and meaningful as this.",1146441600,4,2094,4.934285714285714

The above reviews in which people compare the IRA to Al Queda are obviously from people with little knowledge on the situation in Northern Ireland. It was not a march of victory nor was it for freedom from the UK; it was for civil rights so that Catholics may receive the same treatment as Protestants in a Protestant majority state. The previous review on how this film hindered rather than helped the peace process was made from a person who I feel is highly uneducated on the situation. This film shows a real account on what happened on this tragic day and it shows it fairly from both accounts. The acting was raw and very real as a lot of the actors in the shooting scenes were people who were there that day and the emotions they show was very real. In making this film both soldiers and civilians who were present on that fateful day were interviewed. The fact that it was shown as a documentary style film was to deliver as an accurate and believable film as possible and I think it succeeded immensely in doing so. If only more films were made as carefully as this one we might get to the truth on a lot more issues governments choose to sweep under their political carpet. And with regards to previous reviewers please don't make remarks on political issues you obviously no so little about.,1115856000,6,1371,4.488
1835034,5,B00008DDHY,"From the moment the opening credits begin (with a haunting and brooding score punctuated by nervous military radio banter) to the sombre closing credits (with a fine live version of u2 performing Sunday, Bloody Sunday) this picture, dramatising the unfortunate events of 30 January 1972, in Londonderry, N. Ireland grips you and--slowly, surely--winds the tension up like a spring.

Whilst I will avoid recounting the events of that terrible day (the previous reviews do that very well) and will avoid commenting on its historical accurateness (there's certain to be inaccuracies cited in this telling by historians, and, truth be told, the British do not represent well at all here [seeming so hateful and criminal as to be, at times, difficult to believe--but, maybe that's the point) I will say that the film feels amazingly real-that is, it is utterly convincing. Through a documentary styled presentation showcasing amazing and sharp acting performances, you are drawn in completely-you believe you are there.

Technically, this DVD is beautiful. The picture is presented in a gorgeous anamorphic 16x9 transfer with solid blacks and crisp and tight (if intentionally muted) colours. The audio is likewise full and punchy. You will notice that there are two feature audio track options: 1. A `Domestic' audio track (which is, in fact, a U.S. mix (domestic would mean the U.K., the film's place of origin), and 2. A U.K. release mix. The difference between the two is that the U.K. track has a much more spacious and pronounced ambient/surround mix, whereas the `domestic' mix reduces much of the ambience in favour of a louder (centred) dialogue track (most likely to aid the N. American audiences not conversant with the Irish accents and varying dialects featured so prominently in the film.)

I cannot recommend this film too highly. It is a fine example of what art can aspire to when embedded with a strong and passionate message.",1110240000,10,1939,5.110410094637224

FREE IRELAND!many other once english ruled places are free now like china and india.theyve made thier point.give it up already! and lastly,the only real difference between a fool and a hero is wether or not you were sucessful.no one is going to remember the irish king wanna be as ca hero for leading his lambs to slaughter.",1097539200,3,1437,5.307017543859649
1835036,3,B00008DDHY,"I understand that the producers wanted this mockumentary to be as close to ""the real tying"" as possible but they might also have kept in mind that the film, as dialogue-rich as it is, loses a great deal for viewers who are not well-versed in Northern Irish dialect.  I had to watch it twice all the way through before I really grasped everything required to appreciate it.  If this had been made solely for domestic consumption in Ireland the question would not be relevant.  However, marketed as it has been for overseas consumption, one must ask at least why there were no subtitles provided.

I also question the motives of the filmmakers in putting together a feature film that ""fools"" the viewer into thinking it's a documentary.  Kudos to the brilliant acting jobs by known and unknown actors alike and laud the choppy camerawork, which was right on the money.  But what was the point, really?  Why all this effort expended to make a feature that resembles a doc but isn't?  And the insertion of Tim Piggot-Smith (of ""Jewel in the Crown"" infamy) as the hard-ass commander is heavy-handed since this actor is routinely cast as sadistic military types and has probably never played a sympathetic role in his life.

I personally would rather see a balanced documentary of the actual event, so that I can know for certain that what I'm seeing truly happened.",1094515200,9,1360,4.753191489361702
1835037,5,B00008DDHY,"I am 1/2 Irish, 1/2 British, by heritage, I am a history major and international relations minor, I have written many papers on Anglo-Irish relations for both subjects.  It was the U2 song that got me intrested in the subjects.  I have learned alot about my heritage, and the more I learn, the more I am ashamed of the 1/8 of me that is English (the other 3/8 are Welsh).  I have read about the day from many different people; uninvolved 3rd party historians, Gerry Adams (who was not there), and both Irish and British authors, but seeing it, and knowing that it was a joint froduction of both the Itish and British film boards made me see a light, a comming together to heal old wounds.  This move made me realise that while the English were evil monstars on that day (and on others) the IRA retailated in June of 1972 killing 9 UDA men and 2 soilders, I am a Nationalist, I want to see the North annexed back to the Republic where it belongs, but it can not be done through killing.
As for the movie, it is not for everyone, if you want to learn more about the day or the Troubles in general it is a good way to start.
I have read so much about the conflict that many of the disturbing and heartrenching facts have become common place in my head, but this film made me cry, and still does everytime I watch it.  If you have any interest in the situation and want to learn more, I STRONGLY suggest you watch the film.",1087171200,14,1419,4.22140221402214
1835038,3,B00008DDHY,"""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" was a John Lennon song from his ""Some Time In New York City"" set that introduced me to this sad day.  ""When Stormont bans out marches,"" was the chorus that rattled in my head for the early 70s.  Then the U2 song came out.  Now I'm pleased to see this film.
It's hard to review this film without either reviewing the event itself and the political situation that surrounds it or reviewing the cinema verite style that director Paul Greengrass employs.  There is no doubt that ""Bloody Sunday"" is powerful.  I sat watching the credits roll afterwards and listened to the U2 song even after the screen went black.  I found this film less effective that the docu-drama ""Veronica Guerin.""  Gerald McSorely played Irish Mafioso John Gilligan in ""VG""; and here plays Capt. Supt. Lagan who sits dumbfounded hearing the news, patently ignored by the British officers.
The film is centered around Ivan Cooper played by James Nesbitt.  He does an excellent job as a wheeler dealer politician who then becomes dumbfounded at the day's results.  Tim Piggott-Smith does a marvelous job as the boneheaded Gen. Robert Ford who goads the British into the confrontation and then crows about it as a tremendous success.
The short abrupt cuts didn't work as well for me.  If they had started with longer sequences and progressively been snipped to shorter and shorter shots as we approach the massacre, the film would have had more of a sense of build.  As it is, it does convey the sense of confusion with people talking at once, not listening to each other, and then the screen cutting to a completely different setting and sequence, leaving each part dropped but adding to a cumulative effect.
Because this film is about an extremely important event, one that is unfortunately mirrored in too many unjust situations around the world, it does have a universality and resonance.  On the other hand, because we don't spend long enough with each character, because we don't come to know the 13 killed or the 14 wounded, there is a facelessness to the proceeding.  It would have been more moving for me if like ""Veronica Guerin"" we become directly involved with the characters and concerned with their outcome.  Even so, it's a film that deserves to be seen.  Enjoy!",1085011200,7,2266,4.804123711340206
1835039,5,B00008DDHY,"January 30, 1972 went down as one of the most horrific days in Irish history. A march scheduled in Derry, Northern Ireland to protest the British policy of internment, a policy used to lock up Irish ""troublemakers"" without benefit of a trial. An organization called the Derry Civil Rights Movement, a peaceful group dedicated to using non-violent tactics to effect change and supported by MP Ian Cooper, planned to march through the city in order to make their objections to the British policy well known. The British, racked by incessant troubles in Northern Ireland for years, steadfastly demanded that the march not take place. To punctuate their position, the Brits brought in the ""Paras,"" or the British First Parachute Regiment, to break up the peace march. Throw in the usual conflict between Irish Catholics marching through a predominantly Irish Protestant neighborhood, and you can guess what happened next. The Brits panicked and opened fire on unarmed civilians, killing thirteen people and wounding many more. Immediately after the debacle, the British government went into cover-up mode. Known forever after as Bloody Sunday, the events of January 1972 continue to divide the British, Irish Catholics, and Irish Protestants.
Two British filmmakers decided to examine the events leading up to the scurrilous massacre in Derry in this 2002 docudrama aptly titled ""Bloody Sunday."" Surprisingly, depending on what view you take concerning the mess that is Northern Ireland, the filmmakers fully support the theory that the British bear most of the responsibility for the massacre. According to the film, the British ""high command"" made it clear to the rank and file that there would be no march through Derry that day. An environment of inflexibility from the top down virtually guaranteed repressive violence, and so there was. Watching the film recreate the events of January 30th is a gut wrenching experience, especially as the marchers near the barricades in the Catholic Bogside neighborhood. When the Paras finally open up on the crowd, they aren't shooting rubber bullets. Protestors are executed after falling to the ground, fired upon while attempting to retrieve wounded comrades, and shot in the back as they run from the British killers. The Army claimed Irish Republican Army militants mingled with the crowd and fired first, thus provoking an appropriate response from the Paras. Yeah, right. This claim became the basis for the findings of several British inquiries into the massacre, a claim that completely ignored or marginalized the fact that the Derry Civil Rights Movement was a peaceful organization merely protesting an illegal government policy.
To help construct the lengthy narrative required to put the event into context, the filmmakers focus their attentions on Irish MP Ian Cooper (James Nesbitt) and a young Irish man recently released from jail who ultimately takes part in the march with disastrous consequences. Most of the attention goes to Nesbitt's Cooper, a man stridently fighting for the right to peacefully protest the internment policy. His character roams the streets of Derry, handing out flyers about the march, attempting to keep the protest going in the face of concerns about British actions, and working hard to keep the IRA out of the picture. Simultaneously, we see the British soldiers planning their response to the protest. There's a crusty general with a no nonsense attitude about any organized activity in Northern Ireland (he simply won't have it whether it's the IRA or non-violent protestors), and his underlings who express a bit more concern about the proceedings. Of particular note are the behind the scenes looks at the Paras, young men with a lot of bravado and a negative attitude about the Irish people. Yes, the film takes these young commandos to task, but it also shows how fear of the Irish marchers led directly to murder.
""Bloody Sunday"" is shot using hand held cameras and dramatic fade-outs and fade-ins to add a dimension of slowly unfolding tension to the actions of the characters, and it works. I felt sick to my stomach as I watched soldiers gunning down innocent civilians, felt deeply moved as Ian Cooper anguished over having to inform families about the deaths of their loved ones, and felt my Irish blood rise as the credits rolled to the tune of U2's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday."" There is a scene towards the end of the film where Cooper holds a press conference to discuss the massacre, and he grimly tells the assembled journalists that the British just gave the IRA its greatest victory. Sure enough, the Irish Republican Army gained hundreds of recruits after the killings, a fact hammered home in the film during a scene when young men line up to receive weapons from an IRA safehouse. I cannot say I blame these kids; I would have joined up too after such an egregious incident even though violence often causes more problems than solutions.
The DVD edition of ""Bloody Sunday"" comes with a lot of extras, including an interview with an elderly Ian Cooper about the events of January 1972, a trailer, interviews with Nesbitt and other cast members, a couple of commentaries, and a great looking widescreen transfer. We will never know for sure what exactly happened on that bloody day, but this movie goes a long way towards presenting a more balanced interpretation of events. If the British had only admitted to SOME wrongdoing in Derry, and there was British wrongdoing, many subsequent deaths may have been averted. Perhaps this film will help lead to relief of sorts for the beleaguered Irish still struggling under British influence. Whatever your view, ""Bloody Sunday"" is a gripping film well worth watching.",1077840000,3,5713,5.098185699039488
1835040,4,B00008DDHY,"A pretty good film.  My only complaints would be that you'd better turn the volume up because a lot dialogue (in critical scenes)is mumbled and carpeted with a thick accent.  I ended up sitting in front of the TV with my ears pressed against the speakers in some parts, however this may reflect listening to the Clancy Brothers and Prodigals too loud. This is an important movie, especially for those of Irish-American heritage.  It is simply a ""snapshot"" of a tragic day within an eon of conflict and hate.  The elder generation taught my generation never to forget the famine or the cruelty of the crown.  I, in turn, will teach my children never to forget Bloody Sunday as well.

1835041,5,B00008DDHY,"Many who watch this film may think that the IRA made it. The truth is that it is a British movie. If you do not know what Blood Sunday is then allow me to explain. On January 30th, 1972 - Catholic Irish demonstrators took to the streets of Derry in Northern Ireland for a peaceful march. On the lanes they where met by the British army who had set up barricades to keep them moving in a certain direction and away from the Protestant areas of the city. At one point some demonstrators broke away from the main group and began to attack a police barricade. Shots where heard and the army moved in with high velocity armed paratroopers turning the whole demonstration into a war zone. Innocent people where shot and killed. Some may even have been executed. The whole scene was like something out of a nightmare with British soldiers moving along the streets in uniform motion taking pot shots at what they believed to be armed IRA members. Whether or not armed IRA members where there the British army somehow managed to kill a lot of innocent people in the process and a cover-up followed to protect leading political figures - for example: How did some soliders fire more rounds than they where allocated? How did some innocent people who where shot dead end up with weapons in their pockets ""after"" the British army gathered them up? Who gave the order for the paratroopers to operate in the way that they did and why did groups of paratroopers go rogue and not respond to their chief in command?
Bloody Sunday plays out like Saving Private Ryan with Irish catholic civilians on the receiving end instead of Nazis. It is mostly one big ""action"" film that could also be compared to the likes of Black Hawk Down for its urban setting. All of the cast are functional and the film does grip you and at times is extremely violent and harrowing especially when innocent people are getting shot up. This is an urban nightmare of a war film. You should try to see it. It will certainly take you by surprise and is very well produced.
It is not a film that you will enjoy but you will be very glad that you watched it to know a little more about the historical conflict in Northern Ireland. This film depicts a very REAL event that happened and looks as real as it did then.
Excellent production.",1073347200,11,2289,4.478468899521531
1835042,5,B00008DDHY,"I loved the cinematography in this movie. It gives the effect of actually being there. Also unusual was the fact that there is no music or score to this movie except for the closing credits. The director of this movie was going to take a lot of heat no matter which point of view he took. I thought that the movie perhaps made assumptions regarding the British troops which were a little unfair, but at the end of the day the overall story of the movie is 100% accurate - British troops shot 26 civilians, killing 13, while suffering no casualties themselves.",1072224000,2,559,4.490196078431373
1835043,5,B00008DDHY,"An emotionally crushing recreation of the infamous January 30, 1972 clash between British troops and Irish protesters in the town of Derry, which led to the deaths of dozens of civilian marchers.  ""Clash"" is perhaps too strong a word -- this film (as well as several abortive inquiries) makes a strong case that the testosterone-amped British ""para"" soldiers simply went berserk and shot people at random, in hopes of ""teaching them a lesson they'd never forget.""  The distinction between IRA warmongers and the civilian civil rights movement was apparently lost of the embattled English, but their actions at Derry helped lock the Catholic-Protestant feud into place right up to the present day.  Filmically, this is an impressive work: the documentary-style handheld camera work, which seems a bit mannered and distracting in the first part of the film, pays off handsomely when the violence starts -- the fear and chaos of the event is made palpable in a suprisingly visceral manner... it's like a punch to the gut when the shooting starts.... and then it worsens and keeps on going for what seems like an eternity.  Regardless of what you think of the filmmaker's political slant, the skill with which they built this film's dramatic impact is undeniable.  Viewers will have to make up their own minds about what they believe actually happened that day, but this film proides a convincing argument on behalf of the civilian victims.

1835045,5,B00008DDHY,"Paul Greengrass has delivered the seminal cinematic essay on the origins of Ireland's troubled history. There are precious few heroes in the course of this film, and while many start out with noble intentions, the road to hell is quickly tarmacadamed.
This is a gripping film shot in cinema-verite style. My Viet Namese companion was uncertain whether the film was actually a real time documentary. The film aims to lay out what happened that created such a monumental disaster and it leaves you emotionally and horrifically exhausted. This is the dropping of the gauntlet and the levels of betrayal, prejudice, manipulation, ulterior motives undercut and destroy the human fabric. What was begun as a bi-partisan civil rights march ignited a six-county corner of the Irish island into a bonfire that still has not burned out. This was arson of the soul. In the murder of this day bitter enemies would find the justificatiion for more than 30 years of murder, mayhem, gun and drug-running, brutality, rape and desecration. Pandorra's box was opened, and all manner of evil was let loose in a society that could just have easily adopted a peaceful resolution. In the aftermath of the death and destruction of this day, modern terrorism from the IRA through the UVF to the PLO and Osama Bin Laden was born and found its legs to launch attack upon attack on the dignity of life. Governments learned to collude with gangsters. Noble human values were bought, sold , subjugated to one side's polemics or another.
To Greengrass's tremendous credit, he takes no sides. He allows the tragedy to unfold objectively. This film puts the lie to the Irish American sentimentality over the IRA and sets the stage for the rapacious and vicious assault suureptitiously promulgated by Margaret Thatcher. For the purposes of this film, this is the people on the street who by little decisions, squeezes of a trigger and bewilderment at the hell let loose, open floodgates to violence here to fore unimagined. This was the singular event that brought all the snakes back to Ireland, and Greengrass films them in an unblinking fashion. Perhaps no other film, save maybe HARRISON'S FLOWERS, so effectively captures just how horribly man is capable of betraying everything that is good about him. Had we not been thrown out of Eden before this horrible day, then we'd surely have been sent packing after this. Jim Nesbitt leads a remarkable cast. At no point do you ever have the sense that these are actors.
If you are sick to death of the green or orange sweater brigades who sloganize terror and murder, this is the film for you. If you are given to marching for one side or another, this film states quite clearly, God forgive you.",1057104000,,2713,4.874458874458875
1835046,3,B00008DDHY,"It seems that Catholic tragedies are the only events which warrant the attention of filmmakers. The IRA, INLA, Real IRA and Continuity IRA are responsible for bloody monday, tuedsay, wednesday, thursday , friday, bloody Brighton, bloody Enniskillen (11 civilians murdered), bloody Warrington (two little children, ages 12 and 3 murdered), bloody Warrenpoint (18 soldiers), bloody Omagh (29 civilians), bloody Guilford (5 civilians), bloody Birmingham (21 civilians), bloody City (3 civilians including a 15 year old girl),bloody Harrods (five civilians), bloody Claudy (8 civilians)... There isn't enough space for me to list all of them, but the list goes on.
  The stastics say it all: In the whole course of the conflict Republican groups have killed far more people (2153) than the security forces (365) and Loyalists (1080) put together. In addition they deliberately target civilians (example: Harrods 1983, Omagh 1998) and have even forced civilians to become suicide bombers for them (Patsy Gillespie, Londonderry 1990).
  This film is lacking, not for its portrail of the events of the day which is done quite well, but for what it omits. For example, the very same year (1972) was Bloody Friday (22 IRA bombs murder 9 civilians). No mention is made of any of these other events in the film. Nor, by the way, is there any mention of the fact that the Catholic alienation was due mainly to policies of the Unionist parliament in Stormont and not the British government.
