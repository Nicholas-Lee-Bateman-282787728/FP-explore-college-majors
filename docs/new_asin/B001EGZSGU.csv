8298039,5,B001EGZSGU,"This is a great kettlebell DVD.  I have had it for years.  I bought this one for my daughter, who lives in Montreal and uses my dvd when she visits me in NY.  It's a great workout - strength, cardio and flexibility all in one.  Anthony Diuglio is a very good instructor and it was from this dvd tape that I initially learned how to work out with kettlebells.  I have recommended this DVD many times over the past 10 years or so.",1508025600,,428,4.108433734939759

8298041,5,B001EGZSGU,"""Clinic"" is a 2-DVD set from Art of Strength.  The first is on kettlebell basics - swing, clean, press, Turkish get up, snatch, deadlift.  The second has 2 excellent workouts at 2 different levels.

The basics instruction includes basic movement as well as corrective exercises and troubleshooting information.  As Anthony Deluglio of Art of Strength is one of the leading proponents and trainers in the kettlebell, you're getting the best there is.

Given that kettlebell workout DVDs from Art of Strength typically run $49-69 by themselves, this is a good value, though at first blush it seems a little pricey.  If you already know the basics, don't buy this.  If you don't, this DVD set is an excellent way to get them.  You really should have some instruction to stay safe with kettlebells - this set provides it.",1232150400,3,817,4.869565217391305
