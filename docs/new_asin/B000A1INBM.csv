8072153,1,B000A1INBM,You get what you pay for - in most cases.  This is one of them.  Wonder if the actors got paid for their bad acting.,1395187200,,116,3.6
8072154,5,B000A1INBM,"The ol' vampire film genre is getting tired and definitely is in need of some new blood(don't have to write`pun intended', do I??)

These are chinese vampire films that are different from the Mr. Vampire types.

Ninja Vampire Busters is a great take on Ghostbusters with the wild wire effects and stunts we love from HK action films.

Only now it's with bloodsuckers.

Interesting mix of chinese black magic and rituals mixed with modern day vampire hunting.

Much more enjoyable than Van Helsing!!!

The other film is a real rare one.

It has a no name cast and is obviously low budget.

It reminds you of the cheap-o horror films of the 1960's.

I would say to get these just for the cover art alone but the low price makes this a sure sale.",1135641600,4,743,4.485074626865671
