3724658,2,B001NY43KA,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. The story line is
a young man gets taught the ways of love by an older woman. I think this
film fails on a lot of levels. The film trys to be arty with the dialogue
between the two leads but it is just boring. I have a hard time believing
anyone talks like that while having sex, in Argentina or any where else for
that matter. There is pretty much wall to wall nudity but the film is just
not very erotic. Antonella Costa is a beautiful woman and looks fantastic in
the buff but that can't make up for how boring the film is.",1289606400,5,581,3.9743589743589745
3724659,5,B001NY43KA,"This is a delicate film. It starts with the young male protagonist and subtly shifts to the female. She proceeds to educate him in the tantric and therefore, the spiritual side of love making. The erotic scenes are just that but from an entirely gentle perspective. There is an undertone concerning his relationship to his dead father. While, from one argument, appearance is a superficial concern, films are first and foremost, a visual experience. She is stunning. He is a suitable counterpart. The movie was a real pleasure to watch.",1287360000,32,536,4.966666666666667
3724660,4,B001NY43KA,"The story is basically about a sleepwalking guy whom accidentally fell into a woman's room and from there this woman he make friend with teaches him on different live erotic or sex making methods etc to more or less change his innocence and sleepwalking habbit. The live sex lesson that is given to this man is based on the idea of the book of Tao which means that they can pratice different sex position which ended up this woman's vaction ended and left him and he later got married and having children with another woman. This film is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVDfilm/movie. To couples, this film is a good buy afterall........

3724661,2,B001NY43KA,"If you're looking for something with a plot to masturbate to, this film is no good at all.  I had to skip around to all the 'good stuff' and it was just way too complicated.  This has nudity and stuff, but there's way too much of a story line if you just need something to relax your self with.",1278806400,21,294,3.9661016949152543
3724662,3,B001NY43KA,"I guess I'm just too old to enjoy this film.  While it was beautifully photographed I kind of felt I wasted time watching it.  I love foreign films but this one is mediocre.  Its not because of the sex.  Its because, (and I know I will get pelted for this but its my opinion) it really is just soft porn.

 The storyline was weak and the mysticism was an excuse to show naked young people.  I don't care if sex is in a movie as long as its relevant to the storyline and not overkill.  Would the audience appreciate the ""beautiful coming of age story"" if the stars were lumpy and out of shape?  (A young Jack Black...zoinks shiver me timbers!)

I'm sorry to disagree with everyone but I did give it a try.  I started watching it wanting to like it.  I wanted to identify with the character because as it was advertised I saw some parallels with my own life. (Lost my father not so long ago, met my second husband not long afterward in a way that could only be described as fateful) Yet in the end I felt let down.  The attempt to be deep was lost.

The only time I experienced true depth was at the end when Eloy's father appeared to him and told him life is about saying goodbye but don't let that stop you from living.  That to me was what the film was supposed to be about and yet it ventured off down the road of positions and thrusts.

In any case just my two cents worth, not trying to offend anyone.",1267488000,4,1405,4.129151291512915

3724718,5,B001NY43KA,"What I know about the film maker Eliseo Subiela is summed up, no, exhausted by the titles of two films, this one under review, and an earlier one, known in English as Man Facing Southeast. About that earlier film I have only superlatives. It stunned me the first time I saw it. It was so wonderful that I watched it a second time the next morning before returning it to the video rental. Presently, however, that film is only available in a Spanish-only release, in other words, no subtitles. I was heartened then to see this later film - with subtitles - available through Amazon. Don't Look Down is not on the same high level of imagination and execution as Man Facing Southeast. but I hasten to add, What other film is? That film was a blessed creation, and it confers grace upon those who and participate in it. It has the same sweetness and beauty and triumph that characterizes Elephant Man in David Lynch's collected films.
However, that said, I still rate Don't Look Down very highly. It is a Coming of Age story. The central character, an adolescent boy, is facing a double crisis in his life, which is the nexus of Death and Sex. His father has suddenly died which throws him into confusion, but happily he meets an older woman who initiates him into the pleasure and responsibility of sexual union. Note that second word - responsibility. This is not about casual sex, pleasure for pleasure's sake. It is about the role of sexual knowledge in
the growth of an individual to maturity, about its role in the development of his personality. The situation is clearly Freudian: there is a death wish and a life instinct. Which one will prevail? I am not giving away plot details in telling you it is the life instinct, literally embodied in sexual union, which triumphs. This film has a winningly positive tone throughout. The scenes of sexuality are suffused with tenderness, respect and good humor. I felt refreshed and restored each time I have watched it . . . Try to find a copy of Man Facing Southeast as well. It is the ne plus ultra among films!",1401753600,4,2059,4.582655826558265
3724719,3,B001NY43KA,It held my interest and kept on moving for the most part. It was in enjoyable to watch. There were a few slow parts in ;the movie or the rating would have higher.,1397001600,,162,3.9393939393939394
3724720,3,B001NY43KA,"This movie in a word is bizarre, and yes it has plenty of nudity, but I have to admit I was captivated by the weirdness of the storyline. I happen to enjoy fantasy sci-fi movies, so forgive me.  Talk about things that make you go 'huh?'  The acting is fine and the characters actually pull it off in this odd and offbeat film, but I can't recommend since it's not for most viewers.  Also, it was most frustrating that the film kept stopping after only a minute and this occurred throughout the whole viewing.  So if you do decide to rent and it does the same thing, complain to Amazon since it took me over 2 hours to watch a movie that is only a little over an hour.  Enough said....",1393977600,,684,4.190839694656488
3724721,3,B001NY43KA,"When his father dies, Eloy abandons the family masonry business to embark on a journey of growth and contemplation in a hostile world.

3724723,2,B001NY43KA,Another movie I never really got into. The best way I can summarize this is a boring sexual instructional movie for a young gent. The dialogue was minimal and boring.,1385424000,,166,4.566666666666666
3724744,4,B001NY43KA,Don't Look Down is quite an erotic and sensuous story of learning lovemaking by a young man from an experienced girl. The story line is simple but the comfort between the couple is endearing.,1376438400,,191,4.647058823529412
3724745,5,B001NY43KA,"Really a beautiful erotic sensation done with french class.
Its about the number 80 but most of us can thrust 500 or more.",1372982400,,122,4.3478260869565215
3724746,4,B001NY43KA,"Lots of nudity, but hardly inappropriate. A good, simple story; its gentle and held my interest. Yes, I watched it again, and would recommend it.",1364083200,,145,4.84
3724747,5,B001NY43KA,I like this movie. It reflects the life style in South America. The character was so brave to play in this movie.,1360713600,,113,4.181818181818182
3724748,2,B001NY43KA,This was an ok movie.  The characters really didn't have much chemistry to me.  You could tell that this wasn't a romance about two people who wanted a relationship.  The man seemed really immature.,1359158400,,198,4.764705882352941

3724750,5,B001NY43KA,"Being a student of tantra, I loved this film's story about beginning the path of tantra. It encourages us to dive into sexual  bliss, and to find a deeper understanding of ourselves.",1341705600,,182,4.6875
3724751,3,B001NY43KA,There are things to like about this movie. The basic plot idea perfectly OK- and the actors are good. But in fact this movie is more than a bit of a mess.  a lot of unneeded material was added in some sort of efort to make the story seem deeper in a sort of mystical sense- when in fact the added matter really just gets in the way.,1319328000,4,332,3.8823529411764706
3724752,4,B001NY43KA,"When I watch a movie of this genre I am looking for bare breasts and as expicit sex as I can get.  The main actress in this film is beautiful. And she has excitingly beautiful breasts. They are rather small but I prefer them small.  The film is ubiquitous with her nude scenes, much to my delight.  The film is punctuated with sensual nearly explicit sex scenes.  If you have to have explicit, go rent a copy of Caligula or the Brown Bunny.  Any of you reading this know of any other explicit films of this genre, please enlighten me.  The film has an odd storyline but is not boring and even interesting at times.  Oh yes there is a leading guy in this.  He walks around on stilts, thus the title don't look down.  For you guys with other proclivities, he shows his dork several times.  The movie is enjoyable, well acted and most importantly, has lots of nudity.
If you are ever thinking of buying a film of this sort, see if Amazon offers a trailer.  It might give you some idea if you'll like it.  If you are still not sure, you might be able to rent the film for a couple of bucks and watch it right on your computer screen.  Enjoy",1310774400,36,1136,4.203703703703703
3724753,5,B001NY43KA,"It is totally amazing to shadow the lives of ordinary humans, mystical beings--as we all have the capability to be--growing into full adulthood.  A film of two people who embrace one another completely within the wrappings of Eros, and the human spirit unfettered and whole.  A great educational film for those abhor nakedness, and, settle for the old one speed, in and out sex, tinged with anger or disconnection.  For stunted personalities, this is a film in need of a rating, or negative descriptive word. Either form of labeling, in toto, equals unclean and damaging to the morally innocent.  Hugo Arana has shown that the advocates of ""innocence"" desire a fate out of step with Creation and earthly sanity. Hats off to Hugo and the actors!",1297555200,3,744,4.880952380952381

I have the English subtitles version, but I also speak Spanish, and find that there are small, but significant differences, that make the movie even better by hearing/seeing both sides of the message.  The movie is quite touching, and much more important than Elvira's lovely body, and more profound than just the words and visuals, conveying 'lessons' about 'tantric techniques'.  Try it with that in mind, and you'll love it.",1457654400,,469,4.9113924050632916
