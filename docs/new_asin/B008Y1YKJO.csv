8532363,5,B008Y1YKJO,"very raw, very graphic ""GRIPPING""  kept me glued to the screen unfortunately it depicts the sad and true of whats going on with OUR people. men and women's lives lost and wasted cut short by foolishness! in either of these well made films all the members don't pursue school, work, church or anything that normal people do.  whose orders are they really following? YOU ALREADY KNOW.......STEAL, KILL AND DESTROY!!!!!",1410307200,2,416,5.0144927536231885

8532365,1,B008Y1YKJO,"A gang named Sex, Money , and Murder can't afford pants that fit right, chase after BBWs and keep saying they are going to axe people, but only shoot them. Hak comes home and Breeze, his preggo gf gets cut down in daylight by someone yelling ""Payback.""  Yeah, we feel ya man. The short list of people who would want to pay them back includes most of the Western Hemisphere as they decide to start a war with the Bloods to find Breeze's killer.

The film quality was poor. The sound was bad and changed noticeably with the camera angel. Camera angels were awkward as no one knew how to direct to eliminate awkward shadows and maximize lighting... you know the basics of photography 101. The acting was really sad as it plodded through a ridiculous script. Most killing was off screen.

Not worth watching.
