2658000,3,B000IJ7A74,"The trailer for this movie really got me pumped. But i was honestly dissapointed once the movie began. cheesey narrarator on a low budget.

Luckily, what saved this movie and made it worth buying..... was the fact that theres is alot of history in this documentary. He was able to gather pics and videos from when it all began in SF, all the way upto date. The special features was acually my favorite part. Lots of bombing.

Like i said, im not sure what i was expecting, but i was indeed expecting more out of the acual production of the film.

What makes this movie worth buying is the acual raw info.
if you care to know how SF came up, this movie is for you.",1202688000,6,663,4.246031746031746
2658001,5,B000IJ7A74,"Man this video is sick. I am from the midwest and went out to San Fran in the late 90's for a trip. I met a bunch of writers that are featured in this video so it was really nuts to see a bunch of pieces I have pictures of in the movie.

Anyway if you are into writing or have hooks into the Bay Area art scene then this movie is definitely for you.",1176076800,4,349,3.6533333333333333
2658002,4,B000IJ7A74,I don't know if we could go back to the days of the original Style Wars but this new era is way different from back then. I mean back then people made two or three dollars an hour if even. Also the televison would go off all day and may show one channel and one channel only. I guess this is why people rack for fun. But this is Piece By Piece. This movie has music in the background and has picture stills along with it. It's still illegal and why people do this is still controversial. The original cry was vandalism and still is.,1165536000,3,532,4.076190476190476
8145755,5,B000IJ7A74,"I got this as a birthday gift for my son, because he really liked the video which he saw on YouTube, and wanted to show it to a friend who is temporarily without internet access.  I was actually a little surprised to see it available on Amazon, and it made my day. Nothing better than getting someone a gift they will love.",1469577600,,323,4.209677419354839
8145756,5,B000IJ7A74,"My favorite documentary, ever since it was up on netflix back in the day. If you're a true bay area writer you already know this is a must have & if you havnt peeped this yet better hurry up & buy",1455062400,,196,3.8048780487804876

8145760,1,B000IJ7A74,"I really wanted to see the art in this film.  However the camera work is so bad in is not enjoyable on any level.  Too bad!  Interesting subject matter, completely ruined for the film.  Too much emphasis on being ""arty"" and jerking the camera around so much that the subject matter is blurred and beyond appreciating.  Amateurish with a capital A",1381363200,,346,4.60655737704918
8145761,4,B000IJ7A74,"I watched this movie when I was in college years ago and decided to check it out again.  Pretty cool stuff.  The film is definitely biased in favor of graffiti and focuses only on San Francisco.  It is kind of a shame most of the work is gone, but a stroll around the city always yields some new notable works and the all-to-prevalent tags which we all frown upon.  This is a great film to watch once or twice if you're ever curious or happen to be living in or visiting the city.",1354406400,2,480,4.129032258064516
8145762,5,B000IJ7A74,"I bought this when I was in highschool, and I am totally glad that I did. Many of the pieces seen in this movie are extinct today. I think Nick did a great job documenting the history of graffiti in San Francisco. It hasn't been done in the past, and I'm glad he was the guy to do it. I would never neglect or abandon this dvd, I will most definitely let my kids or grandkids inherit this just so they know and understand the good, the bad, and the ugly of San Francisco graffiti history!",1307491200,,488,4.09375
8145763,5,B000IJ7A74,"A must-see for any graffiti fan or writer. Unfortunately, it's out-of-print now, so in order to own it, you might end up paying more than it's actually worth. Too bad, because it comes with a supplementary booklet (about 40 pages) featuring interviews with writers featured in the film, photos, as well as director's and narrator's statements. The DVD alone is filled with about 2 hours of bonus painting footage and interviews, including a 30-minute slideshow set to music used in the film. It's also worth noting that it doesn't come in a half-baked, generic plastic case. It comes in considerably well-designed paper casing, covered in nicely stylized artwork featuring crew and artist tags. Unfortunately, given the price you might end up paying for it today, I could only suggest buying it to those who love buying things at outrageously high prices or those who can afford it.

I got the last used one that was under 20 dollars. I had seen the movie on Netflix a year back and it's what made me wanna be a writer. If you love this movie and find it going for a reasonable price, take it. Only if it comes with complete case and booklet, of course. Otherwise you're better off watching it on YouTube or getting it off Netflix. HAHA! No, seriously.",1265500800,3,1252,4.71689497716895
8145764,5,B000IJ7A74,My alternative high school art students love this one; a colorful documentary of the San Francisco street artists scene (includes foul language). When I show the movie I talk about The NY Brooklyn Museum graffiti art exhibit of a couple of years ago and mention that art collectors now purchase legal graffiti art. I do discourage illegal street art and encourage legal painting. The DVD shows street art styles.,1258329600,,412,4.9855072463768115
