2077983,4,B0002CX1OI,"I had never heard of this until I saw it at our local library, and it looked interesting enough to rent for our family movie night.  Though released in 1998, this movie feels more like a throwback to kids movies from the 1970s - the pacing is very relaxed, the tone is fairly dramatic, and action sequences take a backseat to character development.  The themes of the movie are endearing and enduring: family, honesty, courage, and love.  Add to that list growth, as most of the main characters learn valuable lessons by the movie's end: grandpa finds the courage to open up about some demons from his past for the first time; dad learns that money and career aren't worth the sacrifice of his relationship with his son, and he too finds the courage to start being honest about his own failings; and the son learns that courage and sacrifice are vital to family survival.  Most of the performances are solid, with Dennis Weaver in particular putting a lot of heart into his role.
All in all this is an enjoyable movie with a great heart and some positive messages.  I would warn that some of the actions sequences, though tame by almost all standards, may still be frightening to young watchers.  My 9 year old son enjoyed it and really got into some of the more suspenseful moments, but my 5 year old daughter found it too scary at times (e.g., when some blood is seen on the head of the injured pilot, when the protagonists' lives are threatened by a raging river, etc). If you have very young children or kids who scare easily, keep in mind there are some suspenseful and tense segments.  Otherwise, give this one a try - great messages delivered through a solidly enjoyable family flick.",1422576000,,1691,4.579470198675497

2077986,5,B0002CX1OI,"This is a very good movie. There were some things to find fault with about the script, such as the rescue team electing to save the 74-year old grandfather before the 11-year old grandson. I had to explain to my 5-year old grandson that you always save the youngest first and so that part of the movie was just plain wrong. But Dennis Weaver was outstanding in this role. I have the same relationship with my sons that you see in this film between Dennis Weaver and his son. But I expect that. The bible tells us that Jesus said that he did not come to bring peace but to set sons against fathers, daughters against mothers. So there is a lot of material to use to teach my grandson. Barbara Radecki was sensational in her role as wife and mother. I didn't know who she was prior to seeing this movie, but now I am a big fan. She was wonderful. I recommend this film. It is good for family viewing in spite of a poorly written script.",1410393600,,934,4.223463687150838
2077987,4,B0002CX1OI,This movie had a good storyline and was well acted. I would recommend this one.,1407283200,,79,4.333333333333333
2077988,4,B0002CX1OI,"Escape From Wildcat Canyon is a pretty good adventure/suspense.  It's light on the actual frightening scenarios (other than a certain wolf pack invasion and rapidly flowing river segments later on, of course).  Even the mountain lion acted more like a housecat the second he made an appearance.

Anyway the storyline is so good because of the grandfather (played by Dennis Weaver).  He kept a secret from him family all this time- he wasn't a cook in the war like he said, he was actually IN the war fighting for the lives of his buddies.  Anyway before I go on, let me mention why the grandfather and son are stranded in the wilderness.  It's nothing original or anything- their personal airplane suddenly goes down (rather unexpectedly and undramatic I couldn't help but notice) leaving the pilot, grandfather and his grandson fending for themselves in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah... we've seen this many times already but I'll give this movie a pass since it came out in 1998.  Of course you know what happens to the pilot.

The truth is, the reason the suspense isn't very compelling is because the story is mostly trying to build a relationship between a grandfather and grandson getting to know each other better while they're hiking all over the mountains to safer grounds.  Oddly, they never find themselves in a situation where they're running towards an airplane that barely misses them which is a popular clich with these type of films.  The pilot finds himself in this situation however.  The film isn't without a few inconsistencies.  They don't become noticeable until halfway through since the beginning of the film devotes so much time to the son and his father/mother discussing moving to New York City, which is exactly what the son (grandson) does NOT want because he'd rather hang out with grandpa fishing in the great outdoors and discussing stories.

Anyway some of the inconsistencies I noticed involve the grandson sliding down a rope off the side of a mountain and his backpack gets stuck in a bushy patch of sticks.  Wasn't the rope still hanging after the grandfather saved his grandson?  One of them could have used a stick or something to poke at the backpack and get it to drop... at least that's what I was thinking should've happened.  You'd think given the noticeable concern that the grandfather had going forward without his insulin injections in the backpack, he'd want to at least try *something* to get it back.  Instead he continues moving forward with his grandson which didn't seem believable given his worried facial expression, which results in future segments where he lies to his grandson whenever he asks his grandpa why he's not taking his insulin.

Another odd moment comes when the grandfather and grandson are sitting inside a cave and a German Shepherd arrives with a thorn in his paw.  The grandson simply walks up to the dog and removes it.  Knowing how uncontrollable dogs can be whenever they're feeling pain, the grandfather should have warned his grandson about removing the thorn, and the dog should have been flashing his teeth because let me tell ya- a dog won't simply stay calm while you remove a thorn from their paw.  The dog's going to feel a sharp jolt of temporary pain before feeling relief, but I can assure you the dog's going to respond with anger or at the very least yelping to the pain he feels.

These next ones are tied to SPOILERS so don't read them if you haven't watched the film yet.  When the grandfather and grandson are clinging on a branch while the rapidly flowing water nearly pushes them down the river, and the helicopter sees and attempts to rescue them, they choose to rescue the grandfather first.  To me that seems unreasonable given that a child should be first priority in such a situation, but I suppose since the position of the helicopter was closer to the grandfather this one's forgivable.  But then, why would they write a movie where the helicopter is closer to the grandfather?  Also... what kind of rescue team would go back for a dog after the kind of dangerous situation they just endured?  The kind of rescue team that doesn't want a kid to go home disappointed.

Other than these odd moments (and I don't mean to sound picky by bringing them up by the way- Escape From Wildcat Canyon is still a pretty good movie like I said above) it's a nice film.  The grandfather makes it interesting though because Dennis Weaver is an established actor.  Certainly not the mother who's easily replaceable, or the jerk of a father who cares about business more than family, or even the grandson who's only a so-so actor.  It's the grandfather we remember.  Also it's funny I'm watching this movie after watching After Earth a couple days ago.  The storylines are similar in that two family members are lost and need rescued.  In the case of After Earth it's set in the future and it's between a father and son, but it's still remarkable to me I'd happen to watch two movies with a similar theme only a couple days apart.",1406851200,,5015,4.731875719217491

2077990,5,B0002CX1OI,"Wasn't really expecting to much from this film but turned out to be a great watch and perfect for the kids. there is absolutely no foul language in it. And I mean none because I watch that closely. If all you want is great clean entertainment with the family then get this film. If you want sex crazed, violent, crude and demoralizing then pass.",1385510400,,345,4.40625
