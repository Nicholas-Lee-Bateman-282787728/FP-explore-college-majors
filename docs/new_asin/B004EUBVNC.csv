8580178,1,B004EUBVNC,"I ordered this DVD for a friend's birthday.  Because it was not Amazon shipping the item - after a week without hearing from the seller - Amazon sent me an email regarding this problem and that I could respond to that email to reach the seller, which I did.  I finally got notice from the seller that it was being shipped.  I received the DVD less than a week later (although it was now over a week past my friend's birthday).  The jacket to the DVD was very colorful and we were eager to watch it.  We noticed that the actual DVD inside the jacket had no markings on it at all.  The DVD was a total waste of time and a ripoff.  It only showed a total of 7 to 10 minutes of bits and pieces of this military tattoo and festival!  That was the extent of the program on the DVD!  This must have been a mistake - but the person sending this DVD should have been more careful of its content.  I am sending the DVD back for a refund and will complain to the Festival as soon as I have contact information for them.",1332028800,,1008,4.045454545454546
