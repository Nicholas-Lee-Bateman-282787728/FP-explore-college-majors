7562729,4,B01949JJOU,"While I wouldn't liken Chaplains to social workers, the movie does provide the general public with some understanding of the different functions of a chaplaincy profession and calling.",1455667200,2,184,5.607142857142857
7562730,5,B01949JJOU,"This inspiring documentary explores the lives of chaplains -- our unsung heroes that serve as spiritual advisors in an array of settings and faiths.  From a Catholic Military Chaplain in Afghanistan to a female Buddhist Chaplain in a men's maximum security prison in Oregon -- this film shows exactly what kind of heart it takes to sooth the fears and worries of others, while simultaneously pointing towards the bright light of hope.  What strength and courage these men and women chaplains have! Their compassion towards everyone -- no matter race, religion, or ideology -- has inspired me to look at my own life and those I love through the eyes and heart of a chaplain. A must see for the whole family!",1454976000,,706,4.778688524590164
8743881,4,B01949JJOU,"This shares the experiences of people who provide care/comfort/concern to those in such areas as the workforce (Tyson), a Hollywood retirement home(?), prison, racetrack, legislators, hospitals, and police. Insightful. Different faiths and situations appear. A large contingent of people of different faiths appeared in prison, hmmm.

Shares the difficulties and experiences that occur. The actor that played the priest in M*A*SH appears and shared what he aspired to bring to the roll. Insightful.",1512864000,,498,5.821917808219178

8743886,3,B01949JJOU,It was a good introduction to chaplaincy but could have gone deeper,1485561600,,67,4.666666666666667
8743887,5,B01949JJOU,"This is an excellent presentation of what chaplains do. It tells about chaplains in many settings, including the military, prisons, hospitals, businesses, etc. I was recalled to active duty in 1980 to help save the military chaplaincy in a suit filed by two lawyers who claimed the chaplaincy violates the first amendment which forbids the government from paying for chaplains. The lawyers argued that the Constitution prohibits chaplains because, among much else, it has the government promote religion. I argued that the lawyers overlooked another part of the first amendment that stated that the government may not prohibit the free exercise of religion of its citizens. If chaplains are forbidden in the military, and since civilian clergy cannot function on the battlefield and since civilian clergy are unable to fully understand the unique needs of the military, soldiers would be denied their free exercise of religion rights. We won the case.",1468972800,2,951,5.304635761589404

8743889,4,B01949JJOU,"I found this film to be a thought-provoking and inclusive exercise in re-imagining chaplaincy for the 21st century, moving away from a strictly ecumenical, Eurocentric perspective and into that of an interconnected and interfaith world.  Personally I would have preferred a little more focus and length on correctional chaplaincy, which is one of the most important areas for chaplaincy given the numbers of incarcerated women and men, not counting those on probation and parole.  I also wonder why traditional chaplaincy among law enforcement groups (police, fire, EMT, etc.) were left out, as well as airport chaplains.  Perhaps a second volume is needed to reach out to other forms of chaplaincy!",1459036800,3,699,5.336363636363636
8743890,5,B01949JJOU,All the films from Journey Films are outstanding. As a staff chaplain I especially appreciate this film. It is an excellent movie to show with small groups in a church setting.,1455667200,,176,4.709677419354839
