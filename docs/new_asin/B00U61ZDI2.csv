8704483,5,B00U61ZDI2,"Well made, a bit campy at times, this is a very fun horror satire.
While the story is convoluted, if you are a true horror fan, you will be able to pick out homages and easter eggs.
This is a good time film worth adding to any horror collection, suitable for Friday the 13th viewings, sleep overs and Halloween parties for sure!",1459123200,,328,4.306451612903226
