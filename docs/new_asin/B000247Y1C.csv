Of course I didn't understand a word (there are no English subtitles, or any subtitles at all for that matter), but the acting is so good and the storyline familiar enough to follow the action easily. The settings and costumes are magical, the music is beautiful and the actors, without exception, are brilliant.",1210636800,,464,4.8125
8021986,5,B000247Y1C,"The film starts with the words, ""This is a very old fairy tale that was first told many centuries ago and still lives, and everybody tells it in a different way"". The creators of the film ""Zolushka"", 1947 aka (""Cinderella""), told this old story with so much tenderness, humor, kindness, and style that it will be loved and watched by spectators of many generations, past and future, children and adults alike. ""Cinderella"" is the film of lasting and never aging charm. Its directing is effortless, the familiar plot never fails to captivate, the music by Antonio Spadavekkia is enchanting and absolutely fits the magic of the film. The old story is retold by Yevgeni Shvarts (who also wrote the screenplays to the masterpieces of Russian Cinema ""To Kill a Dragon"" (1991), ""Ordinary Wonder"" (1978), ""Twelve Chairs"" (1977), and ""Don Quixote"" (1957)), and he added the jokes that are still funny and biting after all these years. I have to say a couple of words about acting. The best Russian actors of the time participated in the ""Cinderella"". I would never forget a touchy but kind King (Erast Garin), tender and loving Zolushka (Yanina Zhejmo, who was 38 when she took a role but she was absolutely believable as 16 year old Zolushka), and one of my favorite actresses of all time, one and only Faina Ranevskaya as an evil but unforgettable Stepmother who believes that with her powerful connections she will rule the Magic Kingdom.",1154563200,4,1433,4.853061224489796
