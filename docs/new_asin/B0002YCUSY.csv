8034659,5,B0002YCUSY,Nice instructional DVD. It is a bit of an older DVD but still awesome stuff. I plan on getting the other more recent Portnoy DVD's but figured on starting with this one first. Great instruction and decent price.,1247443200,,211,4.578947368421052
8034660,5,B0002YCUSY,"Mike makes it looks SOOOOOO easy. His ability to improvise on complicated meters is simply amazing. What a drummer.

He breaks things down; then builds it up as his embellishments become more and more complicated.",1182124800,4,213,5.085714285714285
