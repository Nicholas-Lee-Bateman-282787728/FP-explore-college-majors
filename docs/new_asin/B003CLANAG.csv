4109809,4,B003CLANAG,Say these movies on tv before I bought this DVD.  I'm a big science fiction nut especially when it comes to dinosaurs!,1384300800,2,118,4.363636363636363
4109810,1,B003CLANAG,"This is a very amateurish version of these titles.  Basically just a few attractive women walking around (acting?) in the scenarios depicted by the titles.

4109815,5,B003CLANAG,I love these types of movies.  Some aliens or monsters are always challenging earth.  The excitement part is when and how we overcome that event.,1307577600,,145,4.76
4109816,2,B003CLANAG,I didn't like these movies at all. The special effects are bad. Will give it 2 stars because off Greg Evigan. He is the highlite off these movies even though he wasn't in them as much as I hoped.,1304812800,,195,4.0256410256410255
