5016932,4,B006TTC54K,"Fine collection of these old films....A fine review of the Stewart works any fan should review these classic pieces.
Of course the Eastwood movie is also a Western classic can be seen again and again.",1363219200,,200,4.742857142857143
5016933,5,B006TTC54K,"This is very nice collection of Universal Westerns from 30s to 70s. There are three DVDs and are like the ones if you buy the movies by themselves. ""High Plains Drifter"" is in color, Widescreen and runs for about 1hr and 46mins; ""Destry Rides Again"" is in b&w, full-frame and runs for about 1hr and 35mins; ""Winchester '73"" is in b&w, full-frame and runs for about 1hr and 33mins.

This collection provides English and French (only for High Plains Drifter)audio and English, Spanish and French subtitles. The quality of the movies are great and are the same as buying the movies separately. These movies star James Stewart, Clint Eastwood, Marlene Dietrich, Biran Donlevy, Dan Duryea, Shelley Winters, plus others.

Overall this is a great collection and I would recommend this if you don't already have any of these films.",1354320000,5,823,4.913669064748201

8504171,3,B006TTC54K,Winchester 73 and Destry Rides Again are enhanced for 16:9 - High Plains Drifter is apparently taken from the first non-anamorphic DVD release; it is not enhanced for 16:9. The price reflects this but it would be nice if it said so in the product description.,1515715200,,259,4.6521739130434785
