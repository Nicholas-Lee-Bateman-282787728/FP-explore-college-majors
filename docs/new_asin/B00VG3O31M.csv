7089118,5,B00VG3O31M,I love this movie. The ending is my favorite part. It is about a town where everyone has experienced loss. It shows how their lives are as they keep going. There is also a tree in the town where they hang medals from all the fallen.,1525824000,,232,4.065217391304348

7089129,1,B00VG3O31M,"The plot is just too overdone and predictable. Boy who acts out is sent somewhere to recuperate. He meets a girl (who's usually plain) and they start hanging out and fall in love. Along the way, boy finds himself and ALL of his problems are resolved. The plot is just as overdone with the boy and girl in opposite places. Did I say boy and girl? I meant Josh and Mary, the characters of this movie.",1499558400,,398,4.25
7089130,2,B00VG3O31M,"I didn't like some of the dance moves, it just doesn't fit with the music vice versa.  I'm as patriotic as it comes when seeing the American flag and an eagle, but that's about it (at the end).  Hated the stupid dance moves, really, really awful!!!!  Not happening (in real life) to see her kiss Josh right in front of the principal?!!  Anyway, I'll created my own ending and that Josh (main boy) enlisted in the Army.  He marries Mary before heading off, but comes back to reside in Indiana with his wife & family.  The end!",1493078400,,525,4.360824742268041
7089131,4,B00VG3O31M,"I like this movie enough to have watched it a few times, but the whole thing is kind of far-fetched.  For instance, high school students wouldn't be able to put together multiple dances complete with great moves, music, costumes, and props in a few weeks' time. Also, I never figured out the point of one of the dancers getting hurt and being out for all but the last performance. What was that about?  And some of the conversations with the shrink?  A real-life Josh wouldn't have admitted flipping for the dance troup made him feel good. Not a hard case like him.
Laura Dern did a fantastic job of being the mom, though. All that said, it's an enjoyable movie and I'd watch it again.",1492905600,,685,4.464
7089132,4,B00VG3O31M,"If nothing else, this movie clearly depicted that life is not a movie. It can not be rewound, fast forwarded, or ignored. Life does not stop once the credits have rolled. As unrealistic as this movie may or may not have been, loss, love, and regret are very real. This movie portrayed that with every scene and there is a lesson that can be learned from that if only viewers would learn to take cues from the storyline instead of looking for its flaws.",1492214400,,452,4.392857142857143

7089142,2,B00VG3O31M,"I wasn't feeling this movie. I thought the production/DJ aspects were extremely fake and corny. Maybe casual viewers won't mind, but someone who actually produces and mixes music will find how insanely ridiculous this movie is in that department. I mean it's so bad, it maybe the movie nearly unwatchable. The kid also constantly wears Beats headphones everywhere he goes. Beats are NOT producing headphones and it's nothing more than an obvious product placement ploy.

Also didn't care for the romance plot, so much I have nothing to say about it. Skip this one and go re-watch Titanic instead.",1477267200,3,596,5.02020202020202

7089150,2,B00VG3O31M,"I'm not really in the right demographic for this, but still I have enjoyed similar movies in the past. I was desperate for something to watch so I settled on this. Woe was me. How did they attract such a great cast and then squander it? Hey DJ, the guy who gave you the pill that nearly killed you? He's not your friend and you shouldn't be sad that he's avoiding your calls. Did father and son ever really acknowledge their relationship? The way the movie went it seemed like Duhamel was teen DJ's dad. And what about DJ's future, was it ever discussed? His dreams of Ibiza have been trashed by two years in Hickville, so now what?

But what slayed me was the final dance number, the battle scene. Words cannot describe the horror I felt watching it. And it went from awful to worse when the ""dead"" ""soldiers"" got up and started dancing (looking to me like zombies). A real small town, at least the adults, would have walked out on that dance number. Frankly they would have walked out on NYC DJ's music all along. The scenes with the school principal bobbing his head to the beat were goofy but totally unbelievable.",1474761600,,1118,4.427184466019417

It's all of those, and despite the stellar performances turned in by Josh Duhamel and Laura Dern, it's a little disjointed and heavy-handed to be a superb film.

7089201,5,B00VG3O31M,"Whoa, Bravetown is a *fantastic* movie!  Gripping storyline, characters and acting the entire way through with no issues anywhere.

After a teen (Lucas Till) overdoses and falls off a ladder while being a DJ (seriously I was expecting some broken bones after that fall) his messed up mother sends him to live with his father.  Before sending him off, she reveals something no mother should ever say to their kid- that is, that she never really wanted him.  Wow if my parents said that to me I'd be devastated for years.  I don't think I'd ever recover from it to be honest.  Anyway Lucas moves in with his dad, but unfortunately he's no better than the mother since he never wanted Lucas either.  The father has a laidback nonchalant ""I don't care about anything/do whatever you want"" attitude and has no desire whatsoever to reshape his angry son into a better person.  At first my impression of Lucas is that he's a rebellious punk who cares about nobody but himself and his music, but given the situation with his parents I can understand why he acts the way he does.  He knows his parents are bad.

Since Lucas knows an original form of hip hop, the dance team at his new high school immediately connects with his style since they're desperate for something different to try and win the dance competition after failing for 7 years I think it was.  Interesting they play Avril Lavigne's ""Skater Boy"" (a song I completely forgot about but I LOVE!) and Lucas is able to turn the song into something brand new in the hip hop genre, allowing the dance team to work with it.  As is typical for high school movies and is now a clich&eacute;, a group of jocks don't like Lucas hanging out with the girls in the dance group and give him a hard time.  Interesting they only cause trouble exactly one time after this, and then disappear from the script completely.  I guess the movie writers knew this was a predictable aspect of high school dramas.

Anyway Lucas meets a girl from the dance team who he likes (Katrina Norman) and because the court forces Lucas to attend guidance counselor meetings due to the overdose earlier, well it turns out this is no ordinary guidance counselor.  This guy is played by Josh Duhamel.  He's laidback, doesn't seem to care what Lucas does, and even encourages Lucas to watch competitive soccer matches on TV and eat pizza while never discussing anything meaningful until Lucas is the one who eventually gives in and questions what he's doing there if he's not going to actually receive any guidance.  This strikes me as hilarious- every scene that involves the guidance counselor.  Though it turns serious when Josh's character mentions personal information about a friend he lost in war.

Anyway there's a sadness looming over this entire small town.  It's that Katrina Norman lost her brother who was a soldier in war, and this has completely changed her family in a major way.  Now her mom (played by Kherington Payne) sits around the house sad and quiet waiting for her son to finally come home... but of course, he can't come home.  I knew something was off about Kherington's behavior and I thought it was cancer at first.  Luckily Katrina is an ambitious dancer who strives for success, and Jae Head (the younger brother) is boisterous enough to become friends with Lucas and keep everyone's spirits high.  Seriously these are really good characters.

Anyway there's a major storyline twist that occurs 20-30 minutes before the conclusion but I can't spoil it.  Let's just say there's a lot going on here concerning Katrina's brother who died.  Oh and spoiler- I loved how they dedicated his memory with a really incredible dance routine near the end.  It was a wonderful dance, and I'm by no means someone who admires dancing.  But this one was really great.  Anyway while Lucas and Katrina walk around talking to each other, they often get into arguments because the theme is Lucas refuses to open up and talk to Katrina about his parents, but Lucas gradually learns how to care about others feelings and how to accept others into his life.  You see Katrina doesn't know his life story because he's hush hush the whole time.  A GREAT storyline the way it revolves around Lucas learning to become a better person through other people's problems.

Everything about this movie is really excellent.  The drama portions are really splendid because I'm interested the entire time, and the writing keeps me connected to these characters in an unforgettable way.  The writing and presentation is really good (I LOVED that memorial tree for the soldiers- really unique).  Awesome!",1452211200,2,4611,4.761964735516373

And this is coming from a man that is 55 of age. It has creativity, drama, and a bold sense when a young man comes from a background at a night club and music and being very well known, and popular, and things are going pretty well, till he gets into drugs and falls and court orders him shipped out of town.

There was an implied reconciliation of father and son, and mother and daughter but only on the parents part. I guess you could call it an Edna Ferber ""Giant"" ending.  (That's a pun.)  Also the young girl's mother's sudden change in character caused me to consider what wonder drug she had taken.  You know why but, that quick?

Being positive the movie had an excellent story-line, easy to follow and moving.  The acting was above par and the actors believable.  It's a typical story-line, troubled big city boy sent to small town, a plot used in many movies, but done well here.  It's just a movie, so enjoy it.",1444435200,,764,4.438848920863309

Brian Friedman did an incredible job choreographing the movie. I thought Lucas Till and Kherington Payne did a great job and look forward to seeing more from them in the future.

What was portrayed in the movie the pain,checking out of reality, abandonment,anger.anxiety.is real life for soldier dealing family members. I have experienced it first hand myself. There are some military-themed shows I can't watch to this today due to my brother being a soldier serving in Iraq twice. The last dance number of the movie was being dedicated to her brother who died and those who made it back to US but have emotional issues generated from the war. Her mother finally accepted her oldest son was not coming home alive from the war. Her dance movements was a goodbye and I love you.
