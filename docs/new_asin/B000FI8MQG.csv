By the way, Barbara Eden is very much alive. And still extremely hot, actually.",1165622400,2,224,4.743589743589744
2566424,5,B000FI8MQG,"this DVD set would make a great addition to anybody's DVD collection since the shows are fantastic and lacks the degrading quality of shows such as Bewitched and I Love Lucy.  I was very eager to receive this DVD set since the show is at the top of my all-time-favorite TV shows and that list is very short.  I only wish Barbara Eden was still alive so i could thank her personally for her performance in such an outstanding show which is fit for people of all ages !!!  I LOVE YOU, BARBARA.

2566425,5,B000FI8MQG,"The sets are excellent with commentaries and special snippets.

Thank you for the memories SONY, for bringing back our beloved Jeannie (Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman).It was about time. When will we all get the remaining seasons? Don't keep us in suspense.",1162598400,3,254,5.0476190476190474
2566426,4,B000FI8MQG,"I'm not sure about every episode, but there are cuts in the second season.

 ""My Master The Rainmaker"" - What happened to the footage of all the rain in Alabama after Jeannie blinked and turned it into a lake?

 There are also some cuts in ""The Mod Party"" - the ones I noticed were after Dr. Bellows drove Tony & Roger into the woods to go hunting. Several lines of dialogue were cut, as well as a few scenes where they were trying to set up the tent.",1157414400,38,451,4.090909090909091
2566427,5,B000FI8MQG,"The DVD version is excellent. I highly reccomend it to any life long enthusiast of the series. It is also enjoyable to listen to in Spanish or Portugese (regardless of one's own knowledge of those lanquages).

2566430,5,B000FI8MQG,"With trepidation, I purchased the colorized version of ""Jeannie"" (season one) and was very pleased with the colorization.  About ten years ago, I purchased a colorized Gilligan's Island episode and the colors were wrong, not vivid and the actors eyes were red.  HOWEVER, it's obvious that computer technology has greatly changed and the color version of ""JEANNIE"" is superb in quality !",1147305600,15,386,5.209677419354839

Some of the plots were threadbare but we loved these characters and I guarantee you will feel good when you watch them again Patience with the 1960's values and sophistication.

2566491,5,B000FI8MQG,"I grew up watching this series in syndication usually paired with another paranormal comedy series, ""Bewitched."" The gorgeous, talented, and bright Barbara Eden plays 2,000 year old Jeannie. She pops up from her bottle on a beach when astronaut, Captain Anthony Nelson (played by the wonderful legendary Larry Hagman long before he was J.R. Ewing) finds her.

He frees Jeannie but she only wants to be with him. The first season is spent trying to get the psychiatrist  (Hayden Rorke) off Captain Nelson's back. The doctor is suspicious of strange happenings that always connect with Nelson. Bill Daily is wonderful as Captain Nelson's best friend and fellow astronaut, Roger. He soon learns Jeannie's secret.

The first season is completely shot in black and white about 30 episodes on 3 DVDs. The black and white episodes don't lose any of it's charm. The second season is shot in wonderful color but the series gets only better. The second season is about 31 episodes on 3 DVDs. There are no special extras in this DVD.

You won't find any special features like subtitles or interviews but as M.C. has copied from Sony's masters, the print and sound quality is quite good even with ten episodes per disc (11 on last disc).

The first season is in original black and white, and the Screen Gems logo has been included at the end of each episode - at least in all of the season 1 and 2 episodes I've seen so far. Episodes are listed on each disc and nice that the discs are not packed together on a spindle. I picked up my set from another seller for under $10.

Unlike the previous first year the series , like all U.S. network prime time shows, were finally broadcast in color. The color of the series made it more realistic, more enchanting and more beloved than ever.

 The second year, although not as popular as the first as the sitcom didn't finish in the Top 10, was funny, witty, magical and pure lighthearted fun.

2566562,4,B000FI8MQG,"With more positive changes, I Dream Of Jeannie truly begins to realize it's comic potential in its second season, due mainly to the genius and hard work of series creator Sidney Sheldon, who in addition to executive producing the series, wrote nearly all of the 31 episodes.  In season two, Sheldon continues to develop the relationships between the characters, introduces Amanda Bellows, and takes the series in new directions.  This was the first season to be shot in color, and also features a wonderful new theme song, composed by Hugo Montenegro.

The talented cast is headed by the vivacious (whee!) and stunningly beautiful Barbara Eden, who's comedic skills continued to bloom.  Now shot in color, the audience could fully appreciate Jeannie's sexy costume, and wonderful wardrobe.  As astronaut in training Major Anthony Nelson, Larry Hagman expanded his comedic repertoire, including more physical comedy.  Bill Daily as Major Roger Healy, Hadyen Rorke as Dr. Alfred Bellows, and Barton McLane as General Peterson, assumed larger and more defined roles.  Emmaline Henry was also introduced as Bellows' wife Amanda, bringing more quirkiness to an already eclectic group.

During its debut season, the series lacked direction, until Sheldon assumed the writing responsibilities, and began to refine the relationships between Jeannie, Tony, and the other central characters.  Season Two resumes with Tony continuing to do his best to remain in the space program, but there is more of an emphasis on Jeannie trying to convince Tony to marry her.  This season would also include several ""fantasy"" adventures set in various time periods, as Tony captains a pirate ship, visits with Napoleon Bonaparte, and plays a cowboy in the old West.

At a certain point, Dr. Bellows' attempts to catch Tony became a little too contentious, with the good doctor showing up at Tony's home a bit too often.  Sheldon seems to have recognized this, and although Alfred Bellows still maintains a very watchful eye, his interactions with Tony do soften over time.  Giving Bellows a wife makes him seem more human, and less maniacal.

One of this season's highlights is ""My Master, The Rich Tycoon"", which features Paul Lynde as an IRS agent, determined to see Tony pay taxes on artworks Jeannie has blinked into his home.  Another memorable episode is ""You Can't Arrest Me, I Don't Have a Driver's License"", where Jeannie takes Tony's convertible out for a spin, and gets stopped by an overzealous cop (Alan Hewitt), who then tries to get Tony convicted of bribery.

""My Incredible Shrinking Master"" has a creative premise, and is also interesting from a technical standpoint, as Jeannie accidentally shrinks her master down to a few inches in height, leaving a tiny Tony on the run from a hungry cat.  In ""What's New Poodle Dog?"",  Jeannie transforms Roger into a dog, to prevent him from telling Tony that they have a double date with a couple beauty queens, leaving Tony at the dog pound searching for his best friend.

In ""My Master, The Swinging Bachelor"", Amanda Bellows observes that Tony Nelson should not be gaining weight, eating only his own cooking, so to remove suspicion, Tony stages a dinner party.  Foreshadowing future events, Mrs. Bellows convinces her husband to check up on Roger and Tony's activities, in ""The Mad Party"".  Interestingly, this episode was not written by Sidney Sheldon, and is one of few to predominantly feature the mod and swinging aspects of 60's culture, with music and lots of dancing.

Under the firm guidance of Sidney Sheldon, I Dream of Jeannie makes major strides during its second season, expanding the ""Jeannie universe"" that Sheldon had established near the end on the first season.

doing some great family comedy. The show was intended to compete with ""Bewitched"", and it is a very similar premise, but the type
of humor is quite a bit different. The humor in this show is wilder with more semi-slapstick in it.

You also get to meet her sister (Jeannie with dark hair) four times during the season. There are one or two episodes that leave you with a ""what were they thinking?"" But overall the show is a great collection to own. I bought it to introduce my son to some of the shows I watched as a kid and he seemed to like this show quite a bit (even more than ""Get Smart"" and ""Bewitched"").

Although, I should warn you: My son (8) loaded it on his iPod and watched an episode on the school bus. One of the children complained to their parents he was watching an inappropriate show on his iPod with naked women. As a result I had to speak to the parents and assure the school he had nothing of the sort on his iPod. My how times have changed... but then again, maybe not.",1224547200,3,936,4.086956521739131

It's as if I were viewing it for the first time.

Sony says it all. They have proven it so many times by now, it is almost useless to repeat it.

This is how DVDs of old movies and TV shows should be cleaned up and presented to a demanding audience.
It really should be imposed as the standard in DVD production.

Just look at the ""Ultimate Bond Collection"" and you will see what I mean.

When SONY gets at producing something they really work at the material and they probably sweat over it too, 'cause the results are simply unique.

Even Criterion could take them as an example (and I am now referring to their unfortunate ""Last Emperor"" DVD release, which is simply not worth buying).

I hope SONY will take care of many more movies in the future and never allow their standard to drop.",1222128000,,860,4.405063291139241

If you've never seen this show, I definitely reccomend it. Major Tony Nelson of NASA lands on a beach by accident and finds a bottle with a beautiful 'Jeannie' in it. Jeannie falls in love with him (and he with her,though he won't admit until much later), and in each episode unintentionally wreaks havoc on his well-ordered life, by trying to help. Played to ditzy,lovable perfection by the gorgeous Barbara Eden,with Larry Hagman of 'J.R Ewing' fame as Tony. It's fun to see Hagman in a character so completely different from J.R.

If you have never seen this before you are missing ALOT.

I love the fact that this is innocent yet sexy.
The costumes are eye candy and the special effects was great for its day.
But most importantly it is HILARIOUS how Jeannie is always getting into one mess after the other often getting Major Nelson into trouble.

Jeannie's charachter is naive, yet smart, sexy and overly jealous of her Master(who freed her by the way when he opened that bottle).

Major Nelson is handsome, and good hearted but hasn't learned that he cant control Jeannie and he definetly takes her for granted all the while masking his feelings for her.

Major Healy is his selfish yet lovable best friend(who knows about Jeannie).

Dr Bellows is the military space base psychiatrist who is always getting into trouble with all the Generals because he cant prove something is amiss with Major Nelson.

This season his wife Amanda is on the show causing more problems for Major Nelson.

This is simply the best sitcom to ever hit the TV screen.

As a child, I couldn't fully appreciate the writing and comic timing but as an adult, I see how great the show really was.  Both my husband and I would laugh out loud watching it all over again.  Major Anthony Nelson and Major Roger Healy had the funniest lines and worked so well together.

2566607,4,B000FI8MQG,"The 1966 season of I DREAM OF JEANNIE features some of the best storylines, building on the relationship of Major Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) and his faithful Jeannie (Barbara Eden).  Barbara Eden's performance as Jeannie is a little more comical in the second year, whilst adding a lot of underlining pathos and heart to the character.

The supporting roles of Roger Healey (Bill Daily) and Doctor Bellows (Hayden Rorke) were also expanded, and we get to see more of Bellows' wife Amanda (Emmaline Henry).

This season was the first to be filmed in colour.  You'll notice in the earlier episodes that Barbara Eden's makeup is very pronounced and dark (probably because the makeup artists were still applying Jeannie's makeup as originally designed for the grayscale tones of b&w).  The addition of colour added a lot to the magic and scope of the show.  Just like it's sister sitcom ""Bewitched"", the possibilities were endless, and the world of Jeannie is nicely-developed in this second year.
