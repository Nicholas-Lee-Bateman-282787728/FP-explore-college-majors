There are several types of dance, but they aren't explained well unless you already have a dance background, and all of them seem impractical/irrelevant.  I'm not really looking to learn latin infused broadway.  He explains long sets with little breakdown, then the viewer is thrust into the 'performance' set. I viewed/tried this video one time, and it's now sitting on my desk, gathering dust.  I could find better dance instruction on Youtube.",1212969600,,481,5.128205128205129
8260517,5,B0015YVNJC,"This video is hot!! Whether you are a beginner or advanced at Latin styles, you can pull so much away from Luis's clear instruction and the amazing choreography in the music video sections. I got his DVD, and it's jam-packed with zesty, spice-filled moves and just all around mad flavor!",1207180800,,287,4.76

HINT:  The music videos at the end are almost intoxicating because you're pumped from knowing that you've just learned to dance, and the encore makes you feel like you're in the audience of a premiere show-and you recognize all the steps!

Luis Salgado's talent and passion are on fire in your DVD player, and Latin Fusion is one that will inspire you because of his humble teaching style and exciting voice for learning.  You might even start rolling your R's with each shimmy!

The difference is learning from a pro; from a native.  With Luis originating from Puerto Rico, and currently residing in NYC, you have the best of both worlds:  a true teacher of Latin dance, matched with the savvy etiquette of a dance instructor from the Big Apple.  As the owner of a marketing firm, and having surveyed dancers and dance teachers about what they want to see in their instructional videos-an overwhelming majority exclaimed:  Originality.  By the time you finish this DVD, you're swaying your hips to Salgado's original choreography and you have the opportunity to watch the productions of an emerging world-renowned dance genius.  Me Gusta!  Encore!
