8592495,4,B00DEA2MYK,"Saw this film on a United Airlines flight to Honolulu, just as an impulse to avoid the usual American films. What a treat! Silly slapstick, with delightfully absurd translation subtitling. Crouching Tiger meets the Keystone Kops. I'm not particularly enamored of Kung Fu movies, but this one was a real knee-slapper. What a shame Amazon doesn't have a Region 1 DVD for us here in the states, if there is even one available. I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Classic Chinese cinema? Who cares- it's great entertainment!",1381363200,3,511,4.885057471264368
