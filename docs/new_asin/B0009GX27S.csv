8060432,3,B0009GX27S,No disappointments; a made for TV piece of schlock that I thankfully bought used.  Acting was O.K.  Story a bit stale but it was entertainment.,1483920000,,143,4.68
8060433,4,B0009GX27S,Good made for TV movie. Based on a true story.,1419638400,,46,3.7
8060434,2,B0009GX27S,I don't think the facts support the movie. A bank break-in like this one should not be as corney/lame as this flick goes... 'The Cops are Robbers' is a very good read and true as it was written by one of the more interesting members of the bunch. Get the book.,1246492800,,260,4.117647058823529
