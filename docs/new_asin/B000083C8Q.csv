For our first night, I was a bit too tired to stay awake thru thirty minutes, but she stayed with it for over half. The next evening we both finished it with an absorbing interest... Yet we had questions about the length of timing from the beginning in Oxford all the way thru Ganeesh getting married to writing his first book, the dabbling with politics, becoming a famous healer, then his fame as author and political figure leading him back to Oxford.
We commented on the good acting, the scenery of Trinidad, their cultures and great contrasts with England and India. Yet we still had questions about the central personalities and the unique images of their change from ""country-like common people"" who suddenly matured into readers with a quickly developed background to give them remarkable powers of healing, judgment and wisdom. All in all, I have a temptation to pass the movie off to three friends who might have some interest in suggested  Theology of their Hindu thinking about the spiritual gifts of Pundit in his ability to heal both body and spirit!
It may well be that leaving the story open-ended was intentional with potential results of allowing more questions for discussion and word-of-mouth advertising of such an engrossing story!

7978640,4,B000083C8Q,"It must have been challenging to transform Naipaul's remarkable novel, which so marvellously captures mid-20th century Trinidad. Yet I think the screenplay is solid, and the acting good. And so I look beyond the disconcerting pseudo-Trinidadian accents, and instead revel in the landscape and the humour.",1377388800,,304,5.630434782608695

7978643,4,B000083C8Q,"This is an unusual Merchant/Ivory film that focuses on the  Indian community of Trinidad from 1943 to about 1954.  It focuses in particular upon a young teacher, who takes a wife, outfoxes her wily, grasping  father, and lives in the country, desiring only to write books. Still, he has to earn a living, so he becomes a masseur, which is not a masseuse, but rather, a healer. He also writes a books on Hinduism, which he publishes himself. He becomes known as the Mystic Masseur and develops a country wide following.
His book and those books that follow are quickly bought up by a now adoring public who revere him as a Pundit. A brief career in politics soon follows, only for him to discover that an adoring public can turn fickle. The film meanders along, as does this pundit's life. With first rate cinematography and stellar performances by the entire cast, this is a very good, though unusual, film. Those who are interested in other cultures will find this film of some interest.  If you are not so inclined, deduct one star from my review.",1050969600,7,1049,4.623655913978495
7978644,5,B000083C8Q,"i agree with the comments made about the lack of storyline and the slightly abrupt ending to the movie. frankly though, the time period and culture depicted in the movie was engrossing enough to make me forget about the storyline. the language, the scenery, the characters, the blend of cultures, the simplicity and the quest for little pleasures, all of that came together to make a movie, quite superbly different than most of the stuff i have seen recently. i smiled, and occassionally laughed, through the whole thing. it really isn't about sending your brain circuits on fire while looking for ""so what happens""...its just about that movie watching experience, one that sends you off onto a journey to a different place in a different time where all these characters become your friends (and foes) and maybe the pace and climax of the movie is because its originally a book. i truly recommed it to all.its refreshing!",1048636800,12,922,4.8789808917197455
