7811004,5,6301144775,"Hi there, just watched this video tape; from the library.

The hostess is older, great to follow and very practical, common sense advice. Lots of topics covered. Everything you need to know to make a flower garden; plant types, selection, soil types, troubles with and remedies..., mulching, and drip irrigation and how to put it all together. A terrific tape much better than the newer ones. This was made in 1987 I believe.",1100563200,,425,4.821917808219178
