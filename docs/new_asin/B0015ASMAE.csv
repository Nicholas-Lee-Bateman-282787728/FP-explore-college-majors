8257992,2,B0015ASMAE,"I have watched quite a few of the 'Massage Nerd' DVDs and unfortunately this one was not the best.
I am studying for the Diploma of Reflexology and I never understood why my teachers always stressed that 'Reflexology is NOT foot/hand massage'. By watching this movie I understand the difference very clearly. This DVD is very much a massage of the hand and foot but I didn't need this video for that as Swedish and Deep Tissue and Stretching very much cover this.
This movie is in my view not worth the money as I was hoping to have a visual reminder of my lectures however I was quite disappointed with what I saw. Whilst there was factually nothing really wrong with what the narrator said it felt more like he was 'poking around the foot' rather than showing the audience what reflexology is.
Very slim in regards to actual reflexology and I can't recommend it.",1271635200,2,864,4.544871794871795
