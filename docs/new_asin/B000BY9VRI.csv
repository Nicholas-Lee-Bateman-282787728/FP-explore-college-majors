2445484,1,B000BY9VRI,"Don't be fooled.  This isn't a new workout, it was previously released as Get Moving: Walking for Weight Loss.  It is a great workout, one of my favorites, but if you own the other DVD you already own a copy.",1132531200,51,208,4.175
2445485,4,B000BY9VRI,"I've used Madeline's workouts before.  I had ""Califoria Burn"" on a vhs for many years and would love to find it on dvd but I guess it doesn't exist.  I wore out my vhs and found this one.  It's a good workout but not as good as her ""California Burn"".  I do this one everyday... It's fast and easy.",1332460800,,297,3.983050847457627
2445486,1,B000BY9VRI,"From here on out, I am reading all Amazon reviews as they help with customer satisfaction. This is the SAME program as Get Moving! Walking for Weight Loss as well as Cardio Walk for Weight Loss. Apparently Gaiam thought they could sell the same thing three times. Well at least I was only fool enough to buy it twice. It is a good workout overall & I am giving one copy to my friend.",1292976000,2,383,4.1891891891891895
2445487,5,B000BY9VRI,"This is a fun, well-produced workout that offers effective low-impact movements based on simple steps:  walking in place, kicking, lifting legs, hamstring curls, etc.  Intervals of aerobic work are interspersed with strength training for lower body (no weights or special equipment required).  The setting is outdoors, the scenery very attractive, and the production first-rate.  I've been using this DVD for about a year now, and have not gotten tired of it yet.  The exercises are well-cued, safe, and effective.",1238716800,4,514,5.455696202531645
2445488,5,B000BY9VRI,"I really enjoyed this workout.  It pushed me hard but when I finished I felt terrific.  I also worked up quite a sweat and was breathing hard.  I find that I don't feel very challenged w/Leslie Sansone's dvds, although I do like them.  This workout offers and amped up version as well as a modified.  Easy to learn, too!",1233187200,2,320,4.3559322033898304
2445489,4,B000BY9VRI,"I own Get Moving - Walking for Weight Loss - a favortie and regular in my exercise program. I was looking for more of Madeleine's workouts. I read only a couple of the reveiws and missed the one that heads warning this is only a RE-RELEASE of Get Moving - Walking for Weight Loss.
When I got the DVD I had a sinking feeling I got a dupe (or got duped). I expect a bit more from Gaiam.

Long and short if you do not own Get Moving both (obviously) are a wonderful workout with three 10 minute sections and three levels to work at. Good lead ins - nice variety of movements and a soothing cool down.",1201910400,6,597,4.059322033898305
2445490,5,B000BY9VRI,"Bought this for wife. She said it is very effective and nice value for money. Don't think, just go for it.",1193529600,,106,4.095238095238095
2445491,1,B000BY9VRI,"I bought this based on other reviews and the blurbs on the packaging that promised ""four 10-minute workouts."" Because my time is sometimes limited, I look for flexibility. The packaging and her blathering on the DVD falsely claim you can use this to squeeze in 10-minute workouts - except it's not set up to allow you to do just that at all.

You can't select just one of the 3 ""workouts"" or cooldown. It's really 3 segments that increase in intensity. You either select the entire workout or you select the Custom feature. The problem here is that the so-called ""custom"" feature *requires* you to choose 4 ""segments"" - not just one - to continue. That means you have to choose 35-40 minutes of workout when you may just want to do (or have time for) 10 or 20 minutes.

The whole thing also starts off with a completely unnecessary and time-wasting introduction about the benefits of walking and the convenience of using this DVD. Worse, you can't simply skip this at the beginning like you can on either exercise DVDs. You either have to fast-forward through it or choose the ""custom"" feature to select the required 4 segments.

Luckily my local used bookstore accepts used DVDs, because that's where this one is going.",1184544000,9,1220,4.691588785046729
2445492,5,B000BY9VRI,"I absolutely love this exercise workout. It is pretty easy as far as the moves go, and it is fun, so you don't get bored with it. It is great having the quick 10 minute workouts too- they fly by! I would recommend ""Cardio Burn"" to anyone!",1173312000,3,238,4.085106382978723
2445493,5,B000BY9VRI,"The setting for this workout is in a garden pavillion and it is absolutely beautiful.  Madeleine Lewis is a good instructor and cues the workout well.  There are three ten minute aerobic ""walking"" segments that each end with some lower body toning and balancing, and then there is also a really fantastic 10-minute stretch.  A  nice feature is that you can program the DVD to do the segments in any order you want, or to do certain segments more than once and others not at all.",1144713600,6,478,4.523255813953488
2445494,5,B000BY9VRI,"This is an excellent at home exercise DVD that does not have a lot of fancy or hard moves and does a great job to get your heart rate into your target zone.  All you need is a DVD player and a small open space to perform it.  It is split into 3 different 10 minute workouts and 1 cool down section.  You can pick which ones you want to do or do all of them in succession.  It gives you a good 30 minute workout.  The instructor is excellent, moving through each sequence of the workout and allowing plenty of time to get the moves she is doing down.  The instructor isn't a freakishly upbeat aerobic fanatic and doesn't make you feel like you have to have a PhD in dance moves.  This is a great beginners workout DVD and is tough enough for someone who has been exercising for a long time to add something new to their regiment.

I recommend this highly.",1139270400,20,854,4.133333333333334
8093966,5,B000BY9VRI,Deserves 10 stars!,1461110400,,18,5.333333333333333
8093967,3,B000BY9VRI,I didn't like this. I only tried it because I liked Madeline Lewis' stretching tape.,1451606400,,84,4.666666666666667
8093968,1,B000BY9VRI,it did not last a year I just reorder another from another,1446163200,,58,3.9166666666666665
8093969,1,B000BY9VRI,"I don't really care for this workout routine. Madeleine Lewis moves too fast through the short warm-up before getting into the higher impact steps. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend it for absolute beginners who are just starting out. I was so stiff and uncomfortable after using this routine and I'm not new to exercise. It's much higher impact than I expected. The menu states that you can choose which routines you want to do but, you must program all 4, even if you don't do them all. So you have to hit the stop button on your remote. This is a petty gripe but shows that this disc is not completely user-friendly. I have since moved on to Leslie Sansone videos which are way better IMO. Leslie's routines are more thorough with longer warm-ups and gradual increases to faster steps with cool downs at the end. Leslie is also more encouraging and supportive which really helps to keep you going. I sold this video to a used book store.",1441065600,,944,4.5588235294117645
8093970,4,B000BY9VRI,"I thought I'd add my two cents about this workout. At this point, according to VF standards, it's an ""oldie"", but I think that VFers who like walking type workouts could enjoy it. It is one that I have come back to because I lost a lot of fitness over the past year and I'm restarting my fitness efforts.

There are 3 cardio segments, ""walking"" type movements with a strength move at the end of it. And, there's a stretch. You can play the entire workout or customize it by choosing which segments you want to play.

Madeline is backed up by two exercisers, one does the ""easy"" modifications and the other does the ""harder"" modifications. Madeline, despite saying she'll be the intermediate exerciser is all over the place.

I keep this workout because it seems really well planned to me. It seems to just flow from one move to another. And, I enjoy that. I also can find it somewhat boring some days, so I keep it for the days that I'm in the mood for it.

Instructor Comments:
I really like Madeline as an instructor. She gives good form pointers and she's encouraging, but she doesn't chatter.

Warning:
Get Moving with Madeline Lewis and Cardio Burn are the same workout!  Gaiam loves to re-release workouts under different names.",1422489600,,1234,4.586363636363636
8093971,4,B000BY9VRI,"Good, honest workout.  No fancy footwork.  Gets your heart rate up.  BUT Get Moving and Cardio Burn are EXACTLY THE SAME WORKOUT.",1419724800,,129,4.7727272727272725
8093972,5,B000BY9VRI,I really appreciate the fact that it is broken up into sessions.  The workouts are very effective and fun!,1413417600,,106,4.578947368421052
8093973,5,B000BY9VRI,"I use this Cardio Burn DVD for my exercise,  especially when you can't go outdoors in bad weather",1408233600,,97,4.388888888888889
8093974,5,B000BY9VRI,"This routine is taught at a nice pace and includes lower body sculpting moves. I was pleasantly surprised by Madeline Lewis teaching style. She is a seasoned professional and yet I haven't done a video by her. I love the routine , the length and intensity will really burn fat and the beautiful garden setting is very motivating. I just wish there were more routines like this by Madeline Lewis !",1368144000,,396,4.591549295774648
8093975,5,B000BY9VRI,Love the way  it makes me feel. Challenging and satisfying! I sweat a lot so it's doing what I need it to do.,1364428800,,109,3.739130434782609
