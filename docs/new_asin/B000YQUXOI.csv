8470854,5,B000YQUXOI,"This DVD, although made for PAL, works fine on a computer. It shows, in New Yankee Workshop fashion with a twist of stereotypical English-countryside classical music, how to  pull apart two 100 year old books and sew them together within a leather cover with gold-tooling.  One thing that that stood out to me was that he bound the book in leather using PVA, as opposed to paste, probably because he fast enough to cover the boards before the PVA set. That aside, I think it was pretty well done.  It was easy to follow, with only a few things left to the imagination as how he did it.  This would be where experience would really pay off. The gold tooling was done using gold foil and heated tools.  He doesn't go into a lot of detail into HOW to tool properly, but you can follow along and do reasonably well. I would suggest a tools list in the beginning, and also a materials list. Watch it a few times before attempting to do this on your own, unless you have prior experience.

Peter Goodwin seems very knowledgeable and is full of fun stories.  It made the DVD entertaining as well!

I used this DVD as a reference, as I was trained slightly differently.",1220572800,,1161,4.417840375586854
8470855,1,B000YQUXOI,"This DVD was a severe disappointment ... although it was clearly listed on Amazon as being in the NTSC format it turned to be PAL and therefore unplayable on North American DVD players.  I returned it and was sent a replacement which turned out to be the same unusable format.  It's too bad, because I own an earlier DVD in this series by this gentleman and it is excellent ... he is a very good teacher.",1209081600,3,404,4.302631578947368
