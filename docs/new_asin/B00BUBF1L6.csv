And maybe it has so many comedy skits in it with different people that it can seem like you're not getting it, the big IT of the Woman.

5674690,5,B00BUBF1L6,"I liked this film because I know Korea is a little behind the US as far as women and womens rights, etc. But....this film sure did make a statement that a woman can be a wife and Mom, maybe a little depressed, have to go and get her husband from some bad guys and still remember the fish!! Woman are strong. OK, I know it's a confusing statement, but you will understand if you watch it. And.....if you watch it you will be glad you did. Very good.",1375056000,,448,4.1022727272727275

5674693,5,B00BUBF1L6,Great movie. The power of a strong woman to protect husband and her child against all odds.  All set in the most unusual situation with comedy as its side kick.,1370908800,8,160,4.333333333333333

5674695,4,B00BUBF1L6,"Spoiler alert, right up front..

This is a super annoying film, because ALL the characters are super annoying...except maybe the baby; and because It is like ""Dumb and Dumber"" meet a PG version of ""Goodfellas"". Which for me is annoying, just as a plot's tone.

So it's a comedy. I NEVER laughed at all during ""Dumb and Dumber"", but my spouse nearly fell out of the chair laughing. Takes all kinds.
Or it's a horror film, IF you imagine ANY of your children would ever grow up like these idiots.

BUT, you begin to see something you like in the idiot, whining, lazy heroine. You see some backbone, some worth, some courage...and you begin to rout for her

Her husband just made me want to throw up. The culture also was materialistic, and selfishly immature. Since I deal with enough irritation involuntarily in my life; my fingers itched to turn the rotten movie off...except that the heroine was developing in an interesting way.

And in the end....the movie delivered enough for me to feel like I actually liked it.",1444262400,2,1017,4.659217877094972
5674696,3,B00BUBF1L6,"I've enjoyed watching several South Korean romantic comedies, but is it seems that two thirds of them seem to have a ""Gangster"" side theme?  Really get tired of that.  Is South Korean life that dominated by Gang cultures?",1441497600,,221,4.7894736842105265

5674699,1,B00BUBF1L6,"It's so boring that I couldn't make it past 30 minutes....

I would skip this movie.

There are way better movies such as:
- Rough Cut
- Hello Ghost
- The Grand Heist
- My Girl and I
- Sad Movie
- Secret Reunion (Korean movie)
- daisy (Korean movie)
- Once Upon a Time in Seoul (Korean movie)
- Couples (English Subtitled)",1437091200,,322,4.095238095238095
5674700,4,B00BUBF1L6,Doona Bae is a fun actress to watch. Pop Culture fun. Watch for a laugh.,1422144000,,72,3.8666666666666667
5674701,4,B00BUBF1L6,"The husband is drugged and gets in trouble with nefarious nightclub types and won't be released until his fakey $2900 bar tab is paid.  His wife goes to rescue him and runs into other gangster types who chase her while she tries to get to the bar where her husband is being held.

Bae Doona is so cute and funny in this slap sticky comedy.  First saw her in great Japanese movie ""Linda Linda Linda"" and fell in love with her!  She has played in US movies (""Cloud Atlas"") and many Korean movies and dramas.  Loved seeing her running like crazy with baby strapped to her back!  Have not seen a movie or drama with her that wasn't very enjoyable.",1412899200,,643,4.316666666666666

5674703,2,B00BUBF1L6,"I just cannot figure out how so many people would feel this movie is worth even four stars, never mind five.

Amazon sums up the story pretty well, other than leaving out just how annoying this husband and wife pair are. After his first day at work, Ju-tae winds up on a night out on the town with his boss and coworkers. Eventually he's had enough -- way too much, actually -- and heads home on his own. A scoundrel whose specialty is apparently working for an operation that picks up drunks off the street and claims that they've run up a huge bar bill, runs the scam on Ju-tae, asserting a bill of over $1500.

Having watched and enjoyed a large number of the Korean films on Amazon, I've noticed that much of the dialogue comes across as a bit whiny, especially in the comedies. Most of the time, it's done in a subtle way and if anything, gives the language a bit of a melodic aspect to it. Here, it's just plain annoying. The whining is over the top.

At the same time, it was impossible for me to get to a point where I gave a hoot what happened to the unlucky couple. Guem-soon is spoiled rotten and Ju-tae has no respect for himself, being both hen-pecked and abused by his employer. And how anyone in this day and age, in a modern city like Seoul, could receive a threat of violence over what's an absurdly high bar tab, and not just go straight to the police, is beyond me.

Bottom line: even if one suspends disbelief and buys into the highly implausible story line (even by normal movie-making standards), it's highly unlikely there would be enough empathy for the protagonists to induce the viewer to bother wasting another hour or so finding out what happens to them.

This movie gets one star above the minimum, as credit for the relatively high production values. The acting, photography, and sound are all above-average. It's just that they are all in service of a story that just didn't need to be told.",1412380800,,1922,4.43342776203966

5674705,4,B00BUBF1L6,"There is a vast hidden treasure in South Korea's version of Hollywood. You just have to get past the subtitles.  Learn a bit about the culture so you can better understand the humor and meaning of what your seeing.  I thought tv was hopelessly boring.. i had watched all the joy out of it..  Then wandering the internet i came across a independent film festival winner.. so watched it.. it was Korean.. and wow.. so i watched 2 more.. and again wow wow.. and now i am hopelessly addicted to Korean movies and drama's.  I thought Saving My Hubby was a decent watch.  Some other good ones to watch to get your possible if not probably addiction going are Il Mare, yeonriji, my sassy girl,  My tutor friend, my 11th mother, ride away, poonsong, oasis, now and forever, Joint security area, failan, i am the king, greatly secretly, Blind, always, a millionaires first love.  and there are many many more.. When your ready for the big time.. check out Jewel in the palace.  or Winter sonata, or stairway to heaven, or lovers in paris, or my girlfriend is a gumiho.  these last ones are Korean Drama's.  they are like 16 - 90+ hour movies. in 1/2 or 1 hour episodes.  Closer to just being long movies than being like any us soap opera.",1411689600,,1229,4.466367713004484

5674712,5,B00BUBF1L6,"This movie offers some humorous insights into contemporary Korean culture. The characters and story are warm-hearted but a little wacky. Like most Korean scripts, the writing is tight, with each scene having later significance. After watching, I found myself trying to find any k-dramas Bae Doo Na has starred in.",1391644800,,313,5.28

After hours of drinking, Hubby falls into the clutches of  an unscrupulous bar owner who sticks him with a jacked up bar tab for everyone's drinks.  The bar owner calls Geum-sum  and tells her that he is holding her husband hostage until she comes down to the bar and settles the tab.

This movie is about a heartwarming young newly married couple with a new baby both  are struggling with parenthood. The mom is struggling more than her husband because she use to be a  great sport star with a huge following ,now she a mom and wife and she is unhappy,but she really loves her hubby and baby but misses her independence. I don't want to spoiled it by going into to much detail, but its like Holly Hunter in Raising Arizona, when she has to rescue daddy  played by Nicholas Gage.... when his diaper stealing goes bad. This young mother has the funny night from hell trying to rescue her  husband from scam artist all done with baby in tow. REALLY A GOOD WATCH AND FUNNY",1453161600,,748,4.391304347826087
