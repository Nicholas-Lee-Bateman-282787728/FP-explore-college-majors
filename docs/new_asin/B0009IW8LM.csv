It is a wonderful movie about the life of awesome animals, truly memorable.",1365552000,,172,4.40625
8061369,4,B0009IW8LM,"This was about Snowflake, an albino primate that lived in a Spanish zoo.  (He was on the cover of Basement Jaxx's CD, which I didn't think was that great.)  The poor animal had his family killed by humans because they knew it would be worth money.  At first, the zoo had him in a concrete environment all alone.  Later, a typical primate lives with Snowflake.  Although animals, it did kinda reminds me of Wonder's and McCartney's ""Ebony and Ivory.""  It was interesting to see that the black primate recognized itself in a mirror, but Snowflake couldn't.  The zoo hoped Snowflake would have albino offspring, but he never did.  They show him touchingly taking care of his granddaughter, but sadly they say only six of his 22 offspring lived into adulthood.  I heard the Spanish city died when Snowflake was put to sleep and I must admit I'm a little sad that he's gone too.  Luckily, this DVD can remind viewers of this unique animal.",1337644800,,934,4.640243902439025
