654266,5,6303445578,"As with every production I've ever seen with Domingo, his acting as well as his wonderful voice and musicality provide a powerful experience for the viewer. This opera is no exception. Andrea Chenier is a strong performance with a story that not only makes sense - (many opera stories are just plain silly) but actually provides a sense of history at the same time. I enjoyed this production very much. The supporting cast is also very strong. Production values are good. This is the only opera of Giordano that I've ever seen so I can't compare it. But I thoroughtly enjoyed this  one. Domingo with his dramatic intensity was the focal point of this opera. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this opera.",1326672000,3,709,4.717741935483871
654267,5,6303445578,"I am 70 years old and have always known about this opera, but I never actually viewed it...I presumed it to be a second or third class ""Puccini"".

After seeing this production, I must say that it is on a par with Puccini's Manon Lescaunt if not the on the level of the other big threes of Boheme,Tosca and Butterfly...The famous final duet before the ill fated lovers go to the guillotine is wonderful.

The performance is magnificent and features great artists in their prime. The  costumes, sets, orchestral playing,and direction are all as you might expect from a Covent Garden production.",1311897600,4,592,4.784313725490196
654268,5,6303445578,"Over the years, I have sat spellbound and amazed by incredible performances by the likes of Frank Langella, Anita Morris, Patti LuPone, Judd Hirsch, Diahann Carroll and even Patrick Cassidy on Broadway, and have been mesmerized by stellar, live performances of Aida and Nabucco in the San Francisco Opera House, but I don't remember ever being so completely transported by wonderful singing on my own big screen television than I was as I watched the wonderful performance captured on this DVD. Jose Carreras was astounding and Eva Marton and Peiro Cappuccilli were in top form for this nearly flawless opera.

For more than 3 decades I have owned and enjoyed my cassette tape boxed set of The Met production with Domingo, Scotto, Milnes and Levine. The music simply transports one to a higher plain. Finally, an Andrea Chenier worth watching on DVD! Thank you La Scala!",1307836800,4,870,4.958904109589041
654269,5,6303445578,"This performance is absolutely wonderful, although I confess that I prefer to LISTEN to it without WATCHING it.  The singers are top-notch, as is the orchestra.  But, it is something of a distraction to see Eva Marton cast as Maddalena, and Jose Carreras as her ""leading man.""  I don't mean to be cruel by this, but Jose is a little on the short side and Eva a little too large.  Plus, the stage props are somewhat distracting at times.  Thus, I just LISTEN to the wonderful music and performances on this DVD.  I should mention that Piero Cappuccilli is also great in this performance--his 2-minute audience ovation in Act III is evidence of this.",1263859200,7,648,4.640350877192983
654270,5,6303445578,"The pairing of Domingo and Sintov is most fitting, and I have great admiration of conductor Rudel--and this one is, I must say,

654271,3,6303445578,"I did watch ""andrea chenier"" on tv longtime ago and obviously it wasn't this one here. It was okay. Now in this year 2006 of our lord J.C,the first impression i had is that this piece of art need to be update(rework or an adaptation en francais s.v.p with subtitle in whatever language).Why??? How would you feel if you hear the ""star spangled banner"" being sung in another language that is not english? The french revolution looks like the glorification of hate and envy. Guillotine means ""suicide"" at first sight.
Forget about the singing it does not really matter when la liberte,l'egalite and l'amour are being falsified. Who cares?.. They should sing at least La marseillaise. My friends,we have cattle all around the world but you deal with the legend of the cow-boys in southwest usa and they don't speak swahili.
Ciao Giordano!!!Mama mia gonna miss you! I don't think so. After all he is the one who started and snobbery,my friends! That the bottom line. Is still going to be here. Worth watching??? Learning by experience..grr...grr...Boiling over;I'm out!..",1153008000,,1067,4.966480446927374
654272,5,6303445578,"I'm a huge Domingo fan, and own both his ""Chenier"" DVDs: the Covent Garden production with Tomowa-Sintov and the Vienna Opera production with Benackova.  Neither is ideal, with Domingo not at his best in one and the soprano a bust in the other.  I was beginning to think that a truly great ""Chenier"" might not exist -- until now.  This LaScala performance is nothing short of electryifying.  Most of the credit has to go to Carreras, who gives one of the finest performances I have ever seen, either in or out of an opera house.  Carreras' work has never really been on my radar (I know him mostly from The Three Tenors and his later career), so this interpretation was a surprise -- and a revelation.  Not only is the sound incredible, but his passion and commitment to every moment are simply extraordinary.  For his performance alone you should snatch up this DVD.  Luckily, there are other major compensations.  Marton, although a bit more Amazon than delicate young French girl, sings with equal passion and beauty, and her acting is superb.  (When was the last time you saw an opera singer shed actual tears?)  Cappuccilli, who gives a stunning performance on the Vienna DVD, is not quite as wonderful here.  This was a few years later, and the sound was a little drier, a little more patchy.  But he warms up considerably in Act 3, giving a solid, old-fashioned, powerhouse performance.  The crowd goes wild, with good reason.  (I do abhor his tendency, however, prevalent in the Vienna DVD as well, to milk the applause, smile at the audience and wink at the conductor.  Talk about old school!)  The production itself is lavish and very attractive, and it's all masterfully conducted by Riccardo Chailly.  Bottom line: If you can only afford one ""Chenier"" on DVD, this is the one to get, no ifs, ands or buts.  Sorry, Placido.",1142985600,68,1834,4.710691823899371
654273,5,6303445578,"It is going to be a long, a very long time indeed, before we see another Chenier to rival this fabulous 1985 Covent Garden performance. Domingo was in excellent voice, and he meets every vocal challenge with virile, golden tone. Even if he lacks that brilliant spinto of Corelli, he has what it takes for this formidable role. Of recent tenors none comes near. The rest of the cast is if anything, better. Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Karajan's favourite soprano is a glorious Maddalena: full voiced, warm, compelling, she is quite simply extraordinary. Baritone Giorgio Zancanaro gives a master class on how to mould a phrase in the old Italian style. His big aria is delivered with the kind of musicianship not heard since the days of Amato and Battistini.
Sound and picture are good and you would be completely insane to pass this dvd.",1075852800,42,829,4.804195804195804
654274,5,6303445578,"Umberto Giordano's most famous opera ""Andrea Chnier"" portrays the tragic fate of poet Andrea Chnier in the French Revolution. Setting the real-life figure as the lead character and with the poet singing his own verses, this verismo opera embraces the realism enthusiastically. Character Andrea Chnier is a romantic and idealistic poet, who loved his country ardently and faced his death heroically. It's a tenor's opera. You would think a lyric tenor would be most suitable for the character's poetry, if he could also bring off some great heroic moments in the big orchestration. In this 1985 production, Domingo rendered Andrea Chnier with a well-balanced poetry and heroism. He filled poet's big arias with rich lyricism, at times, intimate feelings, and yet, the big outbursts were all there. Domingo was well matched by the powerful-voiced Anna Tomawa-Sintov as Maddalena. In her dark and rounded voice, Anna Tomowa-Sintov sang the character strongly, although some delicacy and variety might make the role more interesting. Her ""La mamma morta"" was in no short of dramatic expressions in both the recitative-like passages and the emotional outbursts followed. Giorgio Zancanaro, who approached the revolutionary Grard humanly, sang a wonderful ""Nemico della patria"", which won him a storm of applause from the audience.
The stage design of this Covent Garden production is conventional, straightforward, with a few moments quite affecting, one of them would be the haunting picture at the end of Act I, in which the shadows of the poor and the angry gradually appeared above the aristocrats who were in the center stage, singing and dancing, without the faintest idea of what was awaiting.",1072483200,41,1695,5.304832713754647
654275,5,6303445578,"Until recently (November 2003) the only DVD edition of Andrea Chenier was a 1975 film version with Franco Corelli in the title role.  This one is much better.  It is an excellent live production filmed at Covent Garden in 1985.  It illustrates why the Royal Opera is one of the world's leading companies.
The three principals -- Placido Domingo as Chenier, Anna Tomowa-Sintow as Maddalena de Coigny, and Giorgio Zancanaro as Carlo Gerard -- are all in the prime of their careers at the time of this filming, and handle their roles superbly.  They are backed up by a solid group of supporting singers.  The orchestra does justice to Giordano's rich score without ever drowning out the singers.  The sets and costumes are appropriate and never distracting.  In short, this is exactly what one would expect to see in a first-rate production at a first-rate opera house.",1070064000,47,866,4.850340136054422

7847826,5,6303445578,I always enjoy Domingo and this was no exception.  But this opera belongs to Gerard.  And Zancanaro is superb.  Don't miss it.  ~ Celeste Downey,1470528000,,144,4.64

7847828,4,6303445578,"My only disappointment with this production is that the production values seem a little undercooked (the sets for Acts II through IV are virtually the same, admirable economy of design but a bit boring to look at for two hours) and some of the smaller supporting roles are blandly sung (with the exception of Cynthia Buchan who gives one of the most spirited Bersi arias I've heard).  Giorgio Zancanaro makes a strong case for this opera being renamed ""Carlo Gerard,"" as Gerard (one of opera's few bad-guys-turned-good) is simply a more interesting character than either of the two leads and Zancanaro's brilliant performance pushes it over the top.  I also share the disapproval and disappointment that his final bow was omitted from the DVD - what was Kultur thinking??  Domingo and Tomowa-Sintow are fine, although she doesn't really make an impression until Act III ""La mamma morta.""",1430611200,,887,5.020408163265306

7847830,5,6303445578,"Plcido is not in the best of voice on this wonderful production of Chnier but as usual he acts magnificently. The star, by a long way, is Giorgio Zancanaro as Grard. He is commanding throughout and the DVD is worth the price just to see him. His aria just before the tribunal takes place  (Nemico della patria?) brought the house down. It is interesting that the DVD, unlike the video, omits the ovation for Zancanaro at the production's end. Was it too embarrassing for a baritone to gt more applause than the tenor and soprano?

A superb version that never lightens on its suspense. A tremendous achievement by the Royal Opera House.",1407024000,2,635,4.660714285714286
