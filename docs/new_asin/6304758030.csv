937116,4,6304758030,"Borderline, 1950 film

The film begins at a tall building at dusk. The US Treasury Department has two prisoners arrested for transporting narcotics. The man won't talk, the woman will cooperate. How does Pete Ritchie operate? Can they use a woman for undercover work? In Mexico six singing girls put on their act! Does it cross the borderline? Will Pete's henchman drink too much? Will Madeline Haley be able to gather information? John Maclin shows up to grab information on a boat shipment. A man is forced to talk. There is a dramatic shooting!

There is a plan to send a shipment north using Gladys LaRue as a ""wife"". The drugs are hidden in a false bottom and will go to the Los Angeles Zoo. A hidden camera records the shipment. Maclin sends a telegram with a hidden message; he has a secret! There is humor in the hotel room. But a warning sends them scurrying away. A farm cart blocks the road. Is it a trap? Shots are fired. Maclin comes up with an excuse for speeding, there a clever substitution! But they have to ditch their car. [Humor breaks the tension, but distracts from the seriousness of this story.]

They find a pilot to fly them to Ensenada. But there is a problem and they land on a beach. We learn more about the operation. There is a surprise for Maclin. Then a trap for Ritchie. There is another surprise at the Customs Office! They continue to the Los Angeles Zoo to make delivery. They meet at the Big Boss' place. The police raid the house and catch them all. A happy ending.
A film like this never asks about the social culture that creates a demand for narcotics.",1263513600,,1594,4.470790378006873

937118,3,6304758030,"This film was mentioned in a documentary about noir films, so I was looking forward to the stark lighting, pessimistic and violent story line, cynical men and sultry women.  Unfortunately this was a romantic comedy along the lines of a Doris Day 50's film.

The story barely holds together about a woman (Claire Trevor) working for LAPD who goes undercover in Mexico and ends up traveling with Fred MacMurray who plays a drug dealer. The head drug dealer (Raymond Burr) is after them and there are chases and hi-jinks through the Mexican countryside.

After a while I lost track of the plot and realized that the story only served to put MacMurray and Trevor in as many romantic situations as possible.  MacMurray was pretty sexy and played a bad guy and a romantic lead with his usual expertise.  Trevor was a good comedic actress, she reminded me a lot of Lucille Ball.  Burr burned up the screen whenever he appeared--a wonderful intense actor.

Overall, not my cup of tea.  I would give it two stars except I think the actors did a really good job; they held together an otherwise poorly constructed film.",1157328000,2,1109,4.709844559585492
937119,3,6304758030,"""Borderline"" doesn't know what it wants to be....it's a collision of genres, comedy and police drama with the lighter side dominating. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I didn't once look at my watch. The humorous lines are genuinely funny especially from Claire Trevor. There are little nuances that add so much to a scene. Without delivering a spoiler, there's a scene where MacMurray and Trevor are at the house of the local sheriff. The bit with the sheriff's daughter lends a nice touch of humor to an otherwise functional scene. There are a lot of these nuances either in action or dialogue throughout the movie. I would say that if you are looking for a good crime drama from this era, you might be disappointed. If however you go into the movie knowing it's not typical of the genre, you should be able to meet it on its own terms and have fun. I do recommend this film.",1147737600,4,895,4.565217391304348

That's Fred MacMurray, talking to Claire Trevor as they are speeding down a dirt road in Mexico with a parrot cage full of drugs. They are both narcotics agents, but neither realizes this about the other. Oops, here's a wagon full of hay blocking the road; that balky donkey won't go. And, wow, it just got worse: the bad guys have just arrived. Lucky that Claire has that cigarette lighter!

It's fast-paced action, clever dialogue, silly situations and innocent romance between the two talented principals as they try to get back to the border. You will watch this movie over and over, and lend it to your buddies to enjoy. Treat yourself to some fun!",1142985600,9,728,4.557251908396947
937121,5,6304758030,"This fun and funny crime caper has a great cast and lots of south-of-the-border flavor that makes it an entertaining 88 minutes at the movies. William A. Seiter's Borderline is a nifty little film that has more in common with The Big Steal than the noir film it is often advertised as. It is a blend of humor, crime and fun that grows on you more and more until its snappy ending.

It seems both the L.A.P.D. and United States Treasury Customs wants to stop a dope smuggling ring bringing narcotics across the border from Mexico. Claire Trevor is the enthusiastic if green L.A. cop Madeline Haley, a former O.S.S. agent who talks her way into the assignment of going down south in an attempt to get information on the nasty middleman Pete Ritche, hoping it will lead them to Mr. Big. TV's Perry Mason, Raymond Burr, is the heavy in the white suit, Ritche, and plays the role with menace.

Madeline sort of stumbles into Ritchie but before she can find anything out, Johnny Mackland, an unknown player working for the L.A. end of the connection, hijacks Ritchie's gold so he can make a deal for the next shipment. He ends up taking Madeline with him after the guns are drawn and the chase is on.

The chase across Mexico, as they try to avoid Ritchie and elude the cops is a lot of fun. Madeline and Johnny start telling each other tall tales and warming up to each other along the way. When Johnny's pal Miguel gets shot they have a body on their hands to deal with, complicating the chase even more. Fred MacMurray is good as Johnny, the cop who doesn't know Madeline is a cop, who doesn't know he's a cop!

Sort of a fun pulp film with more flavor than a habanero pepper, Trevor gives a cute performance as she begins to like Johnny, even getting a bit jealous of the oh so friendly young and pretty daughter of a not too smart Mexican cop. He unknowingly helps them garner a plane to Encinada for the big deal. As the two near the border, each regrets having to turn the other one in because they've fallen for each other.

Once they get straightened out on just who works for who, a rousing shoot-out with Ritchie and his gang climaxes a great ending to this very fun to watch film. A film that's meant as entertainment, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Fans of genre films like this will enjoy going south of the border with this one.",1123200000,9,2368,4.409610983981693
937122,4,6304758030,"Borderline is a fun, early 50s crime drama, played with some humor.  The chase across Mexico plotline is similar to Robert Mitchum's The Big Steal.

In addition to moving along nicely, Borderline has three other special qualities.  First, as always, Claire Trevor is great.  Second, you get to see Fred McMurray and Raymond Burr play bad guys and third, this seems to be one of the only oldies.com DVDs with good quality.",1113091200,16,421,4.805555555555555
937123,4,6304758030,"Madeleine Haley (Claire Trevor) is an ambitious member of the Los Angeles Police Department.  When the chief calls for a ""tawdry dame"" to infiltrate Pete Ritchie's (Raymond Burr) drug trafficking operations she pushes her way through a wall of male shoulders and lands the assignment.
 Ritchie operates out of Mexico, and Madeleine contrives to throw herself at him until she sticks.  Before she has a chance to let out a breath and settle into moll-dom Johnny McEvoy (Fred MacMurray) breaks in on the scene, manages to find out when ""the stuff"" is hitting the docks, and kidnaps Madeleine, presumably for insurance against the wrath of Ritchie.
Without giving anything away, McEvoy has a few secrets of his own, which he is able to keep from Madeleine but which the viewer is privy to early on.  After Madeleine's abduction this becomes a chase movie.  McEvoy and Madeleine drive north, away from Ritchie and towards customers for their ""stuff.""  Of course, Madeleine intends to turn McEvoy over to the authorities as soon as they hit the border, so she'd better not fall for him.
 MacMurray and Trevor have good chemistry together.  A few of their scenes sparkle, and they're convincing as people who are trying not to believe the worst of each other.  Raymond Burr is excellently sinister as the white suited bad guy.  This is one menacing dude.
 I've tried to understand why this one is so obscure.  Good cast, nifty mistaken identity issues, interesting minor characters.  BORDERLINE has a lot going for it, and I'll bet you not one in a hundred film buffs have ever heard of it, much less seen it.
 Maybe it's because it doesn't quite know what it wants to be - it's kind of film noir, kind of a chase flick, kind of a light romantic comedy.  Burr's character is menacing enough, but the director (William A. Seiter) never takes it to the next step.  The scenes where MacMurray and Trevor are threatened by him are defused too quickly.  Burr's last scene feels like the end of the movie, and it's an anti-climatic one, at that.  By then the real danger is past.  Maybe if the MacMurray character had been given a hard, inaccessible inner core (like Walter Neff in DOUBLE INDEMNITY, for example) we wouldn't find this one in the bargain bin at the used book store.
 If not terribly memorable, BORDERLINE is entertaining enough.  The cast is much better than the material they've been given.",1082851200,3,2395,4.764563106796117

MacMurray proves he can play any kind of role. Trevor seems out of place and wrong for the part. Raymond Burr plays a heavy in more ways than one. Also in the cast are: Jose Torvay, Roy Roberts and Don Diamond.
I would add to this that if you want great film noir with Clair Trevor then check out ""Key Largo""; as for Fred Mac Murray, ""Double Indemnity.""",1066262400,6,615,4.4035087719298245

Directed by William A. Seiter

Customs agents are looking for information about Pete Ritchie (Raymond Burr), who is involved in smuggling drugs from Mexico into the US. Police officer Madeleine Haley (Claire Trevor) goes undercover in order to gain Ritchie's confidence, and before long she meets him through one of his associates. As she is talking with Ritchie, another undercover agent, Johnny Macklin (Fred MacMurray) and one of his men burst in, and they provoke a violent confrontation. From then on, Haley is in constant danger as she attempts to figure out everything that is happening in the smuggling operation.

An odd blend of crime melodrama with humorous undertones

7878880,5,6304758030,"BORDERLINE (1950) is a black and white movie taking place in Mexico and, at the opening minutes and closing minutes, in Los Angeles.  The movie concerns efforts by the L.A. police department to hunt down and capture heroin smugglers.  Claire Trevor plays a police detective with the mission of pretending that she is a floozy.  The storyline concerns two competing gangs involved in heroin smuggling.  One gang is led by Raymond Burr, while a competing gang is led by Fred MacMurray.  MacMurray's gang appears to be a 1-man operation.

Fred MacMurray is beloved by all baby-boomers, because of his roles in Shaggy Dog (1959), Absent Minded Professor (1961), and Son of Flubber (1963).  However, what I learned a few years ago is that there is a darker side to Fred MacMurray, where he plays sleazy characters, as in THE APARTMENT (1960), and as in BORDERLINE (1950).  Claire Trevor won an Academy Award for Key Largo, and she has starred in 60 movies.  Raymond Burr is also admired by baby-boomers, because of his role in Perry Mason.

Although the movie seems not to have involved any great expense, because of lack of large crowd scenes and because of absence of large props such as submarines or battleships, the movie more than makes up for its lack of expense because of its clever storyline and variety of colorful scenes in Mexican villages.  Much of the film takes the form of a cat and mouse chase, where Raymond Burr's gang is chasing after Fred MacMurray.  This chase is for the reason that MacMurray is carrying a parrot cage where the bottom contains heroin, and also carrying a music box, where the false bottom also contains heroin.  The chase scenes involve pushing an automobile off the road into a ravine to hide it, getting help from a friendly chubby Mexican who turns out to be the sheriff, and getting a ride on a 2-seater airplane which runs out of fuel and is forced to land on a beach in Mexico.  Near the beginning of the story, actress Claire Trevor agrees to join Fred MacMurray.  MacMurray wants her to pretend that she is his wife, in order to reduce any suspicions during the border crossing into the United States, while Claire Trevor wants to tag along so that she can turn him over to the police once they cross the border.

NO SPOILER HERE.  Borderline has a very clever ironic ending, which is on par with the most of clever of endings from the black and white Twilight Zone series.  To put things into perspective, I have seen only one other movie in my entire life with an ending as clever and ironic as the best of the Twilight Zone endings, and this is THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE (2003), which has not one but two consecutive ironic endings.  And so, I am not going to give away the great ironic ending of BORDERLINE.

FILM NOIR.  I have recently developed an interest in ""film noir"" movies. (My reason, is that I wanted to find examples of ""film noir"" music that contained jazzy piano music.  In the past couple of months, I have discovered the following absolutely excellent black and white movies.  While BORDERLINE is never dull, never forced, and always engaging and unpredictable, I would not really place BORDERLINE in the same upper echelon class as the following movies:
(1) THE TRAIN (1964).  This WWII movie, taking place in France, stars Burt Lancaster as the engineer of a train, with the goal of preventing the Nazis from stealing priceless French paintings.  The film dwells lovingly on the machinery of trains, and the camera provides a gloriously detailed cinematography of a train wreck.
(2) GARMENT JUNGLE (1957).  This treasure of a film stars Lee J. Cobb as the owner of a garment company in lower Manhattan.  The issue is whether the company should accept the union, or whether the company should continue to give money to thugs to prevent unionization.  Richard Boone (Paladin) and Kerwin Mathews (7th Voyage of Sinbad) star in this clever and fast-moving film.
(3) YOUNG SAVAGES (1961) stars Burt Lancaster.  The movie features a gang of three teenaged thugs called The Thunderbirds, and the leader of this gang is played by John Davis Chandler.  John Davis Chandler plays a mentally deranged neurotic thug, and in his other movies, he plays similar characters.  In my opinion, YOUNG SAVAGES should be one of the most famous and revered of American movies, but for reasons unknown, it seems to have avoided being on most peoples' radar screen.
(4) D.O.A. (1950) is another film noir movie, but it is not a really great one  --  it is about in the same class as BORDERLINE.  D.O.A. takes place mainly in San Francisco, and it stars Edmund O'Brien as the man who solved his own murder.",1482278400,,4643,4.705445544554456
7878881,3,6304758030,"As long as people love their dope, their marijuana, guys will try to move heaven and earth to bring the produce to their doors. (Although with recent liberalized and decriminalized efforts to take that particular drug out of shadow economy in some states there will presumably be less aura of criminal lure about the thing). That is the presumption behind this 1950 film noir with a twist Borderline (the twist being some funny scenes that don't normally make sense in a noir, seem like a send-up of serious noir like The Big Sleep and Out Of The Past where nobody is laughing-except grimly grinding their teeth).

The plot otherwise (a B-film plot in any case) is pretty conventional for this kind of off-beat police procedural. The people want their dope, it is illegal, and guys will take great risks and great profits to satisfy that market down in sunny Mexico where the stuff was produced in huge quantities. Still is. So a guy like Pete Ritchie, played by Raymond Burr last seen as Perry Mason-a good guy lawyer-but here as a low down dope dealer, will go to any lengths to keep the profits flowing south and the product flowing north. And of course various local, state and federal law enforcement agencies want to rain on guys like Ritchies parade. But drug lords don't get to be drug lords without a serious security system and the coppers are stymied until they can get agents working on the inside-presuming that they can keep out of each others way.

That last remark applies double here since two agencies try to get inside Petes operation at the same time. One, Johnny, played by Fred MacMurry last seen here sweating out a gunshot wound after playing with fire, playing with a deadly femme in Double Indemnity and the other Madeleine, played by Claire Trevor last seen in these precincts putting a few slugs in Moose Malloy in the classic Murder, My Sweet (Farewell, My Lovely when Raymond Chandler wrote the crime novel). Neither know that the other is a drug agent working to get dear Pete off the streets and into the nearest cell. They go through their paces, through their comedy of errors as both try to get the other (and the dope) to the border for the collar. Along the way a lot of goofy stuff happens and a lot of danger but they see it through. Oh yeah and like in any such story they fall for each other not knowing that the other shoe is going to drop on one of them. Not to worry old Pete gets snagged in Mexico and the kingpin of the whole operation gets bagged in L.A. and the dope agents go about their love business.
