8225393,1,B000WS4S9O,"""Bikini Bloodbath Shakespeare"" (Actual credit: ""Written by William Shakespeare; Directed and Adapted by John Reed"") is an absolutely atrocious ""movie"" which opens with a very Shakespearean girl's volleyball game and goes downhill from there. It's barely an hour long, but I have no doubt that you will find, as I did, that the running time is excessive. Highlights include music by ""White Liger,"" death among plastic pink flamingoes and a killer whale snow globe (surely this must hark back to ""King Lear,"") and an apparent tribute to Kenny Loggins' classic ""Footloose."" Before it's over you can find out why the quality of mercy is unstrained (oh, please,) and you will likely be wishing everyone could have fallen on their bare bodkins at the outset rendering it unnecessary for anyone to have to view this travesty.

The dubbing and sound quality are worthy of singling out for special scorn: many of the ostensibly hilarious lines are nearly inaudible, and sound levels are all over the place. Whether missing some of the precious dialogue detracts from the viewing experience or not is worthy of debate (I vote no,) but I will say that even after buying a movie with this title (I was not expecting a lot) and having seen thousands of genuinely awful films, this one is in the highest echelon of wretched cinema. You have been forewarned: a lost classic of the Bard's it most certainly is not.",1381795200,,1398,4.873949579831932
8225394,2,B000WS4S9O,"This is, must be a lousy home movie. The sound is so garbled that it is difficult for a senior to understand a word. I do  not believe there is anything relevant to WilliamShakespeare in it. I am hearing impaired. Shakespeare spoke modern English. He wrote in the same English that is in currency today. The many, many words in Shakespeare's time are out of favor today. But his English exists in dictionaries. Be sure of that. Thousands of words in Shakespeare's England, circa the 1600s are very much floating around today. It was how they were framed that makes for confusion.

The acting is below 3rd rate. The cast has no talent whatsoever. It s really a lousy movie.

One of the characters with the football players was in the local Subway sandwich shop I believe the other day. This was on the UWS of Manhattan, south of 116th Street. Show business stinks and are partly responsible for the those 911 (police emergency telephone #) deaths at the WorldTradeCenter. The Slime are trying to save their careers. The ol' show business remorseful expression-touching.

Not one in the cast, I assume has one iota of athletic ability. This movie stinks.

The only good thing was the shower scene were I saw a fair headed girl with nice knockers that had not wrestled with the sagging ravages of time.

This movie is not worth buying.

There is no voice over in Shakespeare's English either. Nothing is sub-titled.

Clever it ain't. They misrepresented.

Of course I did not watch the whole thing. The knockers is/are its only virtue and attraction.",1361404800,2,1547,4.742537313432836
8225395,1,B000WS4S9O,"One or two seconds of semi-nudity 80 minutes of stupidity. There is a lot of really fake looking blood(corn syrup)and no gore. Come on!!!!... in this day and age where's the gore,save that for Hershell Gorden Lewis and the rest of the old campy splatter fest when they had less to work with and did at least have good gore amounts! I was duped into this purchase by the cover which looks good and that's about it.[...].  There's not much going on in this flim if u can call it that. Looks like my drunk uncles camera work at our family reunion barbecue. Some of the people that are in this, look as if the're trying to hold back from giggling and staring into the camera lens. [...]  I only spend time to write this because of the anger toward myself for buying and the people who distributed this dung. Hopefully I can save u from purchasing this waste of time and money. It's not one of those so bad its good movies. I usually really like trash that's entertaining. There isn't one damn thing to like here. Do yourself a favor and don't spend any time on this, keep your money and go out for pizza.",1213488000,15,1100,4.309178743961352
8225396,2,B000WS4S9O,"How can you go wrong with a movie called Bikini Bloodbath?  Just ask the guys responsible for this movie.  Despite seemingly covering all of the essential Bs (blood, babes, bikinis, and booze), Blood Bath Pictures pretty much laid an egg with this one.  Yes, it does have a few funny moments, but overall this film proves more annoying than entertaining.  I have enjoyed a few horror comedy spoofs in my time, but Bikini Bloodbath just isn't one of them.  It's too gimmicky, too dumb, and too short - the film itself is barely an hour, with an insufferable music video and some bloopers tacked on after that.  Speaking of music, it's pretty rough going on several occasions.  80s music is the best, but bad 80s music is the worst, and this film is dripping with the latter.  You will hear a few tunes you recognize, such as Footloose, but the lyrics and song titles themselves have been rewritten specifically for this film - that's a good thing because trying to understand the words can momentarily distract you from thinking about just how awful this film is.

I daresay there's not a B-movie horror fan who is unfamiliar with the work of Debbie Rochon, which is probably why she gets top billing here, despite the fact that her role (as a high school gym teacher with an eye for the young ladies) is actually a rather minor one.  That leaves it up to all of the younger actresses to carry the load, and only a couple of them prove themselves up to the task.  Let me just say that Bikini Blood Bath is not a showcase for great acting and leave it at that.

Ah yes, the plot.  After a spirited game of volleyball and a shower in the girls' locker room, both of which featured plenty of insults to Smelly Suzy, the girls plan a slumber party at Jenny's (Leah Ford) house.  Not to be outdone, the football players (we know they're football players because all of them are wearing T-shirts saying ""Football Player"") plan a party of their own.  Sure, there's a murderer on the loose in the area, but no one seems overly concerned about that - with the obvious exception of the couple of people we see murdered by The Chef (we know he's ""The Chef"" because - aw, forget it).  As the girls finally don those bikinis the title promised and head out to the hot tub, the guys' party becomes such a grab-ass affair that a couple of them bail and head out for the girls' house.  The guys they leave behind should really be playing powder-puff football rather than real football, if you know what I mean - I may never look at a game of Twister the same way again.  Finally, The Chef (Robert Cosgrove, Jr.) turns up and starts mouthing stupid culinary catch phrases as he picks the characters off one by one (starting with the hottest of the girls - the cad).  Trapped inside the house with no phone service, the girls do the only thing they can do - indulge in strawberry daiquiris.

Bikini Blood Bath is every bit the slasher spoof, so you pretty much know to expect a really stupid story - and that is exactly what you get.  Don't expect to see a lot of gore, despite the title's reference to a bloodbath.  Do expect to see reasonably attractive young women in bikinis, plenty of old-school juvenile humor, and a lot of bad acting.  More often than not, that kind of combination entertains me, but there's just some sort of vacuous quality to this film that left me nonplussed.  Some will no doubt find the movie much funnier than I did.",1205107200,7,3428,4.456730769230769
8225397,4,B000WS4S9O,"Bikini Bloodbath reminded of those ridiculous comedies from when I was young like Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane, or another lower budget Leslie Nielsen flick.

It's absurd; a uniquely quirky genre flick that's definitely worth the watch.  There's a Flashdance sequence that's pretty amazing and it seems like the writers put in enough movie references that everyone will get at least a few.",1197849600,6,391,5.290322580645161
8225398,5,B000WS4S9O,Debbie Rochon stars in this ridiculous indy film release.  The rating on the box is B for Boobs Blood and Bad Words.  I think that says it all.  Film Threat says it's 'Brainless Fun' and that's exactly right.  It's a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.,1196208000,11,266,4.479166666666667
