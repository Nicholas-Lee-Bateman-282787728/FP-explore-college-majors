8394790,4,B003DICUYU,"This film does a good job covering the vibrancy and history of Maxwell Street.  It is also an advocacy piece for more stringent zoning and more thoughtful redevelopment, which, even if you are of like mind, may come off heavy-handed.  Despite this, the subject itself is deserving of a film, and this one covers its facets quite well.",1501977600,,334,4.741379310344827

8394792,5,B003DICUYU,A true work of art!  Great story of Chicago's historic Maxwell Street.  Really enjoyed the film.,1494547200,,96,4.9375
8394793,1,B003DICUYU,"I found this a choppy, ill-coordinated film whose modest description of the Maxwell Street I knew during the late thirties and all through the forties  inadequate at best. My grandfather worked as a clothing salesman on Maxwell Street from his arrival in America in 1907 until his death in 1956, and the street and people he knew and worked with, and with whom I frequently visited, were woefully under-represented. Mixing the history of the market with the Chicago blues scene impressed me as a curious admixture. Music was at best a modest part of Maxwell Street in its heyday. The film is weighted heaviest on the late days and character of the street, which by then had lost its greatest vitality.",1490486400,,701,4.793388429752066
8394794,5,B003DICUYU,A masterpiece!  We enjoyed it as much the second time we watched as the first. It took us inside the heart and soul of the people who have come to Chicago looking for a better life and how they came together in this amazing outdoor marketplace.,1462838400,2,244,4.304347826086956
8394795,5,B003DICUYU,I used to visit MS as a teenager and it was a special place for me where I learned how to bargain and learned about Chicago and its great and diverse people. For many there was a deep sadness to see this part of the city taken and fade away without even a decent memorial or effort to keep it alive. This movie captures all of those emotions.  See the movie if you were ever there or you want to learn about how MS was an important  part of the melting pot and Blues scene that Chicago was and still is.,1418428800,2,503,3.9702970297029703
8394796,3,B003DICUYU,"Hoping for more information on venders, life of residences, and a where are they now/up close and personal interview with personalities who may still be alive or their family members.",1383955200,,183,5.133333333333334
8394797,5,B003DICUYU,"This is one terrific documentary which features the last interview of Bo Diddley about Maxwell Street-one of the handful of alltime great legendary streets,which should still be at its peak. Joe Mantegna does a great job narrating its history,which I first came across with Ira Berkow's classic 'Maxwell Street' which is a book of interviews and stories of the incredible people who came from the area,including the late,great Nate Duncan;In this documentary,Duncan  discusses how Chicago and The University of Chicago-Illinois ruined it. He  bought Lyon's Deli from Ben Lyons-and is a prime example  of the relationships between blacks,Jews and people of all backgrounds who did business here. Going to Maxwell Street after reading Berkow's book in Detroit-was sort of a religious experience for me which is reflected in 'Cheat You Fair'.",1358553600,2,839,5.3893129770992365
8394798,5,B003DICUYU,"After much anticipation, Cheat You Fair, the incredibly moving and ultimately heartbreaking story of Chicago's famed Maxwell Street Market is finally available on DVD. Written, directed and produced by Phil Ranstrom and narrated by actor and former Maxwell Street regular Joe Mantegna, the film meticulously documents the street's fascinating 120-year history from its humble beginnings as a makeshift refuge for poor immigrants in the years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 to its heydey as being one of the most unique and culturally important open-air markets of the 20th century to the valiant but unsuccessful efforts in the early 1990s to save it from both the city and a nearby university's destructive plans of gentrification which eventually displaced countless families and livelihoods.

Most fans of Chicago blues recognize the dominant role Maxwell Street played in the music's creation and Cheat You Fair prominently features many bluesmen and women who famously performed on the hallowed grounds near Maxwell and Halsted throughout the years. Artists such as Jimmie Lee Robinson, Eddie Burks, Uncle Johnnie Williams, Johnnie Mae Dunson, Bo Diddley and Junior Wells among others offer their perspectives on why the street was so important to themselves and to so many others.

From start to finish, the film wonderfully captures not only the spirit of Maxwell Street and its vibrant people, but also its cultural and historical significance. With top-notch production, the amount of rare historical photographs and film clips of Maxwell Street that Ranstrom has unearthed to help visually tell the story is staggering. This, along with Ranstrom's own footage and interviews which he began shooting in 1994 to document Maxwell's remaining days, combine to paint a complete and very engaging history of this one-of-a-kind landmark.

Cheat You Fair is a powerful film which I cannot recommend highly enough.",1306454400,18,1925,5.431438127090301
