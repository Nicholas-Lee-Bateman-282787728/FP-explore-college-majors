1880163,4,B000096I9U,"Two movies for the price of one, how great is this. On one hand you have a sexually supressed british historical flik on the other side you have an italian soft porno with bondage, homoeroticism, and a bit of comedy. I didn't know whether to laugh or be in horror. All in all to me it was fun so 4 stars.",1409270400,,304,4.0
1880164,5,B000096I9U,"I originally caught a screening of this film on TV back in the early 70's. What i originally saw (with my dad watching as well) was a highly edited version. My father even claimed it was a 'good' film, though his taste ran from war dramas to westerns, he mentioned the music was rather 'lush' for the type of film it was, and the acting was very good.
I on the other hand can add more praises.
Over the years I have searched for this film, to no avail,  but didn't know it bore another title. On TV, it was called 'Night Of The Blood Monster', which was rather a poor choice in my opinion. As i researched years later,  distributor American International Pictures opted for such a title to sensationalize, or exploit it's subject matter. So, recently I found 'The Bloody Judge' ('Night Of The Blood Monster') as what i have been searching for all these years.
I watched the extras first, to give me more insight on the film before actually watching it. Though they do contain 'spoilers' to those who have not seen the film yet, they do explain that the film was really not considered a 'horror' film when made, but as based on fact and more of a historical drama about George Jeffreys with some violence thrown in. I do agree with that.
Also, was financed by no less than 3 countries. I can just see the Director's face at times when so many producers were putting their 2 cents in on how certain scenes were to be filmed. That, is also explained in the extras.
Of course there are omissions that the script could have utilized, like the fact that Jeffreys had a son, John, who wasn't even mentioned in the film. But running time of almost 2 hours would have made that inclusion impossible as Christopher Lee's character was the main focus.
Christopher Lee, a man who has made more appearances on film than probably any other actor, gives more than fine performance. Some may call it 'over the top', but his attitude throughout the film played true to the character he was playing, as Jeffreys was sort of an alcoholic, as he was having kidney failure and the doctors suggested alcohol to subdue the pain. A rather bad choice, but it was 1689.
The print here is magnificent. In order to give the viewer the full experience, the best print possible was utilized, including scenes that were scissored out, as in some parts of the world, and this is 1972, could not show specific scenes that were shot (lesbianism, butchery, etc.). So what we have here is the best possible version utilizing all materials that survived all these years.
The sound quality and picture may be a little quirky at times (towards the end) as the scenes that were cut out that are now restored were from other parts of the world (Spain, Germany) and are subtitled. But these inclusions do not distract from the flow of the film.
If you are looking for another 'Mark Of The Devil', or 'The Conqueror Worm', you may be disappointed if you are looking for alot of violence.
But, if you are looking for a good historical film, with good acting, with some violence and a little nudity, and a handsome print to boot, this is a must see. And the price is rather affordable, and quite worth it for what you get.",1403395200,3,3177,4.494809688581315
1880165,1,B000096I9U,"I was accutely dissapointed.  The acting was dreadful, the plot was shallow and it really was a form of early soft porn with an equally bad soundtrack.",1403049600,4,151,4.592592592592593
1880166,5,B000096I9U,"One of the most interesting and entertaining of Christopher Lee films, which has decent acting, sets, and dialog. This is not a Hammer Film production. The film is presented in widescreen with very good picture and sound.",1386201600,2,221,5.0
1880167,4,B000096I9U,"The Bloody Judge stars Christopher Lee as the corrupt Lord Jeffreys in a corrupt society, with his court sending anyone it pleases to torture and eventual death. Most notably sending a young Alicia to death after being charged as a wicked witch, even with an obvious lack of evidence. Later, the sister of Alicia, Mary, is caught up in conflict of interest as she is the lover to the son of a political enemy of Jefferys.

Yet all this doesn't really matter, most of this movie is combination of full nudity for the female cast and/or torture scenes for the female cast. While the nudity is nice I suppose considering the cast they have, the torture scenes are largely unneeded considering how awkwardly they are executed. Mostly it's just one of the female characters being tortured in some excessive yet obviously fake way, while they are covered in fake blood, and then have them scream a lot. However if there happens to be no nudity or torture on the screen, one can always rely on this film to deliver the wonderfully hammy acting to give some great laughs.

One could find this movie pretty easily on the cheap and have some laughs and enjoyment out of it, it may not be very memorable, but you shouldn't regret it.",1364256000,2,1222,4.60091743119266
1880168,5,B000096I9U,"I really enjoyed this film. Lee gives one of his best performances. He is the main reason to get the film. He and Franco did a great job on this film. There is gratuitous sex but by this time in his career Franco would ussually stick in sex just to make the project more profitable and to help get distribution.
Overall fun cinema and a good example of Eurohorror.",1354752000,,364,4.2898550724637685
1880169,5,B000096I9U,"By this time franco was making movies with plots , gone are the lsd inspired early 70's plotless type of flicks, this one instead is a straight story from the past that is similiar to 'witchfinder general'. Blue Underground which always does things right put together this fine film from several existing edits and came out with the best looking and edited version of the film possible. This one is about a sadistic judge who wreaks havoc on the people of his time. the 1600's or some such era. Christopher lee is of course excellent and this one is a must for horror fans. ALthough the horror is from the actions of the judge and not some nonhuman monster.",1324944000,2,657,4.529411764705882
1880170,5,B000096I9U,"Christopher Lee is tremendously effective as the pompous, sadistic, and perverse Judge George Jeffries. Lee and director, Jess Franco battled over the way in which Jeffries should be presented -Lee wanting a more historically accurate approach, while Franco (of course) wanted a more salacious portrayal. Both sides won! In THE BLOODY JUDGE, Lee is able to play it fairly straight, unaware of the twisted, gory, and somewhat demented touches that Franco would add later! The finished product is a historical drama w/ nudity, blood, and torture! Mr. Lee has refused to watch the film, not being a fan of anything graphic or gratuitous. Maria Rohm is stunningly beautiful and makes the perfect object of Jeffries' carnal desires. Howard Vernon is also good as the torturer-in-chief! Great stuff!...",1308268800,2,796,5.275590551181103
1880171,4,B000096I9U,"A great improvement on the earlier 94 minute video. Blue underground have produced a version of this film that is both of excellent quality and quantity,approximately 10 minutes extra. As for the film itself Franco fans should not be disappointed. The battle scenes are somewhat tedious but Maria Rohm's exploits more than make up for that slight criticism. Anyone who has Witchfinder General or Mark of the Devil in their collection should certainly buy this.",1120780800,10,460,5.1466666666666665
1880172,4,B000096I9U,"This is an amazing movie. It's basically an exploitation movie with the production values of an historical drama. The acting is outstanding, particularly Christopher Lee and Maria Rohm. Blue Underground have scraped together a magnificent print, taking elements from the various released and unreleased versions of the movie to produced an excellent film that's never existed in this form before. Given the patchwork history it seems like the movie should be a mess, but it all hangs together very well. The inclusion of alternate versions of some scenes in the extras department is very educational. The interview segments from this and the other Blue Underground released of Jess Franco/Harry Alan Towers collaborations could probably be edited into a great feature-length documentary.

Speaking of which, Blue Underground have now released all the Franco/Towers movies except for Count Dracula. I hope that's on the drawing board for the not-too-distant future!",1109116800,18,964,5.513513513513513

1880220,2,B000096I9U,I really didn't find this movie scary if that's what it was supposed to be but did find it kind of hard to follow due to accents and the story line itself.

7989935,1,B000096I9U,Many movies like this were made during this time. Roger Cormans' Witchfinder General is a good example. The most notorious is Ken Russells' The Devils. Michael Caine in The Last Valley. Currently there is Eddie Redmayne and Sean Bean in Black Death on prime.
