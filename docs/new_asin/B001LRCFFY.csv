8319546,5,B001LRCFFY,"I gave this 5 stars even though I have never read it. I took Marc Carder's online course, which is completely free, and in my opinion, much easier to learn from than from reading a book. Marc is a gifted artist and a just as gifted teacher. I love his videos, which are long, and detailed. I had never picked up a paintbrush in my life, and my first painting using his method blew me away. I showed it to my family and they were absolutely stunned. Marc believes that anyone--and he means ANYONE--can learn to paint, and to paint well; that it doesn't take some inborn gift. His videos have proved it to me. He is a person of generosity, talent and vision. I have also purchased his line of Geneva paints, which are incredible--I'll never use anything else! So my recommendation is go watch his videos on YouTube--every single one of them. Then pick up a brush and paint something amazing, as you surely will (as long as you follow the method he teaches!)",1462060800,3,955,4.431818181818182
8319547,5,B001LRCFFY,"You can now buy this from the website.  Some of the information on the DVD's is on you tube also.  About the product, this is a very comprehensive art course.  I would liken it what you would get in earning your Master of Fine Art degree.  This comes from my sister who has her MFA and suggested I get these DVD's as that she stated these were better than what she learned at art school.  Mark Carder is a successful self taught artist.  In these lessons he has distilling what he has learned.  His portraits start as on 5/2014 at $30,000.  He style is very photo realistic.  His system is success oriented for ""him"" to painting in a photo realistic style for landscapes, still life and portraits.  The person watching and using this information would need to adapt his methods into their own style.  Much of the DVD lessons are about paint mixing and applying the paint to create the effects he gets in his style of painting.  His style of painting is about getting the tone and hue correct on the portrait and he goes to great lengths to achieve this goal.  If this is not your style or how you want to paint, then these DVD's are not for you.
  About the teaching style, his approach and teaching style is very straight forward and direct.  He has developed a precision to the way he does his art that does not follow the mainstream throw paint on a canvas that I was taught in most portrait classes I have taken.  I left these classes feeling very unsatisfied and left art for many years because I wanted to learn a more photo realist style of painting that they were not teaching in school.
There are some people who will turn up their noses at this style of art and say it is illustration and not art.  These would be the members of the conceptual art throw paint of a canvas style of art.  While I appreciate their art.  It is not the art I wanted to do back then.
If there was a criticism about Mark Carder approach, it would be that he does not give much of the theory (color) behind what he does.  He uses a limited pallet of colors (which is good).  So you are using just 5 major and two minor colors.  He is very specific in pretoning the canvas you are working on along with a very controlled method for the under painting/drawing.  There is very little free hand drawing.
If you buy these DVD's, my suggestion is that you go slowly and absorb his methods over a period of several weeks.  Work on several pieces using his methods.  It may feel to difficult for some artists to do this as we have been sort of brainwashed by impressionist,  modern art many art school teachers that this type of art is uncool.",1401062400,6,2621,4.328542094455853
8319548,5,B001LRCFFY,this method takes away all the mystery of mediums and all that time consuming ocus pocus flamish glazing leyering techniques involved in portrait oil painting. Mr Carder method is pretty straight foreword '' You paint what you see ''  with a limited pallet and a lot of common sense.,1373500800,3,283,4.775510204081633
8319549,1,B001LRCFFY,Mark Carder is no longer a part of the website selling the DVD and it is all on the web free of charge. Do a search for Carder draw mix paint.  There is updated info from the DVDs and Mark is there to answer questions from multiple you tube videos that are a much higher quality than the old vids. Tons of info from an artist that loves to teach!,1349654400,6,346,3.942857142857143
8319550,5,B001LRCFFY,"This is a fabulous course for those of us who have not had the opportunity to study art/painting on a more formal level.....or under the tutelage of an advanced artist. I have painted at an intermediate, almost, level for many years and now have the knowledge and confidence to advance my natural 'talents' and skills. He (Mark) is correct in teaching this method as a way to learn to see and mix color, as well as other things, like stretching canvas, studio prep, and development of habits that support skill development. I am grateful to have been able to acquire these DVDs (used), and get on with it.",1327190400,4,605,4.611111111111111
8319551,3,B001LRCFFY,"I will give this moderate approval, since it does examine how to improve color recognition, an immensely important skill for any artist, even an abstract one who does not want to copy nature, but still might find interesting new colors.  Of course, his massively tedious method of copying nature exactly is more precise in a totally dark environment,  but copying nature EXACTLY while sitting in a black room with black clothes holding a tiny color checker while peacocks crow outside is really closer to science, not Art.  This does NOT mean that his method is a complete waste.  He says himself that he does NOT paint like this as a general rule, but that this level of precision is a way to understand values and color mixing--a temporary manic focus on one tiny aspect of art.  It's an exercise to bring awareness to seeing color variations, an important step which many artists ignore in a rush to express themselves. Unfortunately, he doesn't say tell us this until DVD 2, and so conveys the sense all through DVD 1 that ART is a neurotic and tedious obsession with copying nature. This is his biggest error--that ART can be mastered by slavishly following a Method, any method, just as someone might think the best way to learn music is by practicing scales for hours each day.  In fact, it has taken me 30 years to really learn music, and just as many to become an artist, and neither are what I would call fully mastered.  That's the fun.  All Art is a long journey without end of drawing, seeing, failing, painting, thinking, studying, giving up, new beginnings, new styles, backsteps, frustration, euphoria....never just mastering a rote method or producing a fabulous still life on your second attempt!  Use his technique for what its worth--one tiny step in the process, and forget about the black room, light room, color checker, proportianal stick controversy.  Just practice--how to draw and paint--and don't worry if you have a dark room, a hole in the ground,  or a stadium for a studio.  There is no easy path, or quick fix.",1322870400,6,2043,4.756373937677054
8319552,5,B001LRCFFY,"The reviewer is all wrong about a black room. This is the only method that unlocks the secrets to painting. Is this the only method, no. But it is the only one that helped me. I have read hundreds of books and viewed as many tapes. I also wrote to Mr. Carder and he answered my e-mail. Maybe the question was just to stuipd to answer. To that reviewer: turn the light out or maybe your lights are all ready out. This is a great method for understanding without the hype or ""watch me and see how good I'm"" -now you do it"" type of instruction. Most artists can not teach, what they do happens in the mind, its called art. Mr. Carder can paint and teach. Thank you Mr. Carder, no one else has done what you did for me.",1313712000,7,715,4.078014184397163
8319553,5,B001LRCFFY,"I used The Carder Method to paint my first three still lifes, and I have never seen any art instruction materials that come CLOSE to taking the mystery out of painting the way The Carder Method does.  Mark's explanation of how to mix and apply color is very clear-cut and simple, and you get great results!  Without it, I'm sure I would have gotten frustrated and given up with my first painting, but with this method I felt like I was handed 20 years of experience on a platter.  This DVD really is worth the $129 if you want to paint!

You do NOT need a black room to use this method.  Mark does highly recommend wearing dark clothing and putting some dark fabric in a couple places, like in the area behind your back.  He goes on to say that if you still have trouble with glare, you may want to put up more dark fabric, but that's usually not necessary.  The purpose of the dark coverings is to keep glare from reflecting off your paint and making the colors hard to see, something that any artist would want to do.

I recommend this DVD set to everyone I meet interested in learning how to paint.",1257465600,32,1101,4.285024154589372
8319554,5,B001LRCFFY,"The other reviewer is wrong on several accounts.  The price is not $200. but $129.  Mr. Carder explains very clearly on his web site what his method is about.  If you really want to learn to paint still life in oil from a very successful painter (Mr. Carder Painted the official White House Portrait of President Bush) then here is where to start.  I did everything Carder suggested and I was very satisfied with the results.  If you have never painted this is the place to start.  The trouble with the reviewer is he never started.  I might add, you don't have to have a black room.",1250899200,21,583,4.392523364485982
8319555,1,B001LRCFFY,"I bought mine direclty from the artist. He states in his DVD that people pay good money to come to his classes, and then they never paint again after leavaing, and he does not know why. I KNOW WHY. I even emailed him to ask for his help, but he did not respond.

His method requires a room that can either be painted black on all walls and ceiling or draped in black, no other surfaces than black, even black clothing. I can do the black clothing, but I do not have a room I can aturn into a ""black room"".

Since I am not a trained artist, and since his method requires darkness with a light centered above and one above the box, I wanted to know how I could apply what he teaches if I don't have the opporunity to have this type of set-up. I did email him, and I did ask him for his suggestions, but he has not responded. This has been months ago, so now I have spent $200 for nothing unless I can come up with a black room.

Know this before you buy. With Carder's methods, YOU MUST HAVE A BLACK ROOM.

I do understand that a room can be draped in black prior to each time one paintes, but this is not ideal. There would be more time spent preparing than painting.

I do hope this causes Mr. Carder to note what to do if you do not have a black room...on his website would be nice since some of us have made this $200 purcchase and would like not to have wasted our money.",1247270400,13,1374,4.0
