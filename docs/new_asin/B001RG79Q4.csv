8337906,3,B001RG79Q4,"TGG DIRECT (aka Diamond Entertainment Group) offers average quality transfers of films that are not always in the best of condition. With the only 20 movie pack I own by them,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/20-GREAT-WESTERNS-HEROES-BANDITS/dp/B001NVV7G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">20 GREAT WESTERNS: HEROES & BANDITS</a>, there's enough compression to cause visual distortion (pixillation) on side-to-side movement or fast action scenes.

About some of these:

ARCH OF TRIUMPH is a slow-moving Euro-made TV remake of an equally bad 1940s film.
THE LAST OF THE BELLES is a tedious American TV movie based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald story.
SWISS CONSPIRACY: boring! A great cast absolutely squandered.
CONCRETE COWBOYS: stupid! Another good cast badly used.
Every DVD copy of movie trailer spoof LOOSE SHOES is severely edited, from 84 to 65 minutes. Don't expect this one to be any different! (For the complete film, buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KEY-VIDEO-VHS/dp/B0009PE7UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KEY VIDEO VHS</a>.)
BAIL OUT: Poorly-made actioner about bounty hunters.
MAYBE I'LL COME HOME... is severely dated hippie stuff about an upper middle class girl who grunges out in a commune. Includes garbage eating.
Finally--
CROSSBAR: A surprisingly good and inspirational Canadian TV movie based on a true story of an Olympic high jumper who loses a leg in a farm accident and figures out how to still compete.
