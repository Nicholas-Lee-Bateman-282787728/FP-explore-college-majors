8088338,5,B000BKXAFQ,"this is a favorite book of ours and I just recently watched the movie.  My family is not jewish, but it really is just set in a Jewish family, not anything about the Jewish faith.  The story and animation is great!  My kids absolutely love it!  Hope it comes out on DVD soon!",1313712000,,275,4.132075471698113
