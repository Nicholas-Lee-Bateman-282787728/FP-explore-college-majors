848200,5,6304286864,This is a real good movie despite the fact Peter Sellers isn't in it. Alan Arkin does an excellent job of portraying the character of Inspector Clouseau. Alan Arkin uses the same accent and physical humor as Peter Sellers did. The movie is filled with hilarios scenes and of course  begins with a humorous cartoon short.

848201,2,6304286864,"I first saw this movie many years ago on late night television. It looks like it was done on a much more modest budget than any of the Blake Edwards films. Despite the Clouseau character, this isn't nearly as madcap as it should have been, and often comes across as a made-for-TV 60s comedy. Alan Arkin's done much better work than this and to his credit does his best to make the character his own rather than an impersonation. Die-hard fans of the series will probably want to see this movie for the sake of completeness. But without Peter Sellers, Blake Edwards and Henry Mancini is there any reason to have a Pink Panther movie?",1074470400,25,632,4.504347826086956
848202,2,6304286864,"I overcame my reservations about this movie because, well, it has Alan Arkin. He's funny, right?
Well not in this thing, though you can tell that he's trying, but he's dealing with lousy direction, a horrible script, and he's trying to play a character that has been definitively played by one of the comic geniuses of the century.
The plot, as feeble as can be expected for the genre, would actually have some interesting potential if it could have exploited today's digital technology. Imagine a dozen Clouseau's bumping into each other as they all accidentally rob the same bank.
I haven't seen the other Clouseau flicks recently enough to remember if they all were like this, but this G-rated flick had enough gay innuendo to almost consider that this was brilliantly hidden subversive material. Somehow, though, I doubt it.",984873600,9,828,4.9640287769784175

848599,2,6304286864,"to paraphrase Patty Smyth, sometimes talent just ain't enough.
Alan Arkin is a fine and usually dependable actor. he turns up in several of my favorite films, such as The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, The Rocketeer, and Get Smart. but alas, he we find him replacing an actor in what had become his signature role. not even a Sir Laurence Olivier or a Charlton Heston is to be envied under those conditions.
it can be done, so i pride myself on my ability to accept favorite characters (most obviously Sherlock Holmes) as played by more than one actor. hell, my favorite tv series, Doctor Who, practically depends on your ability to accept a cast change. nor am i afraid to point out, for instance, that the supposedly ""definitive"" James Bond was in fact out-007'd by just about everyone who followed him. so let's just say that my advice not to bother isn't driven by that particular hang-up.
it's not like Arkin is a terrible Clouseau. he does a pretty good job once you realize that he's using own interpretation rather than simply cloning Peter Sellers. but he might as well have, since Sellers' shadow looms over every inch of his performance. (although he is credited with introducing a few elements Sellers would pick up when he finally resumed the role a few years later.)
nor is it as though the project was bereft of potential. it has a pretty solid plot as this sort of thing goes, and a pretty well assembled cast gives Arkin what support they can. but they too can only do so much when the shadow of Peter Sellers refuses to get out of their way.
there's also he fact that it was directed not by Blake Edwards, but Bud Yorkin. but Yorkin isn't exactly Ed Wood either, so assigning any blame to him is an ambiguous matter.
well, if nothing else, this film beats the hell out of Edwards' not one but two desperate attempts to maintain the series after Sellers died, Curse Of The Pink Panther and Son Of The Pink Panther. to say nothing of the remake that was so horrendous that not even Steve Martin could save it.
what it boils down to is, i just couldn't get passed the lack of Peter Sellers. here's hoping you have better luck with it. not really expecting, but hoping.",1370131200,4,2177,4.541984732824427

848706,2,6304286864,"Despite the presence of screen great Alan Arkin in the title role, INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU mostly falls on its face. I think the problem with this movie is that the character of Clouseau was still in its infancy - leaving Arkin (and the writers) little to go on. There is no Chief Inspector Dreyfus. No Phantom. No Cato. No Pink Panther.
It wasn't until THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER that Inspector Clouseau became a huge success. And that was because he became more of an overblown - but lovable - cartoonish character.
I will have to admit that the musical score by Ken Thorne is one of the few highlights of the movie. His main title theme ranks amongst those of the immortal Henry Mancini.
Interestingly enough, INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU is better than any of the Pink Panther movies which followed after Peter Seller's passing.",1223942400,,821,4.708333333333333

This had to be one of the worst spinoffs that I have ever come across. It makes me wonder if the script writers and Arkin had even bothered to watch any of the other versions.  Arkin comes across  as an arrogant tot, not like the much beloved fumbling fool as we have come to know in other films. The language he uses it nothing like what we have come to expect from the inspector, and the accents are some of the worst on screen, and if not for the scenery of the day, it's hard to find anything worth watching in this film.  I had to fast forward to the end, just to see if there might be anything of interest.

Some reviewers make much of the fact that Arkin doesn't attempt to recreate Sellers character bringing his own take to the film. I, however, believe in not following the formula more closely than he did as created by Sellers in the first two movies, some of Clousseau is also lost. The opening segment of the Inspector disembarking the plane is about as close as the character gets to the one we know so well. Sure, there are flashes of humour throughout but at times you're left questioning whether your watching a comedy or a drama. If you're a die hard fan by all means purchase this for posterity but don't expect it to see the light of day from the shelf too often if at all. As much as it tries to emulate it's predecessors it never quite makes the grade.",1201046400,2,835,4.32484076433121
848709,4,6304286864,"""Inspector Clouseau"" is the most obscure entry in the Pink Panther franchise, even more obscure than ""Curse of the Pink Panther"" or ""Son of the Pink Panther.""  Technically the third movie in the series, ""Inspector Clouseau"" finds Alan Arkin in the title role of French Inspector Jacques Clousea, a character Peter Sellers had started to make famous in two previous movies and a character that Sellers would become inextricably linked to in four more afterwards.  ""Inspector Clouseau"" lacks the boundless energy of director Shawn Levy and actor Steve Martin's 2006 entry in the franchise or the subtle sophistication of any of director Blake Edward and actor Peter Sellers' indisputable classics, but director Bud Yorkin and actor Alan Arkin's entry is undeniably unique and actually quite entertaining.

""Inspector Clouseau"" finds the ever klutzy Clouseau heading from France to London to France again and then onto Switzerland to take on the psychotic gang behind the Great Train Robbery, led by the mysterious ""Johnny Rainbow"".  Clouseau is assisted by shifty Scotland Yard Inspector Weaver (Frank Finlay, who played Inspector Lestrade in ""A Study in Terror"" and again in ""Murder by Decree"") who arms Clouseau with an array of James Bond-style gadgetry.  Along the way Clouseau, as he's always had the knack to, finds his way into the arms of beautiful babes and takes out dangerous underworld assassins trying to kill him, all completely on accident.

Bud Yorkin's directing style is quite different from Blake Edward's, and the whole movie feels like a completely different animal from any of the other Pink Panther flicks.  But the movie finds a charm and sense of fun all its own.  A lack of a jazzy Henry Mancini score adds to the distance from other Panthers, but Ken Thorne's hummable score is a suitable replacement.  Memorable moments include a scene where Clouseau moves from chair to chair while being debriefed by the Scotland Yard commissioner (Patrick Cargill), a scene where he finds himself ""modeling"" for a seductive photographer, and a hilarious sequence where he and Weaver become intensely competitive playing games on a speeding train.  There's also a sufficient number of twists and turns that make this movie worth a look despite its obscurity.",1152576000,3,2269,5.174863387978142
848710,2,6304286864,"Hey, I like have a complete set of films in my collection for each franchise.  So, this is part of the Pink Panther legacy and although Arkin tries, he's no Peter Sellers and the plot is so weak that it collapses at the end and the movie finishes so fast you'll think that that ran out of time.",1141862400,3,294,4.068965517241379
848711,4,6304286864,"Not too long ago I heard about a Pink Panther movie titled Inspector Clouseau (1968), released between A Shot in the Dark (1964) and Return of the Pink Panther (1975), and featuring Alan Arkin (instead of Peter Sellers) in the title role, and my instincts told me it couldn't possibly be any good.  When it was finally released on DVD, I was a bit apprehensive to pick it up, given my affinity for the late, great Mr. Sellers, particularly in his Pink Panther roles, but I decided to give it a shot, and you know what?  I didn't hate it...actually, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would...written by Frank and Tom Waldman, both of whom were responsible for the screenplay for the 1968 film The Party (a most excellent film featuring Sellers), and directed by Bud Yorkin (""All in the Family"", ""Sanford and Son""), the film features, as I mentioned, Alan Arkin (Catch-22, Little Murders) as Inspector Jacques Clouseau.  Also appearing is Delia Boccardo (The Adventurers), Patrick Cargill (Carry On Jack), Frank Finlay (A Study in Terror), Barry Foster (Frenzy), Clive Francis (Romeo and Juliet), and Michael Ripper (X the Unknown, The Brides of Dracula), a great character actor who appeared in a large of horror films released by Hammer Studios from the 1950s into the 1970s.

The story begins in England, as the authorities are busy investigating a large scale robbery that netted the gang involved some two and a half million pounds, which is believed will be used to finance an even larger heist.  Due to security leaks on the force, the decision is made to bring in an outsider in that of the famous French detective Inspector Jacques Clouseau.  During an interview with a prisoner (who subsequently escapes), Clouseau gets a tip on the leader of gang, a mysterious individual named Johnny Rainbow.  From here it's a series of misadventures as the bumbling detective bounces from one wacky situation to another, narrowly surviving numerous assassination attempts purely through dumb luck.  Along the way he meets up with an attractive Interpol agent, and ends up rubbing his English counterparts the wrong way given his comical arrogance.  Eventually the criminal plot is revealed, and it's a nefarious plan involving stealing Inspector Clouseau's identity and robbing a large number of banks across Europe, with the generally hapless Clouseau intended as the patsy.  The grand theft goes off as planned, but Clouseau, like a persistent rash, always manages to find himself smack dab in the middle of things (whether he realizes it or not), despite his blundering and incompetent nature, taking us on a comical romp across Europe.

I had heard the reason Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards, who wrote and directed the two, previous Pink Panther films chose not to participate in this third entry pretty much because they were burned out on the character, and needed a break.  Given the successes of the previous films, it's not surprising the studio forged ahead without them, for better or worse (Edwards and Sellers would reunite for the release of 1975's The Return of the Pink Panther).  Okay, Alan Arkin is no Peter Sellers, but he does have some comical chops (check out the 1979 film The In-Laws).  The one, main aspect I struggled with in terms of this film was my constant comparing of Seller's Clouseau, which is obviously the standard, to Arkin's.  The two never really came close, but only because Sellers was a genius in understanding and presenting the nature of the character, while Arkin is just pretty much playing the part.  In Arkin's defense, there are few who could follow Sellers, but he gave it a good try, the result being half the time it worked, and half the time it didn't (the biggest fault I saw was Arkin's character was prone to goofy, strained histrionics).  The effort was here, but it can't help but seem hollow at times compared to what came before...there was one, really odd scene near the end, when Arkin's character uncharacteristically admits defeat (momentarily), as the situation which he's in seems hopeless and beyond his capabilities.  I don't ever recall a moment like this in any of the films Sellers appeared in as Clouseau, only because his character was so steeped in his own confident arrogance that he could never admit defeat, which would lead to even more comical situations.  Another weird element presents itself early on Clouseau is taken to a Scottish festival by his English counterpart, which results in the first, botched assassination attempt, along with Clouseau winning a plum pudding, one that he seems to develop a completely unnatural obsession over, to the point of it being really creepy.  There are some pretty funny moments throughout the film, including an impromptu game of musical chairs with an English police commissioner near the beginning, some antics as Clouseau is outfitted with spy type gadgets, an overly amorous Superintendent's wife, an incident during a funeral of one of the suspected gang members (the bit in the open grave was pretty funny, if not somewhat homoerotic), and so on, along with the expected slapstick, but the gags never really had the punch or zing as was present in the other films.  I thought Yorkin did pretty well directing this film, as he manages to keep things moving along, even if the story felt uneven at times (the whole scheme of stealing Clouseau's identity and using it against him seemed a bit of a stretch, but did result in some funny bits), strung together by some pretty thin threads.  All in all this is a decent enough film, worthy of a solid 3  stars.

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks quite good and the Dolby Digital audio comes through clean.  There aren't really any extras, other than some previews for other Pink Panther related releases including the Steve Martin feature The Pink Panther (2006), The Pink Panther Film Collection 6 DVD set, and The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection DVD set.  I would have appreciated a little back story on this film to have been included, but oh well...

848712,4,6304286864,"Alan Arkin (like George Lazenby in the James Bond franchise) only got to do it once, but in his interpretation of Inspector Clouseau, he pulls it off memorably.  One of the things that makes this movie so good is that Arkin's Clouseau is organic to the movie and so the movie clips along at a decent pace.  Sometimes with Peter Sellers, everything came to a stop so that we could watch him trip and twitch and put his foot into buckets and unsuccessfully try out costumes ... until it felt like the movie ran about ten to twenty minutes too long.  Peter Sellers could be very funny, but sometimes the gag could be tedious.  'Revenge of the Pink Panther' is my favorite of the Sellers entries because it felt like an editor was employed. -- Another thing that makes the Arkin Clouseau so much fun is that he actually seems to be a little smarter than the Sellers Clouseau.  What makes Sellers funny is that he is both stupid and supremely arrogant.  We don't necessarily like him, but he is funny.  With Arkin, you actually end up liking the guy.  There's a sympathetic core to him and this is partly due to the fact that he isn't all that stupid.  He has moments of personal insight (like when he rips up his autographed Sean Connery picture because he doesn't deserve it) and it makes Clouseau interesting. -- Arkin is smart here.  He doesn't try to be Peter Sellers.  This isn't imitation.  It may not even be interpretation.  What Arkin has to work with is a funny and smart script, wonderful locales and a team (like the Lazenby Bond) who bent over backwards to bring out a Clouseau movie that doesn't have the original Clouseau.  What it amounts to is a funny (at times, hilarious) movie that shines in the Pink Panter franchise.  This movie isn't just a curiousity.  It's a terrific comedy that's worth a look.",1140307200,10,1816,4.524539877300613

Arkin is a consummate actor and an adept comedian.  His performance here is ever so slightly informed by Sellers and he adds a few of his own comic fluorishes to the Clouseau character.  After a while you forget Sellers isn't in the film and accept it for what it is.  The film does have a nifty plot involving a gang of thieves whose masterplan is to rob the Zurich bank and frame Clouseau.  Peter would be proud.",1139097600,4,563,4.365384615384615
7868484,5,6304286864,Alan Arkin can play comedy better than anyone when he puts his mind to it. And he did a damn fine job here in Inspector Clouseau as the inspector himself perhaps even better than the late great Sellers.,1512950400,2,202,4.342105263157895
7868485,3,6304286864,"I grew up watching and loving the Peter Sellers Pink Panther movies. Yesterday, I found a $3 Dvd of Inspector Clouseau at Amoeba Records.
Obviously Alan Arkin is no match for Peter Sellers, much like George Lazenby is no match for Sean Connerys James Bond.  Arkin borrowed some elements of Sellers creation, but largely tries to add his own flourishes to the character. Missing are the ridiculous accent, the cat and mouse games with Cato, the rivalry with Chief Inspector Dreyfus, ane even Arkins bumbling and pratfalls are half-hearted attempts to mimic Sellers (who could masterfully develop a series of  gags, like the interrogation of the house staff in The Pink Panther Strikes Again).

All in all, this is not a bad movie, but it does not live up to the expectations set by The Pink Panther or A Shot In The Dark. Even the directing is flat; where funny premises are set up, but not fully fleshed out. Perhaps the best instance is when Clouseau mistakenly does audio surveillance of a tv set. In the hands of Blake Edwards, this scene could have provided a much funnier impact (even though Bud Yorkin did direct some great movies, particularly Start The Revolution Without Me). In fact, a lot of the movies ideas were presented but not fully developed; like why the main actress falls in love with Clouseau. Also, sorely missing is the music of Henry Mancini. There are some very good supporting actors in this film ( Patrick Cargill, Barry Foster, etc.), even if we are missing Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk.

I believe Inspector Clouseau is probably better than Steve Martins attempts (John Cleese should have been Inspector Clouseau), which I refuse to watch; therefore, I would say watch this movie and try not to compare it to the vastly superior Sellers/Edwards movies.",1510963200,,1779,4.822950819672132

The film is about 10 minutes longer than it needed to be, but overall it's well placed, the plot holds together, and they don't dwell on any one scene too long.
