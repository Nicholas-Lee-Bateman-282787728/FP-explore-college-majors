3713551,3,B000059ZWH,"I knew to expect an old black and white movie from the reviews but I wasn't quite prepared. It is so bad it is funny and if they lost the long random music scenes I might have made it through the whole movie. I just couldn't get past the fact that these actors were playing a 17 year old and a 24 year old when they look to be at least mid-30s. And I am sure that it was meant to show her innocence but what 17 year old, no matter what era, would carry around a stuffed animal everywhere she goes. Go into watching this movie thinking it will be horrible and you will be surprised that its just bad/ok.",1441324800,,602,3.9834710743801653

3713557,4,B000059ZWH,"While most of AIPs teen-oriented flicks of the late 50s focused on juvenile delinquents or monsters (and usually a combination of both) DIARY OF A HIGH SCHOOL BRIDE is much more along the lines of a teenage soap opera. 17 year old Judy elopes with 24 year old Steve and they must do battle not only with Judy's disapproving parents but with Judy's psychotic former boyfriend. The film contains enough action that the melodramatics don't get the film too bogged down and amidst the wild hystrionics there is an odd plug for another of AIPs 1950S releases, THE SCREAMING SKULL. And, aside from the fact that the young leads (Anita Sands and Ron Foster) look old enough to be the parents of teenagers themselves, the cast puts forth a good effort with the script that they have to work with! Look for former one-time Lone Ranger, John Hart, in a small role as a policeman. All in all if you are a fan of this kind of feature you won't be disappointed with DIARY OF A HIGH SCHOOL BRIDE!",987984000,,982,4.4916201117318435

8323871,4,B000059ZWH,"B-movie plot about a 17-year old who marries a law-student.  Her family opposes it and creates predictable problems. Weird ex-boyfriend does the stalker thing and makes life miserable until he meets an untimely end.  (Hooray!)  It works as a kind of, ""think about this kids"" film... in a campy way.",1465344000,,298,4.92
