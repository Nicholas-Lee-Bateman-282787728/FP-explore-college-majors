Concrete Truck</a>&nbsp;This is a great video for kids and adults alike who are curious about how concrete trucks are made.  The producers went the extra mile and show it actually being built from the ground up and attach pertinent facts and figures.  My kids were glued to the screen watching this!  If I were a teacher, this would DEFINITELY be in my classroom!  I highly recommend this!",1236643200,5,560,6.527027027027027

8320497,5,B001M5BFAG,"Very informational DVD, My son loves it. The DVD teaches how the concrete trucks are built.
The quality of DVD (Picture and sound) has some area for improvement.",1468454400,,161,4.785714285714286
8320498,5,B001M5BFAG,"my grandson (3.5) will pick these first out of all the kid videos Even when he is interested in some new release, he rarely plays it again. With these he watches over and over and over (you get the picture). When one got scratched and would no longer play, he begged for a replacement.",1415664000,,285,4.296296296296297
8320499,5,B001M5BFAG,"This is great; very informative.  Jake took it home with hiim to watch it there, but asks to watch it every time he is here, so we need another, I guess.  It is much better than most kids DVDs as they actually were in the factory, and the workers were building.  The grownups probably like it as much as the kids do, and find it both entertaining and informative.  The garbage truck one seems to have been filmed in the same factory, as occasionally we could see a garbage truck in the picture.",1362182400,,494,4.279569892473118
8320500,3,B001M5BFAG,"This is not nearly as interesting for 3 year old boys as the Might Machines series. It's pretty ""talky"" and doesn't show quite enough action. My grandson will watch a Mighty Machines video over and over again but watches this only sporadically and sometimes doesn't even sit through the entire show.",1325980800,,299,4.882352941176471
8320501,5,B001M5BFAG,"These DVDs are going to be a present for my son from ""Santa""--he's obsessed with ""trains, planes, and automobiles"" Recently, he's been really into garbage trucks and keeps asking how they make them. I found all of the ""How'd they build that"" DVDs in a box set at the actual website [...] ...it's less than $40 for all of them!",1323734400,,326,4.45
8320502,5,B001M5BFAG,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my 2 grandsons, and their mothers report that they watch them over and over.  Such a great, educational and fun gift!",1313712000,,154,4.310344827586207
8320503,5,B001M5BFAG,"My son likes this because it is jam-packed with cement trucks.  I like it because it is actually interesting (well...the first few times you watch it, anyway).",1303948800,,159,4.888888888888889
8320504,5,B001M5BFAG,"This video, along with the others in the series (School Bus, Big Truck, Garbage Truck and Concrete Truck) have kept my boys busy for hours and hours.  I have three boys, 3 and 5 and 6, and they all sit glued to the tv watching the different scenes over and over (don't worry, I do give them breaks!).  The scenes are all fun and the boys can't get enough of the sounds, the dirt and the BIG TRUCKS.  These videos were totally worth the money and I recommend them.  The kids love to see how things are made and how things work.  :-)",1272844800,3,531,4.116504854368932
8320505,5,B001M5BFAG,This is a awesome video and great for all ages.  I gave this gift to my grand children and they loved it.  What kid wouldn't love to watch a video about trucks? They have watched it over 50 times already.  Thanks!,1252281600,3,213,4.146341463414634
