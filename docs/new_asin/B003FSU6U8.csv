8396121,3,B003FSU6U8,"I love mousy movies. However I ordered this movie and it skipped, so I never was able to keep the dvd. I have seen it before, but its best to see it before buying. If you're picky with movies, I wouldn't recommend it. Their is slow parts in it and humor is mild. Only some parts made me chuckle. The animation isn't that great, but its a movie made in Denmark by an indy film company. Very light in the story line, which is about a rat that finds an ugly duck who wants to profit from his ugliness. Eventually the duck is like a son to him and they end up saving each other. Its not as heart warming as I wrote it and it can be boring and dull.",1382572800,5,644,3.9236641221374047
