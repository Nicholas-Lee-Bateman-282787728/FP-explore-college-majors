8343582,1,B001PTIPUC,"The age of the movie (forty years plus)  shows - terrible sound, shaky camera, grainy picture, washed-out colors.

as for the movie itself, it has it good moments, but the lowest point was Rosa in old age played by the same actress who played Rosa at the age of twenty,
The theatrical makeup was so horribly done that she looked as if someone placed pink colored jelly on her face.
it was so fake and awkward - it made me cringe.
the acting was over the top or completely wooden, nothing was natural.
I felt I was watching a production done by high school amateur theatre group, using their 8mm camera

8343585,5,B001PTIPUC,"The product arrived earlier than expected (10 days instead of 25), quality package: excellent service.
Very moving and interesting film. Lot of nuances, happy end, plenty of themas (woman condition, education, nature of love mother/wife, ambivalence of levirate). Good actors.
Relatively rare film (not easy to find in shops, even in Israel, no possibility to book it) - it is great that Amazon provides it.
What I would have wished: the film is in English (which is ok for me). I would have appreciated possibilities of subtitles in other languages (Hebrew, French, ...).",1304380800,7,572,5.161290322580645
8343586,5,B001PTIPUC,"VCI Entertainment presents ""I LOVE YOU ROSA"" (aka: Ani Ohev Otach Rosa (Hebrew) (1972) (72 mins/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- This story centers on the Jewish practice that requires an unmarried brother to marry the childless widow of his dead brother --- In this story the younger brother is only 12 years old when his brother dies --- The requirement is avoided by a legal fiction, but as time passes in the story, the situation changes.

This film is one of the best written stories of the young Israeli film industry --- Excellent cast and well acted, and a beautiful period piece showing life in Jerusalem in the 19th century --- This was the last film that Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus produced in Israel before moving to Hollywood and found Cannon Films --- On the strength of this movie they got backing for their new company. Michal Bat Adam is stunning as Rosa, a young widow caught in the web of ancient religious edicts -- wonderful screenplay.
