8692948,5,B00QTUB4C8,I came across this movie by accident and thought it was a very good romance movie.  It has a very enjoyable story with interesting characters.,1461024000,,142,4.68

8692950,1,B00QTUB4C8,I suffered through it. I kept watching because I paid for it. Next time I'll watch a trailer before renting movies I've never heard of.,1454198400,,135,4.44
8692951,2,B00QTUB4C8,"Very slow and incredibly boring.  I watched the whole movie so I could give an honest review......absolutely no chemistry at all between the two main characters, story line is so scripted and bland...can't believe this even was made.....",1439424000,,237,5.2368421052631575
8692952,4,B00QTUB4C8,"Alan is at a bit of a low point in his life. He was jilted at the altar, he works in Tourist Information at Dublin Airport - with his mum - and he still lives with his divorced father. He is in a band that is so unsuccessful that they are considering giving up music altogether and just being a Weddings band.

Then on Valentine's Day a beautiful American rocks up to his desk looking for a hotel as her flight to the Big Apple has been held up and she is now on a stand by for the next flight home. He has always held a soft spot for her and so chances his arm and invites her out for a `night to remember'  in the fair city of Dublin.

Now this ticks all the boxes in terms of plot ingredients and we have a very inclusive night of entertainment with as much thrown into the mix as is humanly possible- to say what that is though would spoil all the surprises. There are quite a few laughs here but some are a tad too bleedin' obvious and haters of stereo types will point at the far too many on show here making this a bit of a clich central. However, it is still a really nice film and Brian Gleeson (son of Brendan) is really likable as the down at luck Alan. His muse in the shape of Jessica Pare (`Mad Men') is both enchanting and vulnerable in equal measure. I really like Dublin and as a backdrop it works really well, but this keeps itself firmly in the realm of rom com, so if you like that you will not be disappointed; if you yearn for gritty realism and despise clichs then do not even consider this one - I for one quite enjoyed it.",1432166400,,1547,4.016233766233766
8692953,3,B00QTUB4C8,"Extremely formulaic, especially in the 2nd half. Worthwhile for some Irish humour and elements of cringe comedy, but the film overall is sparse, padded, and lacking in charm. Finish-able entertainment but only barely",1431216000,,216,5.575757575757576
8692954,2,B00QTUB4C8,Bad acting and worse writing.  No chemistry between the two.  Didn't finish.  Waste of time.,1426550400,,92,5.0
