8733042,5,B015926ITK,"I absolutely love this dvd!  Medical and nutritional information is presented so clearly by Dr. Boham that it is like having a personal chat with a highly knowledgeable, sincere and approachable physician AND nutritionist who has the time to discuss options with you.  This is an incredibly hard combination to find!  Furthermore, you can stop the dvd to write down information that has been summarized at the end of each section.  This is an invaluable tool which gives hope to people, not just for those with breast cancer but also for those with other cancers and those who need prevention advice.  With this being a dvd, you can watch as much as you can depending on the time that you have and you can repeat sections as needed.  Best of all, the information is provided in plain English, not medical jargon and it is easy to implement.

The meditation component is also very valuable.  As much as I know how valuable meditation can be, I haven't always had the ability to connect with many meditation aids.  However, Heidi Spear is the one person who has been able to help me reach deep relaxation through meditation.  Her soothing voice provides good instruction and can hold my attention.  I found Heidi Spear to be so helpful that I also bought her Universe cd.

I love this dvd and highly recommend it.  So much so that I have bought several copies and gave them away as gifts.  Thanks to Dr. Boham and Heidi Spear!!",1468800000,,1425,4.625498007968128
8733043,5,B015926ITK,"This DVD by Dr. Elizabeth Boham and Heidi Spears is amazing.  The information I learned about breast cancer prevention is information that I didn't have before.  It is all very practical and presented in a way that is clear and easy to understand.  I have not had a doctor give me this much concise information that I could put into my daily life.  I appreciate Dr. Boham's approach to the body and its ways to heal and live a healthy lifestyle.  It makes perfect sense to me that what we take into our body nutritionally, emotionally, environmentally has a cause and effect.  Dr. Boham's information gives us a guide and knowledge to help facilitate healthy choices to live an optimal life.  Heidi Spears meditation instruction is a wonderful tool to sit with.  It is a jump started into mindfulness and quiet that we so desperately need these days.  This dvd has opened my eyes to a whole new approach of looking at health, prevention, and lifestyle.  I wish all of my doctors could have this dvd and learn from functional medicine and its approach.",1448323200,,1051,4.663043478260869
8733044,5,B015926ITK,"Breast Wellness should be required viewing in every medical school in this country!

8733047,5,B015926ITK,"This DVD is such a treasure for two reasons:

1. It has a great deal of practical advice about how to stay healthy and prevent cancer from forming in your body. This comes from a world leader in functional medicine, Dr. Elizabeth Boham. She presents the information in a way that's easy to understand, as well.

2. The meditations from Heidi Spear are relaxing and enjoyable, but very effective, as well.

The two women together make a highly knowledgeable and deeply compassionate team to inspire all of us to live more healthfully and mindfully.",1446940800,,547,4.797872340425532
8733048,5,B015926ITK,There are no resources out there for people who want to understand the functional medicine approach to breast wellness. This DVD is amazing. I was I had Dr. Boham's insights many years ago when my own aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer. Powerful information and highly recommended.,1445904000,3,284,5.0638297872340425
