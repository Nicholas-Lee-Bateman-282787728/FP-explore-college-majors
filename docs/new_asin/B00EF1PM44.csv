5910834,5,B00EF1PM44,Packaging several epic films together is a win-win.  Saves methe trouble of ordering each independently and needing 3 times the storage space due to single packaging --- helps me save valuable shelf space!,1388534400,6,205,5.212121212121212
5910835,5,B00EF1PM44,"I'm a major sci-fi fan and when I found out about this pack, I couldn't pass it up.

For those of you who may have reservations regarding the quality of each film in a set like this, you can put your fears to rest. These films have NEVER looked better. Other releases sometimes have all the films in the set compressed to fit on one disc. Not so here. Each gets its own Blu-ray disc and they even have all the original extras of the individual releases.

Logan's Run features a commentary with the director, the costume designer & star Michael York, the featurette ""A Look Into The 23rd Century"", and the original theatrical trailer.

The Omega Man features an introduction by screenwriter Joyce Corrington & co-stars Eric Laneuville & Paul Koslo, the featurette ""The Last Man Alive - The Omega Man"", and the original theatrical trailer.

Soylent Green features a commentary by Richard Fleisher and Leigh Taylor-Young, two featurettes (A Look at the World of Soylent Green and MGMs Tribute to Edward G. Robinsons 101st Film), and the original theatrical trailer.

Whether you're a sci-fi fan, a film buff or just a Charlton Heston fan (the set's two Heston films are worth it alone) this is a great set at a fantastic price!",1386374400,91,1224,4.700934579439252

The audio & video quality of all three are much improved over their older DVD versions, and the bundle set means you save shelf space & money. A solid deal for avid collectors and those looking to sample older sci-fi greats.

LOGAN'S RUN...
THE STORY (contains spoilers): In the distant future, the outside world is a place long forgotten. Society now lives in enclosed domes, freed from all responsibilities and encouraged to indulge in pleasures of the body & mind. An idyllic, utopian existence. But there's just one catch: when you reach 30, your current life ends. You must participate in an elaborate ritual known as ""Carousel,"" during which you will supposedly ""renew"" and therefore live forever. However, it is whispered by some that Carousel is a lie and that the only way to survive past 30 is to seek a mysterious world outside the City domes; a place called Sanctuary. To determine whether Sanctuary is a genuine threat or merely a myth, the City rulers order a ""Sandman"" (a sort of police officer) named Logan to pose as a ""Runner"" in order to infiltrate the underground movement, kill its members and locate Sanctuary, if it exists, so that it can be destroyed. Logan's fellow Sandmen, not informed of his special assignment, believe that he's become a Runner now, and they relentlessly pursue him. Terrified, and with no one to turn to or trust, save an spirited young girl he met just a few days earlier, Logan finds he truly must run for his very life ...or be killed! Will he escape? Is Sanctuary real? If so, can he find it? And what is the secret behind the City and its residents?

THE OMEGA MAN...
THE STORY (contains spoilers): The second big screen adaption of Richard Matheson's classic ""I AM LEGEND"" - a scientific interpretation of the vampire mythology. Charlton Heston plays Dr. Robert Neville, a military research scientist. When one of the biological weapons he helped create is accidentally released it devastates the entire planet with frightening speed, either killing people outright or mutating them into quasi-vampire albino zombies. Neville's team races to develop a counter-agent, but it's too little too late. Civilization collapses and the sun-fearing demons take over. In the years that follow, Neville's endless searching & repeated radio messages go unanswered, and he comes to believe that he is lone survivor of the human race. He ruthlessly hunts down the bloodthirsty freaks during the day, as their bizarre condition forces them to cower in the shadows, avoiding the burning rays of the sun. When darkness falls, he barricades himself inside his heavily-fortified brownstone apartment building. When he discovers, quite by chance, that he isn't the last man on Earth, he is galvanized into completing the immunizing serum ...and his own body chemistry made hold the answer. But, can he save the handful of survivors he's found BEFORE the well-organized cult of fiendish ghouls destroy them all??

SOYLENT GREEN...
THE STORY: In the depressing, over-populated world of the near future, people are crammed into every nook & cranny of our polluted, crumbling cities. There's no privacy, not enough room and very little food. The unwashed masses are fed with synthesized protein wafers subsidized by the government. Made from Soybeans & Lentils and other natural ingredients, there's SoyLent Red, SoyLent Orange, and the newest offering: SoyLent Green. During a routine police investigation, Detective Robert Thorne (Charlton Heston) uncovers a twisted trail of murder & corruption. The conspiracy eventually leads to a shocking, unfathomable discovery; one which will shake the very foundations of what's left of decaying society. The totalitarian government will stop at nothing to keep Thorne from exposing that secret. Will he live long enough to get the word out before he falls prey to the truth???

THOUGHTS: These are three of the swingin' 70's best science fiction offerings. Solid star power and some pithy concepts keep your attention. Too, the vivid set designs and interesting (if dated) special effects are fun to gawk at. LOGAN'S RUN is the most futuristic & stylish of the three, while OMEGA MAN and SOYLENT GREEN are (by necessity) gritty & depressing urban guerilla films that give the viewer lots to think about amid the post-apocalyptic chaos. Despite the groovy trappings & leisure suit-era look of these films, they offer great escapism with some interesting (and occasionally downright horrifying) ideas for you to ponder while you watch. All 3 films are highly recommended viewing, for both sci-fi aficionados and movie fans in general.

THE BLU-RAYS: Each film is on its own disc, looking worlds better than they do on DVD, so this purchase was a no-brainer double-dip that allowed me to upgrade from my existing standard-def copies. The films' video offer sturdy pictures, mostly sharp focus and strong colors with good solid blacks & strong mid-tones. The audio on all three is clear & clean and the soundmixes are level. Each film comes with various bonus features, most simply ported over from the DVD format release. For the improved sound & picture alone, this 3-disc set is an excellent value.",1480118400,3,5340,5.084378563283923

Soylent Green Is an iconic film! Heston give a strong performance in this classic sci fi about pollution and over population.
Heston appears again in Omega Man a take on the Last Man on Earth or I am Legend. The original story is by author Richard Matheson who even though was a prolific script writer never did one for his own novel. Hestons version is good but it is more action than a tale of  a planet that is in it's death throes due to an epidemic.",1465257600,,662,4.084615384615384

5910959,5,B00EF1PM44,"If you're a fan of any of these movies, the triple feature cost far less than buying any of the single discs, when they were available.  This review is about the discs and packaging rather than the movie.

Having seen all 3 as a kid in theaters, and being very disappointed in all subsequent replays on NTSC TV, then later pleased by the improvement in quality when played on HD cable, but bluray is the _ultimate_ in quality video and sound, at this time.

These 3 are remastered well, as they appear better than any version I've seen before it, and look like they were made just yesterday.  The clarity is exemplary of bluray and reveals subtle flaws.  In Logan's Run, the switch between miniature and sets are more apparent.  The texture on the clothing are striking as well as details on actor's faces and bodies; Farrah Fawcett or Jenny Agutter were stunningly attractive in their prime, but I never saw them in HD clarity, even when the movie was released new in theaters.  Logan's Run suffers in some scenes with scratches and faded colors, but overall its better than I've ever seen it.  The commentaries are very illuminating as there were scenes removed to reduce running time that gave the story more depth had the 'director's cut' existed at the time.

Omega and Soylent are set in dystopian near-future, so there are fewer faux pas in special effects but the clarity of bluray makes scenes shot on sets obvious as well as the use of matte paintings in a scene.

The audio in all three is digital clear.

The discs came in a plastic case with disc holders bound to the spine, so discs mounted and can be turned like a book.  A plastic insert in the case provides the graphics.  This disc also has a redundant paper sleeve with the same graphics as the insert.  All discs played.  There is at least one making of short, 1 trailer, and a commentary for each movie.  The commentaries are very illuminating because it was made by key person(s) in production years after the movie was made, so it was more a 'looking back,' a history of the film as well as a reflection of careers of key people.",1433203200,10,2102,4.521164021164021

If you forget everything you know about CGI and put yourself back in the 70s looking at it for the first time, you'll realize they were ahead of their time. Since Omega Man was already remade (I am Legend), you'll quickly wish someone in Hollywood would get off their butts and remake the other two! They're just the perfect topic for a remake.

5910995,5,B00EF1PM44,"Great collection of classic sci fi movies in high defection!
I bought it for 'the omega man' because I wanted a copy of this film because I loved will smiths 'I am legend' which is an updated version of that movie. This film from the 1970s looks great in high def and a good one for the collection.
I'd never seen soylent green but heard about it thanks to it being referenced in a simpsons episode. I enjoyed this one immensely. It's a little slow, but a worthy if strange viewing experience - and I was actually caught by surprise at the twist in the end! Interestingly, although set in the future, it in no way tries to make the environment look too futuristic and it might as well he set in the 1970's - probably intentional due to the bleak future it predicts, but still giving it a charm of its USB when you watch if.
Logan's run is another good one, watchable mostly to see the cheesy 1970's special effects and model shots to depict the future. If never heard of this film but enjoyed watching it and gave since read up on it to find out it was quite popular.
All in all  this package is a nice selection. Great to have 3 films showing the 1970's view of what the future may be like, and 2 of them featuring the legendary Charltkn Heston!",1418428800,2,1246,4.257383966244726

Sure, the guesses at future technology is almost painful to watch (especially the video game in Soylent), but the plots, acting and effects are great. Remember - these were shot before CGI was even a term. These are practical effects, real explosions (often cheesy) and crude robotics.

If you're a Heston fan or a fan of classic SF, these are a must-have for any collection!",1392854400,20,487,4.785714285714286

Sadly, it was Edward G. Robinson's last movie--he died only 12 days after shooting the last scene.
Chuck Heston's best friend (in real life) was Edward G. Robinson; and Chuck was *not told* that EGR was in fact dying, until just before shooting the scene--Charlton Heston's tears are *real* as he just learned his friend was dying. So sad.

Plus, the idea of women as ""furniture,"" they come included in the purchase of the apartment/condo.  So politically incorrect to our Y2K+ ears.  And, it makes you think about what's valuable, like grape jelly or steak or even celery.

They totally missed the ""internet,"" relying on ""books"" for knowledge.  Every teenager should watch this.",1514764800,,758,4.875
