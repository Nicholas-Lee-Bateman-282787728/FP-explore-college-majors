8510681,1,B0075ZX9CO,"This show is being billed as a documentary.  Remember the ""Blaire Witch Project?"" Yeah that was real too.  If you buy this remember the old adage: ""A fool and her money is soon parted.""  Save your $20, you're going to need it to buy a quarter tank of gas when the coming depression hits, and you can always pick up a used copy of the Blaire Witch Project if you need a cheap flick-fix.",1354492800,2,385,4.175675675675675
8510682,1,B0075ZX9CO,This movie is advertised as a 'documentary about the capture of a Yeti in 1947' but that is deceiving. In reality it is just a cheap horror movie either made in the 1950s or made in 1950s style. It is as little a documentary about the Yeti as 'Gone with the Wind' is a documentary about the American Civil War. Save your money for something better!,1345420800,6,348,4.287878787878788
