Very helpful and informative! I really enjoyed watching this, May 22, 2003

This video presents feng shui in a clear and interesting way. Jenny Liu's approach is comprehensive and practical. She is an excellent speaker. I was able to use some of her tips, like the furniture placement and various cures to improve the feng shui in my house. I felt the difference right away. I also enjoyed the cultural perspective. It means more to me when I know that Jenny Liu is Chinese and learned feng shui passed down from her ancestors and from original Chinese texts. I think there's a lot of misinterpretation and oversimplification by non-Chinese practictioners on the subject. There's a handy booklet included with this video on bedroom feng shui as well as a chart to look up your own direction pattern based on your birthdate. The pace of this video is upbeat, which is good because I found other videos to be quite dry.

This was better then Feng Shui for dummies DVD which I also rented. Jenny Liu you can tell easily is more intuitive & gave much more info about how Feng shui works & how it can influence people then other videos I've seen or books. You also feel a more excitement about wanting to learn more & putting it to use with the way the program was edited/styled.

I even checked out her site liu-fengshui com & even found great artwork that you can can't take your eyes off, but locically might not be your taste. Friends have said the same thing.",1160438400,15,1578,4.592198581560283

This will not teach you the art of Feng shui placement or give you ""cures"" for your home. It's focus is on why you should hire an expert such as herself to show you how to bring harmony to your home. A wonderfull salesperson, I'll give her that! The only reason for the 2 stars are for the presentation of her program.",1094947200,,406,4.151898734177215
