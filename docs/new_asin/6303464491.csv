647599,3,6303464491,"Jarman's sebastiane is certainly a daring attempt in the 70s'. It's no wonder that it created a riot at the time of its premiere. The aritistic aspect of the film is quite good but to have the dialoque in Latin is rather pretentious.  And Leonardo treviglio does not strike one as a looker although his physique is okay.  For me sebastiane should have at least a noble feature or bearing and more impressive physical appealing.  But Treviglio is not even handsome or even classy, as a matter of fact he verges on ugliness, I mean his face. The torture scene is rather sexy though, where maximus pulls hot oil on sebastiane's chest and then rubs sand on him and sebastiane twists his body in agony and groan loudly.  However, the execution scene is rather disappointing, It's lack beauty.  I remember I saw a French film in the 40s' in Thailand. The Thai pronounced the title as Fa Be O La.  There is an episode of Sebastiane in it and the role was played by a very handsome and sexy Italian star named Massimo Girotti.  The execution scene in that one is real art.  It was exquisitely done-I bet you any amount of money that Yukio Mishima would die for.  In conclusion, I wish that some first class director would remake the movie dealing  with the subject of sebastiane and make it supersedes in all respects the ones that came before.",1125273600,9,1336,4.529166666666667

I rented it a few times through the years although I found the quality of the video grainy and not particularly sharp the scenery is barren but stunning.  I'd not viewed it in a number of years and decided to buy it when I saw it on sale and now on DVD.  The viewing quality is much improved but be forewarned the DVD has been edited (which is disappointing).  I'm planning to pass it on to friends.  I still find it interesting, especially in study of Jarman's style through the years.  I did find the new edits most disappointing.  It's of course not a historically accurate film but for any serious film student or buff it is worth seeing once.  I think I'd be more inclined to rent the video and not the DVD.

647602,4,6303464491,"Derek Jarman's first film (made in 1976) is a visually gorgeous film featuring an all male cast in various states of undress. Even if you are not interested in debating whether or not the film truly follows the real life of St. Sebastiane or what views of religion Jarman is trying to project, you can appreciate the film for its unique visual style and celebration of the male body. Here we have gorgeous tanned ripped males running around the desolute landscape in nothing but sandals and thongs (and sometimes nothing at all). The camera in slow motion captures them bathing, frolicing in the surf, riding horses, fighting and making love. This is a highly sensuous film, sometimes violent but often tender and not for those offended by homoerotica. The dialog is in Latin with English subtitles but the dialog on the whole is minimal. The only extra features on the dvd include a brief narrative text about Jarman's life and his filmography. The picture quality is superb.",1114732800,26,976,4.850299401197605
647603,2,6303464491,"I would feel better about this film if it hadn't been supposedly based on the life of St. Sebastiane as the details in the film are so off.  It is pretense to assume it is any bio of the saint.  Instead of seeing the Sebastiane performing acts of kindness for imprisoned christians in Rome, we're off at the seashore, an outpost, where nothing deserving of sainthood happens (there are no miracles accorded Sebastiane anyway, but he was martyred in Rome).  Presumably the location shoot was to save on the budget, in terms of sets, actors and costumes.  But the film presumably wouldn't have been financed if it hadn't been for the ""saint"" angle.  But film maker Jarman seems to be exploring his own agenda, as contrary to Roman military discipline, the soldiers at the outpost are barely clad, and often nude.  Though visually stunning, the nudity and hot sun fall short of an erotic film, too.  And if you're expecting anything graphic, this isn't the place to find it. What you do have is a hunky blond ""captain"" who is in lust with Sebastiane and makes the poor man miserable.  Or does he?  Because Sebastiane - and this is the S/M element - seems less than genuine in his expressed christianity (and was Sebastiane even a Christian or merely someone who helped Christians?) and more about taunting Captain Severus.  It's like the two of them are in some inevitable duel to the finish, with Severus being teased and Sebastiane doing the teasing because he's incapable of anything more substantial.  Instead of a rape, which would occur in most films at this point, there is the inevitable result, the sainted martyrdom, but it seems more about Sebastiane (who speaks as if he is ""in love"" with God rather than loving God) being cool and Severus having tried everything else and giving up in despair.  Two minor points, one being the soldiers at one time hunting down and killing a pig, talking about pork as if they haven't had any for a long time, yet we've already seen they care for their own occupied pig pen, so that's a contradiction.  Also, the more interesting couple might have been Anthony & Adrian but their burgeoning love affair is more background.  So, I had high hopes for the film based upon the reviews here, but found it a disappointment for a variety of reasons.",1105315200,13,2285,4.68
647604,2,6303464491,"With this DVD, KINO presents Derek Jarman's debut feature loosely based on the story of Sebastiane, son of a wealthy Roman family during the days of emperor Diocletian. However, those expecting a historical story of Christian faith should better look elsewhere. Recommented for Jarman completists (an early indication of the filmmaker's later work) but virtually no one else with serious interest in film.
Sebastiane converted to Christianity early on and even as commander of the Praetorian Guard and a personal favorite of the emperor, he did not hide his beliefs, actively renouncing persecutions of Christians, helping prisoners and proselytizing Romans to Christianity. This led Diocletian to order his execution. Roman soldiers shot him with arrows but he survived. A second execution was arranged and he was clubbed to death(288 AD).
However, viewing this film with the expectation of seeing a historical epic or a story of martyrdom, will inevitably lead to desappointment. Historical facts are only a backdrop, serving the filmmakers' intention of presenting the other well known aspect of Sebastiane's claim to fame: his link to homoeroticism and sadomasochism. How this relation came about historically is unclear. Some stories have it that Sebastiane was homosexual himself. Others that he had to refuse the emperor's advances on the grounds of his Christian faith. Whatever the case, it is most likely his repeated depiction in painting ( Procaccini, Pollaiulo, Botticelli, Reni, Bazzi etc) scantily clad and pierced with arows reinforced the associations. In Jarman's film, the Christinity angle seems more of an afterthought, an excuse to add some pretentious sounding monologues that set Sebastiane apart from those around him. The film's opening scene introduces the depravity and decadence of Roman life. In a scene that clearly points the artistic tendencies Jarman's carreer would later follow in an over the top fashion that is not at all concerned with subtlety. The major themes of the film are introduced: Roman life, the persecution of Christians, algolagnic extremities  and Sebastiane's homosexuality and opposition to torture and violence. The film has him stripped of rank and exiled to a remote outpost. From then on, Sebastiane does everything in his power to accentuate his differences from his fellow soldiers (basically they are portrayed as a bunch of sadistic, degraded halfwits so to differ must have been easy for an educated, wealthy Roman with spiritual longing). The film consists of a series of algolagnic torture scenes mixed with a good measure of frustrated ""boredom"" scenes, which unfortunately mirrors the most likely state of its viewers. There is nothing of narrative cinsequence to speak of (save the first scene, the long middle and the ending). Plot is certainly secondary to the films thematic explorations.  The performances are uniformly poor and the Latin ""dialogue"" sounds way too ridiculous in the actors' accents for a film that takes itself seriously, adding to the impression the film leaves as a low budget feature. Moreover, the characters are utterly unconvincing as Roman soldiers. They instead seem as convenient marrionettes in the films attempt to introduce its and convey its preoccupations.
The scenery is certainly one of the strong points of the film. But whereas the barren landscapes emphasize the complete isolation and give context to the soldiers' ennui, the film seems at times more like an excuse for copious amounts of male nudity. There are plenty of ways to enrich a story of utter boredom and debasement but the film sticks to one and drives in the point over and over again, in a sadly repetitive, narcissistic way that reminds more of cheap excuses for sexuality in softcore S&M porn than a story of profound spirituality and psychological torment (I am guessing the spirituality and sexuality/lust are supposed to be conflicted or even paralleled but repetitiveness spoils this).
Overall, the film fails to convey any sort of spiritual longing, significance and verismilitude. Best approaced as an experimental, low budget study of homoerotic sexuality than as a film with narrative and characters.
The DVD has no extras, the image is grainy(perhaps shooting on 16mm and later expanding to 35mm doesnt help) but passable. Rent if you have to see...",1073606400,8,4334,5.316326530612245
647605,5,6303464491,"In Sebastiane (1976), British writer/directors Derek Jarman (this was his first feature) and Paul Humfress created a remarkable historical film and a landmark of gay cinema. It depicts the martyred fourth century Roman soldier, who was later both canonized as Saint Sebastian and revered as an enduring gay icon. The film strikingly balances a cinma vrit depiction of the everyday life of common soldiers and a visionary exploration of one man's defiant growth in faith, even as it subtly questions the nature of that experience. Despite its microscopic budget, it is a remarkably well designed, shot, edited, scored (Brian Eno's first film music), and acted picture. The Kino DVD transfer is very good, especially considering that the picture was originally shot in 16mm, then blown up to 35mm.
The film takes some liberties with the historical/legendary Sebastian, who was never exiled to a remote outpost, and incredibly who was supposed not to have died from the arrows with which he was famously shot - how Emperor Diocletian ordered him killed, and how the film ends - but rather from a second execution when he was clubbed to death. Although the film works brilliantly on many levels - cinematic, psychological, spiritual, aesthetic, even political -what may strike you first is the vividness and authenticity of the ancient world it depicts. Despite an over-the-top prologue at the glitteringly decadent court of Diocletian, and its strategic use of famous Renaissance paintings of St. Sebastian (by Mantegna, Reni, etc.) in the final scene, this film feels like lived experience.
Shot on location in Sardinia, every well-worn costume and dusty prop seems genuine. The dialogue is in the rough ""street Latin"" of its day (with English subtitles), but rather than feeling gimmicky it helps capture the texture of these nine banished soldiers' daily life. Its realism is in striking contrast to big-budget ""sword and sandal"" epics, from the Silent Era to the recent Gladiator, which always look too manufactured. In fact, its stylistic roots are more in the hyper-real mythic films of Pasolini, like Oedipus Rex and Medea.
From stills, you might think that the cast was chosen for their sculpted bodies. But each of these actors, even those in supporting roles, fully inhabits their characters and brings them to life. In particular, Leonardo Treviglio (seen most recently in Julie Taymor's film Titus) gives an intensely restrained, brilliantly nuanced performance in the title role. The constant ribbing and roughhousing among these nine men provides not only verisimilitude, but energy and unpretentiousness.
That is especially important, because the film deals with some dauntingly complex themes, as important now as 1,700 years ago, including the meaning of spirituality, the place of sexuality in life, and the contradictory nature of reality. The film's wild streak of humor, and its breathtaking visual design, help to keep this profoundly serious work from overdosing on ""heaviosity.""
The thematic core, as expected in a work about a man on the road to sainthood, is spirituality; and few films, including self-styled ""religious movies,"" let one feel so deeply the growing importance of faith to an individual. Even some of the translated dialogue is beautiful, as when Sebastian, gazing at his and the sky's reflection in a pool of water, says that divinity is ""That beauty that made all colors different.... The heavens and earth are united in gold."" But while that vision of faith is powerful, it also has many layers, some of which are provocatively ambiguous. For some viewers, a central question will be: Is Sebastian a true Christian or is he a syncretist grafting his personal version of the new religion onto much older, Greco-Roman roots? The film offers different possible answers, not as a dodge, but because the film realizes how multi-faceted religious experience is, growing out of social, personal, and spiritual contexts.
It is also a landmark in the history of gay-themed films. Not only is this an authentic-seeming depiction of the ancient world, it is one in which a person's sexual orientation is not at all an issue. The guys jibe each other equally about their interest in Vestal Virgins, famous female prostitutes, and other men. In addition to this still-refreshing ""backgrounding"" of sexual orientation, the film depicts some of the most genuinely sweet and loving moments of any gay-themed film up to that time, especially in the budding relationship of the minor characters Adrian (whom the men tease about being a virgin) and Anthony.
And Sebastian's sadistically lovelorn nemesis, Captain Severus, is much more than a traditional ""homosexual heavy,"" like the diabolical Claggart in Billy Budd. Severus (played by Barney James) has psychological depth, and seems to be equally divided between raw lust and genuine love for Sebastian. The film also takes a complex approach to him. For instance, the most visually beautiful and tender images of men are entirely from Severus's POV. And during the pivotal seduction scene near the end, Severus is shown as both monstrously brutal and beautiful, his hair ringed with golden light. That is exactly how Sebastian describes his vision of God, earlier in the film.
This is an exceptional film, deeply-felt, beautiful, and complex.",1057536000,127,5318,5.235638921453693
647606,3,6303464491,"Er, this movie is a classic and carries meaning on many levels, but I found it a bit self-indulgent and overbearing at times. Some of the scenes are just too idyllic in a silly ""swords & sandals"" type of way, while the poor Sebastian so obviously wants to be martyred that I soon lost my empathy with him. I was almost pleased when he got persecuted. And the captain who lusts after him is just too obviously of the sadist type that cannot distinguish his power lust from his desire. Some beautiful shots, though, and it is worth seeing. There is something awkward about the film, however, that makes it less than perfect. It is as if Jarman didn't keep enough distance between himself and his work, or he tried too hard to make a ""European Art Film.""",1029974400,4,751,4.449275362318841

647750,2,6303464491,"It's hard to know just where to start a review of this vague hagiography combined with homosexuality, great scenery, lousy photography, an attempt to be true to the times in several ways including dialogue in Latin so lousy I could understand it and it's been forty years since I learned that all Gaul is divided into three parts. For those who wonder about the frontal nudity, yep, it's there but almost to the point that you wish they'd put some clothes on. If there was a set shot involving nude men, it's in this picture, men in water, men sweating, men running, men sleeping, men dumping water on themselves, men writhing, men playing.....Frisbee. (If you watch carefully you can see that the ""discus"" they're tossing about is certified plastic painted gold but, in a couple of scenes, where nude men are catching it, you can see the distinctive logo on top.

I know, because I've been told, that this is a ""great film"" a ""landmark film"" one of the first films to deal accurately with things as they were in the Fourth Century B.C. and that it's particular theme is the coming of Christianity and what many suffered to support their religion. In this case, as the title would indicate, it's Sebastian, later St. Sebastian, who gets martyred in the end...and not a moment too soon.

For those of us who find this all rather put up philosophy, meant to be deep, meaningful, full of symbols and mysticism, there are other ways of looking at it. Let the Philosophical crowd find meaning in every element, I do not. Indeed as it rolled on, I could not decide whether the real influences for this were ""The Day The Fish Came Out"", ""Lord of the Flies"" and, though it hadn't been made yet, ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"". And, yes, it raised questions such as....if naked men romp and stomp all over Sardinia for some little while, why did no one get tan? And in all that romping and stomping, I could not escape the fact that the rompers and the stompers were having a rather hard time of it over stones, thorns, rocks....I suppose that it was decided that the actors would have to face the elements as they were and hope no one broke a foot or an ankle. On the other hand, lace up leather boots were another part of the limited costuming and they were worn when everyone was playing in the water. Maybe there were even more stones there.

At one point a pig is caught, slaughtered and consumed; One wondered if this was meant to symbolize the acting none of which was particularly good save when someone declaimed something and then the ham came out. Significantly, none of the actors who appear  seemed to have any sort of career-although as this was a European made film, perhaps I'm showing a sort of Thespianic Xenophobia. But I don't think so.

And yes, for those who want to see what must be styled soft gay porn, this is part of Cinema 101 in that field. Too many years later it hasn't aged well given newer, more liberal understanding of things sexual but that it was made is some sort of achievement. Shame the picture doesn't have any gravity to it which might have given it some importance rather than the usually forgotten curiosity that it is.",1416355200,,3157,4.551056338028169

Watching it for the first time, nearly 40 years after it's initial release, the pace and other aspects are different than current films and may give cause for my initial dislike.

647754,5,6303464491,"This film is not a religious film. But this film is not an anti-religious film. This film is about the rejection of a group of men banned out of society to some outlandish deserted area and what happens among them who have nothing to do and are under the command of an officer who is banned exactly the same way.

First they are obsessed by sex since it is the main human activity they cannot have, at least in a normal heterosexual way. So they live that sexual obsession in jokes, in some brutality, in some dreams or some homosexual surrogate activities. But even so hunting a wild pig and killing it, having fake fights with wooden weapons are definitely not enough to satisfy their frustrations and their desires. If you are the officer you can order one simple soldier to satisfy your sexual impulse, but otherwise we are in a plain case of playing or raping.

The film, apart from showing the homosexual relation between two soldiers reveals the fact that there are two Christians in the group and they are taken as scapegoats. One of them is Sebastian and he is tortured by the officer and by the soldiers because he refuses to fight because Christians do not fight. The officer takes a great pleasure in whipping him, torturing him day and night, tying him down in the sunshine for hours, trying to force him to accept to let him make love to him, and strangely enough he does not rape him though Sebastian refuses to service him. The soldiers do not touch him because he is the officer's prey, toy, possession. But they get even with the second Christian they torture physically just because he is a Christian. That is segregation and racism, hostility based on pure and simple religious rejection. The person who is not like you, who is different from you is a natural prey to your frustrations and compensations of these.

Then the killing of Sebastian the way it is known in Catholic and Christian folklore is of course staged by the officer who makes each man shoot one arrow at Sebastian and even the second Christian is forced to shoot his own arrow, and Sebastian is abandoned to die of his wounds in the sunshine.

But the film is targeting a far more important and universal theme. Anyone who is different is the potential victim of such persecution, and Derek Jarman is of course speaking of men who are gay in our society, at least in his society in 1976 and how they were rejected, ostracized, violated, raped, brutalized and even persecuted by the police. And beyond this sexual segregation the human species, hence humanity, has always cultivated segregation, persecution and apartheid against those they classify as different. The human species, hence humanity, is a segregative species. This is a deeply pessimistic vision but the evolution on such a subject is slow, very slow, and can take two steps forwards and three or four backwards just afterwards.

The most fascinating and strongest aspect of the film is the way Derek Jarman show suffering as being a beautiful experience. Sebastian transforms his torture into a direct contact with Jesus and God. He transforms the sun into the kiss of God. He finds his love in his being tortured, but his love goes to Jesus and God because his suffering is the proof of Jesus's and God's existence: they exist because he believes in them and because he is made to suffer because of this belief. His suffering casts his belief in bronze and Jesus and God in gold.

Then the plastic beauty of these bodies mostly nude or quasi-nude is just the mirage that Derek Jarman sends into our minds and our eyes: the mirage that the film is only about the beauty of male bodies, these bodies that are nothing but vanity because the only important thing is not the bodies of these men but their moral or ethical integrity, and then life and death are like the two sides of the same coin when you are a Christian. Life is dedicated to longing for death to rejoin the company of Jesus and God. And death is the escape door from the limited and locked up physical life into the eternal life of the soul in communion with God and Jesus, in absolute union with them. When we finally reach that understanding, that deep communion with man's spiritual dream and project, the fact that they are in the nude, undressed does not count any more We do not see it any more, or we do not feel any appeal in that nudity.

That's the real project of Derek Jarman: to make us reach beyond erotic or pornographic voyeurism to lift our souls and minds to the contemplation of purity in the midst of total perdition and sacrilege, perdition of human integrity and sacrilege of human perversity. This film should thus not be restricted because it is the most beautiful lesson of visionary enlightenment.

647837,4,6303464491,"The movie is very loosely based on the legend of Saint Sebastian, the Christian soldier who became a martyr, after accomplishing a number of miracles. The only aspects of the legend used in the movie are that he was a Christian soldier in the Roman army, and that he died when tied up to a column and shot at by archers. While in the legend the reason for his death was his religion, in the film the reason was that he refused to submit to his Captains attempts to sleep with him. This had provoked the anger of the Captain who had previously ordered several, erotic, punishments, such as flogging, eagle-spreading in the sun, etc.

The movie exploits the strong erotic images of Sebastian depicted in so many art works as a young and handsome man, tied almost naked in a seductive pose, pierced with arrows allover his body. These images are used successfully as a climax of the movie, with Sebastian languishing under the arrows, totally naked with long frontal frames. This was preceded by series of extremely erotic scenes of Sebastian and some dozen other handsome young men, frolicking in the sands and waters of some deserted post they are supposedly defending, always either totally naked (with frequent frontal nudity exposing their genitals), or with skimpy string loin cover.

The movie is slow, with a much reduced plot turning around the Captains repeated sexual advances which are always severely rejected by Sebastian, despite his strong longing for the Captain whom he adored. All this has no convincing explanation. Furthermore, since the Captain had total power over Sebastian, he could have raped him instead of putting him to death! The dialogue in the movie is in Latin (with subtitles), with very awkward pronunciation by the mostly English actors, making it unnecessarily clumsy and painful to listen to!!",1378944000,,1828,4.931818181818182

""Dog Latin"" or not, this is not historically accurate [vis--vis St. Sebastian], so the Latin used here does not bolster authenticity. It just disguises the fact that there is little here in the way of a real script.

The look of the film is poor - washed out color, poor composition, rambling scenes without focus or meaning. No significant music. No apparent plot. It would probably appeal to an S&M guy with master/slave fantasies. The guys have nice bods and great asses, but this is neither drama, porno, soap opera, reality TV or, from my point of view, any worthwhile genre of film. For eros, during this time period [pre-Stonewall repressed USA and UK], my vote would go to Morrisey's charming, sexy and amusing oeuvre, Trash, mostly because D'Alessandro oozes sex from every pore as he lays in bed, twisting his body with a perpetual hard-on. To me Sebastiane, by contrast, is a bad joke, making gays look like idiots, and providing no real plot or character development - like most porn flicks. Except that guys wrestling on the beach, lolling around on rocks or frolicking in the water, good bodies or not, does not a film make. Along with Brokeback Mountain and Boys in the Band, one of the very worst efforts in gay cinema. Buy it if you want, but it is short on substance, and not much of an accomplishment.",1367539200,2,1495,4.620300751879699

647841,3,6303464491,"Although few people expect film makers to provide historical accuracy, it is worth mentioning that St. Sebastian was clubbed to death on orders of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who disapproved of Sebastian's religious beliefs and habit of converting notable Romans to Christianity.  The film SEBASTIANE is essentially a sado-masochistic, homoerotic riff on the notion of St. Sebastian as he is usually painted, tied to a post and shot repeatedly with arrows (which, according to the original accounts, he survived.)

Directed by Derek Jarman with an assist from Paul Humfress, SEBASTIANE seems to owe a great deal to the works of Fellini, Pasolini, and perhaps most particularly to Ken Russell, for whom Jarman worked as production designer on Russell's notorious film THE DEVILS.  The story concerns Sebastiane (Leonardo Treviglio), who displeases Emperor Diocletian and is banished to a distant outpost.  There his religious beliefs run afoul of commander Servius (Barney James), who wants Sebastiane as a lover.  When Sebastiane refuses, Servius has him executed by (of course) being tied to a post and shot repeatedly with arrows.

The story exists only as an excuse for considerable male nudity, as the soliders exercise, fight, splash around in the water, and have sexual liaisons with each other.  Most of the performers are remarkably handsome in a sinewy sort of way, and the result is indeed memorably homoerotic, and occasionally deliberately distasteful.  And much of the film is remarkably beautiful.  There is hardly a single shot that could not be translated into a great painting by a great artist.  But even so, the film is slow, and it lacks the interest of either a first rate art film or a mainstream commercial property.

People are fond of describing SEBASTIANE as groundbreaking, and in a sense it was; homosexuality and homoerotica were not common film elements in 1976, and the movie provoked a horrendous degree of controversy.  A film of great genius can transcend the limitations of its place and time, but not so SEBASTIANE: what was once shocking is now commonplace, and the whole thing seems more than a little passe.  Recommended to hardcore Jarman fans, and for those who are interested in tracing the development of gay cinema, but most others should give it a miss.

647933,4,6303464491,"I give the movie 5-stars, Jarman was an eccentric soul whose films always seem to reveal hidden secrets with each viewing. This is one of his best.

As for the Blu Ray, however, there is good news and bad news. The bad news is that, even the highly-reputable Kino International wasn't able to completely restore this to breath-taking beauty. There are still a goodly number of flickers and grain and other signs of damage. My guess is that this is probably 90% due to the source material and the fact that the film was shot in only 16mm as opposed to the typical 35mm.

But the good news is that this is probably the best Sebastiane is ever going to look. There are considerable moments of glossy scenery and fine detail that makes 1080p fans swoon, and, just as importantly, there's the fact that it is released uncut in its original 1.66:1 format. The last time I watched the movie it was streamed online and the aspect ratio had been trimmed, unintentionally censoring many scenes.

Overall: as long as you purchase this with the knowledge that the picture quality won't compare to the many flawless restorations done by Kino, you shouldn't been disappointed. It is still 100x better than any previous release and I doubt the flaws are a matter of laziness on the restoration process, but unfortunately due to permanent damage. The movie itself is certainly a classic and would make a proud addition to your collection. The only other down-side is the fact that there are zero bonus features, which is very surprising given the historical importance of the film. If I thought another edition would be released in the next 10+ years I might recommend waiting, but since I highly doubt that, I say go for it.",1344297600,11,1709,4.69
647934,5,6303464491,This is a classic and I enjoyed it. Although an older film great visual effects and a good story line. I can see why it was so controversial when it was made.,1323302400,,158,3.96875
647935,3,6303464491,"After reading other reviews and noting their conflicting opinions I decided to judge this for myself. After I got past the rather silly openning scenes of a roman orgy which places sebastiane's exile into context, the film certainly held my attention to its conclusion. The important thing to remember when approaching this one is first the context as to when it was filmed. This is the mid-70s and a raging gay porno it isn't. Although the homoerotic relationships are evident, they in no way differ from any male-only group thrown together for an extensive period of time. Sebastiane's visions of God and his Christian beliefs drive his revulsion not of male-male sex solely, but of any sexual conduct, whether hetero or homosexual. I firmly believe that if his tormenters were female, he still would have rejected their sexual advances just as strongly. The other thing to keep in mind is that in presenting this story of exiles on a barren island, the director engages in long, expansive and sometimes boring shots of the landscape or characters. The motive appears to be to heighten the sense of abandonment and desolation, physically, mentally and of course spiritually. The climax of the mayrterdom of the hero is silent, graphic and touching.",1194307200,4,1250,5.014423076923077
647936,4,6303464491,"I must admit that I was very pleased to rediscover this movie remastered on DVD. I first rented the movie about twenty years ago. The plot is rather slow, but it has features that made it very appealing to me. It's an historical movie (the latter years of Saint Sebastian's life). It is one of the very first gay-themed movies showing male nudity. I do not agree with an X rating, and I remember when I first saw it as a kid, I was a bit disappointed regading the eroticism of this movie. Of course there is a homo-erotic tension, but again, much was left to our imagination. It was not exactly what a randy college student was looking for.

Luckily, things change and so do the spectacle with which we see and interpret things. The movie is definetely unique - a difficult and slow plot enriched by an often non eloquent dialogue in Latin (with English accent/pronunciation). The actors do not come from a theatre academy, but still appear to do well. It's a low budget movie, and yet the natural beauty of Sardinia (where the movie was filmed) adds to the somehow 'naturalistic' video.

It's an intellectual movie belonging to a somehow cognitive underground genre, which may please those who are attracted by a fusion of ancient cultures, peculiar erotocism, and still (by nature and cognition) have a progressive mindset.",1188259200,7,1325,4.706896551724138
647937,1,6303464491,"Sebastiane (1976), is a supposedly landmark film, I would have to disagree. I don't understand where all the praise comes from. There is certainly a measure of legitimacy in it, but it is lost in all the nonsense that must be an attempt at passing this film off as ""art"" (in 1976) rather than what it really is: a very soft (very very soft) core porn movie.

It purports to depict the martyred fourth century Roman soldier Sebastiane, who was later both canonized as Saint Sebastian and revered as an enduring gay icon.

Even though the film dialogue is supposedly that of ancient Latin, you can still tell that there are a number of performers who did not even bother to attend Acting 101. The little thongs that the men wear (and often do not) is little more than window dressing for the purile interests of the film. Long slow motion shots of Sebastiane, naked, bathing in water he dumps on his own head is painfully dull.

I've got nothing against nudity - heaven knows that - but for pete's sake, even if there's nudity, let's have a decent story and competent actors. This has neither.

If we're watching this film so that we can see men's hoo ha's then fine, let's call it what it is. If we're watching this for a story - don't bother.

I'm so very tired of reviewers praising films as ""groundbreaking"" and calling them ""cinema verite"" when really what they mean is ""amateurish"" and ""badly acted"". There's lots of videos out on YouTube that are far better.

The only reason I got this film was I read that Peter Hinwood (Rocky from Rocky Horror Picture Show) was in it. He is. For about three seconds in the first scene - no dialogue at all.

Boring waste of time.",1184198400,11,1671,4.4769736842105265
647938,3,6303464491,".............but not, so much, for the mind.

DON'T MISUNDERSTAND,
this is a great film, but honestly speaking, I think this film is most notable simply as being a single product of
Derek Jarman's genius; not as being a distinctive masterwork, in itself. If you want to speak in terms
of advancement/positive representation in homosexually themed art,
this is the gold star winner.  Otherwise, the visuals are the only thing that makes this movie noteworthy.

Jarman's Sebastiane is a genuine visual delight.  Within this film lies a
remarkable portrait of the masculine condition (strength, weakness, beauty, intimidation, domination). The brute masculinity of the soldiers is smartly juxtaposed with the arid harshess of the desert in which they are exiled.  As men void of females, they are like any other lifeform that is subjected
to the extremes of the desert:  survive on what is provided or perish therein.

This lofty theme, however, is undermined by poor acting,
questionable historical references, and latin pronunciation (OH MY GOD, THE LATIN!!) that sounds like a Pig Latin translation
of a Shakespeare manuscript (my latin professor would have
gone into cardiac arrest after 2 minutes).

HOWEVER (!!!!)............................

NONE OF THIS takes away from the brilliance of this film. I actually believe this is one of the most beautiful films
ever made. There is surgical dilligence applied to the cinematography. Panoramic sweeps and simple elements like
close-ups of insects are used to give this movie a smooth, lyrical, and almost hallucinagenic effect.

But be aware,
this film is strictly for visual pleasure:  the bodies, the desert panorama, etc. Any desire you may have for anything more profound will certainly go disappointed. A zealous attempt
was made to produce an intelligent film, but it failed in
delivery. This movie is a brilliant example of Jarman's sense of art.
It is not his best work, but at the same time, it is pleasing to watch.

Highly recommendable.",1153872000,16,1998,5.248427672955975
647939,4,6303464491,"This was Derek Jarman's debut film, which he co-directed with Paul Humfress, who was a director at the BBC and was there to assist Jarman in case there were any problems (there were none).  It's actually Jarman's most homoerotic movie.  The dialogue is in Latin, and it was street Latin (or ""dog"" Latin), not proper Latin.  Jarman was very specific about the speech because these soldiers were ruffians; they wouldn't be speaking the queen's Latin, so to speak.  Many have found the famous painting of St. Sebastiane (which Jarman recreates at the end of the film) very homoerotic (Yukio Mishima famously said that it gave him an erection the first time he saw it), so Jarman indulges quite freely in the erotic aspects of the story.  The film has a mythic sheen to it, and it is a film you will never forget.  The opening scene at the Roman orgy is very memorable.  Jarman started out as Ken Russell's production designer, and this orgy scene seems a homage to him.  Brian Eno's eerie, electronic music (reminiscent of his ambient albums, like Music for Airports) really gives the film an another world feel.

This film is NOT for the easily offended.  There are massive amounts of male nudity here, but it's shown as natural, which it is.  Essential viewing for Jarman fans (or which I include myself).",1152576000,29,1304,4.725663716814159
647940,5,6303464491,"After my initial dissapointment with Jarman's second film 'Jubilee', I was a bit hesitant to watch 'Sebastiane' but I'm glad I did because it shed some light on the nature and capabilities of this stage of Jarman's career - he was ambitious, bold, and very resourcefull - this is one of the finest low budget productions I have seen. This is the story of Sebastiane the man who died for his christian beliefs - but in this adaptation the focus is more on the homosexual tendencies of Roman military - it is almost a study in contrast the repression and solitiude of Sebastiane against the indulgences and vulgarity of Rome. There is also a beautiful soundtrack by Brian Eno.",1145750400,14,674,4.6722689075630255
647941,5,6303464491,"Derek Jarman's 'Sebastiane' is a momentous painting which is simply brushed on film rather than canvas. This is a master work and should be in any serious film buff's cabinet. (I should very much like to see it running continuously upon a smooth stone wall of a monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like the Four Seasons in New York. It's visual beauty should be constantly on view.

Not one element could be added or deleted. If I may continue the painting analogy, each stroke, whether finished or raw melds this work into a composition which I think is flawless. The men are beautiful, but in a tangible human manner. The settings, whether Diocletian's startling lurid palace or the rough bare terrain of Sardinia evoke both pagan and Christian motifs flawlessly. Good and evil (and all shades between) found in both places; the irony of the world as it is and has always been.

The homoerotic nature of the film is vicseral, candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well be set in modrn Iraq with 21st century troops. I felt each character's longings, whether for the god of carnal flesh or that of human love and companionship or a spiritual and other worldly deity. The recognituion that each of these forms of eros may entertwine and meld is genious. It is Everyman.

Yes, you will notice throughout the movie that the film has different exposure rates (lots of over and under exposure) and certain things are washed out pretty badly or out-of-focus-- especially outside in the desert. It can be unbearable to some and to others, we just push through because we do want to see what happens with this story. While it was poorly shot 30% of the time (camera angles), I appreciated the authentic feel that came with the costumes, scenery, and spoken language. It did feel like I was back in 300 AD . . . based on the comparable information, art, and existing structures from that time period... because... yes...I'm not that old... har har... The music was very interesting, but I liked it. The dialogue came and went. It just seemed to be quiet. Lots of filmed parts didn't even have audio to capture the background audio. Even though this was shot in the 70s, if they didn't have access to the best film on the market (very apparent), at the very least, they could have hired camera operators/cinematographers that knew how to operate the camera. Basic things like focus and exposure rates and cleaning the film in post-processing go a long way. However, despite those things that cannot be dismissed, I did like it and watched it twice.

My favorite scene was Anthony and Adrian frolicking in the water and the passionate kissing that lead up to that scene. I think it was the best shot and exposed film of the entire movie. I was in a slow motion trance both times. Just watching their bodies fall over each other, seeing the water move over and around them as they splashed, watching their barefeet come in and out of frame, seeing the passion and joy in their faces, and the music that went right along with it. That..... was great.

At least it was only 85 minutes. I say if know that it exists, may as well watch it once.",1422576000,2,2124,4.511688311688312
