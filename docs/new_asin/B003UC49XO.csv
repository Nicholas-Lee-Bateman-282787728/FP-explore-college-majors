There is some information that the set will be sold on Amazon but I haven't seen them offer it yet. Does anyone know if Amazon will offer the full set of DVD's? Or is it only available from the Met Opera Shop?,1284076800,,360,4.013888888888889
4194861,5,B003UC49XO,"I attended one of the performances that were taped for this release - which sat in the vaults for several years.  (There are 2 other Met productions that were taped and remain unreleased: ""Wozzeck"" (rumored to be included on the upcoming James Levine tribute set) and ""Salome"" with Mattila and conducted by Gergiev when the production was new (not the same as the HD telecast several years later.)  In any case, this ""Ariadne auf Naxos"" was a wonderful performance.  The production is magnificent: by turns fanciful, fantastic, and realistic.  The singing was great.  This was Deborah Voigt before she got her stomach stapled and lost her voice.  In this run she sounded glorious.  So did Dessay in a physically demanding role.  Susan Mentzer sounded occasionally strained, but pulled through every time.  And Richard Margison sang Bacchus like few have managed.  Levine conducted magnificently - this has always been one of his favorite scores.  It's a must see!",1283385600,32,963,5.070063694267516

4194863,4,B003UC49XO,Overall a wonderful dvd! Did notice loud footsteps in the first part of the opera which were quite distracting to me. Having seen Ariadne live in Chicago and enjoyed it immensely I also enjoyed this version. Voices were superb.,1332201600,,227,4.846153846153846
4194864,4,B003UC49XO,"This performance of ""Ariadne auf Naxos"" (from 2003) in Elijah Moshinsky's staging, is magnificent, with Deborah Voigt, Natalie Dessay, Susanne Mentzer, Richard Margison, and Nathan Gunn heading the fine cast. Voigt displays a delightful sense of comic timing as the Prima Donna, whose unfinished coiffure is amusingly askew, and then sails through the name part with ease. It is good to hear Dessay in good voice, without the shallow, unsupported sound which sometimes afflicts her singing. Moreover, her extremely naturalistic acting-style is better suited to this opera, rather than the works of the bel canto era that populate her repertoire.

Mentzer is a total success as the idealistic Composer, portraying the young man's rapidly-changing emotions in a delightful manner. Margison sails through the difficult part of Bacchus as if it were child's play, his Heldentenor in complete command. Gunn is fine, as well.

In the smaller roles, Wolfgang Brendel (as the Music-Master), Waldemar Kmentt (as the Major-Domo), and Tony Stevenson (as the Dancing-Master) are veritable delights.

Unsurprisingly, Moshinsky's production is beautiful, blending the elements inherent in the work in a masterful fashion. A 1988 performance from the Met of this opera had previously been published on DVD: There we have the great, magisterial Jessye Norman as Ariadne, with the adorable Stephen Dickson as Harlekin, in his last performance at the Metropolitan.",1325376000,,1446,5.53393665158371
4194865,5,B003UC49XO,"I got this along with the Ponelle film. I purchased this only to hear Voigt and Desay before their operations (Voight for weight loss and Desay for vocal cords). As usual Strauss makes the most out of the female voice, even throwing in a trouser role in so as to have a third major soprano(the composer). If you want to hear Voigt and Desay when they were in top form vocally, then this opera is for you. Interesting concept here with an opera within an opera.",1301875200,4,460,4.3604651162790695
4194866,5,B003UC49XO,"I must join the chorus of Cheers after having watched this performance. It is just wondrous! Everyone, the stars and the smaller parts are just perfect. I've been listening to Ariadne since the days of Elizabeth Schwarzkopf and think it R.Strauss' best work. I've loved the Jesse Norman and many others but this is the cream of the crop. James Levine has the Met orchestra give a grand performance, D. Voigt has such a beautiful lush tone, Natalie sang the Zerbinetta as has never been sung before, Margison was the best Bacchus I've heard and on and on. It took me awhile t ""get into"" Moshinsky's sets but some effects were quite good. Let's just say this is a big star in my collection. I loved it!",1295740800,5,700,4.519685039370079
4194867,5,B003UC49XO,"This is the most exquisite Ariadne I've ever seen!
Why?

First, the music:  James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra bring out all the beauty of Strauss' music at every moment in the opera.

The singing:  Where do I start?  Yes, of course Natalie Dessay vivifies and personifies Zerbinetta as few ever have.  Richard Margison provides the strongest ever tenor voice that sweeps away Ariadne and the audience.  Deborah Voight sings almost as powerfully as Jessye Norman, but with a brighter tone.

The acting:  My impression is that this is the best-acted Ariadne I've ever seen.  Watch for the body language in the interaction between Zerbinetta and the Composer--every gesture adds to the strength of their attraction.  The same effect results from the tug o' war between Ariadne and Zerbinetta.  Watch for Deborah Voight's expression of ""Gotcha,"" when she briefly bests Zerbinetta.  Handsome, rich-voiced and a perfect actor, Nathan Gunn as Harlequin is especially endearing as a playful suitor who is equal to Zerbinetta.  Even the three Muses use their bodies as well as their voices to give their roles more impact.  I should add that producer Elijah Moshinsky has added a touch that elevates the Muses above the other mere mortals on stage, but I'll leave that surprise for you to appreciate when you see it.

Something that struck me as exceptional about this production (if anything could add to such exquisite music, singing and acting!) was the stage direction for Zerbinetta's ""company of burlesque players.""  They constantly give every appearance of having such a good time and enjoying their endless display of slapstick comedy, which is so proper for this half of the opera company.  A more playful, tender, and ""always fun"" troupe you won't find anywhere.  As Harlequin and Zerbinetta exclaim:  ""What a magic wonderland!""  Perhaps it's all summed up in a gesture by Deborah Voight at her bows following the concert:  her facial expression and gesture seemed to say, ""Wasn't this a great opera!!?""",1291161600,16,2020,5.094512195121951
4194868,5,B003UC49XO,"THIS IS A GREAT OPERA WITH NATALIE DESSAY.  AFTER I HAD REVIEWED IT I INVITED OUR NATALIE DESSAY FAN CLUB TO LUNCHEON.  WE WATCHED THE FIRST ACT, THEN LUNCHED, THEN WATCHED THE SECOND ACT.  THE PLOT IS VERY WELL EXPLAINED IN THE FIRST ACT.  THERE IS A LOT OF HUMOR AND THE MUSIC IS LOVELY.  THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE ""TROUSER ROLL"" OF THE ""COMPOSER""  SUNG BY A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN PRETENDING TO BE A MAN.",1291075200,2,411,4.205128205128205
4194869,3,B003UC49XO,"Since it is not possible to rate performances individually (in which case I would rate Dessay's Zerbinetta five stars), and there are too many negatives (personal preferences) for me to rate the overall performance other than the three stars. Moshinsky's production is adequate in the Prologue and almost non-existent in the opera proper. The conceit of 18th century staging of classical myths in the dress of the time is not a new one. Perhaps it does Ms. Voigt a favor, but I would like to think that she could have been costumed more appropriately in the similar setting that is used in the the film from the Vienna State Opera. She is not the most gifted of singing actresses (perhaps the weight loss has made a difference) moving by the numbers and gesturing in a manner that seems (to me) artificial and contrived. As to the singing I have to admit that I never counted myself in her camp,  but her delivery of the two arias is quite stunning and she easily rises to the challenge. I wonder if she could sing them as well today? Her tenor is quite un-god like, barking and in general singing with little or no distinction. The role is difficult, not too long, but it does require a heldentenor with a good top. It is not uncommon to farm it out to tenors who simply take it on as a job. The one time they didn't was the recording (live) that celebrated the birthday of Strauss: the tenor was Max Lorenz. Alas no one has met that standard set in war time Austria. The rest of the cast was pretty good too!

The real star is Dessay, pre vocal difficulties. While in essence I would prefer a German trainied voice (Streich, et. al.) Dessay is quite brilliant, negotiating all the difficulties vocal and otherwise that Strauss wrote. In addition she is so comfortable on the stage that even if her singing weren't as good as it is she would steal the evening. I have admit that I prefer her to the reigning Zerbinetta of the last thiry years, Gruberova. Again, personal preference.

In a number of recordings the singer chosen to sing the Composer can be mentioned in the same sentence as the Prima Donna/Ariadne and Zerbinetta. Those were the days when we had Seefried, Jurinac and Zylys Gara. Today mezzos have taken over the role; it doesn't lie that high and a good lyric mezzo should have no strain with top notes. Susanne Mentzer sings the role well, but one only has to hear Seefried (either recording) and Jurinac to hear (and in the case of Juriniac) and see the difference. She does give a good performance and has clearly has thrown herself in the role. As compared with the others currently available in DVD she can be rated very highly.

Among the four sets I have, my own personal preference is for the Zurich performance with Emily Magee. She comes closer to to my ideal Ariadne (Cebotari) than any other soprano, combining a radiant soprano voice, great beauty and technique. I will admit that the production is doubtless too outre for most auditors, especially if only one DVD is to be had. Additionally the Bacchus, Roberto Sacca, is only marginally superior to Marginson vocally and carrying far fewer pounds--a visual advantage. The Zerbinetta is the house soprano who will make her Met debut this year, Mosuc. She is several light years from Dessay and Gruberova. Had the Janowitz version been a live performance it doubtless would be the main contender, but it is hardly fair to compare a film with live performances. The Dresden performance should not be overlooked; it afterall was one of the houses that used to compete for Strauss premiers. The Ariadne/Prima Donna, Susan Anthony, is really very good and Sophie Koch another mezzo an excellent Composer. The Zerbinetta is workmanlike and she negotiates the difficulties adequately if not memorably. Colin Davis in a repertroire that one doesn't usually associate with him has the measure of the score.

Given the options for the  opera lover who wants an Ariadne in their collection I suspect that this current set will satisfy their needs. Only a curmugeon such as myself will be bothered by objections I have noted.",1286064000,16,4095,4.704323570432357
4194870,5,B003UC49XO,This is a brilliant performance of Ariadne auf Naxos. Natalie Dessay and Deborah Voigt are two of my favorite sopranos of all time. This DVD recording brings the opera to life. An unforgettable performance by all!!,1284681600,7,214,4.972222222222222

8405803,3,B003UC49XO,"Singing-wise, it's good. But I don't like the colors of the costumes. They are dull, not appealing to the eye.",1468972800,,110,4.55
8405804,4,B003UC49XO,"This is, at best, a difficult opera to properly perform. I guess thats why we don't see much of it. Essentially, its a play within a play, somewhat like Pagliacci, inclusive of the clowns. In the last act, we see traces of Fliegende Hollnder, while, at the end, we see an almost identical finale in Lohengrin.

 This is a romantic opera, about a young woman, who, after losing her love, pines away, on a desert island, awaiting salvation, death or a white knight rescue. The individual, who contracted it, to be performed, at his dinner party, as after-dinner entertainment, as a serious story, to be followed, by slapstick, clown entertainment, has changed his mind, then decides that the comic entertainment and the opera are to be performed simultaneously. The two, incongruent, theatrical companies are left, to work that problem out, with no more than a half hours notice.

 In this presentation, the blend is exquisitely handled.

 Why, then, do I give this performance only a 4? The performance does have one significant problem. Deborah Voigts age and substantial girth do not make her believable, as the young, distressed Ariadne. On top of that, her voice is not up to the part. There are moments, when one can physically feel, not just hear, her failure to hit or hold the proper notes.

 On the other hand, Natalie Dessay, as Zerbinetta, steals the vocal show, perfectly hitting every note and providing the true sonic aesthetic of this opera.

 Is this a keeper? Yes but Dessay would have been a much better Ariadne, with another, young soprano, as Zerbinetta.",1463961600,,1573,4.879699248120301

The images are clear and the sound excellent.  The costuming seems very traditional and clearly delineates the various roles and helps differentiate the two sets of actors that otherwise can be very confusing.  The production was lots of fun.",1428192000,,461,5.202702702702703
8405808,4,B003UC49XO,"Deborah Voigt was the finest Ariadne I've ever seen and heard, and this DVD captures her performance very well. When she pulls out the stops in ""Es gibt ein Reich"" it's thrilling. Natalie Dessay is a splendid Zerbinetta, convincing and able to do just about anything while singing her long difficult aria. I've heard the part better sung, but as a complete performance hers is dazzling. It was a pleasure to hear, and of course to see, the young Nathan Gunn as Harlekin. His carryings on with Dessay are rather more explicit sexually than I remember from live performances in the house, but I'm not complaining. Margisson deals pretty well with Bacchus's music, but the part demands a real heldentenor. I wish James Levine had moved the final scene between Ariadne and Bacchus along better, but as usual he mostly beats time (and gets brilliant playing from the Met orchestra).",1405987200,2,877,4.8533333333333335
