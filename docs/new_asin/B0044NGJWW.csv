8416229,4,B0044NGJWW,"This boxset is pretty rad. Although I think The cook the Thief his Wife and her Lover should have been included over Prospero's Books. Anyway these movie are gems and I am very happy to finally have them. One thing I really wish is that these had subtitles for the hard of hearing in english. I am partially deaf and always enjoy subtitles, but you can't have everything. Wonderful movies. Quirky documentary.",1390435200,,409,4.694444444444445
8416230,5,B0044NGJWW,"An excellent collection of Greenaway's films and the only quality DVD available of ""Prospero's Books.""  (The US DVD is a poor transfer from a VHS tape.)

The DVD is region 0, so even though it is in PAL format and will not play on TV from a DVD player (unless it is a multi-format player), it should play just fine from your computer and you can rip the DVD with HandBrake to play on your TV through an Apple TV (or similar device).

This entire collection deserves to be brought out on Blu-Ray in the US and Canada.",1386979200,2,516,4.244897959183674
8416231,4,B0044NGJWW,"This is a fine sampler set of Peter Greenaway movies. The quality is very good, but make sure one has a region free player. I have tried all of the films on a number of machines and only ""8 1/2 Women"", which is listed as ALL region, plays on my North American players. There are three other movies (The Baby of Macon,The Pillow Book, and Prospero's Books) that are listed as ALL region on the back cover, but none of these played on any of my machines except for my region free player. The ""Peter Greenaway"" documentary also only played on the region free player even though the back cover lists it as ALL region. ""Drowning By Numbers"", ""A Zed and Two Noughts"", and ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" are all region 4 and so definitely won't play on North American DVD players. All of these movies played on my computer, though I had to change the region of my computer for the three Region 4 discs before they would play.

All of the films are widescreen except for ""The Pillow Book"" which is full screen (1.33:1)

The running times for the films are:
""The Baby of Macon"" 117minutes.
""The Pillow Book"" 121 minutes.
""A Zed and Two Noughts"" 112 minutes.
""Prospero's Books"" 121 minutes.
""8 1/2 Women"" 121 minutes.
""Drowning by Numbers"" 119 minutes.
""The Draughtsman's Contract"" 104 minutes.

Special features are only found on the ""Draughtsman's Contract"" and ""Zed and Two Noughts""",1339718400,11,1373,4.6652892561983474
8416232,4,B0044NGJWW,"I deducted one star for the lack of menus and extras. Some of these are unavailable at any price, and actually are of good video and audio quality. I would love to have Prospero's Books remastered and released on Blu-ray, but what are the odds?",1294617600,3,244,4.444444444444445
8416233,5,B0044NGJWW,"Just received it in the mail today, and can confirm that *at last* Prospero's Books has been put on a proper DVD!  It was beautiful!  Funny CTWL not there, but nice to have the Baby of Macon on DVD now too.  And the Pillow Book.",1288656000,11,228,4.022222222222222
