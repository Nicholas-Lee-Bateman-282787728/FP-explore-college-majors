A beautiful young woman was a former model. She had an accident with her face, but her surgeon friend was able to restore her good looks by using fresh extracts of a pituitary gland from a donor (who did not survive this operation). It only lasts so long, so fresh victims are continually needed. This story tells of their efforts to find and process new donors. One of the proposed donors also has friends who were looking at this wealthy surgeon for their next robbery victim. Who will win this race? The surgeon and his girlfriend are like a pair of serial murderers. Will the pair get their just desserts? This surgeon has a laser machine at home that can do serious damage when it is turned on. Will it turn into a ""deus ex machina"" at the end?

This colorful movie provides background scenes of life in 1960s London and a vacation cottage on the white cliffs of Dover. It is low budget but worth watching. This plot echoes the 1942 horror film ""The Corpse Vanishes"" with Bela Lugosi. It is a variation on the vampire movies where a young woman is sacrificed to give life to another. There are cases where a couple committed murders to gratify their greed or lust. Are there businesses that continually need fresh victims to exploit for their gain?",1331337600,2,1276,4.567685589519651
