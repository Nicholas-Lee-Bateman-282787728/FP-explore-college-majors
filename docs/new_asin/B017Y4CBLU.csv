7538373,5,B017Y4CBLU,"As many of you already know, Mr. Cobb was inspired to launch his project after he read 'The Pioneer Little Europe Prospectus,' which is a free 84 page e-book that can be downloaded on many sites and in a number of nations. It should be said, however, that the adventure in Leith unrolled in a very different way than the book. This is because Mr. Cobb departed from its recommendations, and that's what led to his project's collapse. As such, the drama in Leith can be viewed as a ""how not to do it guide.""

Despite all that, it is well worth noticing that since Leith Mr. Cobb was only seen explaining his views (even if controversial) calmly and with a friendly smile, while his opponents were more interested in burning down buildings and crowing about how tough they are.",1461801600,,775,4.535714285714286
7538374,4,B017Y4CBLU,"This is a feature length documentary filmed in the small North Dakota town of Leith. When I say small I mean there were only 24 inhabitants and one bar. It is the sort of place with dirt roads a slow way of life and a sense of community.

They like to welcome new comers and then one day Craig Cobb moved in and started buying up lots. The recent oil boom in the area had made real estate suddenly more valuable. Cobb though is one of the top (if that is the right word) white supremacists in the USA and probably the world. He and his followers (seemingly recruited in a trailer park sale) decided they would move in enough of his anti Semite and racist mates to be able to take over the town council  through democracy obviously  and then the town would be theirs etc.

This is filmed over a period which saw things coming to a head. It is not an action fest of bad stuff happening but it is alarming at how this could happen. He had flags of all the white countries and this includes the Union Flag (Jack) with a ruddy great swastika stuck in the middle of it. The man has nothing going for him and best bud Kynan Dutton was equally as vile.

This is not a show stopper but it is eminently watchable and tells its story in as balanced a way as it probably could have. There is a lot of profanity and offensive language but it only exemplifies the level of feeling that such people provoke in others. If you are a documentary fan then this is well worth a watch.",1460592000,,1464,4.177304964539007
7538375,5,B017Y4CBLU,great movie. everyone should see it. small little town fights back. don't mess with folks from north Dakota!!!,1458604800,6,110,5.166666666666667
7538376,5,B017Y4CBLU,"In 2015 while attending conferences held for cities in ND we had a chance to see clips and hear from the Mayor of Leith and his wife on what the experience has done to him, their family and the town of Leith. In 2016 we were able to view the documentary and listen to a follow up by the Mayor.  Many questions were asked like how to keep something like this from happening in our towns & cities?  Who to turn to for help?  How someone could have so much hate inside them to terrorize kind friendly people?  How someone could live in a run down building with no running water or sanitation?
While some things have returned to normal the (for lack of a better word) innocence of those involved seems to have been lost and the friendliness of the residents toward strangers has turned somewhat to reserved and suspicious.  It truly saddens me to see the evil that invaded the City of Leith and unfortunately thrives in other areas of the country.  A must see for all but especially if you live in a small or rural community and want to keep this type of event from happening where you live.",1458259200,4,1087,4.330049261083744
7538377,5,B017Y4CBLU,"The same day I received the screener of this DVD from the distributor (First Run Features), the big story on the national news was that Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump was being lambasted for not decrying the head of the Ku Klux Klan. Talk about timing!

This documentary  which will have an appearance on PBSs Independent Lens in April 2016 tells the story of how a white supremacist  Craig Cobb (representing a group similar to the KKK) bought a house (with no running water or toilets) in the small town of Leith, North Dakota  where the population was just 24 residents!  and started to bring in others with his outreach to take over the town. They were threatening, not only the residents of Leith but also neighboring towns.

I love documentaries and Im always fascinated as to how filmmakers can hear about a news story and then follow it along from near the beginning to the conclusion. Thats the case here  though it appears that the two filmmakers actually acquired some footage from Cobb himself. I don't like spoilers so I want tell you how it ends (and it may not how you will expect (it didn't for me).

The 86 minute film is supplemented on the DVD with two deleted scenes  a 4-minute version that appeared on the New York Times Op-Ed website and an interview with attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

There are also English subtitles for the hard of hearing.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8741018,3,B017Y4CBLU,"This is what happens when a couple of insecure nerds on the wrong side of history try to live out their Internet fantasies in the real world, even in a tiny, isolated community like Leith, North Dakota. As you watch, it becomes more and more difficult to take the two White Power Warriors seriously, to the point that their inevitable arrests and subsequent neutering by force of law seems anticlimactic.",1531526400,,404,4.785714285714286
8741019,3,B017Y4CBLU,"Eye opening documentary. Hard right wing idiot moves to a small, out of the way town and buys homes and land. Intention is to move his sick minded friends in and basically create a white haven where they can carry out their right wing garbage unabated. It's funny, in a warped way, but it's also a warning that the biggest threat to this country is these idiots and their hate, fear filled minds.",1518998400,,396,4.438356164383562

8741021,1,B017Y4CBLU,"The man who is allegedly going to take over the town has no running water in his house.  The supply lines for his army appear a bit stretched.

He and his trusty young side-kick -- who appears to be about as dangerous as Charlie Brown -- don't actually do anything much.  Well, they put some signs in the yard.  And run-up a flag.  Yawn.

Then they carry rifles down the street, like they're out hunting or something.  This brings in the law, and it's all over.  The side-kick turns tail and, to save his own skin, rats-out Cobb, who appears in court only to say that he has Asperger's Syndrome and isn't too sure what's going on.

Unless you're interested in seeing a homeless crazy man get put in jail, save your time and money.",1512777600,,730,4.348148148148148
8741022,5,B017Y4CBLU,Scary and I am glad the law helped in putting these scum back in the sewer where they belong.  I think Cobb picked Leith because he thought the one blck man married to a white woman would be an easy target and most people would not want to get involved.  He was wrong.  It was awesome to see how the towns people rose up as one to stamp out hate.,1510876800,,346,3.914285714285714

8741024,5,B017Y4CBLU,"By far the most chilling in the batch turns out to be the documentary WELCOME TO LEITH (2015 / First Run Features / 86m / $24.95 / NR). In 2012 white separatist, Neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier Craig Cobb discovered via Craigs list that there were lots for sale in Leith, South Dakota, and he bought up a number of them. He made one his residence, leased or sold others to fellow bigots and repurposed a creamery to become a meeting place for the National Socialist Party. Cobb and his colleagues would patrol the town carrying rifles and  while they never actually pointed them at anyone  terrorized the inhabitants with their threatening demeanor. They were quite open in their intention to take over the place and make it an all white community; anyone who disagreed (including Leiths sole black resident) might infer from the firearms what their options were.
Cobb and his fellow creeps gave surprising access to filmmakers Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker. The citizens various efforts to retain control of their town are detailed (a very clever solution was found though I won't reveal it here) as are the armed patrols by Cobb and his buddies, never raising their weapons but glaring menacingly at various people. As Ive indicated Leith has had a reasonably happy resolution (some of the racists are still in residence) but Cobb, after an all too brief period of imprisonment, has tried similar takeovers in other northwest areas (though this is not touched on in the film). This documentary offers a scary glimpse at something that could happen just about anywhere in the U.S. This is one documentary that should be seen by everyone.",1506297600,,1654,4.882562277580071
8741025,5,B017Y4CBLU,"Great documentary. Watched this on Netflix last night. Mr. Cobb came from nowhere and took away the peace form an already quite town. Incredible how neo Nazis are similar to Islamic terrorists. They call for blood to be spilled, including their own if needed. Very similar to isis or hamas sending their own cannon fodder to blow themselves or sacrifice themeselves, just to kill innocent women and children that they rationalize in their twisted peanut brains to be ""evil enemy"". Ofcourse they are ultimately cowards as they only attack community centers or other civilian population centers full of unarmed people. Respect to residents of Leith for fighting back and kicking a**.",1496707200,,681,5.1441441441441444
