4237518,3,B00400AQGO,The story-line to this movie was good but they should have emphasized more on the characters on what made them the way that they are. There should have been more following up how girlfriend's boyfriend was an accomplice to how her girl got shot. Lots of things could been added to make this film better. On a scale of 1- 10 I give this a 7.,1293580800,7,340,4.166666666666667

4237520,4,B00400AQGO,"This is a very entertaining adult look at dating and marriage. The film focuses on several women and their relationship drama. The lesson..choose your men wisely, work hard to keep your marriage together and above all support your girlfriends in their time of need. Very interesting. Recommended for fans of relationship dramas.",1486598400,,328,5.326923076923077
4237521,4,B00400AQGO,"This movie is real to life. I enjoyed it quite a bit. What I appreciate most is how the married couple pulled through and stayed together. No marriage is perfect and this movie portrayed what real life couples go through, temptation and all. At the end of the day their love for each other came through. I also appreciated the counseling sessions because there are a lot of single women (and men) who jump to conclusions based on past hurts. At least this young lady is doing something about her issues and the guy she dumped remained opened enough to forgive her and let her back into his life. Very courageous. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of the story lines was incomplete. There was no investigation of who shot one of the main characters. It would have been nice to see that person arrested esp. after we saw who was involved. The movie was only 1.5 hours long so another 30 min would have been enough time to see an arrest and finish that part of the story. Otherwise it was a happy ending for all.",1486252800,2,1024,4.338541666666667

4237543,3,B00400AQGO,It was alright for a low budget film. Acting wasn't the greatest but it wasn't the worst either. I wouldn't refer anyone to purchase it though.
