2806009,4,B000OY9V8E,This movie is pretty good.  I think the whole fire snake thing is a really cool idea for a creature movie.  The creature doesn't always look that good but sometimes it looks really cool.  The other special effects aren't too bad either.  The acting is good and overall I think this movie is worth a view.,1240790400,,304,4.375
2806010,3,B000OY9V8E,"FIRE SERPENT

William Shatner actually created and produced this Sci-Fi channel film and it is surprisingly not that bad for a b movie with a far out there concept. This was a movie I happened to catch on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought ""I think I will buy that when it comes out"", used of course. The fact that it was created by Shatner and was a Sci-Fi flick I could not resist it I had to have it. I have always been a sucker for films such as this; thank the Sci-Fi Channel for keeping hope alive for bad b movies.

This far out there movie is all about balls of fire that some times make their way to earth that just happen to be giant snakes made of............. well fire. Of course the government tries their best to cover this up and apparently for years they have until two very different fire fighters from different generations come together after one of these things makes its way into one of their towns. It is here that a chance meeting between the two develops into the two coming together to take this thing on as well as the government. And speaking of the government naturally there is a loyal yet self thinking agent who is torn between falling in line and following her own judgment. I am absolutely sure you can guess what will happen with her; of course other people come into play to keep things lively [or help with a body count]. This is actually a pretty good movie, better then decent in my mind. In fact it could be one of the better movies put out by the Sci-Fi folks out there in TV land. Sure this movie has a low budget and a far out there idea but that only lends to its charm. Most of the acting is pretty good and the film actually takes its time to build up the characters and the story. The only real problem I have with this movie is the ending, while not a horrible one it still is hard to believe even for this.

All the performances were believable enough and every one really seemed to enjoy what they were doing and believed in the film. Of course being a low budget Sci-fi Channel related release no one on here are ever going to be up for awards at the Oscars, but every one for the most part delivered well enough to please this reviewer. I wouldn't say that this is the best film ever by any means but it may be one of the better and most enjoyable movies I have seen from Sci-Fi.",1222905600,4,2327,4.201342281879195
2806011,4,B000OY9V8E,"When I first read the description, I thought the movie would mainly consist of a large flame creature burning a city while a bunch of firemen and FBI guys frantically tried to come up with different ways to stop it. It didn't sound like the grestest movie idea I'd heard but I was buying a few other creature feature flicks and thought I may as well order something more unusual.

Thankfully, this movie is much better than I expected. The plot had a lot more going on than just  having a creature killing a bunch of people. The central characters were a lot deeper than I expected. It had decent atmosphere when it was needed.

On another note, this is the only work of William Shatner I've ever seen. I can see why people respect him.

Finally, cover art of the title picture is kind of inaccurate. the creature is a lot more visually impressive, but the creature in the movie would have been pretty hard to illustrate.",1203897600,3,921,4.464285714285714
2806012,3,B000OY9V8E,"This movie plays like a episode of outer limits or the twilight zone.
I even think William Shatner had some direction in this film.
Anyway, the film is interesting, the acting is pretty good in most cases,
and the film will keep you interested to the end.
The movie could have earned a 3.5 stars if they would have worked on the
creature's sound effects more.  The creature sounds like a monster from
a 1970 cartoon. Not scary and could have been improved a lot to give
you a bit of the chills when hearing it through your 5.1 system...

2806013,3,B000OY9V8E,"From the bad cover art and the story description I was not expecting a whole lot from this film but the reality was better than the packaging.

Two firefighters have their paths cross after an accident at a forest fire site.  The older firefighter is a fugitive and been declared nuts.  He has ideas about living fire that can think and plan.  The younger firefighter doesn't believe a word of it.  Then the government gets involved as they have been following the older firefighter for years.  Reasonable characters, hidden agendas, and  religious zeal abound in this tale.

This story is mor complex than the packaging suggests.  Occasionally a solar flare will through off a fire creature and sometimes they land on Earth.  This has been going on for a long time.  This film is about tracking the creatures while keeping their existence secret from the public and other Government entities.  All in all the story was quite enjoyable with a decent cast supporting it.  If you like monsters and conspiracy theories you might get a kick out of this one.  Check it out.",1189209600,15,1068,4.7650273224043715
2806034,4,B000OY9V8E,"William Shatner was mixed up in this somehow, requiring his name to be listed twice in the opening credits.  The plot involves fireballs from space.  They somehow survive the trip and land in Minnesota (why do they always seem to end up in the U.S., it's a big world).  Of course this fire has brains, attitude, and a snake-like appearance when it serves its purpose to be seen as such.  Otherwise, it's just this itty-bitty cartoon flame that zips along wherever it pleases.  When it possesses people it gives them fire eyes.  Flame on!  The cast of characters is limited to a fireman (Nicholas Brendon), a former fireman with a grudge (Randolph Mantooth), a sinister Government goon and his squad of villainous henchmen, plus a clueless agent more than willing to do the sinister Government goon's bidding.  In short order the fire becomes a national security threat.  Fortunately, there are idiots aplenty willing to accept that without suspicion.  It isn't long before religious fanaticism is brought into the plot, subverting the course of this movie irrevocably.  Still, it is dopey enough that I found myself enjoying the brainless action and silly premise.",1405555200,2,1164,5.010416666666667

I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it in the mail today and popped it in as soon as I got home. Well, I sat riveted to the screen for the entire movie! It's a Sci-Fi flick so you have to view it from the perspective of how those movies go. I loved the creature and the 'red-eyed' possessed people and the friendship forged by Dutch Fallon (Mantooth) and a younger firefighter. I loved the movie, thought it was very entertaining!

2806041,5,B000OY9V8E,I enjoyed this movie Fire Serpent and or course it also starred Randolph Mantooth in it. He played in Emergency also. This movie was awsome and would recommend this movie to anyone. A friend of mine love it too.,1315872000,2,211,4.435897435897436
2806042,2,B000OY9V8E,"Like most Syfy movies where the name of the monster is the title of the movie, Fire Serpent involves some kind of snake like creature on fire.  It's actually got a dragon-like head made of flames and two flaming tendrils.  It also has the ability to possess people, forcing them to shuffle about in zombie-like fashion with glowing red eyes.  The effect went out of style back in the 70s, so your perspective on Fire Serpent is likely predicated on your opinion of glowing red eyes.

Taking a turn as a villain, our beloved Chakotay (Robert Beltran as Cook) is a government agent turned cultist.  It turns out he's a believer in carrying ""the fire"" from biblical times and that the alien he's hunting, the titular fire serpent, is his key to bringing about the end of the world.  Opposing the serpent and Cook is Jake Relm (Nicholas Brendon), a firefighter and investigative journalist Christina Andrews (tasty Sandrine Holt).  There's also a grizzled old firefighter named Dutch Fallon (Randolph Mantooth) who has a grudge against this particular invader.  He's also part of the organization hunting the aliens, or he was before Cook got all biblical.

I'll give creator William Shanter this much - he never lacks for ideas.  What would normally be a standard monster movie is filled with all sorts of interesting twists and turns.  This is as much a ""don't trust government"" tale as it is ""don't trust fundamentalists"" tale.

The CG is competently rendered, with a few audio effects repeated.  The fact that the serpent can possess people keeps it from becoming a one-note Godzilla-style movie.  The acting isn't particularly good, but then this movie ain't named Fire Shakespeare.

There's lots of dodgy logic as to how to defeat the fire serpent, including some dubious theories about how to put out a fire that I'm not planning to put into practice any time soon. There also is some kind of super HALON-cartridge weapon, continuing the Syfy tradition that all these monster movies must feature a high-tech weapon.  And yes, there's a Fire Serpent cam.

But that said, this is actually an entertaining monster flick.  It's hardly high art, but it's enough to keep you warm for a few hours.",1294012800,4,2193,4.849462365591398
2806043,1,B000OY9V8E,"Just look at that cover...a giant serpent, like a flaming comet with a demon's face. Soliders firing their weapons, desperate to stop the beast. Ah, if only there was a scene in this movie half as exciting.
And that is the rub: this movie is just flat-out boring. I wasn't expecting anything great here; I knew the acting would be spotty at best, the effects weak, the story silly or down right stupid. I have watched plenty of those types of movies in my time - what I'm looking for is to be entertained, and this movie fails to even come close.
I would love to break down the plot for you, but I can't. Because, although I have tried to watch it several times now, I have never finished it. My attention always seems to wander somewhere else. I can tell you this, however - the fire serpent spends 90% of its time ""hidden"" inside of charaters, possesing them, forcing them to do evil. The rest of the time it sits on top of houses and buildings, looking sort of like a flaming silhouette of a dragon, although it's hard to tell. There are a couple of half-way cool moments, like when the serpent grabs a firefighter before blowing up a lunch truck, or when one character (a cop if I remember right) lifts up a car with a flame, but that is all I seem to remember about the movie.
Even though it can be had for only a couple of bucks used, it still isn't worth the price. Skip this one unless you need help getting to sleep.",1269302400,,1425,4.2619926199261995

8187647,4,B000OY9V8E,"""Fire Serpent"" is an unusual creature movie. Created and co-produced by William Shatner, it's an unusual departure from the run of the mill CGI monster films that abound in the direct to video (and cable television) market today. I'm going to be honest: I bought this because when I was a kid my favorite TV show was ""Emergency!"" and Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe were my heroes. I couldn't imagine not seeing a contemporary monster movie with Mantooth as a grizzled and possibly nutty old firefighter taking on a fireball from outer space. Not that this is ""King Lear"", but I was entertained in a fun B-movie kind of way.

The film opens in Minnesota in 1966 where a young firefighter, Dutch Fallon, is the first one to see the fire serpent and survive. In the present day people consider Fallon (Mantooth) off kilter because he's talking about intelligent fire as a sentient (and evil) being. Don't miss the early reveal where he lists a lot of places he's been a firefighter over the last 40 years, including Los Angeles County. After a brief detour reinforcing the stereotype that blonde female reporters are vain, obnoxious, and stupid, Fallon gets caught red-handed setting a brushfire. Is Johnny Gage an arsonist? You won't want to believe so, but he still gets arrested, putting him squarely at odds with the government machine and setting the plot conflict in motion.

At the start of the second act, Fallon starts to befriend a young firefighter named Jake Relm (Nicholas Brendon) who, at first, finds it implausible for fire to be intelligent. (I can see his point.) After a scuffle in which the sheriff is possessed by the fire (the glowing eyes are a giveaway), a car is stolen, and an evil federal agent makes his true colors known, the two firemen from different generations start to grasp the situation they're faced with. The evil Cooke (Robert Beltran) is devoted to the fire with religious fervor and may be the ultimate traitor to the human race, while Fallon clarifies that this fire is from the Old Testament, and explains why he lives by Leviticus 10:1. The bottom line is these fireballs are thrown off from the sun as solar flares, and the government is heavily interested in them, mostly because Cooke wanted to weaponize them. The fire seeks out fuel in mass quantities, particularly oil deposits, nuclear reactors, etc., and after going to a church to pray, Cooke's fanaticism reaches its peak as he heads to a national petroleum reserve pumping station while talking about the apocalypse. Unsurprisingly, Cooke turns out to be the ultimate bad guy (and arsonist) and Fallon dies a hero.

More or less everyone of consequence to the story except Jake and lovely leading lady Christina (Sandrine Holt) die in the inferno in the glass factory next to the petroleum pumping station, but Fallon's Halon gun plays a pivotal part in saving the day...or does it merely delay the inevitable?

I have to admit, for this type of film and budget the fire monster was generally very good; I liked the way it could act with intelligence and change its form like real fire can as a means to an end. My favorite scene was when the fire serpent stole a fire truck to drive it into a tank full of oil: that's visual effects genius right there. The story was more interesting than most of the ridiculous CGI sci-fi monster movies that are a dime a dozen these days, and the acting, while not Oscar-worthy, was better than most in the genre. I enjoyed it, and I recommend it to fans of B-movies or ""Emergency!"" alike.",1511654400,,3530,4.734959349593496
