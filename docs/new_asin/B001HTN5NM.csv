3644444,5,B001HTN5NM,"Great Movie. There should be a blu-ray version also. One of Tony Curtis's best movies, ever. Tony and Piper have perfect chemistry together. I love watching this move over and over and over, etc.",1465430400,,195,4.764705882352941
3644445,4,B001HTN5NM,"the first Tony Curtis film i ever saw with my girlfriend, i remember us both commenting on how handsome he was. Even today there are somme very good looking men in Hollywood but NONE can compare to John Derek, or  Tony curtis
MY OPINION, and i do not think they were gay or bi-sexual, not that that matters,",1448496000,3,307,4.293103448275862
3644446,4,B001HTN5NM,"A delightful romp with Tony Curtis and a very alluring Piper Laurie. The Film is among the best of the genre, and vastly superior to ""Son of Ali Baba"" the couple made shortly after.",1406246400,3,181,4.352941176470588
3644447,5,B001HTN5NM,incredible movie about  arabian stories that I grew up with. The Prince who was a thief was made ijn early fifties but still very entertaining. Has not lost the thrill when I saw it in the 50s',1398816000,3,193,4.216216216216216

3644449,4,B001HTN5NM,"The very first pairing of two of Hollywood's brightest young stars for the period: Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie.

This remains, for me personally, the moment I realized that I was male. As a kid seeing this on tv and Piper... being Piper... well... yahoo! This movie was insane for a young dude. And despite the many years and the tsunami waves of so-called 'adult' entertainment crashing upon my visual doorstep, this cinematic creation stands above and beyond anything sleazy and shocking.

Tony plays handsome Julna, no surprise, a thief per the title. But his true origins are of royalty - he is the legitimate heir to the crown. His past hidden by his adoptive parents who fear the long powerful hand of his uncle, the reigning caliph, striking out from the darkness. The same uncle who planned his assassination as a newborn baby to advance his own prospects to the throne.

So Julna has grown up believing himself the son of a master pinch, and it's a skill he's taken to like a duck to water, happily living the life posing as the son of wealthy merchants. In that modus operandi, the family's biggest score beckons. They've been planning the heist of a lifetime - taking down the Caliph's own treasure trove. The collected fortune of the kingdom held in a vault so secure and well protected as to scare away every five-fingered larcenous bandit in the land.

Or so he thought. The very night he and his crew make their attempt - they catch another thief making her way to the very same treasure.

Playing Teena is oh-so-sweet Piper in one of her very first big screen performances. A truly stunning and incredible beauty with just a touch of elfish sexuality. And I had no idea a human body could even contort that way. Much less a female body. <g>

Having cancelled out each other's efforts - Julna realizes that, by combining skills, they could take the treasure house without anyone knowing it was hit. A superior plan than either original effort since the Caliph wouldn't be sending out his troops to scour the land for thieves if he didn't even know his purse had even been fliched; they could help themselves to whatever they wanted and simply walk away. But a problem has arisen. Teena turns out be an impulsive street hustler with a need to steal bordering on kleptomania. And worse, she's fallen in love with Julna. Unfortunately, the experienced ladies man has no eyes for the ragamuffin, and that only exacerbates the already volatile mix.

Their goal is the Caliph's treasure - and Teena is proving to be uncontrollable and jealous. How this plays out makes for an extremely fun romantic adventure with Piper playing with firecracker spunkiness.

Sadly, this early screen appearance would mark a transition for the young actress. Hollywood has a fearsome and well-earned reputation for devouring young beautiful women; using and abusing until they're finished toying with them or having drained every last bit of energy and spirit from their lithe bodies. And it was much worse then than today, where young actresses are generally protected, strengthened by decades of female empowerment, the easy access of digital recorders and the internet. Back then, you were at the (non-existent) mercy of slimy male producers, predatory executives and twisted directors.

Such was the case for young Piper Laurie. Less than two years later, she was again cast in an Arabian Nights film with Tony Curtis - '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-Ali-Baba/dp/6302884799/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of Ali Baba</a>'. But by the time filming began - completely gone is the whimsical and brightly sexual beauty. Having been through several cycles of the mill, Piper became a hardened and coarser version of herself.

Still, if you enjoy romantic adventures from this period of films, it's highly recommended.

Movie Note: Before she lost that perkiness check out '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Blade/dp/B000HA4WSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Blade</a>' with Piper and Rock Hudson. The movie itself lacked oomph as Rock was clearly unsuited as the swashbuckler type.

And before any smug P.C. would-be white knight thinks that I'm knocking the man because of his sexuality - know this: I thoroughly enjoy and count 'Lover Come Back', 'Send Me No Flowers', 'Seconds' and 'Ice Station Zebra' as favorites. So when I say he wasn't right for the role - I mean he wasn't right for the role. Period.

It's difficult when self-righteousness and arrogance is pounding in one's heart, but try to see the world without hyper-politically-correct spectacles. Keeping an open mind means just that.",1322870400,2,4691,5.172823218997362

3644451,4,B001HTN5NM,"This Arabian Nights film starring the young Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie is not available on DVD in this country. I remembered the movie fondly from 1951
and tried to get a DVD version. This DVD is from Germany and one has a choice between German and English soundtracks. The quality is very good. The only problems are that the DVD is in PAL format and from region 2. This means that it is difficult to play in this country. I just ran it through the DVD player on my MAC, and it worked fine, although I can only change the region code a few times.",1229385600,2,549,4.188679245283019

8309711,4,B001HTN5NM,"Very much a 1950s movie, studio sets ,colourful costumes , goodlooking leads, in fact pure escapism [ why we used to go ""to the pictures"" several times a week - to get away from reality]. I had never seen this particular movie before but was always curious having read various comments --- not all good!. Although I have had to wait sixty years before viewing it I was not disappointed, sure it is of its time but the story was rather good with lots  of humour thrown in and I can see why Mr Curtis became such a big star. The overall quality of the print was excellent, no colour dropouts or fading, the actual colours remained consistent throughout and I could find no fault with the soundtrack.",1474675200,3,697,4.4453125
