8233811,3,B000YQP5B4,"Yes, its dated. Yes it's a silly movie. But I lived in Bogota when it was being made. If you want to know what Colombia was like in the mid 70s, just look at the background shots.",1441929600,,179,3.864864864864865
8233812,1,B000YQP5B4,"It was  blurred. I throw it out. But anyway PR has a little rolle in this film, but it cost a lot of money to get it from overseas, so it is
frustating to received it.",1397520000,,167,3.638888888888889
8233813,1,B000YQP5B4,"i don't even remember if pernell is even in this.  this is a z-movie.  like, destroy it as soon as possible.",1389225600,2,108,4.095238095238095
8233814,1,B000YQP5B4,The picture of Pernell Roberts on this item is NOT even one that is in the video.  Pernell has a little role about two thirds of the way through this film and only for about 6 minutes.  I consider this to be false advertising.  I wouldn't waste money on this as far as having this because Pernell is in it; you can just search for this six minute segment on YouTube!  I had to click on the star ratings and chose one; but I give this a rating of zero stars.,1363219200,7,457,3.989010989010989
