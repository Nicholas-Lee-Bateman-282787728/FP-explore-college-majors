228630,5,6300214338,"This film is truly superb.  Is there a reason why a web sit has not been devoted to so many sound bites, is it because it would be to large for our computers to handle.  From the opening line ""is there a problem,  officer"" to ""could you use your nice stick, officer"" or  ""Hogwash"" and ""would you like me to break somthing else,  NO"".  When you watch it, and you must, see how Ralph and Don's  characters change from one to the other, and back again.  This is also true  to Eddie and Dan, add Jamie Lee Cirtis and this is certainly a true  classic. Superb!",930873600,,555,4.150943396226415

Be aware, there is a lot of profanity and some waste up nudity.  Not sure why they jacked this up to an R, it could have had a much wider viewership and box office take as a PG13.  Not a family movie but a good date night comedy for you and your wife if you can get by the above two areas.  Nice thing about the DVD is you can fast forward.",1517011200,,482,3.722772277227723

228792,4,6300214338,I still love this movie but I think I remember the nostalgia more. It's still a great movie but it's lost some shine from the 80s. Still one of Eddie Murphy's finest pieces of work. Akryod is great as a pompous rich guy but not that funny. The funniest part is the last 30 minutes.

228847,4,6300214338,"Decent movie from the 80's that stars Dan Ackyroid and Eddie Murphy back when both were in a bunch of movies and both were funny.

Not politically correct which is a plus in a comedy film.  Also stars Jamie lee Curtis the scream queen and Activia spokesperson.

The whole premise is an experiment that is character and personality a product of the environment your in or not. In psychology terms nature vs nurture.

If all his money was taken would the rich guy turn into a criminal and if given money and benefits of society would the criminal change his ways.

Of course since it is 1983 there is plenty of juvenile humor to go around although not as over the top as Airplane from the same period.

This comedy reminds me of the films Gene wilder and Richard Pryor started in like silver streak.

Good for a viewing every once in a while but I wouldn't view every month.",1489881600,,872,4.4125
228848,5,6300214338,"It's rare that a movie ""ages so well"".

It still resonates today. Hell, an ""Eddie Murphy/ Trading Places"" Law was passed, prohibiting the type of insider trading that this movie depicts. This is a movie that bridges REAL LIFE; besides a law being passed that was inspired by this movie... One of it's players is NOW a US Senator... But it also bridges much of ""The GOLDEN AGE of Hollywood"" to Modern/ Grittier Hollywood.

This IS a great movie.

Dan Aykroyd/ Eddie Murphy, here is ONE bridge. Founding member and star of SNL... SNL was FAILING and then the NEW generation: Eddie Murphy. Dan playing the consummate ""straight man/ hapless victim"" throughout the film, Eddie Murphy is almost the ""pygmalion"" mythos... Partnered with ""Hollywood ROYALTY"": Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of Tony Curtis) and Denholm Elliott, classically trained British actor.

Playing against their protagonists:  Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche, two very accomplished and respected actors from some of the earliest days of Hollywood and forward. This really IS an amazing film.

John Landis is ""National Lampoon""... Animal House... Blues Brothers... He is ""crude and gritty"", coming from the same Hollywood as Martin Scorsesi, but not serious. And this is not a serious film, this is pure FARCE and is one of the best examples of how to explain... FARCE.This movie IS ludicrous and yet, influenced an ACTUAL LAW. It is ""just on the outside of"" most people's real perception, but this REALLY IS UPPER-UPPER CLASS of OLD MONEY and how they behave.

This is one of the few movies that I refer to as FILM, because that is what this is. It really isn't ""that dated"" at all and everything going on actually still applies today. There are ""insider/ Wall Street Cheats"" and racism is still rampant.",1489276800,2,1762,4.9324324324324325

229468,5,6300214338,"Directed by John Landis (Animal House, American Werewolf in London, Coming to America), Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd's characters are polar opposites in the beginning. This was one of the first movies Dan did after Belushi's death.  Evidenced by Jim Belushi as the New Years Eve Guy in an Ape costume.  Great cast with Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche as the Duke Brothers, and Jamie Lee Curtis as a smart Prostitute (with full topless scenes). Denholm Elliot rounds out the cast with a solid performance as the Butler ""Coleman""  Add Paul Gleason (Breakfast Club) as Clarence Beeks, and you've got great performances and a solid comedy.  Also look for one of the first roles for Giancarlo Esposito in a Jail Cell Scene and the porters played by (Now Senator) Al Franken and Tom Davis.",1485129600,4,780,4.798507462686567

229548,5,6300214338,"""Trading Places"" still remains one of my favorite all-time holiday or any comedy film. With a great cast, Dan Ackroyd (Louis Winthrop) and Eddie Murphy (Billy Ray Valentine) who end up switching places by Randolph and Mortimer Duke brothers (Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy) through circumstances beyond their control. Louis Winthrop is a WASPY uptight arrogant prick who works for the Duke brothers. Billy Ray is an amateur con-man who gets arrested and bailed out by the Duke brothers. The Duke brothers argue about the nature versus nurture debate by using Billy Ray and Louis as guinea pigs in their experiment.

The cast is first rate with Dan Ackroyd, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Lee Curtis (Ophelia) in career-making performances in the early eighties. Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche are classic Hollywood actors from stage and screen. They show up later in ""Coming to America"" as homeless brothers living in New York City. Denholm Elliott CBE played the beloved butler/man, Coleman, servant to Winthrop in his Rittenhouse Square home.

Since I love the city of Philadelphia, this is truly a Philadelphia film even thought they filmed more in New York City during Eddie Murphy's schedule with Saturday Night Live. They did shoot two weeks around the city and recognizable sights like Independence Hall, City Hall, Rittenhouse Square and the Penn Train Station among them. You can't not feel nostalgic about seeing the World Trade Center in New York City.

DVD features behind the scenes with John Landis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Eddie Murphy, Dan Ackroyd, the screenwriters, and costume designer. This film was truly memorable and always entertaining to me. I love to watch from the beginning to see the city's landscape during the winter season before Christmas.",1484784000,,1754,5.125874125874126
229549,5,6300214338,I remember watching this originally when it was released on VHS cassette. I have watched it many times through the years. I hadn't watched it for a while so was glad to see it on Amazon Prime. It's a comedy classic that has stood the test of time. To me it is Eddie Murphy at his best. Entire cast is amazing. Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche icons from the golden age of cinema also are a treat.,1484784000,,392,4.103896103896104

230176,4,6300214338,"Released in 1983 and directed by John Landis, Trading Places is a comedy/drama about a snobbish investor (Dan Aykroyd) and a street con artist (Eddie Murphy) who find their positions reversed due to a bet by two callous millionaires (Ralph Bellamy & Don Ameche). Denholm Elliott plays the main butler while Jamie Lee Curtis appears as a wise, but compassionate hooker.

While Trading Places isn't great, like 1984s Beverly Hills Cop or 1988s Coming to America, its still an amusing dramedy, highlighted by a youthful Aykroyd and a ravishing Curtis. I was surprised to see all the female top-nudity but, then again, it was rated R. That said, its thankfully not over-raunchy. The commentary on the haves and the have-nots is interesting.

The film is overlong at 116 minutes and was shot in Philadelphia, New York City, Newark Penn Station and St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.

All jokes aside, Trading Places is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE films! It's funny, unruly, punny and just plain awesome.

Certainly Ackroyd is a good actor/comedian and Murphy a good actor/comedian and the augmentation of Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche as Randolph and Mortimer Duke did nothing but to raise the bar on the storyline, but it's the storyline itself that bothers me.

Ackroyd plays Louis Winthrop III an investor and Murphy is Billy Ray Valentine, a down-and-out bum/con artist/survivor. As a joke the Duke brothers decide to put on a social experiment using Valentine to replace Winthrop, hence ""trading places"". The rest of the movie deals with Ackroyd whining at every turn as Murphy sucks up the good life. Eventually they join forces to play payback on the Duke brothers.",1466812800,,777,4.886363636363637

This film is based on such manipulation including overtly the lives of the two primary characters.  But it also demonstrates the survival relevance of education and comprehension of what's going on.  Corruption is inevitable in such a situation of idiots marching on ""margin"". The film delves into one of the many forms of corruption in those ""markets"" even though it is generally the ""rule makers"" changing the rules for their own fraudulent benefit who win in the real version.  But the film is a very fun fantasy of ""what if"" the manipulators were to lose for once.",1466121600,,742,5.049180327868853

230831,4,6300214338,"June 2016 - It had been many years since I last watched this 80's classic. (The last time was almost surely on VHS.) It looks beautiful in high definition. Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely STUNNING in every shot. The DP, Robert Payntor (American Werewolf In London) clearly appreciated the beauty of Ms. Curtis.

You also get Eddie Murphy and Dan Ackroyd at their very best alongside the legendary actors Denholm Elliott, Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy and others. The storyline is a variation on an old trope made fresh by the quality of the acting. And, sure the pacing is a little slow compared to more current films, but, it works here because it give these actors a chance to really stretch out.

Fun.",1465948800,9,702,4.653225806451613

231716,5,6300214338,"Classic Comedy from the best SNL members ever part of SNL history. Dan Akroyd plays a ""spoiled rich adult"" so persuasively you do not think Dan Akroyd can ever act like that along with ""the sneaky average bum"" that Eddie Murphy plays is so hilarious. Now reverse those roles and you can just imagine. At the height of 80's bringing such a line between rich and poor was never easy until both find out who switched their lives over the most outrageous and downright greedy bet in history. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a prostitute who nonchalantly finds honesty in her work and sees the honesty in the character she helps get back on his feet. I was born in 1988 and this movie 1985 I believe was  years before I came into world. I loved it. Just like the classic comedies of 80s: Coming to America, The Burbs, etc. Especially around the holidays this movie always comes to mind.",1463961600,,872,4.484276729559748

232138,4,6300214338,"It was funny in 1983 and it is still funny today. Just the fact that Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche play the evil rich capitalist traders should be enough but having Jamie Lee Curtis as the smart and goodhearted prostitute that saves Dan Akroyd makes it better. Also watch for all sorts of smaller roles from now famous people and some bit appearances from then famous people.
It is smart and fun. It has some of the funniest lines ever delivered from the very reserved Denholm Elliot as Coleman the butler.  Good fun all around. ""Looking good Billy Ray"". ""Feeling good Louis.""
A fun goofy comedy in Billy Wilder sense. John Landis did a fine job directing a great cast. Enjoy!",1462320000,,675,4.578512396694215

Maybe it isn't Animal House or Caddyshack, but still should be considered one of the better SNL cast movies with Dan, Eddie, Franken & Davis, and others.  The main punchline for the title did not become clear until the end, and it is poetic justice in the plot.  Perhaps Dan's funniest lead role and Eddie is usually very good including this film.

233128,3,6300214338,"Because the cast, and screwball premise is awesome.  Just for some reason the execution did not resonate with me.  And I found myself bored frequently throughout the film.

Now the actual plot, taking down a successful man, and propping up another in his place as two rich shareholders bet on the outcome, is simple but it works.  Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd do a pretty good job at portraying their particular character stereotypes, as well as the transformations both men go through during the film.  And I totally buy Dan Aykroyd as an unhinged insane man, but that's also because he actually is in real life.

But it seemed to me like a lot of the plot and character development was just a little too paint by numbers.  And the ending just seemed a bit too neat and convenient about wrapping up the plot in a five minute segment.

This is not a bad movie, and I'd say most people would rather like it.  But personally, I was just bored during the parts where I should have been laughing.  So it sits as a through middle of the road kind of movie for me.  I didn't hate watching it, but I don't think I would ever go back to it intentionally.",1457827200,,1146,4.38388625592417

This is the kind of movie where if you've seen it once you've seen it a million times. It has many memorable lines and familiar faces.

Valentine, knowing how the situation will go down, tries to run away from the situation but runs into a country club and ends up on the floor with mega police pointing their guns at him. Meanwhile Ameche and Bellamy hatches an experiment to unknowingly kick Ackroyd in the streets and let Valentine take his place. Well the plans goes as follows, but they didn't realize that they the hunters(Ameche and Bellamy)would have gotten captured by the game(Eddie Murphy), who eavesdropped into their little plan and was able to get a plan started with Winthrop, as well.

Dan Aykroyd was really good and Eddie Murphy has two faces which is very interesting.
I expected someting really funny but this was more like just fun to watch so those who wants to laugh out loud, maybe will dissapointed.
But still the movie is really fun to watch.

Much of the success of this film is due to Eddie Murphy, of course, but still, Ackroyd seems to be acting at a much higher level in this film. There are a few weak points in the script and some bits that seemed cobbled together just to get them at a good ending (the train scene on New Year's eve is what I'm talking about), but overall this is a great film.

233808,5,6300214338,"Few comedies today actually comment on social issues, and even fewer do it without it getting preachy. And almost none give a lesson in high stakes commodities futures trading. And yet somehow, ""Trading Places"" manages to incorporate all these aspects onto the same film reel while splashing unexpected comedy that keeps the entertainment level constantly high. In short, the filmmakers respected their audience enough to inadvertently tell us something about the American social strata, and do it without a documentary.

Even the opening credits hint at the coming confrontation. Scenes of a-day-in-the-life of the moneyed elite inter-spliced with the mundane labor of the working class to the overture of the Marriage of Figaro by Mozart/Da Ponte based on the novel by Beaumarchais. Beaumarchais was a French 18th-century novelist who brought the clashes of the classes to the forefront through his fictions, and this is the essence of ""Trading Places"".

Dan Ackroyd is the young, ambitious, if somewhat naive, Louis Winthorpe III who is a member of the Philadelphia upper crust. He works in the finance department of a commodities brokerage firm run by two Scrooges that would give King Midas a run for his money, Mortimer Duke and Randolph Duke, played with subtle irreverence by two veterans of Hollywood's by-gone era, Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy. When Winthorpe isn't making money through commodities trading, he's smoking pipes with his former Harvard classmates at a gentleman's club reminiscent of the Bohemian Club. You know the kind where the hired help is dressed as if they are going to the opera opening night.

On the other side of the railroad tracks is Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn (Eddie Murphy in one of his all-time best performances), who is a con-artist posing as a crippled Vietnam Veteran. The two literally collide, like the aristocracy and the peasantry in the French revolution, although Valentine is immediately apprehended. The upper class is safe--for the moment.

However, as Valentine is being hauled off to the slammer, Randolph Duke speculates that the African-American Valentine may actually have more smarts than he is given credit. Mortimer Duke, the more bigoted of the two, brushes it off. But Randolph bets that Valentine, given the right environment, could run their company as well as Winthorpe. Simultaneously, Randolph proposes that if Winthorpe were to lose his home, lose his friends, lose his reputation, and lose his freedom, he might resort to criminal behavior. Mortimer Duke doesn't agree that Valentine could run their company and that Winthorpe would become a criminal, so he takes the bet--the usual amount.

Through their influence, the Dukes change the places of Valentine and Winthorpe to see how their lives would turn out. Some of the best scenes are with Murphy trying to understand how he went from being in jail (about to be beat up by other inmates) to residing in a multi-million-dollar home, being employed with a huge salary, and given a butler, played with exaggerated disingenuous humility by the great Denholm Eliot. Valentine can only speculate that the Dukes are gay, and Eliot is his slave.

Simultaneously, Winthorpe is accused of criminal behavior, and loses not just his home but his status among his friends from the club. The only person willing to be his friend now that he has lost everything is a prostitute, Ophelia (Jamie Lee Curtis), who has a heart of gold, but just don't mention that her name is the same as one of the characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet.

A kind of modern-day Prince and the Pauper,with a few contrived moments, and a train sequence that kind of gets ""off track"", but quickly recovers for the climax that involves commodities trading on Wall Street. Outstanding performances by all, outstanding directing and writing. And a few goofy characters that make brief appearances, including Jim Belushi as literally a party animal(following in the footsteps of his late brother John), and Al Franken as a baggage handler that wants to drive the cart. A movie that shows both sides of the railroad tracks. Maybe the best comedy of the 1980's and one of the best of all-time.",1431043200,5,4173,5.101024890190336

233860,5,6300214338,"Best comedy ever!!! Along with Coming to America!! John Landis hit the jackpot with these two movies. I was born in the mid-70's and was only 7 when Trading Places came out.  My dad recorded it off of a free preview of HBO in the 80's. Remember those days? If you had cable, even if it just for a little bit, they would have those free previews of HBO, Cinemax, The Movie Channel and Showtime.  The Disney Channel Too! And that was the best time to buy blank tapes and record every movie the preview showed so you didn't have to sell your kidney to buy the original.  I remember seeing Back to the Future on sale for &79.95!! Insane!!  They didn't sell used copies back then cause nobody could afford to buy the $80 original! Growing up at the time, I remember home video being the coolest thing. My dad bought the family a VCR and it was over. No longer did you need to go to the movies. It was hard to believe that you could watch a movie from a 13"" TV without commercials! Video stores started popping up and that was our thing on Friday nights. I loved going to the video store and renting movies.  We rented everything! When i think back, we watched some of the crappiest movies, but it was fun. It was pure viewing pleasure!! It's so passe now. LOL. Anyway, back to the movie.  Eddie Murphy was huge in the 80's and almost anything he did was magic.  Seeing it as a kid, i didn't understand the humor.  Come to think of it, my dad should have never let my brother and I watch it, but as I got older I started to get it and could not stop quoting lines from it.  Still quote it today. Eddie Murphy broke so many barriers in acting and comedy. Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor laid the foundation and Murphy built a Taj Mahal! At the top of his game, he was the best. Movies like Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places, Coming to America, The Golden Child, and 48 Hours, without him, those movies would have tanked at the box office. In Trading Places he plays a con-man posing as a wounded Vietnam Veteran. He somehow crosses paths with a snobby, rich, business man in Dan Akroyd. Akroyd is great too! He works for 2 even more rich stock brokers in Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy. They own a prestigious firm and employ tons of brokers. Things are going great for Akroyd until he meets Murphy. He has the perfect life, money, a hot fiancee, and even a butler (Denholm Elliot). His bosses also encounter Murphy and suddenly the plot thickens. They divulge a sinister plan to bet on both Akroyd and Murphy and how they can make them trade places. Throw Jamie Lee Curtis into the mix as well. I'll leave it at that for those who have not seen the film. It's just crazy, gut-busting comedy! Pure comic genius from start to finish, not just by Murphy but by much of the cast. A collected effort for sure but with Murphy taking the cake, no doubt.  If you like any of the actors mentioned above, this movie is a must.",1427241600,2,2905,4.2846715328467155

233863,5,6300214338,"Amazing classic comedy with the old time honored theme of ""Poor guy in rich guy's world, rich guy in poor guy's world"".

This fun loving theme has been done many times before including with the Three Stooges, and the Marx Brothers, thus it is enjoyable to see an 80's version replay it all over again. Jamie Lee Curtis was young and gorgeous with foxy demeanor, and both Dan Aykroyd & Eddie Murphy were at their comedic genius prime producing the big laughs.

 As a kid I very much enjoyed watching this, and some times emotional roller coaster of a movie where street hustler Eddie Murphy is transformed into a dignified man of ""proper"" higher ""expensive"" society, & ""upper-crust"" socialite Dan Aykroyd is manipulated and unjustly cast out into the rotting ""Skid Row"" level of American life by two sinister villains Randolph & Mortimer.

Eddie Murphy at his prime had been hilarious and phenomenal.

  Beautiful fun loving, but also street smart, ""Philly"" tart Jamie Lee Curtis stumbles upon a fallen Aykroyd and takes him in out of kindness, and a scheme to earn his stolen money back, while also letting Eddie Murphy in on who is manipulating him.

If you enjoyed this you would probably also like the other SNL related films, ""Caddyshack"", ""Blues Brothers"", ""1941"", ""Ghostbusters"", and Eddie Murphy's triumph comedy ""Coming to America"". In my own personal rating system I would have rated this movie, ""PG-13"" because the material isn't that hard core nor deep enough for ""R"" rating, just too darn silly of a movie.

  Great comedy & romance movie. Two thumbs up and A+",1425859200,,1572,4.850187265917603

234040,5,6300214338,"Great plot, interesting characters, hilarious comedy, highly entertaining.  A ""rags to riches"", ""Prince and the Pauper"" story, this movie not only sheds humor in the class, race, social divides, but also teaches us to be humble when we're ""up"" and never to give up when we're ""down""  So true that some filthy rich people are so stingy and unkind, while some poor folks have a heart of gold.  Is it nature or nurture?  Personal success needs the brains, a little help from family / friends and luck, too.

Blu ray transfer of this movie was amazing.  The movie looks sharp, crisp as if it was shot yesterday.  Beautiful scenes of the World Trade Center towers in their glorious days.  I only saw this movie twice, 30 years apart.  It was just as funny and relevant today as it was in 1985.  Only this time, as an adult, I appreciate it even more with the adult humors and the background of Wall Street.  Notice the double-entendre in the title ""Trading Places"" ( Wall Street is a ""trading"" place in itself ) The first time I saw it on TV, censorship must have edited out all the beautiful ( but brief ) nude scenes of the gorgeous Jamie Lee Curtis.

Eddie Murphy was a big comedy star in the 80s.  Every one of his movies was a hit.  Typical comedies of the 80s are light hearted, mistake of identity.  This movie will leave you with a big smile and happy satisfaction on your face in the end.  Just pure entertainment.  Wonderful cast.

This would be a great movie to watch during the winter, especially around Xmas time ( along with other greats like ""Bad Santa"" "" A Christmas Story"" ""Home Alone"" )  If you like this movie, you might also like ""A Woman in Red"" ( only on Dvd at this time ) with Gene Wilder, or ""Police Academy"".  If you lived through the 80s as an adult, you'll reminiscent the good old days of your younger self and it'll make you happy again.  The memories never die.",1422230400,,1887,4.395953757225434

Also has other talents like a young and beautiful Jamie Lee Curtis.  Kind of silly and corny, but fun.  I enjoyed it more for the 80's flashback hairstyles, clothing and jargon.  This was sort of a favorite when I was a teen in the 80's as I really like both comedians.

This movie has some mild vulgarity, nudity and sexual situations so its probably for 18 and up.  Has some holiday cheer mainly a very funny drunk Santa scene.  Other movies have ""easter eggs"" and references to this film later in the 80's so you can brush up on your film trivia with this one.",1419552000,,703,4.4375

234711,5,6300214338,"Any similarity between this film and the real Wall Street is purely coincidental.
The plot is right out of ancient stories(Prince and the Pauper,etc.)  Here, two wealthy stock brokerage owners make a $1 bet that they could train a complete novice off the street(Eddie Murphy)and have him seamlessly replace a long-groomed and 'properly' educated Dan Akroyd as a broker.  They do anything to bring down Akroyd, including setting him up for a bust and then having Jamie-Lee Curtis entrap him.  They replace him with Murphy who zooms to the top with simple street smarts.
The twist is that Akroyd fights back, researching what caused his downfall and who the heck is Murphy(and how did he rise so fast.)
None of the foregoing can communicate the fine touch that John Landis used to craft this brilliant statement on wealth, greed, class conflict, and the state of Mankind.  This is a wonderful story told in broad, almost comic-book simplicity.
No, Wall Street doesn't run like that, especially now with machine trading.  (In the film, they try to corner the frozen orange juice market--problem being, for everyone who gambled that the frost in Florida would be bad, there would be at least a few...thousand...who gambled the other way.  So, to think two 'nobodies' could stampede their way to a fortune is unlikely.)",1416355200,,1314,4.9771689497716896

234778,1,6300214338,"Two wealthy white (yes I am mentioning race as this movie is partly racist in its message) men in Philadelphia play a ""game"" by using their power and influence to destroy a white employee's wealthy life replacing him with a black homeless man. The game is a ""wager"" for a $1 on if the white man will resort to killing to eat and the black man will straighten up and stop killing/stealing all based upon their environments.

This was a liberal propaganda movie based upon a racist premise--that white people are privileged and therefore can behave appropriately and black people are just victims of the white rich oppressors. ""Of course"" the two rich, whose wealth is exaggerated, white men are ""evil"" and ""cheaters""--that is how they are wealthy. ""Of course"" they got their money from lying and cheating. ""Of course"" they are racists who call blacks ""n******"" (I had to sensor the word as Amazon won't allow it to be published if I didn't even though the word was used in the movie (eye roll). ""Of course"" the black guy who lies and cheats to get handouts on the streets does it because he is a victim of the ""evil white man"". ""Of course"" the black guy gropes women on the streets because he is ""oppressed by the white rich men"". ""Of course"" the white people in the movie, if not evil racists, are to be made fun of as they are so ""white"". ""Of course"" the black man just needs a 5 minute description of the commodities market, not a Harvard education like the liberal white character, and the black guy can make hundreds of millions of dollars because you know . . . he has just been held back all these years.

While the civil rights era message of the early 80s (yes it was still in full swing only 14 years after the voting rights act was passed . . we need those tv and movie role models) was shoved at you, the liberal socialist/communist idealogy is rampant in the movie too--prostitutes are moral women who will nurse you back to health after sharing their apartments with you because . . . you know . . . they are just from ""a small mining town you never heard"" and ""just"" trying to make it in the big cruel city of Philadelphia that the evil rich white men created.

I'm sure with it being the early 1980's people just thought this was all a big comedy and a few laughs. But I'm equally sure that after all these seeds of cynicism, doubt, and anti-white, anti-capitalism that has been planted and spread since people can see this movie for what it really was--liberal propaganda.",1413590400,,2488,4.463736263736264

The only weird thing is seeing the World Trade Center during Winthorpe's quick lesson to Valentine on how the NYSE works. It's even called ""the last bastion to pure capitalism on the face of the planet"". It kind of gave me a chill.

236143,5,6300214338,"""Trading Places"" is a modern version of the classic Prince and Pauper story. Set in Philadelphia (with a lot of familiar scenes for those who live in the city), the story begins when the partners of the Duke & Duke investment firm, Randolph and Mortimer Duke (Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche) make a bet with each other as to whether or not taking a small-time con artist they have just seen on the street (Billy Ray Valentine, played by Eddie Murphy) and giving him the advantages of a prestigious position with the firm will be enough to transform him into a hard-working, upper class investment guru. To complete their experiment, they decide to frame Louis Winthorpe III (Dan Ackroyd), an up-and-coming member of the firm, so they can fire him, destroy his reputation, and essentially render him penniless. The nurture v. nature experiment takes place. Valentine quickly becomes acclimated to the world of high-power investing, while Winthorpe hits bottom.

Hilarious moments abound in this comedy, with some of the scenes being truly memorable. In the end, though, the tables are turned on the Duke brothers, as Valentine and Winthorpe concoct a most ingenious plot to financially destroy the men who treated them as pawns, just so they could have the excitement of making a bet. (The bet, by the way, is for one dollar.)

With great acting by outstanding actors, this movie is a true winner, one that is not only good for a barrel of laughs but also portrays the arrogance of those who feel that their wealth and power gives them the right to treat others as pawns.",1379980800,,1568,4.803703703703704

Anyway, in this film, Dan Aykroyd truely displays his talent as an actor and Eddy Murphy proves that he's not just another comedian making movies.  Personally, I found the talk about stocks just as confusing as Mr. Murphy once claimed to and praise him for keeping that a secret during the film itself.  Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche play very well as brothers who are even more stuck-up than Mr. Aykroyd's character.  Jamie Lee Curtis was fun to watch and Denholm Elliott added his own wit to the plot.  Is it just me or was there a lot of alcohol and/or talk about alcohol whenever he was in a scene?  Whoever had the idea to have the characters live in Philidelphia while the Stock Exchange is (in real life and in this film) in New York City was brilliant.  It was nice to see something so closely associated with the Big Apple play a central role in a film that barely took place in NYC at all and have it all work out perfectly and plausibly.  And come on...how else were they going to be able to include that how scene on the train and the bit about the gorilla?

236170,5,6300214338,"""Trading Places"" is a quirky and social commentary type of film that touches on the nurture versus nature debate. Two affluent, gifted, but calculating brothers  (with the Duke family name) make a bet on whether a man's personality is shaped by their genes or by the socio-economic  class that they are born into. The two men run a multimillion dollar corporation. Devious but shrewd plans are put into place that cause two men to unintentionally swap places (played in a superb fashion by Dan Akroyd and Eddie Murphy).  I also enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis's persuasive performance as a woman named Ophelia who is unconventionally goal oriented and ambitious despite her upbringing.

There's a handful of special edition content to boot, with a ""popup trivia"" feature that is pretty cool - contextual popups of facts and stuff in the movie while it's playing.

There are a couple of scenes that perhaps should have been edited down (or out) for the Special Collector's Edition (the scene where Billy Valentine brings people home from the bar to show off his new wealth), but that's such a minor gripe I feel guilty even mentioning it.

Primarily known as the ""scream queen"" of horror films at that time, her performance as the heart of gold hooker Ophelia is brilliant, and am sure it was a deciding factor in her being cast in Fish Called Wanda. Excellent supporting cast, including Denholm Elliott as the sympathetic butler, and Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche as the ruthless, callous brothers who manipulate Aykroyd and Murphy for the sake of a bet. Ameche steals the show toward the end, and this definitely revitalized his career which culminated in an Oscar win for Cocoon. Well worth the time to view.",1353715200,,726,4.724409448818897

236717,5,6300214338,"Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper has seen many incarnations from Disney to The Simpsons. But none have been as cruel (and funny) and John Landis' Trading Places, which proves just how funny Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy used to be.

Louise Winthorpe III is a spoiled, snobby managing director at the Duke & Duke commodities brokerage. Billy Ray Valentine is a poverty-stricken street hustler. Randolph Duke makes a wager with his brother Mortimer that the men can be successfully swapped . The con is on as Valentine is plucked from the streets and Winthorpe is ungraciously dumped on them. There's loads of fun watching him hit absolute rock bottom while Valentine quickly becomes spoiled and snobby himself.

Jamie Lee Curtis is the hugely-boobed hooker with a heart of gold who takes Winthorpe in while the always brilliant Denholm Elliott is Coleman, the unwilling butler caught up in the Dukes' evil plan. Once all four unravel the scam they team-up to destroy the Dukes.

Trading Places is crammed full of hilarious scenes, great dialogue, and funny cameos. Who cannot resist Eddie Murphy's foreign exchange student disguise or Ackroyd's Lionel Josef. Even the gorilla in the train is a brilliant character.

For those of you who love dark, cruel comedies Trading Places is utterly essential. It may be very 80s, but it never gets old. It's a must see and must have.

The Blu Ray looks great in 1.78:1 1080p with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are precious little interesting extras.",1335916800,16,1486,4.928

Fun -- heroics -- fish-out-of-water -- a lovely ingenue at the heart of things -- the rich take it on the chin -- and the nuevo rich get the happy ending!  With Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd at the top of their acting skills, and surrounded by some of the best supporting characters around (Denholm Elliott, Don Ameche, Ralph Bellamy and the lovely Jaime Lee Curtis) the story doesn't waste any time getting started and proceeds at a good pace.  Let's just say that playing the stock market is not as much fun as these folks make it out to be, but we don't worry over that because we're having too much fun with the characters!  It is clear that John Landis knows how to extricate laughs from just about anyone, and lays the groundwork for one of the best of its era -- the 1980's -- a free-flowing string of unconventional movie making.  This film has slapstick humor, pathos, a grungy Santa, gorillas de-mystified, and unusual financial arrangements.  Mostly though this is a showcase for great comedic acting with a liberal dose of redemption for several of the main characters.  Dan Aykroyd has long been one of my favorite people, be it comedy (like this or Dr. Detroit) or drama (Driving Miss Daisy).  Eddie Murphy has had some great moments (this is surely one of them!) and Jaime Lee Curtis has gone from Scream Queen to comedy and drama equally well (My Girl, True Lies, Grandview USA).  As for those Grand Old Men of the movies and stage, can anyone deny that the talents of Don Amehe (Cocoon) and Ralph Bellamy have the charm, dignity and poise to make anyones' film better?!

236720,3,6300214338,"Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy embark on a buddy film that's not really a buddy film, crossing paths only fleetingly before swapping lifestyles and trying the theory of nature vs. nurture amidst the hustle and bustle of Wall Street. Like the Richard Pryor comedy The Toy, there's a puzzling vein of not-so-subtle racism running through the core of this seemingly straight family comedy, particularly when Aykroyd dons black face in the third act, which is only partially settled at the conclusion. Maybe that's a product of the era in which it was made, though, and it seems somewhat validated, if not approved, by Murphy's close presence in every remotely thorny scene. Otherwise, this is a lightly funny, straight-ahead retread with a few good laughs but no rapid-fire side splitters. Murphy and Aykroyd are both solid as obnoxious stereotypes of the worst their culture has to offer, while Jamie Lee Curtis's turn as the hooker with a head for business challenges convention in different ways.",1327536000,,994,5.067073170731708

Than again, the Black & White 'His girl Friday' is truly a classic that still has the side splitting gold to hurt me every time I watch it!",1239494400,,408,4.1
236874,5,6300214338,"Whatever happened to John Landis, the man who is responsible for such gems as Animal House (1978), The Blues Brothers (1980), An American Werewolf in London (1981), Thriller (1983), Coming to America (1988)? He is desperately needed now when the situation with the comedies in Hollywood could be described as tragically horrible or horrifyingly tragic. Now when I think of it, even his less successful Spies Like Us (1985) and Three Amigos! (1986) were very funny and enjoyable. Landis has also directed nine episodes of the cult TV show, the first Sex and City, Dream On, and believe me, Dream On was fabulous. Of all mentioned films, Trading Places is one of the best, at least for me. I can't count how many times I've seen this funny and clever comedy. Trading Places tells the story of two men who were far from each other in any possible way as yes and no - one Harvard graduate, a successful snobbish commodity broker, the financial wizard with bright future in front of him, and great present that included a stunning fiance, membership in a prestigious exclusive club, and even a butler, a true English gentleman. The other - a black street hustler, a small time drug dealer from the wrong site of the town. What could possibly bring them together and even make them partners out for revenge? You may say the fate or you may say, boredom and intrigues of two very rich, very arrogant, very shameless men - Brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke (Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche), the founders and owners of Philadelphia commodity stock Exchange who liked to make bets to prove their points about nature versus nurture theory and enjoyed watching how other people's reputations, happiness and even lives crumbles in front of them. The brothers were curious to find out what is primary, the environment or heredity in forming a human? What would happen if take a successful, well off man, ruin his reputation and throw him on the street and substitute him with a streetwise petty criminal? How would they adjust and what would they do to survive such unexpected turn of fortune? Well, it sounds rather dramatic but the movie is a masterpiece of comedy. It is not just good; it is timeless comedy that does not show a trace of growing outdated. It is based not only on the comic situations but on the changing characters, their communication, getting together and creating the team that would make revenge sweet, smart, and totally satisfying. The acting of two major players, Dan Aycroyd and Eddie Murphy is marvelous. Santa episode is among the funniest yet poignant I've seen. Just to think of Aycroyd, hiding behind a dirty Santa beard and growling like an angry animal over the smoked salmon that he stole from the Christmas party at his former company and hid on his chest made me laugh hysterically. There is also Jamie Lee Curtis with the legs growing from her ears, beautiful smile, and heart of gold. And she is topless in one of the scenes, too, which only adds to the movie's pleasures. There is the craziest New Year Party on the train that involves drunken James Belucci, a melancholic lovelorn gorilla, the coldblooded villain Clarence Beeks (Paul Gleason) who would become the object of unbearable desire of above mentioned gorilla, and two baggage handlers, marveling over how human the ""gorilla"" appears, and sending two gorillas to Africa in one cell. And there is incredible Denholm Elliott, the loyal butler Coleman to both Louis Winthorpe III (Dan Aykroyd) and Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy). To top it all, there is the greatest (I am sure of it) scene of betting on future trading on the commodities trading floor that involves short-selling orange juice futures and turning an enormous profit for some characters and equally enormous loss for the others. For the life of mine, I can't get the idea but I enjoy the scene tremendously every time I watch this classic. Highly recommended.",1237593600,,3911,4.838805970149254
236875,5,6300214338,The Blu-Ray version of this this classic is great. It's the unedited version with the pop-up fun facts. I'd forgotten how funny this movie is. A terrific cast with a super-funny script and frontal nudity from a 24 yr old Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't hurt either. Definitely recommended.,1232841600,,282,4.895833333333333

236877,4,6300214338,"This was made when Eddie was funny and hungry, before he started collecting pay checks for phoning it in. Compare him here and in Beverly Hills Cop with some of his recent work. Aykroyd and Curtis are fine here also. The director tries to create comedy out of the ""nature vs. nurture"" argument, but the cast hijacks the movie and turns it into a romp.",1232323200,,351,4.415384615384616
236878,5,6300214338,"Sometimes a classic movie is too dated to hold up.  Fortunately that's not the case with Trading Places.  Exceedingly enjoyable all over again and it's refreshing to hear the lines as originally spoken (instead of coming from me, or one of my friends incessantly for the past 25 years; ""I'm a karate man. I bruise on the inside."", ""I'm a #@*%ing gorilla, ya clown!"", etc.).

The extras are fun, too.  Most interesting was how uncomfortable Don Ameche was about doing his line when Randall falls ill on the floor of the commodities exchange (since his delivery is so outrageous).

The hardest part is deciding what the single best moment from the movie is:
- Dan Aykroyd eating salmon through a dirty Santa beard;
- Eddie Murphy looking straight at the camera after hearing the simplistic description of pork bellies (""...bacon, which you might find in a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich.""); or
- Jamie Lee Curtis topless (well, you actually get to see that more than once).

This one is definitely a keeper!",1231804800,2,1012,4.787356321839081
236879,3,6300214338,"I've always liked this movie and remember it as a pleasant surprise when I first saw it in theaters.  It features a standout performance by Eddie Murphy (before he became a star in Beverly Hills Cop), a surprising career saver by Dan Aykroyd, and a brief topless scene that changed the public perception of Jamie Lee Curtis from scream queen to sex goddess.  All this while skewering American classism (this is a film for the 99%)!

As far as the blu-ray specifics go the video, while not spectacular, features a substantial improvement over the standard DVD.  The real problem here appears to be the film itself which, frankly, looks more like it was shot as a TV movie-of-the-week.  The print has really been cleaned up, removing all the scratches, dirt and hair that plagued my previous DVD.  Thankfully there is no evidence of the rampant DNR or edge enhancement that detract from so many older catalog titles.  Overall a solid hi-def upgrade.

On the audio front you get a Dolby Digital 5.1 remaster that sounds both dated and flat.  While this is a dialog heavy film, even the classic R&B tunes in the soundtrack sound both tinny and lacking in low-end.  Even though it's 5.1 it sounds just like stereo.

As far as suppliments go, you get an upgrade from the previous DVD (which had almost nothing) to a set that is still pretty bare bones overall.

Trading Places still holds up as one of the better comedies from its time period. Its class battle is still relevant, its got a fun cast, and big laughs come regularly throughout the film. All in all it is a fairly solid Blu-ray reissue.  While the video is better than expected, the audio is really lacking.

Normally I'd suggest a rental unless you're an avid fan of the film.  But at $8.88 here on Amazon if you like the movie at all you should just pick it up.",1231372800,5,1820,4.556923076923077
236880,4,6300214338,"PLOT
Two bored, ageing millionaires conduct a sadistic social experiment whereby they orchestrate the defrauding and humiliation of one of their company's top executives and replace him with a homeless man. The experiment backfires as their subjects eventually undertake significant personal growth, befriend each other, and exact a fitting, calculated revenge.

REVIEW
Aside perhaps from the 1982 live recording of Eddie Murphy's incredible stand-up routine ""Delirious"", ""Trading Places"" is the premier comedy of the 1980s. It's a cut above other perennial favourites such as ""48 Hours"" (1982), ""Ghostbusters"" (1984), ""Fletch"" (1985), ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"" (1987) and ""Uncle Buck"" (1989).

While there is much to commend, the key to the film's success is the cast of seasoned character actors, including Denholm Elliot, Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche, Paul Gleason and Frank Oz. With the help of these veterans, the young leads (Dan Aykroyd, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Lee Curtis) are able to develop an already brilliant premise into a wealth of hilarious sequences.

Unfortunately, the clarity of some blu-ray discs aren't a whole lot better than standard DVD, so I was hoping for a good transfer, but not expecting great quality.  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  Other than the datedness of the time period the movie was made, the movie itself looks as clear as if it were filmed in HD itself.  ""LOOKING GOOD BILLY RAY!""  and I'm definitely ""FEELING GOOD"" about my purchase.",1228867200,3,613,4.536363636363636
236882,5,6300214338,"This review is for the Blu-Ray release of the 1983 comedy classic ""Trading Places."" If you have not seen this movie yet then you really are missing out and what better way to experience this movie than in 1080p high definition.
I already owned the bare bones DVD release, but did not hesitate to order the Blu-Ray release. The quality is truly incredible with a level of detail that simply blows me awaqy and none of the grain or softness that plagues the inferior DVD version.
Plus we are treated to a wealth of special features to help sweeten the deal. The main special feature is the retrospective featurette ""Insider Trading: The Making of Trading Places"" which runs at 18:28 and includes on-camera interviews with Eddie Murphy, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd and Director John Landis. Tne featurette covers the genesis of the story and the preproduction details (Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor were originally slated to star) and how the success of ""48 Hrs"" brought Murphy to the attention of the producing team.
Serving as a counterpoint is the second featurette ""Trading Stories"" which runs at 7:59. The same people are interviewed on camera as in the first docimentary however in this instance they are all from 1983 as they publicize the movies release.
There is one deleted scene running over a minute with an introduction and optional commentary by Executive Producer George Folsey Jr. It details the theft of the crop report by Clarence Beeks and was essentially dropped for pacing reasons.
Next up is ""Dressing the Part"" which runs at 6:31 and has as its main contributor Costume Designer Deborah Nadoolman. She says that the outfit she is most proud of is the red hooded sweatshirt worn by Eddie Murphy in his first scene. She had Murphy in the bright red outfit and everyone else in shades of gray so as to ensure that Murphy drew the focus of attention.
Since a large portion of the movie deals with the commodities trade the Blu-Ray also includes ""The Trade in Trading Places"" which includes discussion on the commodities exchange and how it works and runs at 5:25.
Perhaps the most quirky special feature is an improvised promo piece for the movie that apparently has spent the last 20+ years sitting in John Landis' garage. It features Aykroyd and Murphy winging it for 4 minutes and it is a riot once they get going.
The one feature this Blu-Ray release is missing is an commentary but the movie does have a Trivia Pop-Up feature. Throughout the movie sometimes interesting, but ultimately useless trivia appears on panels on screen mocked up as (what else) $1 bills.
All in all this is an extremely entertaining way to spend a couple of hours and this Blu-Ray release does the movie proud.",1228780800,45,2709,4.778251599147121

236931,5,6300214338,"This film is the absolute best comedy ever! It may not be the funniest (that probably goes to Tommy Boy - also with Dan Ackroyd - hmm - the burning model car scene makes me laugh until I cry just thinking about it), but for laughs and satisfaction it doesn't get any better. I defy viewers to stop themselves from grinning when Billy Ray explains to the Dukes how Winthorp could ""do this to us after all that we've done for you""! The villains are developed admirably and then knocked down in MORE than fitting fashion (especially the loathsome Clarence Beeks).

I don't personally believe in revenge, but it's hard to feel guilty about the way our heroes turn the tables on the villains in this film - they truly appear to deserve their fates. Besides, who can forget Eddie Murphy's memorable lines ""Is there a problem, officers?"" (with eight guns pointed at his head) or ""It was the Dukes! It was the Dukes"" (while being throttled by Dan Ackroyd)?

The segment on the trading center was pretty good, although I'd hoped the director should have mentioned the fact that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was approached for a location shoot, but turned the studio down because it didn't want any disruptions for its daily operation.  That is why NYMEX was chosen.  Also, there should have been a tribute to Aaron Russo who produced the film.",1211760000,,491,4.879518072289157
236935,4,6300214338,"The Blu-ray ""Looking Good, Feeling Good"" Edition of Trading Places, which has been unavailable, is being rereleased.  It appears to be the very same as before, with the same specs and special features.

The plot of this comedy revolves around a wager between two very rich brothers over nature vs nurture, and specifically whether a rich, successful man and a poor man, if their fortunes were reversed (by ""nurture""), would return to their former places because of their nature.  To find out, they wreck the career and life of one of the most successful employees in their commodities trading firm (Dan Aykroyd), and take in a street hustler (Eddie Murphy) to train to take his place.  (Thus the double meaning of the title.)  While this obviously isn't a sociological study, some of the humor and pathos comes from pointing out ways attitudes are shaped by position, and changes in position.  It's also a romance, with Jamie Lee Curtis playing the hooker with a heart of gold who falls for the fallen man.  And it's a tale of sweet, poetic justice.

Murphy was still fresh in this 1983 film, and Aykroyd and Curtis are also very fun.  The script is clever and maintains its logic, in its funny way.

The special features:

-- ""Insider Trading: The Making of Trading Places"" featurette (18:27)
-- ""Trading Stories"" featurette, interviews with the three main players (7:58)
-- ""Dressing the Part"" featurette (6:30)
-- ""The Trade in Trading Places"" featurette, on how the commodities trading in the movie works (5:24)
-- Industry Promotional Piece, which was used to pitch the movie to theaters (4:17)

237078,4,6300214338,"Dan Aykroyd, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Lee Curtis star in Trading Places, a 1980s comedy about business and the class system that is more thoughtful than you'd think at first glance.

Dan Aykroyd plays Louis Winthorpe III, a well educated, well to do, well looked after businessman. His employers, Duke and Duke (Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche), have provided his house and set him up with a beautiful woman, who he is to marry. Billy Ray Valentine, played by Eddie Murphy, is less fortunate. He's living off the streets, pretending to be blind and crippled, begging for money outside the local gentleman's club. It is at a gentleman's club that Valentine bumps into , literally.  drops his suitcase, Valentine picks it up to hand it back to him, and  has him arrested for theft. For Duke and Duke, who were there at the time, this incident really gets them thinking. Is it breeding that makes you a respectable, ""civilized"" person, or is the environment you are in? They decide to find out, and make a wager. They'll make Winthorpe look like a criminal, take his job and all his wealth away and ruin his relationship. Then, they'll give Valentine everything they took away from Winthorpe.  With the tables turned, will Valentine become a civilized businessman and Winthorpe a homeless criminal?

This film had a really interesting theme, I thought. Does who you were born into determine your behavior, or is it what you surround yourself with. Do people have different faces for different circumstances and groups they end up surrounded by? People certainly seem to in this film. Dan Aykrod's Winthorpe goes from clean cut and confident, to a ragged, beat up, pilfering drinker. Eddie Murphy's Valentine, though keeping a similar personality all the way through, does change when he enters the world of big business. Watch how he curbs his swearing and controls his town of voice with Duke and Duke are around. When he winds up in jail, watch how tough he makes himself out to be to impress the inmates. Jamie Lee Curtis' prostitute is all flirty when she's doing her job, but off duty she can be just as focused and businesslike as the film's tycoons. Even Duke and Duke, who I thought were nice enough to begin with, have a face and attitude they wear for certain situations.

I wasn't expecting it in a comedy about business, but there is a fair few crude parts to the film. There's a few topless ladies about, plus the whole prostitute side of Jamie Lee Curtis' character. There's even this gag about a gorilla (who looks a LOT like the 1970s King Kong) falling in lust with a man in a gorilla suit. Fair bit of swearing too. Didn't really feel necessary, all that. Didn't seem to exactly spring from the plot.

This film is set (and I'm pretty sure it was filmed) in Philadelphia, and I really think they put the surroundings and vibe of the town to good use. You can see the slickness and tradition of the wealthier parts of town, as well as the run down, derelict state of some of the poorer areas. At the end, we get to see a bit of New York too, which was nice.

The scenes in New York are set in the stock exchange, the price of shares a fairly major part of the plot at that point. I don't know much about this kind of business at all, but I did find it all fairly easy to follow. The prices on the big boards are given their own shots, so you can read them, see them going up and down. I can now see what all the fuss stockbrokers make is all about. Actually, the business elements of the film are handled really well. The explanations, though few, make things really easy to understand. I learned something, which is funny.

The actings fairly good. It's interesting seeing Dan Aykroyd trying to act sophisticated, it doesn't look quite right with that face of his, so it makes it funny. Eddie Murphy is his usual self, and Jamie Lee Curtis has a lot of fun dressing up in various outfits. There's a couple of cameos here that are worth pointing out. James Belushi plays a New Years Eve partygoer, while filmmaker and muppeteer Frank Oz plays a jaded police officer. It's a bit strange hearing the voice of Sesame Street's Bert as a policeman, but anyway.

Not much in the way of special features, but I have to say that the sound is pretty good. All the songs, be they classic pop or that synthy 1980s stuff playing the background all sounded warm, yet crisp.

If you're interested in the 1980s, thoughtful comedy, Dan Aykroyd or Eddie Murphy, I recommend you check this film out.",1155168000,,4490,4.551425030978934

237134,5,6300214338,"This is a very funny movie, not least because Eddie Murphy, Dan Ackroyd, and Jamie Lee Curtis give nearly the best performances of their careers.  To me it is one of the classic comedies.  It is built on the ""switching places"" storyline, but with a fresh approach, some terrific characters you never forget (even the minor roles - the big guy who only says, ""Yeah!""), great images (the traders rushing out of the stalls at the sound of the market open bell and the opening title shots contrasting wealth, the working class, and the wretched poor), very good writing, and some fine acting (view Denholm Elliot having to turn Louis away as if he never knew him.  There is some real subtlety in the face, eyes, and voice).

Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche are PERFECT as the Duke brothers.  Paul Gleason does a superb job as Clarence Beeks.  Beeks is all bully, too clever by half, and ends up getting his just desserts along with the Duke brothers.  James Belushi takes a small role and makes a mark for himself in one of his early roles.  This performance is proof of the saying that there aren't small roles, just small actors.  Louis' finance, Penelope, and the other rich friends are nicely overdone and enjoyable as for what they are and are not.

But the movie belongs to Murphy and his brilliant opening scene as the hustler in that cart, when he looks at the camera when they try to explain pork bellies to him, and when he is being choked by Louis and is croaking out, ""It was the Dukes, It was the Dukes!"" To Ackroyd as a perfectly snotty rich kid who spends his days pretending that he is a player.  I particularly like the scene where he is getting the checks signed by the Dukes and he starts off assuming he is in with them because he makes them tons of money, and they dismiss him as if here like any other servant - without a thought.  Ackroyd as Louis registers some real surprised hurt there.  And the classic scene of him in the dirty Santa suit chomping off bites of his filthy beard along with the smoked salmon he stuffed in his coat at the party.  And Jamie Lee Curtis as Ophelia has many memorable scenes.  She always has a sparkle and a sense of humor and vulnerability.  She has the strength to laugh off the hurt she feels when Louis realizes and cruelly and contemptuously says out loud that she is a prostitute.  She is much more than eye candy, though she looks amazing in that opening dress and the bikini at the end and everything in between.

This disk has NO extras.  Just the movie, some alternate language tracks and subtitles, and some choice of sound production.  But no commentary or deleted scenes, or anything else.  Still this is worth having and viewing every now and again just because it is funnier than most (not all) other comedies you are likely to find.

However, it has some uses in business education as well.  If you pay attention you can learn a bit about how to make money by going short high and buying long low.  But don't take any of the trading too seriously.  It really doesn't work that way.  Just enjoy it as a funny movie.",1097884800,2,3079,4.434163701067615
237135,5,6300214338,"John Landis' comedy ""Trading Places"" is a combination of pseudo-intellectual farce, racism, power, nature vs nurture concept, slapstick and some deep look at social distinctions. Though it is a crowd pleaser, it has a good set of actors and is well put together. Eddie Murphy shows his genius here as a street hustler, when he is in prison and someone asks him, ""How come you fought with 10 policemen and got slashed and did not have cuts?"", he replies, ""It is because I am a karate man. A karate man bruises on the inside."" Compared to some of the comedies now like ""Dumb and Dumber"", this is a masterpiece. Every actor starting from Don Ameche, Ralph Bellamy, Delholm Elliot to the smaller actors play their parts very well.

It is sad that Eddie Murphy does not realize his own talent and makes so many bad movies for every good movie of his. I see Shrek, I remember how much I loved him back in 48 Hrs and Trading Places, but when I see Daddy Day-Care or The Haunted Mansion or Pluto Nash or Boomerang or The Distinguished Gentleman, I just want to cry at the waste of his time and mine. His Donkey in Shrek and its sequel are the high end of this, but be warned: Bad Eddie will return in Daddy Day-Camp and The Incredible Shrinking Man. Will he ever grow up?

Though the DVD does not have any special features, I am still glad that I have it. Whenever I am down, I can always pop it in my player and up goes my mood seeing the Dukes and Eddie and Dan shouting about the Haile Saleisee pavelion. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who loves comedy. Despite people complaining about its predictable storyline, the way it is played is superb and cannot be copied.

Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy) and Louis Winthorpe, the Third (Dan Ackroyd) are forced to see how the ""other half"" lives, when the wealthy Duke brothers (Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche - Winthorpe's employers, make a one dollar bet that they can take anybody off the street and make them a commodities broker.  They do so, ruining Winthorpe in the process, and replacing him with Valentine.

Can it work?  And if it does, can Winthorpe get his revenge? This is good comedy.

Ackroyd and Murphy work well together, and make a great comedy team.

Hollywood can't help itself politically.  The scenes of the evil Dukes in their office have pictures of two ex-presidents, which U of C Berkeley have named to the Evil Hit parade of the twentieth century.  Yes....

237189,5,6300214338,"I first saw this film in the theatres in 1983, and I loved it! It is still one of my favorites, one that I can't help but watch whenever it comes on television. I wasn't until I was much older that I understood what a profound social message it gave out. Does someone's surroundings and circumstances influence the type of person they will become? Or is it in the genes whether they succeed or fail? We see the question answered in John Landis' ""Trading Places"". Yes, it's a comedy, one of the funniest of the 1980s. But it also makes you look at something deeper.

The plot focuses on two men: a privileged and successful (but uptight and snobbish) Philadelphia commodities broker, Louis Winthorpe (Dan Ackroyd) and a down and out street hustler, Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy). Through a twist of fate during the Christmas holiday season, these two cross paths and a bet between two elderly but crafty rich brothers, Randolph and Mortimer Duke, played wonderfully by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy (for the insane amount of ONE DOLLAR), will answer the questions posed above. How so? By taking away everything the rich commodities broker worked for (and inherited) with a brilliantly orchestrated scandal where he is publicly humiliated and arrested in front of his peers -- and giving it all to the former street hustler, who blossoms under the guiding hand of the two rich brothers into a respected and efficient executive. Meanwhile, Louis continues to spiral downward after losing his job, home, fiancee, money and friends -- into a world he had never known: jail, poverty, drugs, homelessness and crime -- but one that Billy Ray had been all too familiar with. But little do either men know, that both of their situations were going to be temporary because it was just an ""experiment"".

Jamie Lee Curtis, up until she had done ""Trading Places"", had played in so many slasher movies, she was crowned as queen of that genre. But in this movie she convincingly plays a sexy, good-hearted prostitute who befriends Louis and helps him get back on his feet. Eventually this unlikely couple gets together, and once Louis and Billy Ray team up to get their revenge on the Dukes, the movie gets even better.

The ending is a hilarious tale of revenge and triumph, and if you have never seen this movie (don't see how anyone could've missed this), I urge you to check it out! Non-stop laughs are a guarantee! Excellent, all around.",1055030400,3,2430,4.767220902612826

Eddie Murphy gives the best performance of his film career as Billy Ray Valentine, the homeless man who becomes a Wall Street tycoon--courtesy of the evil, somewhat incestous Duke brothers, played with relish by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy.  Dan Aykroyd is adequate as Louis Winthop III, the callow stock broker whose life is ruined by the Dukes.  As for Ms. Jamie Lee Curtis...well?  If you don't think she pulls off one of the sexiest performances ever put on the screen, then it's your own fault.  Also look for stellar cameos by Jim Belushi, Al Frankin, Tom Davis (obsure ""SNL"" alum), the evil principal from ""The Breakfast Club"", and rock legend Bo Diddley as a pawn shop proprietor (""In Philadelphia, it's worth FIFTY BUCKS."")",1035763200,4,1084,4.961325966850829
237244,4,6300214338,"Unfortunately we can't rate the movie and the DVD realization separately in the number of stars we give.  So we have to do it in the rating.

DVD realization:  Too darn expensive for what you get compared to the VHS version.  Wait until the price goes down, or buy the VHS version and wait for the DVD to come down in price.  The price versus benefit of the DVD over the VHS gets -1 star...yes, negative stars.

The Movie:  All right, maybe not five stars, but as a comedy this movie is absolutely wonderful.  I like comedies that make you think, and this one does.  Filled with irony from the beginning to end, the humor substantially comes from irony.  The movie makes fun of people in high places who, according to this movie, do not think like you and I and clearly have nothing better to do with their time than to manipulate people.

The Story:  Dan Aykroyd is an executive in a New York investment firm.  Clearly intelligent and well-bred, he lives a life style that most of us don't even dream about.  Butler, very expensive home and suits, this guy is living a very high life.  Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche are two brothers who own the investment firm.  One day they see Eddie Murphy in front of skyscraper that houses their offices.  After discussing the opportunities that people get in life, Ralph Bellamy bets Don Ameche that given the right circumstances that Eddie Murphy could have been Dan Aykroyd.  What follows actually makes you feel sympathetic for Dan Aykroyd, even though he is clearly a snob.

Dan Aykroyd is set up and arrested, fired from his job, and kicked out of his house,  He is completely cut off from the life he knows.  Eddie Murphy is put into Dan Aykroyd's job and house.  Poor Dan really hits a low until Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays a prostitute, takes pity on him and takes him in.

Fortunately for Dan, Eddie Murphy overhears Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche discussing the bet they made in the executive potty, and also using words that are less than flattering.  Eddie realizes that he and Dan have been set up, and goes seeking Dan since Eddie does not plan on being manipulated by these two.

From this point on, the movie gets really good.  Dan, Eddie, Jamie, and Denholm Elliott, Eddie's butler, decide to get revenge on Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche.  Only minimal details from here on out in case you haven't seen the movie yet.  The revenge plot is well set up and executed, all leading to a really uplifting scene in the commodities portion of the New York Stock Exchange.

The movie is generally predictable, but it is the how of the predictability that I was unable to foresee.  People who are in the commodities business will probably scoff at some of the details, but for those of us who are ignorant of commodities, that part is funny and upbeat.

This early Eddie Murphy movie is well-done.  Eddie generally stays away from the four-letter words he seems to use so much in some of his newer movies.  Dan Aykroyd plays a character that at first you revile, and then want to like.  I'll let you discover how Dan's character evolves.

This movie has a fair amount of intelligent humor.  It relies very little on slapstick.  It is one of my favorite comedies that I never seem to get tired of watching.

Enjoy!",1035590400,17,3256,4.530927835051546
237245,5,6300214338,"Eddie Murphy is at the top of his game in Trading Places. This was before his career exploded and he started believing his own hype. Dan Akroyd is hilarious as Louis Winthorp, a pampered, spoiled Ivy League Lawyer who is trying hard to make partner at his firm, Duke & Duke. The Dukes, Randolph (played by Ralph Bellamy) and Mortimer (Don Ameche) are the real scene stealers in this film and provide the plot for the film when Randolph bets his brother Mortimer $1.00 that he can switch Winthorp with any street hood and have him succeed. Heredity or Environment? Well, the results are pee your pants funny. Eddie Murphy's character Billy Ray Valentine is a street wise hustler with an aserbic wit and tongue. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Winthorp's unlikely love interest (she's a prostitute) and she goes topless which is worth the price of admission alone.

Billy Ray Valentine is  street hustler who becomes a commodities broker while Winthorpe Louis III is snobbish white commodities broker becomes a tormented wretched hobo. The guys conducting this dastardly experiment are Randolph and Mortimer Duke (the late actors Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche). Every actor in this film besides Eddie and Dan had something comical to contribute to the film. The film touches on classism tinged with racism, and the lessons people must learn from  walking in each other's shoes for a minute. Aside from Eddie's gut-wrenching funny antics and jokes, Dan Aykroyd was the central focus. Winthorpe Louis III is rich man who had learned what it was like to be less fortunate and underpriviledged.

The story is by no means new (rich boy/poor boy situation-swop scenario) but it comes together very nicely in John Landis'  film. It is pretty much the Eddie Murphy Show, and remains to this day the actor's best all-round performance. Trading Places is also one of John Landis' artistically more successful movies along with Blues Brothers (a film which was partially ruined by butcher-shop editing), and indeed the two are from the same period.
The film is beautifully paced, the casting superb, the camerawork has some very artistic touches. The acting performances? Dan Ackroyd as always turns in an adequate performance, Eddie Murphy shines in the roll as Billy Ray, as does Denholm Elliot as the stiff upper-lipped English butler (what else?). Jamie Lee Curtis adorns the screen with an abundance curves and a brave if not entirely convincing portrayal as the hooker with a heart of gold. But that's just nit-picking.

High on the list is Trading Places, and with good cause. A superb comic cast and (for the most part) original and mature jokes and gags make it among the most popular comedies ever made. The story itself is a classic - a ""scientific experiment"" pitting heredity vs. environment in which a wealthy executive and a petty criminal are made to live each others' lives. Sort of a comedic modern-day The Prince and The Pauper that pokes some much-deserved fun at the upper-upper class, racial stereotypes and the money-driven white collar mindset that characterized the 80s.
