It is great to have some music, and to get a DVD re-lease of these rare treasures, but the re-lease is not good. Some of the sequences of various films, seem really out of order, and the music is not a true score, but only a bunch of public domain classical music.",1371081600,,374,4.0675675675675675

8372464,5,B002L6SLGG,"This seller sent the video ordered within a week after I ordered it and it arrived in great condition.  I work at a museum that covers California history and we decided to convert our old VHS tapes to DVDs.  Not only were the prices reasonable, but the entire process was smooth and professional.  I would definitely use this seller again.  This also replaced items that were lost as well as replace current DVDs.",1341964800,,413,4.616438356164384

8372466,5,B002L6SLGG,"I had never even heard of any of these movies before the amazing invention that is Wikipedia.  I had seen the Wizard of Oz probably 20 times in my life and I love it.  You absolutely must see these 4 also.  I wish I could find the rest that Wikipedia says were made but they seem to not exist.  These four movies make the experience of the Judy Garland feature so much better becuase you get alot of the backstory to where the characters come from and how Oz came to be.

The Land of Oz (1910)
The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914)
The Magic Cloak of Oz (1914)
His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz (1914)",1255651200,2,594,4.086206896551724
8372467,4,B002L6SLGG,"While almost everyone in the U.S. has seen the 1939 version of Frank L. Baum's classic, The Wizard of Oz, there were numerous earlier films made by Baum himself.  Between 1910 and 1914, the four movies on this DVD were made.  The Patchwork Girl of Oz, His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz, The Magic Cloak of Oz & The Wonderful Wizard of Oz were silent films that show a more complete picture of the Emerald City and beyond.

If you love the Wizard of Oz than you have to see these four movies.  Just understand that they are very old and very low quality but for this price, you can't go wrong.",1253577600,,591,4.25
