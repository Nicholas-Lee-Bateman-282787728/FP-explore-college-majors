8287150,1,B0000CABDM,"I can't believe I bought this. What was I thinking? What did I ever egt myself into...? A big loada horrible movies is what it was. Where can I start with the negative comments?-

The Possession of Nurse Sherri: I ahve to admit that it is a bit original of a story, in which a pyromancer is killed, and its soul is resurrected in the body of a Nurse. Blah, blah, blah... An original story, but horrible movie. Bad effects and not very good acting cap it all off. I give it a 4/10, though altogether I could only watch about 30 minutes of it (skipping and fast forwarding a lot). That mainly was spent while I was drumming and not paying attention to it. But it was still to boring to have playing on the TV.

Rock N Roll Frankenstein: the only real decent film in the bunch of 3 DVDs. It's just about a music label owner that lost his big hit star, and needs a new replacement to keep sales up. *yawn* Anyways, he goes to his nephew to try to get help. His nephew has been working with an experimental procedure to resurrect the dead using electricity (stolen from the classic Frankenstein movies) and immature embryos (not blood or something from some stupid little preteens, but baby DNA). Well to shorten things a bit more, he gets his nephew's hemp-smokin' druggie assistant and his friends to go collect body parts from dead rockstars; including the hands of Jimi Hendrix, pieces of Sid Vicious, Elvis Presley's skull (how they ever got it, I will never know), Liberace's *cough* nether region *cough* (which the filmakers probably thought was gonna make the movie funny, but didn't) and so on. When they finally get the monster assembled, he evolves into a fat, singing, rocking homosexual (because of the part he got from Liberace). Well, ""King"" (as they call him), goes through miscellaneous encounters with groupies, gerbils, and confusing end scenes. To end this, the company Shoc-O-Rama cinema thought they were gonna be cool and gory, but ended up making a ""So Bad It's Almost Good"" movie. Though they include strange things such as King questioning his identity, and stupidly ""gory"" scenes with gerbils. Capping this off, I give it a 6/10- cause I actually enjoyed this other than the rancid stuff Shock gave us in the other 2 (3 counting the extra Full-Length movie ""Zombie 90': Extreme Pestilence"" on the Zombie Doom DVD). Also, the DVD comes with some extras that show this was the highest budgetted of the 3, inlcuding 2 music videos and the making of featurette. And to add a bit more, if you're a fan of pointless cussing in dialogue, and corpse fetishes, than you'll love this!

Zombie Doom: Oh, what was I thinking trying to watch this. I heard from a horror site that they gave this a 4/10, but I'd say it aint even worthy of that. It was boring from beginning to end (the parts I watched of it), with inclusions of such random characters as ninjas, and (for no real reason) Zombies. This movie was under-titled Violent Sh*t III: Zombie Doom, so it was ment to revolve around Karl the Butcher. Not having seen the previous installments, this didn't make me even want to think about seeing the others. The basic plot is that 3 guys land on an island, and get kidnapped by Karl's ""malicious"" gang of cardboard clad fighters. Andreas Schnaas tried to make the guys look cool by getting them to carry machetes and fight each other, but ultimately, makes them look like complete idiots. Which, like I said, I think they actually had cardboard covering there faces, which was painted to look like metal. I want tell anymore of the movie, cause there's little I can say without spoiling it, because the basic plot makes up most of the movie. And to make you not want to see this anymore than I ever do [again], the dubbing is so horrible, it makes the movie funny-like.

Zombie 90': Extreme Pestilence: Oh, woa is me for wanting to see this movie. The stupidest and least budgeted of them all, here comes Zombie 90' falling (to bad to say flying) at ya! Watch out! Cause this movie was horrible! Where I can start, because there's so much to whine about. The dubbing was by far worse than Zombie Doom, with one man doing at elast 3 or 4 people's dubbed voice. The effects- moronic, stupid, overall sucky, don't even touch the surface of the amount they tried to make them look real enough. Though, the bad effect were enough to make you want to puke. Anyways, the first effect used in the movie was a group of doctors cutting open a dead patient's/zombie's stomach. It's easy to tell that the stomach outside was clay, and the blood was fake; and to top it, the ""intestine"" were easily noticeable as sausage links. The plot, was just ignorant, with a military plane crashing outside a city, and spilling radioactive stuff everwhere, making people into zombies (wow that's really new). That's all, nothing else to say about it except the boring ending dream sequence. Totally pointless. AVOID THIS AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!
