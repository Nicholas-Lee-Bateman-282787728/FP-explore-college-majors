Jade's English is accented and the enunciation is not precise. But her dvd is fine for the Chinese aspect.

For this DVD, I like the fact that the English word is said, then the word is repeated in Chinese. The word is reinforced once over in English then in Chinese with different pictures. There is also the option of only watching the only English or only Chinese tracks.

The illustrations for each word are more appropriate than some Baby Einstein dvds where there is a mixing of objects and situations. The wind chimes are there in the background and may not be that easy to ignore. But my son isn't bothered by it. He's quite captivated by the pictures and clips and the 'flashing' of the words in both English and Hanyu Pinyin for Chinese. I wish the words were also shown in the Chinese characters though.

This ""Learning Chinese and English Together"" dvd is for building vocabulary, not to make even very simple conversation. The Jade one teaches simple sentences like How are you? I'm fine; What is your name? My name is...; and goodbye (that is all) and some English songs interpersed with Chinese words.

I feel that this dvd is a good start for toddlers from non-Chinese-speaking home. I'm Chinese but we don't speak Mandarin at home. My under-2 son enjoys watching both the Jade and this dvd though. I'm hoping that with the exposure he gets from these dvds, he'll find it easier learning Mandarin when he starts learning it proper. If you are pressed to decide on which dvd to get though, I would recommend this one.",1158192000,9,1727,4.5792880258899675
8061117,2,B0009I7DD0,"My 1 1/2 yr old is half Chinese, so I was very excited about getting this DVD for him. However, I guess I was expecting Baby Einstein type quality, and this is far from that!!! Instead of music playing in the background, there are WIND CHIMES the whole time and it drives my husband and I up the wall. We can hardly watch it! The teaching is pretty good, very simple, which is where you start with little ones, but we can't hardly get past the wind chimes enough to even watch it. I would not buy this if I had it to do over again!",1154044800,2,531,4.018867924528302
8061118,5,B0009I7DD0,"My 3yo, who has no prior exposure to Mandarin Chinese, loves to watch this DVD! The format is simple and even much younger children would find it enjoyable. My 3yo knows all the words in English and has fun repeating the words in Chinese.",1141862400,7,238,4.431818181818182
