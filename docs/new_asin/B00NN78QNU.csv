6673080,5,B00NN78QNU,"This a brilliant sketch show, one of the very finest ever, and probably the best currently on the air, alongside Portlandia. (Key & Peele is strong too but a bit padded with the live audience segments, IMO.)

Kroll takes the Mr. Show aesthetic of tieing the satire / parody / absurdism bits together.  Upping the contemporary appeal is that the visual style is dazzling and diverse, in keeping with the barrage of graphic effects spectacle of modern television (starting with the amazing title sequence riffing on brand logos,) the proverbial ""sound and fury"" that diverts from the soulless content of reality shows, intelligence assaulting advertising, and egomaniacal TV personalities.  (One basic premise shared with Mr. Show is that virtually anyone on television is basically a sham.)  The camera work and editing are frequently insanely manic, with bizarre asides and insert shots incorporating the wtf sensibilities of Wonder Showzen and some Adult Swim such as Tim & Eric (though leagues above T&E and most A.S. shows IMO.)

Also worthy of note is how INCREDIBLE and incredibly bizarre the original background music is.  It is extremely kalaidescopic in style pastiches, with crazy tonal shifts that make the shows surreal quality cinematically transcendent, another sign of Wonder Showzen's spreading influence.  Suffice to say that like the greatest stoner-friendly entertainments, it makes you feel under the influence even if you're stone cold sober.  Kroll takes you through the looking glass - it's that great.

Last but certainly not least, the characters are fantastic in conception and performance.  Kroll really nails contemporary douchebags and airheads (he plays several females in drag.)  His slight height makes it especially funny playing strutting, preening A-males who are clearly compensating for low self esteem with macho bro posturing (in some cases shifting between abhorrent to sympathetically tragic in true millenial generation fashion.)  Hair metal rock stars, hip hop wannabees, gothic magicians, he nails them all.  Like SCTV's Eugene Levy, he's able to effortlessly play nearly any race / nationality.  The reality show parodies are absolutely second to none and will probably never be topped. Also there is great support from the other actors, including the wonderful John Daly, and the hilarious, sexy, and adorable Jenny Slate & a few appearences by the likewise appealing Chelsea Peretti.

If you don't know these names from other comedy projects and stand-up specials, with any justice in the showbiz industry, you will be hearing more about all of them.  With only one more season to go they may not be big stars during the show's initial run, but their skills are so sharp no doubt they are headed for widely acclaimed greatness, just as the cult appeal of this show will likely only increase through exposure on DVD and other platforms.

From Python through SNL, SCTV, Kids in the Hall, The State, Stiller & Mr. Show, & Chappelle Show, Kroll channels the best qualities of all of them, and brings an unprecedentedly savvy sense of visual and sonic production to support the very of-the-moment (and seemingly ahead of its time) brand of satire.  I'll be giving this as Xmas gifts to several comedy fans, and getting one for myself.",1418774400,8,3275,5.193916349809886
6673081,5,B00NN78QNU,"Kroll show is all unique characters. I suppose it's a sketch show. It is more connected/fluid like a Mr. Show episode, but it uses reality tv tropes to string it all together. Really interesting, weird, and of course HILARIOUS!  BLAP!BLAP!BLAP!",1418256000,2,244,5.1

6673091,5,B00NN78QNU,"B. Matson's review of Kroll Show is spot on. I first saw Kroll on Children's Hospital and he was hilarious so I'm glad I found this show. Like the best satire, it is sometimes indistinguishable from the ""reality tv"" it lampoons except it is even more manic and over the top. If you liked ""Jim and Derrick's Spring Break"" you'll like this. Sometimes up to the minute topical humor loses something over time, but Kroll targets entertainment archetypes that are by now so unfortunately ingrained into our collective culture, this show will still be funny many moons from now. I haven't seen a better executed scourging of the current state of tv and celebrity obsessed culture. Very funny stuff.",1441065600,,692,4.823529411764706
