5780236,5,B00D954AGS,"This is like a teen ""Strangers on a Train"" for the 21st century.  It's the first serious movie I've ever seen about a psychopathic internet troll and the big, proud, kind-hearted but somewhat lunk-headed jock whom he manipulates.  Production-wise, it's lean and stripped-down, delivering its chilly scenes with stark effect, with a lot of location shooting at absolutely the scariest-looking Council Flats I have ever seen in a movie.  It's U.K. but you'll hardly notice, accents aren't strong for some reason (not that British accents are bad, I like them a lot, but don't let fear of them keep you away from this one!).",1393545600,,621,4.951923076923077

5780362,3,B00D954AGS,"This film was really hard to watch because it all seemed so convoluted and offensively nuts.. If it wasn't true it wouldn't have had any interest ,though the boys were lovely actors. This true story is just plain shocking! I think the justice system really worked well because of some hard work by the lawyers and the wisdom of the judge.  It really pointed out to the vulnerability of folks using the internet for more than simple things. No one is left unscarred by this film, watchers and participants. I hope the boys can put all the crazy behind them . They must need serious therapy. Schools have turned to requiring kids do everything on the internet now so there's not much escaping it. Soon no one will know how to spell, write cursive,research in the library or think for themselves. Even reading....it's not the same as curling up with a good dogeared book. How will kids learn to think for themselves if their brains are only online? Maybe that's the point. No one has to know or learn anything because it'son the electronics 24/7 and they can choose any old version of the truth without thinking about it.",1465689600,,1118,4.618090452261306

5780376,2,B00D954AGS,I am not a high school kid. Probably more suited to young people. I am way too old for this movie. Good plot but too much kiddie filler in between.,1465171200,,147,3.933333333333333

And I knew absolutely NOTHING about this movie or its story. So I thought I'd give it a try. WOW!!! - good movie with two strong leads. I loved that it kept me guessing all the way thru. I had a number of scenarios going on in my head as the movie unfolded. But I never EVER expected the ending. The fact that this movie is based on truth makes it even more disturbing. After watching it - I did some research and realized it was based on a story from Vanity Fair about the real life drama depicted in the flick. Definitely a good watch!",1464739200,,655,4.0852713178294575

5780418,1,B00D954AGS,Films starts out with immoral couple discussing her posting nude for a porn magazine.

5780421,5,B00D954AGS,This story had me engrossed from the beginning.  It being a true story made it even more interesting.  One of those gems that fly under the radar and didn't get the recognition it deserved.  Referring it to friends for a good watch,1463616000,,231,4.4523809523809526

5780425,5,B00D954AGS,"Talk about a hidden diamond, this movie was spectacular! I began watching out of boredom, I must confess... watching a sixteen year old boy fall in love with an older girl, online, seemed a sad premise. Then enter her abusive boyfriend; the love struck boy is beside himself with worry... things take a very bad turn and the young boy is swept along on an emotional tide fueled by government intrigue. The MI5 agent was unbelievable, I doubted her - how could she goad this teenager on, recruit him to do her bidding to clean up a terrorist cell the girl he loves has some vague connection to. The ending gave a totally unexpected twist; I admit, I was completely surprised by the ending and that is a rarity for me.

The acting was very well done, the setting of the UK was beautiful and remote at the same time. Sound and lighting were spot on, scenes never too dark or bright, music and dialogue always at a proper level to hear every detail without being too loud. This movie had a touch of fantasy, mystery, romance, intrigue, and psychological thrills all wrapped up within a solid package of - wait for it... a movie based on true events. Unbelievable! Two thumbs up from me, and I'll even toss in my dogs sixteen (two dogs *grins*) pads. Truly a must see.",1463529600,2,1263,4.467532467532467
5780426,4,B00D954AGS,"Truly a well-done take on what is supposedly based on true events. With social media, one never really knows that he or she might be biting off more than one should be forced to chew or swallow.

5780430,5,B00D954AGS,"I thought is was great.  Man reading some of these reviews....people are harsh!  What are you even complaining about??? I liked it.  This stuff is real and it happens all the time.  It was well made and the actors were superb.  Boring? No Horror? Action packed? No. Suspenceful drama? YES. But then if you can read and actually read the description before clicking on ""watch now"" you would have known that.",1462924800,,406,4.661971830985915
5780431,4,B00D954AGS,"At first I thought, ""Oh, another B rate movie from England,"" but I was proven wrong. I really enjoyed it. It is one of those movies that what you think is going on really isn't. I would recommend it to anyone who likes thriller or suspense movies, as it is not a horror movie like you would think. I thought it was much better than the reviews that were written. I thought it was very good.",1462838400,,390,4.144736842105263
5780432,5,B00D954AGS,"great movie...I didn't even read past the first sentence in the description, so I didn't even realize it was a true story until the very end and it just made it that much more interesting and gave me more reasons to be extra cautious when dealing with people on the internet",1462838400,,274,4.392156862745098

5780451,4,B00D954AGS,"I didn't expect to like this movie, at all, i needed something to just watch on a snowy day. I ended up being pleasantly surprised. It's well acted, and fairly well written. It was filed under the horror category, but it seemed more along the lines of a thriller.
Boy meets girl online, she is apparently in a witness protection program, and the boy falls for her almost instantly. She asks him to take care of her brother who goes to school with him. So the boy develops a friendship with her brother, and ultimately becomes so obsessed with his sister that he starts to lose his grip on reality.
I do wish that the explanations of things that happened, had a bit more depth and screen time, but i do understand the whole, less is more. It's worth a watch if it's still up on prime!",1456617600,,783,4.333333333333333

5780557,5,B00D954AGS,"There's internet and magazine buzz available to read regarding this movie. It's a simple and distilled version of a true attempted murder that had a huge online context. The storyline basically reveals how the internet can intensify schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive behavior. As it unfolds in Manchester England, typed messages on computer screens begin to reveal a large cast of characters who seem to cause disturbing and violent events to eventually happen in the real world. The viewer is drawn into wondering what is motivating the characters and... if there is really a unifying factor behind them. It's difficult to say more without spoilers. A lot of crimes include odd, illogical, misunderstood emotions and communications. That's been the case throughout human history. But the internet adds new layers of misunderstanding and that's the main message here. Well-conceived and well-acted, it unfolds a very complex story about as simply and step-by-step as can be done in movie-time. I find myself thinking about it a lot because it reveals much about contemporary culture that I didn't grok before.",1417305600,,1114,5.371428571428571

5780559,5,B00D954AGS,"(May contain spoilers) This teen drama goes far beyond the norm. It is chilling and subversive in the portrayal of the main characters. They seem normal if teen drinking is normal, drug use is normal, completely rebellious attitudes are normal, promiscuity is normal, masturbating while your webcam shows all to a complete stranger is normal and that just describes the lead character. The masturbation is not depicted in the movie just strongly hinted at. The two main characters are boys as different as night and day. One is popular, one is not. One is athletic, one is not. One is surrounded by an often ignored support system and one is on his own in spite of having a family.

The main premise surrounds a mystery internet friend and her unusual world influencing the lead character in very negative ways. This impressionable young man listens to no one other than his new internet friend and forsaking all others is led down a path of deception, violence, and loss.

What is really happening results in a shocking conclusion that will leave you feeling very uneasy. This movie is complex, hormone charged, teen angst at its very worst. If you can put up with the vulgar language there are several lessons to be learned by watching it. Parents should watch it first then watch it with their mid to older teenagers.

5780575,4,B00D954AGS,"Wow,...I'm not sure why this movie has flown under the radar, but it REALLY needs to be seen.  I understand why the title is what it is, but I think they should have changed it.  It just doesn't have the ""Hey, I wanna watch this!"" factor.  But hey, It is what it is and the movie speaks for itself!

The film centers around Mark (Jamie Blackley), a charismatic young athlete who is very well liked and is boosting with confidence.  He attends a private school and spends the rest of his time chatting on the computer with Rachel (Jaime Winstone), a troubled young girl that we discover is in witness protection and is dating a psychotic guy, Ryan (James Burrows) that, for some reason or another, is living with her.  During the conversations, she tells Mark that she fears for her brother, John (Toby Regbo).  He's been getting picked on at school and she needs Mark to look after him.  Mark agrees and shortly after becomes friends with John.  During this time, Mark attempts to chat with Rachel again.  However, this time Ryan takes over the keyboard.  He tells Mark that if he ever talks to Rachel again he won't hesitate to kill him and her.  This is when the movie REALLY starts to get interesting because after not hearing from John for a few days, Mark heads to his home to check on him only to discover some alarmingly bad news.

That's as much as I want to give away of the plot because it really needs to be scene.  And as the title states, had it not been based on a true story, I wouldn't have believed it.  Or, at least, I would have thought the writers didn't know how to finish a good story.

The acting is top notch!  It kills me that there as so many good actors and actresses out there that never really get the attention they deserve.  Production, sound, quality,...everything is top of the line in this movie!  My only real complaint is the fact that when they are ""chatting"" online, they NEVER use the proper punctuation, or spelling of letters, or capitalization.  I know,...that sounds like a REALLY dumb thing to be complaining about, but they simple fact that it is such a big part of the movie, it REALLY irritated me.  But again, that actually might have been the way all the messages were written in real life?

Aside from that, I dug everything about the film, itself.  I would have given it a 5 star, but the fact that I only see it as a ""single viewing"" experience, I had to go with a four.
