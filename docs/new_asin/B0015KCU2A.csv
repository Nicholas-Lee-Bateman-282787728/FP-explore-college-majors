The discussion of Jioza (dumplings) and other Mandarin words within the context of clear English is wonderful, making many words more familiar.

Top DVD to assist in building a Mandarin language vocabulary for children aged 5-7 years or perhaps at the beginner stage (actually good for a mummy brain too that can not spend hours studying Mandarin!!).",1210809600,8,489,4.879518072289157

8258838,1,B0015KCU2A,"There are 2 really big complaints I have about this DVD
1) The speakers are not native Chinese speakers (or else incredibly bad at doing voice overs), their pronounciation is all off. In a tonal language, the pronounciation is exceedingly important.
2) Hey, did I mention they are not native speakers? Because while the words they use are indeed Chinese (Mandarin), some of the phrases and when/what they say would never be said by any normal native speaker. Imagine if someone learned English by reading the original Shakespeare. Maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea.

On top of that, there are way too many inconsistencies in the storyline and the production. Some examples:
- The Chinese market has a sign with ""Fruit"" written on it.
- Making the dumplings, the guy has a bottle with ""Soy Sauce"" on the label.
- The opening sequence in the DVD has them in Hong Kong. Where neither Mandarin or Simplified Chinese are in predominant use, something which is use throughout the DVD
- Who is this Grandpa Joss character who is not fully introduced in the episode? Ping Ping calls him Grandpa, but he doesn't treat her like granddaughter and they never elaborate as to whether it is the mother or father's side grandparent. (Very important in Chinese since it is 2 different words! But then, who can blame them for not knowing if they are not native speakers?)

There are many, many other instances. The only thing you get from this is that technically, the written words are correct. That's about it.
It super sucks because there are many other offerings there that are way better.",1320451200,2,1587,4.746376811594203
8258839,5,B0015KCU2A,"This product is definitely for the younger elementary school child, maybe even younger. Of my four children, the younger two - ages 6 and 4 - had no Mandarin exposure and they went for the repetition and did a reasonable job of saying the phrases. The older two - ages 9 and 11- which grew up with a significant exposure to Mandarin seemed to tolerate the repetition but definitely enjoyed the storyline. Even I enjoyed listening to it!",1315094400,,436,4.602564102564102
8258840,5,B0015KCU2A,"Bought the DVD a short while ago and my son (almost 2) loves it.  Fun, engaging and educational for little kids.  It doesn't overwhelm with too much information, but instead offers a flavor of certain aspects of Chinese culture (I can say this having grown up in Hong Kong).  Highly recommended.",1269475200,,295,4.745098039215686
8258841,5,B0015KCU2A,"We got this dvd after my 3.5 yr old so loved Walter and Ping Ping's first adventures on the Great Wall of China. He is adopted from China, but had been of late rebuffing my chinese efforts ""no Chinese, mommy: English!""

We have Little Pim, Baby Learns Chinese, Bao Bei (Early Start Mandarin) and several Mei Mei dvds... which he all liked at one point. My problem now was less a language problem and more an attitude problem... I considered the River Dragon King, but wasn't that into getting yet another intro to colours (the songs shown on their preview video is about red). So I chose Walker and Ping Ping.

Excellent choice. Yes the video is quite short (about 1/2 hr), but the ""go on an adventure, find the three symbols, come back with the magic flute"" formula is a winning one. It is true that there are not a lot of chinese words, but the ones introduced are common and usable vocabulary, vs colors and numbers. The new words are explained in context, characters are shown in flaming writing that goes out in a poof of smoke (nice touch), and pinyin clear and tones shown. Walker's excitement of learning a new language is contagious and my son repeated along with him. The words learned from the first episode are used here to reinforce them, and new words are also continually repeated during the film

The animation is professional and quite beautiful. The songs are catchy (annoyingly so... I walk around humming them). The characters are believable and they don't feel like cutout excuses to teach. And somehow the film manages to impart a lot of information (what is used to write chinese characters) and hints (how to make chopsticks usable for complete beginners) and it still feels like an entertaining animated show episode, and not a lesson.

As a result, my son wanted to watch it again immediately, and as an adult, I was happy to comply. Some have said for ages 5-7, but my son is 3 and I am 46 and we both enjoyed it multiple times. A fun cultural excursion. We can hardly wait for the next in the series.",1251849600,2,2028,4.5479452054794525
8258842,5,B0015KCU2A,"My kids and I just love ""Walker and Ping Ping.""  The emphasis on culture in addition to language is welcomed.  And the songs are just fabulous!  This episode is even better than episode 1.",1246492800,,188,4.470588235294118
8258843,2,B0015KCU2A,"Maybe we're spoiled because we also bought Journeys to the East ""The river dragon King"" for our son but this video was not only short in time but didn't cover nearly enough vocabulary as the river dragon king.

As Walker and PingPing walk around the market there are some many opportunities for teaching Mandarin but they speak in english most the time and translate a handful of words.

I'm very dissapointed in this video.  I highly recommend ""The river dragon king"" from Journeys to the east.

8258844,5,B0015KCU2A,Great DVD.  My 4 yr old really enjoys watching it.  She already picked up words after watching it one time!  Highly recommend.  Wish it was in cantonese too.,1234051200,3,157,4.5
8258845,5,B0015KCU2A,"My daughters, ages 8,6, and 4 are absolutely wild about Walker and Ping Ping. The series features first-class production values, engaging characters and does a wonderful job teaching Chinese language and culture. We can't wait for future releases.

8258846,5,B0015KCU2A,"The second installment of Walker and Ping Ping's adventures is even more entertaining and informative than the first.  The concept of making learning a fun experience has been around for years, but this presentation is the first to genuinely succeed.  We have shared the new episode with many families whose young children began spouting Mandarin within minutes!  And we hope that the next adventure is in production.  If we could give 10 stars, we would.",1222905600,2,455,5.026666666666666
8258847,5,B0015KCU2A,"I have searched far and wide for decent Chinese DVDs for my 5 and 2 yr olds and I have to say that these dvds are the best I've seen so far.  Very modern, catchy tunes, great for a generation brought up on Nick Jr. Doesn't talk down to kids at all and clearly explains Chinese culture.  Not as old fashioned as Muzzy, and more dynamic than Meimei or Jade and captures a wider audience than those simple dvds that just repeat objects/colors in Chinese.  My kids don't speak Chinese so this is perfect for them.  The language section of their website is also excellent for reinforcing each episode.
Really looking forward to the next installment.",1221782400,5,644,4.525862068965517
