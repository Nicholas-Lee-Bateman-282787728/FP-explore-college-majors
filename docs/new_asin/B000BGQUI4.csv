8086448,3,B000BGQUI4,Robert Urich and Peter Strauss are good in their roles but I think they let Peter Strauss get a little too sadistic and I got tired of him very easily - and I usually love whatever Peter Strauss does. Robert Urich turned in another excellent job as the Dad.,1381708800,3,257,4.26530612244898
8086449,4,B000BGQUI4,"It was a good story taken from real life  Most people have heard of this horrible kidnapping  The way that the main characters played each part was very convincing. I think if you don't know anything about what had happen or maybe was too young to have heard the story  The movie does a real good job at telling each step in how this was carried out  Peter Strauss is a delinquent who kidnaps the daughter (Mathis) of a millionaire (Urich) and keeps her closed in some kind of coffin buried on a forest and provides her with water, food and oxygen for 83 hours (from here comes the title).

Everything is very predictable, especially because the story is told by Strauss from jail (in a big flashback). What makes it good is the originality of the kidnapping itself, the way they hide the girl that increases everybody's tension: her family (of course), the cops and even Strauss and his female accomplice (who have a not very good relationship).

Summarizing, a good entertainment, the chance of watching Strauss in a good character and performance, and the joy of watching an early role of that great and very underrated actress called Samantha Mathis.",1355961600,,1154,4.688118811881188
8086450,1,B000BGQUI4,"This is a great movie but the DVD copy looks like a very well worn VHS tape. The color is faded, and blurry. Too bad, they had a good one but sold us garbage.",1197331200,4,158,3.676470588235294
