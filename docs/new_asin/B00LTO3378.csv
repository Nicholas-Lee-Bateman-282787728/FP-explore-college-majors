6505797,5,B00LTO3378,"Jessica is still going, only now she's not just a resident of Cabot's Cove, she is a world renowned author so she gets to travel a bit more.  She's still a pleasure to watch.  So refreshing to watch programming without a lot of violence and sex in every scene.  Jessica is the epitome of a mature lady who is still very smart, pays attention, dresses well, is very active-(she's always jogging or biking or fishing), is courteous to everyone and somehow gets the police to work with her so she can pass on her insights.  Love the series.",1452902400,5,537,4.448979591836735

8668012,5,B00LTO3378,"They finally updated the opening credit sequence to show that Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) had indeed entered the computer age.  The stories are fine, the casting isnt.  They not only continue to rehire the same actors to play the themselves, playing a different character (David Birney for one), they recast a former relative by marriage (Jeff Conaway) to play a shady barkeep.  At this point, only character actor Roy Dotrice has been willing to actually play a character and not himself.
At least they gave the sheriff a new building.
And they depict a couple of graphic hit & run accidents.
What fun!",1506211200,,610,4.902912621359223
