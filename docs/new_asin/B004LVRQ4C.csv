4405148,4,B004LVRQ4C,"SECRET MYSTERIES OF AMERICA: THE UNTOLD HISTORY presents a startling alternative to the textbook history you got in school, examining the behind-the-scenes role played by organizations like the Masons and the Illuminati in developing the structure and the iconography of the United States. Packed with meticulous research and interviews with respected commentators from all sides of the question, this 5-disc Set contains more than 12 Hours of fascinating documentaries.

I am not a Conspiracy theorist and I don't know much about Secret Societies and the Illuminati, but I love a good mystery and I really enjoy watching documentaries about Historical mysteries and Conspiracies. You'll enjoy watching the documentaries you'll find on this DVD Set if, like me, you have a huge passion for History and if you enjoy watching shows like ""Brad Meltzer's Decoded"" and ""Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura"". When I first bought this Set I didn't know what to expect since Madacy often produces terrible DVD sets, but this one is very good. What I like most about this set is the large amount of different topics discussed ( see listing at the end of my review ). Learn more about the Masons and their symbols, the unfinished Pyramid, The National treasure, The Jacobite Rebellion, the House of the Temple Lodge, Aleister Crowley, and so much more. I've learned a lot of things while watching these programs. The documentaries you'll find in this collection are all very well researched and the people interviewed obviously knows what they are talking about. My advice is to not believe EVERYTHING you'll hear while watching this DVD Set and to keep an open mind. If, like me, you buy plenty of DVDs about History, Mysteries, the Paranormal or Conspiracies then this Collection will be a very good addition to your library. Just remember to keep and open mind and to be a little skeptical about some of the claims made in these documentaries ( being a little skeptical never hurts haha ). Here's the full listing, including the time for each chapters. Enjoy ! :)

4405149,5,B004LVRQ4C,"Can't believe the cheap price for this box set.  Excellent packaging in tin box with high quality booklet and high quality holder for all 5 DVDs.  Each of these cost $29 individually.  One correction..this is Full Screen...not Widescreen.

Great series for those who think they know history.  You will quickly realize the US was NOT founded as a Christian nation, and most of our Fouders were not Christian, despite what David Barton tries to assert.  Yet this series is presented from a Christian perspective, but not at all overt or overbearing.  Just factual.  America was ""founded"" by adepts many decades before the New World was even discovered by Europeans.  It's all here from Solon,to Plato, to Francis Bacon, to all the Founders, to Manly Hall to Secret Societies, to FDR, et al's, creepy transformation of the US with occult motives which continues today.  If every American learned this info in school, we wouldn't be in the trouble we're in now.

The information in this series is essential as we approach a time of massive unConstitutional powers and One World Government coming to bear.  I don't know of a more thoroughly researched or more professionally presented source for this info anywhere. Very high production quality for an independent film series...PACKED with information.  This never gets boring, even after 12 hours!

This is an incredible buy.  Many thanks to the filmmakers for making these films in the first place  An amazing series.",1347840000,5,1464,5.0375
