6236869,3,B00HW3L2J6,"A fantastic price, but the case for the first 5 seasons is awkward and the DVDs are hard to get out.  I bought separate cd cases for them and would recommend the same.  One of the DVDs was also damaged, and I didn't see it soon enough to return.  Two others also had minor scratches but it didn't effect them.",1504137600,,309,4.116666666666666
6236870,5,B00HW3L2J6,"I was in the military and stationed overseas during the years this show aired.  I managed to see a few here and there in later years but I wanted to see them all.  I'm halfway through the episodes and can say this is some of the best value for money I've ever gotten.  They were a great team, did all their own stunts, and made the most of the scripts they were given.  Lenny and Squiggy are super too.  The video quality is excellent.  The only negative comment I have is the packaging.  It's exceptionally hard to get the discs out of the hard plastic center inserts they snap in over.  I'm worried about damaging a disc when I take them out.  Watching these shows re-ignited my crush on Cindy Williams.  :-)",1503446400,,710,4.3106060606060606

6236956,4,B00HW3L2J6,"LAVERNE & SHIRLEY: Spun off from creator/producer GARRY MARSHALL 's popular ""back to the fifties"" series HAPPY DAYS, LAVERNE & SHIRLEY centered on the misadventures of two Milwaukee brewery bottle-cappers/best friends, starring his sister PENNY MARSHALL and AMERICAN GRAFFITI discovery CINDY WILLIAMS. The preposterous situations, broad physical comedy, and slap-shtick were reminiscent of LUCY RICARDO and ETHYL MERTZ, with MARSHALL's brassy, tomboyish LAVERNE DEFAZIO playing beautifully off WILLIAMS' straight laced, upbeat SHIRLEY FEENEY. The colorful cast was rounded out by dancer/singer CARMINE ""THE BIG RAGU"" RAGUSA, scene-stealing goofball greasers LENNY & SQUIGGY (the unforgettable MICHAEL MCKEAN and DAVID LANDER), LAVERNE's excitable Pizza Bowl owner Pop FRANK DEFAZIO, and landlady EDNA BABBISH (former MGM starlet BETTY GARRETT). LAVERNE & SHIRLEY provided most of its belly-laughs during the first few seasons, a tantalizing tribute to unabashed female camaraderie that has seldom been matched on the small screen.

The case was broken, the discs were smudged, and the last disc was hella scratched. I was so embarrassed for giving her such a horrible product for her birthday.

6237024,1,B00HW3L2J6,It is so disappointing that the manufacture of this collection and design team of this collection came up with and used such cheap materials and an awful design for the case portion that holds the dvds. I love the cover art on the box n discs but the rest is awful cheap not durable etc. I had this box set that was apart of my original order arrive damaged on outside and broken inside. Then the only replacement Amazon would send me had the same problem. Since they would not send another I ordered from another well known store (that you can shop locally or online) and had the same issue. So this just proves that the manufacture and company releasing this case don't care about the fans of Laverne and Shirley. Its so sad I will never be to watch the series again (well until down the line maybe someone else releases it) :(. The previous releases of this series done on a season by season were even worse than this box set. So I don't even have that option. I wish companies would care again and put the time and money into release good quality items that don't break and get damaged so easily. And i wish all the shipping companies and postal system would handle packages with better care. So would i recommend this product? No unless you don't mind wasting a lot of money and u don't mind lots of damage. Sorry all just honest review.,1448409600,14,1342,4.372

6237087,4,B00HW3L2J6,"I am so happy to have this entire series finally on DVD. And have watched from episode 1 all through and I'm in Season 6 now. I have discovered something on my set not sure if this is an issue on anybody else's. But on Episode 123 from Season 6 ""Malibu Mansion"" which by the way is my favorite episode from the entire series, imagine that. But it's missing like 3-4 minutes of the episode. After Shirley asks Rhonda to stand up and everyone to leave, they have cut the part where Laverne and Shirley are tied up by the bikers that enter the beach house as she is talking and it immediately cuts over to after they cleaned up. I'm kinda upset about this because this episode like I said is my favorite of all of the episodes. I remembered that episode quite well and picked up on that immediately. Check your DVDs to see if it is just mine that was burned that way or perhaps there is a reason that few minutes is cut out of the episode. Not sure. Why couldn't they have done that to ""Born Too Late"" my least favorite episode of all them. That was an awful episode. Boring to me. I really wanted the entire episode of Malibu Mansion too. Oh well! I suppose I can call the manufacturer and ask why that was taken from the disc. Otherwise, totally love this set. Will enjoy it over and over again.",1439424000,7,1294,4.221774193548387

I love that each episode starts with the theme song (I know some series box sets leave that out, or only play it at the beginning of the disc). I really like graphics on the box - so bright and fun! What I don't love is how they executed the packaging. The sleeve insert on my first part of the box set was all warped because it wasn't cut correctly. And the DVDs are all snapped into their part....but that isn't connected to the case. What I'm trying to say is that the DVDs are snapped into their own thing and appear to be attached to the case they are in, but they aren't. I about dropped them all on the floor while flipping to the next disc - oops haha! Overall, it's a nice set. There are even a few discs that have special features.",1436918400,7,818,4.024539877300613

6237112,5,B00HW3L2J6,"This set really does ""make all our dreams come true--for me and you""!  At least as far as fulfilling the wishes of  L&S fans who want a great complete series, in one streamlined package, at an affordable price.  I took a chance and pre-ordered it, since I saw some of the episodes on TV in the last few years and wanted to watch the entire series.  Now I own my favorites and am discovering new ones.  The packaging is a happy surprise--I just don't see how it could have been done any better.  It saves storage space yet still has everything I was hoping for.  I love that the Milwaukee episodes and the California episodes are separate, each in their own plastic cases, making it so easy to find whatever episode you want.  Milwaukee eps are seasons 1-5, California eps are seasons 6-8, clearly printed on the cases.  Not only are the episodes listed on the inside of each plastic case, they're also listed on each DVD...does it get any more user friendly than that?  The episodes I've watched so far seem to be unedited.  If they're edited, it's not much, as far as I can tell.  As I said, I'd only seen them on TV until now, and the TV episodes were heavily edited. These don't seem to be.  The original opening/closing music is intact.  And the picture quality's great.

I wish I knew who to thank.  This set was so thoughtfully and carefully put together, obviously with the fans in mind, making it easy to find whatever episodes you want to watch.  Such a fantastic job!

 The box this series comes in provides an easy way to keep the set together...but what a cool way to design it!  All the icons are there, that make Laverne & Shirley the beloved series that it is.  Lenny and Squiqqy, posing against the backdrop of a bottle cap.  The factory line as the bottles go by (which, after all, is in the opening credits of at least the first couple of seasons).  I love how, in the designs found on the plastic cases, they put Boo Boo Kitty in the center of a flower.  A bowling pin's in the center of the other one.  Laverne & Shirley with the record (Fabian, probably?)  The box isn't nearly as important as the DVD's, and the overall quality of this set, of course. But it's an extra little bonus for loyal fans.  Now, for the DVD's themselves.  It's not a new show, so maybe the DVD's aren't as ""high def"" as some people prefer, but the DVD's are as good as it's possible to get with a series that originally aired in the 70's-80's.  Even better quality than expected.

In my opinion, the only things missing that could have been included with this set, are cast commentaries and the pilot to Laverne & Shirley, which aired as a Happy Days episode.  That was the episode that launched Laverne & Shirley, and this addition would make it perfect.  And I almost forgot to mention that a bonus episode is included!  Apparently, part 2 of ""Shotgun Wedding"" was a L&S episode, while part 1 was a ""Happy Days"" episode.  No worries--they are both included with this set!  Part 1 is the bonus episode.",1434931200,62,3001,4.424131627056672

6237117,2,B00HW3L2J6,"I have always lived this show. It gets five stars (despite 2 weaker seasons sprinkled into the length of the show). But this box art is lame (the box art should make people WANT to buy the product not think twice about it. Plus, the 60's flower motif is mis-placed. While the show did extend into the 60s, those were not the prime years. The show is always thought and described as taking place in the 50s. And if you are going to just use boring, staid pix why not use iconic ones, like from the brewery assembly line (watching the bottles go by) or them riding the bike together?
