8077123,4,B000AA3L60,"This is KISS as rarely seen or heard. A blasting quick-tempoed rock and roll band. Unfortunately both and picture are less than ideal. You can't turn it up because it's just too digitized. It'll sear your ears off - and not in a good way. It's still a great performance and reminds me why I loved KISS in the day. But if you're a KISS fan, pick this up anyway. They never played with the  same ferocious elan as they did in 76. The savage beat was eventually tamed by time, Ezrin and commercialism. I give the DVD a 10 for performance and 2 for DVD quality",1134172800,5,556,4.196261682242991
8077124,5,B000AA3L60,"Seeing the cover of this DVD and reflecting how I've been jipped in the past from lower budget DVD's, I naturally bought this with some trepidation.  This was one gamble that paid off in spades.

First, I find it amusing that since this is the only semi-commercial DVD of the band in its heyday, this is called the ""lost"" concert.  As long as KISS continues to perform today with the makeup, we will only get to see vintage stuff like this in non-endorsed videos and bootlegs.  This concert held July 10, 1976 in Jersey City features 7 songs from the first album up to Destroyer:

1. Cold Gin
2. Do You Love Me
3. Watchin' You
4. God Of Thunder
5. Flaming Youth (first and only time live on video!)
6. Firehouse
7. Black Diamond

The songs are each done with CGI title shots featuring MTV style intros and outros in the bottom corner of the screen.  Shot in black and white, there are alot of light bleeds throughout the show.  So, you'll have to hang tight through that.  The sound quality will more than make up for it.  Also, the menus on this disc are much higher quality than I expected.

The DVD includes a bonus feature of KISS's appearance on the Mike Douglas Show April 29, 1974.  Promoting their first album, Douglas interviews Gene Simmons much to the chagrin of his fellow guests and the delight of the audience.  Seeing Gene totally in character on this show is almost as hilarious as KISS's appearence on the Bob Hope special in 1975.  Rounding it out, KISS performs Firehouse complete with (of course) Gene breathing fire.

Also included as a bonus feature is an instrumental video from a band called The Kieselhorst Experience (I know--I've never heard of them either).  The video is set to a montage of KISS footage from the performance on the Mike Douglas Show to footage from their reunion tour in '96.  Nothing incredible, but a nice touch.

If you're a KISS fan, this is a MUST-HAVE!  Until the band makes their vintage shows commercially available, this is certainly one of the neatest mementos of the band at its best you can pick up.",1126483200,5,2057,4.540760869565218
