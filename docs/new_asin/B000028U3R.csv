1250635,5,B000028U3R,"We live in a small town in Alaska.  My wife was out of town visiting her parents and I was home alone with our five children.  Not much to do for  family entertainment if there is nothing on TV.  Iron Giant was playing at  our theatre and while I was not too excited to go, our kids were thrilled.  I left our twins with a babysitter and took our other three children (ages  9,6 and 4).  They had a great time.  The four-year-old did not think it was  too scarey (he's a boy) and his older sisters thought it was a fun and  exciting movie.  They are dying to get this video and it will make a great  Christmas stocking stuffer.",940982400,3,627,4.082644628099174
1250636,5,B000028U3R,"This movie has something for everyone.  It has a great plot, good character developement, and unbelievable animation.  It deserves a look by anyone who has ever dreamed of things and wished they were true.
The only  shortfall this movie suffered was terrible marketing.  They picked a poor  name for the movie and capped it off with virtually no advertising until 2  days before its release.  This movie should have rivalled any Disney movie  in earnings but WB just didn't get behing the movie.
Fun for all ages  and Highly recommended!!!",940723200,,539,4.9

1250638,5,B000028U3R,"THE IRON GIANT (1999) is so wonderful, so full of magic, so heart-warming, the film is one of the BEST movies (not just animated) to come out in years. Academy, please take note when you cast your ballot. Warner Bros.  did a terrible job in selling this magnificent film in theatres last  summer. Those people who did see THE IRON GIANT were touched by it,  thrilled by it, BLOWN AWAY by it. THE IRON GIANT will live on while other  films like it (TARZAN who?) disappear from memory. Mark my words. THE IRON  GIANT is a MOVIE FOR ALL SEASONS, and ALL PEOPLE. Brad Bird, please take a  bow.",940204800,,589,4.3577981651376145

1250640,5,B000028U3R,"The Warner Bros. marketing machine missed the mark on promoting this 1999 animated classic. Brad Bird and the rest of the production crew deserve more than a standing ovation for the work they did. ""The Iron  Giant"" is a beautiful, eloquent story. From scenes that send  heart-bursting adrenaline through you, to insightful, deep moments between  the all-too-human characters and the robotic lead, ""The Iron  Giant"" is one DVD which will *always* remain in my collection. I hope  Brad Bird & Co. are able to bring more magical animations to the big  screen in the years ahead. I cannot praise this film enough.",938908800,,610,4.931372549019608

  Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Vin Diesel, Christopher McDonald
  Brad Bird (Director)
  MOVIE: ?.?  VIDEO: ?.? (35.2 Mbps)  AUDIO: ?.?

  The first time that I saw this movie was when it initially became available on home-video, back in November of 1999. I thought then (as I do now) that it was VERY refreshing to see an animated movie that did NOT have any of its characters bursting into song. Also, just as pleasing, was the fact that it did NOT have any cute, cuddly talking animals  whose ONLY real purpose for being in the movie is to sell merchandise to kids (yes, I'm looking at you Disney). And, I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that, though it is ostensibly for kids, it is still a very smart movie that didn't insult the intelligence of its viewers.

  By now most people are probably familiar with the story of how this movie  which bombed horribly upon its initial theatrical release in the fall of 1999  has since then gone on to become a highly respected and MUCH beloved cinematic classic. I believe that the reason that this movie is now so well liked is because it can be enjoyed on so many different levels  which is why BOTH adults AND children absolutely love it. Plus, it's just a glorious example of old-school, (mostly) hand-drawn, animation as an art form. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  NOTE: I bought this set for the ""Signature Edition"" version of the movie (since I already had a very serviceable copy of the original ""Theatrical Edition"" on DVD)  therefore, while I sampled portions of the ""Theatrical Edition"" version that is contained in this set (just to make sure that it wasn't defective), I don't have any plans to EVER watch it in its entirety. So, ALL of the following ""video"" and ""audio"" information pertains to the ""Signature Edition"" version ONLY. (But, if I ever do watch ALL of the ""Theatrical Edition"" version, then I'll come back and update this review.)

  See the other reviews on this page for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 2.4:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC

  This movie's image features dazzling, over-saturated colors, sharply rendered panoramic vistas, and very good apparent depth. It also has very good, to frequently excellent, contrast and has very good shadow detail (as seen in the many dark and shadowy areas, such as the night scenes located at the very beginning of the movie, and the dark scenes located in the forest). Also, fine detail is frequently evident in some of the brighter scenes and in the close-ups of the characters. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations (probably because it is an animated feature, which makes extensive use of CGI [which is an observation, and NOT a complaint]). Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has VERY good, to frequently excellent, picture quality  and, should satisfy all but the very pickiest of viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  This is another soundtrack that, if it was a 7.1 mix, I would rate a 5+ for sound quality without hesitation  as it is, it is still one of the very BEST sounding audio presentations that you will ever hear on a home theater system regardless of the number of channels. It has deep bass, very active and highly directional surround channels, clear well-placed dialog, ambient sounds that effectively convey the on-screen environment, and some of the best recorded music that I have ever heard in a film's soundtrack. This is an outstanding soundtrack, that should satisfy all but the ABSOLUTE pickiest of listeners!

1250718,4,B000028U3R,"Totally love the movie. Nothing to add there.
This is a really nice signature edition, however the quality of the products is a bit of a let-down.

1) The box itself is a bit flimsy. I expected a sturdier box.
2) The art book pages were stuck together and caused some tearing when being pulled apart. Luckily, it only happened on one page, but quite a few pages were stuck together. I do not anticipate it to last very long. I would have to open the book often to ensure that pages to not stick together.
3) The figurine is small and very plastic, but I can live with that.
4) The production of the disks seems poor, but I suppose as long as it plays properly then there is no problem.

I'm probably just being OCD today.

Basically I paid about $55 including shipping & duties to South Africa, which is borderline okay. However, I would not recommend paying more than that. You can rather buy a separate figure and art book and get better quality.",1497916800,2,948,4.344632768361582

1250722,4,B000028U3R,"Review of The Iron Giant
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

A little boy makes friends with a robot, insisting hes gentle even when the government suggests hes armed and dangerous. Although it doesnt sound like a normal premise for a childrens cartoon, The Iron Giant is actually really delightful for kids and parents alike.

Cartoons nowadays are sometimes just flashy and noisy, and absolutely torturous for parents to watch. And youll be hard pressed to find one that actually teaches kids good lessons! The Iron Giant teaches good things. I won't spoil any plot points, but trust me, the lessons are ones youll want your kids to learn. The last portion of the movie does have some violence, but compared to the loud, flashy scenes of todays movies, its nothing your kids haven't seen before. And the animation is regular 2-D style, which I believe is better for kids brains and developing attention spans anyway. When I watch a cartoon, I like it to look drawn by a person, not by a computer.

If you particularly want your children to be shielded from onscreen violence, you can wait until your kids are a little older. Otherwise, its a really great movie to watch with your sons and daughters!",1497225600,,1196,4.712918660287081

Definitely a keeper for those who love classic animation with real-world story. I recommend if you want to know more about the director, you should watch the documentary about the making of this film, titled 'The Making of The Iron Giant'. It kinda brought me to tears, because the person who directed this movie, had a family member who lost their lives to gun violence. Although I'm pro-2nd amendment, I still love the message of this movie for making a choice not to pull the trigger, and of course, having a childhood friend who was there for Hogarth, made me feel as a child that its always good to have a friend, for me, it was God. Not saying the Giant is God, but for me, it was a reflection of my own life in some ways. Its hard for me to explain, but, hey, if you've never seen this movie, GO WATCH IT!!

1250743,1,B000028U3R,"This movie, released July 31, 1999, is a landmark sign of the decline of Western Civilization.  It is the kids movie that will proudly teach your little kids how to cuss .  It will also present them with a sophomoric political message about guns and also will prepare them for how to die in a nuclear attack.  Fittingly, the movie includes the 1950's ""Duck and Cover"" safety film, followed by atomic bombs falling from the sky and cartoon versions of nuclear holocaust and robot invasion.  This and other special moments of the film will cause you to teach your children new curse words as well as you try to explain what mommy just said in response to various scenes.  After the movie, my 7 year old told me that he wants to invent a new bullet, a kind that will explode with poison just in case the bullet itself didn't do the trick.  I had to inform him that it already exists and he ought to create a weapon that protects against such bullets instead.

I love the movie's animation, characters, voices, and the story. It's a spectacular 2D film, like many others. I also love the message it sends on anti-war and guns.

I never understood why this film didn't got the hype it deserve back in 1999. But now hearing that film had a re-release in select theaters and was re-branded on DVD and Blu-Ray, I'm happy it's getting the attention even after it was underrated. It's good to see a cult/fanbase in love with this film in the 21st century, then in 1999. I will promote this film around with people, friends, and family.

As for the product of the Signature Edition, I love it. First of all, I love the new cover for the movie; it looks like it took some inspiration from many posters from history. I love the brighter colors, the larger screen size, and higher quality in the newer version of the filmm. And I did enjoy the deleted scene with the robots origins. This film was also the first time I saw the Rotten Tomato's Certified Fresh sticker, which was unique; I even kept the sticker on the box.

First movie I ever made out with someone during the credits - and we were intently watching the whole movie too*. Brilliant storytelling, fantastic animation, and a surprisingly moving story that almost always makes me cry. If you love sci-fi and want to get in touch with your emotions, this is a great way to do so. Or you can just enjoy the brilliance of Brad Bird before the Incredibles and Mission Impossible.

*Side note: Best way to pull the moves on a movie buff? Pay attention to the movie, and if it's one they've seen before, comment on what you liked/disliked as soon as the credits start rolling, and then boom! Face-time. However, don't try to pull this unless they've either seen the movie before, or they didn't like the movie - if your movie buff is viewing a movie for the first time and enjoyed it, they'll want to watch the credits (in fact, they may want to look at the credits if they hate the movie as well - depends on the movie buff).

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Adapted from the late British poet laureate Ted Hughes' much-loved children's story The Iron Man, the animated feature THE IRON GIANT [1999] concerns the adventures of a boy Hogarth Hughes [voiced by Eli Marienthal] who, at the height of 1950s Cold War paranoia, befriends a giant friendly robot The Iron Giant [voiced by Vin Diesel] with mysterious origins and an insatiable appetite for metal. Trusting only a friendly beatnik junkman/artist Dean McCoppin [voiced by Harry Connick Jr.] with his secret, the young boy is forced to hide his new friend from a government investigator Kent Mansley [voiced by Christopher McDonald] who is sure that the Iron Giant robot is intent on total annihilation destruction, or at least sure enough to justify his own sadistic impulses to destroy The Iron Giant forever.

THE IRON GIANT is a Brad Birds non-digital hand drawn animation of the 1968 childrens story that has an irresistible simplicity and charm, and with this Blu-ray Signature Edition, and is a beautiful homage and adaption, based on the 1968 warm lovely book ""The Iron Man"" by novelist Ted Hughes and where Brad Bird transplanted the story from England to 1950s small-town Maine of the U.S.A. State of America. Hogarth Hughes, the adventurous child of a hard-working single mother and Dad's absence is never explained, saves the Iron Giant when it becomes entangled in high-tension wires while dining on an electrical tower, and the big Iron Giant becomes his secret playmate. But the townspeople are already in a dither about odd goings-on in the environs, especially cars and tractors with huge chunks bitten out of them and it is not long before a Government agent arrives to find out what is going on.

With the fantasy animation THE IRON GIANT, a metal-eating iron giant from outer-space crash-lands in rural Maine in 1957 and the year of the Sputnik launch, finds the Iron Giant biting lumps out of automobiles and power stations; he looks like every red-scare Twilight Zone fantasy come true. But the Iron Giant is scared and lonely and a little kid called Hogarth Hughes becomes his only friend. THE IRON GIANT predates Brad Birds 2003 computer animation gem The Incredibles and its non-digital animated style has simplicity and charm; in 2016, and it looks closer to the Japanese animation tradition and is a really lovely film to revisit. This new Signature Edition includes a new scene that does not add or subtract from the overall animation film, which continues to be very funny, heart-warming, and powerful as when it was first released well over fifteen years ago.

When Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies adapted the story for the screen, with the executive producer input of The Whos Pete Townshend and they took this rather psychedelic enemy and turned it into something much more appropriate for the films 1957 setting: the Red Menace Cold War paranoia is everywhere in Rockwell, Hogarth Hughes hometown, switched across the Atlantic from Ted Hughes native of the United Kingdom. An early glimpse of The Iron Giant prompts one of Hogarth Hughess classmates to whisper the telling words: Its probably been sent by foreign enemies to take over the country, we should bomb it to smithereens before it does. Like so many other superhero comics and films, the consensus from mankind is that what is different should be feared.

While most people are terrified of the inquisitive metal-munching giant, Hogarth Hughes is one of the few whose curiosity outweighs his trepidation and he ventures out at night from under the watchful eye of his overworked single mother, the clearest similarity yet to E.T. and the Amblin spirit, and rescues the wandering giant, keeping it hidden in his barn. As the pair talk, the Iron Giant echoes from inside the water tower and hit upon the defining message of the film and all superhero stories: does your nature define you?

Hogarth Hughes shows his comic book collection to the Iron Giant, pointing out Atomo, a nasty metal menace bearing an unmistakeable resemblance to him. The Iron Giants anxious eyes say it all: am I evil as well because I look like him? Instead, Hogarth Hughes compares him to Superman, with his similar origin story: Sure, hes famous now, but he started off just like you. Crash-landed on Earth, the Giant didn't know what he was doing. But of course he only uses his powers for good not evil.

The Iron Giant doesnt even demonstrate any superpowers until late in the film, when his true nature reveals itself. He has a self-defence mechanism where the sight of even a toy gun makes him retaliate with lethal force. It is all part of his programming, but it nearly kills Hogarth Hughes when the two are playing in a scrapyard. The more generous part of his nature leads the giant to save two children falling to their death, but in doing so he reveals himself to the townspeople and attracts the attention of the US army.

They launch an assault on the Giant, but only succeed in pushing back any sentience he had and turning him into a rampaging killing machine, and replete with lasers and machine guns wiping out anything that threatens to attack. Hes only defending himself, but his true nature is destroying the town, and eventually it leads a reckless officer to launch a nuclear attack. Buildings crumble and cities are levelled as a matter of course in most superhero films, but their destruction rarely feels meaningful or scary.

Brad Bird makes the impending annihilation of one small town feel more important than any number of end-of-the-world threats. As the missile drifts into the atmosphere, the Iron Giant proves hes a true superhero, abilities or not. The Iron Giant flies to meet the missile head-on, remembering Hogarth Hughess words: You are who you choose to be, and uttering his response Superman right before the moment of impact.

THE IRON GIANT is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Its historical background is unlikely to resonate with youngsters, but boys in particular seem likely to respond to its story of a hulking robot willing to take instruction from a child. Many adults, including parents eager to have their children absorb lessons about the perils of guns and the merits of peace and tolerance will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history.

In the animated film THE IRON GIANT doesnt roam Maine countryside in brightly-coloured spandex or thwart an evil villains plot to destroy the world. Unlike the protagonists of MARVELs high-octane blockbusters he barely utters a word, but at heart he represents one of the most authentic portrayals of heroism ever seen. The Iron Giant is a reminder that whether you are born with superpowers or not, your original identity doesnt define you. You are what you choose to be.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Movies brings you this wonderful THE IRON GIANT fantasy fable on this Blu-ray disc with a resplendent and awesome 1080p encoded image, with an equally impressive framed in the film's original 2.40:1 [CinemaScope] aspect ratio. The CGI animation dazzles in 1080p, especially the way the hand-drawn animation, and in some cases and depending on the print you saw back in the day of its inferior DVD release, the image quality is much brighter, cleaner, and more vibrant than the initial theatrical cinema release. THE IRON GIANT does everything well for the black levels. Colours pop out of the screen, creating a vivid sense of this wonderful animated world and the image is strikingly clear, a big step up over the inferior DVD. This THE IRON GIANT: SIGNATURE EDITION Blu-ray disc is absolutely gorgeous and everyone involved should be proud of all the effort in producing this animated fantasy classic.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Movies brings you this wonderful THE IRON GIANT fantasy fable on this Blu-ray disc with a stunning 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack that features excellent dynamic range, engaging surround panning, and thundering explosion coming out of all your speakers. The voices of the cast are crisp and clear, while the Giant's voice evokes a grander scale. Dynamic range is excellent, whether the mix is recreating quiet forest locations or raging storms or the weapons-heavy climax. The surround sounds is deep and forceful; every time the Giant takes his steps, the room thunders. Lastly, I was also impressed with the way the sound designers panned various effects. Sometimes this was done to evoke off-screen character placement, and other times the mix was action-picture aggressive. The only slightly down side of the sound experience, is that I have heard other audio tracks that are a slightly more aggressive, and a little bit more delicate in the sound design itself. But, given the film's 1999 origins, surround sound fans are going to love this one. So top marks all round.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Signature Edition Film and Original Edition Film.

Audio Commentary with Director Brad Bird, Story Department Head Jeffrey Lynch, Animation Supervisor (Iron Giant) Steven Markowski and Head of Animation Tony Fucile: Here I am concentrating on the Signature Edition audio commentary, where we have Brad Birds new audio commentary where the new extended scenes have been added to the film. So at the start of the film, Brad Bird explains that they designed the new Warner Bros. logo, which we view at the start of the film and just at this point Brad Bird introduces himself, then Jeffrey Lynch introduces himself, then next is Steven Markowski and then finally we have Tony Fucile introduce himself. One unfortunate aspect of this audio commentary is that it is stated that they are viewing the DVD, well to me that is not on and is a very unprofessional attitude and should have been re-recorded to mention that they are viewing the Blu-ray disc. When you see the young Hogarth Hughes goes exploring in the woods, when this part of the film was shown only in rough hand drawn Black-and-White animation to the Executives, they were not very impressed, but eventually they finally got to see it is full Technicolor and they were very impressed. When you see Annie Hughes pouring out the coffee to Dean McCoppin in the Dinner, this is the first extra scene added, and Brad Bird informs us they could not at the time added this scene in because of budget restrictions, but Brad Bird feels this was a very nice introduction to two people who were obviously very attracted to each other, and was so pleased that this has now been added to this Signature Edition film. When you see the two old train drivers being asked questions about the train crash, we are told that they are voiced by Frank Thomas [Animator] and Ollie Johnston [Animator] were gracious to be allowed to be part of the voice cast of the train drivers, and of course were part of the legendary Walt Disney animator artists, and Brad Bird and others thought it was a great tribute to them. When you see the Iron Giant fire his laser beam at Hogarth, thinking he was being attacked with Hogarths toy ray gun, because you suddenly realise he is a defensive robot, and Dean rejects him out of the junk yard, not realising what is wrong and walks out into the snow covered landscape sad and lonely, well brad Bird wanted this to be like the Frankenstein scenario of being rejected by society, but of course eventually it all works out right in the end, when The Iron Giant becomes the hero. As we get to near the end of the film, Brad Bird has his final comments, when he says, I always wanted life to go on, especially with THE IRON GIANT film, also I want to mention Andrew Jimenez [Animatics], who did an amazing work on the animatics and was involved with a lot of the shots, but it was a totally difficult experience and well as a totally pleasurable experience and I think everyone involved else with the animated film. So ends a really enjoyable audio commentary, where everyone gave their contributions very well, but sometimes they would go off on a tangent and talk about a lot of internal politics and technical jargon of aspects of making the film., that sometimes got slightly boring, but despite that, it was still and enjoyable audio commentary, that really highlighted the technical challenges that went into making THE IRON GIANT a really beautiful stunning animated film, that was a joy to behold and watch and especially knowing it was all hand drawn and filmed in Technicolor. So once again this particular audio commentary for the Special Edition is the one to listen to.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes with Introduction by Brad Bird [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [15:16] Here you have a selection of Six animated storyboards depict earlier versions of the film that were deleted, which are as follows: Original Opening Sequence; Campfire; The Drag Race; Tired at Breakfast; Original Introduction to Hogarth & Annie and Classroom. As usual you can either watch them separately or Play All. What you get to view is Black-and-White storyboard images, with some basic animation, plus some actual colour animation.

Special Feature: Teddy Newton: The X Factor [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:38] Here we get a short look at the guy from the film's storyboard department, who had a very vivid and wild imagination. Nicknamed, ""the X Factor"" due to his wild, uninhibited imagination. We also get an interesting short interview with the storyboard artist of the same name and it features a truly weird storyboard animation sequence that never made it to the film and that is why Brad Bird pulled him from the team involved with the Storyboard Department, despite everyone said he was a very talented over the top person. Contributors include Jeffrey Lynch [Story Department Head] and Brad Bird [Director].

Special Feature: Duck and Cover Sequence [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:23] Once again we meet Teddy Newton [""the X Factor""] of the Storyboard Department at the time and describes the outline of what the Duck and Cover Sequence is all about, which was originally going to be added to the animated film about the dropping of the Atom bomb and of course we get to view the actual animated Black-and-White storyboard with Teddy Newton doing the voice over, which you see him in a window at the top right of the screen and at the same time we get to hear the very silly children song and you can see why it was not allowed to be inserted into the animated film, as it is totally dreadful.

Special Feature: The Voices of THE IRON GIANT [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:16] Here we have a selection of Five different items, looking in-depth at the actors behind these animated characters and they are as follows: The Voice of the Giant; Hogarth Hughes; Dean McCoppin; Annie Hughes and Kent Mansley. As usual you can view each item separately or Play All. We also get contributions from the following people: Vin Diesel [Voice of the Giant], Brad Bird [Director], Tony Facile [Animation Department head], Allison Abbate [Producer] and Jim Van der Keyl [Animator].

Special Feature: The Score [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:49] Here we take a look at the film music score in three scenes with Michael Kamen [Composer] (1948  2003) explaining the reason for the music score with each particular scene you view, which are as follows:  The Score: Opening Sequence; The Score: The Deer and The Score: Kent and Hogarth. As usual you can view each item separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Behind the Armor [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [17:31] Here we have a collection of Six short features produced for the Special Edition DVD and they are as follows: The Warner Bros. Logo; The Origin of the Giant; The Origin of the Movie; Bringing the Giant to Life; Storyboard and Animatics, and The Battle Sequence. As usual you can view each item separately or Play All. We also get contributions from the following people: Andrew Jimenez [Animatics], Brad Bird [Director], Joe Johnson [Iron Giant Designer], Mark Whiting [Production Designer], Des McAnuff [Producer], Tim McCanlies [Screenwriter], Allison Abbate [Producer], Jeffrey Lynch [Story Department Head], Kevin OBrien [Storyboard Artist], Mark Andrews [Storyboard Artist] and Dean Wilkins [Animator].

Special Feature: Motion Gallery [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:22] Here you get to view is a Black-and-White Animated Storyboard of the basic outline of the storyline for the animated film, plus you also get to view inserted scenes from the film in colour, as well as some really stunning beautiful artist drawings, and while viewing all this you get to hear the brilliant and dramatic composed music film score by Michael Kamen (1948  2003).

Special Feature: Brad Bird Trailer [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:29] Here we get to view the Brad Birds brilliant concept Theatrical Trailer for the film THE IRON GIANT, plus we get to hear once again the very dramatic and brilliant composed film music score by Michael Kamen. The only disappointment is that we only get to view it in the 480i video resolution and the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and what a shame they could not have remastered this to be viewed in the stunning 1080p video resolution and especially in the 2.40:1 [CinemaScope] aspect ratio. As to the mysterious voice over, I reckon it is Brad Bird himself.

Signature Edition Trailer [2015] [1080p] [1:78:1] [2:32] Here we get to view another brilliant trailer, but this time it is to celebrate the 16th Anniversary THE IRON GIANT: Signature Edition film release, and its lasting appeal for all generations. The only slightly confusing aspect of this particular trailer is why was it shown in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio, instead of the actual 2.40:1 [CinemaScope] aspect ratio? Despite this, it is a totally brilliant dramatic awesome presentation of this newly remastered classic hand drawn animated film.

Special Feature: The Making of 'THE IRON GIANT' [2000] [480i] [1.33:1] [22:05] This is a special Warner Bros. original documentary on the making of the animated family film 'THE IRON GIANT.' This documentary treats movie fans to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of 'THE IRON GIANT,' about a boy who befriends an enormous robot from outer space, only to discover his reasons for coming to Earth may not have been friendly. It includes interviews with the voice cast and crew, who share some of their experiences they had in making the animated film and discuss some of the special efforts that went into making the animated film. Contributors include Brad Bird [Director], Jennifer Aniston [Annie Hughes], Eli Marienthal [Hogarth Hughes], Vin Diesel [The Iron Man], Harry Connick Jr. [Dean McCoppin], Christopher McDonald [Kent Mansley], John Mahoney [General Royard], Jennifer Cardon Klein [Animator], Ricardo Curtis [Animator], Scott F. Johnston [Artistic Coordinator], Allison Abbate [Producer], Dennis Venizelos [Head of Background], Alan Bodner [Art Director], Dean Wellins [Supervising Animator] and Beau Weaver (Narrator). Directed by Kevin Gill. Produced by Aleshka Ferrero, Andrew Bernard, Julie Cohen, Kevin Gill, Nicole Wrathall-Higgins and Suzanne McCafferty. Screenplay by Kevin Gill. Cinematography by Ed Riley and Terri MacKay.

Special Feature: Vintage Easter Eggs [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:48] With this special feature we get to view a selection of different items. First up is a very personal typed letter from author Ted Hughes that was sent on the 8th January, 1998 to Allison Abbate [Producer]. We also get to view some early short conceptual computer animation clips that are in colour, plus some Black-and-White storyboard animations; especially The Iron Giant doing a ballet routine, animated layout sketches of Kent Mansleys pipe exploding and Hogarth Hughes break-dancing.

Special Feature: The Salt Mines [2015] [1080p] [1.33:1/1.78:1] [7:06] Here we get to view a short but fascinating featurette about the film's original elements for 'THE IRON GIANT,' that were stored 650 feet (200 m) below in the Strataca Salt Mine Museum in Hutchinson, Kansas, United States, along with many other Warner Bros. archival materials for their storage service. In 1999, the Original Artwork for 'THE IRON GIANT,' was boxed up and sent away to the storage facility, and no one had seen it since. Now, Brad Bird asked Crew Member Andrew Jimenez to find the material . . . Before the films Signature Edition film release, and Andrew Jimenez informs Brad Bird on the telephone that the items he seeks has been found in the designated safe haven in Kansas, where you see Andrew Jimenez with the help of Jeff Ollenburger who is the Business Development and Sales Manager for Underground Vaults and Storage facility retrieve the rare Original Artwork for 'THE IRON GIANT.' We also find out how Warner Bros. stores nearly Three Million Pieces of their Film History in this special vault facility. Since 1923, the Strataca Salt Mine Museum (formerly Carey Salt) has produced rock salt and right throughout the Second World War and several different Companies have been storing items for security reasons, because of its safety record. In one section alone there are 80,000 boxes stored. As we get near to the end of this special feature, we hear the voice of Brad Bird say, The artwork from the film, should be preserved, because it is part of the lineage of the film. The original drawings look different than what you see on the screen, and the animator is trying to achieve. You see how an artist is finding inspiration for the film, and the exploration that you do in making of the film is valuable. Its valuable for people to go back and see the roads not taken, as well as the road taken. One of the beautiful things about archives is that you retrace the steps and understand how things were arrived at and a lot of trial and error. All of that reportorial artwork is part of people who made the film. When you see some of the boxes are opened, we get to see some stunning beautiful artwork that was a joy to view.

Special Feature: Hand Drawn [2015] [480i/1080p] [1.33:1/1.78:1] [1:40] Director Brad Bird talks about his love for hand drawn animation and at the start of this special we see a selection of roughly hand drawn Black-and-White animated drawing of the main characters in the film and we hear Brad Bird comment in saying that he loves hand drawn animation, and its imperfections are more perfect, because it shows a lot of emotions. We see some old footage animators working on the THE IRON MAN film, as well as looking at the storyboard images. Brad Bird also comments by saying that it would be a great loss if they stopped making films by the hand drawing technique process, and I totally agree with that statement, as you only have to look at any of the original cartoons produced by the Walt Disney Studios. This special short is a really heart-warming wonderful dedication to all hand drawn animation artists.

Special Feature: The Giant's Dream: The Making of THE IRON GIANT [2015] [480i/1080p] [1.33:1/1.78:1] [55:44] The Giant's Dream is how a team of unknown artists and first-time director, made one of animations greatest film THE IRON GIANT. When the animated film THE IRON GIANT opened in the late summer of 1999, one of the biggest summers in Hollywood history up to that point, it landed with a thud at the box office, even though it was beloved by critics everywhere. The film THE IRON GIANT is about the friendship between a boy and an alien robot in the heat of late 1950s paranoia, eventually went on to greater success on home video, and is now considered an animated cult classic. The Giants Dream isn't just the story of the making of THE IRON GIANT, but it is also the story of the mad rush to produce animated films from just about every studio in Hollywood in the 1990s. Mostly, this very special documentary is really the story of a creative genius of Brad Bird, who was ahead of his time in many ways, and kept pushing the system to treat animated film as more than a just cheap product for little children who would go see anything, instead Brad Bird treated animation like it was art.

This documentary starts with a piece of old animation made by Bird himself as a youngster, where a voiceover from the man himself tells us that ever since he was a small child, he had dreams of being an animator and he never gave up on those dreams. This documentary is peppered throughout with illustrations from Brad Bird telling his life story. Interestingly, even though the story goes through many decades. At the age of 14, after finishing his rough animation of The Tortoise and The Hare, Brad sends of the film to the Walt Disney Studio and the folks at Walt Disney Animation were so enthralled with this brilliant young protg child artist that they gave him a scholarship to CalArts [California Institute of the Arts], where he studied, among the first graduating class, alongside future Pixar/Disney creative officer John Lasseter and director Tim Burton. From CalArts, Brad Bird was offered a job at Walt Disney Animation straight away.

But this was in the early 1980s, a rough time for animation in general. Everything was being done on the cheap, and the Walt Disney Studio wasn't the powerhouse they had been or would become again. Brad Bird kept challenging the staff at Disney on the way things were being done, and it totally rubbed them all the wrong way. His time there was short-lived, and he felt his dreams soon crumble after he was fired. Soon after, his sister was killed in an act of gun violence; the documentary shows how this was all a long, dark time for Brad Bird.

The documentary contains a great soundbite from director Guillermo del Toro, who personally called Brad Bird to congratulate him on the film soon after it opened in cinemas and he reminded Brad that quality always wins out in the end. At the very end of this behind-the-scene of the Making of THE IRON GIANT we are informed the dream is still ongoing and at the time they filmed the documentary, all the original crew were reunited to add two new scenes to THE IRON MAN Signature Edition film, and as they say at the very end of all Warner Bros. Cartoons Thats All Folks!

Finally, when THE IRON GIANT animated film arrived in cinemas in 1999, it was hailed as an instant classic by Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal. THE IRON GIANT on Blu-ray was well worth the wait. On top of that, there's a stunning new documentary to watch as well as what appears to be all the bonus materials from the 1999 and 2004 inferior DVD releases. Highly Recommended!

1250874,5,B000028U3R,"Finally this film gets the release treatment its been due all along! I have bought several collectors edition box sets for my favorite films and many of them, I'd say the high majority, are disappointing. Usually they are made of cheap flimsy materials with not very good art direction. This is not the case here!

The Iron Giant Signature box set is everything it claims to be and more. The box itself is gorgeous, the image on the front has a shiny reflective glare to it that is just beautiful. The hardcover book inside is designed beautifully and the poster prints are printed on a nice heavy stock and packed away in a sturdy envelope to keep them from getting dinged up. Those impressed me the most as I expected them to be printed on flimsy poster paper. I was wrong they look awesome and are ready to be framed! The Iron Giant statue inside is small and what you'd expect, not really anything I'm interested in but it's there and looks fine.

My only minor complaint would be the Blu Ray packaging itself. It's just a standard plastic Blu Ray case. Missed opportunity here to put a steelbook Blu Ray case in there with an artsy cover. It would have really made this set perfect. If they ever release a steelbook edition of this film I may just get it and replace the plastic case. I checked and a steelbook will fit in the space provided, but it will be a bit snug. That's a minor complaint though and something very specific that I would want. Probably won't be an issue for others.

For the reasonable price of this set you definitely get what you pay for and more. Really a definitive set for one of the greatest animated films of all time that transcends age and time. Beautiful animation, touching story and now...finally...a beautiful shell to house this classic. Must buy for fans of the film or animation fanatics.",1479945600,,1831,4.525679758308157

The rental was only a 24 hour digital rental, so when he asked for it the next day, he was really sad that we didn't have it anymore. I promised him we would get it for him. I was luckily able to find that they were getting ready to release this Signature Edition on blu-ray and it was available for pre-order. I set it up and anxiously waited for it to be released.

Incredible stuff. You owe it to yourself to own this masterpiece of animation. A film that never loses it power to enchant & captivate, no matter how many times you've seen it. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A gigantic alien robot crash lands on Earth, all memory of who & what he is scrambled. The robot is discovered by a young boy, Hogarth Hughes, and the two become fast friends. Together, they embark on a journey of discovery, learning not only about each other but themselves as well. Complications ensue when Hogarth & the Giant are beset upon by a relentless, utterly paranoid government agent. As the threat of conflict becomes inevitable the Giant opts to flee rather than harm anyone, until a misunderstanding brings him into a direct, devastating confrontation with the Army. Just when common sense seems poised to win the day, fear & ignorance rear their ugly heads once again, forcing The Giant to make one final choice... one which will change his life, and the lives of everyone around him, forever.

THOUGHTS: I recall seeing the poster for this in a theater, but never got around to catching it first-run. Discovering it a year or two afterwards on home video, I was instantly captivated. IRON GIANT is quite simply one of the most wonderful, most beautiful films I've ever seen. Don't let the fact that it's a ""cartoon"" turn you away. It is a spell-binding piece of movie-making that will touch you. And forget the 1 STAR haters who denounce it due to the perceived ""anti-gun"" message of the film. That's bunk. Director Brad Bird lost his sister to gun violence and he simply turned that very personal tragedy into a moving & haunting screenplay; wondering what might happen if a gun had the ability to choose for itself whether or not to kill. When you know about this terrible piece of backstory, the film's subtext makes perfect sense. All things considered, I cannot fault Brad Bird for his feelings. This is, after all, his film. I certainly empathize with his loss and his point of view. (I wonder if these same 1 STAR reviewers cry 'Foul!' about any supposed ""messages"" found within THE YEARLING, or OLD YELLER or BAMBI?? Hmmm...)

THE BLU-RAY: Warner gives us a very nice restoration & remastering of this terrific film in the high definition format. You can watch it in its original theatrical cut or check out the new ""expanded"" version of the film, which restores a few key scenes, most notably the Iron Giant's junkyard nightmare & his brief conversation with Hogarth about the soul. These new bits are interesting and worth watching, but THE IRON GIANT as originally released is still perfect. You cannot go wrong watching either cut. The film has been nicely cleaned up for this hi-def release, looking better than ever. A much improved picture over the standard-def DVD, with a clean clear sound upgrade to compliment the video tweaks. A wealth of excellent bonus goodies simply seals the deal, making this Signature Edition Blu-ray of THE IRON GIANT a must-own. 5 STARS",1478476800,5,3180,4.799270072992701

1250916,5,B000028U3R,"One of the best animated movies ever.  This little gem by director Brad Bird, was the critics darling (and mine, too) when it first came out.  Unfortunately, it was not seen by a lot of people.  Over the years it has built up quite a following.

This new version has some extra animated scenes that have been inserted since the original release.  The new scenes add about 2 minutes to the movie.  It makes a already animated classic even better.

Also included is a documentary on the making for the Iron Giant.  This documentary was first shown at the San Diego Comic-Con (where I saw it).  It is a welcome edition to the loads of extras available on this signature addition.

This is a highly recommended movie for young and old.

I recommend you purchase this BLU-Ray set.  For more on the Iron Giant, read about it on Wikipedia:

1251000,2,B000028U3R,"The animation is great. However, the plot is intolerably stupid.

SPOILER ALERT!
The giant robot is damaged when he crash lands on Earth which renders him a funny, relatively harmless sidekick for a little boy. Meanwhile, the government is trying to hunt him down and destroy him because they believe he is an indestructible, giant death robot from space who can single handedly kill all humans on the planet. BAD government! The trouble is, he actually *IS* an indestructible, giant death robot from space who can single handedly kill all humans on the planet. He was purpose built as a killing machine and he just happens to be temporarily docile due to his bump on the head. Worse, he is potentially the advance guard for an army of such robots (shown in flashbacks wreaking havoc across the galaxy.) The ""happy ending"" when he reassembles himself after surviving a nuclear explosion was actually pretty spooky. We're supposed to feel comfortable with a giant killer death robot on the loose who was part of an army of such robots who have been busily destroying planets. Why?--because a little boy has taught him that he can overcome his genocidal programming by just wanting to be nice. Never mind that pointing a water pistol at him is enough to get him to revert to his murderous ways. Meanwhile, the really scary people according to the writers of this hot mess are the government and military who try to protect the human race from extermination as well as a couple of hunters who shot a deer with their ""bad gun!"" This kind of illogical, nonsense is typical of Hollywood these days. I can imagine what a wonderful children's movie this could have been if Walt Disney had made it instead of some cognitively impaired, propaganda artists.",1473465600,3,1746,4.8006644518272426

It looks fantastic, has some solid extras, and the price ($10) was appreciated. I strongly recommend this blu-ray / movie. Now for some extra info about the special features:

<< Extra scenes >>
So short, the ""Signature Edition Version"" and ""Theatrical Version"" are both listed as 90 minutes long on the case. Don't expect a lot. That said, the first fits well into the narrative, and I like the addition. The second is impactful, and/but changed the tone of the movie. It was interesting to see, gives credibility to Kent Mansley's fears, but wasn't so smooth a fit (in my opinion).

The animation is NEW. Will you notice the difference? Yes, but it's close to the original. I think it is very cool that part of the team reunited to create and include them.

<< ""The Voices of The Iron Giant"" >>
I was disappointed with this. There is little to no footage of...or an interview with...""The Voices"". (Jennifer Anniston, Henry Connick Jr., etc.). You know, the people you expect to hear from. This extra is mostly about listening to Brad, Allison, and James discuss character design.",1473465600,,1102,4.7591623036649215

The fact that this is a movie made for children and it's message was clear to me even when I saw it as a small child is just amazing.

It's not just a cute movie about princes & princesses falling in love and singing. From themes of death to spirituality, it is in your face like ""Hey, death happens but it's okay because we have souls and souls live forever."" Aside from my love of the movie, this signature edition box is great. I love the book that comes with it. The art inside of it is gorgeous. My only complaint is that a couple of the pages were stuck together so they got messed up a little bit when I separated them. The art that comes with it is stunning. Those will all definitely be hung up some time in the hopefully near future. The figurine that comes with it is adorable. I already found a place to display it. I haven't had a chance to see the movie yet but I'm sure the picture will be more crisp though since it's a Blu-Ray, so I'm not concerned about that. All in all, it was definitely worth every penny. I almost cried like 10 times while un-boxing it. Also, if it matters, I have The Giant tattooed on my body with my favorite quote from this movie "" You are who you choose to be.""

Excellent new documentary, ""The Giant's Dream"", goes into a lot of backstory on the animation industry at the time and the difficulty in getting this made.

Now that I'm an adult pursuing a career in animation, there are a lot of stuff to appreciate about this film. I won't spoil the movie

But I will say this, The Iron Giant does an amazing job creating a world that truly engulfs the audience till the credits roll.

1251025,5,B000028U3R,"The Iron Giant: Signature Edition,"" originally released in 1999, is set in the 1950s and is the animated tale of an unlikely friendship between a 9-year-old rebellious boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) and a giant robot, voiced by Vin Diesel. The voice cast also includes Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick, Jr. Hogarth lives in a world in which fears of nuclear war and Russian espionage are widespread. The boy finds and befriends a 50-foot robot that feeds on metal  an armed probe sent by an unknown race of extraterrestrials. With the assistance of his artist pal Dean, Hogarth tries to hide his giant playmate, particularly from the suspicious eyes of a Communist-obsessed federal agent.

The film will remind viewers of Spielbergs E.T. Both movies feature visitors from outer space, a young boy as protagonist, and an unorthodox relationship. But The Iron Giant, based on a childrens book by Ted Hughes, is more than a mere wannabe copy. It is an allegory about the conflict of innocence and Cold War paranoia, and brings to mind a film made during the era depicted  The Day the Earth Stood Still, which had its own giant robot from beyond the stars. The best scenes involve the robot learning about earthy emotions, such as compassion, and especially his grasp of the term soul. Hogarth sees the robot not as a threat to mankind, but as an unusual, cool buddy.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray Signature Edition include the new documentary, The Giants Dream; a personal letter from director Brad Bird; theatrical version commentary by Brad Bird; additional scenes; alternate opening; mini-documentary segments; and Duck and Cover sequence.",1473120000,2,1656,5.032846715328467

The only reason I'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because this ""signature Edition"" had some quick, and clearly unnecessary scenes that weren't in the original, so they felt awkward. They were pretty pointless actually. I don't know what it is that makes distributors think extended versions are worth it. There was a reason these scenes were cut to begin with.

1251161,5,B000028U3R,This is one of my favorite animated theatrical releases because it would appeal to all children (and adults ) who love science fiction. But perhaps it is a well written story that touches on the concept of death and the belief in a soul that would help a child to understand the mortality of their own life in general.  Aside from no Blu-ray disc available they only added 3 minutes to the extended version which was nice but not enough substance to get excited about. Nonetheless it makes a good addition to the sci-fi library.,1458604800,,528,4.557894736842106

1251165,4,B000028U3R,"The Signature Edition looks much better than the Special Edition. The Signature Edition has more saturated color and much better black level and contrast. The Special Edition is much brighter overall. None of the many night scenes look like night in the Special Edition. They do in the Signature Edition.

The opening where Hogarth goes on the roof to check the antenna and then into the woods with the flashlight has much more suspense, as it appears to be night in the Signature Edition. The glowing power station and the Iron Giant getting shocked by the wires has much more pop in the Signature Edition. Hogarth coming up the stairs with the TV lighting the stairwell when he goes to check on the noise upstairs while watching TV is another good example. The Signature Edtiion lighting looks like a stairwell being lit only by the flickering TV screen.

The Signature Edition is dramaticallly better. It is like a different movie. And the sound is moderately better on SIgnature Edition.",1458259200,42,991,4.8579881656804735

1251199,5,B000028U3R,"One of the greatest animated films of all time. Brad Bird's masterpiece. It will probably never get the attention or respect it deserves, because WB has never properly handled the marketing of this outstanding movie. A boy and a giant robot from outer space, set during the Cold War... How is it that WB could have mishandled the marketing and promotion of this brilliant film so badly? Even the signature edition theatrical re-release was handled ham-fistedly. Two days? Really, WB? I was looking forward to seeing this in theaters since I missed it in 1999. Well, it was promoted so poorly last year that I missed it AGAIN! And I was so looking forward to taking my 5-year-old son to see it, to share this amazing film with him as it was meant to be experienced... On the big screen. Well, that was a bust. And now, I saw on Facebook that the newly remastered Signature Edition is being released in two days on... DVD. Yep, not Blu-Ray. DVD. And when I went to Amazon to pre-order it, it is only showing up as available for purchase as a download. What the heck? Who did Brad Bird tick off at WB that this film keeps getting mistreated so? I hope it gets a proper Blu-Ray release, with both the theatrical and Special Edition versions. And I hope it ends up back in theaters for an extended run. Please, if you haven't ever seen the Iron Giant, seek it out. It's one of the most masterfully made animated films of all time. It has more heart in a simple three word sentence than most movies could ever hope to contain. I love The Iron Giant. And I hope you will, too.",1455408000,3,1569,4.413793103448276
1251200,2,B000028U3R,"This seems like a professionally pirate copy of this movie. On a 1080P HD TV with an HD DVD/Blue Ray player this DVD looks grainy and terrible quality. The sound is even worse. Super disappointed. There also seems nothing ""Special"" at all about this special edition and it should be found odd that there are no trailers or ads of any kind preceding the film it goes straight to the main DVD menu like a true illegal pirate copy would.

1251209,4,B000028U3R,"A boy and his robot circa 1957 when we were still glowering at those darn commies.
Because his mother is always working and he is always left alone, nine-year old Hogarth Hughes likes to collect pets, like a trouser loving squirrel that his mother is loath to allow him to keep, to while away all those long-long hours each day when he is home alone.  One night, while Hogarth is home alone watching scary movies on TV, something big comes along and swipes the antenna from off their roof.  This he knows because Hogarth climbs up onto the roof of their two-story house to see whats happened to it.  Dressing like a commando, Hogarth sets off in pursuit and soon comes upon the metal eating giant robot.  Naturally, the military is soon involved along with a psychotic agent Kent Mansley who will stop at nothing to find the metal creature; this includes chloroforming Hogarth to get him out of the way.
Also prevalent in this movie is a very anti-gun message, hammered home multiple times (because once is never enough).

The Iron Giant was made on a budget of 70 million dollars, only to earn just 31.3 million on its initial release.  Brad Bird blamed its failure at the box office on Warner Bros., stating a lack of a marketing campaign all but killed its chances of being a hit.  Apparently, word of mouth had nothing to do with it.
Hogarth and the beatnik artist Dean are great characters and make a compelling team along with the Iron Giant and his rudimentary speaking skills.  The villain of the piece (Kent Mansley government agent), is baffling.  There are a few exceptional moments; the rest is predictable.",1454371200,2,1619,4.652631578947369

I already owned the movie but my son accidentally broke the disk trying to take it out of the box. I quickly ordered a replacement but did not receive the DVD I was expecting.  The box was previously opened, had a large yellow sticker on it and was shrink wrapped. The disk itself was not the same as my previous one either. My disk had the sky with the iron giant flying, my ""new"" purchase was a plain disk with ""The Iron Giant"" printed on it.

1251285,5,B000028U3R,"The classic animated film, that millions and millions people loved, from the genius mind of Brad Bird, comes the sixteen-year-old, ultra-famous, The Iron Giant.

The Iron Giant has a lot of action. However, this isn't just about explosions and fights. It is also a major drama with many twists and turns in the story that make it compelling and interesting. There is still a good amount of comedy to keep the viewer entertained. Actually, there is a fantastic amount of drama that keeps you at the edge of your seat and  still a good amount of comedy to make sure you enjoy it.

The story begins when a nine-year-old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) accidentally finds a 200 foot Iron Robot from outer space. They become close friends until the government realizes its existence and tries to destroy the robot. It is up to Hogarth and his family to protect the Iron Giant from destruction.

This film is truly wonderful. Brad Bird, the director, is famous for making some of the best animated films and I think this is one of his best work even through it is one of his first. Considering it was made in 1999, the animation is excellent and, some of the more tricky shots, such as the giant explosion, all done wonderfully well, just as if it was made more recently. The message of the story is truly sweet and is an important one  Don't judge a character by his appearance. The army looks at this giant iron creature from space and thinks it is there to kill them. Really, he has no idea why he is here. Its as if he is just a young boy.

My favorite scene is the opening shot. It starts by showing the first satellite in space in the 1950s. Then, a meteor flies by the satellite straight into the ocean. This meteor holds the one and only Iron Giant. I loved it because the animation is just amazing. You can even see some 3D animation, which was very new at the time.

Because there are some dramatic and intense scenes, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars since this film is a wonderful animated classic. The voice acting, the animation, the storyline and everything about this film is simply magical. I do hope there will be a sequel!

1251361,5,B000028U3R,"I recently rewatched THE IRON GIANT after having seen it twice the year it first came out. I didn't know the name Brad Bird when it was first released, but it clearly signaled the arrival of a major new talent. Based on a children's story by the poet Ted Hughes, the film relates the story of an alien robot that inadvertently arrives on planet earth during the height of the Cold War. Though a formidable weapon, the giant robot prefers spending its time play with the young boy who first discovers it. A government agent, however, has a different idea, and is intent on confiscating it for use by the military. This may seem like thin stuff upon which to hand a feature length animated film, but it is all done so cleverly that it feels like it is ending too soon. This was, by the way, one of the earliest things that most of us ever encountered Vin Diesel in. This is a great movie to show any child, and has a happy ending at the very end after a climax that seems to promise an unhappy one. THE IRON GIANT is one of those obscure gems that more kids . . . and adults . . . ought to know.",1434672000,2,1093,4.160377358490566

Nicely animated by Warner Brothers, and voiced by Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick jr, and Vin Diesel among others, the film is the story of a space-born giant iron robot.  The Iron Giant is based on a book by Ted Hughes.

This film is a good bet for children from about four and up.  There is some fantasy action, with laser blasts and explosions.  But there is also tenderness, especially illustrated by a scene with a deer in the forest.

Strongly recommended for a nice, 86 minute foray into the land of the Iron Giant.",1429574400,,611,4.663551401869159

1251419,5,B000028U3R,"One of the many struggles that filmmakers run into when making a children's film is creating something that appeals to both the children and their parents, who will most likely be watching it with them. THE IRON GIANT is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. While children (particularly boys) will appreciate the friendship of a boy with a giant robot, Brad Bird also manages to send up the Cold War era and provides a strong anti-gun message. For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",1427760000,4,1170,4.712195121951219

Another reviewer pointed out how bad the advertising was and it's a shame since this film made at the end of the 20th century showed there was hope for hand drawn animation combined with a computer animated robot!

This DVD is loaded with extras including one where if you click enter on the nuts and bolts symbol during watching the film you will see how this movie was made inbetween the various scenes of the film! One cameo has Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson, classic Disney animators, as train engineers that collide with the giant robot! As Frank Thomas said,""It was a giant metal man!"" If this film had been a success it would have brought in new hand drawn animation films instead of all CGI movies! It would not be only the far east that would make hand drawn animation!

Hogarth Hughs, Kent Mansley, Annie Hughs are all characters that are beautifully animated and don't talk down to the audience! While the Giant Robot is animated cleverly by the computer and is well combined with the hand drawn animation! This film stands out to this day as a shining example of great animation with a great story and it was 98 percent made in the United States! Look at the end credits with American names to see the huge list of american artists that worked on this movie! But because Warner Bros. pulled the movie just after one week of play out of prime time showings we are stuck with monotonous CGI showings while in Japan Miyazaki movies are hand drawn made and the hand drawn artform continues!

So get THE IRON GIANT to see great american hand drawn animation with a great story and a great computer animated robot! You will be glad you did!",1425686400,,1796,4.52

1251495,5,B000028U3R,"This movie is definitely one of my favorite films of all time (and I have seen a lot). It has always wrought emotions from me in ways that movies just never manage to do anymore, and it still does. The Iron Giant has all the adventure of The Incredibles (directed by the same guy, Brad Bird), and all the depth of emotion of something like E.T. The lessons it explores are something I'm glad I was taught at such a young age, and in such a fun, hilarious, heartfelt way. It really is a shame this story didn't receive more recognition and love than it did from audiences, because it certainly is worth it.

If you're a parent, or just a kid who grew up with the Iron Giant (like me), this movie has the sophistication to stay enjoyable and re-watchable many times over. I'm 21 now, and I still love to watch this flick, and I manage to enjoy it without feeling like a kid in a grown up body the way I do when I watch something fun, but more juvenile, like Tangled, or most other Disney flicks. I will always remember the Iron Giant, and I'm so glad I now get to share it with my nephew!",1419724800,,1086,4.171428571428572

The iron giant was written & animated really well, & directed by Brad Bird, the same director who also directed The Incredibles (one of my favorite animated films of all time!!). It has some very funny scenes. One of the funnier scenes was when the boy started saying grace at the dinner table & he noticed something wrong. I won't say more than that cause I wouldn't want to spoil any moments for anybody. The real reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I was a little disappointed with the backgrounds. I've seen so many beautifully detailed hand painted backgrounds from plenty of Disney movies that made this one feel a little plain. Other than that though, the film was a blast to watch with my wife & kids on one of our family movie nights. If you're looking for a good kids movie, look no further. You've found it here.

Now why would any company release a dvd which no computer running Windows could run? It boggles the imagination. So, I could not view the movie -- which is the sole purpose of buying a movie dvd.

1251655,5,B000028U3R,"In 1957, Sputnik was launched by Russia and a wave of quiet hysteria gripped the nation that eventually launched the Space Race and this is the climate of this particular movie. A meteor streaks to Earth from somewhere unknown and strange things soon start happening near the town of Rockwell as tales of outer space invaders begin to circulate. During an evening alone, a bright young boy, Hogarth Hughes decides to take in some guilty pleasures, such as snacks and a monster movie, when the TV goes out unexpectedly. When he climbs to the roof, he finds the antenna bitten off, and that's only the beginning. When he ventures alone into the woods, he discovers a huge metal creature attacking a power station seeking the metal for food. When it gets caught in the power lines, Hogarth at first flees out of terror, but regains his courage and returns to help by shutting down the power. It is then that his curiosity gets the better of him and at first, he seeks to get some pictures of the giant, only to find that the giant literally after him. After he stumbles and falls, he discovers the giant actually wants to be friendly and Hogarth eagerly obliges by teaching him about his surroundings-- and by hiding him from an overzealous government agent who wants to find and destroy him, deeming him a military threat, engaging in a battle of wits to do so. When Kent orders a nuclear missile strike on the giant that threatens the entire town, it is up to the giant to stop it, in order to save a friend.",1401148800,,1507,4.544117647058823

And with those overwhelming positive reviews for this movie, I was absolutely positive I was going to love it, but that only lead to disappointment.  This movie couldn't possibly be any more boring.  I had to start the movie 4 times before I could get past the first 30-45 minutes, and then I had to force myself to watch through to the end.  I didn't appreciate the annoyingly politically correct overtones in this film either; there were at least a dozen eye-rolling moments.
However, I won't bash it completely.  If I remember correctly, this movie was made during the dawn of computer animation but instead was one of the last films to completely stick with the old completely hand-drawn, cell-by-cell animation technique.  I do appreciate that, and it's done very well. That makes it a beautiful, very safe movie for the family, but also very dull.  I didn't like it at all.",1401062400,2,952,4.733333333333333

The animation, the voice work, and the story is outstanding.  Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol) directed it and adapted it from a book written several years before.

I showed this film in my high school US history class to demonstrate the fears that were prevalent in the Cold War. The kids loved it, because they saw that the cartoon they had seen as little kids actually had a whole other level of meaning. Many of these blase teens were actually quite moved. This film, adapted from a Ted Hughes children's book called the Iron Man, is actually a better story in the version offered here by the brilliant Brad Bird, who later directed The Incredibles. The moral lessons here are subtle yet powerful, as well, and this film could also be used with youth groups. It provoked some wonderful discussion.

It reminded of some of the best Japanese (non-CG) anime, and like Brad Bird's best CG animation (The Incredibles), there has been no sequel to this classic.  Of course it's EVERY boy's dream to have a giant robot as his friend!  Nevertheless, the film was able to convey this simple wish-fulfillment very nicely.  The boy-friendship story is broadened into a critique of how we view (and automatically fear) foreigners, strangers, anything that we don't know or understand.  (The Iron Giant, of course, is the ultimate alien.)  For adults, this larger message about how to transform fear into understanding fits very well within our present era and mindset of reflexive, overblown paranoia (insert ""terrorist"" or any other bete noir du jour), even if the filmmakers might not necessarily have that in mind.  In some ways, The Iron Giant also compares well with King Kong, with a different love story, course.",1392163200,,956,4.9748427672955975

1251752,5,B000028U3R,"My 6 year old son is into everything to do with robots.  I had no clue about this movie until I saw it listed as one of the 10 best robots in cinematic history.  I was surprised how wonderfully different this movie is from most children's movies out there.  In fact, it is the first time I saw my son have tears in his eyes at the end of a movie and that was not a bad thing because the tears are due to the amazing sacrifice of the robot.  It seems the movie will have a sad ending, but not quite.  I think many adults will enjoy it (as most action movies out there are much more childish than this film).  The story is one of humanity, the one of a robot who is set up to be a killing machine, but who does not want to kill.  It is a story of how things are not necessarily completely evil or good, that a person set up for evil can become good, and in the end self-sacrifice and heroism win.  This can be a great conversion starter about the important issue of true heroism, about willing to sacrifice even your life for your family and for others.  This is not like the dumb, horribly predictable endings of most children movies, including adult superhero movies like the Avengers. The ending of this movie has a lot of meaning and therefore is something many children will enjoy but will get a good message out of.  It is a surprisingly anti-war and anti-killing movie for a movie full of action and battle scenes worthy of any good superhero cartoon.  Rare to see a cartoon these days which kids can enjoy and also be taught about virtue at the same time.  My only negative comment is in regards to the use of some inappropriate words for a children's movie (""Oh, Great Mother of G..."") which were completely unnecessary, especially in a movie that teaches children some wonderful virtues to follow.

1251855,4,B000028U3R,"There's a scene approximately midway through The Iron Giant in which young Hogarth Hughes finds himself trying to explain death to his new friend, a giant metal robot from outer space.  ""Things die. That's part of life. It's bad to kill, but it's not bad to die,"" he tells the giant after they witness a deer shot by hunters.  That's a pretty heavy statement for what appears to be a kid friendly animated film, but The Iron Giant is anything but a mere children's film.  It's a surprisingly moving story about friendhsip and loyalty with additional subtext regarding such ""grown up"" issues as patriotism, intolerance, fear and our gun culture.  Yet at its big, beating heart the film remains an engrossing adventure story that will resonate with viewers of all ages.

Director Brad Bird's tale is set in a small town in Maine in the mid 50's during the height of the cold war which is no mistake since it provides the perfect backdrop for a culture of fear and misunderstanding to percolate.  It is into this tiny, rural community that a massive robotic creature crashes from space.  What is he?  Where is he from?  Those are questions that are left up to the viewer to decide.  The giant is befriended by young Hogarth, an inqisitive boy who teaches him what it means to be human, to have a soul and to do a cannonball into a lake, although not necessarily in that order.  Hogarth decides to keep his friend a secret from the townsfolk since he knows that they will react out of fear.  His plan gets derailed when special FBI agent Kent Mansley arrives in town to investigate the incident and decides to expose and destroy the giant.  Mansley claims to be acting in the interest of national security, but it is clear that he is trying to make a name for himself and further his career by taking advantage of tensions between the U.S and Russia as well as by playing the patriotism card.  As events escalate to a showdown between the giant and the military, the film also invites viewers to consider the shoot first/ask questions later mentality that seems to be a result of America's love affair with guns.

But politics aside, The Iron Giant is a fun and fast paced story that is ultimately about the friendship between a young boy and a misunderstood creature from another world.  That is where its heart lies and what makes it so endearing.  Everything else is just food for though.",1377216000,,2387,4.6052009456264775

1251919,5,B000028U3R,"There are times when a film fails in the theaters through no fault of its own -- not because it's a terrible film, but because the studio either failed to market it properly or didn't bother advertising it at all.  Such films generally slip into theaters relatively unannounced and end up being largely ignored by the movie-going populace.  Unlike a genuine bomb of a film, however, these unsung gems will often find a fanbase and be vindicated through home video release or airings on TV, and gain the recognition they deserve long after their theater run has come to an end.  (Yes, sometimes the occasional bomb gains a cult following after the fact, such as ""Showgirls"" or ""Zardoff,"" but these tend to be watched for the ""so bad they're good"" factor rather than any sort of quality...)

""The Iron Giant"" is one such film, one that arrived in theaters relatively unpromoted except for a few trailers, and made barely a ripple during its theatrical run.  But unlike many other films that have faded into obscurity, this film has found its niche through the home video market and become something of a classic... and quite deservedly so, as it's one of the most heartfelt animated films I've ever seen.

Set in the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine in the late 1950s, this film follows a boy and his robot -- young Hogarth, a young boy living with his single mother and who feels like an outcast due to being moved up a grade in school, and the titular Iron Giant, who crash-lands in the ocean and wanders into the woods around town, bereft of his memory and seeking food (metal) and a safe place to stay.  Hogarth stumbles across the giant late one night and ends up befriending him, teaching him about the world and finding sanctuary for him in a junkyard, run by the deadpan-snarker beatnik Dean.  Both Hogarth and Dean try to keep the giant occupied and hidden from an arrogant government agent who sees the giant as his ticket to gaining recognition for himself... but when said agent sics the US military on the giant, Hogarth must somehow prove the giant is benevolent, before the military can destroy him.

The animation in this film is fantastic.  A combination of traditional 2D animation and cel-shaded CGI, it manages to combine both elements very well for being a '90s animated feature.  The giant is well-rendered, highly detailed and not clashing horribly with the 2D characters and backgrounds.  And there's a wide variety of character designs in this film, which is quite appreciated when many animated films tend to fall back on three or four basic designs for their human characters.  And the 1950s setting of the film actually benefits it -- not only does this film capture the look and feel of the decade in its scenery, it helps drive the plot as well, as Cold-War paranoia and the Red Scare affect many people's attitude toward their unlikely alien invader.

The characters are also well-done, and in most cases quite likable.  Hogarth is a typical young boy, energetic and hungry for adventure, and while he can be a bit of a smartmouth at times he didn't come across as obnoxious -- he had plenty of kind and heartwarming moments.  The giant himself is -- there's no better word for it -- adorable, somewhat nave and innocent but endlessly curious, with just as much heart as any of the human characters.  Dean serves as a foil for the two main characters, sarcastic and something of a realist, and provides some of the film's funniest moments.  The government agent is the typical bad guy, out to hunt down the giant, but there are moments that show his desperate need for approval and validation, which give him some motivation for what he does (I like it when a film gives its villains more motivation than ""hahaha, I'm EVIL!"").  The minor characters -- Hogarth's mom, the general, and various townsfolk -- tend to only appear when they're needed for the plot, but they do get some good lines and are shown to be sympathetic characters in their own rights.

Some have complained that this film is an anti-gun, anti-military propaganda piece.  I respectfully disagree.  Yes, the army serves as one of the antagonists in this film, but the film is careful to show that the military is acting in what they see as the best interests of the people, and that they are willing to back down when necessary.  The anti-gun message is a little more heavy-handed, but in the end the overall message of the film seems to be that it's not what you are or what you're capable of, but what you choose to be and what you choose to do with what you can do, that's good or bad.  That's a message I can fully get behind -- just as the giant, for all his destructive capabilities, can choose whether to use his abilities for good or ill, so any member of society can choose what they do with what they have.

And maybe a minor spoiler here, but... this film brought me close to tears.  It manages to grip the heart that much, especially with its lovable robot character.

An underrated animation classic, this is a must-have for any animation fan.  Probably best for kids 10 and older due to some violence and language.",1369872000,,5126,4.640486725663717

The director and voice actors are terrific and it clearly comes through in this film. There is definitely enough adult humor and political commentary to keep adults interested while kids will fall in love with the innovative storyline and clean animation. I would probably recommend this movie to anyone I would even watch a movie with.,1365206400,,449,4.625

Maybe this sounds good to some but for a long time Prime customer, it is very disappointing and for Amazon's information, we refuse to pay for this movie!",1362787200,3,471,4.363636363636363

I resorted to watching the various news channels and all the reporting was about mans inhumanity towards man. Rape, murder, thievery, civil unrest, political bickering,car jacking,kidnapping,sexual predators and missing children and adults. There's nothing to take your mind off of all of that ""bad news"" like a lighthearted animated film, or a good roll in the hay with a hot partner :o)  Since the latter wasn't around, I settled for The Iron Giant. Great choice ! The story was simple and heartwarming with great animation. It looked like it was set around the 60's or so, in a small town. It brought back childhood memories of the many cartoons that I watched wayyyy back when I was just a wee lad. When you get a chance, watch this and enjoy.",1362614400,,913,4.635802469135802

1251972,5,B000028U3R,"Sadly, this is such a widely unknown movie to most people. Within the movie & entertainment business, however, it is highly regarded as one of the best animated films of all time. Such wonderful story, characters, art direction, plot development, & heart. A beautiful tale about a curious, lonely boy who discovers a friend when he's most in need of one. It's about friendship, humanity & the choices that make us who we are.
Set in the late 1950's, in small-town rural Maine, it shows a country deeply set in the Cold-War fear of the post WWII era. A hardworking single mother, a frustrated yet imaginative young boy, a dreaming artist turned apathetic, a narcissistic & bulldogged CIA agent, & an unexpectedly 'human' robot giant make up this cast of interesting characters.
I've seen it dozens of times myself & it doesn't get old, even when I have a toddler who is obsessed with it. Don't miss it!",1362182400,,901,4.708860759493671

The characters are quintessential without being cliched. I often don't expect animated films to mean much, but in many ways this one is as heartbreaking, hopeful, and beautiful as a film like The Shawshank Redemption--but not as gritty. It is also gorgeously drawn, combining traditional and CG animation seamlessly. I wouldn't show it to really young kids, but for those who aren't too sensitive to a couple scary images it's a great film for introducing topics like death, fear of the unknown, unlikely friendship, acceptance of difference, using one's abilities for the good of others, love, and sacrifice.

So in response to some of the other reviews:

""Not appropriate for small children..Fill in the age..""  My children did not watch any TV until they were at least 3 years old.  For the maximum of 2 hours a week, they were stuck to PBS, Playhouse Disney, Nick Jr and videos until 10-12. They watched this at around 6-8 and loved it!  Me too!  They now watch a huge array of movies genre.  They play video games, get good grades and are Eagle Scouts.  They are perfectly normal children - the eldest accepted into a very competitive university film program.  Not one of them was traumatized by this movie.  We thought it showed compassion, understanding and friendship.  It encourages the imagination.

Don't show it to your 0-4 year old - they don't need to be watching TV anyway!  Play with them!

""It is Anti-everything!"" As a person I am very pro- military, pro-gun, pro-hunting etc. Yes,in this movie, one crazy governmental bureaucratic causes all of the trouble.  Yes, children often do not like seeing forest animals killed, but that is normal.  In the end the military did the right thing by listening to reason and stood down.  I thought they were made to look reasonable.  My children understand that movies have villains.  They have been taught to understand the difference between one bad apple and a whole organization.

1252081,5,B000028U3R,"How might a completely paranoid, post-war America react to an overwhelmingly powerful invader from space during the height of the Cold War in the fall of 1957?

That's the question asked in The Iron Giant, and this 1999 animated film, now a true cult classic, is probably one of the most intellectually and emotionally moving science-fiction tales one could hope to find. This award-winning but critically ignored feature animation debut from director Brad Bird combined a then-infant CGI style with traditional hand-drawn animation, was skillfully adapted from the late British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes' 1968 novel, The Iron Man, which was a gem in itself. It features the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and John Mahoney, and it's a film that my then-young son and I first watched together on television, then immediately ordered on DVD here.

This film is about a lonely boy named Hogarth (Eli Marienthal) raised by his widowed and single mother (Jennifer Aniston), who discovers an iron giant (Vin Diesel )who fell from space into the Maine woods. Helped by a beatnik artist and junkyard owner named Dean (Harry Connick, Jr.), a man who ""sees art where others see junk,"" the voices of these animated characters have been cast perfectly. The Iron Giant is a fifty-foot, metal-eating robot which reacts defensively if it recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it, but can stop himself. Hogarth and Dean have to stop the U.S. military and an arrogant, ambitious and paranoid federal agent (Christopher McDonald) from finding and destroying the Giant.

The film is spellbinding, and though it was never a commercial success; in fact, it flopped in 1999 but remains one of the smartest and most profoundly moving sci-fi films ever made. My title to this review was taken from a dialogue that I had to explain to my son, where Hogarth was explaining to the Iron Giant that though he was made of metal, he had feelings, thought about things, and that meant that the Giant had a soul: ""And souls don't die."" After Hogarth left, the Giant laid back and looked at the stars and said: ""Souls don't die.""

Bought The Iron Giant here years ago on DVD, because we wanted a permanent copy, but luckily it's available as an Amazon Instant Video, and if you haven't yet seen the film, it's worth it... and one to share together with your kids.

The reason for The Iron Giant's success isn't hard to discern - it has to do with the writing. The script is crisp, smartly-paced, intelligent, and emotionally satisfying. It recalls the strengths of E.T. without the weaknesses. It introduces real, likable characters worth caring about and rooting for. It's the kind of story with the power to engross 6-year olds and 60-year olds alike because it doesn't condescend. The Iron Giant is filled with small moments that only older viewers will get, but which pass so quickly that kids won't realize they have missed anything. The filmmakers responsible for The Iron Giant, particularly director Brad Bird, recognize that the best animated features appeal to a wide variety of audience members, not just the pre-teen set, and have used that philosophy as the picture's cornerstone.",1340582400,,1042,4.920454545454546

This cartoon is different from its Disney counterparts, because there is no political correctness involved. The film takes place in the Cold-War era, and accurately shows the tension and fear that citizens were going through at the time. The plot is quite intricate, as a boy named Hogarth finds a giant tangled in a power station. He later bring the ""Iron Giant"" home to the dismay of his mother. Throughout this, a government agent is on Hogarth's back the entire time, searching for the giant. The themes presented at the end of the movie are thought-provoking, and leaves the film on a sort of cliffhanger; while at the same time tying up loose ends.

1252116,5,B000028U3R,"The core of the film is somewhat of an ""E.T."" type of story in the sense that a kid befriends an alien. But what really made this work were the issues discussed within the film along with the film's time period. For a ""kid movie"" (I use that somewhat lightly), The Iron Giant talks about death, complex and difficult choices, and our sometimes xenophobic tendencies.

Yes, this is still a kid movie at heart, but that doesn't mean that there's not plenty for adults to enjoy as well. The humor was well presented without dumbing it down for the 5yr old crowd. The story has a logical flow, the animation was well done, and there is genuine emotion witnessed before us.

As for whether or not the content is suitable for kids in the first place (I've read plenty of bickering within the reviews section regarding this), I'll leave that up to your own parental judgment. Just keep in mind that this is a kid movie that challenges kids to think and ask questions about issues that MAY be complex to children. However, not every kid movie needs 5 musical parts, talking animals, farts, and a world completely made from sugar cane...

They end up being hunted down by the government and, in the process, form an unbreakable friendship. I personally thought that the kid (Hogarth), who befriends the Giant, is a bit on the obnoxious side, as he yells quite a bit throughout the movie. The Iron Giant is okay. He reminds me of Iron Man and a Transformer at the same time, so not entirely original, but whatever. The story sometimes feels like it takes a few detours, but it remains the same: hide the Giant robot as long as you can! But, we all know in the end that the robot is exposed and then there's explosions and I'll let you see how it ends. The reason I gave it a 3/5 stars is because of the obvious anti-gun propaganda in the movie. Phrases like ""guns kill"" and ""I'm not a gun"" made me frown. In my opinion, guns don't kill; it's people who kill, they just happened to use a gun to do it. Anyway, this movie has good animation and a decent story that left room for a sequel at the end. Unless you're pro-gun control, I'd be cautious about your kids watching this movie and getting the idea that guns are bad.",1331510400,5,1232,4.314655172413793

befriends them, understanding they're not the threat the grown up world
thinks), Brad Bird brings humor, freshness and heart to the sub-genre
that lets this transcend into a terrific movie.

Set in a cold-war paranoid America of 1957, the titular creature cash
lands from outer- space, with a knock on his giant metal head leaving
him with amnesia about his purpose or history. After being saved by a 9
year old boy, a series of at first comic, then later more serious
adventures begin.

There's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and some
terrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom more
interesting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a local
wanna-be beatnik artist who joins in to take the giant iron man's
cause.

I love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there's
something wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they do
a great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metal
creature.

The military, as opposed to other reviews, are not stupid, but trying to protect the citizenry. They are misled by an overzealous and misguided government agent.

The details are not just in the shadows, lighting, but goes to a level of subtle scratches on a diner counter top, Iron giants cross section and assembly of hands and fingers (visible when it rebuilds itself) ...

1252132,5,B000028U3R,"In 1999, in the midst of a summer movie season that included Star Wars: Episode One (gag), The Sixth Sense, and Disney's Tarzan, the people at Warner Bros. made a critical error in marketing and released one of the finest animated films in history to little or no fanfare. It's poor box office reception is a direct result. However, poor box office is not a tell tale sign of a film's greatness. History is replete with film classics that performed poorly (The Shawshank Redemption, Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, and A Christmas Story to name a few classics that fall under this category).

Based on a book by Ted Hughes and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Family Dog), The Iron Giant is among the rarest of modern animated films as it's heart is at the very core of the film. It is earnest and moving in a way that isn't force fed and emotes without the typical ""tugging on the heart string"" devices.

It's the story of Hogarth Hughes, who lives with his single Mom in Maine of the late Fifties. The cold war is in full swing and McCarthy era paranoia is rampant.

Enter the Giant...

Crash landed, damaged (or wounded), and alone, the Giant makes his way through the Maine country side eating cars and other scraps of metal. He's lost, alone, and hungry. He's the epitome of a ""stranger in a strange land"". It is in the midst of his misadventures that he finds himself in a spot of trouble when tangled up in the cables of the local powerplant. Hogarth, although frightened, frees the Giant and it's not long before they develop a strong bond of friendship.

Their troubles come in the form of Special Agent Kent Mansley (masterfully voiced by Christopher McDonald), who is brought to town to investigate the sightings of the ""metal man"". Riddled with misguided patriotism and McCarthy like ignorance, he sets out on a mission to find the Giant and take it down, no matter the cost.

The basic subtext of the film is the love between a boy and a weapon with a heart. The Giant learns about the ills of violence in a way that isn't overbearing or preachy...but powerful and incredibly well written.

The voice talents include Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr., among others. In my opinion, this film ranks right up there among anything Disney has ever offered and far superior than anything Dreamworks has ever done. It is a SOLID story and it is near impossible to walk away unmoved. In all honesty, I can't watch it without a lump in my throat at certain points.

Seeing ""The Iron Giant"" in a theater again shortly after the 2011 tsunami in Japan, the scene where the Giant jumps into a lake causing a huge wave that washes two of the characters and a slew of fish onto a roadway and into a tree affected the audience in ways I'm sure Bird never intended.

When those parts came around where you think 'I bet this happens next', I managed to be so engrossed in this tale that I convinced myself I had no idea what was going on. It reminds me of the fantasy and wonder that I had as a child exploring the woods of my neighborhood, and really made me feel like a kid again.

Some may not find this completely appropriate for small kids. There's guns, it mentions death, and some go so far as to claim that the tone of the movie is anti-military. While I disagree with any anti-military agenda, I can agree that a few points could be scary for kids; but if they've seen Toy Story 3, then they can handle anything. If you enjoyed this story, I'd recommend the animated film How To Train Your Dragon. Both movies that really bring out the kid in you.",1318896000,,878,4.195266272189349
1252146,5,B000028U3R,"""Robot!  Robot!,"" I hear almost daily from my toddler, his request that I put on ""The Iron Giant"" DVD.  A very cute movie, with a touching story, quality animation, and good voice work.  As much as it plays in our house, I can't say I'm exhausted of it yet.

** EDIT **

I didn't intend to get long-winded on this review, but after reading other reviews and considering their points, I thought I would expand a little, here.

My 2-year-old is our third child.  Raising three children, I have learned to be a more liberal parent over time, through both experience and necessity.  My first child would have never been allowed to watch this movie at 2 years old because of the violence and guns, and admittedly, I was squeamish about my youngest watching it at first.  But monitoring him carefully, and considering the other standards and rules we have in our home, I was impressed to see him empathize with the sad parts, frighten when it was scary, and laugh at the many funny moments.  In the end, I decided that his level of joy and excitement far outweighed the negativity of the violence, as it is portrayed.

To be fair, there are guns, there is violence, there is some mildly questionable language, there are some arguably adult situations, and there are morals that won't align completely with every family's beliefs.  As an adult, you might read political and personal opinions into how the story is told, but I frankly think reviews that rant on this are misguided, not wholly embracing the entertainment factor of the storytelling.  If you can make a judgement, as a parent and for your family's beliefs, based off of this information, then you need no more.

My opinion is that the animations and visuals are beautiful, the voice acting is top-notch, and that love, caring, and friendship far outweigh the violent aspects of the story.",1318377600,2,1845,4.707165109034268

The story does tend to lean a certain way, like against war and weapons , but if you just watch it as a cartoon movie , and realise there are no real iron giants , then you can enjoy it.

Not on the theories of war and integrity, but questions such as ""why are they shooting at him"" Answer: ""Because they think he is bad and don't understand he is good"".  And at the end of the movie...""See boys, now they understand"". Case closed.  They were satisfied. It is an intense movie but their little minds don't absorb just the 'guns' and bad things that others have reviewed.  My boys noticed and voiced their opinion clearly about the good decisions and bad decisions...the 5th time the watched it.

The story, for the most part, was well done and the voice acting was top notch!  However, I have a bone to pick with this story.  You see I just saw this movie for the first time, I did not see it when it first came out.
This movie is made for children, however, the story demonizes firearms and the people who own them.  We have a scene that shows a deer getting shot by hunters and then because it's Hollywood, they show how sad it is that the poor innocent deer was shot by the evil hunters.  Never mind that some people need deer meat to feed their families.  This becomes a metaphor for later in the movie when the Iron Giant decides that he's not a gun, that he's not ""evil"".  Like I said the whole movie is a set up to teach children that firearms and the people who own them are evil.  Don't ya just love how Hollywood spreads discrimination?
All that and I haven't touched on the anti-military theme that was so condescending to the US military and the men and women who serve in it.
That's why I'm giving this movie only two stars.  So, parents if your worried about your children getting into firearms, maybe you should teach them that firearms are not toys?  Don't rely on Hollywood to do your job for you.  Raise your children yourself.

PS:  Yes I own several firearms.  No I have not shot a family member, I have not committed any violent crimes, and I'm not evil.",1289174400,10,1505,4.283687943262412

Today's children's movies are all overly commercialized and bland. Animated Baxter Bunny loses his family, meets new friends, has wacky adventures, and finally, learns a moral. Get your Baxter Bunny toy with your happy meal! Iron Giant is the exact opposite. This movie has a rich plot, great voice acting, beautiful animation and most importantly, heart. You actually care about the characters and root for them.

This is a great movie for all ages. Just be forewarned. This movie may have heart, but it also has dark moments. It deals with both death and the choices you make. It's a safe kind of dark movie for kids, but be aware that it is more than a lighthearted tale of a boy and his giant.",1286928000,2,951,4.621301775147929

It portrays US military commanders as unthinking, stubborn, reactionary thugs who are responsible for war and injustice.

I saw officers that drifted in that direction as a Marine intelligence analyst in the 1980s, but they were rare, disrespected, deadened in their careers and they were still never this bad. This filmmaker imagines them to me in charge of our forces, I'm sure there's no shortage mislead people who agree, but it's not reality.

US commanders are nowhere near perfect, but on average they are equal to or better than the business executives that I've worked with in management and IT consulting in hearthcare in terms of ethics and judgment. This film's portrayal of them is juvenile and misleading.

Years ago I needed to rent a movie to keep my 2 young children amused on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
We had already seen the Disney classics like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Then I happened to see The Iron Giant DVD and remembered that the reviews were favorable but from watching the trailers I had formed an opinion that the animation style couldn't compare to the latest Disney films and that this cartoon was probably a B movie at best. But I was desperate and hoped the kids, who should have been juvenile movie critics, wouldn't be too hard on their father for his selection.
After the first five minutes I was thinking that I had probably made a mistake and was waiting to get grief from the kids, but as the end credits were rolling and the end music was playing I was wiping a few tears from my eyes and the kids were demanding to watch it again.
I won't get into the plot except to say that it's a great story for both young and old and the animation style took me back to Saturday afternoons spent at sci-fi double features at the Palace Theater watching such films as Forbidden Planet and This Island Earth and cartoons from the 40's such as the old Max Fleischer Superman cartoons.

A wholly overrated film which has good intentions but never manages to get the feel of the 1950s right or shake the feeling that it's basically a retelling of E.T. with an ""iron giant"" instead of a muppet (lonely boy without a father finds a sweet and gentle creature from another world and makes friends with it but the evil government agents want it for their own shadowy purposes), the Iron Giant further suffers from weak voice acting and the requisite poop jokes;  ultimately the film emerges as something considerably less than the classic it's made out to be.

1252195,5,B000028U3R,"The essence of the ""The Iron Giant"" is the genuine friendship that develops between young Hogarth [Eli Marienthal] and the Iron Giant [Vin Diesel], a hulking fighter robot that crashes onto Earth and 'forgets' his real purpose, i.e. a killing machine. When Hogarth discovers the Iron Giant, the pair form a true friendship, beginning from the moment Hogarth saves the IG from being short-circuited by electrical cables to the end, when it is the IG's turn to prove his allegiance and love for his human friend. Despite the fantasy premise, there is just something so incredibly genuine and heartwarming in this story that appeals to me, even after all these years since its release back in '99 and I was so happy when my 4.5-year-old liked it too, which goes to show this is an animated feature that can appeal to a broad range of ages.

1252209,3,B000028U3R,"Perhaps in part due to the fact that the film bombed at the box office, The Iron Giant has developed quite a cult around it in recent years.  Some of the enthusiasm is justified--the animation is quite impressive and the story appealing--but the movie does not work as well as its defenders would have one believe.

The biggest problem with The Iron Giant lies with the fact that the entire movie feels like a less-witty animated remake of E.T.  Think about it--lonely boy from a fatherless home stumbles upon a sweet and gentle creature from another world and bonds with the strange being, ultimately facing off against government agents who want the creature for their own purposes.  While obviously some details differ, the movie has the feel of something we've seen before.  Additionally, though set in the 1950s the movie never really gets the details of the era right.  Cold War paranoia is fairly easy to drum up, but almost every character (especially the poorly-essayed main character and the psuedo-Beatnik) sounds as if he or she was lifted from the 1990s.

All things considered, The Iron Giant is probably not a waste of time or money, but it is also not the brilliant work of cinema that many of its supporters claim it to be.",1228176000,5,1240,4.73953488372093

Set during the Cold War, this is the story of young Hogarth Hughes who is not only cursed with that awful name but a gifted mind that has popped into an older grade where he is tormented by bullies.  His single mom works as a waitress, so Hogarth is pretty much on his own until an adventure leads him to discover a giant robot that happens to have no idea why he is there.  What he is? Where did he come from? What is his mission?  Such questions are thrown to the back as Hogarth makes his first real friend and is lead on a myriad of further adventures.  As for the Giant, does his purpose matter in comparison to what he wants for himself?

These themes are explored through some truly three-dimensional characters: Hogarth's mom (voiced wonderfully by the lovely Jennifer Aniston), a local junk artist/beatnik, a villainous government agent sent to see what all the fuss is.

This movie is an emotional and animation gem that is so underappreciated it's not funny.",1222473600,,1351,4.463414634146342

Like most young boys when they come across a giant robot is to make friends with it. Now he has to keep him hidden from a worrysome mother and paranoid government agent. This is one of the most heartfelt movies I have ever seen and it's not even a Disney movie. The characters are so well made and voices chosen really allow them to connect with the viewers. I loved how the movie really depicted the time of the innocent 1950's with all the pop culture references as well.

It does accomplish the requisite jerking of tears, but it's actually much more than an animated kid's movie.  Bird has said in interviews that he regards animation as a medium, not a genre; that's true nowhere more than here.  TIG functions as a parable on several levels:  an object lesson on the evils of xenophobia, a Christ allegory on love and self-sacrifice, and a lesson in self-determination (""You are...what YOU choose to be.  YOU choose.  Choose."").  Whether or not it was intended as all of the above, it works beautifully, and the emotional punch of the climactic scene never quite wears off, even after numerous viewings.

1252227,4,B000028U3R,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

Friendship. Love. Respect. Growing up. These are the themes that run throughout THE IRON GIANT, an Oscar Award winning animated film from 1999. Kids films without substance are very familiar to most parents, but The Iron Giant harkens back to a time when family and friendship meant everything.

Although unusual in the sense that a boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) befriends an alien robot simply called The Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Find-Me-Guilty/dp/B000FFJ826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Find Me Guilty</a>), this animated feature still teaches kids the responsibilities of friendship and how devastating it can be to lose one.

The set-up is common in that we see the military and government agents as bumbling morons who misunderstand the intentions of something as large and as powerful as a nearly indestructible robot. But understanding eventually reaches them, too, through the actions of Hogarth and his new alien buddy.

More interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers ...as well as a fatal ending (sort of). Parents should be prepared to comfort their kids when The Iron Robot launches himself into space in preparation to save his best friend (Hogarth). The words ""Superman"" are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words.

But there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones. Watching fellow humans complain to the local constabulary about suddenly absent mouthfuls of trucks, towers, and other metal munchables is pretty comical, as is a great scene where The Iron Giant does a cannonball jump into a favorite swimming hole of Hogarth's.

The animation is amazing......the CG parts were well blended with the 2D (you can check the extra disc for extras...it even has a segment on Vin Diesel, who was the voice of the iron giant).  They used the same coloring for both CG and 2D which helped them look uniform.

The movie had some really funny lines, and the story was really good for both children and adults.  Some of the animation was a little strange (the voice acting didn't always match up to the moving mouths on the characters) but the storytelling is what matters the most, and the honest emotions and overall enjoyment from the characters made this movie one I highly recommend watching with your children.

What cracked me up the most was the train scene.  The robot/alien decided he wanted to eat the train tracks, but a train was coming at that very moment, so he quickly had to hurry up and put the tracks back down the way they were!

1252239,5,B000028U3R,"It's 1957 in Maine. The Cold War is heating up and people are getting paranoid about Russia especially with Sputnik orbiting the earth. Hogarth lives in a wooded area outside a small Maine community with his single mother who works long hours in a restaurant. This gives Hogarth plenty of time to explore and develop his imagination. There is a crash nearby in the woods and rumors start about some giant creature. When Hogarth is watching TV alone at night the picture suddenly turns to snow. Hogarth climbs up on the roof to adjust the antenna only to find part of it missing. He sees a trail of destruction and follows it to the nearest power station where Hogarth finds the unconscious Iron Giant, a 50 foot tall robot like character who must find metal and lots of it to eat to survive. Trying to eat a chunk of the high voltage tower was bad for indigestion. Hogarth saves his life and the adventure begins of trying to protect this friendly giant from the community and a very paranoid government agent determined to destroy first and ask questions later. Unfortunately, many people will skip this wonderful film because it is animated. Don't make that mistake. It's as entertaining for adults as it is for children, particularly if you remember the days of Sputnik, the Cold War, etc. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM",1195171200,,1320,4.793859649122807

In the dawn of the Cold War, a 9 year old boy named Hogarth, forms a strong friendship with a gigantic metal-eating robot from space. When a  government agent arrives to investigate strange events in town, Hogarth must protect his friend from the US military.

1252243,5,B000028U3R,"What an absolutely amazing animated movie. I was flipping the cable channels one day years ago and came across this movie purely by accident. I've never been a big cartoon person at all. While other kids were watching Saturday morning cartoons I was busy watching science and educational programs. So a cartoon movie is not something that I normally stopped and watched at all as a first choice.

I remember tuning is when the giant was walking through the woods with Hogarth and I watched for a few minutes and was quickly drawn in and that was that.

I caught it from the beginning next time it was on and I could not believe what a greeat movie this was. This has to be one of the best animated movies of all time, right up there with Toy Story and others like it.

The balance of humor, character depth, a budding romance between Hogarths mom and Dean, the sweet innocence and humility of the robot itself and how he CHOOSES to be more like Superman and sacrifice himself for his friends and loved ones is a classic and all to rare trait today, whether in a human or a machine.

I've never found anyone that didn't like this movie once they've seen it. All my brothers in their 30's and 40's were deeply moved by the sweetness, action, comedy, suspense and great animation in this movie.

If you've never seen this before, then it's a definitely MUST see for all ages, just beware as the previous poster mentioned about a couple of rather inappropriate words used such as ""hell"" and such. Other than that this movie is absolutely perfect and one that I enjoy watching over and over again.

1252247,5,B000028U3R,"I first saw this movie in the theatre in Japan (animation capital of the world that it is), and watched it several times since then on DVD.  I love the feel and style of this movie, but what I mostly love is the comparative reactions to the Iron Giant by Hogarth versus his progressively adult and responsible counterparts.

Hogarth isn't the least bit scared of the giant--he thinks it's really cool--and after some initial fear, so does his super cool adult, artist friend Dean.  But Hogarth knows the adults would freak out if they knew, and so tries to hide and protect his robot friend from the adults.

Enter an overeager and overzealous government representative who is most fond of telling people he's important because he's from the government. His chief concern in life is finding any incursion of the 'commies' on US soil, and when he suspects a robot from space may be on the loose, he jumps to the conclusion that it must be Russian.  If he can only confirm this, he can really live his ultimate fantasy--calling in the Army to blast the thing out of existence.

Hogarth teaches the robot human values from a child's perspective, and ends up saving everyone from what might have been the end of humanity--but without really knowing it.  Hogarth just wants his friend, the robot, to live, be happy, and not be harmed or cause harm to anyone.

Hogarth has natural morals.  He knows what's good and bad without considering good and evil.  Even if the robot had a 'Made in Russia' label on it, Hogarth would have helped, befriended, and did his best to teach it right and wrong all the same.  His character is a nice refresher for us jaded adults and our thousands of issues.

All of the above aside, it's a very entertaining movie which couldn't be safer for your children to watch, and adults will be thrown back into how they thought as children.",1188086400,4,1858,4.613981762917933

The only movies that rival it are the classics, such as Snow White, Cinderella, Bambi, Fantasia, etc.  I'll definitely put it in my top 2, with Transformers being #1 -tough decision, since I grew up with TF.  I'd love to see this on a big screen some day and I regret missing it in theaters.  When this becomes a classic, which I'm sure it will, it will be well deserved.

The Gian't ISN'T done with CGI, and instead they used good old-fashioned 2-d art. Wonderfull. Look at the shading in the forest- the way the trees move... everything is fantastic to look at. A real piece of eye-candy.

But that's not the ONLY thing that attracts me to the iron giant. Nope. The story is wonderful, especialy towards the end of the feature, about a boy and a giant, and how they come to understand one another, and things like death. It's touching, and maybe a bit sad.

There are some stupid-funny moments, but nothing that's as bad as what's been in the theaters latley. Nope.

The DVD itself has an interesting commentary, and the deleted scenes really should have been kept in there!

Another thing that gives this movie points in my book is that it takes place in Maine. I live in Maine and we don't get too many movies that take place here. Especially not animated films.

1252255,5,B000028U3R,"The down side: This is much too scary for young children.  It's not a fluffy, sugar-coated, toy-robot flick.

The up side: Pretty much everything else.  The pre-Pixar animation is beautiful (it will look primitive to those raised on digital animation, but the drawings are lovely).  The human characters are adequate: I wouldn't say I particularly care about any of them, but the robot is what really matters and the humans--Hogarth in particular--do well enough in supporting roles.  There are some goofy slapstick things but they are trimming on the bigger story.  I saw one review complained about ""toilet humor"" but there are only one or two gags and they are much milder than anything Disney has released in the past ten years.

The robot-and-boy element will appeal to older children and the more complex elements will appeal to those of us who are old enough to remember the Cold War.  The overall message is about violence and choice (it probably means more in 2007 than it did even in 1999, really).",1183593600,,1008,4.853801169590644
1252256,5,B000028U3R,"This is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.  Though exciting in places the movie is never really scary since it soon becomes apparent that the giant is a friendly, helpful creation that needs to be protected by Hogarth not feared.  The 1950's setting is well realized from the Cold War fears to the kids' obsession with superhero comic books.  Several important themes are examined including the value of non-violence, the eternity of the soul and tolerance for beings that seem different. Some of these themes are presented subtly and others not so subtly.  Despite the sometimes serious ideas presented there are many scenes that are ""laugh out loud"" funny.
The movie is welled voiced with Harry Connick Jr. perfect as Dean the beatnik/artist/scrap dealer and Jennifer Aniston  as Hogarth's attractive mother.  Hogarth is fully developed as a smart kid missing his dad, and enduring resentment from his less intelligent peers.  The movie is adapted from Ted Hughes' children's novella of the same name and though both are well rendered they are vastly different from each other.  As some other Amazon reviewers have noted this film is correctly rated PG not G for some mild cursing, intense moments and some humor involving a practical joke with a laxative.",1181865600,,1289,5.018779342723005

I have to say that, compared to the silly pictures and cheapquels Disney was churning out during the same time period (except for the excellent Fantasia 2000), this is really good. It does not have talking animals, or stupid songs sung by the main characters, so it's safe to invite friends in their 30's or 40's to watch it.

It's true that it does have some violence, but it's not of the bloody kind, and most children won't be disturbed by it.

It's a good movie. I really like it. All the moments are good ones, and Hogarth is a kid I can empathise with. The Giant has a few good lines, too. The one I remember is, ""I am not a gun."" Despite his shocking and awesome array of built-in weaponry, he also has a mind that can choose. Perhaps it sounds simplistic and shallow, perhaps because it is, but that moment of choice has huge meaning in my life. I really want kids to see it so that, when the question comes up, they know what it means.

This is a light movie, but one worth seeing. The animation is ordinary, but today's standards mean that ordinary is quite good. A few of the visual gags are very clever, too. There are lots of worse ways to spend a rainy weekend - enjoy!

There are two sequences that were cut from the final version (included in this special addition!) that I believe should have been kept in order to make the fundamental message of the movie--the giant's function in the narrative--more clear and complete.  I don't really consider these spoilers because they aren't in the actual movie!

The first is the ""campfire"" scene, where Hogart and Dean are discussing ""the meaning of life.""

Hogart:  ""I wish I knew where he came from and why he's here.""

Dean: ""Are you kidding?  I wish I knew why *I'm* here.""

The second is the giant's dream sequence during his night at the junkyard, where it transmits itself as a signal to Dean's TV.  It is a biographical nightmare where the giant starts remembering his origin and original purpose.

From these it is much more obvious to conclude that the giant is the projection and manifestation of people's ignorance and fear and also their hopes and dreams.  In short, he represents both the best and worst potentials that we as people can create for ourselves.  He is also a reminder that any conflict requires two willing participants--even if one initially drags the other unwillingly into the mix.  In order to stop the conflict, start the healing and realize our truest potentials, someone has to be the ""bigger person.""

1252274,5,B000028U3R,"This wonderful animated classic is based on a children's book by the late British poet laureate, Ted Hughes (who drove two wives to suicide--Sylvia Plath and, six years later, Assia Welville, who also murdered her child). But neither kids nor the grown-ups who see this film need know about Hughes, or the Cold War, during which Hughes created this allegory to demonstrate the evil of war.

Hughes gave his book's characters very little development. Hogarth, the boy who centers the movie, is the central character. But there's not much explanation (here, or in the book) about why he acts, or why anyone acts, for that matter.

Nevertheless, the plot and fantastic cartoon art and music will draw kids and adults alike into this tangle of fantasy. The film, in a way, even reproduces some of the book's poetic language, in pictures.  Hughes wrote of the music of the spheres--the music that space made, a strange soft music, deep and weird, like millions of voices singing together. Here, the spheres come alive in the giant's body parts, and the beatnik artist who helps Hogarth.

The Iron Giant came to the top of a cliff one night, no one knows how, why, or from where. The film also recreates the wind, which Hughes wrote, sang through his iron fingers, and his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin but big as a bedroom, slowly turned right, then slowly turned left. Down the cliff he fell, his iron legs, arms and ears breaking loose and falling off as he went. The pieces scattered, crashed, bumped, clanged down onto the rocky beach far below, where the sound of the sea chewed away at it, and the pieces of the Iron Giant lay scattered far and wide, silent and unmoving.

The Giant eats metal, and ends up safe from government agents--for a time at least--in the local scrap yard, where he could eat tractors and cars to his heart's content.

But the government agents are after the Giant, and eventually start a war by firing upon him. The film does not end the same way as the book, but it's fun, anyway.

But one important point, for grown-ups at least, remains the same: In creating his 1968 Cold War space-bat-angel-dragon, the erstwhile pacifist poet Hughes also created a vision of evil incarnate--the kind of evil that wishes to engulf the entire world, that cannot be reasoned with, cannot be pacified and must be fought. Ironic, isn't it?

The Iron Giant works at many levels: as an amazing piece of animation, as an entertaining childrens' story, as a family movie, but also as deeply moving addition to an already rich trove of Catholic Eucharistic theology.  The image of a great man from above coming to the earth, learning to love the creatures he meets, being touched by the death he sees around him, with a great power to save others from their own sins inside him but he sets it aside--chooses to set it aside--because of what he has learned about self-sacrificing love.  And let's not forget the whole ""Body of Christ"" and Communion analogy that is so powerfully portrayed in the final scene (right down to the star in the sky that is a sign that salvation has come).  The coming together of the entire body.

I ended up seeing this film 10 times in theatres over a two-month period. The film's trailer initially brought it to my attention. After I saw THE IRON GIANT on opening day, I had to see again and again and so fourth. Needless to say, I liked the film very much. I consider it one of my favorite films. Why? That is not an easy answer. All I can say is that I genuinely consider this to be a GOOD film and it has some enigmatic heartfelt intrinsic value to many that see it. It is not just a kid's film. It is not just a family film. It is a film for everyone. After my second or third viewing in theatres, I became interested in the audience's reactions. There was always a cheer or a sniffle or a shed tear rolling down a cheek. I remember one father saying to a gang of kids when the movie was over, ""That was a good one. We should have taken mommy with us."" I thought I was alone in my reaction to this film. After I got hooked up to the Internet, I found that there were literally thousands of people who were also moved by this film.

1252282,1,B000028U3R,"This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it.

Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's ""pet"" squirrel escape his pants to the ""bathroom"" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call ""toilet-bowl humor."" Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call ""amiable,"" ""heart-warming,"" or even ""cute""; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe ""artist"" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust.

Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a ""special edition"" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing.",1158105600,14,4530,4.881818181818182

That is not an easy answer. All I can say is that I genuinely consider this to be a GOOD film and it has some enigmatic heartfelt intrinsic value to many that see it. It is not just a kid's film. It is not just a family film. It is a film for everyone. After my second or third viewing in theatres, I became interested in the audience's reactions. There was always a cheer or a sniffle or a shed tear rolling down a cheek. I remember one father saying to a gang of kids when the movie was over, ""That was a good one.

1252288,5,B000028U3R,"I am not generally a fan of animated movies, and when I saw the ad campaign for ""The Iron Giant"" I had zero plans of seeing it. Fortunately for me it was given to me as a gift, and instead of a typical piece of animated feel-good flotsam, I was delighted to discover a brilliantly conceived and animated film with great subtlety and nuance.

The Iron Giant comes from space during a storm off the coast of Maine in the 1950s, during the height of cold war hysteria. He is befriended by the comically named Hogarth Hughes through a series of improbable events. The story metaphorically becomes a struggle between good and evil, yet never becomes jingoistic or propagandistic. If you have dry eyes at the end of the film you are not human, which speaks to the power of really good animation and filmmaking in general.

The voices (Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Vin Diesel, John Mahoney, etc.) are all perfect for their roles, and the animation is truly breathtaking. This is better than anything Disney has made in the last twenty years or so, and Warner Brothers should be proud of this film and use it as a model for what a truly good animated picture can be.

Finally, to dispel a rumor, although this film is suitable for kids, it is not a ""kid's movie,"" as it raises many important issues and deals with them in a very adult fashion. Although children will enjoy the film, expect it to generate major questions from them. In that regard, it does most parents a service in introducing difficult concepts (such as love, friendship, and death) in a marvelous way. Some of the humor will slide right past younger children, but never fear, the adults will love it.

1252290,5,B000028U3R,"A lot of people know Brad Bird's name now because of Pixar's 6th film he directed, the Incredibles. To animation geeks, he did the Family Dog segment from Spielberg's Amazing Stories and he was a creative consultant/director on Simpsons. In the middle though he wrote/directed the Iron Giant, which Warner Brothers had no idea how to market and the film bombed in the box office, not even making its budget back. However the film became incredibly popular afterwards and there's even a 24-hour marathon of the film played every year.

Hogarth and his mom Annie are living on their own in the 1950's. One night during a storm, something from space crash lands in the ocean and makes its way to a port town in the forest. Turns out it's a giant robot that Hogarth finds and befriends, teaching him how to speak(kinda) and teaching him some lessons. These lessons will need to be used since a government agent named Mansley is after it and sure that it's a destructive thing, which it might be.

Looking at the Iron Giant, it's easy to tell how Warner Brothers messed up its marketing: it's hard to label the film. The film's animated so it automatically would be kid friendly but it's not something that kids will find funny and colorful since there's no songs and there's no comic relief talking donkeys. It's a more mature story that happens to be animated so most adults will probably bypass it. But it's the themes that will appeal to everyone whether they're too ""macho"" or they're not young enough to understand it.

What makes the film work is the film's heart and its tone. It never panders to the audience and tries to make it too sympathetic(which plagues a lot of this Oscar wannabe films) and it's likable without being dull. It's also got a great ending which gives you a sense of closure without being a cop-out saccharine ending. The animation isn't as top notch as the CG features but you don't ever care since it's very well done and considering the budget they had and the amount of time, you're surprised by how much bad shots you're least likely to find.

Story and characters are important and the story's great enough but the characters shine through as well. Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, Eli Marienthal(previously known as Stifler's brother in American Pie) both give exceptional performances, as well as Vin Diesel who gives a likability to the titular giant with a deep voice without being James Earl Jones style deep.

If you're a fan of the Incredibles, you'll see Brad Bird's 2nd feature was the obvious talent still left over from Iron Giant and you owe it to yourself to watch this.",1141430400,10,2640,4.718004338394794

full of star-eyed wonder and narrative tension, is
the mark which distinguishes the finest authors in
any field. It is a particular command for those who
have mastered the field of animated cartoons, an
idiom which too many still dismiss as unworthy
""kidvid"" material.

Introduce any such skeptic to the work of director
Brad Bird, and the odds are that you will see such
skepticism fade like grey clouds from a sunlit sky.
Bird, whose roots in the field began with some fine
work for THE SIMPSONS, and has grown into Oscar-winning
narrative as showcased by THE INCREDIBLES, first met
the challenge of feature animation with his ingenious
treatment of poet Ted Hughes' single prose work.

There can be no doubt that THE IRON GIANT stands on its
own as a masterpiece in any genre. A wicked piece of
Science Fiction which may find some thinking of THE DAY
THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE IRON GIANT is the other side
of the saga. This time, it's Gort's tale, as we marvel
at how a skyscraper-high, space-faring, weapon-toting
robot can draw upon human virtue more than those
appointed to safeguard human liberty.

A withering comment upon the paranoia of 1950s McCarthyism
(or more recent vested anxieties, for that matter), THE
IRON GIANT is a stunning piece of myth & folklore. At once
fast and loose while cunningly methodical, Bird's film is
both gleefully whimsical and chillingly serious. As a tale
for all ages, THE IRON GIANT is irresistible.

Ponder its precious moments with a deer in the forest, or
its many pointed observations on the fragile nature of
Trust and Responsibility, and you have a tale for the ages;
perhaps best told by a candle's glow, or the flicker of a
flashlight.

The Special Edition DVD is the best way to obtain this
film. Bearing the commentary of Bird and many of his
associates, the film has many informative extras which
greatly enhances one's appreciation for the enormous
task successfully accomplished by director, cast, and
crew. One of my favorite points of the DVD's mini-
documentaries is the interview spots with composer
Michael Kamen, whose soaring score for THE IRON GIANT
is a landmark in film music.

All in all, here is a feature which symbolizes the

1252306,5,B000028U3R,"The Iron Giant is a loose adaptation of a wonderful book of the same title, by Ted Hughes (written in the late sixties).  In the book the origins of the giant are unknown, and he is initially buried beneath the earth before being attacked and ultimately befriended.  The enemy in the book, who becomes a common enemy to both the humans and the giant and the cause of their alliance, was a giant dragon-like creature (as big as Australia!!) who the giant ends up outsmarting.

In the film, set during the Cold War, and presenting a wonderful portrait of the 50s atmosphere, the enemy is US -- and our tendency to fear what is alien, and to shoot first and ask questions later.  I think that this is, in the end, more profound.  Of course, the original author may have had some such allegory in mind when he wrote the original book, since the dragon from outer space ends up destroying and enveloping in darkness a large part of the planet, almost like a world war.  But in that case is their alliance with the giant supposed to mean an alliance with military technology in order to prevent a world war?  In the film, the robot is just a cool robot from outer space, that human beings can choose to make a friend or to establish as an enemy.

In any case, this is easily one of the best animated films to come out of the United States in the last decade (and one of the others is by the same director, Brad Bird).",1125360000,3,1411,4.318181818181818

Then there are movies like The Iron Giant; movies that slip under the radar and are pure diamonds in the ruff. This is a family movie that can be enjoyed by adults and children.

The plot takes place in the 1950's during the height of the cold war when everyone is paranoid over nuclear attacks.

Hogarth is an imaginative little boy being raised by his single mother. Left home alone while his mother works a late shift at her waitress job, Hogarth ventures off into the woods near his house and discovers and saves the life of the Iron Giant. The Iron Giant crash landed on earth from his war ridden planet. Hogarth develops a friendship with the metal giant but soon realizes he has a dangerous side. The Iron Giant reacts (in a big way) defensively against attacks. So in other words, if he feels threatened, he goes into a sort of auto pilot mode and will attack the threat no matter whom or what that threat is. The giant realizes that it almost attacked his best friend and promises to be like Super man; good and non violent.

Naturally, it becomes rather difficult to conceal this large giant and a nosy government agent becomes suspicious thusly starts investigating the strange happenings that surrounds the giant. I don't want to tell too much about the plot because it's really a movie that you should see yourself. But it has such a beautiful message at the end. The animation is just superbly done. The emotion is captured so well in the characters and I love the 1950's feel.

You will not be disappointed in this movie regardless of your age.",1124236800,2,1860,4.526785714285714
1252308,5,B000028U3R,"My 7 year old son and I both LOVE this movie.  We first saw it on TV when he was 6 and neither of us could take our eyes off of it, so I had to buy it.  It is such a great movie on so many levels.  It teaches - friendship, self-sacrifice, the fact that you can ""choose who you want to be"", and so much more, but it does it without seeming too sappy or predictable.  It's got adventure, excitement, love, and even some cool weapons on the robot that don't seem too scary and the robot doesn't even want to use them, he only uses them in defense.  I would say that boys will enjoy this movie more than girls, it is about a boy and a robot after all, but girls might like it too.  This is a must have for any little boy over 3 or 4, and their moms!  Plus, the ending is GREAT, but you must make sure you watch till the very end!",1123891200,,825,3.789473684210526

1252310,5,B000028U3R,"This film, based on a children's novella by the late Ted Hughes, is a beautifully rendered, thoughtfully written, carefully assembled cinematic gem.  'The Iron Giant' evokes the pop-culture bubbly effervescence of the 1950's, along with that era's nuclear paranoia.

Hogarth Hughes is an imaginative pre-teen who apparently constantly finds forest creatures of all manners and brings them home to keep as pets, much to the chagrin of his single mother.  He befriends Dean, a beatnik with a big heart, who lives in and runs the local junkyard.  One night while home alone, Hogarth investigates the disappearance of his TV signal and finds a giant robot, whose glowing green eyes seem to indicate life inside.  Hogarth manages to keep the robot a secret for a while, teaching the creature to mimic human speech and dive into ponds, among other things.  Eventually, the odd happenings surrounding the giant prompt a government agent to investigate, causing the giant to be outed.

In the end, thanks to some great voice acting by Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., and Vin Diesel (nearly unrecognizable as the giant), along with some very wonderful production design and masterful direction by Brad Bird, this film brings a marvelous message with it.  If you see it, I hope you choose to listen. Final Grade: A",1122508800,2,1310,5.06046511627907

1252313,5,B000028U3R,"""The Iron Giant"" was Brad Bird's debut animated feature, several years before he created ""The Incredibles"" (which happens to be the best animated movie I've ever seen). I'd not heard of this movie or the original story, a children's novel by the late and renowned British poet Ted Hughes. Bird, however, is one of the very few animators who can write and tell a story with a genuine human touch.
  Set in a wryly named Downeast Maine hamlet called Rockwell,
this is an unusual mix- part boy-and-pet fable, part '50s-style sci-fi/Cold War thriller with some gentle humor added. The main character, a friendly red-haired boy named Hogarth Hughes, is not only raised by a single mom (the waitress at the town diner)
but the kid who finds a mysterious 50-foot robot in the woods...
and helps him become not a man-eating monster, but a ""friendly giant"". He also keeps the secret from not only the townies, but a glib FBI agent who happens to rent a room in his house.
  A well-done mix of old-fashioned hand-drawn designs (with
good '50s decor) and the computer-driven Giant make for a nice transition between the classic Disney-style look and the flashy CGI era. Sequences involving the Giant, who can put himself together in seconds, are just geeky enough- this is a human-scale
movie, not a high-tech extravaganza. The character mix is also interesting and not typical '50s white-bread, especially the laid-back, beatnik-style scrap yard owner, Dean McCubbin (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.)
  Connick is the biggest name among the voice cast, which includes a down-to-earth Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's waitress mom, a caffeinated Christopher McDonald as the true-believer FBI man Mansley, and even the salty M. Emmet Walsh as the old salt who stumbles upon the seaborne Giant. But the best voice work belongs to an impressive child actor from San Francisco, Eli Marienthal, who gives Hogarth his warm, empathetic quality and personality that's rare in a cartoon kid (or a live-action one).
Don't forget Vin Diesel's perfect mechanical grunts as Hogarth teaches the Giant to talk!
  Even the music and sound effects are subtle, rather than splashy. Michael Kamen's moody, symphonic score is unusual- and classy- for animation, and a few well-chosen rock n'roll oldies (notably ""Searchin'"" by the Coasters) are added, yet neither overwhelms. This is a story, not a ""Shrek""-style pastiche, and it shows.
  ""The Iron Giant"" isn't just a sci-fi tribute, but a thoughtful fable with a central theme of friendship and self-
guidance. Its surprising, and touching, finale, like the entire movie, is life-affirming without ever getting gooey or preachy.
  I can see why this movie slipped through the cracks on release. Studio politics is one thing, but the nature of ""The Iron Giant""- not quite fantasy, not quite high-tech- is hard to peg. What it is, though, is one of the nicest family-friendly movies I've seen in a while. I saw the older DVD version, but if the great success of ""The Incredibles"" gets others, like me, to check out Bird's other work, they'll discover a story that's not easy to pull off, animated or live. ""The Iron Giant"" deserves its
reputation as a lost animated gem!
  UPDATE: I recently checked this movie out for the first time in a year and, once again, think it's terrific. One of the few American animated movies with real depth and meaning- and a crackling good tribute to, not to mention send-up of, Cold War/
sci-fi thrillers. Some surprise gags, too, like the sequence where Hogarth and agent Mansley share ice cream- and Hogarth puts Ex-Lax on the agent's sundae! What a wicked bit of humor there. The extras are great, too: when you watch the ""Behind the Armor"" version, little interviews pop up that really enhance, not detract from, the story line. Those with the late Michael Kamen, who wrote and conducted the score (in the Czech Republic, oddly enough) are especially interesting. The most unusual fact about ""Iron Giant"" is that the Ted Hughes story was originally optioned by Pete Townshend to develop into a ""Tommy""-style rock opera, but Townshend's friend, director Des McAnuff, insisted it would work better as an animated feature and brought it to an ambitious young ""Simpsons"" associate named Brad Bird. If Brad had never made ""The Incredibles"", he'd be remembered as one of the all-time great animation talents for ""Iron Giant"" alone. Again, I can't recommend this marvelous movie enough.",1111536000,10,4428,4.990502035278155
1252314,4,B000028U3R,"Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in the genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.

The story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.

The day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital ""actor"" as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the ""duck and cover"" instructional in school every year of his short life.

If joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. ""Voiced"" by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.

Along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.

Technically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).

1252321,5,B000028U3R,"I've been waiting for this one.  The film that vanished from theaters in 1999 faster than you could say ""best reviews of the year"" has finally been granted special edition status.  Sort of.  It's apparently been available in other countries for years, and not much has been added since.  On the other hand, it's quite a coincidence that the release coincided with the appearance of his latest project, the also well-reviewed 'Incredibles.'  But enough grousing.  Everyone knows that it's a great film, but how does the new deluxe version hold up?

Not so well, I have to admit.  The commentary is the only truly noteworthy aspect of this release, and it stars Brad Bird as well as three other people heavily involved in the project.  That should make fans happy, and it's long overdue (the story of Warner's unwillingness to fund the project from day one is well-known).  Sadly, the other features are fairly mediocre and uninformative.  The hidden-in-plain-sight Easter Eggs involve about 45 seconds of material, the deleted scenes are a pastiche of storyboard material given an animated halflife (fair enough, given the medium, I suppose), and just generally feels tacked on (Quote alert!).

The print and audio quality are good, however, so that shouldn't be a concern.  And like I said, it's a brilliant film that-- given the current state of US affairs-- is as timely as timeless.  And its initial price is lower than the original DVD release!  Looks like Warner Brothers is still committed to pinching pennies with this one, but The Iron Giant is a movie that will only gain status with the passage of time, and it's dynamite viewing for children and adults.

Wonderful animation seamlessly blending hand-drawn and computer-generated artwork, a talented vocal cast and a great story revolving around Cold War fears combine to make an exceptional family film.

Contrary to some of the other reviews, the language is non-explicit and not inappropriate for an older child. The movie as a whole isn't aimed for the toddler set anyway. There are a few images that younger children might find upsetting, and there is some violence towards the end of the film when the Giant is provoked by the military. And unlike the obviously pro-NRA review posted elsewhere, I don't feel this movie is anti-gun as much as anti-violence in general, and shows that there are alternatives to violence.

But now this has pride & place in my favourite movies - alongside Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Miss Congeniality, Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, and there's probably more.

I hardly watch animation anymore, unless its Simpsons or Family Guy, and I've never been that keen on Japanese animation particularly, and for some reason got this into my head as being Japanese animated. But it wasn't. (I hate the unrealistic HUGE eyes) I simply forgot after a while that this was just drawings or CGI. It's not one of those animations, where the words don't match the movements of the mouth etc.

And I loved the fact that some famous people were instantly recognisable just by the voices. I practically cheered when I recognised Jennifer Aniston's voice straight away, and although I've never heard Harry Connick Jnr speak (only sing), I wasn't sure about his voice, but his character looked really similar to him! Vin Diesel was a little harder to guess, as he was the voice of the giant, and his voice sounded overly processed, but obviously, it's not going to sound normal!

The difference between this movie, and any Disney movies, is the lack of songs. It's not as schmaltzy as a Disney movie, and it definitely makes it better. There's a fantastic score by Michael Kamen, and the good thing is there a definite lack of songs, which you might normally find. And Brad Bird has now joined Pixar and recently made the Incredibles movie.

It's has a lot of incredible laugh out loud moments, and scenes that you need to watch over & over. I particularly had to re-watch the scrapyard scene where the giant takes a bite out of a car and its alarm starts going off! The look on his face was unforgettable, and then he tries sitting on it, and then he starts smashing it to shut it up! It's so funny, I'm sitting at the computer trying to not to make it obvious I'm giggling at the memory. The other scene which had me creasing myself, and had me crying with laughter, was the lake scene, where the giant follows the little boy into the lake. BONZAI!!! The following scene is hilarious, where you see a racoon desperately trying to swim, or Dean ending up in the middle of the road, soaking wet.

The entire story seldom gets boring or slow, which I sometimes tend to find with animation, or any movie for that matter. It's quite short at the same time, only 86 minutes. I didn't like the FBI guy or whatever he was. He was drawn evil, and he was definitely not a good thing. But then he wasn't meant to be.

I don't remember much about this movie when it originally came out, which is 5 years ago, but apparently, Warner didn't do a great job of advertising it, so it probably sank without a trace, and only got to where it is by word of mouth.

It has bits of ET in it, but the sentimental, tear-inducing finale reminded me SOOOOOO much of the finale to Armageddon. Which was a neat touch I thought. I did get quite teary, although not full on bawling. I got choked up by the end.

I'm so glad that I was recommended to watch this movie, and would definitely rewatch it at some point, although you'll have to stop me trying to watch the funny moments over & over.

1252328,5,B000028U3R,"When The Iron Giant was released in 1999, it flew in the face of the current trend popularized by Disney animated musicals. Based on the 1968 children's book, The Giant: A Story in Five Nights, by late British poet Ted Hughes, The Iron Giant refuses to rely on musical numbers and simplify its message in an obvious appeal to kids. It is one of those rare animated films that both adults and kids can appreciate. It is also a nostalgic ode to the '50s that is thought-provoking and entertaining.

There are brief biographies and filmographies for the cast and crew.

Also included is an audio commentary by director Brad Bird, head of animation Tony Fucile, story development head Jeff Lynch and animation supervisor Steven Markowski. They talk about the challenges of realizing their ambitious ideas with a limited budget and time constraints. This is a very informative, if slightly technical track.

There are eight additional scenes with introductions by Bird that total 18 minutes. This includes an original opening sequence that was longer and too elaborate.

""Teddy Newton `The X-Factor'"" is a five-minute look at storyboard artist, Newton. He's a creative guy who drew up boards for the movie and talks over some of his drawings, including scene that featured a date between Dean and Hogarth's mom in Canada.

""Duck and Cover Sequence"" features Newton again as he talks about the creation of the old educational film that Hogarth and his class watch.

""The Voice of the Giant"" features footage from the original featurette on the first DVD version of this movie. It briefly examines Vin Diesel's work on The Iron Giant.

""Behind the Armor"" allows you to watch the movie and at certain points access behind-the-scenes footage for a particular scene.

""Motion Gallery"" is a four-minute reel of rough drawings, artwork and storyboards juxtaposed with the finished film.

Finally, there are two trailers for the movie.

Missing in action from the first DVD is the music video for ""Cha-Hua-Hua"" by Eddie Platt and the 22-minute Making Of featurette (some of it has been absorbed into the new extras) but they aren't really missed with all of these new, more substantial extras.

The Iron Giant is one of those rare animated films that not only appeals to both children and adults; it does not contain one annoying musical number. It is also refuses to serve as one long, obvious advertisement for a toy. In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching story about tolerance and compassion. It deals with real issues like death and bigotry-pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film-in an honest and heartfelt way.

Take your original DVD release copy and give it to someone who might not otherwise look at anything like this or just keep it as a ""spare"" - but buy this one... it's all we deserved all along.

1252330,5,B000028U3R,"I am always hesitant to give a five-star rating to a film.  I always try to compare movies to ones that are in the same genre first, and then to films that have stood the test of time before determining if they are worthy of five stars.  ""The Iron Giant"" towers over the competition in its genre, and I believe that it will be around much longer than many of its modern counterparts.  It is full of heart, wonder, and amazement.  It has emotional twists that keep you intrigued.  It is definitely worthy of five stars.

First of all, the giant is great.  He's just a big kid trying to find his place in the universe.  ""E.T."" entered my mind as soon as he is discovered by young Hogarth near the power plant.  There is a charm about the giant that I have seen in few Disney or Dreamworks characters.  You will deeply care about him before the film is over.

Hogarth is the typical little boy.  He loves sci-fi and horror movies, even though his mother doesn't quite approve of them.  He likes to sneak out of the house every once in awhile for a little mischief.  When he hears noises, they automatically become ""invaders from Mars.""  He is such a wonderful little character to watch on the screen.

The voices in the film are brilliantly cast.  Vin Diesel voices the giant.  He manages to evoke tons of emotion, even though most of his lines have fewer than three words in them.  Harry Connick, Jr. stands out as Dean, the local scrap metal artist, who helps Hogarth ""hide"" the giant.  Jennifer Aniston plays Hogarth's mother, who busts her bottom to support her son.  There is a genuine love between her character and that of Hogarth's that is missing in most animated features today.  Chrisopher McDonald plays a scheming government agent and John Mahoney lends his voice to the general who doesn't believe McDonald at first, but is then fooled into listening to him.  Eli Marienthal portrays Hogarth.  Considering that he plays Stifler's brother in the ""American Pie"" films, he does an amazing job in capturing the wonder inside of Hogarth.  M. Emmett Walsh and Cloris Leachman are two of the other stellar voices in this feature.  There roles aren't as big, but they are great in the movie.

The animation is beautiful.  From the forest and countryside to the little town that is ""terrorized"" by the giant, it's all brilliantly done.

The story is one full of emotion.  I'll be honest and tell you that I shed a few tears near the end of the movie.  The characters are so likeable and the story is so good that it is hard not to get caught up in the moment.

As far as the DVD is concerned, there are more special features than you'd expect for a film such as this.  It didn't do extremely well at the box office, so I wasn't expecting much in the way of extras.  What you get are deleted scenes from the movie, interviews with members of the crew, hidden gems that you have to bounce around the menu for, and mini-documentaries on the creation of the film.

There are a couple of curse words in the movie, but the story is so great that you can look beyond this.  Naturally, anything involving a giant includes a little violence, but it is all handled with care.  There is one sad moment involving a deer, and some may consider the message a little preachy, but just keep in mind that our hero and his young friend are both children trying to cope with reality.

Trust me when I say that you will fall in love with this movie.  It has a powerful story and never gets too sugary for anyone.  It will hold the attention of all viewers, no matter what their age.  It is worthy of multiple views and definitely worth purchasing.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  Watch it with your family after you have a home-cooked meal at the dinner table to top off a perfect evening.",1101772800,3,3795,4.454941860465116
1252331,5,B000028U3R,Brad Bird must be a genious.  I was so happy to find this movie on DVD 6 months ago at Circuit City despite the fact that it should have been pulled off the shelves because it was discontinued for the re-release that coincide with the Incredibles.  The Iron Giant is just a really feel good movie with real values that don't get instilled in any of those lame Disney cartoons about murder and death in the family.  This is a happy movie that everyone should watch because it's truly enjoyable and suitable for everyone.  Plus Vin Diesel really does sound like a robot!,1101168000,2,568,4.485436893203883
1252332,5,B000028U3R,"Like the Iron Giant, we're all prreprogrammed to varying extents -- but we don't have to accept the programming any more than the big fella in this splendid animated feature. From Hogarth, a spunky young boy, the Iron Giant learns ""You are who you choose to be."" That is powerful, powerful knowledge for the Iron Giant, as it is for everyone. That message is what makes the movie a true ""must see"" for all ages.

Since childhood, we're all programmed from our environments and our experiences. We behave in certain ways and think in certain ways because we've accepted the subliminal programming going on around us from parents, peers, society, news media, advertising, etc. And sometimes we become programmed as weapons, as is the Iron Giant, using wounding words or actions aimed at others because we've accepted programming to do so.

The Iron Giant's story reminds all of us that programming can be changed. We can choose to think differently. We don't have to act and react in the same old ways, like our parents or friends do. ""You are who you choose to be"" is an empowering statement of personal freedom to be the best we were meant to be.

Is it easy to choose to change? No, not always. No, not usually. The Iron Giant certainly encounters difficulties, from the fear-based military and towns people, as he changes his programming. But with the will to do so, it can be done.

Friends can help us see our true selves and potentials. At his metallic heart, the Iron Giant is a gentle, sensitive creature, and when Hogarth extends the hand of friendship, the Iron Giant truly blossoms. Hogarth's faith in the Iron Giant helps the metal man have faith in himself and helps him hold the image of himself as a ""good guy"" and not a programmed ""gun."" The Iron Giant and Hogarth are tremendous role models for self-empowerment. I wish every person would see this movie and absorb its message.",1100736000,2,1893,4.692771084337349
1252333,5,B000028U3R,"Could be, and the special edition is superb.  The picture itself, in widescreen and a new digital transfer, looks better than I have ever seen it on previous releases or television showings.

And special features? Did you ask me about special features?  The commentary by director/co-writer Brad Bird & his crew points out, among many other things, where you can have some fun watching the movie in slow-motion.  There are several deleted scenes, in various stages of animation depending on how far along they were in the process when they were cut. Most of these are interesting alternatives to the film as shown, but you can see why they were ""left on the floor.""  But one or two are fascinatining glimpses into the history and backstory of the characters, and one wishes they could have found room in the film. Most especially ""The Giant's Dream""--plus, that one just looks like it could have been so cool.

In at least one way this DVD is even superior to the Lord of the Rings releases, in that they found a way to make a picture gallery interesting: A fully-scored montage of animation art, pencil tests and finished scenes, sure to bring a smile to the face of any animation fan.

There's also a couple of neat sequences that didn't make the film in whole or in part, as hatched from the apparently demented brain of creative consultant Teddy Newton. These may not have fit with the tone of this film, but I'm sure glad they got a showcase here.  Newton really ought to be writing and drawing children's books; his segments have an inspired, antic silliness.

The ""mini-documentaries"" are as lovely as anything else on the disc. I especially liked hearing from composer Michael Kamen, now sadly deceased.

Kamen scored Brazil, the Die Hard movies, Mr. Holland's Opus, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (with lyrics by Eric Idle) and the Lethal Weapon movies (with Clapton & Sanborn).  It's enriching to hear him talk a little about how he approached a score.",1100649600,19,1966,4.769911504424779
1252334,5,B000028U3R,"Director Brad Bird (The Simpsons & The Incredibles) surpasses some of Disney's finest with the highly entertaining animated adventure ""The Iron Giant"". In the dawn of the Cold War, a spirited New England boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) forms a strong friendship with a gigantic metal-eating robot (Vin Diesel) from another world. When an ambitious government agent (Christopher MacDonald) arrives to investigate strange events in town, Hogarth and the local beatnik (Harry Connick Jr.) must protect their enormous visitor from the US military. Based on the 1968 children's book, ""The Iron Giant"" is a superbly enjoyable animated treasure. Though the animated movie failed in theaters, it received great critical praise and a good cult following upon home video release and television airings. The underrated family film contains a well written story, memorable characters, great humor and a strong morale message. The talented voice cast also includes John Mahoney (Frasier) and Jennifer Aniston (Freinds).

""The Iron Giant"" Special Edition is a notable improvement over its previous release. The 1999 animated feature is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a wonderful video transfer with rich detailed colors, and a lively Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Among special features, it includes a comprehensive audio commentary with director Brad Bird and production crew, several deleted scenes, a picture gallery, theatrical trailers, appealing interactive menus and entertaining behind-the-scenes featurettes.

Hopefully the popularity of ""The Incredibles"" and this new release of ""The Iron Giant"" will draw additional exposure to this underrated film, because this is probably the best traditionally-animated film released since ""The Lion King"" (and will surpass it in the eyes of some). It is well-written, well-animated, well-voiced, and well-directed. It manages to be funny, dramatic, tender, action-packed, AND original in one tidily wrapped package.

There's everything I love in a movie - laughs, a few tears and a story that has a point.  It's set in 1957 and deals ostensibly with cold-war politics and fear of that nuclear bomb attack that was coming any day from The USSR (the ""duck and cover"" movie that Hogarth's class had to watch brought back memories!)but it also says a lot about the awful tendancy we have to judge anything ""different"" as bad, dangerous and only worthy of destruction.  I recommend this movie to adults - maybe more than children.  It reminds us of a lesson we forget too easily - especilly these days - in a very enjoyable way.",1099958400,3,879,4.361963190184049

1252342,5,B000028U3R,"The irony about this film is that the reason it is so well done, is a result of it not getting adequate advertising and promotion when it was released.

The horrible film ""Quest for Camelot,"" was Warner's previous animated film, and it performed poorly at the box office.  They decided to shut down their feature animation department after The Iron Giant.  As such, none of the executives and ""suits"" at Warner concerned themselves with the Iron Giant.  They let Brad Bird complete his vision without the typical interference of an animation studio production, but they also did not set up any real promotion for the film.

By the time Warner Brothers realized what a gem they had, it was too late to advertise it properly, and it failed at the box office.

This film is one of my top 3 films of all time, and not just animated films.  It has emotion, heart, drama, tension and wonderful characters along with tremendous animation.

This is also one of the best examples of 3d computer animation being integrated with 2d cel animation.  The main character -- the Giant -- is a 3d computer animated character as in PIXAR's films, but everything and everyone else in the film is a 2d drawing like Disney animation.

1252346,5,B000028U3R,"I believe that decades from now when film school students study the history of American animation, the Iron Giant will be seen as perhaps the last great example of traditionally hand-drawn animated movies, before the switch to computer animation a la Finding Nemo.

The saddest thing about this movie is that when it was originally released in theaters, its promotion was so under-funded and just plain bad, that it wasn't very successful. Thankfully, it has gotten a devoted following on VHS and DVD.

This movie is an example of what animated movies routinely accomplish in Japan, but rarely do here in the U.S. It's well written, visually impressive, and works for all ages, not just children.

Be warned that it may not be suitable for very young children.  The climactic battle sequence features a potentially scary transformation of the Iron Giant. Don't get me wrong, this movie is suitable for all but the youngest viewers and *most* very young kids can probably deal with it just fine. But some kids are more sensitive and nightmare-prone than others, so if you have kids under the age of 6, I suggest you preview the movie before allowing them to watch it.

Some movies are best rented, others are best purchased. This is in the latter category: it's a keeper! If you're an adult that has written off animated movies as ""kid's stuff"" because they tend to be trite and formulaic, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.

So many reviewers are so easily pleased that they appear incapable of giving less than 5 stars, which is a shame, because this is a movie that deserves to stand out from the crowd, and absolutely earned its 5 star rating.",1092528000,10,1653,4.722222222222222

The story is about Hogarth Hughes, a 12 year old boy, who is a nerd at school. He doesn't have any friends, and likes to daydream and imagine. When the ""iron giant"" crash lands on earth, and Hogarth saves him from being destroyed, they soon become great friends.

1252350,5,B000028U3R,"The Iron Giant is one of those movies that comes along and reminds how good of a storytelling format traditional animation can be.  Instead of getting a standard Disney formula (Male and Female lead characters, with animal sidekick, with a politically correct message) we get a film that pays homage to 1950s B-movies, a McCarthyite villain, and a tale of a boy and his friend trying to learn from each other what it really means to be friends and to have a soul.  I can't recall any Disney film that it treated it characters as having as much and complexity as the ones in this film.  And instead of trying to beat the viewer over the head with its message, this film allows events to occur and it is the story that gets the message across, not some patronizing dialogue.
In addition, we get the pleasure of an uncredited Vin Diesel role as the voice of the Iron Giant.

1252355,5,B000028U3R,"When most people think of animated movies they usually think one of two things---kiddy fodder or Disney. Rarely does an animated movie appeal to anything but children, and rarely does any other studio besides Disney put out anything worth viewing. Even Disney cannot seem to master their patented, one-dimensional creations any longer, leaving them nearly lifeless at the mercy of Pixar. So, who would have thought that a little movie titled ""The Iron Giant"" from Warner Bros. could trump them both? Beats the heck outta me...yet, somehow it makes sense.
The age of the old Disney ""magic"" seems to be almost completely dead---murdered by the increasing number of pop culture references, dirty jokes, and sarcastic comments that are becoming a staple, if not a MUST, for animated features today. And even though Pixar has mastered that aforementioned art so well that adults are often more attracted to their movies than children, there still is something missing. You can add all the humor and CGI effects in the world, but you can't fabricate heart.
""The Iron Giant"" isn't what it appears to be. From a distance, it looks like your run-of-the-mill cartoon---boy finds giant, giant turns out to be good, giant is misunderstood by everyone but boy, problem resolved in climatic hero sequence, everyone lives happily ever after---little substance, right? Wrong. It's way more than a cutesy corn-fest; ""The Iron Giant"" actually delves right into some of the biggest problems of our society.
Set in the 1950's, after WWII, when the air reeked with cold war sentiments, ""The Iron Giant"" manages to deal with the preposterous goings-on of entire decades worth of history during the 87 minutes of this clever and engaging film. The whole story is centered upon the ignorant ""shoot first, ask questions later"" belief system that was unbelievably prevalent during the cold war. Not only that, but the movie pinpoints the mentality in which the use of guns is a panacea to ""protect"" human existence, when in all actuality, they only destroy it before it can even begin.
It is quite possible that kids might not read as much into this movie, though...unless they have an unprecedented knowledge of the time period or society, in general. That's why it is incredible. It satisfies all ages but in an intelligent, classy manner. Kids will view ""The Iron Giant"" and become completely transfixed by the giant iron dude on the screen, while adults can pick up on subtle humor and meaningful subtext as they too are enamored by the characters. Also, the adult characters act and speak (not limiting themselves to G-rated language) like real people...but don't expect the vulgar innuendos of some other ""kid-friendly"" blockbusters. The dialogue here is actually appropriate in context, so instead of just throwing in some cursing for ""cool factor"", this movie's realism is strengthened by it.
I have never seen a better acted (or scripted) animated movie. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, is instantly loveable for his wide-eyed enthusiasm, impish charm, and quick wit. Hogarth's mother (Jennifer Aniston) is an amazing addition to the movie because she offers a dose of reality that stereotypical cartoon moms do not have---a single mom trying to maintain her son and home by working a dead-end job at a diner. Then there's Dean (Harry Connick Jr.), the resident cool, free-thinking hipster, who befriends Hogarth and gives him and the giant a safe haven while becoming more and more of a father figure throughout the movie. And of course there's Giant, who is about as impossible to like as a super-sized puppy...well, except when he snaps...
Even the villain in this movie is likeable (because great villains should be). Kent Mansley (Christopher MacDonald), the intruding government agent, is so hilarious in an understated way in almost every scene; it's hard not to like him a little. Calling Hogarth everything from ""Champ"" to ""Slugger"" in attempt to him win over into confessing his knowledge of the giant, Kent Mansley is the epitome of a charming, yet calculating numbskull.
""The Iron Giant"" may not side-splitting, it may not be a tried-and-true cartoon love story, and it may not be an extravagant tale of adventure and magic...but jokes grow old, sugar-coated love creates cavities, and long journeys are tiresome. What the ""Giant"" has is genuine, real, and is worth more than a thousand cookie-cutter laughs.
P.S. The army general, (John Mahoney), is a great supporting character. His interactions with Mansley are not to be overlooked---""Where's the giant, Mansley?!""",1084924800,2,4556,5.116778523489933

It's very very sad Warner Bros has been beaten by Disney, who are cheap and only do CGI movies now. I prefer to see hand-drawn work! The Iron Giant does have some CGI but you can't barely notice it and that's as far as I'll go with CGI animated movies. And Warner Bros has stuck to the old fashion never lets you down pencil and paper. And for this I love them entirely! This movie didn't make a lot of money or get a lot of hype because Disney and their cheap CGI movie Toy Story 2(which doesn't hold a flame to The Iron Giant). And speaking of Disney overshadowing the GREAT Warner Bros, they also did this when Warner Bros released in theatres ""Cats Don't Dance""(Another AWESOME movie!)and Disney released the very stupid and all wrong Hercules!(Did they even read about Hercules!? It looks like they just read about 2 things on him and made up the rest of the story which by the way was really lame!) My whole family LOVES this movie. It does have some adult humor but not a lot nor do they take it too far that is no longer is appropriate for kids or the movie itself. This movie makes you cry(unless you have absolutley no feelings!), laugh, smile, and look in awe. This is a classic and always will be, something Finding Nemo, Bugs Life, and Toy Story will not be! It deserves more than 5 stars, it deserves a million!",1075507200,,1424,4.377358490566038
1252358,5,B000028U3R,"When I saw the trailer for this film I immediately thought ""Kid's Movie.""  While there is plenty here for them, there is also an abundance of witty dialogue and comic situations that adults should love as well.  My one and only complaint comes from an early moment in the film when  the Iron Giant gets tangled in a mess of electrical wires, the current still surging through them.  Hogarth saves the robot, thus making a friend of him, by pulling down on a huge ""on/off"" switch at the town's power station.  I could not imagine how many vandals and delinquents would love to see that kind of switch, with the words ""on"" and ""off"" clearly printed in large colored letters, in the middle of a heavily wooded area with maximum concealment.  That plot discrepency laid aside, the rest of the film flows without flaw, and it pains me to point out the one and only part which just didn't make any sense.  I do realize this is a story about a giant robot from outer space, so I will let it slide (note the 5-star-rating).  The mixture of classic-style animation and computer animation melds surprisingly well, and is both inventive and extraordinary.  I was reluctant to rent this movie when it hit the video store shelves but now I own it.  This film is great for both kids and kids-at-heart.  A great story with a marvelous ending.",1073347200,2,1327,4.556962025316456

1252361,5,B000028U3R,"1999's The Iron Giant is one of those truly outstanding films that never got the attention it deserved at the time of its theatrical release.  While it may not have the glitzy look and feel of a Disney film, this Warner Brothers animated movie is of the highest caliber.  The Iron Giant has a heart and a natural home-spun appeal that make it a great film for children as well as adults.  Disney animated films always have a distinctly Disney aura to them, but The Iron Giant disavows artificiality to the extent that it almost seems too natural to be a movie.  The animation is solid and impressive without any over-the-top or flashy sequences, the voice acting (featuring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Christopher McDonald, Eli Marienthal, and Vin Diesel) is quite good, and the story is both entertaining and heart-warming, imparting some important lessons about life without ever becoming the least bit preachy.
It is 1957, and the Soviets have just launched Sputnik, giving rise to a sense of concern to the American people and its government.  Thus, when something foreign tears through the atmosphere and hits the water some few miles off the coast of Maine, the government wants to know what this mysterious object is.  Before government agent Kent Mansley arrives to investigate, though, young Hogarth Hughes has made first contact with what turns out to be a huge metal robot.  The giant is child-like in terms of adapting to life on earth and does not seem to remember where it originally came from, but the lad soon makes friends with him and teaches him many of the things a parent would teach his own child.  The giant gets a poignant and sad bird's-eye view of death, reinforcing its seemingly innate hatred of guns, and has little trouble developing a moral philosophy of goodness, choosing to mimic Superman rather than the evil robot Atomo.  As sometimes happens in this world, though, the giant's goodness is met with fright, paranoia, and panic on the part of society, and Hogarth is only able to hide his gigantic new friend from the world for so long.  The initially somewhat goofy but ultimately detestable agent Mansley sees to it that the army does everything in its power to destroy the gentle giant.  He fears the giant simply because it is alien and different, never making the first attempt to understand or communicate with it.  As might be expected, the giant eventually has to prove himself in a way that will convince even those who fear him of his kind and generous soul.  In essence, the giant becomes the most human character in the film.
I have to say that there are a couple of pretty sad scenes in the film, but the hard lessons of life are presented in such a way as to be more empowering than frightening to the most sensitive of viewers.  By and large, the movie is humorous on a number of levels, exuding obvious appeal to young and old alike.  To sum up, The Iron Giant is nothing less than superb family entertainment in the widest sense of the term.",1062806400,,3017,4.698292220113852

This movie perfectly captures the atmosphere of the 50's - if you liked ""Tin Men"" for the depiction of the times, you MUST see this...  Great fun, and something rare these days - A ""kids"" movie, which adults will want to watch more than once...",1061251200,,508,4.451612903225806
1252363,5,B000028U3R,"Despite glowing praise from the critics and enthusiastic responses from audiences, ""The Iron Giant"" crept in and out of theatres with barely a whisper. And what a terrible shame it was. It seems to me that so often the very best of children's programming (other movies that come to mind are ""The Secret Garden"", ""A Little Princess"" and ""Fairytale: A True Story"") that can be just as easily enjoyed by their parents are unfairly shadowed by the empty and junky movies put in the spotlight by huge advertising and wide range of merchandising.
It is the Cold War, and young Hogarth living in the Maine woods is, like everyone else, on edge about what other countries are getting up to behind America's back. Of course, as a kid, such worries are easily prepared for with sauce-pan helmets and plastic guns. When the antennae from his roof is mysterious torn off, young Hogarth comes to the obvious conclusion (""Invaders from Mars!"") and makes his way into the woods to find the culprit. Which is, believe it or not, a huge iron robot that has no idea how it got there.
Delighted at his find, Hogarth instantly adopts him, and coaxes him homeward to hide in the barn, away from the eyes (and inevitable screams) of his single mother Annie, and introducing him to the concept of good and evil, souls, death, fear of the unknown and Superman. But other forces are on the move - the paranoid governent is on the lookout for any odd disturbances which could mean spying foreign countries, and one agent in particular is determined to track down the Giant.
Helped by his beatnik friend Dean who creates art at the local junkyard, Hogarth pits his skills against this agent, who wonderfully captures every shade of prejudice humankind can show - from subterfuge to threats to madness. Everyone loves watching ""helpless"" kids being pitted up against ""older, wiser"" adults, and in this case the conflict doesn't disappoint - I defy anyone not to burst out laughing at the results of a certain powder Hogarth pours into the agent's milkshake.
The final message ""You are what you choose to be"" is beautifully worked up to when the Giant realises that he reacts defensively to any attack upon him, and when the military is called in, he is devastated at the thought of being merely a gun. The climax is something I can't give away, but it is a beautiful ending to a powerful story.
Animation is not in any way stylised or overly cartoonish, and the humans look, move and sound like natural humans. Voice acting is good on all fronts, from the adequate Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr as Annie and Dean, to the then-unknown Vin Diesiel as the Giant, before his fame took hold after ""Pitch Black"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"". But special mention must be made of Christopher McDonald as the high-strung agent, and the voice actor (sorry, I don't know exactly who it is) of Hogarth, who brings his character to life with all its energy, egoism, sincerity and innocence that all ten year old boys have - look out especially for the scene in which he drinks a little too much coffee! With no broadway-style musical numbers or corny endings, ""The Iron Giant"" is serious, poignant and sweet, without being too sentimental.
In the course of this movie young Hogarth tells the Iron Giant: ""You think about important things. And you care about things. That must mean you have a soul."" The same thing could be said of this movie, and indeed compared with some of the other rubbish that is catapulted rapidly into children's minds these days, the rare movie/book that touches on such real issues as ""The Iron Giant"" does *do* seem to have souls.",1059868800,,3626,4.6938775510204085

1252366,5,B000028U3R,"This is an amazing film. One of the best animated films ever. Disney wishes it had stories like this to work with. Fortunately there will be more from Brad Bird and Pixar in the near future. The story is about self-determination and the will to take the power of anger and see through it to the consequences of acting out of anger, before these decisions are made. The characters stay true to their personalities. Good and bad is not as obvious as it seems even in the most selfish cast members. The cast is great. Jennifer Aniston puts in a great performance as does Harry Conick Jr. The entire cast was fantastic. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston make a cameo appearance as train conductors as well. The animation itself shows us the possibilites of seamless 2D/3D animation as well. You never see the giant as out of place or visually jarring. His place is firmly seeded in the environment that we see him in. If animation has a hope it is in stories like these. Get this movie. You will  love this story.
Minor technical issues with this dvd have to do with the compression, which can be seen in some of the larger expanses of color in this film.
Most of the reviews that are 3 stars or less have to do with the fact that people don't like the swearing or the perceived anti-gun message of this movie. I take issue with both of these counts because they are story appropriate. Cursing happens under extreme duress of the characters who (in character) swear in their exasperation. The title character is a weapon from another planet. He is a gun. He chooses (get that ?!?) not to act violently. This person chooses not to kill. That is the whole premise of the story. These were concerns with Warner Brothers and it caused the botching of this amazing movie because of thier concern that people like this would not be happy. What a sad state to be in. Held in check by the lowest common cultureal denominator. Now if you are someone who is concerned with this, I'd suggest watching other great animated stories that you can see daily on TV like The Simpsons.
Having said this, if you do find yourself in need of a story that touches the mind and the heart. If you can see the morals, the true value(s) of this film will give you something enjoy and share with your loved ones.",1051315200,,2278,4.462829736211031
1252367,5,B000028U3R,"It's always cool to see movies you're dying to see and not be disappointed. Although when you see a movie you're not expecting much out of and it turns out to be one of your favorites, you can appreciate it that much more.  Such is the case with The Iron Giant- a brilliant animated classic.
The Iron Giant is mainly about a kid named Hogarth who discovers a giant robot who falls out of the sky. A government agency is tracking it down, mainly by Kent Mansley, who sees it as a threat to humanity. Hogarth enlists the help of Dean McCoppin, a scrapyard owner, to hide the giant.
The one thing I immediately noticed about this movie is that it very much doesn't have what society expects in animated features. There's no convoluted love story. There's no out-of-place singing and dancing. There's no plucky animal comic relief. All this is pushed aside to concentrate on an excellent story that never feels sappy or cliche. Of course it still has some great comedy bits and lines. I couldn't help but laugh out loud at anything that was played on the television and Dean's little squirrel mishap.
As for the animation, it's excellent as well. The Iron Giant character may be computer generated but he's digitally colored to fit in with his surroundings and it completely works. One scene where the giant is shot out of the sky and crashes into the ground is extremely well done. The characters are very likable and Kent Mansley is one of the best ""villains"" in any animated movie.
I really wish they could have added more to the DVD extras.  The only main extra is a behind-the-scenes that aired on TV.  Let's hope a deluxe edition will eventually be released one day so the movie can get the proper DVD treatment.
Warner Brothers should have had more faith in this one, as it was so poorly marketed.  There's nothing I can say I didn't like about this movie.  It ranks just behind Princess Mononoke as my favorite animated movie of all time.
And I have one thing to say to the people who bought it for their young kids and complained-
PG- Parental guidance suggested, some material may not be suitable for children.  This rating has been around for decades.  It's nothing that should come as a surprise.",1047427200,9,2204,4.5786802030456855

The characters are likeable, with the exception of the sterotypical paranoid government agent.  The story line for the first two thirds of the movie is both funny and touching.  Unfortunately, it goes down hill from there.
After throughly enjoying the first two-thirds of movie, my viewing experience was ruined when the later third degenerated into an anti-gun rights, anti-government diatribe.
If you want your children indoctrinated into that type of extreme left-wing dogma, then this is the movie for you.  Otherwise, I recommend you skip this one.",1047254400,15,724,5.093220338983051
1252369,4,B000028U3R,"One day during the usual boring times that can come with summer, there was an all day marathon of ""The Iron Giant"" featured on the cartoon network.  Wondering to myself that if a movie is to be on for 24 hours straight that it must be worth seeing no matter what (look at the classic like 'A Christmas Story' being played 24 hours and tell me you haven't seen it at least once).  I watched for the next showing and sat down and watched it.  I was immediately impressed to see the animation had its own style, it was neither Disney, nor trying too hard to be realistic (such as the almost caricature head shape of Mansley).  Next, the movie does not fail in the least bit to deliver convincing voice overs from the actors, Jennifer Anniston does a great job of bringing her character to life and one even forgets that she is playing the part.  The relationship that develops between the boy and the robot becomes very strong.  Some deeper meanings present in the movie are the robot being a tool of destruction, yet being completely oblivious (and therefore innocent) to its powers.  This movie cannot simply be brushed aside as a cartoon, it is an incredible movie, and you may even forget that's what you are actually watching.",1046908800,,1228,4.529411764705882

With the voices of Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Anniston, Vin Diesel, Christopher McDonald and Jon Mahoney you're bound to get something that has appeal for all ages.  True, the story might be appear to be a children's tale, but it also takes place in a time when the US was suspicious of anything and everything that appears foreign.  The Giant is definitely foreign.  It's also clueless about how to behave on earth.  That is until he meets Hogarth (who saves him from being electrocuted to death).  Hogarth's next priority was to teach the Giant more about human life and find a place to hide it.  A government agent soon comes to town asking about any strange occurences that might have happened recently.  When he discovers the truth, he is hell bent on destroying this thing (even at the cost of all the lives in a small town in Maine).  Does the town side with Hogarth or this agent?  What happens to the giant?  That's for you to find out ;).
This film is a touching story of friendship, protection and loyalty.  We're naturally scared when we see something unfamiliar to us, but Hogarth sets aside his fear and saves the Giant from death in their first encounter.  The Giant begins to understand that it can't just go around eating and destroying everything in its way and trusts the boy to do the right thing and keep it safe.  Later on, and perhaps in the most touching part of the story, the Giant learns that friendship means protecting the ones we love.  And it does just that.
I wish the film could have been longer and the DVD more feature-laden.  This DVD only includes a 30-minute, TV-aired special about the making of the film, some actor filmographies, and a trailer.
I highly recommend this as a family film.  I even think that in some ways, it's on par with other Disney classics.

I ended up seeing this film 10 times in theatres over a two-month period. The film's trailer initially brought it to my attention. After I saw THE IRON GIANT on opening day, I had to see again and again and so fourth. Needless to say, I liked the film very much. I consider it one of my favorite films. Why? That is not an easy answer. All I can say is that I genuinely consider this to be a GOOD film and it has some enigmatic heartfelt intrinsic value to many that see it. It is not just a kid's film. It is not just a family film. It is a film for everyone. After my second or third viewing in theatres, I became interested in the audience's reactions. There was always a cheer or a sniffle or a shed tear rolling down a cheek. I remember one father saying to a gang of kids when the movie was over, "" That was a good one. We should have taken mommy with us."" I thought I was alone in my reaction to this film. After I got hooked up to the Internet, I found that there were literally thousands of people who were also moved by this film. And it seems that we all repeated one act of endorsement: we told as many people as we could to go see THE IRON GIANT. The closest I can come to saying why I liked THE IRON GIANT is that it somehow made me reflect on my life's experiences in a very nostalgic and endearing way, yet it did not let me forget that we still grow and learn new experiences every new day.

1252381,5,B000028U3R,"It is a shame that Warner Brothers chose to give an uninspired prerelease publicity campaign to the gentle, joyous and original animated movie, The Iron Giant. Precious few saw it in theaters.
Thank God for film preservation in the form of DVD!
Like the book, the picture takes place in 1957, during the height of The Cold War. The Soviet Union's satellite, Sputnik, flies across American skies. Our country is filled with paranoia. What else may they have launched?
One stormy night off the coast of Maine, a huge object falls from the sky. A frightened sailor sees it and swears that it is a giant made of metal. The townsfolk chalk the tale off to the sailor's love of drink. A giant made of metal, indeed!
A night or so later, young Hogarth Hughes, whose Mom is working overtime at the local diner, gets mad when his TV starts acting up. He goes to the roof to check the antenna and finds it missing. He then notices huge footprints leading away from the house and into the woods. He grabs his deceased Dad's old army rifle and a flashlight and goes off in pursuit. He soon discovers that there is indeed a metal giant. In fact, he saves it when it bumps into some high voltage utility wires. The adventure has begun.
Rarely has a movie for children - or adults! - addressed the need to search for a peaceful solution to our problems as gently or as wisely as The Iron Giant. It never preaches and is always accessible. It does not address us from on high. It remains at our level. It also shows how clever we can be at overcoming the most unexpected obstacles. It reminds us that things alien to us are not always hostile to us. In fact, it is we who often initiate the hostilities. Perhaps best of all, The Iron Giant examines these and other issues in the guise of a wonderful story that should hold almost anyone's attention.
The animation is first-rate. Most of the voices are good, especially Harry Connick, Jr.'s as Dean Cooper, a hip young artist. As Hogath's voice, Eli Marienthal speaks like a real boy, not a cartoon boy. Speaking for Hogarth's mother, Annie, Jennifer Anniston gives her a loving quality. Vin Diesel does well with the most difficult voice, that of The Iron Giant.
Rated PG for a couple of spooky scenes and a few mild profanities. Recommended without reservation for children seven and up.",1016668800,180,2322,4.544152744630072

THIS is the kind of homegrown animated feature film American audiences have been waiting decades for! No nausiating operatic renditions, no insulting goofy sidekicks, no talking anthropomorphized animals, no tapdancing kitchen appliances -- No Dumbing Down!
Warner Bros. appears to have grasped something that other U.S. film studios with animation divisions still quite haven't yet: Warner understands that there is a REASON ''Nippon no Anime'' feature films have such a huge worldwide appeal! DreamWorks SKG still seems to want to mimic the Disney model (though taking their themes to a somewhat higher, more mature level) -- which really should come as no surprise, since former Disney icon, Jeffery Katzenburg, is now one of the major driving forces at DreamWorks SKG, and many former Disney animators are also now part of the DreamWorks team, while Disney appears to be ''playing it safe'' by sticking to the old, non-varying ''Disney Standard'' with their own ''in house'' productions and choosing, instead, to merely acquire the American rights to popular established Japanese anime features like ''Mononoke Hime.'' Warner's ''THE IRON GIANT,'' by contrast, breaks with the tired and worn American tradition and presents a very beautiful animated feature with a very beautiful story.
The animation for ''THE IRON GIANT'' still reflects a strong American artistic style -- which is not necessarily a bad thing, since it supplies the viewer with a comfortable ''familiarity'' and not a sense ''foreignness'' or slight alienation. But as the story unfolds it immediately begins to sink in that this is NOT some typicical ''kiddie cartoon'' movie; that it is unique as homemade animated features are concerned; that it is a melding of animation and good storytelling that places it light-years ahead of your average run-of-the-mill Disney animated feature. Also, the marriage of traditional ''cel animation'' with ''CGI,'' as used in this film, flows very smoothly and believably -- it is one of those rare films where the two radically different animation ''technologies,'' if you will, compliment one another and work perfectly together, rather than clashing with each other and distracting the viewer. (Rintarou's ''METROPOLIS'' is the ultimate example of a ''cel/CGI'' wedding gone bad!)
Playing it straighter than most American animated features geared toward a younger audience, ''THE IRON GIANT's'' real beauty is in its storytelling -- Not only is it a delight to watch for its warm & touching ''lighthearted'' moments, but it is also a very powerful and thought provoking experience, revisiting some of the old morality play standards such as friendship, acceptance, personal responsibility, and the freedom to decide one's own life course.
Set in a small New England seaside village in the 1950s-- during an era when ''Red Menace,'' extra-terrestrial and atomic bomb paranoias are the order of the day --''THE IRON GIANT'' follows the adventures of Hogarth Hughes, a young boy who is the only child in a single parent household. One night, when Hogarth's mom is asked to work late, he discovers evidence of what he assumes to be ''invaders from Mars'' -- a belief inspired by the earlier rantings of a supposed ''eyewitness'' who claims to have had an actual physical encounter with one of the ''Martians.'' Armed with his pellet rifle, Hogarth marches off into the woods around his house looking for he-has-no-idea-what and encounters the title character ... a towering robot with a deadly secret.
As a result of the unpredictable events which take place during that first encounter, an unusual bond forms between these two unlikely and lonely souls: Hogarth, who has few friends, and the ''metal man,'' who finds itself alone in a foreign place with no memory of who it is, where it's from, or what its ''purpose'' is.
But the evidence of the robot's activities do not go unnoticed by the Government, which suspects that Russian activity may be at play in the small town. Kent Mansley, a fiery and relentless ''Commiephobe'' is dispatched by Washington to investigate and eventually comes to suspect-- and later prove --that the metal giant does in fact exist and that Hogarth is somehow connected with it, resulting in our young hero's attempt to stay one step ahead of their pursuer, which includes enlisting the aid of a new friend, Dean, who also happens to have the perfect hideout for a gigantic ''metal-eating'' machine.
Despite the fact that a suspension of logic and reason is required in order to get past the ''metal-eating robot that can experience physical hunger'' sub-theme (just go with it), the entire movie plays out very well, right down to its heroic, tear-jerking climax. ''THE IRON GIANT'' would, without question, be one of my first picks for a ''Top Ten'' favorite movies of all time list (...and that's not a statement I make lightly). My only regret is that I never got the chance to see it on the big screen when it played in theatres.
Simultaneously humorous and dramic, I strongly recommend ''THE IRON GIANT'' for adults as well as for its younger target demographic. To miss out on this one is to truly miss out on something special.

1252385,4,B000028U3R,"&%$#@*  I would give ""The Iron Giant"" five stars if it had been made--as it so easily COULD have been--without the use of several unnecessary expletives.  My children are young, and I simply insist on shielding them from all swear words whenever possible.  I rented the video and have decided not to buy a copy for my children due only to the fact that mild oaths like 'Sweet Mother of God,' 'damn,' and 'what the hell,' etc. are used.  Why do filmmakers think that American mothers approve of cursing in movies intended for young audiences?  I'd love to see DVD technology developed that would allow a parent to play a ""censored"" version of any given movie without the cuss-words.  My kids don't need to hear them!!  I'm sure they'll hear those words soon enough at school--or from their cousins!!
Aside from the inappropriate language used in several spots in the film, there is little else to dislike about ""The Iron Giant.""  The characters are likable and believable, the messages of friendship and trust shine through, and the movie doesn't have a soundtrack full of catchy tunes blasted at full volume; in fact, I don't recall hearing music that was intrusive at all.  That, in my opinion, is one hallmark of a well-made film.  Grown-ups watching ""Iron Giant"" will catch some of the less-obvious jokes embedded in the film; watch for the air-raid drill film Hogarth and his classmates are shown at school.  I enjoyed this movie, but if you buy it, I recommend that parents watch it with their children so that they can answer the questions that will surely follow about the cold war, sophisticated weaponry, etc.  ""Iron Giant"" deserves your consideration; it seems to have been overlooked to some extent when it was originally released.",1012176000,4,1742,4.828282828282828

My favorite scene in the movie is the ""kitchen"" scene. It always makes me laugh. This movie has all the things that makes a movie great; characters you care about, generous doses of awe & wonder, humor and sadness. I gave this movie 5 stars only because I couldn't give it even HIGHER marks. This film didn't get the box office it deserved when it was released.  Warner Bros. evidently didn't know what they had.

1252388,5,B000028U3R,"We bought this movie for the kids, but after watching it the first time, we knew that this was one my wife and I could enjoy just as much as the kids.  The basic plot of the movie is this:  The Iron Giant, an alien robot of tremendous size and power, crash-lands on Earth for reasons unknown.  Although the Giant has the power to ""fix"" physical damage, he has somehow been damaged mentally so that he has lost memory of all of his powers.  His crash-landing does not go unnoticed by the government, which sends an agent to investigate (the story is set in 1957, at the height of Sputnik-inspired paranoia).  Meanwhile, the Giant has made the acquaintance of young Hogarth Hobbs, a boy living with his working mom in a small Maine town.  The whereabouts of Hogarth's dad are never explicity made clear, but you do get a brief glimpse of a photo in Hogarth's room of a fighter pilot and his plane, presumably Dad, lost in Korea (just my theory).  The story pretty much revolves around the agent's attempts to find the Giant (with the aid of a few indiscretions by Hogarth, who really needs to keep better track of his stuff), and Hogarth's attempts to keep the Giant away from the government's clutches, while at the same time developing a relationship with the Giant that is very reminiscent of Elliot and E.T.  Hogarth gets some help in this effot from Dean, the local hippie type who runs the local junkyard (which is good for the Giant, who needs to eat scrap metal to survive).
At first, the Giant seems to be nothing more than a big robot.  But, as Hogarth learns to communicate with him, we learn that the Giant has feelings and a big heart.  He doesn't want to play ""bad robot"" to Hogarth's pretend space hero, he wants to be Superman!  You can't help but like the big lug.
The movie is well-written, with a lot of absolutely hilarious comedy as well as some real tear-jerker moments.  The quality of the animation is top-notch, especially the scene near the end when the Giant (who can fly) is being confronted by three VERY well-drawn F-86 Sabre jets.

The values celebrated in this film are hard to argue with: you choose your path in life, you alone are in control of your behavior, violence is to be avoided at all costs, love and friendship are precious, because it is unknown does not mean it must be feared or destroyed.

This is an incredible, intelligent and thought provoking film that transcends genre.  The animation is top notch, with a seamless blend of computer images and traditional cell animation.  There is a style to this film that I have not seen in an American animated film since ""Sleeping Beauty.""  The whole picture is a 50's pulp magazine cover come to life.  Authentic period music supports the scenery.  There is even an animated version of ""The Brain from Planet Arous"" on TV.

The Iron Giant meets a small boy, Hogarth (named after illustrator Burne Hogarth).  Hogarth uses his stack of Superman comics to teach the Giant about good and evil.  Kent Mansley is a federal agent, infected with McCarthy era xenophobia, who wants to destroy the Giant with the rational that  if it is not American it cannot be trusted.  Hogarth's mother and Dean McCoppin, a local beatnik, round out the cast and provide a romantic subtext.

Just this evening we watched it for the zillionth time, with him entranced, and me (again) marvelling over the attention to minute details, the fully-fleshed out plots and sub plots, and the great voice talent.
""The Iron Giant"" is the story of Hogarth, growing up in the 1950s with a single, hard working mother. It is the era of Sputnik, ""duck and cover"" movies, and bad sci-fi movies. Hogarth is an outcast poindexter in school and a wild, imaginative handful at home. He befriends the Iron Giant after discovering that he's a good guy who won't hurt him. Of course, it's up to Hogarth to prove that to all of America.
Each time I watch this I notice something different. Sure, there are the obvious jokes. But there are subtler touches in the story (the Cold War sub-plot issues are great) and animation (just watch how the Iron Giant imitates how Hogarth sits down) that take this way beyond any of the recent Disney movies. Even the ""big name"" star Jennifer Aniston stands out in her understated and wonderful rendering of a concerned, tired, sweet mother. Harry Connick Jr.'s character (an art building  beatnik) is fantastic with deep-set eyes and constant six o'clock shadow.

With a plot (and a strong one) that leads the story into new places, this film will put a smile on the faces of both the children and the parents. One nice thing is that this film does not include a song and dance number, or any talking animals voiced by semi famous celebrities. This film relies only on its own merit, and succeeds beautifully.",977529600,5,835,4.4640522875816995
1252410,5,B000028U3R,"The Iron Giant choked in the box office, buried under a deluge of flashy films, all of which suffered from a serious dearth of heart and soul. It didn't help that the advertising campaign was painfully bad, embedding a pretense of ""crappy kids' movie."" And, of course, the animated motion picture genre is decidedly handcuffed by Disney, and any non-Disney flick is sure to elicit cynicism from the kids (the prime demographic for a movie like this).
But forget all that...The Iron Giant is a fine movie. Actually, I would go as far as to say it's the best animated movie I've ever seen.
Forget everything you've ever thought about animated films. Just for kids...bad script...juvenile humor...long, boring music numbers...talking animal sidekicks with lame one-liners... Forget it all. Instead of staying shackled to convention, The Iron Giant eschews all the faults associated with other animated films, and simply delivers a charming film that anyone can enjoy. Pardon the clich, but in this case, it is absolutely true.
The Iron Giant's story is delightfully captivating in all its exquisitely crafted facets. The script is irresistible, tastefully witty, and profoundly moving. Time and time again, I marveled at how a single scene could be better than entire movies. The giant robot character is a stranger in a strange land, and his (mis)adventures with Hogarth (the young boy who befriends the robot) are accompanied with elegant humor, but sometimes the lighthearted moments relinquish themselves to emotionally-stirring segments. If the ending doesn't have you holding back tears, you simply aren't human. The iron giant himself succeeds in being the ideal non-human character with a very important human element, and that's one of the greatest merits of this movie's story.
From a technical standpoint, the animation is simply breathtaking. Special accolade goes to the technique used on the iron giant himself. He is rendered with computers graphics, but with a special cel-shading technique that makes him look hand-drawn. This allows him to seamlessly blend in with the hand-drawn environments and other characters.
Some people will certainly pass by The Iron Giant. They'll return to their Disney flicks -- movies that are so engineered to be impressive that they somehow fail. These people will never know what they missed. That is because The Iron Giant is so much more than any other animated movie. It's a ride through a timeless story and human emotion that few movies match, much less animated films. Lofty praise, certainly, but every word of it is sincere and true. Watch it, and you'll agree.",977356800,17,2616,5.1867612293144205

Looking briefly at the front cover, I could gather little desire to ""pop it in"" and sit back to what I thought would be a boring story and even less interesting animation. There it sat on top of the VCR until this Thanksgiving when I figured I was way overdue in returning it. So, with time and indifference to burn, I blew the dust off the VCR and, lucky for me, it still worked. Almost immediately I was drawn in by the quality of the animation; honest to goodness animation, not over-the-top CGI. I start paying attention. As the story unfolded an amazing thing happened. I was that little boy, feeling surprise, fear, happiness, anger, contempt, sadness, respect and love. I forgot I was watching an animated film, and began living an unforgettable experience. The Iron Giant is a beautifully crafted film built around a touching story with high moral value that is guaranteed to entertain.

It's characters are honest portrayals of people in the 1950s..A single parent family trying to make ends meet, A beatik who likes to express himself through art, and townspeople who are afraid of nuclear war. Try finding that in Disney drivel. What I like is how one kids simplicity can change a symbol of war into a beacon of peace (that being the Iron Giant). The film is full of humor. The scene where Dean has to unzip his pants to let out Hogarth's new pet is hilarious. Another funny scene is where Hogarth is wired up on Expresso. There are also heartfelt scenes where the Iron Giant goes through the emotions of being emotional. I feel for the Giant because I know what it is like to be lonely and on the outside. Another quality that I applaud is the Giant decides to do the right thing rather than what he was programmed for. The animation was superb and the soundtrack was full of 50s gems. I am one of the many on this list that think it deserved more attention in advertising (instead WB throws the spotlight on ho-hum films like Space Jam).

We both walked out of there choked up with smiles on our  faces. I can honestly say that the movie rekindled that sense of wonder we  all have as children. This isn't some saccharine-Hollywood-hype quote, but  a genuine description of my emotions. When the Giant picks up Hogarth in  his hand, you get that rush of childhood that you thought dies when you get  older. This movie doesn't pander to little kids, but entertains them even  more than the lesser Disney films. Is it just me, or are the older Disney  films better than new ones? The film is deep and involving and will have  you glued to the screen. The film comments on the time period (1950's) with  a wink to the older, wiser adults. The voices are perfect. Harry Connick,  Jr. steals the show as the beatnik artist Dean and Eli Marenthal (Hogarth  Hughes) is great because his emotions are genuine and well voiced. Kudos to  Brad Bird for not making Hogarth some smart alec punk with  ""attitude"". The kid is an outsider with a huge heart. It's  because of these attributes everyone feels for him at the end. The other  character so richly drawn is the Giant. He is more three-dimensional than  most characters in live films. It's scary folks, but it's true. I don't  want to give away the plot so I won't write much more about it. The  plotline is beautiful and flows from one scene to the next. It's too much  fun to reveal it here.

1. If it's animation, it  has to be written in a condescending tone (for children, of course), and
2. Be chock-full of songs to make the movie a musical.
So, with the  Iron Giant someone decided to toss those ideas out the window. The details  are what make this movie a howl: from the wooden acting in the B-movie  Hogarth watches, to the pervading ""Red Scare"" attitude throughout  (which we can laugh at now, in retrospect, but was a deadly serious fear in  the 50's in which the movie is set).
The movie's counter-culture (for the  squeaky-clean 1950's) roots can be seen in the placing of Top-Secret  Government Agent (NSA? CIA? We never do find out) Kent Mansley as the  villian, and Beatnik junkyard artist Dean as the only other adult in which  Hogarth can confide the secret of the giant.
It's all here for everyone -  I saw this movie last night and was still amazed my wonder and emotions  were the same the first time I had seen it (after it had pretty much gone  to video scant months after it appeared in theatres in the U.S. - Puerto  Rico never saw this gem in theatres) nearly a year ago.

But ignore the  brainless trailers and the awful extreme-sport ad campaign that accompanied  the video release, and you'll be rewarded with an astonishing film.
The  Iron Giant is complex and sophisticated enough to be a live-action movie,  indeed more complex and sophisticated than the movies that trounced it at  the box office (I'm talking to you, Inspector Gadget).  It is a remarkable  achievement of all the elements of a movie working at their very  best.
The visuals are astounding.  The script is funny without resorting  to cheap laughs.  The characters are well-rounded.  The voice talents are  ideal, from the Giant's rumble to Hogarth's wide-eyed wonder (for a welcome  change, a pre-adolescent boy does the voice instead of someone trying to  sound like one).
Most interestingly, the movie makes such a dynamic,  empathic character of the titular hunk of metal that we genuinely care  about his fate.  At the film's climactic scene, I was ashamed at the tears  running down my face, until I saw that my three friends (all of us  twenty-something, manly guys) were misty-eyed as well.

I also do not remember any 1950's communist  paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young. But the  changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine.  There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices  is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.
But  the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero. It's cool to watch him learn  simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic. I  like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the  junkyard. You cannot dislike the Iron Giant.
I think it was a wise and  creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1. Most cartoons by Disney  are in 1.85:1 or even worse...in 1.66:1. Warner did a great job with this  movie. These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all  the feature length animations. But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this  movie.

Sound  familiar? Say one thing for ""The Iron Giant"": if you have to  model your tale on an earlier film, you could do a lot worse than choose  Steven Spielberg's timeless masterpiece, ""E.T. - the  Extraterrestrial."" The good news too is that, derivative as this new  film is - it plays at times almost like a scene-by-scene remake of the  previous film - ""The Iron Giant"" is quite a charmer in its own  right as well. It is a rare pleasure to see an animated film so rooted in  the real world. So many of them take us to such exotic places - for the  obvious reason that animated films, by their very nature, simply CAN - that  all too often we feel distanced from what is taking place on the screen  before us. By setting this film in the recognizable world of 1950's  America, the makers establish a tone of unfrenetic charm and tranquility  that plays well as a background for the sci-fi elements of the tale. The  film also becomes a beautiful reflection on the strange coexistence of  scientific idealism and trepidation that took hold of the imagination in  that early era of space exploration and nuclear gamesmanship - an uneasy  amalgam that found its way into many of the science fiction films of the  time.
The dialogue in the film enhances the gentle tone of the story  without resorting to either maudlin sentimentalilty or sardonic cynicism.  Hogarth, the boy, is simply a curious, well intentioned young lad, a bit  smarter than most perhaps but not a budding genius (one of the wittiest  lines comes when he bemoans the fact that other boys tease him because he  is so much smarter than them when really the only difference is that he  STUDIES). ""The Iron Giant"" manages to instill a number of such  subtle life lessons as these without straining the point or becoming  pedantic about it - although the ""guns kill"" theme, obviously  designed to infuriate NRA members, does come across as a bit  heavyhanded.
The use of widescreen yields a number of tremendously  beautiful moments of visual splendour, and the giant himself is especially  impressive. Again, though, the animation is always placed at the service of  the material; we are not subjected to a barrage of meaningless flashy  images for their own sweet sake. ""The Iron Giant"" may feel overly  familiar - and it will never replace ""E.T."" as the definitive  version of this story - but it is definitely a film well worth seeing, an  animated film that will indeed appeal to audiences of all ages.",964742400,,2831,4.748971193415638

1252430,5,B000028U3R,"Of course, it is only to be expected that US will produce something to make fun of its anti-Soviet propaganda only when the Soviet Union itself is in shambles. Nevertheless, The Iron Giant is amazingly powerful and very  believable.
There are two stories going on at the same time. The first,  obvious story is geared towards children, as young Hogarth Hughes  ""befriends"" a giant robot from space who apparently had his  memory wiped out when he tried to eat a power plant (not as silly as it  sounds). This story is filled with the standard cartoon slapstick comedy  and the casual childish gag. Thankfully, there are no songs within sight  (most reviewers noticed this). In fact, none would befit this animated film  (I have difficulty imagining giant robots sing).
The second, subtler  story is the debunkment of the Cold War-era anti-Soviet (and anti-non-US in  general) propaganda, as Hogarth tries to conceal the fifty-foot-tall  behemoth, fails, and has a forceful, nosy agent (and eventually an entire  army) tracking his every move - naturally, the government is quite  displeased with the robot. This story, on the other hand, has quite a few  adult-oriented jokes (not, not in that sense). For example, Hogarth feeds a  laxative to the agent to stop him from following, and the duck-'n-cover  thing that recurs in the beginning and the finale. Both stories interweave  quite frequently, so a rather mature-minded child will have no difficulty  following the action.
Finally, the film has a rather good ending (marred  only by the few last seconds that were obviously tacked on to stop the  younger audience from being too sad, although, if you're emotional enough,  you might appreciate it). The art is quite grand, and the frequent use of  perspective is very effective in conveying the giant's size. Very, very  enjoyable.",962841600,3,1836,5.046666666666667

We adored it so much that I bought the DVD so that we could watch it again and again; I also wanted to be certain that my 17 month old son and 2 month old  daughter would have the wonderful opportunity to see it when they were the  appropriate age.
Other reviews have described the story in detail. What I  want to say is that there is a reason this story is so affecting. Hidden  within is an ancient myth of a being who comes from afar, is misunderstood  and persecuted by the paranoid people he walks among, (warning: story  spoiler follows)goes on to sacrifice himself to save humankind, and in the  end is resurrected. This is a powerful retelling of a world-transforming  myth. It is not my personal myth, but it is a profoundly spiritual story.  And unlike more pretentious movies, and especially, novels, the mythic or  spiritual aspect is not obvious. I laughed and cried, and that is unusual  for me.
I read the original Ted Hughes novella with my daughter, and  must say that the film's writers vastly and creatively improved on the  original. Ted Hughes is a fine poet, but this movie is, for once, much,  much better than the book.

Now this dazzling new movie finally comes up with wonderful, well-developed characters, very  professional animation, lots of fast-paced action that no eye can ever  follow, simply GORGEOUS art graphics, and a very stern message regarding  xenophobia and the need to respect life.
It takes place in late 1950s,  when America was still gripped in its fears of a cold war, a young boy  stays alone at home watching cheesy sci-fi movies while his pretty young  mother worked late into night at the local diner. Then he hears some funny  noises, so he goes investigating and thus runs smack into the most unlikely  friend he would ever make: a towering robot who could gobble up cars and  flatten entire forest areas.

1252436,5,B000028U3R,"Animated films often get a bum rap from conventional filmgoers because they are so frequently tailored towards children. The Iron Giant, however, definitely runs counter to this trend. I'm not even sure young kids will  enjoy this as much as their parents will.
The film is centered around  Hogarth's discovery of a giant robot in his small Northeastern town. Very  quickly, people find out, and all hell breaks loose, but in the meantime,  Hogarth teaches the robot about life, in his own wonderfully childlike way.  The anthropomorphism of the Giant is remarkable--he is very humanlike, and  easy to feel for.
The animation is top-notch, with a nice retro feel.  The computer animated Iron Giant merits mention as well.
It's a  wonderful film, albeit a tad predictable, and sometimes the message is  pretty blatant. Definitely worth watching, for the child AND the parent.",960422400,3,874,5.098591549295775

The key point this movie makes is that a  person chooses their own path and their own destiny. One can not say  ""I was born blah blah"" and then go on to what they feel they are  fated to do. The Iron Giant was born a ""gun"" yet he chooses to be  so much more. I can not watch the ending of this film without getting a  tear in my eye. If all of us would only learn this one lesson, the world  would be a more pleasant place to live.
It took two viewings to really  get all the subtle meanings of some of the scenes. I urge parents to  discuss with their children the message of this movie with their kids. Let  them know it is their choice whether to be ""a gun"" or  ""Superman."" Maybe in some small way this movie can help them to  make the right choice.
Don't get me wrong, this is not a preachy movie. I  hate that. Instead this film shows the pressures and feelings the robot has  in a comical and sometimes moving way without ever feeling like it has  ""a message.""

Nevertheless, The Iron Giant just shines on its  own.
Set in the 50s when the Red Scare had its paranoid grip on the  public, The Iron Giant uses all the cultural nuances of that period to its  advantage. Humorous touches like the absurd newsreel on protecting yourself  against a nuclear bomb and scenes from old horror films add to the feel of  paranoia during that period, and set the stage for the Iron Giant's  entrance into the sleepy town where little Hogarth and his mother live. Of  course, the secret friendship between the boy and the giant do not last  long, and what ensues is masterful storytelling and great animation.
So,  sit down with your friends, your spouse, your kids, or your grandparents  and watch this film. It's fun, it's touching, and it's definitely worth the  price of admission.",957830400,2,1049,4.7032967032967035
1252444,4,B000028U3R,"I think the best fantasy films have a firm grasp on reality before they introduce the fantasmical.  ET, for example, establishes Elliot and his family long before ET's arrival.  Then when ET does arrive, we can see him  more ""realistically"" than if Elliot had lived in a floating house  with a robot for a mom.  See what I mean?
Well, maybe not, but  regardless, I rented The Iron Giant because I had heard terrific things  about it.  And much like ET, the film begins with Hogarth (yeah, that's the  kids name in this movie) and his mom (voiced by Jennifer Aniston) going  through their day to day.  Actually, the movie begins with a vignette  involving a boat lost at sea and the Iron Giant's arrival, but it's really  brief.
The movie was strangely effective.  I think my generation can't  really appreciate animation because we grew up with it.  We tend to forget  how impressive it truly is to animate pictures...for people to draw things  and bring them to life.  And the interesting thing about this movie is that  the animation feels so real.  I mean, you never forget that the people are  cartoons, but the visuals seem so life-like.  The Giants head is sort of  spherical, and you can see the roundness of it...and that's one thing I'm  always impressed by; drawing roundness.  I never could do it...
The  message of the movie is more complex than your normal cartoon.  The Giant  is actually a big weapon but he only becomes a weapon when being attacked  and so the army comes and attacks him and he turns into a huge  machine....but that's later on.
This movie did so many things I didn't  expect.  I really do recommend it....you'll enjoy it.",957571200,2,1655,4.596551724137931
1252445,5,B000028U3R,"This is an animated movie which doesn't try to be.  By that I mean it doesn't conform to what has become the standard for American animation. For too long there has been a culture to imitate Disney's style.  Fox and  Dreamworks, but to name a few, have done this; to be fair, sometimes with  great success (Anastasia, Prince of Egypt) and sometimes not.  I admit that  I love these movies but would still like to see something slightly more  original. It seems that there has been a fear amongst film makers, that the  public won't accept anything else...wake up call!  Iron Giant has broken  this mould and given us one of the best  animated films ever.  There's no  singing or dancing; no cute little animals prancing around and the  animation even steps away from the genre's typified tradition of square  jaw, pouty lips and doughy eyes.  So what does this movie have then?  The  answer to that is simply ""everything!""
It is best not to look  at it in terms of it being an animated picture because this instantly  clouds the judgment on what it is capable of.  This film really is  different to your normal animated movies. The story is far more intelligent  and involving than most others; yet it still retains  a sense of fun and  innocence, qualities which have helped to make the genre so charming. The  films characters are also great and the interaction between them provides  many great moments.  It is somehow always easier to attatch yourself to an  animated character than a human acting the part, this is definately the  case with this movie.  This story, about a boy who discovers a huge robot  and befriends it, had more of an emotional effect on me than any other  film. Films rarely make me cry but this one definately brought a tear or  two to my eyes.
The dvd itself doesn't let the side down either.  It  offers amazing 5.1 digital sound which picks up the tiniest of detail in  the movies stunning soundtrack, giving an enjoyable assault on your ears.  The picture quality is equally adept, dealing admirably with the films  gorgeous colours. This is an all round great film, perfect for those  ""family evenings"".  So well done Warner Bros; I wonder how long  it will be until the following pack are unleashing their own offerings onto  the market?  Goodluck to them.",957571200,2,2290,4.6457286432160805

1252448,5,B000028U3R,"I'll start this review saying that the technical aspects of this film are fantastic. The animation is top notch for American standards, and the computer generated Giant is blended in seamlessly. ""The Iron Giant"" is easily the best American animated film from a studio other than Disney.
Now for the main reason why I wrote this review. This film possesses something that no Disney film has had for a long time: Innocence. ""The Iron Giant"" takes place in 1957, during the early years of the Cold War. It is a time when anything foreign and not understood is feared and treated as a threat. This setting allows for the presentation of the innocent parts. Basic messages such as 'Guns Are Bad,' 'Violence Doesn't Solve Anything,' and 'Everyone Dies Eventually' are delivered with the cinematic skill and emotional grace that many so-called 'Films With A Message' ignore, making them look like the contrived mess they are. The final act is so emotional and heart-breaking, that I cry every time I see it, and choke up when I think of it. Very few animated films have this kind of impact these days.
I am upset that ""The Iron Giant"" didn't do very well in the 'Box Office Battle.' It deserved so much more. Warner Brothers has got to improve on the way they advertise and package their films, because this and many others have done so poorly.
For the benefit of your inner child, and for the actual children that some of you may have, I highly recommend that you add this to your DVD or VHS collection. I hope that you enjoy its many levels as much as I have.
I have only one negative statement. The current version on DVD is a 2-sided, single-layered disc, with widescreen on one side and full-frame on the other. There should be a new special edition (possible 2-disc set,) to be released later this year.  That is if Warner Brothers doesn't screw up again.",955670400,8,1854,4.618181818181818

It's possible to see where CGI is used,  but it no longer stands out glaringly on the screen, making for a much  smoother viewing. Disney is good, but they SHOULD take this movie as an  object lesson in how to present a story honestly.

The real strength of this film is that both adults and children  will enjoy it because it works on several levels.

Either way, the great equalizer (home video) has stepped up to give everyone another chance at what has to be one of,if not  THE, best animated features of all time. Oh sure, you could easily opt for  the entire WALL of Tarzan videos that are currently jamming the rental  shelves ( I wouldn't-see my review) but don't be lulled/fooled by the  Mouse's sales pitch, Iron Giant has forgotten more about being a great  movie than Tarzan ever knew. Set in the 50's, the Iron Giant is the story  of young Hogarth Hughes, a lively and likable little guy who's mother works  in the local cafe. Hogarth has a nasty habit of bringing home strays, so  naturally who better to stumble upon the amnesiac Iron Giant shortly after  he crash lands from space? Of course, if you think it's easy playing  nursemaid to a giant metal-eating robot then just stick around. Hogarth  ends up having to hide the Giant from his mother, an overzealous G-Man  investigating the rash of 'monster' sightings and pretty-much the whole  town in general. This he manages by forming a new friendship with Dean, the  local beatnik metal sculpturist who agrees to let the Iron Giant hide out  in his scrap yard temporarily.  The Iron Giant is an incredibly sweet movie  with genuine heart-wrenching moments. Drawn in a style that is sort of a  cross between Hank Ketchum (Dennis the Menace)and early Warner Classics,  it's clean lines and rapid-fire humor make for a movie that is equally  enjoyable to both kids and the adults that sit and watch with them.

I'll TELL you how it can -- it can be a wonderful film  with a real heart that looks at a serious subject and considers it in a  thoughtful and even-handed manner.  It can present a leading character who  is thoroughly ""human"" -- despite being about as non-human as you  can get. It can be a film set in a period of paranoia and suspicion that  was still a simpler and quieter time, and it can perfectly capture that  time. It can have scary moments and funny moments and moments of pathos and  of love and warmth. It can have a genuinely despicable villain -- and an  Army General who's rational, level-headed and actually thinks before he  shoots. It can work on several levels for adults, young adults and kids all  at once. It can pay tribute to the wonderful cheesy films we all loved in  the Fifties (especially the original ""Invaders from Mars"" and  ""The Day the Earth Stood Full"").
And it can ask -- and answer  -- the question -- ""What if a gun had a soul?  What if a gun didn't  HAVE to be a gun?""

First of all, the movie has a script that can be adressed to multiple viewers and that makes you laugh, think and cry at the same time (Disney, please learn). If you look at it closer, there aren't any comic relief characters that force you  to laugh. Every character has their own importance. Other acheivement is  that the cold war references do not get in the way of the fun and awe  involved here. The Iron Giant is a character as pure and inocent as Bambi,  but yet its strikes us with his self-restricted powerfulness. The voices  and animation are awesome, and Jennifer Aniston should get an Academy Award  just for developing this ""mother"" character that's so different  from her usual acting. Moreover, the voice casting in general is superb.  Maybe the best thing about this movie is that you don't need any song to  emphasize the script and that you don't have to stand a cheesy or tongue in  cheek ending that seems out of place or that implies a second part as a  must.

Which, now that I think about it, encompasses the whole experience of  anything viewed in a theatre or on a television, so I guess I do have  something against it.  I'm sure that the fans of it all have great reasons  for watching it, and they all obviously love it to bits... but personally,  I can't stand it.
Not that American animation's any better.  For this  reason, I've turned into one of *those* fans of animation - the type that's  dissatisfied with everything he sees.
I don't have to be dissatisfied any  more.  I have seen the future of animation, and its name is The Iron  Giant.
Let's ignore the lack of sidekicks and musical numbers for the  moment, and judge this not as an animated movie, but as a movie in and of  itself - it still rises head and shoulders above almost everything else in  its path, like the 50-foot behemoth the movie's named after.  Every single  frame of film has been put together with the most meticulous of skill and  detail, every single snippet of dialouge is perfectly suited to the  situation and character, and every joke, every plot twist, every event  grows organically out of the premise.
The character of the Giant himself  is the direction I'd like computer animation to go.  The smoothness and  clarity of CGI combined with the warmth and simplicity of hand-drawn  animation.  The most remarkable thing about the Giant, however, is that  even with a thimble for a head and steel shutters for eyes, he's still more  expressive than almost any Japanese character I've ever seen.  For this  alone, Iron Giant gets my vote as a landmark in animation - a movie  everyone will enjoy, and a technical achievment any animator, from ANY  country, could learn a thing or two from.",949276800,10,1867,4.66358024691358

Then one  good review after another appeared for ""The Iron Giant"" and I  decided to give it a shot. What an incredible surprise!  I was entertained  from beginning to the end, and I cared about these characters. I thought  the animation was extremely well done. And the film wasn't finished in its  surprises. It has an important message to kids about guns and killing. I  felt that the message is delivered in a simple and effective way. And it  comes at the right time, with all of the school massacres that dominated  the news all year.

I must comment on the incredible attention paid to detail, from Hogarth's chipped front incisor to the  G.I.'s  slack jaws held perpetually agape at the sight of the Giant.  The  voice-acting is no less superb.  Who could not love Kent Mansley's  condescending, ""Mmm boy!"" when Hogarth insists his family is  eating dinner, or his obnoxious, yet enjoyable quips about the town's  homecoming queen, or his sidesplitting referral to the Giant as, ""...a  dandy! "". The voice-actors inflection, timing, and intonations are  absolutely superb, and I love every character, and would not be happy if  they were destroyed. (I know that sounds sick, but in some productions,  there are just those insipid characters who would not generate so much as a  flinch if they were hit by a Mac truck.)  Thus, if a production is filled  to the brim with indespensable characters, you've done a marvelous job!
I  watch animation all the time, mostly Japanese, since most American stuff is  rubbish.  Even my toddler prefers Japanese.  However, The Iron Giant is  right up there with Japanese quality because rather than relying on  computer animation as Disney and Dreamworks mostly does, it radiates  elegance, unsurpassed facial expression and body movement, and a happy  lacking of archetypical doofus sidekicks who could have jumped out of a Tex  Avery cartoon (shudder).
I also must point out this movie is also lacking  in the seemingly requisite big-name-singer-theme-song department.  No Elton  John or Mariah Carey here, just suitable instrumentals and enlivening  period ""rock"" music.
I shed tears at the end of this movie, and  am genuinely touched by the endearing moments that are so honestly human in  their nuance, simplicity, and tangible ordinarianess.  I will always hold  close to my heart the Giant, with his fists on his hips, chest  ""puffed"" out saying, ""I'm Superman,"" while a scrap-yard  ""S"" hangs from his chest.  Only a slab of asphalt could not be  touched by that.
The team who created The Iron Gian did a truly  commendable job, and considering my viewing fodder is usually such things  as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Hayao Miyazaki films, that is a real  compliment (if I do say so myself).  This movie is so seamless,  well-designed, and perfect that it strikes me as a work of love.  I'm  serious.  WB had better get its act together and consistently produce such  quality films, or I will will lose all hope for American animation.  Disney  formulas and Dreamworks one-liner-scripts just aren't going to cut it.  This is one of the very best movies I have ever seen, hands down.",946425600,24,2702,4.937360178970917

It's just about 10 times better than Disneys  Tarzan, even though it didn't make 1/5th of what Tarzan made. It's just the  Disney name that keeps them alive. Look out Disney, the Iron Giant is  leading the way for a whole new line of Animated movie masterpeices. This  is one of the best ""American"" animated films of all time, but not  generally one of the best animated movies of all time, no way. When it  comes to animation, there's no competition between Japanemation/Anime and  American Cartoons. In Japan there making a full length 3d animated  movie(like toy story) based on the FINAL FANTASY games. Right now, they're  making about 10 seconds of it a week. It's going to be the first of it's  kind. But not only in 3d animation but in all aspects of animation, Japan  rules. Sure this is a great animated film, but it just can't compare to  Japanimation/Anime in particular. I mean this is still a kids movie, just  like all the other American animation. Sure some cartoons like Spawn are  breaking the limits of Western animation making SERIOUS cartoons, but it's  pretty much garbage, again, it just can't compare to the realism of Anime.  If you wanna watch some good Anime movies than I reccommend the  following:
-Grave of the Fireflies(Tragic, made me cry) -A Wind Named  Amnesia -Ninja Scroll -Ghost in the Shell -Macross Plus -Judge -The Dragon  Ball series
Just try some of them out.

The video quality is superb.  The image  is sharp and the colors are true.  This is especially appreciated when  viewing some of the more spectacular animated sequences, such as the storm  at sea at the very beginning of the film, or the combat scenes near the  end.  Contrary to the reviewer who said the sound is inadequate, the  package states that the movie is recorded in Dolby Digital Surround 5.1,  and my player also stated that it was playing AC-3 sound when queried.  My  ears heard sound from all six speakers, and the sound is very nicely done.  There are many quiet scenes in the story, but when full blown sound is  called for, it is there.  There are not a lot of extras on this disk, but  it is better supplied than most family films.  For some reason, the studios  have decided that those who buy family oriented movies are not interested  in the additional features that other DVDs provide.  This disk does include  a trailer (see for yourself if Warner botched the advertising for this film  or just released it at a bad time), bios and filmographies of the cast, and  a -Making of- documentary.  The latter was apparently made for television  and shown prior to the release of the movie to build interest.  It contains  clips of interviews with the cast and director and not much else.  There is  really little about the actual production of the movie.  The disk also  contains some DVD-ROM material but this is also rather limited.  Please  note that I don't consider interactive menus and scene access to be special  features, they are, or should be, standard features of all DVDs.  All  though these extras are limited, they are far more than commonly found on  DVDs intended for a comparible market.  The only really negative thing I  can offer about the DVD version of The Iron Giant is that it is packaged in  the cheap and shabby cardboard Snap case that Warner insists on using.

Could not help noticing that every 5th or 6th of them mentions Disney products as something very different from the Warners masterpiece.  But Warners is taking it's first  steps in full-length animation and of course quite eager to make a name for  itself at the market. Do you seriously expect them to duplicate the Disney  formula of incessantly singing heroes/heroines traveling exotic landscapes  in a company of mischeviously giggling sidekicks? Of course the first  releases of the major studio have to be innovative. Warner is ready to earn  less but make it's presense felt in the market, to back up it's ambitions  with something worth mentioning. So the superbly creative team got the  adequate funding and now we have this rare gem. I suppose that was the case  in Disney's early years but now it's mostly routine and marketing overkill.
A lot of reviewers mention the Cold War relics making the film ring true  but I see another All-American tradition behind the plot. Remember Shane?  Yes,yes,yes! Retired gunfighter befriending a boy. It's a Western in all  it's archetypal splendor! In which inter-galactical battles the big guy  took his deadly part part? Who knows? He came out of nowhere.  -"" You  are not a gun!"" - But when the baddies close in he is spitting fire -  and what the difference if it's space blasters that make enemy run for  cover - not the six-guns of the great tradition? The Iron Giant is  laconical, galant with the ladies and children - he is a bit of a child  himself. He is rushing unflinchingly towards his destiny to save the loved  ones. Do you need more similarities?
As for the quality of animation it  made me happy every time I saw The Giant move with such UNPREDICTABLE ease.  When you see the great chunk of metal you expect him to creak and limp but  what really happens takes your breath away.
Characterization is above  all praise. The people are really alive! Neurotic beatnik yearning for the  contact with fellow humans, owerworked single mother - and the boy! Every  one of them is worthy of Oscar nomination. They look more real and  endearing than the majority of Hollywood's flesh and blood progeny.
The  movie got the highest rating from my 7-year old son. -"" It's like  Wallace & Gromit."" - Meaning it's real art and the DVD has to be  bought in the next few days.",944524800,20,2372,4.670702179176756
1252500,5,B000028U3R,"This is a movie for all to enjoy. Kids, parents, and animation buffs of all ages will be impressed by this masterpiece. Some parents might be wondering about the PG rating -- it means just that; the parents should see  it with their kids, but they don't really have to unless they are terribly  sensitive towards certain subjects.  Some parents might object to having  their children hear about death (""It's bad to kill, but it's not bad  to die, it's part of life"" explains Hogarth, the boy, to the Giant)  and such. But this is a far better movie in content and design than  anything Disney has produced in the last several years, perhaps the decade.  The animation is a lot of CG (the Giant is pure CG, believe it or not)  disguised as old fashioned cell animation, and it looks spectacular. All of  the characters were well done. 1)Hogarth, the boy, was actually pretty  cool, never annoying. 2)The Giant was amazing animationwise and as a  character, he is NOT a big dumb hulking mass. 3)The villain was creatively  done and quite deceptive.  And it is a breath of fresh air to have a (very,  very) funny kids movie WITHOUT forced, saccharin-happy, sing-song scenes or  completely lame comic relief ""sidekicks"". As for the violent  scenes, Tarzan, Mulan, heck even the Little Mermaid, were worse. If  anything, the superior animation might make the violence more impressive  looking in ""Giant"". The only thing that could be classified as  gore or maiming was a bloody nose Hogarth got when he ran into a tree. Oh,  and somebody shoots a deer (offscreen). As for objectionable language,  Hogarth says ""Oh my God"" and the villain and a military General  say ""hell"". As for the dramatic scenes, they were impeccably  done. The characters displayed emotions that were convincing (even- nay  -especially the Giant) Nothing felt artificial, nothing made me gag. The  ending made my eyes water, my girlfriend cried, and my cynical, sourpuss  brother whispered ""wow!"".",944524800,44,1965,4.875757575757576

The boy  befriends the giant ironman after saving it from being electrocuted  (it  tried eating the town's powerstation). The giant's intentions are peaceful  but the boy keeps the giant away from the townspeople because he fears they  will think that it's a secret weapon from Russia. The director, Brad Bird,  has created a film that captures the paranoia that was sweeping our country  at that time. The giant is a loveable misfit who cannot understand human  nature.

1252505,5,B000028U3R,"Iron Giant is possibly the single most misunderstood and poorly marketed animated film in HISTORY.  People who went to see The Iron Giant (almost totally by accident thanks to Warner Bros. poorly conceived add campaign)  were treated to breathtaking animation, a powerful story, and humor that  was truly funny.  It is a film so expertly crafted that you frequently  forgot that it was even animated.  Warner Brothers begged us on TV and  radio to give up seven dollars at the box office to see some lanky kid and  his pal - the 50 metal giant.  What they meant to say was come see a timely  story about a bright young mind growing up in a world filled with cold war  fear and pessimism who learns that hope for peace and the future comes from  understanding those around you and making them understand the value of  their own lives and that of those close to them as well.
What made The  Iron Giant so particularly engrossing was the fact that it merely used  animation as a medium to tell a story.  It wasn't dependant on an endless  string of sight gags and funny characters.  Animation here is the context  and not the content of our story.  In this the Iron Giant was exceedingly  successful.  It tells a story about a boy who overcomes his fear about  life, the world and those around him to befriend a being catastrophically  different from himself - a being fifty feet tall and made entirely out of  metal. Set in the late  1950's, The Iron Giant opens just as Sputnik takes  flight over a frightened United States  and Americans begin to look skyward  in fear.  Just then, a 50-foot visitor from another world drops in  uninvited and is discovered by a small boy who saves its life.  Soon  after, the boy befriends the giant despite its unusual size.  This  friendship teaches the boy how to understand and live with others equally  different - though not in such obvious ways.  His adoption of the local  beatnik as a surrogate big brother is perhaps the true connection story in  this film.  Together they must try to convince the government and an  increasingly paranoid small town that the 50-foot visitor from another  planet isn't the threat that it seems to be.  But with America feeling the  treat from Russia by way of Sputnik overhead and the new terror of nuclear  annihilation from distant ICBM's this will be no easy task.
In the end we  see a story that captures what many of us felt growing up in the 70's and  what our parents felt through the 50's and 60's.  The characters here, as  did each of us, must find hope for the future in their own, personal ways.  The threat, we find, comes not from forces apart from our nation but from  within ourselves in the form of our own fear and paranoia.  All this is  beautifully realized with animation clear, fluid and dynamic and a script  that would have played just as well in live action. The voice talents of  Jennifer Anniston and Harry Connick Jr were well chosen and only add to  these character's breadth and veracity. And while the film seemed to be  frightening to smaller children, I still feel that is an important film for  children to see. The final film provides laughs, tears and fears and more  than being a film we would all WANT to see I believe that it is a film that  we all NEED to see. Far from being just family entertainment, it is a film  that completely engrosses the entire family.",944352000,12,3378,4.511627906976744

The story is wonderfully written with plenty  of action, humor and heartbreak. (Yes, I was crying like a little girly-man  at the end, too.) Don't let all the E.T. comparisons distract you, this  story was written a good twelve years before Spielberg's film. Its  refreshing to see an animated film without any silly musical numbers and  annoying sidekicks voiced by the comedic flavor-of-the-month. This film  should be rewarded for treating kids with respect and not pandering to them  like a certain special effects blockbuster of this past summer. (HINT:out  of place doo-doo jokes in a Galaxy far, far away...)
 The animation is  simply superb. It harkens back to the great early Disney cartoons of the  40s and 50s. (Which makes sense since Iron Giant is set in 1957.) Two  veteren Disney animators even make cameos as the train conductors. The  robot was beautifully designed and rendered by these very talented artists.
 The voice-over actors were all outstanding. Eli Marienthal played  little Hogarth Hughes with the right amount of spunk and intelligence.  Harry Connick Jr. was one cool beatnik, Daddy-o and Jennifer Aniston was  wonderful as the young caring mother. The supporting cast was also great,  but what would you expect from the likes of M. Emmet Walsh and John  Mahoney?
 The Iron Giant was another in a long line of great overlooked  films in 1999. (Rushmore, Election, The Limey, The Straight Story, Three  Kings .) Poor marketing by Warner Bros. and an already over- crowded summer  movie schedule killed this film at the box-office.

This was quite a schock to most of the kids in the theatre.  Despite this,  The Iron Giant has a great message about passivisim and  non-violence that is particularly relevant given the vast amount of  inappropriately violent forms of media available to them today.

It both pokes fun at and  sympathises with the fears and prejudices of adults with equal care,  demonstrating a lesson without demonizing anyone. As someone who writes and  produces feature films, I am quite jaded, and usually leave a theatre  fealing empty and critical.

It's not as if any non-Disney animation ever makes a lot of noise or money at the box office, so when I missed my chance to see The Iron Giant at the  theatre, I really kicked myself for an unexcusable complacency.  I still  have not seen The Prince of Egypt (another one I shouldn't have missed),  but seeing the Iron Giant for the first time on video struck me with the  same awe and admiration as when I saw Anastasia for the first time.  The  animation boasts some good quality work for a non-Japanese animated  feature.  If you have seen Anastasia, then you have no doubt noticed the  attention to detail.  But in the Iron Giant it is not the detail that is so  powerful, it is the attention to the subtle movements and the tender story  that unfolds between Hogarth and the Giant.  There is plenty of what I'd  call The Charlotte's Web element in this movie.  The viewing of the world  thorough the eyes of a child.  The simple truths and uncorrupted morals of  'guns kill' and 'be who you choose to be' are touchingly brought up and  presented to the viewer without making everything overdramatic.  Additionally, the cold war mentalities, fears, paranoias, school drills,  and such are quite effectively presented and yet in the midst of all of  these mature topics, you'll find yourself rolling with laughter during some  very funny sequences.  And not only will the story's elements of friendship  and sacrifice remind you of a classic feature like Charlotte's Web, there  are awesome action sequences that really push the excitement level several  notches.  This movie has it all; good lessons and morals for the kids and  good quality animation and production for the adults.  You will be  entertained every time you watch this, so my advice would be for you not  only to watch it at least once, but to buy it and enjoy it again and again.

Both the 3-D compuater  animation and the traditiona 2-D artworks were outstanding and brilliant.  Most importantly, ""The Iron Giant"" has a very touching story. You  would have the sympathy for the ""big metal guy"", but you will  also laugh at some plots. ""The Iron Giant"" is the best animation  of the year undoubtfully, and I recommend it with enthusiasm.",943315200,32,656,4.743362831858407
1252549,5,B000028U3R,"What can I say? This movie has a lot going for it - decent story, good characters, clever use of CG (the comic books and the Giant, for the most part). Overall - at least rent this movie, since it is very well done.",943315200,,215,3.909090909090909
1252550,4,B000028U3R,"I thought this movie was excellent for ages 3 on up.  There was no violence or questionable language.  My 5 year old son fell in love with it, and I just couldn't wait until it came out on video.  I recommend it over a  lot of the recent Disney movies.",942969600,38,252,3.98
1252551,5,B000028U3R,"Everyone who has seen The Iron Giant loves it. That's a given. But the point I want to make is that perhaps FINALLY people will take animated films seriously, not just as a baby-sitter for the little ones. Sure, some  cartoons are made just for kids. (And some are for adults only, for that  matter.) But The Iron Giant is a truly great film. Period. It isn't a  ""kiddie cartoon"" or a movie that's ""great for kids.""  It's just a great movie. If people would stop treating cartoons and comic  books as kid stuff and open their eyes to terrific productions like this,  they would find out they've been missing a lot. I just finished producing a  cartoon myself and while the audience is children I didn't ""dumb it  down"" for them. Adults enjoy it as much as anybody. Do yourself a  favor. Buy this video. See The Iron Giant. It will make you laugh, cry, and  love the people you're with. It may also change your opinion of animation  all together.",942537600,20,945,4.436046511627907
1252552,5,B000028U3R,"I watched this movie 4 times in the theater and found new subtleties every time.  It is an extremely well-made movie, with a message.  Everything happens for a reason, not simply to manipulate.
  This movie  contains cliches that I've met upon in quite a few movies, but it allowed  me to discover why they are used in so many movies.  It felt like they were  all made new again.
  By the way, this movie swept the Annie  (animation) awards which put it up against Tarzan, Prince of Egypt, A Bug's  Life, and Antz.  Don't make a mistake by not renting or buying this movie.",942364800,4,573,4.394230769230769
1252573,5,B000028U3R,"This movie absolutely exceeded every expectation I had for it.  It is a wonderful and beautiful expression of all the parts transcending the art form.  A truly touching and moving story, likeable and believable characters, and GREAT animation - from the seamlessly intergrated CG Giant  to the expressive and dynamic pen & ink characters.  I've created a  website for the movie with lots of articles, interviews & pictures.  This is a great movie to share with children  and adults, and can be used to open a dialogue about violence, friendship,  souls, death, identity, and most importantly... ""you are who you  choose to be.""  Your fate is not decided by what you are.  Get a copy  for yourself and several for gifts this holiday season.  The Iron Giant  managed to scrape a meager amount at the box office despite WB's inept  marketing (I heard about this movie on the internet through movie sites,  but didn't see a thing in the so-called ""advertising"") and  Director Brad Bird feels like it will find it's true home on video.  You  won't be able to watch it just once.  You won't be able to rent it and not  buy it.  It's thrilling, funny and pulls on just the right heartstrings  without being manipulative and condescending. Kudos to the creators on the  9 Annie (animation) awards and 15 nominations.  Much deserved.  And thank  you.
You'll love this movie!  :-)",942278400,9,1370,4.763948497854077
1252574,5,B000028U3R,"I wanted to see this movie at theaters when it was first released because, it got generally favorable reviews. This movie did not disappoint and is a mix of ""E.T."" and ""I Robot"". Excellent transformation  sequence towards the end which would put ""The Transformers"" to  shame. This should appeal to all ages who are young at heart because, it  appeals to our forgotten childhood innocence.",942192000,,388,4.938461538461539
1252575,5,B000028U3R,"Warner Brother's execs should be hanging their heads in shame after the pitiful marketing they provided this absolutely excellent film.  The script is sharp, working on so many different levels that I can't imagine someone  leaving the theater not satisfied.  The animation varies from subtle to  stunning and Michael Kamen's score is a perfect accompaniment to the  visuals.  Do yourself a favor: Look at the number of stars everyone's given  this film and just BUY IT.  Support this great work to make up for the  stupidity of Warner Brother's marketing.",941932800,,556,5.088888888888889

This is honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen. As all of the other reviews mention,  there are no gimmicks, no songs, etc.... just a great entertaining movie.  This is not just a great movie for kids, it is for all ages. For those of  you that have seen the movie, you'll know why my son's face lights up  everytime we drive past a power station. He wants to make sure he doesn't  miss seeing the Giant in case he needs some more help. At least he hasn't  asked us to change his name to Hogarth.....yet!",941846400,,638,4.064
1252577,5,B000028U3R,"Brad Bird has created a film that makes you feel good to be alive.  This is why people tell stories, and more importantly, why people want to see and hear stories being told.  Witty, charming, funny and heartwarming, The  Iron Giant is a moral story in the best sense of the word.  It is a story  of honesty, courage and redemption.  And more importantly than that, it's  one heck of a fun movie.  This movie speaks to you at your level--kids will  love it and adults will love it for some of the same and some completely  different reasons.  I cannot adequately describe the joy that this movie  filled me with.  I am not generally an animation buff--my favorite movies  are the Godfather movies.  And now on that short list of great ones that  I'll never forget is The Iron Giant.  There is only one word that does this  movie justice: Perfection.",941673600,,849,4.473684210526316

The fact that the DVD will also contain  supplementary materials only heightens my anticipation of its release. SEE  IT: TELL YOUR FRIENDS! Let's hope the Academy recognizes come Oscar time.  As an aside, Brad Bird, the director, has just been signed to bring a  live-action Curious George to the screen...EXCELLENT!!!!",941587200,,489,5.0
1252579,5,B000028U3R,"I'd put this movie in with the best of the year so far...  Right up there with American Beauty and The Sixth Sense.  This is not just a kids movie,  as other reviewers have mentioned.  It is easily one of the best animated  movies of all time- while it didn't have the ad push or big-budget effects  Tarzan had, it had something that Tarzan never really was able to show- a  heart.  If you missed this in the theater, try it on video or DVD...  you  won't regret it!",941328000,,466,4.134831460674158

For me, I have not experienced this type of  wonder watching a movie since I was 7 watching Star Wars back in 1977.  See  this movie!!!!",941068800,,386,4.428571428571429
