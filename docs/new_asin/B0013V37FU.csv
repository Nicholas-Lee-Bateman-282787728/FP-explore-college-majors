It was difficult to focus on the first segment because it primarily has a series of bells, which were a bit distracting for me.  The second segment was much better for me.  In thsi second segment, there are some very soothing vocals and some really relaxing music.  I actually play it in the house when I am cooking and doing other things.",1384819200,,466,4.488095238095238
