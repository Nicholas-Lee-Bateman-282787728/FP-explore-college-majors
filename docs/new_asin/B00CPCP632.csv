8676287,5,B00CPCP632,"A friend of mine actually recommended this book after he had read it. I decided to give it a shot since he liked it so much and I'm kind of a fitness fanatic! I must say I started and finished reading it the same day. Great book packed with a lot of information. It's not your boring old yoga book it is pretty entertaining. I definitely recommend it to everyone that comes across this, it is totally worth it!",1372896000,,410,4.2025316455696204
