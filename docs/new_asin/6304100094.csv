I didn't expect to be swept off my feet by one of the most  bittersweet dramas I've ever seen!  My husband and I saw the film in the  theater and there wasn't a dry eye in the house.  The heartwrenching  aspects of the film are balanced by Bronson Pinchot's wonderful comic  relief.  And of course Olivia shines.

Admittedly the film has lost a lot of its poignancy, after all HIV/AIDS is not the death sentence it once was, and some of the early 90s pop culture references make the film seem a bit dated.

What an amazing movie......I was just taken away by all the stars in this movie, all who did an outstanding job....how did this movie make out then out on DVD so quietly?

782313,1,6304100094,"Actually, it may have done it way before that.  I don't like to give negative reviews but this movie is out of control.  Somebody should have reigned these folks in, or, well, put a stop to it.  Even on paper it just sounds insulting to the gay community and to AIDS victims. See, movies like Longtime Companion and Torch Song Trilogy were great and moving films.  They also worked well because the casts were relatively unknown and were actually ""acting"", - playing roles. To create a big ""party"" of well known B (C or D) performers/actors just makes the entire premise silly and overbearing.

I guess the idea of Marlee Matlin and Margaret Cho came from someone who realized that each gay man has an asian girlfriend and a deaf girlfriend. I guess Cho is a good example of why this whole thing is so over the top. Wouldn't this be the kind of movie Cho would make fun of? She looks like she's phoning it in or just being plain condescending.

Eric Roberts is a very talented actor, really, I think he is, (check out Star 80) but...as a gay man that we are supposed to feel sorry for? He falls into the same trap as many other performances in the movie. It just comes across condescending and kind of... I don't know.... put upon.

More importantly, the story itself kind of backfires on their intentions. A gay man dying of Aids, plans to off himself but throw a party before he does it? And this makes him a....hero? No. It kind of makes him self posessed, self involved and a very confused martyr. The characters in Longtime Companion, for example, were all trying to fight to stay alive for themselves and the people around them.  They were trying to make sense out of a tragedy that they did not deserve.

It just got to be so bad that I thought Olivia Newton John was going to break out into song somewhere in the film.  I wouldn't have been surprised.",1216339200,7,1859,4.425219941348973

782317,5,6304100094,This is the most sadness movie. That's ashame for Brandon being so afraid to be with Nick just because he found out he was HIV+ and Brandon freaked out and Nick had to leave because of Brandon. If I was Brandon I would still love Nick even if he is HIV+ or HIV- I would always be there for Nick. When they threw couple of days farewell party for Nick and Margaret went and found Brandon and forced him to go see Nick before Nick's death and Brandon showed up. All of Nick's friends and family doesnt like Brandon but they gave Brandon a chance to visit Nick because Nick wanted Brandon to be there too. In the end friends had to leave first so Nick should have to have a family-together as what Nick's mother wanted. When friends said good-bye then I started to feel so deep and it made me feel so apart and watering in my eyes. When they had family-together and Brandon started to realized that he still love Nick. Nick took the pills and then he was sitting on the chair talking about the pictures from the photo album and then he dead in peace. This made me feel so sorry for Nick's family and his family cried like hell. I am SO fond of Marlee Matlin because I am also deaf and I know sign language.

Among the partygoers are his estranged parents (Lee Grant and George Segal), former lover (Harrison), and closest friends (Bronson Pinchot, Olivia Newton-John, and Margaret Cho). Like the M*A*S*H finale from 1983, the cast says goodbye about 200 times, most annoyingly while Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" plays over and over. Roberts looks too healthy to be on his deathbed, while Pinchot and Cho fall into stereotypical bitchy charicatures. Lee Grant is splendid, however, and Harrison (surprisingly) gives the film's best performance as the guilty but ultimately worthy ex-boyfriend of Nick who finally makes peace as Nick ends his life.

(USA - 1996)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: DTS

In the last few days before an AIDS-related brain tumor renders him insensible, a young LA designer (Eric Roberts) decides to end his own life, though not before throwing a final joyous bash for family and loved ones. However, the occasion is strained by the arrival of Roberts' former lover (Gregory Harrison), seeking reconciliation at the eleventh hour...

Though heartfelt and moving, Randal Kleiser's powerful film - inspired by actual events - feels a little fragmented and plays like a reunion of his closest showbiz friends (the cast is a veritable who's-who of familiar faces), anchored firmly by Harrison and Roberts in the central roles. Their former relationship is outlined briefly at the start of the film, too briefly for the subsequent break-up to register as anything more than a minor event, though their love for one another is conveyed with real strength and conviction.

Roddy McDowall essays the voice of conscience during a brief cameo appearance in which he questions the ethics of suicide, but his character's conservative views are given short shrift by Kleiser's defiant screenplay, which uses a sprinkling of mordant humor to keep mawkishness at bay (at one point, Roberts and his best friend [Bronson Pinchot, camping it up with abandon] launch into a rousing rendition of ""It's my party/And I'll die if I want to""!). As you might imagine, however, the final twenty minutes are relentlessly, heartbreakingly sad. Amongst the high-profile supporting players, look fast for Nina Foch, Sally Kellerman, Greg Louganis, Steve Antin and a virtually unrecognizable Dennis Christopher and Christopher Atkins.",1079481600,,1707,5.307407407407408

Yes the story is written well. Yes the message is deep. Yes it will make you cry and blah blah blah.
Why do gay films depict the main characters as either drag queens, tramps, or suffering from disease?
Maybe I don't like this film because it was disturbing in the true depiction of what an AIDS victim could possibly face. Or the flashbacks of others that have died in the film. Or the shallow lover that abandons the sick main character. I don't know, it isn't a bad film, it is just horribly depressing and not a film I ever care to watch again.
Why can't the next gay film embrace life, not death. Embrace love, not break-ups. Embrace happiness, not sadness?

782492,4,6304100094,"I came upon this little-known film by accident the other evening and it was a discovery that I was glad to have made. As has previously been stated, Eric Roberts portrays ""Nick"" who has been living an idyllic existence with his partner ""Brandon,"" portrayed by Gregory Harrison. Suddenly, their lives are turned inside out when Nick is diagnosed with AIDS. Brandon is unable to cope with the revelation and begins to distance himself from his friend. The strain on the relationship caused them to have a permanent and ugly separation.

One year later, as the disease begins to progress to its eventual fatal end, Nick decides to throw a ""bash"" for his himself, as well as his family and friends. Nick also intends on taking his own life because prior to his mind and body's deterioration.

Nick's family and friends all come with the exception of the unknowing Brandon. Margaret Cho, playing one of Nick's friends, intercedes and seeks out Brandon, telling him about his former lover's intentions. During the party, Brandon appears and amidst the celebration, he and Nick briefly reconcile.

The final meeting between the two is poignant as well as celebratory.

As far as the performances are concerned, the principals are superb. Why Roberts did not attain the heights, as his better-known sibling, Julia, is unfathomable. He is quite good as the dying Nick.

Harrison is appropriately confused and compassionate as one that must deal with his own guilt and the mortality of someone with whom he had planned to share his life.

Lee Grant, as Nick's mom, is brilliant, showing why she has been one of the most unappreciated actresses of the past fifty years.

With a supporting cast of Bronson Pinchot, George Segal, Bruce Davison, Marlee Matlin, Olivia Newton-John (who supplies the song heard over the closing credits), Roddy McDowall (in one of his last roles), and a cameo appearance by acting legend Nina Foch (as Brandon's mother), the film has the clout to be one of the best ensemble cast in recent years.

It's too bad that this well-made film came and went with little fanfare and seems now relegated to late night on cable television.

The film is powerful and deserving of wider viewership.",1075248000,35,2202,4.913746630727763

It has been several years since I saw ""It's My Party"", yet I shudder at the thought of sitting through it again merely to refresh a distasteful memory.  So relying on somewhat faded impressions to guide me, I'll add my voice to the small but sensible chorus of amateur reviewers who warn you away from this ghastly movie.
Tragedy may inspire great art, but distance from the tragedy is necessary.  Without such perspective the resulting work of art, no matter how deeply felt by the artist, may seem as trite as a 12-year-old's diary.
""It's My Party"" is a diary-entry film.  It's about a gay man with an AIDS-related condition who knows he has only a few days before his mind succumbs to dementia.  He therefore throws himself a farewell/suicide party.  The attendees include an ex-lover, family members, and friends both gay and straight.  Sharp-tongued Charlene (the comedienne Margaret Cho) is among the latter, but if you expect laughs from Cho or anyone else, you're in for disappointment.
In fact, given the comic caliber of many in the large cast (which includes Lee Grant, George Segal, and Bronson Pinchot), the resulting glum-fest seems intentionally perverse.  Humor is desperately needed, but this film is too bland and politically correct to criticize the hero's -- or anyone else's -- solemn self-involvement.  It's all terribly earnest and terribly treacly.  Perhaps if it had been about another disease, it wouldn't have felt so condescending.  As it stands, it's a movie that makes one want to take a hot shower when it's over.
One can wistfully imagine what a more accomplished writer and director would have done with this premise.  The fact that this film has found an appreciative audience points to how ""gay cinema"" needs to grow up.  That day will have arrived when gay films are judged by the same criteria as mainstream films, and films like ""It's My Party"" are, like its hero, quietly euthanized.",1066089600,5,1924,4.904320987654321

Everyone did such an excellant job in the movie but i think the standouts were eric roberts as nick, greg harrison as nick's ex, marlee matlin as nicks sister, lee grant as nicks mother, and margaret cho and olivia newton john as some of nicks best friends. this movie will make you laugh and make you cry. every time i watch this movie i cry. I wish i couldve seen it in the theatres. also one of my favorite soundtracks with a beautiful score by basil poladeuris. and olivia newtons song don't cut me down at the end. i agree with another reviewer when you see the opening scene after watching it a second time you tear up already!

The interactions between the characters range from humorous to painful with each actor giving his all to portray the characters in a realistic light. In many cases, the characters make peace with each other which will definitely leave you reaching for the Kleenex box.
I would highly recommend this film! It is not only a great piece of film, but it also makes you think not only about how fragile life is, but that we should all live life to the fullest and make ourselves happy - a important theory indeed.",1052956800,,785,4.458333333333333

782582,5,6304100094,"I bought this film on VHS, widescreen, a few years ago, because I am somewhat of an AIDS activist and was impressed with the cast. After watching it the first time, I thought it was a bit too sentimental and tear-jerking. I've watched it since, and am amazed at what I missed the first time. First off, Eric Roberts (known for being nuts a lot) gives a admirably controlled performance, belying his reputation. He is truly wonderful; centered and sensitive. Every nuance is remarkable! I am so impressed. I've done some research, and found that Randal Kleiser put himself in the character of Brandon (Gregory Harrison), maybe to redeem his guilt trip. He'd apparently taken 10 years to put this film together, and found an outstanding, stellar cast; he should be given credit for talent and integrity. The gay community lambasted this film initially because of the stereotypes, but, hey, I thought this was a composite of life as it is...straight or gay...they were all there; the only unbelievable thing to me was that Nik called all his friends and they showed up. (This would never happen with me). One of the most amazing facets of the film was the editing of Ila von Hasperic, not only for the flashbacks, but the incredible group scenes, dialogue, scene shifts, etc. Most impressive! I think that if the ending wasn't so predictable, this is a film Altman would love to make. The ensemble cast was used to great advantage. There are terrific performances from Margaret Cho, Lee Grant, Bronson Pinchot (the snot you love to hate), Roddy MacDowall, Marlee Matlin and Olivia Newton-John (who Kleiser used to good advantage in ""Grease""). Some fine moments to be aware of: Brandon turns on his TV and he's watching ""Night of the Hunter"", the scene where Shelley Winters' body is at the bottom of the river...suddenly he's with her, alone, looking for Nik. (""Night of the Hunter"" is also the only film directed by Charles Laughton, thought a failure in its initial release). This is disturbing to me, because it suggests that suicide is OK. Under these circumstances, I'm not sure. It's a very unpleasant but positive argument. Olivia's final song (over closing credits) ""Don't Cut Me Down"" pretty much tells it all. This film is so full of great moments, and it gets very weepy throughout, but Kleiser has put together a narrative that is important now as much as in 1996. There's also ""bite your tongue"" humor, and sweetness. The absolute bottom line is that Eric Roberts knows how to keep his mouth shut. It's during these moments...his reactions...a simple phrase...makes me want to see him in other roles than those he's known for. I could see him doing Crowe's role in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Is that over the edge? See this film, and you might agree. He's never shown such control.",1025308800,3,2784,4.81419624217119
782583,4,6304100094,"So you thought Julia Roberts had all the talent in the family?  Think again, and see ""It's My Party"" if you want proof positive that Eric, her brother, deserves the same level of praise and attention.  A shattering performance that was grossly overlooked in 1996, Roberts plays the central character, dying from AIDS with dignity and self-determination that is so rarely captured ANYWHERE it's often astounding to the viewer to get through.  If you thought ""Terms of Endearment"" was a terrific film, you might dislike the honesty and wrenching sincerity of this movie.  There is little room for self-disdain here, or sadness.  Rather, what erupts throughout is pure emotional awareness....Roberts captures so many dimensions of a dying man, you're celebrating AND reflecting at once.  There is also an incredible supporting cast and special kudos to Harrison, Newton-John, and Cho.  A real family film - see it and share it with the people you love.  A note to the studio - how about a DVD release with some behind-the-scenes extras and perhaps even some reflections from the lovely Julia Roberts on her brother's extraordinary turn",1010707200,4,1132,5.114130434782608
782584,4,6304100094,"This is a very unconventional movie.  I hadn't heard anything about it when it was released.  You'd think that since one of the main topics is impending death, the whole movie would be pretty morbid.  In fact, although there is a definite underlying sadness throughout the whole movie, one has to admire Nick (the main character) for his upbeat attitude.  I don't want to give too much away, as it would ruin the effect of the movie.  My friend who watched it with me mentioned that it had an ""indie"" feel to it.  Definitely not the normal gloss and correctness of mainstream Hollywood.  I'd definitely see it again.",1007683200,,616,4.648148148148148

It doesn't have that happy-go-lucky-feel-good quota that Hollywood must churn out to make the masses happy. This film is about AIDS and how one man decides to end his life. The idea of a dying man having all his friends over for a last party before he swallows a handfull of pills is not exactly gonna do Harry Potter box office now is it? The person to watch here is Eric Roberts, the creepy brother of Julia, who turns in THE performance of his career. He saves this movie from some crap dialog and preposterous situations. Margaret Cho, Marlee Matlin and the criminally underrated Lee Grant (as Eric Roberts devastated, chain smoking mother) all give solid support. This is not for everyone, but it is rewarding and brave.",1006128000,,866,4.593548387096774

782587,3,6304100094,"The film is a sad sort of ""farewell party"" for the character played by Eric Roberts. Roberts is gay and has had AIDS for a number of years when he is told that he really only has a number of days to live a normal life because his brain is being ""overtaken"" by symptoms of the disease. He decides that he, like friends before him, will commit suicide to avoid the pain and distress of suffering that he might otherwise face and put his family through. He puts together a farewell party and invites all his friends and family, except for one... his longtime partner-whose name is Brandon, I think (with whom he had broken up a year earlier when the lover could not handle his disease). The premise of the film is interesting and some of the moments in the film are quite poignant and thought provoking, but the cast is really too large to create any real intimacy. When one of the friends (played by comedian Margaret Cho) decides to tell Brandon herself that there are only a number of days left, Brandon shows up at the party. Eventually, after several days, Brandon and Eric Roberts's character reconcile. Overall there are just too many characters and things going on to focus well enough. (Also stars Marlee Matlin as Eric Roberts's sister, George Segal as his estranger father, Bronson Pinchot as one of his many friends, Olivia Newton John and Bruce Davison as more of his friends... and the list goes on and on...) Overall not a movie to watch if you are depressed, but it is a decent film with some rather heartwrenching scenes and issues. (When Eric Roberts and Brandon are initially breaking up and Roberts is leaving the house they have shared together throughout their relationship, Roberts breaks into tears and asks Brandon, ""Can I come back here to die?"" Things like that are difficult to deal with without having a tear or two fall).",1001548800,2,1848,4.620060790273556

That said, if you are a romantic at heart, you will ultimately be caught up in the sentiment of this piece. Yes, you might even get a lump in your throat...however, the same one you got the last time you watched ""Dark Victory"".

782699,4,6304100094,"I really can't see this twice because its just so sad. There were too many people in this movie, but the main characters truly were terrific in their roles. Eric Roberts is Nick Stark, an artist/architect and a proud gay man. He has been living with his lover(Gregory Harrison) Brandon for several years and they have been together for 8 years. Brandon is a tv/movie director and the two are the opposites of each other. When Nick finds out that he has been tested positive Brandon promises that he won't leave his side yet he is afraid of Nick now. Nick gets hurt when Brandon starts to pull away and finally they break up and Nick is hurt, whilst Brandon moves on with Zack..a young man. 1 year later Nick gets tested positive for PLM or...something meaning he has only a few days before his brain stops functioning properly so therefore he decides to end his life, but before doing so he wants to hold a party for his friends and family. This was truly a sad film to watch and it really sticks to your mind after youve seen it. I'm still thinking about it and I can't get over the fact that my favourite actor Gregory Harrison actually kissed another man...but they were both wonderful in this movie, but I didn't understand the way Nick was so calm about dying.",998092800,10,1265,4.456896551724138

782701,3,6304100094,"Regretfully, I had to watch this film over three sittings, so I suspect that its emotional impact was diminished.
With the cover screaming  ""ensemble"", it becomes difficult to keep track of all the  different characters, and more importantly, how each of them is connected  to the central character, Nick Stark (the name of a romance hero if I ever  saw one). Usually, the joy of an ensemble cast is watching the medley of  actors interacting with each other. This works about half the time in this  movie. Many of the actors give heartfelt performances, but . . .
The  script fails to make many of the excess of characters interesting.  Ultimately, it is the story of the returned lover, and his attempts to  reconnect with his dying partner, the provide the meat of the movie, and  all the rest is dressing. For the most part, all of the rest of the  characters aren't given any depth until they walk out the door.
It's  clear that this was a meaningful project for many of the people involved,  and it is touching in its goofy, way. At times, it's a peaceful, story,  attempting to give grace to a suicide, at other times, bludgeoning the  viewer with its overlapping lines. Yes. He had a life. He had family. He  had friends. They're sad to see him go. We get it.
But we do. This is  the ultimate 3-star movie. Neither good nor bad. I think it obviously has  some positive role in our universe, it exists for some reason. It just  didn't make that connection with me.",966297600,3,1471,4.503787878787879
