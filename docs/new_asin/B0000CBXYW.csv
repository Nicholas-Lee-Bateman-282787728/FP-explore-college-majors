7998693,3,B0000CBXYW,"Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, is best known for her unaccompanied junket to the Holy Land, when she was about 76-80 years old. While there, she acquired what were represented to be relics of Christ's life, crucifixion, and resurrection (pieces of the True Cross, nails therefrom, etc.), which she dutifully sent back to Europe and Constantinople. Like modern day pilgrims to the Holy Land, she delighted in souvenirs. The fact that the Roman Army leveled Jerusalem in the Jewish War of 69 AD, thus making relics difficult to find, seems to have had little impact upon her credulity or that of the Readers Digest, which produced this film.

Technically, the video is beautifully produced, and provides a nice tour of the Holy Land and some of its major sights, although the PBS ones are preferable.
