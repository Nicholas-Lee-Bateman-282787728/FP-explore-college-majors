3092003,3,B0012KZM8M,"You really have to hand it to the Jim Henson Company for showing incredible adaptability throughout the years.  From legendary beginnings in the realm of puppets, it seems only natural for the company to be making use of the current red-hot trend of computer generated animated feature films.  While the big boys like Disney/ Pixar and DreamWorks have proven just how incredible this medium can actually be.  The Henson Group (wisely) isn't attempting to go toe-to-toe with these juggernauts, but rather entertain audiences of all ages with a direct-to-DVD series they call the Unstable Fables- which essentially spoof classic fairy tales with contemporary references.

Yes this is the formula we've witnessed countless times in the past (Shrek, Hoodwinked, Happily Never After) but the Unstable Fables really capitalizes on the concept by combining just enough of the original fairy tale to retain the names and locations with a whole lot of pop culture.

Unstable Fables: Goldilocks And The 3 Bears takes the idea of the blond-haired girl who breaks into the home of three porridge-eating bears to a whole new level. Goldilocks, voiced by Jamie Lynn Spears is portrayed as a spoiled television starlet and host of a home renovation show called Fab Rehab.

The three bears, in this case a lower working class family consists of Mac Bear (Tom Arnold), Ruby (Brooke Shields) and Junior Bear (Colton Parsons).  Junior sends a submission tape to the show Fab Rehab and Goldilocks, in effort to gain publicity, selects the bear's house as the next remodel.  In an odd move, she and her crew remodel the home in edible candy. A bee attack destroys the candy house and poor Goldilocks discovers that the disaster results in the cancellation of her show.

Desperate to get Goldilocks back on television and to collect a cut of her pay, her manager (literally a weasel) pitches a new reality show that would put Goldi in the bear's house while they try to resume a normal life; with cameras filming their every move.

If all of this sounds intriguing to you, I can attest that there is a bit of charm contained within even if the plot structure itself is a bit sloppy and heavy-handed.  The humor alternates between a virtual overload of pop culture references (The Dixie Chickens, Rachel Raven Show, American Idol-style talent show judge Simon Owl and so on) and slap stick.  The formula, presumably, is to offer the parents something to giggle about while simultaneously giving the kids the type of in-your-face silliness that's expected in an animated piece.

The trouble is neither source of amusement is ever fully developed here.  Adults will find the modern references cute (but by no means hysterical) and the slapstick is a bit too few and far between to keep a young child glued to the screen.  This situation is slightly further compounded by the plot, which takes a few unnecessary twists and turns to be considered concise by any age group.

Examples of this include the fact that the story would probably be much clearer if it followed one of the bears mainly and allowed the viewer to fill in the gaps of the happenings of the others on their own (as it stands we go to work with dad, school with Junior, auditions with mom and even closely follow Goldilocks in her home life).  Another example that comes to mind is the whole concept that we need to follow along while Goldi hosts the home makeover show, only to get canned, then begin the reality show bit.  One can't help but assume it would have flowed much smoother to simply begin with the reality show angle.

On the other hand, the visuals are bright and clean and the humor is always any-age appropriate.  It's a safe bet to say that younger kids would get a kick out of this one even if there are better examples of the medium out there, many of which occupy the same store shelf.",1286496000,,3847,4.773755656108597

8246629,5,B0012KZM8M,"This movie has the perfect blend of cutting edge technology and realistic fantasy, creating a world with such depth and wonder that you'll be rushing to online review sites to spread the word.
The first time I saw these 20 consecutive minutes of genius, I felt a slight tingling in my fingers almost immediately. Prying my eyes away from the tv screen, I saw that the reality of my body was being slowly warped, pulled, and swallowed by three shining televisions that had appeared beside and behind me. The blue puddle man quickly assured both me and Goldilocks that there was nothing to fear and everything to gain. Surrendering to the Lawrence Vision experience, I became one with Goldilocks, using my crimped hair to wreak vengeance on the Ursa Gods who had turned the once peaceful fairy goddess into a conjuring thief, using black magic to steal hats from the poor/bald and give tax-free to the rich bear folk of Spindlevillle. After receiving my trophy stuffed doll as a token of appreciation from Lawrence himself, I faded slowly back into this world, my home, a changed woman.
