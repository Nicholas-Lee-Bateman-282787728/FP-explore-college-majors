6268246,5,B00IK5ZZOS,"This documentary took me back to Christmas Eve 1968 at my father's house in Dallas, my younger brother and I watching this unfold live on television.  I remember my dad saying, ""Boys, this is history in the making...""  It was difficult for him to explain why to 7 & 9-year old boys, and we didn't fully understand at that age, but I do remember.  I also remember the reading of Genesis by the crew, but it didn't impact me emotionally like it did in this documentary.  I believe Kevin Kertscher did a wonderful job with this documentary, and it looks like he made it as a labor of love.  My first ""5"" on anything I have reviewed.",1396137600,7,629,4.3418803418803416

8642918,5,B00IK5ZZOS,"Quite an accomplishment that should not be over shadowed by the first human to actually walk on the moon. This was a bold and daring flight. I think you'll really feel the ""Right Stuff"" while watching this. It was a BOLD decision for Nasa at the time! It's well worth watching!",1482969600,,277,4.450980392156863

8642923,3,B00IK5ZZOS,"I was expecting something more current, along the lines of the fabulous Gene Cernan biocumentary The Last Man on The Moon. That said, it is a well edited film and has Walter Cronkite. Seemed like an expanded version of the Nova documentary from the 90s.",1457481600,,253,4.644444444444445
8642924,5,B00IK5ZZOS,"An excellent return to the termoil and triumphants of the mid eighty's.  As I lived these time's, watching the excitement of Apollo 8 live, this video takes us back to that moment of one of Mankind's greatest achievements.  A gamble of hardware and human endeavour that seemingly  stopped a quarrelling world.  As seen from Apollo 8, Earth rise, above the lunar horizon, the blue marble, our oasis, fragile, yet our only home.",1413244800,5,426,4.875
8642925,5,B00IK5ZZOS,"One of mankind's greatest achievements, landing men on the moon, would not have happened on schedule if it were not for the bold and heroic flight of Apollo 8. Highly recommender for anyone with interest in America's space program.",1396224000,2,231,4.948717948717949
