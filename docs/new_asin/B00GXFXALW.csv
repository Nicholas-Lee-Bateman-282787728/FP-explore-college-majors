6123569,5,B00GXFXALW,Thanks you guys!  My baby loves these lil guys now she gets to watch them when ever she gets ready and they have all of her songs she likes!,1408924800,,140,3.8275862068965516

6123571,5,B00GXFXALW,"The Big Bugs Band is one of the most clever and fun little music videos I've seen.  Both boys that I take care of LOVE it!  The band plays their various genres of music - each one a perfect length for toddler attention spans - and they are followed by The Jammers.  I wasn't so impressed with them at first, but they grow on you. I think the graphics just aren't as sophisticated.  But i think the goal of the video is to expose toddler-aged children to various types of music and their components, instruments, and enjoyment derived from listening and playing music.  One of ;my' boys (both under 2) seems to prefer the bugs, whereas the other really lights up with the Jammers.  It's nice because you can play this and just listen to the music - thereby limiting screen time for the kids. Also, they both mimic various sounds that the bugs make, which is the beginning of speech and vocalization.  Remember to watch and participate with them!  You'll love it too.",1403568000,,965,4.505747126436781
6123572,5,B00GXFXALW,We found Big Bugs Band on U Tube and my daughter loves them I was so glad I found them on dvd for her so she will always have them.,1400198400,,131,3.4
6123573,3,B00GXFXALW,"My son loves these little guys and the DVD said it was approximately 50 minutes so I thought there would be a lot of songs. Unfortunately there are only about eight songs and the rest of the DVD is another baby tv show that isn't very good. We don't usually watch much tv so the 20 minutes of bugs is enough, but it's misleading to say it's a bug concert when it's really more of another show.",1395273600,6,393,4.116883116883117
