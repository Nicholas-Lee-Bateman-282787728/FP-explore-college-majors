8539106,5,B000099530,"This is a great tape in a series of great videos. Basic to advanced instruction from some of the best Swing instructors and dancers around. Many dancers try to teach but do not have the ability to break the moves down and articulate what is going on the way that Marcus and Barbl do. This is a must have video for your swing collection.
Also, the jam at the end of the tape is a real treat!",1061510400,,390,4.077922077922078
