2452772,3,B000C42EOE,"Recorded in car looking straight ahead most of the time. For a ""Casual"" and ""scenic"" ride, you don't see much. They'll keep you occupied while riding your stationary bike, but you won't go ""WOW"" to the scenery. Could be better.",1241049600,4,227,4.7
2452773,4,B000C42EOE,"I found the Bike-o-vision DVD to be quite satisfactory even though it is obviously filmed from the dashboard of a car.  The speed was about right, and I enjoyed it.  My husband, on the other hand, felt that there wasn't enough looking around at scenery, and as he said, ""Who wants to stare at a road for 45 minutes?""  He also didn't like the music.  (I did.)  So, I'll continue to use it...my husband probably won't.",1234569600,7,416,4.421052631578948
2452774,1,B000C42EOE,"I bought this video and two other Bike-O-Vision DVDs for my husband because he gets bored easily on the stationery bike.  His complaint was that the video is boring, very seldom does your view move from the road ahead to see other scenery.  The city of Savannah, Georgia looks like any-where-USA.  Just roads, buildings.  So what?  I watched this video this morning to get my take on it and I agree with my husband. Boring.",1197244800,5,423,4.586666666666667
2452775,5,B000C42EOE,"Awesome video! First time I watched it was at a friends house. He was showing me some of the scenery of the video while we were on the couch. ;)  I don't have a bike but I have a tred-mill and it was pretty fun running to this. Felt like I was running faster. Great video and I got your other ones too. Thanks for putting out something different then all the other generic videos out there. Getting a bike as well, but your videos keep you interested enough so running was fun too.

Oh, btw I read that comment from the woman talking about a carmicheal training video. They put out some of the MOST generic videos. Boring is not what you want when your exercising.

Thanks again!",1173571200,5,679,4.248062015503876
2452776,5,B000C42EOE,I have  never been on some of these scenic highways.  This video was a great way to see some awesome landscapes while working out!  Nice work!,1173398400,6,142,4.384615384615385
8095637,5,B000C42EOE,Love this wish there was one for certain specific countries. Like Britain now that I know I'm British I'd like to see the area. It's still quite fun to tour Savannah Georgia.,1465862400,,174,4.46875
8095638,2,B000C42EOE,"Not bad if you like going 40 mph.
I wish I could ride my bike that fast!
Way to fast to enjoy.",1436400000,,94,3.3181818181818183
8095639,5,B000C42EOE,"I believe this dvd starts at the fountain of Oglethorpe Park Savannah, Ga. (where I was born) so I'm partial to this video!!!  No surprise, right?  :-)  Lovely city tour; only wish it included the water front area!  Pleasant views however with the lovely moss covered trees.  This has a nice pace for just touring on my spinner bike as opposed to the heart thumping regular spinner dvd workouts.  This bov dvd is one of my faves!  Time to head to my gym.  lol :-D",1432684800,2,463,4.364705882352941
8095640,5,B000C42EOE,"excellent visuals, but classical music only good for work outs in small doses- would have preferred some more upbeat, rock music. Maybe royalty issues obtaining rock music?",1397001600,,172,5.407407407407407
8095641,5,B000C42EOE,I purchased this DVD for my indoor spin cycle sessions and I really enjoyed it. It has lovely scenery to help add a little variety to indoor training days. The disk plays light instrumental music but I prefer to pop my headset in instead and just keep it muted. You can tell that it is a dash mounted video and there are a few moments where there are not quite natural bike moves but overall this is a really well done DVD.,1395187200,3,423,4.170731707317073
8095642,3,B000C42EOE,I looked forward to using this DVD and have looked for this type for years.  It works for me somewhat but I would have liked it to show more scenery instead of highway.,1361836800,,168,4.090909090909091
8095643,4,B000C42EOE,"came in timely manner in good condition, thanks  we really like the setting an way it really makes you feel you in the outdoors",1361232000,,127,4.291666666666667
8095644,5,B000C42EOE,"I can ride indoor bike for an hour and ride through beautiful place's ! I really liked how they speed up on straight aways ,I pedal faster too.",1358467200,,143,4.142857142857143
8095645,4,B000C42EOE,"REALLY HELPS WITH MY FITNESS. I WATCH THE COUNTRYSIDE GO BY INSTEAD OF FEELING THE ""BURN"" THIS DVD WILL INCREASE THE TIME SPENT EXERCISING. NO MORE LOOKING AT THE CLOCK.",1284681600,2,169,4.666666666666667
8095646,5,B000C42EOE,"Exercise has to be interesting and inviting to me or I won't do it.

This is working! I don't like exercising in public. Whether it's walking, running, or otherwise sweat-producing exercise, I want to do it from the comfort of my home gym, at any time of the day or night I feel like exercising.

I never really got 'excited' about doing time on the treadmill. I would scan to see if there were any good shows or movies on to get me through it, but it just wasn't working. I have 20 lbs. to lose. I needed to get consistent.

The first one I tried won me over. It was the California Coastline, which included Big Sur, my favorite place to be. I meant to try another Bike-O-Vision the next day, but I went back to this one. Love it!

The second one was the Washington D.C., Maryland area one, which had a patriotic feel to it and lots of upbeat music.

The third one, which I did last night, was this one, All Across America. Whoever chose the music did an awesome job! It keeps me moving and reminds me to change the pace once in a while. Some members of my family would NOT agree about the music, and for those who only prefer one kind of music and this isn't it, I say, bring your own music. Bring whatever sounds inspire you.

I hope they will go back to some of these states and show more of what they have to offer. For example, Oklahoma is not all Plains. It would be great if they chose to do the Talimena Scenic Drive across the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas and Oklahoma, if they dared. It might not be safe, but I'll buy it if they do.

In fact, I'll probably buy most, if not all, of the Bike-O-Vision DVDs eventually. These really make a difference. My workouts are much more consistent, which makes it a healthy choice, very much worth the money for me.",1267142400,3,1773,4.227810650887574
