5541739,5,B00B1952SO,I am a big fan of Andre Rieu have seen him on stage twice. His concerts are a dream. He is so talented as are his orchestra. There is always humour and smiles from them. It is a pleasure to watch and listen to them. Happy Birthday was a really happy dvd to watch.,1367366400,,263,3.888888888888889
5541740,5,B00B1952SO,"I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THIS ONE.  IT SOUNDED LIKE 25 YEARS OF REPEAT NUMBERS.
AND IN SOME WAYS IT DID CONTAIN RERUNS...BUT IN A NEW FORMAT.  THE DVD IS VERY ENJOYABLE, AT LEAST TO ME.  RIEU TAKES IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT HE RETURNS IT TO FANS IN THE ELABORATE CONCERTS HE PRODUCES. THEY ARE ALL TOP QUALITY.

I HAVE SEEN RIEU TWICE IN PERSON.  I AM HAPPY TO HAVE DONE SO.  HOWEVER THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE IS AT HOME WATCHING THE DVD'S. I PERSONALLY OWN MANY OF HIS DVD'S AND DO NOT GET TIRED OF THEM.

I ENJOY WATCHING THE MAASTRICT PEOPLE RESPONDING TO RIEU IN THE VRIJTHOF SQUARE.  THEY WERE DOING SO FROM STREET LEVEL UP TO THE OPEN WINDOWS AND ROOF TOPS OF THE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS AROUND THE SQUARE. THEY REALLY KNOW HOW TO CELEBRATE THE MUSIC.
AS ALWAYS THE MAASTRICT PEOPLE WERE NICLY DRESSED AS ARE ALL THE ORCHESTRA MEMBERS.  THEY REALLY SEEM TO ENJOY THE CONCERT FROM ALL THEIR LOCATIONS, IN HOMES, AND THE OUTSIDE CAFES'.",1366416000,16,937,4.278409090909091
5541741,5,B00B1952SO,"I've collected all but two of Andre's DVD's and enjoy each and every one.  (The other two are only available in PAL unfortunately).

I'll be on the look out for the next DVD and can't beat Amazon as a source of great videos.",1366156800,6,321,4.406779661016949
5541742,5,B00B1952SO,The cd by Andre Rieu was very enjoyable. I noticed he did the song When I am 64.  Very appropriate as he will be 64 in October of 2013.,1365811200,4,135,3.6551724137931036

You can see you are not going to get anything new. The atmosphere will be good but not new, so it`s up to you make a choice. Personally I will skip this one my Rieu Shelf is full",1361059200,13,1280,4.369747899159663
5541755,5,B00B1952SO,Typically excellent Andre Rieu.,1431561600,,31,7.0
5541756,5,B00B1952SO,"As far as I'm concerned, if you only buy two Andre Rieu videos, one should be ""Home for Christmas"" which no doubt will join such classics as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" on your annual holiday must watch list.

This one marking the 25th anniversary of the annual concerts in Rieu's home base of Maastricht is the other.
It starts out with the more traditional mix of classical and modern music that is typical of Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra, and by the end you've been drawn into what can be best described as a wonderful neighborhood block party with people literally singing and dancing in the streets.

You will be hard pressed to not find yourself humming one or more of the tunes after watching this one, so grab a chair, turn up the surround sound and enjoy.",1429056000,,793,4.538461538461538

5541761,5,B00B1952SO,LOVE LOVE ANDRE RIEU HAVE SEVERAL OF HIS CD'S AND DVD'S - HE'S THE BEST THERE IS,1404345600,,80,3.764705882352941
5541762,5,B00B1952SO,"When I went to my first Andre' Rieu concert over 20 years ago, I knew I was witness to a phenomenon. The music was spellbinding, the Orchestra and Choir were mesmerizing, and the acts were unlike anything I had ever seen. Being a child of Detroit's Motown, and working in the entertainment world, I could never have imagined that this ""long hair"" music from 100 years ago could be arranged and performed so as to touch, renew, and draw in the public as nothing ever has. Who ever heard of a conductor that could so touch the heart and soul of an audience to the point that hundreds of us in the theater got to our feet and danced with people we didn't even know for the entire concert !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not surprising that this man and his Orchestra/Choir/Guests continue to play to sold out audiences around the world, and have spiraled to the top of the charts for so long. I would recommend this DVD to everyone, as just like all his other DVD's, you have just purchesed the best seat in the house, your livingroom. Take this 25 year journey with Andre' and be witness to the priceless talents he discovers in his travels and brings to you to enjoy. It would be a sad loss of joy if you miss the magic, beauty, and brilliance of Kimmy Skota singing Casta Diva, Carla Maffioletti with The Laughing Song (watch your chandelier), The Platin-Tenors with Nessun Dorma (gives one goose bumps), or sexy Carmen Monarcha seducing us all with Habanera. The unleashed antics and humor of the Johann Struss Orchestra and Choir will cause you to wonder "" What could they possibly be drinking?"" So purchase the DVD, gather your friends, put on your party hats and be prepared to rock the house with a party no one will stop talking about. Never be put off by ANY Rieu DVD done in a foreign language, as your DVD player can be set to Sub-Title option, and they are so well done that none of the content is ever lost in translation. Enjoy and BRAVO to the master of music and entertainment !!!",1400371200,10,1979,4.469613259668508
