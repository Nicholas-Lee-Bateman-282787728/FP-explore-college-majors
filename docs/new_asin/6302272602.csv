Looks,Hair,Skin&Class etc.. however some things last to  long.the musical aspect doesn't really work except for the SUper  Talented&fine Late Phyllis Hyman who sings her heart out.it has it's  moments.",950918400,3,340,5.377358490566038
451361,2,6302272602,"This was only Spike Lee's second movie, and he had a lot of growing up to do.  Thankfully, he did grow up and made some good stuff like ""Do The Right Thing"", ""Jungle Fever"" and ""Malcolm X"".  I  thought that the movie tried to take itself too seriously (yes, I'm talking  about that mess of an ending)and had numerous scenes that I felt were  cheezy and unnecessary. What was up with the broadway acts? I felt that  this movie had nothing to do with black colleges. There are a lot more to  them than just stomp shows and ridiculous rivalries between frat parties  that Spike could have featured if he wanted to make a movie about the Black  college experience. But I did enjoy the debates between the Larry Fishburne  and Esposito's characters. I felt that their arguments about how African  Americans should represent their roots were thought provoking and valid. As  far as watching anything that has something to do with Black colleges, the  close as anyone is going to get for now are old reruns of ""A Different  World"".",948844800,4,1024,4.585635359116022

Or, if they didn't go to all-black college, it  will make think, ""Did I really miss anything?""",930873600,,272,4.4

Light skinned blacks versus dark skinned blacks. Straight hair versus kinky hair. Pledging to fraternities and sororities as a way to belong to something that is considered good.

Black America is different than White America. I will explain. White America usually have privilege and power and are well aware of how to use it to get what they need and want. Black America has a different existence. If blacks want to make it in America, they have to work extra hard to succeed. If blacks are educated, they are discriminated against by uneducated blacks. The lists goes on and on.

Spike Lee is known for controversy and this movie definitely is controversial. This movie was made 25 years ago yet these issues still exist today in 2013. I didn't want to believe that but I see it in the media practically everyday and within black communities.

I found that he touched on some issues that needed to be addressed (such as light/dark and townie/student). In fact, Samuel Jackson's portrayed of town citizen who gets into the altercation with Dap (Lo Burne) over students coming to town and ""taking all the jobs"" is classic. However, I did not care for the portrayal of greks.

It is so much wrong and negative about greek life that alot of greeks I know totally ignore what is shown. In fact, we look at this movie despite the fact that it is probably the most negative portrayal of greek life. For whatever reason, he doesn't like us to much, when in fact Dap is the one off base on some levels.

Someone as socially aware and talented as Spike Lee should have shown both sides of the coin, not just clearly his negative take on greek life. For alot of greek friends and family I have across the board, greek life has been one of the most fun, challenging, and rewarding experiences, and that's simply negated in the film.

452012,4,6302272602,"So to comment on the movie itself: It was a great movie!  I'm glad I finally saw it (watched the Amazon on Demand rental).  The characters are natural and the entire thing feels real, not contrived.  You can tell the cast and crew put their work in trying to create a real college experience on-screen.  And as a 2008 graduate of Spelman, I enjoyed seeing the recognizable campus locations filmed in the earlier parts of the movie :)  The musical numbers were just weird, though; with the exception of Tisha Campbell's number and the scene at the bathing suit party, they seemed out of place and kind of wacky.  Interesting, definitely, but I wasn't expecting them.

I will say this. When I was in high school all everyone could talk about was School Daze and how they couldn't wait to go to college and pledge partially because of what they saw here.  I did go to an HBCU in the mid-2000s, but some of the experiences in the movie made me go ""huh"".  I know that Lee's Morehouse experience happened in the mid-to-late 70s, and this movie was filmed in the late 80s, so I think a lot of things at HBCUs and with Greeks in particular were different - especially given that pledging was above-ground then and is mostly underground now.  You don't see a line of Pyramids or Sphinxmen all dressed alike in public anymore.  But more importantly, I don't feel like my HBCU experience (Morehouse-Spelman-Clark Atlanta community) had the same timbre that Lee's maybe did in the 70s or that was portrayed here in the 80s - this sort of disjointed, fractured black community.  I had Greek friends even though I'm not Greek; colorism wasn't as much of an issue; and pretty much everyone on campus was involved in the community and political activism in some way.  So I only saw parts of my experience reflected here - the crazy themed homecoming party, the homecoming game (and losing badly).

452172,3,6302272602,"Many reviewers have commented on how accurate Spike Lee's portrayal of 1980's college life in ""School Daze"" was. I cannot claim this, but having graduated college in 2006 I can say that I have seen nearly all of Lee's poignant scenes with my own eyes during my college career in the 00's.  In this sense, Lee has a gift for seeing things, writing about them and directing them so realistically on film. Not to mention the fact that his insights have obviously stood the test of time (well, at least 20 years). The insanity of fraternities and sororities, the social activists on campus, the virgins, nuances of being a lighter skin African-American or a darker skin African-American, the sweet innocence of bringing someone to your dorm room at home (when your roommate is not there, hoping to get lucky!), the sports games (which Spike doesn't even show you the field, only the reactions of the onlookers), men teasing each other, woman teasing each other, the non-student townies wandering the streets. Spike's got this film jam-packed with the essence of college.

Lee's father's music is once again in this film, which is great. The actors, are great. Everything is perfect, however not me.

I can't quite explain it, but after watching this movie I thought, ""Well, that was OK"". This is now, the second film of Spike Lee's that I have watched, and I must say that, if I did not know who the director was before I watched the movie I think that I would easily guess that this was made by a young person. A person who is still hoping to change the world by shouting, rather than by doing. For this, there is something about this movie that is annoying.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie, it was surely fun, entertaining and poignant to some extent, however I just can't seem to get over an air of immaturity.  But what am I looking for? Spike Lee is just over thirty when he made this picture. Before I talk smack about Spike, let's see what I have accomplished by the time I turn thirty!

In fact the entire movie is unconventional but this is probably why it's so exciting and fun.

If I were you I would definitely buy this movie. It is a little culturally bias in that it is not really geared for Caucasian people to understand. It's mostly aimed at the African American community.",1197504000,2,538,4.78494623655914
452175,4,6302272602,"My My My 1988. A lot was going on that year.  The Huxtables was in the middle of captivating audiences worldwide as America's favorite family on ""The Cosby Show"".  ""A Different World"" wasn't yet the funny and insightful spinoff it would become in later seasons.  The showtime Lakers were the reigning NBA dynasty, the ""Bad Boy Pistons"" were quickly becoming the beast of the east, and Micheal Jordan became the fastest rising star of the NBA. Underprivileged Blacks and working class americans were still feeling the effects of ""Regannomics"" only to give way to the Bush Sr. era (which wasn't any better). The Golden era of hip hop was in full effect with the most priceless possession being Public Enemy's ""It takes a nation of millions to hold us Back"".  Guy and Keith Sweat would only revolutionize R&B in a way that P.E. revolutionized hip hop. and any Mike Tyson fight was a major event on television.

Some of ya'll may be buggin' on my trip down memory lane but School Daze does that me! Out of all of Spike Lee movies, this may be his most overlooked film along with ""Bamboozled"" and ""He Got Game"".  This inspired if flawed movie was ahead of its time in exploring the class differences in the black race. but rather than beat a dead horse that has alraedy been tried and won by other reviewers who made the same point about the point of black on black discrimination in this movie, I wanna bring up  some points that adds to the high quality of this great movie.

In my opinion, the two key elements that makes this a powerful film are the three main characters and the musical skits.  There's never a dull moment as Laurence Fishburne is reliably compelling as the soically aware Mission College student who's asking the school to divest their money in South Africa.  Giancarlo Esposito is a convincingly menancing (in a school bully type of way) as the narcissistic frat leader of Gamma Fi Gamma. Not only is he the perfect moral adversary to Dap's(Laurence fishburne) agenda, his frat brothers, the hopeful Pledgers, and the those lovely Gamma Rays led by his Girlfriend Jane(Tisha Campbell), stregthens his power tripping vanity which provides many of the film's laughs. Half Pint (played by yours truly) brings more comic relief as the charmingly pathetic cousin of Dap as he pledges to be a member of G Fi G.  He's also a perfect medium between the conscience driven Dap and the image driven  Julian (or Dean Big Brother Almighty as Half Pint likes to call him).

Some complain about the musical skits being overdone. That's true, but they're also fun and provides an extra edge to the film's story.  The hair musical between the light skinned Gamma Rays and the dark skinned sisters, drives home the point of how these opposing sides resents each other's skin color and how they wouldn't trade places with each other if they could save money on their next trip to the hair dresser. Powerful stuff Spike.  That doesn't compare to the best scene of the movie when Dap and his boys interrupt G Fi G's stepping routine to perform a routine bashing the Gammas (Daddy long stroke).  Too funny!! the daddy long stroke scene is one of Spike lee's best of all his films.  EU's cameo appearance is bound to bring back nostalgic memories of times when we and our mamas were doing ""Da Butt"".

School daze has a steady balance between entertianment and the seriousness about the dislike blacks display toward each other.

While School daze is entertaining as well as educational it's not without its flaws.  While Dap, julian, and Half Pint's intentions are clear, thier characters lack range.  The film spends too much time reaffirming Dap's social conscience and Julian's vanity as a cocky frat leader.  How many times does the film have to stress Dap resentment toward appartiad in South Africa and Julian's egocentric indulgences. They don't provide any personal insight to their characters that give viewers a reason why they act the why they do as individuals  as it relates to the main story. In addition to the lack of motive, the film don't give the main characters a chance to deeply reflect on their lifestyles and views and how it affects themselves as well as those around them.  The best and the worst of guys have motives and some sort of reflection and that's the film biggest setback.  The dialogue is so repetitive that the film's finale with Dap urging everyone to wake up is not as climatic as it intends to be since that point has been hit home so many times throught the course of the film.

If the characters were better textured with more range and if they used that character depth to deepen the story, Spike Lee could've had another classic under his belt.  But as it stands, I would say School Daze is a near classic that would've been a much tighter film without the excess.

It isn't My favorite but it is still a great movie for anyone that wants to get a small notion of what black college life is/was like.

As a matter of fact, the issue of lightskinned vs. darkskinned is still going on today, on a college campus or not. Spike Lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time. He is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the African American community. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen it, get the DVD. It's a classic.",1170892800,2,446,4.1976744186046515

There is some resentment from the residents in the West End and University Homes; there is an elitetist attitude from some of the frats; there is an air of apathy among the student population, and when this film first hit theaters, most students weren't even born! There is talk a sequel is in the works, as Spike announced during NSO. An excellent introduction to HBCUs! And one of his better films...",1165190400,3,572,4.73

In fact, I'm positive Lee, a Morehouse alum, combined the two schools to create ""Mission College""... Sans the musical interludes, this movie is so realistic, and the message is so powerful.

452237,5,6302272602,"It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the HBCU experience, period. Just look at ""A Different World"" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND ""School Daze"", but you had to have attended one to get the real ""flavor"" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind.

Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call ""dirty laundry"" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you ""white"", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no ""good"" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points.

One thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more ""destroying from within"" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. (""I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!"") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your ""status"" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said ""That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?"" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said.

I'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a ""real"" college. I wouldn't trade my experience at Florida A&M University for a degree at any PWC. RATTLERS!",1142812800,18,2542,4.607064017660044

452308,5,6302272602,"Even with a small budget, Spike Lee can still get a lot done and still find great actors.  Spike Lee's ""School Daze"" is probably his best flim standing next to ""Malcomb X"" respectively.  The movie was released in 1988, 10 years before I even entered college, and all of issue that disrupted and seperated the black student body then, were still at the forefront when I went to college.  Every character can be found somewhere on your college campus now whether you are at an HBCU or not.  The movie is filled with many memorable scenes and will leave you with a feeling of belonging to one group or the other: either a black-frat-cat or a black conseious community builder.  The movie also embodies Spike Lee's theatrical style that depicts the black culture of the time, talks about its issues, and in turn influences its future.  For example, this movie influend late 80's and early 90's Hip-Hop music, the way we dressed and how we thought about HBCU's.  As a matter of fact, southern HBCU's had a enormous growth in enrollment from blacks across the country after this movie was realeased in '88 and the ever so popular ""FreakNeak"" in Atlanta, GA was born out of this movie.  It's a must see for any person wanting to know more about college life for black students.  A great movie.",1138060800,5,1286,4.605263157894737

Like most of Spike Lee's movies this one was criticized and given low ratings, but if you have the mind state to look deeper into the storyline than the obvious then you can see the beauty in this work of art. After searching high and low to find a copy, I am happy that Amazon has a copy of, to me, the greatest movie ever made. Now in college I love it more because I can relate to the social issues.

The 2 disc is NOT of the movie. It's a DVD and the CD soundtrack. However, they don't tell you that on the packaging. What a RIP-OFF!!!

I am soooo disappointed. Please don't get fooled...if you are thinking of buying the new release of School Daze...my advice is DON'T!! keep your old copy...you'll be gald you did.",1110499200,11,562,4.3428571428571425

I really loved all the singing and dancing. But when I got older, thats when I got the message of movie. Thats what makes this movie such as classic. The only thing I don't like about it is that I read the book about the making of School Daze and Spike cut out so many scenes that would have been good for the movie. It would have made some of the scenes easier to understand. I wished he would've put them on the DVD. But still, one of the greatest black films of all time.",1093996800,4,647,3.8721804511278197
452313,5,6302272602,"To the person who gave this movie five stars yet panned this film, this is a film parodying life at a fictional HBCU during its homecoming, with a focus on three groups on campus: ""Da Fellas"" and their women (the women are known in the ""Straight and Nappy"" musical bit as the Jiggaboos, a racist term for African-Americans, because the women refuse to relax their hair), the people who would rather urge Mission College to divest from South Africa because of discrimination at that time; Gamma Phi Gamma and the Gammites, men who claim to have true brotherhood but dish out abusive punishments and orders to ""obtain"" that brotherhood; and the Gamma Rays (also known as the Wannabes because most--note I did not say all--of these women are light-skinned African Americans that relax their hair and are apparently rich), women that are just mere sex objects and trophies to the Gammas.  And no, Spike Lee does not play Urkel--otherwise, he'd be wearing suspenders and speaking in an annoying nasal voice.  He plays one of the Gammites who just happens to be connected to Dap (Lawrence Fishburne), one of Da Fellas.  Of course, during its time, several people didn't understand this film. For example, while ""School Daze"" was shooting, the then-president of Morehouse kicked Lee and his cast and crew off of the college (Lee's alma mater) for the portrayal of the Mission College school president in the movie, who is dark-skinned.  ""School Daze"" is a parody focusing mainly on colorism (discrimination among African-Americans based on skin tone), such as the view that the lighter your skin is if you're black, the more doors open for you (which was true prior to intergration laws).  I really do like this movie, especially the song sequences done by cast members (""Straight and Nappy,"" ""Be Alone Tonight"").  I really encourage people to see this film. Although I realize this movie is not considered to be as good as ""Do the Right Thing"" or ""She's Gotta Have It,"" this movie does have a point, and most people, despite their race, can relate to the themes presented in this movie.",1081036800,8,2080,4.861581920903955
452314,5,6302272602,"I have to totally disagree with the editorial review stating the movie doens't come together. The movie does come together speaking of divisions on different planes. Whether it's on the campus of an HBCU or urban city, people of color have come across that division of ""wannabees"" & ""jigaboos"". In so many movies, we point our fingers at ""them"" for not treating us as equals but this movie made us to forcible point at ourselves. It made us look at how we discriminate among ourselves that white is right and black in bad. What is the real purpose of sororities & fraternities. We need to be reminded why HBCUs were built - because we couldn't attend elsewhere because of discrimination - yet we discriminate ourselves. Spike is reminding us to not become lulled into a deep sleep with material trappings (cars, jewelry, etc.) and wake up to reality. We can't stand together if divided among ourselves. I highly recommend this movie. It also allows you to see stars in their early years. I also cherish scenes of the late Phyllis Hyman.",1057622400,3,1036,4.7292817679558015

In the end Spike Lee reminds the viewer to Wake Up!!. Simply put that all these topics discussed in the movie is Nonsense and Foolish too go on.

The new DVD edition is a must (make sure you're buying the right edition on Amazon), because it includes Spike Lee's commentary throughout the movie.  Watching the movie with the commentary makes for a fascinating journey into filmmaking.  Without spoiling it too much, Mr. Lee discusses everything from his contentious relations with the Morehouse administration to the relationships between cast and crew members.  One insight he offered stuck with me.  He said that he housed the crew members of the competing factions in separate hotels (the jigaboos got the worst hotel), so that they could stay true to their roles and to foster role competition.  Apparently, it worked a little too well.  I'll let you buy the DVD to find out why.
In short, School Daze is a picture into a life that the large majority of us, of all backgrounds, will never get to experience directly.  Its value is to take unfamiliar observers into one facet of the African-American experience and to do so with remarkable realism and insight.",992908800,6,1190,4.944723618090452
452361,5,6302272602,"As an African American, fraternity member I found this movie not only entertaining, but also convicting.  Being a man of Omega (those familiar with the Black Greek system know what I mean) I was a little offended by Gamma Phi Gamma's dipiction of the ""dogs.""  More often than once I felt he was referring to the ""dogs of Purple and Gold.""  Yet, once I got beyond my petty sensitivities, Lee's underlying critique of the social ills plaguing the African American community revolving around issues of social consciousness, skin color, hair texture, education, etc., made this movie provocative and challenging.  Also, it's depiction of homecoming, pledging, parties and general ""college life"" made for an entertaining walk down memory lane.  I found his attempt at making this a musical production to be somewhat forced, although the lyrics of the songs were pointedly appropriate.
I may not completely agree with Lee's conclusion concerning the advantages (or disadvantages) of participating in the Black Greek System.  However, I appreciate his candid attempt to ""tell it like it is.""  My mother used to say, ""Don't air the dirty laundry in public.""  This is exactly what Lee has done, and unfortunately it is about time.",986860800,36,1221,5.1313131313131315
452362,4,6302272602,"I once heard on a TV talk show that you don't have to be a parent to know about kids.  This was uttered by a single female with tons of doctorate credentials.  As I listened, having kids of my own, I found her comments clinical and devoid of those fundamentals any parent experiences during daily contact with their offspring.  I subsequently disregarded most of her observations with the exception of the obvious.  Some things do have to be experienced.  With that said, Spike Lee's School Daze had to be experienced to really appreciate the social comments being made.  Being a graduate of Howard University (an Afro-American college since federal inception) in Washington, D.C., I could readily identify with the life and social levels depicted.  This movie is FUBU (For Us By Us).  The distinction between light skinned and dark skinned, ""good hair"" and ""kinks"", ""Greeked"" (Fraternity/Sorority) and outsiders, upper-class, middle-class and no-class, may be lost in an already segmented society.  However, it hits home to anyone (irregardless of ethnic background) who has attended historically rooted colleges and universiies.  The voluntary (and involuntary!) sub-segmentation on campus is real and extant.  Spike Lee's direction, musical scenes and comedic comment, gives us a laugh at these really stupid concepts.  Laurence Fishburne as usual gives an excellent performance as a politically aware student, trying to change a system that cannot be changed, and personally changing because of it.  Spike Lee plays his usual ""Baby, baby, pleaseee baby, baby"" self-depreciating character caught-up in fraternity life but willing to play for the perceived rewards of acceptance.  Giancarlo Esposito is the fraternity leader and movie antagonist bent maintaining class/segment separation.  Tisha Campbell (Martin - TV show co-star) plays Esposito's ""girlfriend"" and gives an excellent performance as a ""have"" who is victimized by her own would-be ascension and maintenance of same.  This movie demonstrates our society's nature for congregation by segregation as we matriculate through a ""Black"" college and the surrounding urban community.  View this movie with an inquisitive mind and you'll find it a very entertaining movie.  View it with a similar background and it will haunt you.  On a lighter note, of all the musical numbers one of my favorite scenes is the talent show when Tisha Campbell belts out a soul-stirring song so strong I want to ""play"" (read blast) it every summer when the weather is hot, the windows are rolled-down and the world is out.",980380800,75,2562,5.3283582089552235

The scene in the fast food restaurant where the locals and the the college kids clash shows that even African Americans have issues amongst each other.  African Americans just like any other race or religious group need to accept each others differences and get along.
