8535279,1,B000HD1P6S,Very disappointing!!  This video was no more than a shallow sales pitch.  For any one who has been to the hotel it was superficial and left out most of what makes this hotel great--the interior decorating by famed architect  Mary Colter in the 1929 remodeling.  Also no mention of its role as one of the Santa Fe railroad hotels that created today's hotel.  To top it off the video quality was far below today's standards.,1357603200,,422,4.573333333333333
