8339576,4,B001SAOTSK,"I bought the whole beginner-intermediate-advanced volumes 1-2-3 and found the course to be very helpful. I don't have a set of Nunchaku at the moment but they are in the post as my set got lost as things happened that stopped me from training but ill enjoy learning at my own pace and getting back into the swing of things. The double Nunchaku training looks straight forward!.

Thanks for publishing
