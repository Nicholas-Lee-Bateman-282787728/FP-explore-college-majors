8664769,5,B00L9VLTLI,"Much akin to the director's Spirit of the Beehive, this also takes place in same era sort of but maybe not. A story rolled backwards to past, present, future is askew will olive and dark emollient colors dimly lit by candles and dusk/dawn overt hues. A child's tale for adults, this may be better than the Beehive flick told a decade before almost to the date. Nothing looks or pulsates like this film. Unique amongst western European filmic cinema, this vibrates with human elements in angst almost mute dialogue understood in nods of silence. Demure, provocative, enticing, subtle, and haunting to the nth degree, we hang bated until the agonizing end unfolds, not surprising. This is way cool highlighted in yellow traces fading to tan/to light brown, candles out, the end. Gloriously lit. Timelessly well told tale.. Even in today's Spanish films this remains oblique in relations between parents and their kids. As a visual fugue, the cinema from late 1960s until late 1980s is a planet orbiting in a different universe. Alone, spoken in color palettes of olive, kaki, blonde, brown, and brunettes. Pretty in the nearer to darker with little light. Shine on.",1531872000,,1163,4.969230769230769
