2219041,5,B0007LXONW,This is one sereis you got to watch all of it. Sometimes a few episodes seem pointless and stray from the storyline. But it always has good action and I got to give it up for the music. It really is the best combination of a modern western. And in the added features the episodes of Mr. Stain on Junk Alley alwasy give me a laugh.,1189814400,,330,4.015151515151516
2219042,5,B0007LXONW,"I had my reservations when I first starting watching the series.  However, to my surprise this series is  just as good as Robotech/Macross.  Each character is distinct, actually has a personality and there is more focus on the personalities while the science is put in the background.  Which is rare since a lot of other Japanese Anime have characters that always seem to be cardboard cut outs of each other and focus to much on the scientific-war plot, if I wanted to see all that than I would watch the Discovery channel.  Burst Angel is NOT like that since, it focuses on the character's and is just fun to watch with it's varying levels of chemistry and character development.  They are not hard to look at either with there seductive wardrobe.  I loved the packaging of the DVD which includes little books with detailed pictures of the characters.  This is a DVD that is well worth the money since, the extras are fun to watch also.  The only thing that I would have liked to have seen in the extras is the actors who actually did the American voices since, they were cool to listen to in the commentary.  But, nothing is 100% perfect.  Burst Angel is pure fun, cool, action packed and has perfect visual quality.",1145664000,9,1218,4.566820276497696
2219043,5,B0007LXONW,"This anime introduces Jo, or ""Angel from Hell"" While at work,she is a beautiful bad-ass women with a direct hit from her guns with a bit of an attitude to show for it, but when she is home, she is the sleepy, lazy, soft spoken type who loves to watch old horror movies after each battle. On her left arm, there is a symbol that goes into play when ever she gets pumped up in a battle, it resembles ""The Devils Wings"". Her 3 friends are Fai, the oldest who is like a mother figure to them. Amy, the tiny wiz kid who's mind works like a computer. And Meg, Jo's closest friend, she's a funny one but also has an attitude to match Jo's. Together, the 4 bounty hunters go to stop any criminal act or plot, this anime is very well written and the beautifully drawn. A 10/10!",1141257600,,768,4.126666666666667
2219044,4,B0007LXONW,"I was pleasantly surprised by this anime. I kept away from this title after all the terrible reviews I've read about it. I guess that goes to show you have to actually watch the show to know if you're gonna like it or not. This show's got robots, guns, and hot chicks in skimpy outfits...a mix for some serious fun! I was hooked by the first episode, it has some great mecha & gun action with good looking cgi. The girls? What can I say? This show has some very hot looking ladies! Whether you keep watching after the first few episodes is up to you. But the first volume is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something exciting to watch.",1140739200,2,655,4.333333333333333
2219045,4,B0007LXONW,"Okay at first when I saw the cover I was a bit hesitant, but for the fact that it had a redhead in the series I couldn't resist. When I watched it I was actually very suprised to find that it was a good anime. The fact that really disgusted me was when I saw the CG animation mixed with 2D animation. However, used to watching crap anime like Zoids... this blended the unique CG animation next to a 2d world, which impressed me very much. The characters are loveable. I don't like the male character reminds me of the Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion. But if you like a little fan service with some action, I reccomend this series. I have personally collected five out of the six volumes. I can't wait until I get the sixth. It is a good series, and it has all the potential to be a gem, and personally it is.",1136246400,2,812,4.178343949044586
2219046,4,B0007LXONW,"Burst Angel is another one of Gonzo Digimation's many releases this year (Gantz, Samurai 7, and Gankutsuou). It's one of those mecha/girls with guns series, only different in that it's a great deal better than the rest. That's not a surprise, as the director, Koichi Ohata, directed great anime films like M.D. Geist and Cybernetics Guardian. How else is it better? Well, read on.

First off, episode one starts out with pure action, and displays quickly what the series will offer in terms of animation quality, as the CG mixes almost perfectly with the 2D effects. Then it goes from there to introduce the main characters, all of them, as quickly as possible: Jo, the fighter without a heart, Meg, the constant Damsel in distress, Amy, the tech-freak, and Sei, the leader of the bunch. They also introduce Kyohei, the lucky chef who gets to take care of these women's meals. After that's out of the way (it takes up probably five minutes of time) they quickly get back into the action. Episode two picks up immediately after as a continuation of episode one, and also introduces us to the dark setting of New Tokyo, devastated by natural disasters and crime, and the monstrous enemy robots called Cybots, free-thinking creatures that love destruction.

From there, episode three starts a new side plot and also reveals the history of the story, how crime became so prevalent on the streets of Tokyo, and the police force known as RAPT that has taken control in more than one way. In this episode, the girls hunt an apparent psychopath who gets kidnapped, and they are forced to follow. Episode four continues this storyline and shows how multi-faceted the series will be, as this episode has action, comedy, drama, and even a little bit of horror. The climactic scene is a blood-fest that leaves you wanting more.

Final impressions: action seems to be the important part in this series, and none of it is generic or recycled. It's mature enough to carry an adult along but still great for older teenagers.

Other bonuses include a great western-style soundtrack, with a beginning theme song that's reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop's opening theme ""Tank."" The voice-acting is top notch, with voices familiar to most Funimation productions. And for those of you who love pointy breasts, this series has fan-service to no end. Plus, it actually has special features, a rare thing in anime DVDs, in the form of outtakes, a radio drama, and text-less songs, not to mention the small art-book that comes with the DVD.

This series reminds me a lot of Bubblegum Crisis 2040, but with a mixture of Mezzo and Armitage along with it. I'd recommend Burst Angel to anyone who enjoyed these anime, or to fans of other Gonzo films.",1135036800,2,2715,4.817596566523605
2219047,3,B0007LXONW,"What is good about ""Burst Angel"" are the character designs, the color palette, and the immersive animation that blends CGI and 2D animation into a coherent environment along with cowboy-style plotting and adventure.

What there is not to like about Burst Angel is truly anemic dialog, the ineffectual male characters, and the oversaturated anime cliches.

What we have here is a big mech anime with amazing action scenes with beautiful color, choreography and design spoiled by really bad dialog and clich&eacute; phrases.  I suggest that if you don't know Japanese, avoid both the English dub and the subtitles and just listen to the dub in Japanese.  At least that way the ""drama"" of the show will still impinge upon you emotionally without having to hear how ridiculous the sentences actually are. Your own imagination of what they really said will be a far better improvement. Again, What I did enjoy was the pacing, the mechs, the warm colors and two or three characters that are not hard to look at so three stars based on how terrific everything appeared and how it was directed.",1129939200,,1086,4.885869565217392
2219048,3,B0007LXONW,"Burst Angel certainly has potential to become interesting. It starts off with an interesting story: A young man going to school to become a chef gets a job as the cook for a rag tag group of gunslingers who are paid to take on missions. The primary ""mercenary"" is Jo, a quiet, tough young woman who shoots first and asks questions later. She is joined by Meg, the seemingly useless, typically big breasted cowgirl of the group (minus the accent), Sei and Amy. While it starts out with some pretty nifty stuff, the focus shifts a bit. The cook becomes less interesting, and to me he's the most interesting character. Meg and Jo seem to take on the spotlight, and they are just a bit too cliched for my tastes. On the other hand, the rest of the series is quite good. The setting is interesting and fun to watch. The action is excellent and well animated. So, if your into something that doesn't require too much focus, but is pretty fun, Burst Angel is worth a check. You might be surprised and like it more than me.",1125792000,3,1015,4.404255319148936
2219049,4,B0007LXONW,"The four episodes are great - the artwork is beautiful, the characters are interesting and the combat is realistic.  There are wheels within wheels when it comes to the plot and there are two story arches within the DVD,so you get a lot of story for your buck.  The main idea is that crime rules most of the city of Tokyo and a team of four girls are trying to help keep the peace.  But they are NOT part of the normal law enforcement units (think A-Team or Bubblegum Crisis).  Rapt seems to run the city, but there are hints of other powers fighting for the top of the hill.  In fact the girls seem to follow commands from somebody else (all we get is a name - it could be a person or a business).

There are also a ton of extras, such as radio dramas, one commentary track, funny outtakes, textless songs and, of course, trailers.  The English Voice Actors are the best.  Jo is played By Monical Rial (Gasaraki, Azumanga Daioh), Meg is played by Jamie Marchie (Fruits Basket) and Kyohei Tachibana is played by Greg Ayres (Full Metal Panic, Gunslinger Girl).  We also get Sei played by Clarine Harp and Amy played by Alison Retzloff (from having been in Kiddy Grade).

Now, heres the bad new.  First, it is ONLY in surround sound, so for guys like me who have only 2.0 stereo, lots of the audio is lost or too soft.  Also, there are subtitle problems.  The opening song, for example, has the subtitles right over the credits.  The radio dramas, but for the first selection, have non subtitles.  Also, the textless closing song in the extras, the English version, has subtitles which can't be turned off.  All this little issues add up and take a little away from the enjoyment.

Yet hearing Monica Rial play a female gunslinger, with cussing and all, made my day.  That is why I only took one point away.  Great anime, nice selection of extras, but sloppy work on putting the DVD together.",1124150400,12,1890,4.441860465116279
2219050,4,B0007LXONW,"Since someone gave a general review of the DVD, this is for those who compare English versus Japanese versions. Overall, the English adaption is very good. Monica Rial wouldn't have been my pick for Jo's voice, but I must say she does a pretty decent Jo... I mean job!  As usual with much of Funimation's stuff, the actors (directors? writers?) take certain liberties with the dialogue that in no way represents what the Japanese actors said; luckily this does not detract (or distract) from the action, story, or the characters. Overall, I enjoyed what the English actors have accomplished!  I'm looking forward to future volumes.

The only constructive criticism: To the translators at Funimation regarding the opening song, ""Loosey"" by the Stripes: Although the words of the first 4 bars or so of the song is most difficult to discern, they should listen to it again VERY carefully.  The subtitles are wrong!

Anyhow, IMHO, Bakuretsu Tenshi aka Burst Angel overall gets my two thumbs up!!  Now, go buy it and support Anime!!",1116288000,,1027,4.941860465116279
