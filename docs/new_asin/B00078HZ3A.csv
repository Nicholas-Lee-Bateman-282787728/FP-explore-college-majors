However, I can support my stated rating of three stars by saying that the music is harsh.  Furthermore, I was unable to appreciate the story line because I do not know the story that the ballet wishes to convey.",1430697600,,338,4.524590163934426
8045894,4,B00078HZ3A,"A vintage performance interpreting the story of Anna Karenina as danced by Maya Plisetskaya, a ballet legend. This probably wouldn't be as appreciated by a newcomer to the art, but to the avid ballet collector this is worth having in your collection.",1394841600,,250,4.976190476190476
8045895,4,B00078HZ3A,For fans of the ballerina ( one of the greatest ). The choreography is mediocre and the music sounds like Prokieff on an off day. DVD will play on all american machines. Price is right.,1360368000,2,185,4.314285714285714
8045896,5,B00078HZ3A,"This ballet was purchased from Amazon, and since no one has reviewed it yet, I will. I DO own this version of the ballet, and what I shall say, comes after several viewings. I have read reviews on other issues of Anna Karenina, with ballerina/partner Maya Plisetskaya/Alexander Godunov which have not been very complimentary, mostly on grounds of video quality. This issue is a completely Russian version, so it's hard to say who-is-who since I cannot read Russian and all the titles and cast and credits are in the Russian language. This version is an all-region issue and will play on any DVD player. It has good sound, color and the video quality is also quite good. The music, composed by Maya's husband Rodion Shchedrin, is by no means ""Tchaikovsky"" in quality, but still it is quite listenable, especially the music at the racetrack scene, the ballroom scene, and some of the love scenes. Just seeing all the beautiful dresses and gowns made especially for her by Pierre Cardin is worth the cost of the ballet. He made most of her clothes, at very little cost to her because he loved her, pure and simple. There was no hanky-panky between them. He loved her as a ballerina and as a human being, the same reason I love her.

We might consider ourselves lucky to have this ballet at all due to the fact that Maya was harassed on all sides for even considering using the story of Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy as a ballet. The hierarchy of the Bolshoi Theater was afraid to try to use any stories by Tolstoy as subject matter for a ballet for fear of offending family members or the public in general. The author Leo Tolstoy is so revered in Russia, that to even mention his name might offend someone. One other reason we are lucky to be able to see this famous love story is because it is really a FILMED version we are seeing, but the filmed version might never have been completed if Maya had not intervened in Alexander Godunov's plan to defect from the USSR during an American tour (with Maya) before the film had been edited and released. She reminded him that the film would be scrapped if he were to defect. He promised her that he would not defect this time, but the next time they were on tour (to the West) they would defect together. On the next tour, Godunov defected, but Maya did not. She loved her husband Rodion Shchedrin and the Bolshoi stage too much to ever leave them. Also, during the time Anna was being created, there was quite a bit of turmoil occurring at the Bolshoi. Yuri Grigorovich, the ballet director was in charge of everything that went on at the Bolshoi Theater, and he was a very repressive ""boss"" during those years. He gave poor Maya Plisetskaya and her husband Rodion Shchedrin a lot of grief, because Maya (and others) wanted new ballets by new choreographers with different ideas from the ""old"" classics. Grigorovich did not want change. You can easily see this when you look at the works coming out of the Bolshoi from the early 1960s and thirty years thereafter. No new works, no new stage sets, terrible lighting for filmed (taped) ballets coming from the Bolshoi stage. Some of the reviews on this ballet (Anna Karenina) complain of dark scenes where the actors cannot be seen very well, meaning poor lighting.

Another bit of information few people know about; there is another DVD available....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bolshoi-Ballet-67/dp/6305472335/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bolshoi Ballet 67</a>....this DVD purports to tell us about life for the very young Dancers-in-Training at the Bolshoi around the year 1967, and brings in a few of the very famous dancers who have been through the doors of the famous theater including Galina Ulanova, who of course should be mentioned. Another famous ballerina who SHOULD have been mentioned as a contributing member of cast and crew was MAYA PLISETSKAYA, as famous and beloved as any personage who ever graced the stage of the Bolshoi. Along with Galina Ulanova, Maya held the exalted rank of Prima Ballerina Assoluta. Only eight other ballerinas ever held that honor in the entire history of ballet, yet Maya Plisetskaya was not even mentioned in the production called ""Bolshoi Ballet 67"". WHY? Because Yuri Grigorovich (theater director at the time) hated Maya Plisetskaya. The ballet ""Carman Suite"" premiered at the Bolshoi in 1967. Grigorovich had nothing to do with its production, because it was choreographed by the Cuban, Alberto Alonso. (Cuba was supposed to be a friend of Russia remember.) Alberto Alonso was brother or brother-in-law of the famous Cuban Prima Ballerina, Alicia Alonso, (and also one of the ten Prima Ballerina Assolutas in ballet), you would think his credentials would have been high enough, but not for Grigorovich, who rebelled at even the suggestion of another choreographer's work at the Bolshoi. Another thorn in Maya's side was the fact that Grigorovich was married to one of Maya's compeditors, Natalia Bessmertnova, and competitive jealousy on the part of Bessmertnova probably fueled Grigorovich's hatred. Out of pure meanness and spite, Grigorovich had complete video tapes of Maya Plisetskaya's ballet performances ERASED to prevent us from ever seeing them.

Because it was new; because it was being choreographed by Maya; and not being produced under the auspices of Grigorovich, (they were still under the Soviet system of government) Anna Karenina the ballet was almost banned at the Bolshoi. To get more insight into the dirty tricks of Russian Ballet read Maya Plisetskaya's autobiography, ""I, Maya Plisetskaya"".....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Maya-Plisetskaya/dp/0300172478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Maya Plisetskaya</a>....It is a very good history of her, the Bolshoi, and Russian ballet up until 1993, the year of her ""Jubilee"", 50 years on the Bolshoi stage. She danced at her own jubilee celebration, at....get this....SIXTY EIGHT years of age. At this writing, Maya Plisetskaya, born Nov. 20, 1925, is still alive. She is 6 years older than I.",1327190400,11,6085,5.089089089089089
8045897,1,B00078HZ3A,"I watched this video about fifteen years ago. As far as I can remember, there was very little dancing, the biggest attraction being the costumes by Pierre Cardin!!!! Maya was already well past her glorious years.",1009238400,9,212,4.916666666666667
