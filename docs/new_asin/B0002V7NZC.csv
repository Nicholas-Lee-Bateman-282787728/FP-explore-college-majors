8032397,2,B0002V7NZC,"This biography is chock-full of interesting information and especially noted for historic footage; however several long periods of interruption showing nothing more than pictures of film reels, camera lenses, and other film clips having nothing to do with the subject at hand are quite annoying and disruptive to the content.  These many ""fillers"" are a waste of the gift of sight and the time could have been put to much better use by simply showing more still photos of Mother Teresa or her many work settings.  I've seen many other tributes to Mother Teresa and this was my least favorite.  I'd recommend those interested to consider other sources.",1188172800,3,651,5.0092592592592595
8032398,4,B0002V7NZC,"I thought this was a very good documentary on this great saint. However, since i bought it to show a number of year 9 students it was quite boring and not student-friendly. The people who make these documentaries must make them more student/ school friendly. Overall the dvd was a good one.",1168646400,2,290,4.596153846153846
8032399,5,B0002V7NZC,"Excellent overview of a modern saint Mother Teresa's life, espcially the footage of her holding the tiny, abandoned babies in her hands, and her personal caring of the lepers. Mother Teresa's life is a shining example of karma yoga, faith, devotion, unconditional love, compassion, and humility that we can learn and incorporate in our daily lives. I also bought the DVD of Mother Teresa, played by Olivia Hussey, which is also excellent.",1162771200,,438,5.097222222222222
8032400,5,B0002V7NZC,"An excellent example of Biography when the program focused on challenging and intriguing lives - rather than 70s TV stars.  This episode comes from a time when Biography was committed to thoughtful and revealing glimpses into the lives of women and men who slowly changed the world for the better. The production offers numerous interviews of Mother Teresa's contemporaries and fascinating video clips of the woman, both in her labors for the poor and among the world's powerful.  Her unique spirit shines through, including moments when her overwhelming personality was perhaps not easy to take but was still admirably, relentlessly dedicated to her worthy cause.  She was a personal hero of my fiance, Sidelle Rimbaud, who patterned many of her life decisions after Mother Teresa's example of self-sacrifice, and ultimately died in the line of duty. Because of this, I watched the program and was rewarded with a view of one of humanity's most noble spirits.  David R. Bannon, Ph. D.; author ""Race Against Evil.""",1052784000,25,1014,5.127272727272727
