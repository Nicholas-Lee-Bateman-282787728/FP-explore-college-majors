2922889,5,B000UNYJWW,This set is awesome! I relived my youth with this set! This is what you call history! The old school wrestlers doing their best work! This is when wrestling was debated as being real or fake. unlike today when we know it is scripted and choregraphed. The Royal Rumble is still the best PPV of the year along side Wrestlemania!,1280880000,,326,4.45
2922890,5,B000UNYJWW,"This collection of DVDS is great because it has the first set of Royal Rumble events, that came aout in the late 80's and early 90's, it has great matches, but the best part as the box says it's the ROYAL RUMBLE, especially the ones from 1989, 1990, and 1991.
If you were a Hulkamaniac in that period you are going to love this set.

Enjoy.",1233446400,,340,4.151515151515151
2922891,5,B000UNYJWW,"Since 1988, The Royal Rumble has been the second only to WrestleMania as the most important card on the WWE calender. Here is the beginning of that traditon:

Royal Rumble 1988

Ricky Steamboat Vs. ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude (RIP) - A good opener but not the best of either man. Steamboat wins this one on a disqualification.

Leilani Kai/Judy Martin Vs. The Jumping Bomb Angels - Great women's tag team bout for its era! It was contested under 2 out of 3 falls for the now defunct WWF/WWE Women's Tag Team Titles with the JBA's taking the win!

The Royal Rumble Match - This one was only 20 men for this edition with Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart and Tito Santana starting the match. It was ultimately won by ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan.

The Young Stallions Vs. The Islanders - This tag contest was also 2 out of 3 falls with future Umaga along with Haku winning the match in two straight falls.

This one also features the late Dino Bravo's bid to break the world bench press record and the contract signing of then WWE Champion Hulk Hogan against the late Andre The Giant for a match in February 1988.

This one's a must see for historical reasons if nothing else.

Royal Rumble 1989

The number for this RR went up to 30 men and has remained that way ever since. It also had a decent undercard:

""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan & The Hart Foundation Vs. The Rogeuos Brothers & Dino Bravo (2 out of 3 Falls) - This was a good opener which ends when Duggan slugs Bravo from behind with his 2 X 4 during the 3rd fall.

""Ravishing"" Rick Rude/The Ultimate Warrior engaged in a ""Super"" posedown. Personal opinion is that Warrior had the bigger and better body overall but Rude had him beat on abs! LOL! Anyway, it turns into a set up as Rude attacks him after the match which sets up their 6 month long feud.

Rockin' Robin Vs. Judy Martin (WWE Women's Title Match) - Can you say awful?! Judy Martin is another ladies legend in wrestling but Rockin' Robin makes some of the divas of today look like 5 star wrestlers! The best part of the match was at the beginning when ""Sentational"" Sherri Martel (RIP) challenged the winner of the bout. Anyway, Robin takes this one and retains her championship.

Harley Race Vs. Haku (Battle For The Crown) - This one was a slow but decent bout. I wouldn't call it five stars but it did feature one of the stiffest kicks I've ever seen when Haku kicked Race in the face! OUCH! How did Race get up from that afterwards?! I would've still been laying in the ring!

The Royal Rumble match this year featured the then WWE Tag Team Champions Demolition facing each other as numbers 1 and 2! From there, we get interesting action and the foreshadowing of The Megapowers (Hulk Hogan/Randy Savage) exploding in the coming months!

By the way, this one was won by the late Big John Studd!

Royal Rumble 1990

This one is probably one of my favorite Rumble's! Certainly it ties between this one and Rumble '92 on this volume!

The Rougeous Brothers Vs. The Bushwackers - Jacque and Raymond are on the losing end of this fun bout as the former Sheepherders take this one. Not a great tag bout but very fun!

Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake Vs. Lanny ""The Genius"" Poffo - Not a great match but has some entertainment value. Ends in a double DQ and a bad haircut on Poffo but the late, great ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig gets revenge for him when he takes a steel chair to Beefcake's ribs!

Ron Garvin Vs. Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine - This was a submission style match where that was the only way to win! Surprisingly physical especially for this era of WWF/WWE as it was more family friendly than it is now. Garvin wins with his version of the Scorpion/Sharpshooter after nearly submitting earlier to Valentine's figure four leglock.

""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan Vs. The Big Bossman (RIP) - Just a straight fight with almost no wrestling whatsoever! Duggan wins this brawl by DQ when the Bossman decides to use his nightstick. Duggan gets even afterwards with his 2 X 4 to the back of the Bossman and then gives Slick a nice paddling with his trusty board!

The Royal Rumble match was action packed as it featured Ted DiBiase, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, a young Shawn Michaels, Rick Martel, Tito Santana, The Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant, Randy Savage and many others! This one was won by Hogan but more significantly, it set up Hogan's match up with Warrior at WrestleMania VI.

Royal Rumble 1991

The Rockers VS. The Orient Express - Good tag bout to begin things. The Rockers take this one.

The Big Bossman Vs. The Barbarian - A brawling type bout much like his bout with ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan a year before. This time, The Bossman takes the win over the stronger Barbarian.

The Ultimate Warrior Vs. Sgt. Slaughter(WWE Title Match) - While not the greatest match, it may have been one of the more emotional title matches ever due to the Iraqi angle and the real life war that was going on at the time in the Persian Gulf. Ends when ""Macho King"" Randy Savage cost UW the title with his sceptor upside the head, allowing Slaughter to take the win and the title.

Dusty & Dustin Rhodes Vs. Ted Dibiase/Virgil - Not a great bout. Only significant to see Virgil turn on Dibiase after the match.

The Rumble match for this one was okay. It was fun to hear the commentary of the late Gorilla Monsoon and ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper though! Hulk Hogan takes this one after eliminating The Earthquake.

Royal Rumble 1992

The Orient Express Vs. The New Foundation - This was the team of Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart and the late great Owen Hart! They take this one with The Rocket Launcher a la The Midnight Express for the win!

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper Vs. The Mountie (WWE I-C Title Match) - This came on the heels of Bret ""Hitman"" Hart having to drop the title due to a legit illness he had at the time. Only two days into his title reign, The Mountie loses the belt to Piper who (until this point) had never held a title in the WWE! As for the match, it was pretty one-sided as Roddy didn't beat The Mountie.....HE WHIPPED THAT BOOTY THEN SENT HIM TO DREAMLAND WITH THE SLEEPERHOLD!

The Beverly Brothers Vs. The Bushwackers - More of a comedy thing with The Bushwackers' sidekick Jamison and The Beverly's manager ""The Genius"" Lanny Poffo than a real match. The Beverly's take this one but Jamison gets some revenge on ""The Genius.""

The Legion Of Doom Vs. The Natural Disasters (WWE World Tag Team Title Match) - The LOD carried much of this one as they made the late Earthquake and Typhoon look really formidable while still making themselves look good. TND wins by countout but LOD retains the titles in this one.

The Royal Rumble 1992 is special for two reasons: 1. It is the first and only time (to date) that the WWE title has been put up for grabs in this and 2. the now retired ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair set a precident of an early draw winning this event (he went in at #3) by lasting an hour to win the title!

See Ric Flair face off with new enemies (at the time) such as the late British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith, a young Shawn Michaels, The Big Bossman, Tito Santana and The Undertaker. He also faces some old ones from his past such as Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, Rick Martel, the late ""Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine and many more! Of course, he faces off with Hulk Hogan in this and, to their credit, WWE left in the parts where Hulk was actually booed when he faced off with Sid (Vicious) Justice! They were originally edited out after the original PPV feed but now they've been put back!

While all the volumes I've seen have value, if I had to recommend one, it would be this one just for the nostalgic value alone!

Worth the $30 plus dollars!",1212969600,2,7689,4.458630527817403
2922892,5,B000UNYJWW,"The Royal Rumble has always been my favorite PPV that the WWE (WWF) puts on.  It's always been such a unique match and the PPVs generally have a solid under-card as well.  What makes these early Royal Rumbles even better is the fact that with so many entries, you get to see pretty much every wrestler on the roster.  So no matter who liked 20 years go in the WWF(E), chances are good he'll show-up some place on here.

1988 - The first Rumble, and (shockingly) this is a really good show.  The infamous angle when Dino Bravo ""set"" the world bench-press record is here along with a Rick Rude/Ricky Steamboat less-than-classic (but still good), and a 2 out 3 fall women's tag title match.  The Andre ""The Giant""/Hulk Hogan contract signing comes off as something that you would see on Raw (not shocking since this Rumble was actually on USA, not PPV).  The Rumble only features 20 wrestlers, but was very solid especially when you consider this had never been done before.  The show ends with The Islanders taking on The Young Stallions in another 2 out 3 falls match.  In sort of an awkward moment after the first fall, when they cut away from the match and have an interview with The Giant as The Islanders just stand in the ring in the background waiting for the match to continue.

1989 - The Rumble's first PPV appearance.  The card starts out with a 6 man tag 2 out of 3 falls match (for those keeping track at home - this is the 4th regular match to appear on a Royal Rumble dating back to last year and 3 of the 4 have been tag team 2 out of 3 falls matches).  This one features Hacksaw and The Hart Foundation taking on Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers.  Then we get the ultra-amazing ""Super Pose Down"" between Rude and the Ultimate Warrior (sure the Pose Down was insanely corny, but this type of thing totally summed up the WWE back then).  A women's title match and a weird heal vs. heal showdown between Harley Race and Haku over the ""king"" title conclude the under card.  The Rumble itself was great - the WWE clearly had a much better idea on how to pull this off and it showed.  By the way, on all of these Rumbles we get the original interviews with the wrestlers - it's almost worth the price right there to see those.

1990 - Another solid Rumble.  The best match on the under-card was a surprisingly decent ""submission"" match between Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine and ""Rugged"" Ronnie Garvin.  There's also a Brother Love segment, Brutus ""The Barber' Beefcake takes on The Genius, and Hacksaw/Big Boss Man match.  The Royal Rumble itself was again good.  The most notable moment is when Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior squared off briefly (setting the stage for Wrestlemania 6).  Also, a very young (and very skinny) Tony Schiavone is the play-by-play man.

1991 - This is probably my favorite Royal Rumble on this set.  Lots of exciting things happening - The Mountie debuts (I guess that's exciting), Virgil leaves DiBiase, Warrior loses the title to Sgt. Slaughter, and a great Rockers/Orient Express match.  The wrestlers have the Rumble match down to a science at this point.  The only drawback is Jesse ""The Body"" is no longer the color commentator and Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan hasn't taken over yet, so we are stuck with Piper (who's ok, but not nearly as good as the other two).

1992 - This is one of the more famous Rumble matches due to the fact that the winner is named the WWE Champion.  The Rumble match is exciting, but the other matches are just brutal.  We have three tag matches (none of which are classics) and a short Intercontinental Title match pitting The Mountie (who, apparently, had just won the title two days before) against ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper.

Overall this set is a great buy - the price is cheap, and you get hours of memories and entertainment.",1209168000,,3799,4.527859237536657
2922893,5,B000UNYJWW,"This set goes back to the infancy of the WWE.  It has all of the early characters and shows how far the organization has progressed.  Well worth the money for the nostalgia and the true fan base.  A ""must have"" for the WWE historians.  I highly recommend all 4 volumes.",1205107200,,269,4.32
2922894,5,B000UNYJWW,"1988- Glad this was here!!! It's the first Rumble that aired as a USA Network Special and it had that feel with Dino Bravo going for the benchpress mark, and Vince must've had been in love with 2 out of three falls matches as you get two here, one for the Women's Tag Titles between the Glamour Girls and The ""Awesome"" Jumping Bomb Angels, the other was a squash between The Islanders and Young Stallions. Event notable for The Hogan-Andre contract signing that led to the disputed title and the disaster that was Wrestlemania IV, and Hacksaw Jim Duggan winning the first 20 man Rumble.

1989- First Rumble on PPV, also the only one done by the Gorilla and The Body together. Includes a battle for the King of the World Wrestling Federation, a womens title match, and another two/three falls match. Look out for the intros from Vince in 89 and 90, it's really funny to listen as he tries to make The Warlord a series threat to win the event.

1990- My favorite of the volume, I still have All American Boys floating through my head from the Bushwhacker-Rouegau Brother match. Also Notable for the Submission Match between Garvin and Valintine, Perfect using a chair on Brutus the Barber (back when chair use wasn't in nearly every match), and The Hogan-Warrior Rumble Staredown.

1991- During the Gulf War, Sgt. Slaughter turns heel to fight The Ultimate Warrior, who was probably reeling from his attempted seduction by Scary Sherri, good Rockers vs. Orient Express opener, and The Rumble blew off The Hulkster-Quake fued. Watch out for Piper on commentary and keep the volume low.

1992- The WWE Title is on the line in The Royal Rumble also available on Flair's first WWE DVD, Roddy Piper wins the Intercontinental Title and zaps The Mountie, another Bushwacker comedy match vs. The Beverley Sisters and the Monsoon-Heenen Rumble Commentary is priceless.",1205107200,2,1857,4.8119122257053295

2922897,4,B000UNYJWW,"I was very excited to hear that WWE was releasing the Royal Rumble Anthology series in 4 separate volumes and not just as one big collection, just like they did with the all the Wrestlemainas. And this first volume, which includes the first 5 Royal Rumbles from 1988-1992, are arguably the best out  of the whole Royal Rumble series. Of course, the main attraction here are the Royal Rumble matches themselves, but there are actually some really good other matches that take place as well.
  And though the first Royal Rumble was decent, I have to say its the weakest one here. First off, their were only 20 participants in the original Rumble, not 30, and not featuring Hogan and Andre. I kinda felt that this first Rumble lacked star power,(the Ultimate Warrior is in this one, but gets eliminated way too easily!)And the winner of the rumble was somewhat disappointing to me. Not to mention, there are only 3 other matches that take place here, one being a woman's tag team championship match, which I fast-forwarded through about 2 minutes into the match!
 The 1989 Royal Rumble was improved compared to the first, with the addition of 30 WWF superstars, rather than 20. It also included a much better array of wrestling talent with most of the best the sport had to offer like Andre, Hogan, Jake Roberts, Perfect, Macho Man, and Ted DiDiase. This Rumble is great, however,I was once again somewhat disappointed in the winner. Once again, only 3 other matches are included, one of them being a women's Championship Match, which, once again, I fast-forwarded through! Not to mention, the Super Posedown between Rude and Warrior was kinda stupid as well.
  The 1990 Royal Rumble is easily my all-time favorite Rumble. Though I didn't like it when wrestlers come in and clear out the ring. The more people in the ring, the more entertaining it is to me. This is one reason some of the later Rumbles weren't as good. This rumble has all the greats in it: Hogan, Andre, Dibiase, Piper, Macho Man, Jake Roberts, Warrior, and the list goes on. The talent in this one is really what makes this one the best Rumble out of the entire series. And besides the first match between The Bushwhackers and the Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, there are a couple of good matches here, included the surprisingly great Submission match between Greg Valentine and Ronnie Garvin.
  The 1991 Rumble is pretty much on par with the previous Rumble, but just not quite as good. There is no Andre, Rick Rude, or Piper in it. And Dibiase is in a Royal Rumble tag team match, he's not in the Rumble itself. However, this marks the first appearance of the Undertaker in a Royal Rumble. And though the Rumble is good, I didn't care for the ending. It just felt too scripted, and just wasn't that impressive-looking. This rumble contains the notorious Sgt. Slaughter vs Ultimate Warrior match, in which the Warrior would lose the Championship belt. But my biggest complaint with this one is the commentary by Roddy Piper who's with Gorilla Monsoon. I usually like Piper as a commentator, he's just way over the top here, and the whole event itself somewhat suffer because of it.
 The last Royal Rumble in this volume once again contains some of the all-time greats in the business, including for the first time, Ric Flair. And there are some good matches, like the Intercontinental Championship Match between The Mountie and Roddy Piper (who also appears in the Rumble), and the Tag Team Championship Match  with Legion of Doom vs The Natural Disasters. Overall, this is a good Rumble match with a good ending. Though I gotta say I was pissed that Dibiase got eliminated so early!!
  As far as packaging, there's nothing too impressive with this, but a word to the warning, if you wanna be surprised with not knowing who's coming out when, don't look too closely inside this set because it contains the a list of order of entry of each Rumble participant, as well as the superstar who stayed in the longest and who had the most eliminations!! Overall, if you like classic wresting, when it was actually worth watching, then this is a must have. Yeah, there are so crappy matches now and again and some stupid storylines, but this is wrestling, what can you expect? And like I said, this is a much better product that what Vince is putting out there now. This Royal Rumble Volume has all the all-time great wrestling characters in their prime. Again, this is a must have for real wrestling fans, and at this price, its a steal.",1196726400,14,4492,4.693773824650572
2922898,4,B000UNYJWW,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS IN 2014

1988 - The beginning of a tradition here as this was the first Rumble in WWF history as a special on USA network from the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada which long time fans remember was an attempt to take an audience away the NWA ""Bunkhouse Stampede"" PPV that same night.  This Rumble only featured 20 men before going to the traditional number of 30. The other main attraction on this card was the contract signing for the rematch between WWE Champion Hulk Hogan & Andre The Giant for ""The Main Event"" broadcast the next month with the difference this time being Ted Dibiase & Virgil being in Andre's corner.  Other matches include Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude, Dino Bravo attempting a new bench press record, two sets of 2 out of 3 falls matches featuring a rare title defense of the Womens Tag Team Championship between the Jumping Bomb Angles & Glamour Girls along with Young Stallions vs. Islanders.  It should be noted that this entire event had never been released in full on either DVD or VHS prior to this anthology.

1989 - The edition of the Rumble came from from The Summit in Houston, TX was the first time the event became the now yearly PPV event which also marked the Rumble debut for such superstars as Sensational Sherri, Ted Dibiase & Virgil, Ax & Smash of Demolition, Mr. Perfect, Ronnie Garvin, Greg Valentine, Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty of The Rockers, Luke & Butch of The Bushwackers, Honky Tonk Man, Randy Savage, Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard of The Brain Busters, Big Boss Man, Brutus Beekcake, and Rick Martel.  The Rumble match went to the traditional format of 30 men instead of the previous 20 which featured such highlights as who drew the first two numbers, a record set that would last for 20 years, how the odds on favorite ended up eliminating himself, the interaction of the Mega Powers during the match, and the story going on all night behind Ted Dibiase's entry number.  Other matches include Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude in a ""Super Posedown"" bodybuilding contest, Haku vs. Harley Race in a match to determine the ""King Of Wrestling"" with Bobby Heenan representing both men, Womens Champion Rockin' Robin vs. Judy Martin with Sensational Sherri on commentary, and a two out of three falls six man tag match with Jim Duggan & Hart Foundation vs. Fabulous Rougeaus & Dino Bravo.

1990 - The first Rumble of the new decade occurred at the Orlando Arena in Orlando, FL featuring the Rumble debuts of such superstars as Tony Schiavone, Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Earthquake, and Dusty Rhodes.  This Rumble match included such highlights as the top two names & champions in the WWE at that time going face to face for the first time, Ted Dibiase's entry number & the irony of it when compared to last year, and up to five men eliminating one.  Other matches include Jim Duggan vs. Big Boss Man, Ronnie Garvin vs. Greg Valentine in a submission match, Brutus Beefcake vs. The Genius, Bushwackers vs. Fabulous Rougeaus, and The Brother Love Show with Sapphire & Sensational Queen Sherri.

1991 - The Rumble this year once again took place in the state of Flordia but this time in Miami at the Miami Arena featuring the Rumble debuts of superstars such as Sgt. Slaughter, Dustin Rhodes, Kerry Von Erich, Tony ""Saba Simba"" Atlas, Undertaker, Davey Boy Smith, Hawk & Animal of Legion Of Doom, Shane Douglas, Crush, and Brian Knobbs of Nasty Boys.  This Rumble featured more new faces than the previous years but was your typical battle royal with the big highlight coming down to who were the final two as they had months long history against each other with the winner making Rumble history.  The WWE Championship was defended for the first time in Rumble history with Ultimate Warrior defending against Sgt. Slaughter who recently returned to WWE as an Iraqi sympathizer during this time the Gulf War was going on with Warrior's actions earlier in the night based off a challenged issued to him coming back to haunt him in more ways than one.  Other matches include Dusty & Dustin Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase & Virgil with Dibiase & Virgil constantly having miscommunication against each other throughout the entire match to the point where Dibiase got a response after the match that he never got before, Big Boss Man continuing to battle The Heenan Family members one by one vs. Barbarian, Rockers vs. Orient Express, and Mountie vs. Koko B. Ware.

1992 - This edition of the Rumble took place at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, NY featuring the Rumble debuts of superstars such as Owen Hart, Jerry Sags of Nasty Boys, I.R.S., and Sid Justice.  The winner of the Royal Rumble match became the WWE Champion For the first (and so far last) time in history leading to such highlights as a new record set for the longest time, the debut of Shawn Michaels new persona that we would later refer to as ""The Heartbreak Kid"", the confrontations between Randy Savage & Jake Roberts along with Ric Flair & Roddy Piper, the final three, and Bobby Heenan reacting the everything & everyone around Flair throughout the entire match leading to some very comedic moments on commentary.  Other matches include Roddy Piper attempting to make history by winning two championships on the same night against Intercontinental Champion The Mountie, Tag Team Champions Legion Of Doom vs. Natural Disasters, Bushwhackers vs. Beverly Brothers, and New Foundation vs. Orient Express.",1188000000,24,5439,4.793803418803419

Or experience them for the first time.... This is a 5 disc set from the WWF era of the WWE. It has the first 5 Royal Rumbles (1988-1992). The first one was not a Pay-Per-View event. It was a special on TV & would only have 20 wrestlers. 1989-1992 are Pay-Per-View events w/ 30 wrestlers in those Royal Rumbles. There are some really cool matches aside from the rumbles themselves. And this anthology has pretty much all the legendary wrestlers from the 80's-90's. My son and I, and even my girlfriend, have been watching these & loving it! I grew up watching these wrestlers in the 80's-90's. And remember watching many of these events when they we're happening. My favorite Royal Rumble of this set is the 1992 Royal Rumble.

2922915,5,B000UNYJWW,"Im not going to bore you with each year and match. If the late 80s and early 90s are your favorate era then you have got to get this anthology. I was between 8 and 12 years old during this time. Watching these royal rumble events again makes me feel like a kid again. This was the true golden age of WWF. It definatly had the most memerable wrestlers and gimmics. Today the WWE seems so serious. Also today you have a pay per view every mounth. Back in the late 80s, early 90s time you only had 4 pay per views, royal rumble, wrestlmania, summerslam, and survivor series, so there was a 3 mounth build up to each event and that made them so much more special. If you love this era you have to get this anthology, along with wrestlmania, summerslam, and survivor series anthologys. To me these a priceless treasure chest of memories. Another thing unlike the wrestlmania anthologys all of the wrestlers original theme song are perfectly intact and not edited. Awsome!",1329004800,,966,4.494318181818182
2922916,5,B000UNYJWW,"1988-The First Rumble ever was actually broadcast as a 2 and a half hour special on the USA Network and its only noteworthy cause its the first ever one as none of the matches are too special, but none are really horrible.

-""Ravishing"" Rick Rude vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat: A few years later these two would have a great, great series of matches in WCW, but this contest certainly is a good display of great chemistry mixed with great wrestling. Steamboat worked on Rude's arm, even lifting him to the air and slamming him back down, then a couple of the classic Steamboat arm drags. Rude works on Ricky's back and neck with a reverse chin lock. Rude pulls the ref in front of Steamboat and after he recovers he DQ's Rude. 7/10.

-Next we have Dino Bravo trying to break a power lifting record, which is a pretty boring segment honestly.

-Two out of Three Falls Match for the Women's Tag Team Championship, The Glamour Girls (Champions) w/Jimmy Hart vs. The Jumping Bomb Angels: Here's a decent to good contest featuring some women who can actually wrestle though the Angels really do shine in this one. After an alley-oop the Glamour Girls take the first fall. One Angel hits a sunset flip a few minutes later and its one fall apiece. In the third fall both Angels hit a double dropkick off the top rope and make the cover to win the titles. 7/10.

-Now we have the contract signing for Hulk Hogan/Andre The Giant at the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event, the history of this rivalry was shown through various well done video packages. The contract signing itself felt pretty big but it did go on a little long, it does expectedly end with Andre slamming Hulk's head on the table and throwing the table on him.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Bret Hart is #1 and Tito Santana is #2 and unlike future rumbles this one would only have 20 men. Its nothing too memorable, though Santana does have a decent showing as does Hart. The Ultimate Warrior does make an appearance though its nothing too noteworthy. Hacksaw Jim Duggan ends up taking this one to become the first winner in the Rumble's history.

-We have an interview with Hogan where he talks about how he's ready to take on and destroy Andre The Giant.

-Two out of Three Falls, The Islanders vs. The Young Stallions: This isn't a bad match, though Paul Roma was never much of a worker. Haku pulls down the rope and Roma hits the mat on the outside hard, the ref counts Roma out and the Islanders take the first fall. Then we have a promo from Andre about the upcoming match with Hogan and the match is resumed. The Islanders target Roma's knee and after a top rope splash on the knee, Haku locks on a single leg boston crab to take the match in two straight falls.

Since its the first its worth watching but not really more than one viewing is needed.

1989: Better than the previous Rumble, as the matches had a better flow to them and any time u have Gorilla Monsoon on commentary its elevates the matches and segments.

-Two out of Three Falls Match, Dino Bravo & The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers vs. Hacksaw Jim Duggan & The Hart Foundation: The crowd was hot throughout the match and all of these guys worked very well. Nice triple team battering ram by Duggan's team, a bit later the Rougeau's hit a doomsday device type move and cover Bret to win the first fall. The Rougeau's and Dino do team up on Bret to start the second fall but he won't quit. Hacksaw nails an elbow on Ramone to even the match at one fall apiece. After a couple of minutes Hacksaw nails Dino with the 2x4 and Bret covers him to win the third fall and the match. 8/10.

-There's some pre-recorded segments where the superstars pick their numbers, a decent segment here.

-The Super Pose Down, Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude: Its a segment not a match and its funny mainly cause of Warrior's antics and this would lead to their match at Wrestlemania V a couple of months later. Since its the people's choice, Warrior of course gets the win, but Rude nails him with a steel bar and chokes him out with it and leaves the ring. Nice post segment where Warrior takes out a few officials and runs to the back to get his revenge.

-Women's Championship Match, Rockin' Robin (Champion) vs. Judy Martin: Right before Sensational Sherri makes a challenge to the winner and then the match begins, which isn't a bad one, there's some good moves by both women, though the crowd didn't seem to care. Robin hits a splash from the second rope for the win to retain her title. 5/10.

-More superstar promos hyping them being in and winning the Rumble.

-King Haku vs. Harley Race: Haku gets dumped out of his throne by Race before the match and this is basically a brawl in and out of the ring. Its not a bad match, Race does help elevate the younger Haku and it was kinda sad to see the former NWA champ at this stage of his career, though he did get some good moves in. Haku ducks a clothesline and hits a reverse thrust kick and makes the cover to win. 6/10.

-Even more superstars talking about how they will win the Rumble including Hulk Hogan.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Ax is #1 and Smash is #2, which is a good way to start it out. When Andre The Giant came in at #3, he stayed in the ring for a good while and eliminated a few men including Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts. Soon after Roberts comes back to the ring with his snake and Andre is so terrified he goes over the top rope eliminating himself. There is the expected face off between the Mega Powers, Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage which leads to Hogan's exit from the match. The winner was #27 Big John Studd, which to me was pretty lame as Studd was never really a huge draw or any kind of fan favorite during his WWE career, in my opinion at least. I mean just a couple months later he was reduced to being a special guest referee in a match at Wrestlemania, so his victory was kinda forgotten it seemed. Not a bad rumble though.

-1990: People were excited to see this Rumble and with the face off between Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior it didn't disappoint as the main event.

-The Faboulous Rougeau Brothers vs, The Bushwackers: We have the usual antics of the Bushwackers while the Rougeaus keep it wrestling based and they cut off the ring. After the Bushwackers hit the battering ram Butch makes the cover on Jacques for the win. 6/10.

-We hear from Ted DiBiase who was #30 last year and is #1 this year.

-The Genius vs. Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake: Ok this match has two gimmicks that were honest to god pretty horrible even for this era. Its not really a good match as no one believed the Genius was anything other than a goof cause of his poetry he did before his matches. After the ref gets knocked out of the ring, Brutus slaps on the sleeper hold and then goes to cutting some of the Genius' hair. Mr. Perfect comes in and hits the perfect-plex and the ref comes to and calls for the DQ on both men. 4/10.

-The Heenan famliy is backstage talking about which one of them will win the Rumble, fun little interview.

-Submission Match, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine vs. ""Rugged"" Ronnie Garvin: Given how both of these men are stiff workers there are some hard shots in this match, but when each man keeps going for pinfalls instead of submissions it brings the match down a bit. Both men go after the other's legs throughout the match with some leg locks and Garvin locks on a sharpshooter and Hammer gives up. 6/10.

-Mr. Perfect is interviewed and he talks about how he's tired of Brutus Beefcake's constant hair cuts on the superstars he puts to sleep.

-Brother Love interviews both Sensational Sherri and Sapphire, which would lead to their involvement in the mixed tag match at Wrestlemania VI.

-Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. The Big Bossman: This was a straight up brawl in the ring, Duggan was his usual goofy self though he did use some good moves on the Bossman, who showed some suprising agility for a big man. Bossman uses the nightstick on Duggan but the ref sees it and calls for the DQ. 5/10. Nice post match where Duggan uses his 2x4 on Bossman and his manager Slick to get a measure of revenge.

-More promos from various wrestlers involved in the Rumble including Earthquake, Demolition, Dusty Rhodes and others.

-The Royal Rumble Match: ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase is #1, Koko B. Ware is #2 and this was a Rumble that is remembered for a couple of reasons. One is how DiBiase lasted over 40 minutes which was an amazing feat in itself and two was the showdown between Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior which had the fans on their feet. This one actually helped build a few of the matches on the Wrestlemania VI card, Hogan/Warrior, Rhodes/Savage, Piper/Brown among others. Hogan ends up eliminating #30 Mr. Perfect to win the Rumble. Its a good one for sure.

1991

-The Orient Express vs. The Rockers: Great opening match as both teams worked very well together. The Rockers hit some nice double team moves including dueling suicide dives to the outside. The Express does isolate Michaels and works him over for a few minutes before the tag to Jannetty who after a few minutes hits a sunset flip and makes the cover for the win. 8/10.

-Sean Mooney interviews ""Macho King"" Randy Savage who basically says he's next in line for a title shot. We then go to the arena where Queen Sherri asks the Ultimate Warrior to grant Savage a title shot, in typical Warrior fashion he turns her down, which enrages Savage who comes down after Warrior walked away.

-The Barbarian vs. The Big Bossman: This was during the time when Bossman was going after the Heenan family for comments the Brain had said about Bossman's mom. Its a decent big man vs. big man match as both do display some agility and there are some hard hitting moves by both. Barbarian hits a splash off the top rope but Bossman rolls through and covers him for the 3 count. 6/10.

-Sergant Slaughter is backstage with the General and he talks about how he will defeat the Ultimate Warrior and unleash a new reign of terror on the WWE. Also an interview with Warrior where he says he will turn back Slaughter's challenge.

-WWE Championship Match, The Ultimate Warrior (Champion) vs. Sergant Slaughter: Quite a good match here as the Gulf War was going on during this time so WWE capitalized on it by turning Slaughter heel and siding him with Iraq. As for the match, it started in typical Warrior fashion as he took it too both the General and Slaughter early on. Sherri does come down, Warrior chases her and Savage blind sides him. Back in the ring Slaughter takes it to Warrior but can't keep him down. Later Savage cracks his sceptre over Warriors head, Slaughter makes the cover and wins the title much to the announcer's and the crowd's shock. 8/10.

-Koko B. Ware vs. The Mountie: Pretty much filler here, Koko gets in some good moves and almost has the Mountie beat but Mountie hits a swinging slam and picks up the win. 4/10.

-Randy Savage and Sherri are in the back being interviewed about what he did to the Warrior during the title match. They run off when Warrior starts pounding on the locker room door.

-Slaughter is interviewed saying he told everyone he would win the title and he did it.

-Some superstars talk about how they will win this Rumble, including Jake Roberts, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine, Kerry Von Erich, The Road Warriors and others.

-Dusty & Dustin Rhodes vs. ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase & Virgil: What this was about is could Dustin hang in the ring with a veteran and the growing tension between Virgil and DiBiase. Its not a bad tag team match, though Dusty was near the end of his career, Dustin did hold his own and there was the expected miscue between Virgil and DiBiase that led to Ted beating up his bodyguard. Dusty gets rolled up and DiBiase makes the cover to win. 6/10. The aftermath is great where Virgil was basically forced to give the Million Dollar Belt to his boss, but he ended up nailing DiBiase with the belt, knocking him out and Virgil left the ring to a massive ovation.

-Hulk Hogan is interviewed and says he will win the Rumble against all odds and he will go on to face Slaughter for the title.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Bret Hart is #1 and Dino Bravo is #2, this isn't a bad rumble match Bret has a good showing but the real star was Rick Martel as he lasted 52 minutes and almost won the thing. Hogan had his usual good showing as everyone knew he would win, there was the face/off between Hogan & Earthquake as Hogan got his revenge on the man who put him out of action for months in the previous year. They actually have a decent match of their own as they are the final two and Hogan ends up throwing the big man over the top rope to win the Rumble. A good one here.

1992

-The Orient Express vs. The New Foundation: A good opener here though the Express/Rockers match from the previous year was much better to me. We got plenty of good double teaming from all the guys involved and The Foundation uses the Midnight Express' rocket launcher to make the cover and win this hard fought match. 6/10.

-Lord Alfred Hayes Recaps how Bret Hard lost the Intercontinental Championship to the Mountie two days prior to this match.

-The Mountie is interviewed and basically says regardless of how he won the title he will keep it for a long time and beat Roddy Piper.

-Intercontinental Championship Match, The Mountie (Champion) vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper: Bobby Heenan pointed out early on that Piper had never held a title in the WWE, so that combined with how The Mountie won the title two days prior you just knew Piper was gonna win. It was quite one sided, Mountie didn't get in a lot of moves and Piper slapped on the sleeperhold and Mountie passes out which gives Piper the win and the title. 6/10.

-Lord Alfred Hayes interviews Hulk Hogan who says in no certain words he will win the rumble and become the Undisputed Champion.

-The Beverly Brothers w/The Genius vs. The Bushwackers w/Jamison: Purely comedic garbage filler here, there's nothing really of note but it is at least over quick with The Beverly's winning and Jamison getting in some shots on the Genius. 3/10. Side note Bobby Heenan's commentary was gold during this.

-World Tag Team Championship Match, The Legion of Doom (Champions) vs. The Natural Disasters: Power for power here as the LOD are the smaller of two teams which was rare in their matches. Its not a bad match, good double teaming by both teams, but the countout finish does bring it down a bit, where the Disasters win but LOD retains the titles. 6/10.

-The Natural Disasters are interviewed as say they should be the champions.

-Shawn Michaels talks about how he is going solo and will win the Rumble.

-Lord Alfred Hayes interviews Ric Flair who says he will prove he's the real world's champion.

-We also get some promos from other Rumble entrants who all want to win and become the champion.

-The Royal Rumble Match: The British Bulldog is #1 and ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase is #2 and this has been called one of if not the greatest Rumble in history and with good reason as its very start studded. Bulldog, Piper (who wrestled earlier) and Shawn Michaels had good showings, but the real star of this rumble is Ric Flair who entered #3 and survived 60 minutes and tossed out the Immortal Hulk Hogan to win the Undisputed Championship. Great, great rumble here. Side note: Bobby Heenan and Gorilla Monsoon's commentary made this match even better. Also I do like how the aftermath was included with Hogan and Sid Justice facing off with the fans booing Hogan when he did his trademark poses.

This is a good set to get mainly for nostalgic purposes, the '90-'92 Rumbles are worth watching straight through even with a couple of underwhelming under card matches.",1314662400,3,15758,4.49859943977591
2922917,4,B000UNYJWW,"I loved it so much. Seeing The first Royal Rumble was Great because there was more than 20 years after the first one. If you haven't seen any of the The Royal Rumble Anthologys or any Royal Rumbles, you will love it so much. Peace!",1314316800,,231,4.155555555555556
2922918,5,B000UNYJWW,"I'm so glad WWE has finally released the Royal Rumble series on DVD. Well, let's get to them.

I'm only reviewing what I have seen.

Royal Rumble 1988

Ricky Steamboat Vs. ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude (RIP) - While I enjoyed this bout, both men definitely had better matches.

Leilani Kai/Judy Martin Vs. The Jumping Bomb Angels

The Royal Rumble Match - This one was only 20 men for this edition with Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart and Tito Santana starting the match. It was ultimately won by ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan.

The Young Stallions Vs. The Islanders

This event also featured 2 non wrestling segments:

Dino Bravo's bench press and the contract signing between Hulk & Andre.

While not one of my favorites, I found the contract signing memorable. It's recommended as it's part of rich history.

Royal Rumble 1989

""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan & The Hart Foundation Vs. The Rogeuos Brothers & Dino Bravo (2 out of 3 Falls) - Good opener. All men worked hard.

""Ravishing"" Rick Rude/The Ultimate Warrior engaged in a ""Super"" posedown- I don't know who was right to win this & I personally never cared for pose downs.

Rockin' Robin Vs. Judy Martin (WWE Women's Title Match)

Harley Race Vs. Haku (Battle For The Crown)

This was the first time the Royal Rumble match had 30 men & it was that way till 2011. Some notable moments: the then WWE Tag Team Champions Demolition facing each other as numbers 1 and 2,  the end of The Megapowers (Hulk Hogan/Randy Savage) & the beginning of their eventual explosion leading to their WM5 showdown!

Royal Rumble 1990

The Rougeous Brothers Vs. The Bushwackers

Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake Vs. Lanny ""The Genius"" Poffo

Ron Garvin Vs. Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine

""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan Vs. The Big Bossman (RIP)

A great Royal Rumble match that was action packed. Names such as Ted DiBiase, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, a noticeably young Shawn Michaels, Rick Martel, Tito Santana, The Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant (who I could tell was not the same man he was as his health problems caught or were catching up to him), and Randy Savage (The Macho King era) Everyone was waiting for the Warrior/Hogan confrontation & it was just a little preview of their memorable WM6 match. I wished their Rumble confrontation was longer & it should've been just those 2 alone in the ring for a while.

Royal Rumble 1991

The Rockers VS. The Orient Express - A great tag team match IMO.

The Big Bossman Vs. The Barbarian

The Ultimate Warrior Vs. Sgt. Slaughter(WWE Title Match - Warrior lost thanks to a memorable attack by Randy Savage, wo was irate that Warrior said no to Sherri earlier in the night.

Dusty & Dustin Rhodes Vs. Ted Dibiase/Virgil - The aftermath is more memorable than the match itself. It was something that was teased for a while & everyone finally got what they waited for.

The Undertaker made his debut in this year's Rumble match. But while he was an imposing and dominating force, he was not the man he was till he was paired with Paul Bearer. Honestly, that was the real highlight for me, other than Jake Roberts getting Rick Martel.

Also, something that was missing from the 1994 Rumble DVD, the pre-match comments were included & they were good.

Royal Rumble 1992

The Orient Express Vs. The New Foundation - Great match. But I enjoyed the Rockers/Orient Express from the previous year a bit more. What would've been nice if they were added to make it a 3 way.

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper Vs. The Mountie (WWE I-C Title Match) - I think this was the first time Roddy won a singles Title & the I.C. Title was the only singles Title or only Title ever that he held I believe.

The Beverly Brothers Vs. The Bushwackers

The Legion Of Doom Vs. The Natural Disasters (WWE World Tag Team Title Match) - While I love both teams, I couldn't get into this for some reason. LOD really carried their opponents.

Just like the 1991 dvd, the 1992 dvd also featured what was IMO, a much more better & memorable pre-match comments from Macho Man (""OH YEAH! The Royal Rumble. The single greatest wrestling event & match EVER in the history of the World Wrestling Federation. Competition, yeah, against the greatest wrestlers in the world. And only ONE MAN can win the prestigious World Wrestling Federation Championship belt. I've won it before. I;ve been there before. I'VE BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN! And I'm goin back. I;m goin back this afternoon. Two things I wanna accomplish this afternoon, yeah. NUMBER ONE, sometime I wanna get my hands on the Snake Man & the other thing is, yeah, I WANNA ONCE AGAIN BE THE WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION CHAMPION! OH YEAH! DIG IT!"") , Sid (""You are lookin at the next World Wrestling Federation Champion. You are looking at Sid Justice.""), Repo Man (Cause remember, what;s mine is mine and what's yours in mine too."") (Repo Man was known as Demolition Smash the years before 1992), Jake Roberts (They say you can't always get you want. But I've always been able to get what I need."") Bulldog, Flair (""For me, there is no back door!""), Taker (""And standing atop this mass carnage will be The Undertaker crowned once more World Wrestling Federation heavyweight Champion.""), and Hogan.

The 1992 Royal Rumble was one of my most favorites! IMO, Taker had a better showing here. He should've won since he was really screwed out of his first Title reign & never got a rightful one on one match, something Hogan DID have just 6 days later. Taker should've went after Tunney for that! The least they could've done is have Hogan enter BEFORE Taker and/or have Taker eliminate him. You have to see Macho Man's sprint to the ring & Flair's emotional interview after the match! Another WM match was set up here at the end. This was special since it's the only time the WWF Title was on the line. Since Taker, Hogan & Flair were the main parts of the Title picture, they should have been the last 3.
