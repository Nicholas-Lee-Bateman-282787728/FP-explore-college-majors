2054971,1,B0002235QC,Pitiful acting throughout. I regret watching this video for as long as I did. I hoped that the acting would get better. It did not.,1400630400,,131,4.28
2054972,2,B0002235QC,Not worth the view in my opinion. With so many other movies available I suggest skipping this. The plot is not cohesive. The writing was altogether poor.,1398988800,,153,4.703703703703703
2054973,1,B0002235QC,I turned this off after ten minutes. Dont waste your time with this movie it is really old and not funny.,1397088000,,105,4.0476190476190474
2054974,3,B0002235QC,"Good cast of characters, plus a young Bill Pullman.  Nothing new story wise, but an interesting twist involving a show horse.  Overall I thought it was pretty funny.",1395619200,,165,4.857142857142857
2054975,3,B0002235QC,"I bought this sight-unseen, mainly to see beautiful Sally Kirkland.  I can't comment honestly beyond the first half-hour because I became bored with the acting and slow plot. The quality of the transfer looks okay, with the exception of a moment when Maureen and what's his name are leaving a building.  There's an audible glitch.  Also a moment of white spots elsewhere.  First time I've seen something like this.",1370822400,,414,4.956521739130435
2054976,5,B0002235QC,"What a lovely movie.  So much of the interactions between the leads and between the leads and their other relationships is like a real relationship. There are a few silly lines but what a pleasure it was to watch the movie. The secondary characters are physically more attractive than the leads but of course there is a cerebral quality to the relationship between the leads whereas the more attractive secondary characters are never cerebral at all which draws the leads together.

 Todd Rungren's soundtrack is great when paired with the movie.",1366156800,2,546,4.978021978021978
2054977,4,B0002235QC,"don't know if the movie will play or not . i haven't gotten around to try it. i am waiting for the right time and mood. i remember the scene where tom waits is being the prick in the bar and loudly orders a round of drinks for a group of tough looking cowboys by saying "" get a round for the homosexuls down at the end of the bar"" i cant remember if he got his ass kicked or not? gotta watch it.",1341964800,,395,3.7142857142857144
2054978,4,B0002235QC,"I saw ""Cold Feet"" with Marissa Chibas and Griffin Dunne many years ago, and I had a fuzzy VHS copy for a while. This movie broke the mold because instead of following the legally-mandated meet-date-have sex rule of early-relationship movies and rom-coms, Griffin and Marissa spend 90% of the movie guardedly approaching each other, and their dates are about getting to know each other through shared experiences, not about tearing off each other's clothes in a sex-crazed panic and sucking lips like goldfish.  Marissa is intensely cute and nervously charming, Griffin is at his nervous, ironic best, having just wrapped up his marriage to hippie-looney tunes wife Blance Baker (of ""16 Candles"").  One of my favorite films is ""Sleepless in Seattle"", and this fits well in that style.  For a realistic, romantic portrayal of normal people dating, I really liked ""Cold Feet"", and I'm very glad to discover I can order this through Amazon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Feet/dp/B000N2VY1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Feet</a>",1314144000,5,1076,5.7974683544303796
2054979,4,B0002235QC,"I bought this movie for my daughter because she and I are huge fans of Tom Waits, not just because of his music but also because we think he's a funny guy and we weren't disappointed- cause he's funny in this movie. All the actors are great except for Sally Kirkland- bless her heart. Nothing against her acting abilites in general, but she wasn't very well suited for this role at all. All in all, I'm glad I bought it- we both thought it was somewhat amusing and, for us, any chance to see Tom Waits do anything is time well spent and enjoyed by us.",1231200000,5,551,4.2075471698113205
2054980,5,B0002235QC,"I'm always trying to find Tom in a movie..just to check him out.  The gods will be kind one day when Wait's concert documentary Big Time comes out as a legit DVD.  Bizarre that such a visual entertainer has no commercial work on DVD.  Anyway, this film Cold Feet, is a romp that seems to start out a bit ruthless, and then turns into a road film.  Tom plays an idiot/comic crook who really has his head up his butt. If you're a Waits fan, this film will make you smile as you watch Tom's character try to prove himself as a pro, but shoots himself in the foot all the way.  Sally Kirkland shows how flexible her chops are as a sex/food nut, and impresses especially since this is so different than her work in her oscar nominated Anna.  This is a breezy film and a gift for Waits fans.  The role is bigger than what Tom had in Hecto Begencos' classic IronWeed. It's also very cheap used here on Amazon.  The cast is all pro.  Score is hip, and looks like it's also avail here on amazon for super cheap.  Andre",1171065600,17,1009,4.181347150259067
