6554713,5,B00M3O6CSU,"Although it might not be as popular as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" around the Holidays, ""Christmas in Connecticut""(1945) has certainly gained a reputation over the years as the delightful romantic comedy that audiences must have loved when they first saw it. Like the Frank Capra classic mentioned above, ""Christmas in Connecticut"" holds up very well today after nearly seventy years and that is even more apparent now that it is finally on Blu-ray. Those who own the standard DVD will notice the difference in the picture quality right away and Warner's has upgraded the film with a bitrate of 20.96 for it's Blu-ray debut. There are no vertical lines, dirt, torn frames, white specks or any other film damage to be seen with even the smallest details being sharp and clear. Filmed in B & W by cinematographer Carl Guthrie, the set decorations really stand out now on Blu-ray. This is very apparent early in the film during the scene in Mr. Yardley's  wood paneled office where you can almost read the titles of the books in the bookcase.  In another scene, you can easily read the item's on the menu in the restaurant of Stanwyck's Uncle Felix.  Costumes look especially sharp with patterns looking very nice in black and white. Director Peter Godfrey gets great performances out of his cast with romantic leads, Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan having great chemistry in their scenes together. There's not more you can say about Barbara Stanwyck that hasn't already been said before. She was one of the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and her performance in ""Christmas in Connecticut"" is certainly a change of pace from her last film role. This was the first film Stanwyck made after her most famous role in ""Double Indemnity"" and she's delightful in her role as a Good Housekeeping writer who really knows nothing about such things. She gets great support from a stellar line up of character actors including Reginald Gardiner, Sydney Greenstreet, S. Z. Sakall, and Una O'Connor. The Audio(DTS-HD MA 1.0) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, static, etc.). ""Christmas in Connecticut"" is 101 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish. Special features include an Oscar winning short subject and the theatrical trailer.(Note: The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in one of those eco-cutout cases so you may want to switch to a more sturdy case for added protection) ""Christmas in Connecticut"" is a wonderful romantic comedy that only gets better with repeated viewings. Now that it is finally on Blu-ray, it should be an essential addition to any film collection and comes highly recommended.",1415836800,46,2675,5.02027027027027
6554714,5,B00M3O6CSU,"This is a great bluray transfer.  Clear and crisp.  Most importantly, they corrected the frame jumping that occurs in Felix's restaurant on the dvd and digital download from several years ago.",1415664000,30,192,5.161290322580645
6554715,5,B00M3O6CSU,"I have to admit, I don't really like most holiday movies. They tend to be too sugary and whimsical for my taste.

But ""Christmas in Connecticut"" is a delicious exception, being less a holiday movie than a romantic comedy that happens to be at Christmas. Sure, i it's a bit on the fluffy side, but it never dips into the sentimental or syrupy, and the country Christmas makes a delightful setting for a more grown-up Christmas story.

Navy officer Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) nearly starves to death after his ship sinks. While he's recovering, his nurse is convinced that if he spends Christmas at a ""real home,"" he'll go all domestic and marry her. So she writes magazine mogul Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) for assistance. Yardley decides to send Jones to stay with his hottest asset: perfect wife/mother/cook/columnist Elizabeth Lane (Stanwyck), on her farm in Connecticut.

Problem is, she's actually an urban singleton who can't cook to save her life. So to keep up the ruse, Elizabeth hastily accepts a proposal from an old friend, stuffy John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner) -- who happens to have a farm in Connecticut. But when she arrives at the farm, she's instantly smitten with Jones, and starts to rethink the whole marriage thing... especially when her charade starts to collapse.

""Christmas in Connecticut"" is just a funny, romantic, heartwarming little Christmas movie. It straddles the fence between a screwball and a straightforward romantic comedy, and director Peter Godfrey keeps it all looking effortless. It's just fun, fun, fun, even when Elizabeth's secret inevitably comes out.

Instead, Godfrey deftly juggled the romantic and screwball aspects of the movie. A lot of the humor is centered on Sloan trying to marry Elizabeth, and always getting interrupted. There's also some gloriously embarrassing humor from baby-washing, snowdrifts, and pancake flipping.

It also has lots of funny dialogue; when Yardley yells, ""I don't want anything to happen to that baby. It will ruin my circulation!,"" Felix chimes in with, ""It won't do the baby no good, neither."" But it also has some achingly romantic scenes, like Jones and Elizabeth's sleigh ride on a moonlight, snowy night.

Hard-edged but kindly Stanwyck and the boyishly handsome, earnest Morgan have solid chemistry, although it's restricted to G-rated flirting since he thinks she's married. We also get a wonderful performance from Greenstreet, who plays a more genial character than usual. And S.Z. Sakall steals the show as the wily chef Felix, who is determined to see ""Lizka"" live happily ever after with Jones -- the scenes where he feuds with the cook over ""goulash"" are priceless.

For anyone seeking a little Christmas story aimed at grown-ups, this might be the right balance of romance and sly wit. An enchanting little movie for the holidays.",1407024000,30,2832,5.141304347826087
6554716,5,B00M3O6CSU,"This movie is just absolutely wonderful. Actually this is the film that got me discovering Barbara Stanwyck and her films. Instantly in love with her, her look, her voice! Feel good Christmas movie to the max and a must have!",1514592000,,225,4.65

Journalist Miss Elizabeth Lane [Barbara Stanwyck] is one of the country's most famous food writer. In her columns, she describes herself as a hard working farm woman, taking care of her children and being an excellent cook. But this is all lies. In reality she is an unmarried New Yorker who can't even boil an egg. The recipes come from her good friend Felix. The owner of the magazine she works for has decided that a heroic sailor will spend his Christmas on her farm. Miss Elizabeth Lane knows that her career is over if the truth comes out, but what can she do?

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: In the film CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT [1945] Barbara Stanwyck usually burned up the screen in films like Double Indemnity and has been listed number 8 on the American Film Institute's list of greatest screen villains, but with this film would once again prove her amazing versatility in Warner Bros. frothy confection CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT, which would also provide perennial screen-heavy Sydney Greenstreet a chance to show his ""lighter side"" acting skills.

In the film CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT Jefferson Jones [Dennis Morgan] is a naval officer whose destroyer goes down in the Pacific. After eighteen days on a life raft with no food, Jefferson Jones is rescued and brought back to the states to recuperate in a hospital, where he is kept on a steady diet of mush to allow his system to readjust to food. While convalescing, Jefferson Jones dreams of nothing more than a sumptuous meal of the kind described in glowing detail by Elizabeth Lane [Barbara Stanwyck] in her column in the glossy Smart Housekeeping magazine. Along with menus, Elizabeth Lane offers heart-warming, poetic glimpses into her life as a Connecticut farm wife, offering tips on housekeeping and gardening.

In an attempt to win Jones over to idea of marriage, Jefferson Jones is love-struck nurse pens a letter to the publisher of Smart Housekeeping, Alexander Yardley [Sydney Greenstreet], asking to arrange for Jefferson Jones to spend Christmas with Elizabeth Lane and her family on their Connecticut farm, so that Jefferson Jones can get an idea of what happy domestic life would be like. Alexander Yardley seizes on the idea as a patriotic gesture and a great way to boost circulation. What he doesn't know is that Elizabeth Lane's home life is a complete fiction created by the journalist and her editor Dudley Beecham [Robert Shayne], and the mouth-watering menus are provided by their long-time friend, restaurateur Felix Bassenak [S.Z. Sakall]. Although Elizabeth Lane tries to talk him out of it, the overpowering Alexander Yardley not only convinces her that it's her duty to open her home to the wounded serviceman for the holiday, but invites himself along as well.

Certain that Elizabeth Lane will lose her job when Alexander Yardley learns the truth, Elizabeth Lane resigns herself to giving in to the latest marriage proposal from her loquacious suitor John Sloan [Reginald Gardiner], but when Elizabeth Lane and Dudley Beecham remember that Sloan has a Connecticut farm, they hatch a plan to save their jobs by having Elizabeth Lane quickly marry John Sloan and pretend that they've always been together. Unfortunately for John Sloan, the quickie ceremony is interrupted by the early arrival of Jones for his visit, and they must pretend to be married while Lane attempts to play the role of a domestic expert. Elizabeth Lane's simple plan for duping the young officer and her publisher becomes hopelessly complicated when she finds herself falling for Jefferson Jones, but will Elizabeth Lanes dream be fulfilled and we get a really fairy tale ending, well you will have to purchase this brilliant Blu-ray disc to final outcome.

Overall, I really adore this holiday festive film. I love it for it's a hilarious set-up type film. Festive holiday films in general tend to be sappy, mushy, sweet, all rolled up in one package, and although there is certainly nothing wrong with those mentioned adjectives, especially for festive holiday films, it is so nice to get a little change into your festive holiday line-up once in a while, which makes the film CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT totally perfect, for me personally and I know you will feel the same when you view this festive holiday film

This is also a really underrated film, one that perhaps slips under many people's radar, so I strongly encourage you to give it a view around the festive holiday season. It has a bit of a slow start, but eventually you are in for a treat and you are also very well rewarded with the final outcome. The main cast and the supporting actors are totally excellent, the dialogue is very witty and crackles with romantic intrigue, and overall it is a very satisfying, feel good comedy festive holiday film and a lovely combination of screwball meets romance meets holiday festive film. This is a totally refreshing holiday festive film because it really stands out from similar holiday festive films that are so common around this festive holiday time at the end of every year. It might not actually be the most ""Christmassy"" film, but I still strongly suggest you give it a watch. You won't regret it; this isn't one to skip. So the bottom line is purchase this Blu-ray disc and watch it, especially in the Christmas time of the year!

Blu-ray Image Quality  Warner Home Video once again brings you this classic festive film in a glorious 1080p black-and-white image presentation and enhances it with a nice 1.37:1 aspect ratio. The 1080p image resolution has a massive improvement in the predictable areas, like the superior contrast, there is also a very nice film texture and it definitely gives you an easily advances over the inferior DVD release. Contrast is strong, and has excellent grey scale variance that really nicely highlights background elements and gives the picture image a bit of depth. Black levels are rich and inky; and the white of the snow remains bright and very realistic. Close-ups are good, and definitely gives you a significant amount of fine detail, and Barbara Stanwyck's striped jumper is always rock solid and resists giving you any shimmering effects. The source material still exhibits a very solid effort that will certainly please any film fans who love this film and definitely merits an upgrade over the very inferior DVD release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video sadly is only able to supply one audio soundtrack of 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono and gives you great fine sounds throughout the film, with the occasional seasonal composed music score by Friedrich Hollaender that gives the festive film a really nice seasonal feel to its overall performance. At the start of the film you get a wide dynamic scale handles all the highs and lows with ease, and a couple of booming sound moments when the torpedo striking the ship in the opening minutes of the film and even the avalanche of snow cascading off the barn roof later on sounding good and definitely will shake the room without any distortion. Dialogue is always clear and comprehendible, but I have read American reviewers say  when the actor S.Z. Sakall speaks they cannot understand what he is saying, well that is why I am glad I am European, as I could understand everything he says. But one of the more standout moments for me is when actor Dennis Morgan sings with his dulcet crooning voice that really exudes plenty of warmth and charm towards the Christmas spirit. For a 70-year-old film, I feel CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT sounds really good for its age, which of course is really excellent news indeed and well worth upgrading by purchasing this Warner Home Video Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Vintage 1946 Academy Award Winning Short: STAR IN THE NIGHT [1945] [480i] [1.37:1] [21:27] This is a modern version of the Christmas story and adds elements of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" story. On Christmas Eve somewhere in the US southwest, three cowboys are riding through the desert night with items they purchased at a general store. They see a bright light just above the horizon and decide to find out where the light is coming from. The light turns out to be a newly installed light, in the shape of a large star, at the Star Auto Court and auto court's owner, Nick Catapoli [J. Carrol Naish], doesn't believe there is much good left in the world. He complains that people wish each other Merry Christmas, then look out only for themselves the rest of the year and his customers get the brunt of his rudeness, but have no other choice of lodging nearby. A young couple, Jos Santos [Anthony Caruso] and Maria Santos [Lynn Baggett], arrives hoping to get lodging. There are no cabins available, so they must settle for a small shed to sleep in. When the lodgers find out about Maria Santos's medical condition and Nick Catapoli learns that there is still goodness in the world. Cast: J. Carrol Naish, Donald Woods, Rosina Galli, Richard Erdman, Lynn Baggett, Johnny Miles, Anthony Caruso, Irving Bacon (uncredited), Claire Du Brey (uncredited), Dick Elliott Cactus Mack (uncredited), (uncredited) and Virginia Sale (uncredited). Director: Don Siegel. Producer: Gordon Hollingshead. Screenplay: Don Siegel (uncredited), Robert Finch (story) and Saul Elkins (screenplay). Composer: William Lava. Cinematography: L. Robert Burks. Star in the Night won an Academy Award in 1946 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel).

Theatrical Trailer [1945] [1080i] [1.37:1] [1:53] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT. It is really a nice festive trailer that really entices you to enjoy the actual Christmas festive film, because it is a great presentation.

Finally, CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT [1945] is rather like a sweet-potato casserole with melted marshmallows and a real treat that is so curious it defies explanation, and yet so irresistible that no Christmas season would be complete without it. The film's success lies squarely on Barbara Stanwyck's broad shoulders, who is so consummately versatile professional actress, who is well placed at home in ultra-light comedy films as well as hard-bitten drama films that this actress is famous for. Here Barbara Stanwyck shows her infallible ability to tailor her talent to the material. As Elisabeth Lane, Barbara Stanwyck never appears to be working too hard to make the role overly funny, but instead breezes through the film like a breath of fresh air. In the first half of the film, while trying to hide her ignorance of domestic life, Barbara Stanwyck perfectly balances her attempts to appear at ease with the fact that Lane is walking a mine field in which any common domestic task may expose her duplicity. Dennis Morgan proves a charming leading man in a role that is not overly demanding but could have easily been overdone, and Sydney Greenstreet is a total pleasure in one of his rare good-guy roles and it is a particular pleasure to see him re-teamed with co-star S.Z. Sakall in the film Casablanca.

6554719,5,B00M3O6CSU,"I almost didn't watch it because it is in Black & White. I love Christmas movies and am surprised I've never seen it or had it recommended. So I saw it on Amazon Prime Video and was in the mood for something ""new"" that I haven't seen before. What a GREAT movie! The dialogue is smart and hilarious. It's a rare movie where you already feel like your in on the joke when the zingers start to fly. Turn your phone off you won't be bored for a second. This film should be required watching for all potential screenwriters and director's in film school. It could have been written yesterday-except I can't remember when I saw a movie with this thoroughly well written dialogue in the modern era (I'm sure there are I just can't think of any right now). There are so many different scenes that I could comment on (notice how they make fun of antiquated ideas like unwed mother's being bad WITHOUT most of the audience-whom they had to play to it was 1945-having any idea that they are actually making a mockery of it all). Watch the facial expressions of Barbara Stanwyck and Sydney Greenstreet (he play's the magazine editor). Both Oscar worthy performances-but you can't give out Oscar's to a comedy with the world at war in 1945 can you? The film print itself looks glorious. I imagine since it was produced by Mr. Warner himself that Warner Brothers kept it in such pristine condition. I'm grabbing the Blu-Ray for my permanent collection.

6554722,5,B00M3O6CSU,"Christmas in Connecticut (1945) is a warm, upbeat and hilarious film that doesn't have the look or feel of a holiday film at first; in fact, it almost looks like a film noir during the first few minutes. However, things pick up atmospherically, aesthetically, and the darker elements take on a brighter tone for the vast majority of the rest of the film. One strength of the film is its cast, with Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, and Sydney Greenstreet turning in stellar performances with their overall charm. Stanwyck plays her role (as Elizabeth  Lane) to perfection as a woman who must cover her tracks after being put on the spot; that is, she's a cook who can't cook, is married but isn't married, owns a farm but doesn't own a farm,  and has a child but doesn't have a child! Stanwyck exhibits every emotion and facial expression needed to make her deceptive character believable. Things get hairy as her guests begin to suspect her deception, but as it turns out, they have their own deceptions. For Greenstreet, it's quite a contrast from his villainous character in the Maltese Falcon. He plays Mr. Yardley, an assertive boss of a magazine who doesn't listen enough to people. Another strength is the cinematography, especially the interior shots depicting Christmas in the home with a dark and wintry backdrop through the windows, as well as the sleigh sequence that depicts a Christmas wintry setting. This film is unconventional in its approach for a Christmas film, in that it doesn't really 'indulge' in the holiday aesthetic as much as other Christmas films. Despite this, Christmas in Connecticut is a rather jolly film; it had me laughing all the way through. The restoration for the blu ray release is impeccable for a film that's over 70 years old, and the sound is very respectable. The special features portion of the blu ray has the Oscar-winning short, STAR IN THE NIGHT, and a theatrical trailer. Overall, Christmas in Connecticut is essential for your holiday film blu ray collection, and one of the very best Christmas films of all time.",1506384000,2,2065,4.863636363636363

6554739,3,B00M3O6CSU,"This Christmas classic plays itself off as a slightly screwball comedy but it made me squirm.  Many love this classic and they love Barbara Stanwyck's character, Elizabeth Lane, who is getting rich off of a ruse.  That's where this film lost me a bit.  I didn't love her because she was playing everyone for rubes and it was a ""poor me"" act when she got caught.  She also made use of and was willing to wed someone she didn't love but who loved her and was willing to help her out in her charade to get out of her own entangling webbing.  That just made her character less likable to me.  I can see why many people would find this a charmer as the pace is quick and the patter snappy (though not deep), Lane is often in jeopardy and moves from one predicament of her own doing to another before the whole scheme comes apart at the seams like a stuffed turkey sewn too loose, and her fatcat dimbulb boss (played by Sydney Greenstreet who is famous for many a bit part) is easy to root against.  But me?  I just found Stanwyck's central character Elizabeth vacuous and even a little mean.  I didn't laugh.

There is a special feature here that is worthy of mention: a (then) modern retelling of the Christmas story (""Star In the Night"", apparently an Oscar-winning short) that surely warms the heart.  I look forward to watching that again.",1461369600,,1338,4.420408163265306

6554750,4,B00M3O6CSU,"I love this movie, the original 1945 version of Christmas in Connecticut starring Barbara Stanwyck. The more modern 1992 version with Dyan Cannon and Kris Kristofferson cannot hold a candle to the original. In my opinion, the newer version is not worth watching.  Years ago I videotaped a ""Colorized"" version the original from a cable network. Color added so much to this already wonderful holiday movie, but I still wanted a high quality (unfortunately B&W) BluRay version of the movie. I am very happy with my purchase and it joins the ranks of my 300+ Christmas movies in my DVD & BluRay collection. This past holiday season I was also able to obtain a very good ""Colorized"" DVD version of the original from a private vendor.",1426291200,2,728,4.777777777777778

6554762,5,B00M3O6CSU,"The best Christmas movie ever! I watch only once year, but every Christmas Eve -- it's part of my Christmas tradition. This movie takes you back to a time when life, love, and men & women were simpler and more fun (the way life should be!). The ranch house in Connecticut is everyone's dream house and Barbara is every guy's dream wife. I own both the the standard def and this version. The Blu-ray has, of course, better contrast and a sharper image. I would add that this movie is in my top 10 of all time. Please, just buy it (whatever version you can afford, used or new).

PS: The bonus Hollywood short included, a modern day nativity, will make your eyes well the first time you see it... Merry Christmas",1421625600,,710,4.378787878787879

6554765,4,B00M3O6CSU,We added this one to our collection and the reason I gave it a 4 was I did not think the blu-ray was worth the money.  I think the dvd is really just as good.  Just my opinion.,1420588800,,176,3.6052631578947367

6554767,5,B00M3O6CSU,"Christmas In Connecticut is one of our favorite holiday movies.  This Blu-ray makes the black and white ""pop"" when watching it much sharper than the standard dvd.  A funny story, pretty decent acting, and a beautiful setting, will make this a movie that the whole family can watch.  And, you can watch this year after year and never get tired of knowing the outcome.  We put it up there with It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, and Holiday Inn as classic older holiday movies.",1420416000,,480,4.678571428571429

6554769,5,B00M3O6CSU,"One of the best Holiday movies ever made. This really shows off Barbara Stanwyck's comedy talents and has a great supporting cast as well!  SZ Sakall as uncles Felix, at times, steals the show and what a great actor in his own right. He has appeared in so many films, including ""Casablanca"" and several of Doris Day's musicals. What funny is I'm from Hungarian descent and understand some of what he mumbles when insulting another character.....very funny. Robert Shayne in his supporting is great. I got to meet him at his home while going to high school. His daughter Stephanie went to the same school in the San Fernando Valley and our drama group sometimes met at his home after school. He was a very nice and warm person. This film is worth every penny! Buy it and you won't be disappointed.",1419984000,2,796,4.605633802816901
