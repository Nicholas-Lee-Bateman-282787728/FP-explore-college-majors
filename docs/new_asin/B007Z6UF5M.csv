5114954,5,B007Z6UF5M,"I enjoyed the movie very much. It's a story about LDS missionaries who are sent to share their message in the small town of Maryville, a town that typically runs LDS missionaries and others out of town because they don't comply with their definition of Christianity, which is close minded because Mormons (LDS Church) are indeed Christians.

I don't get caught up in the ""could this be possible"" in real life stuff, but watch movies for entertainment and which provoke further thought. This movie did both. I am LDS and grew up in a small town in the south, and in my mother's generation (who grew up in same small town), missionaries like those portrayed in the movie were sent to proselyte in towns without organized branches, as is portrayed in the movie. There were branches in nearby towns about 25 miles away.  There were very few LDS members in my hometown; consequently, members were constantly on trial, not literally, but either directly or indirectly for what they believed.  Members were also watched by non-members to see if they were practicing what they believed and often asked to ""prove it"" from the bible by locals of other denominations. Yes, some were even physically attacked (fist fights) for what they believed, as the movie hinted at happening also (the redneck boyfriends).

The movie portrays an almost unbelievable, though very real, historical era of religious intolerance particularly for the LDS church. I bought the movie and will probably watch it again, because I understood it's message and identified with it. I think it is also a great movie for prospective missionaries to watch, because they experience a lot of rejection when serving missions, often having doors slammed in their faces. It sensitively portrays quiet perseverance and the wisdom and growth that comes to missionaries as they serve. I recommend this movie if you are willing to look for it's deeper message and want to gain additional insights about religious intolerance.",1339372800,9,1976,5.015243902439025
5114955,1,B007Z6UF5M,"The hypocrisy of this film's premise is just ridiculous. One faith groupmade up entirely of innocent, earnest, misunderstood, picked-on and persecuted ""good guys""arguing in court! for societal permission to self-identify as Christian in a film that portrays all other Christian groups, but especially Catholics (the standard whipping boys of Protestant caricature since the Reformation), as wicked, cynical, conspiring, and just plain un-American. (It's unclear which of these attributes is least ""Christian"" according to most LDS.)

All in all a pretty accurate rehearsal of how alive and well (and, indeed, crucial to the sect's identity) the persecution complex is in today's LDS Church. Yes, the same LDS Church that controls a multi-billion-dollar corporation and whose members number among the powerful at all levels of business and government in the U.S. Yes, the same LDS Church whose fine, upstanding members were instrumental in drafting rules under the Chene...er, I mean, Bush Administration that made torture of terrorism suspects legal.

Poor, poor Latter-day Saints. Why won't you just let them call themselves Christians? Why won't you stop pushing back against the systemic misogyny, racism, and homophobia they've been preaching since they set up shop in the shadows of the everlasting hills?",1470873600,,1310,5.611111111111111

5114983,2,B007Z6UF5M,"The premise of this film--two Mormon missionaries having to prove in court that Mormonism is Christian so that they can preach in a town that legislates which religions can proselytize--is so contrary to U.S. practice that to watch it is to require suspending disbelief to a greater extent than one expects in any drama. One call to the ACLU, and it'd be the town that's under trial.

As for the characters, the town's prosecutor (the defense attorney's buddy) turns abrasive toward his friend (who was ORDERED to be the defense attorney), the local Catholic (Episcopalian, maybe?) priest has a demi-Inquisitional flavor, the defense attorney's wife is incredibly non-supportive at the beginning--and after a family tragedy, way TOO supportive, considering the situation--and one of the missionaries referred to a person from the Book of Mormon so many times, it was a wonder that the other missionary didn't bean him over the head with a pile of tracts.

I did enjoy the few bits of comparative theology that were written into the trial, but I do like my theology more in-depth than this mode of presentation allowed. And the unity in intolerance of the old-school Christians struck a sour note--there should have been diversity of expression just because of the differences between the Protestants and Catholics, and that never showed up.

All in all, this film was more of a chore to watch than a pleasure.",1417132800,,1409,5.012820512820513
5114984,3,B007Z6UF5M,"I liked the story. Some of the acting was very good while others were over acted and took away from the message. I recommend this to anyone, just have to be tolerant to get to some of the finer parts of the story. I have to say I often lose patience on this quality of acting but I was glad I sat it out.",1414195200,,304,3.765625
5114985,1,B007Z6UF5M,"This review has a significant spoiler.

I supposed this movie would be very palatable to a Mormon/LDS audience. It explores whether or not the LDS church is Christian in the context of a mock trial in a small American town. It also gives the audience a taste of the missionary experience. The acting is decent and the production value TV-movie quality.

However, the idea that a couple who had just lost a child to a horrific accident could just days after pull themselves together and act like nothing had happened is simply preposterous. I don't care what kind of spiritual experience you have, this is just not believable. As a result, the entire impact of this movie is a joke! How much better to have some other kind of crisis bring to focus the spiritual message? Or at least have the couple have a real, authentic reaction? There is no reason that the trial had to happen as scheduled. Why not write into the story a long period of mourning and contact with the missionaries and wrap up with the end scene, as written?

I'm not religious, but I find the religious experience pretty fascinating. This movie, however, was just not believable.

And what the heck is that picture they show the couple that looks like bubbles or planets and the Earth? That was just weird.",1413936000,,1274,4.623893805309734

5114988,3,B007Z6UF5M,"This movie is definitely an educational tool for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  It was a very hypothetical plot, but the benefit of this movie is that addressed some common theological issues that non-LDS Christians have with LDS Christians. As a recent convert to LDS, I think that non-LDS Christians would actually find this movie quite offensive.",1408320000,,379,5.015873015873016
5114989,1,B007Z6UF5M,"Propaganda- this is a movie that makes up a fantasy as if. It takes the Mormon theme of them against the world.  It sets up the religion as a persecution complex.  This would never ever happen in real life.

The Mormons broke off into many sects and were persecuted in the past.  This movie is about the most prevalent off shoot of the organization the LDS church. It is bogus propaganda.  I would say it might help some teens or children get some misconceptions about the real world.

 However, it does bring home the point that many people are misinformed and do not believe that this religion uses a Christian theology as its centerpiece.  Further there are Jesus time travel and spirit manifestations with the Tribes of Israel being in the South American continent as in the book of Mormon where the whole book is like a fantasy story adapted from the Koran, the Torah, and New Testament.

The LDS church is currently a Christian organization that has added another set of ""Scriptures"" to the religion.  This is propaganda for that religion and it also depicts a Catholic Priest as an enemy.  The courts going after people for preaching door to door in a town is highly unlikely.  Although some towns have anti-solicitation ordinances to protect the public where you are not allowed to go door to door to sell things although some may add religions in I never heard of this.  The whole thing is implausible and cheesy.  Not even a little entertaining unless you are an LDS about to go on a mission and want to be frightened it is of little value. The movie is an exercise in futility and complete nonsense.  I could not watch the end because it is so lame.",1407283200,,1660,4.5608108108108105

5114992,5,B007Z6UF5M,"This is indeed a great story. It brings to light the differences between Christianity and shows the difference in how people want to believe and choose to believe.

5114999,1,B007Z6UF5M,"Other than the above, it was pretty good. Well, except for the fact that the 1st Amendment to the Constitution wasn't even brought up once! This undoubtedly points to the notion that it's more of a figurative movie. It could have been improved by better casting, better direction and a better script. Elder David was completely annoying as the defeatist companion and the ending of the movie I'm sure was intended to show that in our day, the gospel will be largely rejected by the Gentiles. Perhaps it also could have had the town residents stone the elders like Shirley Jackson's short story, ""The Lottery"" described.

After a successful defense, it was disconcerting that the town turned around and ruled against the elders. The evil Baptist minister, Reverend Williams, with his black beard and clothing, was a bit cliche, but what else could be expected? I'm a card carrying Mormon, but our cause is often hurt by well meaning bad film making. Only recently have great videos like the JOURNEY OF FAITH series and TRUMAN MADSEN's ON SACRED GROUND series have broken through the mold and shown that great LDS films can be made.

5115005,1,B007Z6UF5M,"What a hilarious set up.  The movie is set in present day....and they act as if it would be constitutional to force preachers to prove that they are Christian before being allowed to preach.  Thankfully, that is absurd in our present day. The very notion of a town that is able to keep out all non-Christian forms of worship is just not even possible in any time in recent history. No Synagogues, no Mosques, no Hindus, no Sikhs, no Buddhists, and I take it no dancing... this town must be secluded indeed. It is true and unfortunate that street preachers and missionaries frequently get hassled by the cops, that is wickedly real.  But this movie makes it so crazy over the top that it seems like this town is on another planet, or at least in another country.  A quick look at reviews on imdb reveals that many LDS members are embarrassed by this movie.  There is prejudice certainly, but the way this movie portrays it being legally entrenched is -in present day USA- suspends more disbelief than a Sci-Fi flick.

Then we move to the arc of the story where the young missionaries have to prove that they are really ""Christian"" as Mormon believers.  The whole town, families and friendships are shaken to the core by the simple presence of these two adolescents. The prosecution tries to make an archaic argument about the trinity....as if being a Christian depended more upon someone's grasp of finer theological points than on the core principles of love and how people treat each other.  And of course, many Christians throughout the world and throughout time have argued about just which books should be included in the Bible.  Now the entire trial occurs with just the public defender and the two young missionaries. Nobody from LDS shows up to help out. That's a little tough to swallow as well. I could take all of this if an intelligent discussion were held about religion or Christ's message, but aside from a tit for tat about Biblical inconsistencies, that never quite materializes. That is the real shame and disappointment of this film. An opportunity to talk about the commonalities of all Christians, and in fact all religions, was utterly wasted.

Music is sickly sappy sweet much of the time. The contemporary gospel tunes play much better than the strings and piano underscoring.  And far too many musical montage scenes that fail to resonate with any meaning. They should have cut out 20 minutes of this vapidity.

Acting is mediocre. Production values adequate, except that the whole thing would play more believably as a period piece.  And overall, not quite a bad enough movie to be entertaining for it's own sake.",1366761600,5,2638,4.784140969162996
5115006,1,B007Z6UF5M,"A third rate attempt to proselytize.  Predictable hum drum plot (misunderstood missionaries take on a religiously bigoted town of nitwits).
