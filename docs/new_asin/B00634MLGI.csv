8491823,5,B00634MLGI,Jordan Christopher was such an under-appreciated actor. His acting alone makes this film so worth seeing!!! I had the great pleasure and privilege to have seen him on Broadway in SLEUTH opposite Patrick Macnee. Brilliant!!! The movie is a wonderful time-piece worthy of cult status at the very least.,1480723200,,300,5.142857142857143

This movie actually has the reissue title Pigeons on the title card and is a full 15 minutes shorter than the original release. There are no extras added. But it is a rarelt seen film until now under any name and length. My rating is for the reduced length for which there is no explanation. I have not seen the film at this point in time.",1329436800,2,562,6.025
