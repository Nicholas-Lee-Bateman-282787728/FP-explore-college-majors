7950810,3,B00005QT1C,"I saw this film in Barcelona when it came out.  Carmen Maura is spectacular and eclipses everything else in the film.  Her best performance by far, and from the days when she was no longer working with Almodovar.  From what I recall from the French audio and Spanish subtitles, Maura plays a former rebel in Algeria (before independence from France).  After independence and now in the present day, the country is still shell shocked by its colonial past.  Unemployment is rampant.  Tensions between the sexes appear high.  Maura plays a landlord of a building with interesting residents, and spends much of her time arguing with them and getting them to pay rent.  There is a beautiful wedding toward the end.  There is a sort of catharsis at the end as Maura's character learns something about herself.  I may be misremembering but I think there is also a bloody shoot out at the end.",1297814400,,886,4.73202614379085
