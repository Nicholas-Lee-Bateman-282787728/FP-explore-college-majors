207141,1,5559203726,"I don't understand why moviemakers pick out a book with a fantastic story and loyal following to make a movie from and then completely invent their own story. I am a huge Janette Oke fan. I own all her books and have read the Love Comes Softly series until I've about memorized the books. I was so excited that they were being made into movies. Love Comes Softly movie wasn't too bad. Love's Enduring Promise, however, was a huge disappointment. It was nothing like the book at all. The books are supposed to be about Clark and Marty and Marty had hardly any role in this one at all. The acting seemed weak except where Clark needed his leg cleaned and bandaged after a logging accident and then everyone over-acted. I wondered if they were going to amputate his leg (a scene from a later book, following an extremely serious cave-in). The sets were not at all real looking. I hope the little plot of land being plowed was just one of many fields, because that was not big enough to sustain a family of five. The plot seemed to jump around and not make sense. Missy teaches school, but there's only one small school scene. She has two younger brothers -- Aaron (Marty's son from her first marriage) and Arnie (Clark and Marty's together), yet they were hard to tell apart and had very little purpose in the movie. While Clark is healing, a young man is hired to take over his chores. Once Clark figures out who the young man is, the whole movie is diverted to talk about his story. There weren't really any peripheral characters in the movie -- they didn't run into people in town, go to church, have visitors over for tea. It was like they were the only people in town. When Missie and Willie headed west, I hope they weren't going far. That wagon was tiny (the prairie schooners used by pioneers were pretty large) and hardly had anything in the back of it. I don't think they were prepared to spend up to a year living out of it. Missie's explanation of the phrase ""love's enduring promise"" was way out in left field. The book's title refers to Marty saying that Missie and Willie's ""love had promise, enduring promise.""",1109376000,10,2123,4.474226804123711
207142,5,5559203726,"Excellent movie, but watch Love Comes Softly first.  Really enjoyed watching January Jones; finially, someone let her speak.  She's been in a few movies but very small parts.  Hey, Hollywood, we'd like to see more of this young actress.

This is a good, clean family movie.  Highly recommend.",1108598400,4,292,5.0
207143,4,5559203726,"I watched this movie on the Hallmark channel the other day and i loved it! It was good as and even better then the first movie - Love Comes Softly. Its about Missy, the young girl from the first movie who is now grown up and is the community school teacher. In this movie about love and forgiveness, Missy's father has a bad accident during the planting season. Because of this, Missy must stop her teaching for the season and help with the farming and plowing so her family will not go hungry. Then Will, a  young man from the past comes back to ask his father forgiveness for something done along time ago. While gathering enough courage to go and talk to his father he finds missy and her family in need of help. When it comes time for him to leave, Missy must face her feelings and decide between Willy and a young, rich surveyor who has already asked her to marry him. This is another good, clean movie for the whole family to watch. This sweet story will make you laugh and cry!",1108425600,8,984,4.290322580645161

207145,3,5559203726,"Love Comes Softly by Hallmark was wonderful! It was so good that I wrote Hallmark begging them to air the show once again! I did buy all four books in the series (there are eight altogether). This movies attemtps to squeeze all three books into one moving and the result is a confusing mess. If you haven't read the books, you will enjoy the movie. I would suggest the books and of course, the DVD of Love Comes Softly. It is a shame because they intended to make a good movie, but it falls flat.",1105401600,2,496,4.231578947368421
207146,5,5559203726,"I saw this film recently on the Hallmark Channel, and TIVO'd it to watch again and again (at least, until it hits DVD, and I buy it from Amazon): I am definitely going to buy the DVD when it comes out!  Based on a novel by best-selling Christian fiction write Janette Oke, ""Love's Enduring Promise,"" is a heart-warming continuation of the story of Marty and Clark Davis...

By now, Clark's daughter Missy is all grown up and teaching at the local schoolhouse: she meets two very different men through circumstance, a young surveyor named Grant Thomas and a mysterious stranger named Nate; when a family accident forces her to accept the help of this mysterious stranger...

For those of you worried about content, this is a clean film!  There is no language that I can recall; there is an arguement between father and son, some blood when a man accidentally hurts himself, and little else.

This is a wonderful, family-friendly story that promotes good values of love, honor, courage, faith, forgiveness, and much more!  Highly recommended as a break from the typical Hollywood fare...",1101859200,123,1085,4.869565217391305

207164,5,5559203726,"In this sequel to the ""Love Comes Softly"" movie, we have Missie, the former tomboy who is now a grown up young lady, facing decisions as to which beau to court.  She is a school teacher now and has to close the school after her father has an accident during the planting season.  We have the educated and well to do railroad surveyor who is interested in Missie and then the return of a mysterious Willie/Nate who also has eyes on Missie.  While the Nate fellow is portrayed very nicely by a very handsome lad in Logan Bartholomew, I actually felt more of a kinship with the railroad fellow because he seemed more educated.  But, alas, romantic literature often takes its liberties.  It did seem like the grown up Missie had almost nothing in common, personality wise, with the young Missie that we saw in the last film.  As this Missie is more of a weakling than the young Missie.  However, the movie is still a very lovely one.  With Missie's father very well portrayed by Dale Midkiff.  And Katherine Heigl as the mature stepmother.  The ending of this movie is a bittersweet one.  As while the wedding is lovely, the farewell scene brings tears to ones eyes.  January Jones does her role well.  And once again, the background features beautiful and lovely scenery.  It is very family friendly and a nice movie to watch.",1456358400,,1323,4.574468085106383

207185,5,5559203726,"This set contains the second and third movies in the ""Love Comes Softly"" collection. They are excellent movies, but you have a much better alternative. They give you a view of what life was like in the second half of the 19th century. You'll see comings and goings, people doing the right thing, and others trying to get away with whatever they can get away with. It is a wonderful collection, and I will be watching all ten movies again and again.

I highly recommend that you purchase the 10-movie set:

. . . . . . . . . LOVE COMES SOFTLY: TENTH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION

I can't mention the price here, but when I purchased it, it was less than double what you'd pay for this particular 2-movie set, and for that bargain price, you get eight more movies, 10 DVDs in all.

207248,5,5559203726,"The movie is very loosely based on a book by Janette Oak.  It would be unfair here to even try to compare them because there are very few similarities between this and the book!

In this story, Clark and Missy have added a son to their family, though he is seen very little in this story.  Clark injures his leg when Marty's son produced from her first husband cries out.  Clark cuts his leg and is severely injured.  This is a scene loosely based on something that happened in the fourth book (I believe) and Clark actually lost his leg.  But in this story, Marty and Missy take over the plowing while Clark is laid up and developing gaingreen.  Along comes a stranger who takes over the plowing and then helps Clark when there is no doctor around.  As the show progresses, the stranger and Missy fall in love and we learn his true identity.

I really, really like the man who played Clark.  He made a good Clark.  We'll see him and his godly wisdom in future movies.  Missy is a bit different from what I expected though.  But like I said, I just cannot compare this movie to the books!  It'w well worth watching as a wholesome family movie.",1388188800,,1143,4.355450236966824

207255,4,5559203726,"Back when I lost my man card and started routinely tuning in to Hallmark Channel programming,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Comes-Softly/dp/B0002IKSFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Comes Softly</a>&nbsp;surprised me with its ability to keep me planted on the couch, eyeballs peeled to the screen. LOVE'S ENDURING PROMISE sequels up LOVE COMES SOFTLY, with Katherine Heigl and Dale Midkiff reprising their roles. Only, this follow-up doesn't gravitate around them. Instead, their characters - Clark and Marty Davis - take a back seat to their daughter, Missie Davis, who this time is played by January Jones.

It's about ten years since the events in LOVE COMES SOFTLY. Missie is now an 18-year-old schoolteacher (if my math hasn't failed me). She now has two younger brothers, both of whom are in her class. Missie is now around that age when she's ready for big things to happen in her life. Appropriately, the story's central conflict revolves around Missy's being courted by two suitors, one a polished scion of a railroad empire (Mackenzie Astin), the other a mysterious young drifter (Logan Bartholomew) who helps out with the farm when Clark Davis suffers a grave injury while chopping wood. A sub-plot surfaces concerning the Davis family's attempts to help the drifter reconcile with his troubled past.

To quote my neighborhood's pastor, who's got a wicked sense of humor: ""I'm not a very religious man."" Gratifyingly, Clark Davis, in his conversations with the young man Willie, doesn't come across as pushy preachy. His words seem a comfort to me. On Willie, those words must settle on him like cool balm to an anguished soul. He pays heed to Clark's talk of God's enduring promise, that ""one day, He will wipe away every tear and there will be no more pain, hardship, or suffering."". Midkiff continues to portray Clark Davis as a man of integrity and deep compassion and unflinching faith. Honestly, this may be his best role.

Whenever I watch these Janette Oke screen adaptations, I hearken back to Laura Ingalls' Little House on the Prairie books which I ate up when I was a kid. Oke's long-running series, as translated to your living room screen, are these prairie romances that promote strong family values and deliver a timeless message. I love the historical angle, love that these stories take place in early American West and that we're made privy to how harsh everyday life was for the pioneers.

The actors keep it low-key and believable. Their restraint grounds the narrative, and there's a sense that real life is unfolding right there before our eyes. January Jones keeps your eyes firmly focused on her, although I do admit that Skye McCole Bartusiak, who was around 11-years-old when she played Missie so brilliantly in LOVE COMES SOFTLY, trumps her performance-wise. LOVE'S ENDURING PROMISE, like the other movies in this series, goes for the aesthetics of the quiet, heartfelt drama. In a world rife with rampant cynicism and messed-up reality shows and other televised grotesqueries, I find the film's gentle simplicity - its lack of artifice - refreshing and so very appealing. Ain't that so, Honey Boo Boo?

207256,5,5559203726,"Possibly one of my favorite movies. I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Love's Enduring Promises was really quite clean.  The only violence is when Clark is startled as he is chopping wood and cuts himself in the leg. Blood is shown (nothing too graphic I guess) during a few more scenes as they are trying to treat the wound to get rid of the infection.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  The Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for all ages.

I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry.  So I only watch certain ones.  Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream.  They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.

Missie Davis is busy being a school teacher and doing her fair share on the farm, especially after her father's accident.  A mysterious stranger, Nate, shows up who not only helped save her father but also helps out on the farm since her father can't work. She is very nearly swept off her feet when a handsome railroad heir starts to ""court"" her.  Nate doesn't talk much about his past, but Clark soon guesses who he really is (Willie who ran away when he was young and is the son of Clark's friend) Clark tries to help him move on, but Willie's father won't forgive him and he is hurt seeing  Missie with another man, since he has always love her.  Willie is about to leave and Missie must decide which kind of life she wants and what is truly important in life.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1372636800,,2041,4.439678284182306

207288,3,5559203726,"Although this movie doesn't go by the book AT ALL, it's still good. It's my favorite in the series.
It's basically about how Missie, the schoolteacher, is swept off her feet by a wealthy son of the owner of a railroad. But gradually, she finds herself doubting her feelings for him, and realizes that she really loves Willie Lahaye (yay), a young man with a troubled past.
Willie's story in the movie: years before, he is blamed for the death of his little brother after Willie can't find their way home on a cold winter night. His whole family breaks apart, and his father becomes very bitter. Willie runs away and for years goes by the name Nate. Then he shows up at the Davises, helps to save Clark's leg after it is infected (he has had a serious accident with an axe), and does all of Clark's work till he gets better. Why does he do all this? Because he loves Missie, of course. Just fyi, NONE of this is in the book. Willie then goes back to his father, hoping to patch things up, but his father is still too bitter. (By the way, his dad's house looks SO unrealistic. The wood walls and floor are PERFECTLY clean, and there is almost nothing in the house except a table, some chairs, and a stove.) Clark helps Willie to heal his past, and in the process makes himself look very fake.
The acting is good and the story is good. Very good message: don't marry the person to whom your FEELINGS belong, marry the person to whom your HEART belongs. Willie proved his love for Missie, and the other dude turned out to be a jerk. The romance is very sweet and touching, and you might even cry at the end. Missie looks absolutely GORGEOUS in her wedding dress and pink bonnet, but Willie...can't he even brush his hair for his own wedding? ;-)",1347753600,,1741,4.36

At first I thought it was a bad acting, but as movie progressed, I realized, that it was so heavily soaked with religious dogma, that it was unnatural - it has nothing in common with a first movie or real life. How can lively creative Missy become such a boring boneless person? Seems to me as a total miss. People behave and talk like marionettes.

207296,4,5559203726,"Whenever you see the words ""based on"" you know the film isn't going to follow the original story...as proves the case in this series.  I don't usually like films that are ""based on"" - particularly if I have loved the original stories - but I did enjoy this series directed by Michael Landon Jr. If you can accept these aren't the stories of the books written by Christian author Janette Oke, they are an enjoyable set of films of love & faith to watch in their own right.

In this film:
Missie Davis has grown up, & is now teacher at the school. She has attracted the interest of wealthy Grant Thomas -a surveyor with the railroad - who sets out to woo her.
Clark Davis has a serious accident, which means he now can't plough or plant. As Marty takes care of Clark, Missie closes the school & takes over the ploughing - struggling rather! Stranger Nate (or is he? Clark & Missie are sure he's familiar) who helped bring Clark back to the farm after his accident appears again & takes over the ploughing & planting - much to Missie's relief. He also saves Clark's leg through vital surgery.
Which man will Missie choose - the one who can offer her everything so there won't be any difficulties to worry about, or the one who will love her through the difficulties that arise?

the sunlit outdoor scenes of the country side, farm, small town, and  and country life back in the pioneer days will remind you of your grandparents' childhoods. the sensitively cast and well-acted characters will remind you of teachers, friends, relatives, and other people of noteworthy guidance and inspiration in your life

the two littlest boys are total charmers and i couldn't stop thinking about my nephew listening to one of them speak. katherine heigl is wonderful in her pre-grey's anatomy sky rocket to fame and in her few though powerful scenes  you can see the talent and ability that will catapult her to fame. dale midkiff as her unexpected second husband is moving and magnificent as a devout man of pure heart and love for his family and way of life. the young actor portraying willie/nate is outstanding as is the other who portrays his rival for january jones's characters affection, whom i personally thought did a wonderful job

Hello.....Nathan was Willie's OLDER brother, and he did NOT have a little brother named Mattie who froze to death - his OLDER SISTER died in childbirth after marrying the schoolteacher (BEFORE Missie was old enough to teach school in the first place)!  In the book, Grant Thomas was only ""present"" in the story when he asked Missie's mother if he could take her for a drive, and was never heard from again except when Missie asked her mother how she could tell him she only wanted to be friends.

The movie started out well enough.  Wonderful filming, great costuming, glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time.  No, the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie.

The scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch.  I remembered the tomboyish Missie from the last film and couldn't wait to see her older.  The actress portraying the older Missie just did not do her justice! While she was pretty, she read most of her lines flat, with little emotion.  The worst was the very ending, which was supposed to have been a heart-breaking moment between father and daughter, instead fell completely flat.  In fact, most of the scenes with Missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left.

I think there were several attempts to portray Missie as spirited (like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant), but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid Missie we were continually seeing.

Apart from that, the rest of the cast was average, with a few star moments here and there.  I can't remember the book very well to check for accuracy, but the story was so-so as well -- melodrama only reared its head in a few places.

Only if you want to keep up-to-date with the series, I would recommend this.  Otherwise, I'm glad they replaced Missie's actress for the next film.  Perhaps we'll get to see a more energetic performance.",1154649600,8,1683,4.566666666666666

I understood why Landon chose to cast an older Missy, and was okay with other changes they made to the book.  I was so excited to see the sequel.  What a bummer!!  I thought the sequel was HORRIBLE!!  Did it even come from the same book?  Where were Marty and Clarke?  They were very present in the book.  We weren't even introduced to the rest of the family!

I just wish that there were more movies this clean out there that actually told a good story as well. They are becoming fewer and fewer every day. I do agree that Landon shouldn't have removed the word Jesus entirely from the story but that is the world we live in. People work too hard to keep from offending anyone else. However, someone brought up the point that good Christian women never wore pants in that era and I would like to correct you. MOST women did not, but you certainly could find women wearing pants on the Prairie. At times, that was the only way they could do their work. They would only hold to convention when going into town or to Sunday service. Someone also mentioned that although they hadn't actually read the book, they still expected this movie to revolve around Marty & Clark. You really should read the books, or at least what they are about before forming expectations. Although her books keep the same characters throughout the series, everyone has their own story and their roles change in each book.",1133222400,6,1294,4.418410041841004
207391,3,5559203726,"Am not sure if this is how Janet Oke wrote the story or not, because i haven't read the book...but i was expecting it to be moslty about the two main characters (Marty & Clark), from the first film. It is not.

It was somewhat dissapointing. Not that i didn't enjoy it, and not that it wasn't a good story, it was, but overall, it could have been much better. For one, it's obvious the director, Michael Landon, jr., showed us he is a good Catholic and never wants to offend any other religions...keeping the name of Jesus Christ (or even just, 'Jesus'), out of the entire dialogue. To say that a devoutly Christian man, living circa 1880, never used the name of his Lord and Savior, even during prayers, is ludicrous. Not only would they have ended every prayer in the name of Jesus, His name was a common part of every day language of the period. I've noticed that most films produced by Jews rarely use the name of our Lord, unless in the abstract, or unless said by a church authority figure, such as a priest of professor. As if the common believer was not educated enough to properly express His name. That flaw was inexcusable.

There are other flaws too, although not as appalling...none-the-less they take away from the power of the story (as i do feel the author, Janet Oke, intended it to be inspiring!?), and degrade it to 'B'-class status.

Too bad. The acting, costumes, locations, sound quality, etc. were all superb...what a waste.

One flaw i noticed might have been intentional, when Missie (now a young woman), was riding her horse, she was not riding side-saddle...and she was wearing a dress. I know she grew up kind of a tom-boy, but a Christian lady of that time period, wearing a dress, i seriously doubt would've rode like a man, tom-boy or no. Since i haven't read the book, then i can't say if that was intended or not. Not to be too critical, but that seemed to be an inaccurate portrayal of a Christian lady, circa 1880.

 The other flaw was not as obvious. If you noticed, when Missie had to plow the fields, they first showed her wearing a dress. Then they show a scene of her wearing trousers. The final scene she is again wearing a dress. Now i don't know about you but as far as i know, Christian ladies back then did not wear men's trousers, period. The only pants they wore were their bloomers, and that was under their petticoat. Women were extremely modest in those days...especially when outdoors. We're not talkin about Annie Oakly here...we're talking about the daughter of a very devout Christian man. Again, i don't know if this was part of the original story, but i do know it was not historically accurate. Either that or the director just couldn't make up his mind, or the editors just botched the scenes.

 Other than that, the only other thing i didn't like, was the fact that the story centered around other than the two original characters. My question is, why? We barely got to experince life with Marty and Clark, and now they have two young boys, and Missie is all grown up. Excuse me, but this is not how you make a series of films on this type of story. We need to get to know the characters better. Yes, i cried in both films, but hey, I'm a big cry-baby anyways . But they could have done a much better job. Overall though, it is a good family film, and certainly better than all the immoral sex, violence and drug crap put out by Hollywood every day. So i do commend them on that. But if you watch the film, Time Changer, then you'll know why i had a major complaint about this poor effort.

207410,4,5559203726,"Though ""Love's Enduring Promise"" doesn't measure up to its predecessor, ""Love Comes Softy,"" it is nevertheless lovely to follow up on Clark Davis and his family, who share their joys and sorrows, and their faith, strength, and commitment with one another. Missie is now a young lady, with serious choices to make. She is a schoolteacher, and is being pursued by a wealthy surveyor, but when Clark suffers an accident and can no longer work the farm, a young man comes to their aid, and the viewer knows long before Missie does, that he is a better match for her.

The dialog and scene progression don't flow as well in this 2nd film, but I wouldn't mind seeing a 3rd and even 4th installment, as it is refreshing to see this type of family entertainment, where people speak without cursing, and keep their clothes on. It would make an excellent TV series, as it is full of wonderful characters, and themes of hope and redemption. Directed by Michael Landon Jr. for Hallmark, it is a little like his father's wildly successful ""Little House on the Prairie."" Based on a novel by Janette Oke, the 19th century plot is filmed in beautiful California locations, like Sable Ranch in Canyon County, with cinematography by Maximo Munzi.

The cast: January Jones is good as Missie, with Mackenzie Astin as Grant, her rich suitor, and Logan Bartholomew, who is an exceptionally handsome and capable actor. as Nate. Katherine Haigl repeats her role as Marty, and as Clark, Dale Midkiff once again is superb. Cliff De Young plays Zeke, an embittered man with many scars that need healing.

207415,5,5559203726,"""Loves Enduring Promise"" is an excellent movie in every aspect.  I have never read a Janette Oke book in my life.  This movie made me want to go out and read everything she has written.  With so many Christian fiction films falling short on talent and creativity, not to mention financial backing, it was great to watch a Christian-based film firing on all cylinders.

From the opening scene, where Marty and Clark are laying in a meadow talking about how blessed they are, to the last scene, this is a movie that ya just have to love.  It reminded me of the best episodes of  ""Little House on the Prairie"" (yes, there were some episodes of that great show that delivered cheesy plots).

January Jones is fantastic as Missy Davis.  She has so many great scenes in the film, from being locked out of the schoolhouse by the children to telling the handsome railroad heir what she thinks about a man that wouldn't help her tend the fields if that help was ever needed.  Her character is so interesting and fun to watch interact with those around her.

207419,1,5559203726,"I haven't even seen this movie and I won't because I have read all the books and what the heck happened to Willie LaHaye? Why do they feel the need to rewrite the story?

Missie falls in love with Willie LaHaye and goes West with him. Willie is her neighbor and the school bully. Janet Oke's stories are SO GOOD, there is no need to alter them in any way. What is WITH this love triangle they've got Missie in??? Never happened. She saw Lou Graham for a while and some of the other neighbor boys but is in love with WILLIE.

Furthermore, I was dissapointed in Love Comes Softly (which I did see.) Although a lot closer to the original, they changed Missie's age (in the book she was only about a year old when Marty came to live with them) and they changed Marty's husband's name (Clem) for unknown reasons. They also made Marty more educated than she was and without an accent (as if she were from the East or something) And I hate to break it to the director, but no one but bar girls had bobs in the pioneer days. Also, during the snowstorm, Marty was the one shooting the gun for Clark to hear so he could get back (although I don't think she needed to use it) He had taken the dog with him so he found his way back. The only scenes that happened the way it did in the book was the funeral and Clark's proposal, and the fried chicken incident. It's too bad. There were so many other great events in the book.

So, just reading the story line of Love's Enduring Promise makes me so angry! Why do they do this to good literature? WHY? When a book has a following, if you mess with the story, we get MAD.

I won't be watching Love's Enduring Promise and I recommend you skip it too and get the book instead.",1119830400,9,1708,4.166666666666667

207422,4,5559203726,"Love's Enduring Promise certainly promises to be a heartfelt and wonderful period family drama. It's a story about trauma, redemption, hardship, love-triangle, and family values in the 1800's of Midwest of America. Often times, period pieces can be slow-paced, but this film is thoroughly captivating and the characters are well written.

Missie Davis(January Jones) is a well educated country young woman, who works as a teacher and on the farm as well. One day, his father Clark Davis(Dale Midkiff) had a serious accident, and was left bed-ridden for weeks. She has two younger brothers, and her stepmother is from the east of America. While struggling to work the land for pre-plantation, along came two men whom would changed her life. One is a wealthy world-travelling business man named Grant Thomas(Mackenzie Astin), who instantly fell for Missie's beauty, and he thinks he can convince her to become his future wife. The second man is a drifter named Nate/Willie(Logan Bartholomew), who had ran away from from a broken home six years earlier, and he's returning in hoping to reconcile with his father who blamed him for the death of his younger brother. He happened to rescued Clark and took hime back to Missie's house. Later, he even treated Clark's infected leg, and volunteerily worked the land for the season.

Missie eventually would have to face the decision of a lifetime when Grant increasingly pressured her to become his wife, while Nate is secretly in love with her. Her father had established a strong connection with Nate and helped him deal with his traumatic past. Nate's reunion with his estranged father turned out to be an ugly experience. Missie must decide what to do about her love life.

The leads all turned in very good performances, and I think Logan Bartholomew was more captivating, because his character was multilayered, and his scenes were more touching. Do prepare to endure a few tearjerking moments.",1116201600,4,1941,5.059375
