2699727,3,B000L21286,"These are well-acted stories about everyday people who find themselves involved in a mystery.  The settings are commonplace, but varied and interesting.  The plots are not predictable, but not always satisfying.  They vary in quality, and generally lack the pizzaz of Agatha Christie stories.  The cast lacks glamor.",1199318400,3,316,5.520833333333333
2699728,1,B000L21286,"I can't believe how they messed up Ruth Rendell's mystery, THE SECRET HOUSE OF DEATH. I bought the dvd set just to see this book brought to the screen, as it's my favorite of her many mysteries.  I have read it over many times.  What a disappointment!  The video version left out one of the main male characters, who basically solves the mystery.  He is captivated by the main female character, which gives added depth and meaning to the mystery. Ruth Rendell should be screaming BLOODY MURDER, and I was a fool for buying it.",1198972800,8,526,4.505263157894737
2699729,4,B000L21286,"As a lifelong fan of Ruth Rendell's books, I agree with some of the other reviewers here--these 4 TV adaptations are a mixed bag. The best by far is MASTER OF THE MOOR, with (chubby!) Colin Firth's chilling portrayal of the weird central character, and a lot of good location filming on actual Yorkshire moors. 2 of the others, VANITY DIES HARD and THE SECRET HOUSE OF DEATH, are okay, though nowhere nearly as good as the books on which they're based. And the last, THE DOUBLE, is a very odd, rather pointless entry based on one of Rendell's less effective short stories, made even odder by weak casting in the crucial double role at the center of the story. The girl is pretty, but not much of an actress. Still, these are a good intro to the wonderful world of Ruth Rendell, and the best they can do is make you read her books. You won't regret it.",1177286400,18,851,4.3584905660377355
2699730,5,B000L21286,"These stories are full of suspense, mystery, and love.  Great Escapism.",1173571200,3,71,5.454545454545454
2699731,3,B000L21286,"I saw three of these productions on TV about ten years ago, and as adaptations of Rendell's novels they're disappointing.  I expect any film version to take some liberties with the plot of a book, but in the ones I saw (I haven't seen ""The Double"") they changed characters and plot points for no apparent reason.

The films are OK considered on their own merits, but are generally below the level of most British TV imports, with a cheesiness you don't see in BBC productions.

Still, this set offers four films at a reasonable price, and if you don't know the books, you may find them enjoyable.  If you're a Rendell fan, however, you'll want to wait for the three Barbara Vine adaptations (A Dark Adapted Eye, Gallowglass, A Fatal Inversion) which are so far the best adapatations of Rendell's work I've seen.  There's a set on Region 2 DVD; hopefully it will be available on Region 1 at some point.

There are a couple of good Wexford adapatations on DVD (Simisola and Road Rage), with George Baker as the stalwart Inspector.  Also, the French film Alias Betty is ""The Tree of Hands"", moved to France.  Claude Chabrol's ""The Bridesmaid"" is another excellent French adaptation of a Rendell novel.",1171929600,59,1198,4.698564593301436

2699739,5,B000L21286,Oh my is Colin Firth heartbreaking and decidedly not dashing or heroic in this part. This is pre Darcy so he is playing a regular guy and not a sex god. He is in the Master of the Moor. Excellent. His acting is so much better than the other - that is the only flaw here. Great story. I didn't guess the ending. I highly recommend it.,1405123200,,333,3.985074626865672
2699740,4,B000L21286,"I just watched ""Master of the Moor"" (1993), starring Colin Firth as Stephen Whalby. We all know that Colin was exceptional; however it took a good compliment of actors to play off of.

Yep Stephen finds a body on the moor. And we all know that the finder is more than likely the culprit, at least in Det. Insp. Manciple's (George Costigan) mind. I believe the inspector right off. The only problem with that is it seems too simple.

Soon as predicted by Stephen more moorish dispatches occur. Seems that everyone has a secret.

Watch and you will not be disappointed. Not quit the stature of the  ""Midsummer Murder"" series. The pacing however seems a tad slow. However that is what makes the series different.",1400284800,,709,4.648
2699741,5,B000L21286,"I've been a fan of Ruth Rendell's for years, and I was happy to find these available.  I missed them on PBS.  I thoroughly enjoyed each of the mysteries - watched the three right-through, on one rainy day.  I recall that, years ago, PBS once did A Dark Adapted Eye, (by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine) and it was better than the book.  These are quite good also!",1378857600,3,368,4.2898550724637685
2699742,5,B000L21286,"I purchased this for the Master of the Moor, starring Colin Firth as Stephen Whalby. It is excellent, and, I think one of Firth's better performances. Very creepy, with a surprise ending.  The other mysteries included are also good but Master of the Moor is the best. I later read the book, but the film is far superior to the novel.

2699743,5,B000L21286,These shows are truly wonderful - not at all showing signs of age.  The acting is excellent but the stories themselves are so intricate that you can watch them repeatedly.,1357344000,4,171,4.7

2699745,5,B000L21286,"As a Firth fan, loved Master of the Moor. So many characters, all of them suspects. The detective was especially creepy. A great who done it.",1307577600,3,141,4.461538461538462
2699746,4,B000L21286,"Set 1 of Ruth Rendell Mysteries is headlined by ""Master of the Moor,"" with Colin Firth as Stephen Whalby, the rather strange, rather earnest young man who writes the local newspaper column about the moor. Since his childhood, when his mother deserted him and his father--and destroyed his father's sanity in the process--Stephen has invested his emotions in the moor, finding in it the antidote to his loneliness and feelings of betrayal.

Now, however, the bodies of young women are turning up dead on his beloved moor, and worse still, Stephen is the one finding them; the one being hounded by the police inspector. His wife grows more anxious as it becomes obvious that Stephen is the prime suspect, and his father grows more unbalanced. Meanwhile, his marriage--always strange--plunges into turmoil.

This is a terrific story, with tension building almost unbearably--the pity and terror that Aristotle prescribed for the theatre become overwhelming. Colin Firth is extraordinarily effective in terrorizing and touching us. He doesn't seem to have killed those women--or did he? And what about the third and final murder on the moor?",1302912000,3,1137,5.2076502732240435
2699747,1,B000L21286,"Perhaps a younger generation (I'm past 65) would find the stories interesting, but I did not; they seemed contrived and pointless. The acting was, of course, superlative. The Ruth Rendell Mysteries will prove very disappointing to anyone who appreciates Foyle's War, Morse, Midsomer Murders, and Inspector Lewis.",1273449600,17,312,5.659574468085107
2699748,5,B000L21286,By all means purchase this DVD. We ordered it and immediately ordered all Ruth Rendell Mysteries. Only wish we could have purchased a complete set rather than buying separate series. Ruth Rendell is a great writer.,1235260800,4,214,4.972222222222222
2699749,4,B000L21286,"The Ruth Rendell mysteries on DVD are wonderful.  I greatly enjoyed these, as I do most British mysteries.  They are well acted, well done, scenery is lovely....they bring the books to life.",1223856000,3,190,4.90625
2699750,4,B000L21286,"""The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Series 1,"" begins the long-awaited release on DVD of the popular British television psychological crime dramas based on the best-selling work of Ruth Rendell, surely one of the queens of current-day suspense/thrillers/mysteries/police procedurals.  The series, which was made by the British TV firm Granada for Britain's Independent Television (ITV) debuted in Britain in 1987. It appeared in the United States in syndication on various public broadcasting stations in the late 1990's.  The series at hand, a three-volume boxed set, gives us two full-length mysteries, and features Colin Firth in the first of them.  They are:

1. ""Master of the Moor."" Since boyhood, Stephen Whalby (Colin Firth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Movie/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia! The Movie </a>&nbsp;;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition </a>) has taken refuge on the village of Vangmoor's wild, windy, spacious moor, a landscape of rocks, heather and bogs, in order to escape trouble at home.  But, trouble follows him there in his adulthood, as a series of women turn up brutally murdered.  Based upon his intimate knowledge of the landscape, he is naturally the prime suspect.  Firth ably carries this full-length thriller.
2. ""Vanity Dies Hard."" In the town of Salstead, the happy marriage of wealthy, aging heiress Alice Fielding (Eleanor David,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Detective-Complete-Collection/dp/B001HZ4K80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Detective: Complete Collection</a>), to a much younger man destroys the heiress's friendship with a local florist, Nesta Drage, whose business fails, and who then disappears.  The bride goes looking for her old friend.  Also features Peter Egan, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Spy-3pc-VHS/dp/B00004WGBP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Spy (3pc) [VHS</a>]) and Leslie Phillips,  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer-s-Stone/dp/B000W74EQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone </a>).  Full-length.
3. ""The Secret House of Death.""  Susan Townsend (Amanda Redman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspicion/dp/B000GNOGZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspicion</a>), a newly divorced single mother and working writer, prefers to remain aloof from the gossipy housewives of her upper-crust suburban subdivision.  But when she discovers the bodies of adulterous lovers next door, her quiet life vanishes.  About an hour and a half long.
4. ""The Double."" A shorter production (less than an hour long) and a less powerful one.  Lovely, nave young Lisa (Camilla Power) believes the old superstition that if a person's double appears, it signals the person's coming death.  And suddenly Zoe, her apparent double appears, to make a play for Lisa's boyfriend Peter Milton (Jason Flemyng,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lock-Stock-and-Two-Smoking-Barrels/dp/B000GGSMC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels </a>).  What's going on, who is Zoe, and can Lisa survive?

The first three episodes are strong, and have staying power. I discover I've held them in passive memory since I saw them on a local PBS station.  The last, ""The Double,"" is sadly forgettable.  But, finally, it wouldn't be me reviewing this boxed set if I didn't now give you the subtitle report.  And, unfortunately there are none, while all of the author's well-bred characters speak softly.  So some of us may have to struggle for comprehension.  It's worth it though.",1219622400,6,3939,7.0929752066115705
2699751,2,B000L21286,"""The Double"", which is the shortest episode in this set, is completely unsatisfactory.  It has no particular structure, no particular ending, no particular character development.  The sub-plot involving the stocks seems to be irrelevant.
