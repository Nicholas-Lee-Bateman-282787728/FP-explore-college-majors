4165678,5,B003Q6DQKG,"I realize many fans complain that these dvd sets are too expensive and I agree, but I'm still very thankful Amazon's bringing back some of the old excellent nicktoons that I enjoyed through my  young carefree years surfing and sunbathing on the beach, and I plan to keep buying them.

At this rate I'll be 35 before they complete the 10 seasons of the ""Rugrats"" >_<

 CatDog Season-1 contains four dvd's, Audio and picture quality in these dvd's is very good and plays perfectly in my Sony 400 Dvd carousel unit. CatDog could be one of the most underated nicktoons ever created, its not psychological humor like ""Hey Arnold"" and its not as endearing to fans as say ""Doug"" or the ""Rugrats"" but it does hold its own against the likes of ""Spongebob Square pants"". Speaking of Spongebob Tom Kenny who does the voice for Spongebob also did the voice for Dog.

EDIT: Amazon now offers the complete collection of CatDog

CatDog has:  Tom Kinney as voice talent, Derek Drymon with writing and directing credits, and Paul Tibbit with animation credits.  They all had to pay their dues in lesser cartoons somewhere before shooting to the stratosphere--this is one of those launch pads.  While the premise is completely silly, and even more difficult to explain to an 8-year old, this series is fun from start to finish, from the title song all the way through to the end of each episode--at least for me.  That is because I tend to like slap-stick, I like reluctant buddy movies (i.e., ""Odd Couple""), I don't mind stock characters, and I even like the frequent predictable gags and plots in this one.  It's that they are all done well enough that I find that am watching episodes all the way through again on Amazon (with the aforementioned 8-year old).",1375401600,,913,4.746835443037975
