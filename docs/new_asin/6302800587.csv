514837,5,6302800587,"This is the first gay movie I ever saw and was totally absorbed by it.  I never saw drag queens perform, (fabulous!), never saw men kiss on screen before, (wow!), and never realized there really was gay life outside the  small rural area that I was from.  It was, and still is the best gay themed  movie I have seen, an emotional roller coaster of laughter and tears. If you  are gay, or someone you love is gay, this is the movie to watch.",947548800,4,440,4.190476190476191
514838,5,6302800587,This movies is incredible.  when i first came out i was amazed there was a movies that portrayed gays in such a positive light.  unlike most movies torch shows us that no matter who you are that we all have a problem  finding that elusive perfect love.  mathew brodrick should be commended for  portraying arolds lover after he portyayed the son on broadway.  i have had  this movie for years and never get tired of watching it.,944179200,6,428,4.48051948051948
514839,5,6302800587,"This was my favorite movie of all time. I am a 51 year old mother and grandmother, am not gay, but love to be in the presence of truly gay men. I have one who is my very best friend, and I wish I could find more. But this  little town I live in is SICK when it comes to that. I have been searching  EVERYWHERE for this movie. The copy I had got eaten up by my old VCR. This  is the first time I have come close to locating another copy. You can't by  it thur the usual means. Anne Bancroft as Harvey's mother makes this movie.  But no one can out do Harvey. He is so unique and funny and I just love  everything I've seen him in. Which I must say, is NOT ENOUGH!!!  Of course  Matthew Broderick is great also, but my hat still goes off to Harvey!!!!  THE GREATEST OF ALL TIMES!!",939427200,3,778,3.8734177215189876
514840,5,6302800587,"This is an offbeat story of a gay female impersonator in his seach for love and a committed relationship. Primarily psychological drama with excellent insights and incisive dialog. Anne Bancroft is great as the  Jewish mother, and Harvey Fierstein, who wrote the original play, brings so  much angst and personality to his portrayal of the main character that I  just couldn't help wishing I knew someone like that in real life. Highly  recommended if you want to know more about a lifestyle most people have  never seen.",933552000,37,521,4.942528735632184
514841,5,6302800587,"Harvey Fierstein, Anne Bancroft, Matthew Broderick and Brian Kerwin combine in a bitter-sweet comedy-drama set in the 1970's, concluding in 1980.  The ""Trilogy"" is a collection of 3 specific pieces blended  together telling the saga of Arnold Beckoff (Fierstein).  The story  revolves around love, relationships and family - something everyone can  relate to.  It was a movie before it's time when it premiered in 1988.  It  is straight-forward and to the point.  It will make you laugh and cry and  understand the true meaning of love and respect.  Harvey Fierstein &  Anne Bancroft (Arnold's Mother) are outstanding in their roles.  A must see  for anyone trying to understand the complexity of love.  A well-done  adaption to the screen from theatre.  Add this video to your collection!",921024000,11,789,5.134920634920635
514842,4,6302800587,"Somewhat of a black comedy, this dramatic adaptation of a truly wonderful play has a permanent place in my heart and on my video shelves.  Fierstein is at his campy best, and captivates with his heartfelt portrayal of an  aging drag queen searching for love before it's too late.  I forgot to  breathe during the cemetery scene, where Arnold's strained relationship  with his mother reaches critical mass.  The film's only unfortunate  detraction is that Matthew Broderick is a little too pretty opposite  Fierstein, and isn't quite convincing as a gay man.  Have the Kleenex handy  though -- the story's honest scrutiny of human emotions is tough on the  soul.  A must-see for everyone!",913161600,3,687,4.982300884955753

I was a teenager when I first saw Torch Song Trilogy and it was my first time to realize that two men could thrive in their search for love despite their many obstacles. It was the first time I'd seen two men kiss on screen. Anne Bancroft was superb! Matthew Broderick, who had originally played David the adopted son in the stage version, was excellent. I've related to Arnold in so many ways. Even as a teenager I felt a connection with his character. Granted I've never performed in drag but he put his heart into everything he did and came out a survivor. The film was funny, sad, happy and sentimental in so many way. And the last scene with Arnold holding his treasures... gets me every time. I waited ages for the DVD release. I'm hoping Blu-Ray is around the corner!

I liked it when I first saw the film in 1988 better than I did watching it in 2015. It is definitely a ""play"" made into a movie. Acting is a bit ""BIG,"" as needs to be on stage, but too much and over the top for the big screen. I still highly recommend the movie. A solid 4.5 stars!

Quote: Arnold - ""A ugly person who goes after a pretty person gets nothing but trouble. But a pretty person who goes after a ugly person gets at least cab fare."" (so VERY true!)

Poignantly and without being preachy it simply relates the trials and tribulations of being (1) a minority [gay] in a straight world; (2) being confused and/or unable to accept one's sexual orientation; and (3) how to grow up gay without the usual (or at least without any more than the usual) teenage angst.
While much of the story is context limited (nothing you wouldn't expect in any film produced in a particular time/place), there are elements of this story that are timeless, instructive and invaluable. For instance, the dialogues between mother (Anne Bancroft, who presents a phenomenal portrayal as the typical Jewish mother) and son (Harvey Fierstein, who is amazingly multi-talented). The film is worth watching if only for those dialogues - and, yet, there is so much more.  This is one of those films I can return to again and again and catch something new, or see a different point of view, each time I watch it. To me, that is the hallmark of a film worth owning.
I only wish I had the opportunity to see a production of this on the stage . . ..

It is a complex, heartfelt, funny, heartbreaking, satisfying story with great characters that develop and grow over a period of a few years. People face their challenges and triumph but the story leaves possible endings to the imagination, after all life gives no guarantees and none are offered here, only hopefulness. Judging by how these people go about assertively facing life, one is left feeling that all will be fine; these people will continue to expand and be strong. One is left with a feeling of comfort, warmth and admiration for how these people grow into themselves and their lives, and, finally, one is left with a trust in life.",1413244800,,739,4.873015873015873

Arnold's (Fierstein) life is chronicled in this engaging and hilarious (and yes, sad too) story of a gay man in New York who is a drag queen and, like everyone, looking for true love amidst all the family angst and social challenges of the day. Anne Bancroft plays ""the mother"" - she's awesome.

515413,3,6302800587,"On the stage, Torch Song Trilogy had a 4-hour run. The movie running time is that of 121 minutes. How much is amiss? Only those who saw the play can say. Mostly, the movie showcases Harvey Fierstein's acting and, believe it or not, his singing. It is gay nightclub singing, it's true, but the sound of his voice is really hard to bear, no matter if he's just speaking or, what is worse, singing. Perhaps Harvey's greatest gifts lie in his writing for the theater since the play is a Tony award winner and La Cage aux Folle one of Broadway's longest running musicals, not to mention his most recent book for the Broadway musical Kinky Boots. Torch Song Trilogy, the play, must be a lot better since, I believe, the performer does not overshadow the playwright.",1395360000,,759,4.547445255474453

515433,4,6302800587,"A notable film on several levels. First, it was way ahead of the U.S. in being a relatively mainstream film that treated gay men as people of depth, value, humor and worth making a film about. (Although there is sad irony in the fact this huge hit play took so long to make it to the screen that AIDS had already totally altered the landscape by the time of its release. That's something the film only notes in the closing credits, and gives it a bit of a 'rose colored glasses' hue).

But beyond any politics or social significance this is also a very well acted, funny and moving look at one man, Arnold, (played by the unique and charismatic Harvey Firestein, who wrote the play and screenplay) as he looks for love  both romantic and familial in a sometimes very cold world.

If Firestein's performance can occasionally feel theatrical, it's also entirely appropriate for the starting-to-age drag queen performer he plays.
What's wonderful is how Firestein always keeps the humanity under Arnold's occasional flamboyance very alive, as does Anne Bancroft as his 'difficult' mother. Later in her career Bancroft could tend towards theatricality on screen as well, but she tones it down just enough to feel real here, and anyway, lets face it, next to a drag queen, who is more innately dramatic than a Jewish mother? (I grew up with one, trust me).

Matthew Broderick and Brian Kerwin also do very good work in support, Broderick as a sexy but understated young man totally at ease with his sexuality, and Kerwin as a confused bi-sexual trying to work out his. While never rising to the level of a great film (the direction is very
straightforward and bland, there's almost a TV movie look to it, it never completely surpasses it's theatrical origins), it's certainly a good, touching, human, and important one  although to a generation growing up with the reality of gay marriage and deeper integration of gay people into society, some of the historical importance may be lost. But not the essential, timeless embrace of kindness, love, respect and understanding.",1388102400,,2067,4.8441926345609065

The story is about the courage to be who we are and remain true to oneself and those we love, to accept that we are never 100% faultless but that despite this we can still love ourselves and others as the people we truly are rather than as an image of what we think we should be or as others think we should be.  There are many films that are moving or that touch us and make us think but there are very few that are truly inspiring and that change our lives when we have experienced them.  For me there are only three films that have had that affect on me, To Kill a Mockingbird, 12 Angry Men and Torch Song Trilogy.  Everyone should see this film.",1350518400,,807,4.180645161290323

Arnold is quite a rare character in literature in that he is an unabashed drag queen that avoids the stereotypical portrayal. He's a person struggling to find a long-term relationship, something relatable regardless of sexuality or gender.

515541,5,6302800587,"I finally got a chance to see this movie and I really enjoyed it. Well, as much as I can enjoy a movie that is very depressing! Estelle Getty did this play on Broadway and it was this story and all the friends she made that made her a lifelong supporter of gay rights and AIDS research. It's only too bad I didn't get to see her in the movie since I didn't get to see the play. Anne Bancroft played a very strong mother to Harvey Fierstein's gay son, however, and their relationship was heartbreaking. I know people with relationships like that because the parent (or friend or whoever) just won't understand, and I wish those people would watch a movie like this with an open mind. But not only will they not watch it with an open mind, they won't watch it at all!

I think the final third of the movie (Arnold's  relationship with his mother) had the biggest impact on me and was the part of the movie I enjoyed the most, even though it just about made me cry. I was almost ready to believe that Arnold was about to get through his mother's thick head when he described his pain at the loss of his partner (after she said how dare he compare his loss to her husband!), but alas, no. Too bad.

I don't know why this was rated R. A few bad words but that was about it. No icky sex scenes (that they think sell movies but a lot of us really don't want to watch). I guess the rating is because of the controversial subject matter. Well, the subject matter that was slightly more controversial back then than it is today.",1334880000,,1518,4.209621993127148

I feel sorry for the ""Young Ones"" of today because they will never know the excitement(s), the pleasures and sometimes the bittersweet taste of life that many of us have been lucky enough to live in real life.

515629,5,6302800587,"It's somewhat ridiculous to think that the best movie to touch upon subjects and issues important today in the gay civil rights struggle was made over 20 years ago...but it's true.

In 'Torch Song Trilogy', Harvey Fierstein had the courage to not only tackle issues like homophobia and gay bashing, gay adoption and gay marriage but to tackle them through the eyes of a drag queen. I do not say that because I think drag queens should not be part of our movement but because there are people who feel they should be relegated to the background. It would have been easier for Mr. Fierstein then, and even now, to portray the character of Arnold as a ""normal"" guy (i.e. not in drag, and not flamboyant).

Mr. Fierstein's excellent writing and great performance, however, handled each of these subjects so well and gave his character so much pride and dignity and compassion that it would be hard for even the staunchest of gay conservatives to deny him and his movie a place at the top of gay-themed movies and performances.

'Torch Song Trilogy' was and still is ahead of its time...and I feel it has yet to be honored for the brilliant film that it is. The fact that this film from 1988 can still speak to us, especially today with the struggle for the recognition and respect of gay families, is reason enough to applaud the work of Mr. Fierstein.

It's been well over a decade since I first watched this film as a teenager and I remember thinking afterwards how no movie can ever touch on so much in such a great way ever again. Now, having reached my 30's, I still have that same thought.

Thank you Mr. Fierstein!",1254096000,,1617,4.523972602739726

515631,5,6302800587,"I love ""Torch Song Trilogy"". Based on the stage play of the same name and written by Harvey Fierstein, this was one of the first films to honestly portray homosexuals in a positive and honest light. Harvery plays Arnold, a drag queen, who meets a young, beautiful man, played to perfection by Matthew Broderick, and they eventually fall in love and ""adopt"" a young man. The jist of the story is between Arnold and his Jewish/Catholic mother, who doesn't approve of her son's homosexual lifestyle. The scenes between Harvey and Anne Bancroft, who plays his mother, are written to perfection, as these scenes are honest in their portrayal of a mother who wants her son to be straight and have a nice home, wife, and children, yet when the mother realizes this will never be, strong, confrontational encounters between mother and son erupt. Everything about the movie from the other characters and scenes are excellent, but its the chemistry between Bancroft and Fierstein that makes the movie work.
 I first saw this movie while in college, and have waited years for its release on DVD, and it's finally here. We all should watch this movie, not just for sheer enjoyment, but for good, educational reasons as we discover all families have issues, and families with gay sons are no different. The message here is that gay people cannot change. The problem isn't with the person who's gay, but with the parent who doesn't accept their child's homosexuality.
 There is also a fantastic commentary from Harvey on the making of the film, and the movie is in widescreen format, and is digitally remastered from the original studio print. I wish more films like this would be made today.",1239580800,,1678,4.843205574912892

If this movie had been properly advertised, I would have been PERFECT for it's time, making movies like ""Making Love,"" ""Parting Glances"", and ""'Broke Back Mountain""

Harvey Fierstein wrote, directed, and produced this Broadway adaption of his fine work from the stage, and brought to the big screen, SEAMLESSLY, although Harvey of course, in his adorable self-deprecating humour, denies it all, making his quiet private demeanor a stark contrast to his ""Diva"" like status as a performer.

It's just no use to even try to explain this movie, for I personally, PERSONALLY believe one must be a young gay male in this country to have been raised from the 50's to the early 70's, when homosexuality was a ""sickness"" that must be cured.

Shudder...

Trilogy shows that gay people are just as vulnerable to hurt, joy, and humanity as straight people.  Fierstein's character isn't afraid to take on the world even when it is hostile and violent toward him.  He displays strength and compassion and never loses his sense of humor, no matter how despairing and bleak it gets.  Now don't get me wrong, I love BBM but Arnold Beckoff has strength and resilience in a way that Ennis Del Mar could only dream of.  Mountain was a wonderful film but like all major gay love stories it always has to end tragically with the death of one of the characters.  Trilogy showed that while Arnold experienced the loss of a loved one, he also fought and gained an old flame who finally came to his senses.  It would be nice for mainstream gay themed films to have characters that are unafraid to take on the world and fight for that respect.  Instead we get gay characters who are the subjects of ill humor or tragedies that make people think twice about falling in love.  I can also add that this is one of the better films of the overblown 1980s (I also believe the 80s was probably one of the worst decades for movies).",1207872000,,1328,4.401639344262295

And as if the tale wasn't enough, that fantastic narration by Mr. Fierstein at the end of the film was just by far and away the best ""special feature"" I have ever had the pleasure of hearing!  (Normally I avoid listening to a narrative over a movie I have only just watched!!)

And although I think the late and great Anne Bankroft was superb as the mother, I confess I would like to have seen Estelle Getty in the performance extolled by the author.

As a totally ""square"" viewer of this performance, I would hazzard a guess that in another 50 years or so ""Torch Song"" will have reached the level of film classics.  The death scene of Matthew Broderick in the story was simply devastating!

515669,4,6302800587,"Writen by and starring Harvey Fierstein, this 1988 film was adapted from the stage play.  It's set in the New York world of gays in the 1970s, before AIDS.  But even then, life was certainly not bliss for Harvey Fierstein.  From early childhood Harvey knew he was different.  As an adult, he works as a feminine impersonator and has accepted himself, but every day he has to confront his gayness.  He uses humor to cover up his hurts and that's why this film can be considered a comedy as well as a drama.  But even though I laughed out loud at certain points, it is still a poignant and moving story of an individual's search for love and respect.

There are two men in Harvey's life.  One is Ed, a bisexual who can't quite come to terms with living as a gay man.  He actually gets married and Harvey and the new ""love of his life"", Alan, played by Mathew Broderick are invited for a visit.  Naturally there are complications.  But the two men resolve them, move to a new apartment and make plans to adopt a 15-year old gay boy.  It's then that tragedy strikes and Alan is viciously murdered.

The most important relationship, however, is Harvey's relationship with his mother, played by Ann Brancroft.  She's supposed to be Jewish with all the Jewish stereotypical expressions.  Sorry, but I didn't get it.  She comes across as a caricature rather than a real person.  And, had she played the role better, I might even have had a small amount of sympathy for her.  This didn't happen.  All I did was be amused as she tried to act Jewish.  It's a good role. It just needed a better actress.

With the exception of Ann Bankcroft's acting, I really liked this film.  Harvey Fierstein is outstanding and it clear that the role comes straight from his heart.  The rest of the cast did a good job and the cinematography was good. As a side note, part of this movie was filmed across the street from where I live.  I even remember when they were filming it.  It depicts the neighborhood as a dangerous one.  That is not true at all.  But, after all, this is the movies.

I definitely recommend Torch Song Trilogy and give it a high recommendation.  It depicts a time and a place in the world of gay men that has unfortunately ended when AIDS came on the scene.  I just wish that the casting would have been better for the mother's role.",1161648000,5,2331,4.429245283018868
515670,5,6302800587,"Harvey Fierstein's play that won a Tony translates beautifully onto the screen. Even though the movie is only two hours long-- the play was about four-- he captures the essence of this groundbreaking play. Although we previously had had BOYS IN THE BAND, THE STAIRCASE and similar plays/movies about gay people in America, no writer before had said (that I can recall) that gays should adopt children, gays should be monogamous, gays should be honest with themselves, their families and everybody else, gays had nothing to be ashamed of, gays were good people. Fierstein says all that and more in this most seminal work. When the history of the gay movement in the late 20th Century is written, this play/movie will be remembered with the likes of ANGELS IN AMERICA as lasting art. I saw the play on broadway years ago. It was the shortest four hours of my life. Both the play and the movie will make you laugh; they will make you cry.

Of course Fierstein, who both wrote the screenplay and plays Arnold Beckoff a/k/a Virginia Ham, gets a tad dramatic at times and his addressing the audience works better on stage than in the film; and maybe the great actress Anne Bancroft overacts as his b----y mother. These are just table crumbs, however, from a magnificent visual feast.

All the actors to a person are superb, and the soundtrack is worth owning--Fierstein, who sings his songs live, has a voice no lower than Marlene Dietrich's and just as good.

Fierstein also does a commentary on the DVD of this film, offering interesting insights and tidbits about the making of TORCH SONG TRILOGY, a film you will want to see again and again.",1144195200,7,1639,4.723776223776224

It identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it. This movie is inspirational, comical, sad, and dramatic. There is no other movie of its kind, and no other movie compares.

Not to mention the French coming out with really raunchy coming out gay pieces like Wild Reeds and Come Undone.

Thus, when I decided to watch this 1988 movie(due to boredom), I was a bit more reserved and wasn't expecting so much from the outcome due to the fact that there has been many movies since its time.

Alas, after watching it for almost 2 hours, I have to admit - IT was GOOD! I could not say that it was good for its time back in 88 since I was eight back then. But now after watching so many gay movies, this is one good piece of writing and film adaptation! Superb

515701,5,6302800587,"Finally, I have seen a gay movie which is not merely about the misery of being dumped by a gay lover or trying to come out in a family.
Torch Song Trilogy is a biographical work about the life of the protagonist drag queen, Arnold. The movie starts humourously with the mother's discovery of the son hiding in a closet and trying to beautifying himself with her make-up. The mother yelled, ""What are you doing in the ---"". Then the mother knew what was going on.
The movie can be basically divided into three parts (that's why it's titled trilogy) - his career as a professional drag queen (or politically correct - a female impersonator), during which he knew a bisexual man; his falling in love with a middle class boy who is still uncontaminated by the world. He, however, was sadly, killed by hateful discrimination. Finally, the movie has a touch of adopting a (gay) son and brings out the issue of gay parenting. The movie ends with a fight, not a reconciliation, between the mother and the gay son. Each part of the movie tells you the life and the bumpy road Arnold was living through at the moment. The movie does not depict it in a pitiful way, or else, it lets the plot bring out the emotio spontaneously to the audience. The dialogues are clever, symbolic and witty. The acting is professional and does not go over the top. The director deals with the fantastic scripts carefully and the final scene of Arnold holding the three most valuable things in his life in a chair is simply self-effacing.
Torch Song Trilogy is a gay classic drama. There is nothing pretentious. The movie does not ask for your pity for Arnold's tragic life, but your understanding of what he has been through.",1089849600,,1696,4.563934426229508

I was 20 (I'm 32 now) and only a few weeks before I'd come out to my mother as Gay.  Dealing with my mother's fears and still unable to tell my five older brothers or my father, I joined a Gay student group at my university.  I was terrified because though I knew what was going on in my life, I had not yet met or knew anyone who was Gay.  My first night with the student organization we got together at a young lesbian couple's home and watched ""Harold And Maude"" (a classic!) and ""Torch Song Trilogy.""  The next day while describing Torch Song to my mother I burst into uncontrollable sobs.  This was the first time my mother had seen me cry in years and she knew she had to watch this movie with me.  I rented it and we watched it and my mother and I cried together - she knew what I was going through in a way I could never explain to her.  This movie is an absolute MUST SEE.  BTW, the minor flaw is that there is a very annoying buzzing during the initial monologue with Arnold and also during the conversation and monologue with Ed and Arnold in Arnold's dressing room.  Otherwise the rest of the movie is a gem.  Also, contrary to what another reviewer stated, I did NOT find a single scene edited from the DVD version that was in the original VHS version - the DVD copy is identical to the orginal down to the second - 121 minutes.",1089331200,3,1515,4.115646258503402

515724,5,6302800587,"I love this movie because it effectively portrays a wide scope of emotion. Pay attention to Arnold's many facial expressions and the words he chooses to speak. You will see a person ""acting"" genuinely. Humans are the only animal who fake emotions. We are so afraid that someone might actually ""read"" us. What we're doing, however, is closing ourselves off from the delights of experiencing life in its fullest; accepting all of its happinesses and sufferings. This movie is a good example of how people act when they're not faking it. These moments are best seen in Arnold's infrequent direct narration to the camera.
Furthermore, I see a gay man struggling with society's rejection of who he is while endeavoring to embrace his own self anyhow. This is a lesson for society to learn. Why do we feel the need to make gays feel unacceptable in our society? Don't we comprehend how painful it is to be disenfranchised?
There is so much more, too, like the fight with his mother, wherein she reveals to him that she had been waiting, for years, for him to trust her with the knowledge of his lifestyle. He had always thought her to be unable to cope with his ""differences,"" never giving her a chance to be an active part of his life. As a result, he goes through painful experiences without her support.

515726,4,6302800587,"There is a review which criticises the DVD release, stating that it is not widescreen, and scenes have been removed. While I cannot comment on removed scenes, I can say that the DVD is in widescreen (1:78) and not the full screen cropped version that the reviewer stated.  What is also important is that the widescreen is anamorphic.  Even better is that the film has been beautifully restored, and the transfer is great for a film of its year (1988). A 5.1 mix is provided on the DVD, but isn't that important because it is more a dialogue driven film.  I did notice a constant hum throughout the film on my surround speakers, and wonder if this is fault of the soundtrack. Special features are limited to an audio commentary and trailer.  However, better than nothing!
Torch Song Trilogy is a funny and sad film about the struggles of a homosexual who works as a female impersonator at night.  Matthew Broderick stars as one of his lovers, and is worth seeing just to see him in a very different role.  A DVD that is worth owning for sure.",1085616000,3,1041,4.51063829787234
515727,5,6302800587,"In 1988, the film version of the Tony Award-winning, landmark play ""Torch Song Trilogy"", which was written by the outspoken and very witty Harvey Fierstein, was released to theaters.  Written originally as three separate one-act plays between 1978 and 1979 (""The International Stud"", ""Fugue in a Nursery"" and ""Widows and Children First""), Harvey Fierstein combined them into the more familiar three-act play ""Torch Song Trilogy"" in 1981 since each one-act play focused on the life of a gay man named Arnold (played by Harvey Fierstein), who is a gay drag-show entertainer.  In the first act, Arnold meets a stranger at a bar named Ed (Brian Kerwin). A precarious relationship develops quickly between Ed and Arnold, but Ed also wants to marry a woman named Laurel (Karen Young).  In the second act, Arnold meets a young man named Alan (Matthew Broderick) at the club where Arnold performs.  A long-term relationship develops between Arnold and Alan until an unexpected tragedy occurs.  The third act focuses on Arnold taking care of a teenaged son, David (Eddie Castrodad) that he & Alan had adopted, as well as Arnold's ongoing difficulties with his mother (Anne Bancroft).
With excellent dialog, engaging personalities and superb acting, ""Torch Song Trilogy"" is a fantastic film, demonstrating not only the love that exists within gay couples, but also the very real difficulties that many gay men face in their daily lives, including the all-too-often difficulties with family members who cannot accept them for who they are.  Harvey Fierstein's unique voice adds a special flare to his drag show performances, as well as to his arguments with his mother.  Anne Bancroft's performance is superb and emotional.  Matthew Broderick did a wonderful portraying Alan.  Interestingly, he had played the teenaged son David when ""Torch Song Trilogy"" was being performed on stage as a play.  Brian Kerwin and Karen Young also portray their roles well.  Other significant characters in the film include Bertha Venation (Charles Pierce), Marina Del Rey (Alex Vera), the young Arnold (Benji Schulman) and Murray (Kevin Page).  Overall, I rate ""Torch Song Trilogy"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  It's especially great to be able to watch the film on widescreen DVD.",1085443200,34,2247,5.1740331491712706
515728,5,6302800587,"While this film is somewhat dated now, it does a very interesting job at showing gay relationships in emotional complexity -- the world of the drag queen, the world of those who are not quite out, and the problems faced by couples in terms of basic everyday human relationships.
Arnold (Harvey Fierstein) is the central character, a drag-queen/playwright who is never quite accepted by his family (the mother, played by Anne Bancroft, is wonderfully performed).  He goes through a three-act story (Trilogy) showing his first encounters with Ed (Brian Kerwin), the not-quite-out school teacher; his long-term relationship with Alan (played by a very nervous looking Matthew Broderick) which ends in tragedy, and finally the adopted son/mother/reacquaintance with Ed.
The one-liners are rattled off with ease, and the scenes are developed in fairly predictable yet well crafted ways.  This is a film derived from a stage play that, for the most part, predates the AIDS crisis, so this is not mentioned at all in the film.  It does deal with discrimination and violence in peripheral ways, but this isn't central to the story, except for the inter-family relationships, primarily with Arnold and his mother.
A great film!",1085356800,,1218,5.204081632653061
515729,5,6302800587,"I was delighted to find that at long last, ""Torch Song Trilogy"" was finally on DVD. If you are not familiar with this film, it is a must see. A delightful, funny, gentle and moving film. For those not familiar, to put it in the context of time, it was one of the first movies with a positive image of gay characters.
I go way back with Torch Song. In the 1970's I saw, ""International Stud"" in the Village (I believe it was a theatre on Bleecker St.) I also remember seeing it as an entire triology off off Broadway when it was presented by the Glines (I seem to remember that the ticket cost $5 with a coupon, or was it 2-for $10 with coupon?)
Harvey Fierstien is to be applauded. We take for granted the more positive image we see of gays today (although apparently, we have progressed from the film images of where we kill ourselves, to the television images of where we are only acceptable if we are making straight people happy  and so that they can marry each other, while we ourselves are not allowed to get married).
Torch Song represents hope, love, and pride.
A big plus on the DVD is the not to be missed commentary by Harvey.
Thank you Harvey for writing this. Thank you for being a pioneer. Gez ... where is this review going? Somewhere in the background a drag queen is beginning to sing the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic!""",1084406400,102,1335,4.318725099601593
515730,5,6302800587,"Harvey Fierstein's classic film about a gay man's funny, moving quest to create his own family finally arrives on DVD! Adapted from his series of three plays, Torch Song Trilogy focuses on the life of Harvey's alter ego, Arnold Beckoff, a drag performer.  In chapter one, Arnold's career is moving along well, but he dreams of having a family of his own - a family who, unlike his parents, will love and respect Arnold for who he is.  Arnold meets Ed (the studly Brian Kerwin) in a bar, and they begin a relationship, but Ed, a self-identified bisexual, is not quite as comfortable with his gay side as Arnold would like.  Ed's internalized homophobia and desire to keep up an outwardly heterosexual image prove too much for the couple, and Arnold finds himself single again.
In chapter two, Arnold becomes involved with Alan (Matthew Broderick), a former hustler now working as a model.  Arnold is leery of the handsome young man at first, but Alan's persistence wears him down, and the two become a couple.  The pairing is successful, to the point where they begin the process of adopting a child together.  Meanwhile, Ed has married a woman, who contacts Arnold and Alan, inviting them to spend a weekend in the country.  Tensions run high, with each of the foursome checking out the competition, and the weekend turns out to be eye-opening for all involved.  Back in the city, life appears to be working out for Arnold and Alan, but as the men prepare to bring their adopted son home, tragedy strikes, in the form of a gay bashing, and Arnold's world once again comes crashing down.
Chapter three finds Arnold, his new 15-year-old gay son David, and now-separated houseguest Ed, preparing for a visit from Arnold's widowed mother (Anne Bancroft). Arnold and his mother finally let out all the anger and frustration that have built up over the years, battling over such basic issues as honesty, respect, and the devaluing of the emotions of others.  While many issues of their relationship are left unresolved, mother and son come to an understanding, and part with an increase in caring and respect for each other.  At the conclusion, Arnold is left to contemplate the joys and sorrows of the past, and the promise and possibilities of his future.
This film is a gay touchstone.  No matter what stage of the coming out process you are in, the messages of self acceptance and standing up for your right to be loved and respected for who you are should be affirming and motivating.  Through Arnold's experiences, it is made clear that life is most fulfilling when you find your identity, choose your path, and insist that others deal with the real you, rather than allowing others to dictate your public persona.
I just received my copy of the new DVD from Amazon, and I am very pleased with the release.  The copy I received is a widescreen transfer of a very good print, and is the same version of the film that I saw on the big screen.  In addition, the commentary track by the always-entertaining Harvey Fierstein is wonderful - filled with anecdotes about the history of the plays and film, tidbits and gossip about the film's cast and crew, and descriptions of scenes that were cut from the film due to time constraints.  I would love to have seen those deleted scenes and alternate takes included on the DVD, as well as existing footage of the original plays, and/or the award shows in which the stage productions were winners. These are minor quibbles, however - on the whole, the release is an excellent one, and I highly recommend it to those who are already fans of the film and of Harvey Fierstein, as well as to those who have not yet had the pleasure of seeing Torch Song Trilogy.",1083974400,,3696,4.682098765432099

515757,5,6302800587,"Torch Song trilogy was a life defining moment for me. It showed me that the world was open to homosexuals and that we could lead productive lives. You have so many different types of people in this movie that it breaks the ground of stereotypes by showing that one class of people is not definable by one single act. It teaches a lesson that I still hold true to my heart, and that is that you treat everyone with the simple respect that you know that they are a human being, and that the people that don't show you that simple respect don't have a place in your life. It makes you happy, and it breaks your heart when you see families that define love as not something between two people but something between two people of the opposite sex. Love knows no boundaries and to limit Love is to limit yourself. The movie does goes through a myriad of situations but it never lies to the heart and always stays true to life. Anne Bancroft is amazing in her portayal of a mother who doesn't understand but still loves here family. Harvey Fierstein is an icon with all his nuances and quircks but is always throwing out one liners that I still quote to this day in everyday conversation. Matthew Broderick is adorable and what else can you say. The music was my first exposure to Ella Fitzgerald which I will forever be thankful for because it makes my heart soar and the musical numbers in the movie make me laugh. This movie is one of my favorites, maybe because it meant so much, allowed me to come out to my family, but I think that it can touch everyone's heart and help anyone through any situation because you learn to focus on yourself.

515759,4,6302800587,"You don't have to be gay to love this surprising and unpretentious little movie, which should appeal to the hidden sense of ""outsider"" in most viewers. The story of an overweight, overly emotional, gravel-voiced and very unglamorous drag queen who seeks true love in a society that prizes appearance over values, TORCH SONG TRILOGY is a hilarious and often poignantly touching film with a break-out performance by Harvey Fierstein, who adapts his Tony-award winning stage script and performance for the screen with considerable aplomb.
In addition to Fierstein's brilliantly honest script and self-depreciating performance, the film also offers knock-out performances by Anne Bancroft as Fierstein's Jewish-Mother-From-Hell and Matthew Broderick as his much younger and somewhat unlikely lover; although not in the same league with these three, supporting players Brian Kerwin strikes the right note as Fierstein's tepidly bisexual ex-lover and Karen Young is quite good as Kerwin's understandably neurotic wife.  Although the film script does depart from the stage script, it remains faithful in spirit, and the film as a whole is reasonably--although not outstandingly--served by director Paul Bogart.
The film abounds with quotable lines (""I'm the pretty one"") that will keep you laughing, but although it concludes on a ""hope for the future"" note TORCH SONG TRILOGY is not all grins and giggles by a long shot: the dramatic underpinnings are deadly serious, and at least one or two scenes will leave most viewers as shocked, angered, and heart-broken as the characters it so vividly displays.  While the film isn't BOYS IN THE BAND, I think it is the only gay-themed film to date that actually approaches the artistic and emotional impact of BOYS IN THE BAND; more over, most viewers will probably find it more accessible, and many will be surprised to by a realization of much TORCH has influenced cinema's portrayal of gay characters from the 1980s right up to the present. It deserves considerably more praise and attention than it has received. Strongly recommended.",1011916800,23,2074,5.320121951219512
515760,5,6302800587,"This film should be the star attraction in any course given on the appreciation of gay film.  It works on every level, both humorous and dramatic.  And you don't even have to necessarily be gay to appreciate it, though it does help.  Harvey Fierstein is in a word, wonderful.  His characterization of Arnold is bang-on from start to finish.  Funny, self-depreciating and all too human he's truly amazing.  And the supporting cast is wonderful.  The very straight Matthew Broderick has never been more appealing as his partner Alan.  What gay man wouldn't want Matthew Broderick as a partner?  I definitely would.  Ferris Bueller grows up and the results are very impressive indeed.  The marvelous Anne Bancroft lights up the screen.  There are just not enough superlatives to describe her performance here.  Her scenes with Fierstein are electric in their intensity.  You forget you're watching 2 performers at the top of their powers, and all of a sudden you feel like you're eavesdropping on some very personal conversations between two very real people.
Issues that are very real to gay people:  family acceptance(or lack thereof), death of a partner, infedility, anonymous sex, (gay)-bashing, partners who can't or won't commit are explored and very poignantly too.  It should be pointed out that this story takes place in the pre-AIDS 1970's, so that issue isn't dealt with.  The rest of it works so beautifully, and not a false note is struck from start to finish.  Well worth the price of a purchase or rental.",1008460800,4,1517,4.9760956175298805
515761,5,6302800587,This film gave me insight into the heart of the character's relationship.  It was loving and moving. I adore it.,1003536000,2,112,4.6
515762,3,6302800587,"Harvey Fierstein was once a playwright of strength and wit, and a comedian of skill.  His screenplay ""Tidy Endings"", based on a one-act stage play and filmed with himself and Stockard Channing, was one of the first notable pieces to capture the human side of the AIDS epidemic;  his book for the stage musical version of ""La Cage Aux Folles"" was widely held to be the best thing about the show (except, perhaps, the anthemic showstopper ""I Am What I Am"", for years the mainstay of many a drag show and now reborn as a women's cosmetics commercial).  He appears to have settled these days for being solely an actor, but sadly he only seems to have scored work in a string of grotesque campy caricatures -- most people would only know him as the makeup-artist brother in ""Mrs Doubtfire"", or (worse!!) as Jeff Goldblum's drama-queen assistant in ""Independence Day"".  I'm sure that's more a comment on Hollywood's insecurity with gays than on Harvey's abilities or sentiments, but this is a man who was once a virtual poster-boy for gay liberation.
He had a golden moment in 1983, when his three interconnected burlesques on gay life and relationships, collectively known as ""Torch Song Trilogy"", won him two Tony Awards on Broadway:  one for his script, and the other for his performance in the leading role.  Five years later he managed to bring the Trilogy to the screen, though at the time gay life was a subject that closed doors and left many phone calls unanswered.  Kudos to Harvey for getting this made, but the end result looks like it's jumped, staggered and dragged itself through quite a number of hoops in the process of getting studio release.
For the film version, Harvey rewrote, toned down and gutted his own four hours' worth of script into a distilled hour and a half of screenplay.  Clearly, it's possible to cover many more ideas and tones in a trilogy of plays than in a single screenplay that must appeal to at least a segment of a mass market to be successful (or even accepted);  to some degree, Harvey had to make the screenplay ""safer"".  Sadly, perhaps inevitably, what gets lost in the process of translation is much of the humanity of the original;  here, we're left with a barrage of witty, self-bitchy, one-liners and an over-compressed plot.  Because a lot of the little moments are gone -- moments that made Arnold (Fierstein) so adorable in the stage script, and made much of his own particular take on life seem to be so sane -- many of the reasons for characters' attitudes and choices in the film version aren't as clear as they need to be.  Some of the cut scenes (such as the hilarious depiction of anonymous sex in the back room of a gay bar) were trimmed by Fierstein himself as a responsible act in the face of the growing AIDS threat (refreshingly, in this film AIDS is not a defining feature of gay culture);  other moments in the original script, I suspect, were sacrificed to appease nervous studio executives.
What survives, if not classic comedy, is at least well worth seeing.  Fierstein's performance is masterful, very funny, and at times quite moving;  Matthew Broderick gives a brave, honest and very likeable performance;  and Anne Bancroft is, for once, well-cast in a role that's large enough to prevent even her from chewing it up and spitting it out.
The other two principles are more of a problem.  Brian Kerwin, playing Arnold's on-off bisexual-or-maybe-not lover, is pale and uncertain, rather like his character Ed (though perhaps the fault is actually Fierstein's -- I'm not sure that in fact Harvey even likes this character in his writing);  and Eddie Castrodad, as Arnold's adopted son David in the third act, is just too self-consciously precocious to raise the emotional response the script needs and is striving for.
As a record of Harvey Fierstein's Tony-winning performance, this is sadly a pale ghost;  something has been lost in the translation.  Perhaps this work's most lasting value now lies in being a moment of gay social history.
But for those whose hearts aren't closed to gay men, ""Torch Song Trilogy"" is worth seeing as sheer entertainment as well, and it may even draw an emotional tear to mingle with the tears of laughter.",979430400,12,4204,4.771034482758621

I am not a drag queen, but many of the  conversations Arnold has with his mother I have had with mine. We love each  other, but it's often difficult. I think this is one of those movies that  can help people understand. It is a gay movie, but by the end the only  thing you understand is that they are all human and the sexuality issue  becomes unimportant.
