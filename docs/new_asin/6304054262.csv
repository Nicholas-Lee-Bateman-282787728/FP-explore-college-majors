770820,4,6304054262,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film, its production, wit, style or performance. On the other hand, it makes about as much sense as The 39 Steps, which isn't much. The Hitchcock project has more polish. Edmund Lowe in the male lead is fine and Constance Cummings does good work as well. They do not however connect as Donat and Carroll do. For films buffs, a must see. All others, mood dependent.",1356480000,,408,4.602739726027397

This shockingly little known and unfairly neglected British film from the same screenwriters as Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes offers just as much fun as the aforementioned. Finding a little gem like this one is why film buffs keep looking through rare video catalogs and scouring secondhand stores; for that golden moment you discover a gemstone of such exceptional quality it makes it worth the effort. Seven Sinners is such a film.

Edmund Lowe and Constance Cummings are delightful fun as a Pinkerton detective on holiday and a lovely insurance investigator who find themselves caught up with international saboteurs at Carnival in Nice. Harwood (Lowe) is having great fun on vacation when he discovers a dead man in the hotel room next to his. Beautiful insurance gal Caryl Fenton (Cummings) hooks up with the partying detective around this time on another matter which takes a back seat when Harwood can't get anyone to believe him when the body in question disappears!

There is some sparkling banter and wit exchanged between Harwood and the lovely Caryl as he attempts to discover who the man was. When the Paris Express is wrecked, taking dozens of lives, the fun takes a serious turn. Harwood discovers the man's body in the wreckage, suspecting all this was done to cover up one murder. The couple must use clues in a picture to track those from an organization known as The Pilgrims of Peace and soon the hunters become the hunted.

Lowe is excellent and Constance Cummings fabulous as they race along after clues and sparks fly between them. It has a charming feel found in many of Hitchcock's best during his British period. Albert De Courville's direction juggles romance and danger perfectly while the photography of M. Greenbrum gives the film a touch of class. This is a region 2 DVD so a region-free player is required if not in that region. It is available in NTSC format vhs, however. Do not be confused by the titles in parenthesis; Doomed Cargo and The Wrecker are alternate titles used for this little gem. There is a marvelous ending which every film lover will adore, making this a real favorite. A terrific find!",1270252800,10,2195,4.86096256684492

771214,5,6304054262,"Nice British film from the '30's. Constance Cummings started on Broadway and then went to Hollywood, but married Benn Levy, a political active British writer-director, and moved to Britain where she worked both on stage and in British cinema. Her timing and delivery are marvelous and Edmund Lowe works wonderfully with her. The off-screen lives of both leads are not dull.

I am a docent at a train museum, so the three trains wrecks were very well done for the special effects of the time. For a comedy/mystery, they handled the after effects of the first crash very well. I appreciate that if you are paying attention, they play fair with the audience and you will know who the most infamous of the guilty parties is before the detectives realize it. Such a small detail.",1410566400,2,774,4.733333333333333

7860482,4,6304054262,"An obscure movie but I found it to be very enjoyable. Feels a little like an early Hitchcock movie; mystery, suspense and humor. I originally saw it on Youtube and then I wanted my own copy so I purchased this DVD.  I was very satisfied with the quality of this particular DVD. Many times older movies, particularly in the public domain, are virtually unwatchable, however this DVD was quite good quality. I'm referring to the version pictured with a red and yellow cover, there is no branding on the product.  If you enjoyed the The 39 Steps, or the Lady Vanishes get this movie, I don't think you will be sorry.",1492387200,,613,4.513513513513513
7860483,4,6304054262,"Don't get this one confused with the 1940 melodrama of the same title that starred John Wayne and Marlene Dietrich. Or, to circumvent such commotion, maybe we should refer to it by its alternate title: Doomed Cargo. It's a lighthearted 1936 British thriller that borrows some from Hitchcock and the Thin Man. I think it's worth a watch. It's not that long.

""The most difficult type of criminal to find is a madman without a motive,"" somberly remarks French policeman Paul Turb (played by French actor Thomy Bourdelle in his first English-speaking role). He directs this observation to Edward Harwood who may or may not be recovering still from a wicked hangover. Harwood (Edmund Lowe), European representative of a New York-based detective firm, had just survived a train crash, and excuse him but right now he's a bit suspicious. It's to do with a raucous carnival in Nice and Harwood, three sheets to the wind, stumbling upon a corpse that promptly vanishes. Later, in the wreckage of the Paris Express, what are the odds of Harwood's running into that same corpse? So, yeah, he smells something fishy, strongly enough that he wagers Inspector Turb $5000 that he'll be the first to collar the train saboteur.

But that's him getting sidetracked form his original assignment which is to recover a Scottish lady's missing jewelry. He was supposed to be on that job, working with an insurance agent for the World Wide Insurance Company, also New York-based. As it were, he and the insurance agent, Caryl Fenton (Constance Cummings), end up scampering from Nice to Paris to England's West Country and London, distracted by the missing stiff and a series of deliberate train wrecks.

Maybe I hold it against Edmund Lowe that, with his reedy voice, he sounds like William Daniels, not exactly the vocal epitome of hard-boiled gumshoeing. Lowe is rarely serious in his roles. He often cracks wise. I consider him a poor man's Wiliam Powell. He's not bad as the carefree, intrepid shamus in this one. But it is what it is. Constance Cummings, lovely thing, is always terrific. She and Lowe make a serviceable couple. Oh, they try their durndest to muster up the chemistry of, say, a Loy & Powell, but hardly anyone can do that. It doesn't help that their banter doesn't sparkle quite. Here's a taste:

- Harwood: ""Hence, I'll have to bust into that gent's flat.""
- Caryl Fenton: ""Hence, you'll bust into it alone.""
- Harwood: ""Of course, it's a man's job.""
- Caryl: ""Oh, is it? I'll go find one.""
- Harwood: ""I knew I could count on you.""

Doomed Cargo is based on the 1924 play, The Wrecker, by Bernard Merivale and Arnold Ridley, and this matters inasmuch as that Ridley's granddaughter happens to be in some recent Star Wars motion picture. A bit of trivia: The play was first adapted to cinema in 1928 as a silent picture. Note that the silent had a spectacular scene in which a locomotive collided with a lorry left on the tracks. This scene was shot in only one take but was recorded with 22 cameras. Some of the shots that weren't used for the silent were then used for the 1936 version.

3.5 out of 5 stars. My guess is that, around this period, a ton of British thrillers were patterned after Hitchcock's thrillers. So it goes for Doomed Cargo. The vanishing corpse. The ""witty"" repartee. The having to get out of a scrape whilst in a public venue. The film treats us to all of the above, but also piles on with an amusing sequence that champions an odd way to hold a cigar and the incomprehensibility of the game of whist. I do like this movie. I like the genre. This one's got Constance Cummings, and I love how playful she is. It features a deviously hidden villain and several exciting action beats (that train crash!). And, to cap it all off, there's even a neat resolution to their original case of the missing jewelry. How's that for catching all the dangling threads?",1485820800,,3879,4.680351906158358
