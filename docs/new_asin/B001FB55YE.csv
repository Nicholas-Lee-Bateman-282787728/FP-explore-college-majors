3567895,5,B001FB55YE,"I can't begin to understand the criticism this film has received.  If you liked Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll like this one.  Saw it in the theater and IMMEDIATELY came home and put it on order with Amazon.",1232755200,9,230,4.4523809523809526
3567896,4,B001FB55YE,"This is Guy Ritchie film all the way; love him or hate him I would assume one would be reading about this film with the intention of seeing it anyway. Hence, let's see what Guy can do with finally getting a BD release.

The story would appear to take large paragraphs of text describing complicated story lines, intertwining coincidences, and lots of fancy camera work. He needs very believable performances to carry out this crime caper, and I think he got them, from virtually everyone. Tom Wilkinson always delivers, Gerard, Thandie and even Ludacris get the job done, but I have to give the performance that makes the film watchable is Strong's. A great actor that filled the need to be the right-hand man with grace and strength.

The BD, unfortunately, preserves a film that contains hundreds, if not thousands of muted colors and landscapes. The interiors are frequently spattered with infrequent lighting, the exteriors with overcast weather, and any color saturation being blotted out with a strange and bland lens. The two docus are 15 and 8 minutes long covering a decent background on the production, especially the location info. The 2 minute deleted scene was thankfully cut, and the commentary is best summarized by Ritchie saying they are going to ""waffle"" through the entire film.

Not particularly the best test for your display and sound system, and not a movie for those that have (as a prominent reviewer here at Amazon would say) a SASS. A film you have to pay attention to, preserved decently on a BD containing a commentary about how happy the director is with his work (and himself).",1232668800,,1608,4.861313868613139
3567897,1,B001FB55YE,"This film had great potential (in terms of casting) but was *seriously overstretched* (in terms of plot).

1. The movie was really convoluted. (I can't go into the reasons for this here, since it would take too much space to synopsize the plot.)

2. The number of coincidences that went into making this plot were just waaaaayyy too many to be believed. It is nice when a *few* incidents come together to make a storyline, but this was just over the top.

3. Guy Ritchie did do good work with ""Snatch."" What the hell happened here? Ego? Sloppiness? Time constraints?

4. The acting was good, as was the casting. There were even a few witty lines.  It's just that even those were not enough to save the greviously stretched plot.

5. Save your money. This is not even worth a single matinee movie ticket-- or even an overnight rental fee. When this movie comes out in the USA, it will probably be on public television in, say, a week.",1232582400,12,933,4.491124260355029

3567900,5,B001FB55YE,"Guy Richie has turned out the gem of his career with RockNrolla.  Perfect cast (Wilkenson should get an award for this one) incredible sound track, and a wild and wicked plot.  Unlike some of his others, this one makes it a bit easier to understand the dialects. It was the delight of my movie going month in October when it came out here in the U.S.

  From reading some of the reviews that pan this movie, it is obvious that they are not familiar with Guy Richie's films, his style and his offbeat humor.  It is sort of like licorice; Some people love it some people hate it.  But for those of us who have the right mindset for Richie's style of film, this it the best one to come along in a long time.

  Gerard Butler's turn in this is hysterically funny and is such a great switch from his role in 300.  No type casting trap for Gerry.  This guy can play the heck out of any role imaginable.  But if the Wild Bunch shows up again in the next Richie film, I hope Gerry is included.

3567901,1,B001FB55YE,"Instead of showing us who the characters are and what they are like, Ritchie insists on telling us--via voiceover narration for the first 20 minutes of the movie--which winds us being a complete bore.  Not only that, it was one of the most confusing movies I have seen in a while.  I was never really sure who was doing what and why.  I mean, why were the Russians after Gerard Butler?  Why was everyone after the painting?  Let me just say, Ritchie is no Quentin Tarantino.",1229212800,9,474,4.465116279069767

3568069,3,B001FB55YE,"""Rocknrolla"" was a solidly good movie and quietly could be Guy Ritchie's best movie. It had a nice subtle sophistication to it, and it lacked the shocking, stomach-turning violence of ""Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" It allowed you to concentrate on the plot developments, acting, and characters, all of which were good.

What was missing from this movie that the first two movies in his gangster-tough guy trilogy had was that brawling confidence. It was sort of missing that creativity and freshness of the first two movies in the realm of graphics and editing. There was something exciting, creative, and adrenaline-pumping about the first two movies, but somehow, this movie slowed down, hit its stride, and was probably better in the fundamentals. Again, it helped a lot that it didn't have any sickening and sociopathic violence in it. That allowed you to kick back and enjoy the show without it making you feel too uneasy. The music was fun and spot-on in many places, although it was a little too prosaic in other places. In an odd way, this movie feels a little bit over the hill and nursing-homey in places, but that doesn't stop this from being an excellent movie. It has the familiar stew of Russian gangsters who are indestructible, Rasputin-style, along with other Guy Ritchie trademarks. I can't decide if I'm tired of these elements, or if it's totally fine and cool to see them again, and perhaps I'm just over analyzing things. In any event, the acting by Tom Hardy and Jeremy Piven is very good, while the standout of the movie must be Toby Kebbell playing Johnny Quid. He gives an awesomely troubled and sensitive performance as the wayward step-son of the lead gangster played by Tom Wilkinson.

All around, this movie was very good, although somewhat lacking the verve of ""Lock Stock....."" and ""Snatch,"" but far better in other ways. I definitely recommend it, but I'd watch it with the subtitles on if you're American. I give it three to three and a half stars.",1498435200,,2000,4.811046511627907

3568215,5,B001FB55YE,"So thrilled this is finally available with extra features. One of the best of the London gangster genre films to come down the pike. Ritchie is definitely a genius at assembling this kind of explosive ensemble cast, that work so incredibly well together, they've made this the crown jewel of his gangster sagas. Butler, Hardy, Strong, Wilkinson, Newton, and Alba, all class acts in their own right, but combined, they elevate this film to dizzying heights. Some of the best scenes were the comedic bits,  with that classic British sarcasm and colorful insults, and mixed with the clash between Butler and the Russians, opened up a new perspective in culture shock. The only thing that could have made it better, would be to  see Clive Owen in a cameo as the Hit Man from 'I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' and Jason Statham as the getaway driver. Other than that, perfect. Now if they just had given credit on the film to the 2 Songs after closing credits....boys??",1492387200,,957,4.724550898203593

3568248,4,B001FB55YE,"The main issue is that RocknRolla followed Lock, Stock and Snatch, which were excellent! The third time around just gives this less edge and everything is familiar. London gangsters...check. Bumbling petty thieves that you can't help but like...check. Big ensemble cast of extremely talented actors...check. Lots of inter-connected plots...check. Chasing after a mcguffin, this time a painting...check.

New elements include a female presence in the form of Thandie Newton, delving into the drug scene, some homoerotic themes where Tom Hardy gets to shine (scene-stealer that Handsome Bob lol), and the dialects are much easier to understand (no Brad Pitts here thankfully). There are five groups of characters: the old-school gangsters (Wilkinson and Strong), the Wild Bunch (Butler, Elba, Hardy), Johnny Quid and his boys, the Russians, and then the Woman. The movie would have been better with a little more focus on the first three and kept the Russians and Stella in the background. Hell, I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more if it had focused on the Wild Bunch and Quid...they provided much of the action, wit, and banter.

3569236,5,B001FB55YE,"Okay, honestly I really wanted to watch this movie because Tom Hardy is in it (<3 hehe) and I could not resist watching anything he is in. Even so he had a little bit of scenes in the film. FYI this film is directed by Guy Ritchie whom does the Sherlock Films with Robert Downey and Jude Law. (So if you like those, this one is definitely worth checking out) However, watching the rest of the movie and paying attention to the story line and the characters, I found out that this is one of the rare films that has an all star cast, which actually works! All the actors in the film do such a great job of their characters. You feel that ""yeah I could see Gerard Buter being a criminal in London"". The narration during the film makes it easy to understand how the characters all relate to one another. This came out in 2008 and it did not do so well, which I find hard to believe. This movie has everything, it has action, drama, criminals, violence, comedy, and bit of romance. For me any movie that can pull all that off is just a great find! Now awaiting for ""RocknRolla 2"" to come out. Come on Guy Ritchie! ^^",1443571200,11,1111,4.196261682242991

But, this one has elements that are not found in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. What I find interesting is his films have no women, or just one female character...which as a woman I enjoy thoroughly. The cast is excellent, including Tom Hardy who's a huge star now in a small, but very memorable part. Gerard Butler and Idris Elba as partners in crime is fun to watch as they are a bit inept. But, Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of the gangster boss is incredible. And with Mark Strong's narration, it can't miss! See it!!",1439769600,,647,4.445378151260504

This turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while! Great dialoque and wonderfully drawn characters combined with some great scenes made this a fun film to watch. All of the cast members give great performances here. There's alot of British terminalogy used in the dialoque that I didn't quite catch the first time I watched it, but after the second and third viewings I caught on to what was being said. Overall, this is a great movie to watch. It kept me interested. There's alot of humor here, too.",1416441600,,652,4.308943089430894

Okay, so it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it was entertaining. Mark Strong is the real hero of the movie with Gerard Butler, Tom Hardy, and Idris Elba as the entertaining comic relief of the film. In fact, the scenes with Gerard Butler are the funniest of the film--especially the second robbery--you'll see what I mean when you watch it.

The dialog can be a little hard to follow, I think they have ""English"" subtitles for the English, but the plot is solid, the actors are now huge stars. Tom Hardy, Thandy Newton, Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, and the fantastic Tom Wilkenson are supurb.

Here he reclaims the mantle as king of the British gangster film that was established with ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"".  Like in those two films he's juggling multiple story lines and cases of mistaken identity or motive but isn't on par with those films because of occasional lapses in coherence and story lags.

This perfectly paced piece of action adventure stars some great actors, including Tom Wilkinson who delivers an awesome performance. Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director.

3570766,3,B001FB55YE,"After watching and adoring ""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" and ""Snatch"", I had high hopes for this film, especially considering the cast - but I was ultimately a little bit disappointed. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited spoilers.

I will not say much about the story, it is for you to discover, but this is another Guy Ritchie British gangster film, so you can expect to find a mob boss (played here by Tom Wilkinson), a femme fatale (played here by Thandie Newton) and three small time crooks somehow overwhelmed by the stuff they got themselves into (played here by Gerald Butler, Idris Elba and Tom Hardy), as well as some other colorfoul characters.

There is of course some humour, as the director attempted to repeat the success of his earlier British gangster films, but this movie is really significantly less funny than the two previously mentioned masterpieces. Also, some characters are simply impossibly annoying, like the prodigal son of mob boss (and also terminal junkie), named Johny Quid.

There will be of course some dead bodies dropped, some people will get double-crossed, there will be some robberies, some sex, some Russian gangsters, an appearance of the Old Bill, etc. - but somehow all this doesn't work as it should. Also, a part of the plot is in fact simply copy pasted from ""Layer Cake"" - and that really wasn't necessary... Finally, some things are not definitely explained at the end of the film (it concerns mostly Thandie Newton's character), as if it has been poorly edited and some important scenes were removed by mistake. And I absolutely hate when it happens.

So, notwithstanding good actors and some good moments (especially one really hilarious robbery), this film is definitely a lesser thing than previous British gangster movies by Guy Ritchie. Watchable of course, but do not get your hopes too high.",1385078400,,1868,4.939490445859873

3570880,5,B001FB55YE,"I consider this to be Guy Ritchie's best effort so far.  Its a fast paced fun story with a villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever (well played by Tom Wilkinson).  It has the incomparable Mark Strong playing lawful evil, the lovely Gerard Butler as a slightly bumbling but lucky petty thief, and Toby Kebbell as the center of the film.  Exciting interwoven storylines make this a movie that requires attention--and keeps it easily.",1373155200,,449,5.04054054054054

The film is VERY British, with incomprehensible and incomplete plot lines, the acting is at best mediocre and the ""comedy"" relief was not funny.  The best part of the movie was Thandie Newton, cool, calm, collected, but with a VERY minor role.

3570960,5,B001FB55YE,"Right up front I have to tell you I am a British humor fan....Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Little Britain, League of Gentleman and Absolutely Fabulous DVD's, just to name a few, are constantly playing in my workroom most evenings, so I am always on the look out for more of the same.  While ""RocknRolla"" is not cut from the same tartan clothe as the previously mentioned works, much of the humor in this movie has its roots in that same sometimes dry and and always thought provoking British wit.

This movie is littered with a wild cast of characters who all have their own little story going on within the confinds of the movie.....and the wonderful thing about this movie is seeing how Guy Richie weaves and intertwines the individual stories into a complete story that has all of the parts coming together in the end.  This movie has so many levels to the story that the rich texture makes you want to watch over and over because no matter how many times you see it, you always find bits and pieces you missed before.

It, I must tell you, helps if you are familiar with British slang and style to get all of the ""inside"" jokes, but the real pleasure of this movie are the characters. From the no nonsense connected crime boss Lenny, the suave enforcer Archie, the Wild Bunch......Handsome Bob, Mumbles and One Two, to the beautifully smooth and devious accountant, Stella. and the wiser than his years, drugged up real RocknRolla, Johnny Quid, the story takes you on a ruckus and sometimes disturbing ride through London's underbelly.

This movie is not for everyone..........if you don't enjoy the British style humor and you don't want to view this a few times to see all that is going on stay away, but in my opinion, the music, witty dialog and great cast of characters make this a fun ride through the dark side of England, and more directly, London's mob scene.  Just keep an open mind.",1363910400,6,1897,4.597633136094674

3571165,5,B001FB55YE,"But still very much his. Stylish, really, really funny, and well-acted, this is your standard British gangster type movie, where there is an old guy who is trying to screw over the younger generation of criminals, but due to some coincedence and a missing painting, the tables get turned on him.

It didn't have quite as impressive set of plot twists I've come to expect from Ritchie, but he compensates by wonderful characters and lots of very clever dialogue. Gereard Butler, Idris Elba, and Ton Hardy all play believeable but not over-the-top small time criminals. (Idris Elba makes me laugh at every scene he's in.)

Also including Mark Strong as Archie, the second-hand to the old guy boss and middle man between Larry and the other srooks, is eloquent and funny, but also darkly ominous. There's a lot to enjoy in this film. It's pretty easy to watch, and most of the cast is really fun to watch as their stories eventually meet up at the end.",1357948800,,949,4.676646706586826

3571408,4,B001FB55YE,"For 2012, I am doing a 100 hundred movie challenge. After slacking for a few months ( ahem, majority of them ), I realized I was terribly behind and started taking suggestions from friends, family, and anyone who would listen for five minutes. When I read the synopsis, I wasn't sure this was going to be the movie for me. However, I wasn't being picky about what I was watching at this point as I realized I had three three months to watch 75 movies. I would take what I could get, especially at a decent price.

First and foremost, I was pleasantly surprised! The plot, though a bit twisty in the beginning, was pretty easy to follow. While violence was present, it was not over the top and particularly gory. It fit perfectly with the story and did not seem to be completely unnecessary. The humor was on pitch and struck just the right tone of funny but not campy. Nothing between characters felt forced ( thanks to a fantastic cast ) and you really got the sense that they were some old pals just hanging around.

In all, this movie was a great sort of watch for a fun movie night with the gang. Guys, gals, anybody could enjoy this film.",1347235200,,1143,4.36150234741784

It is defintely not for everyone's taste, but this should definitely please those who enjoyed Guy Ritchie's earlier Snatch and Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels. There are a number of seemingly unrelated plots, but they do finally come together. There is surprisingly little on-screen violence (the effective editng makes it seem like there is much more than we actually see). The accents may take a bit of getting used to, but Ritchie's dialogue has a wonderful feel, both humorous and menacing, for London's gangster underworld. The standout in the cast is Tom Wilkinson, who is superb, although that seem like a redundant statement - has Tom Wilkinson ever given anything less than a superb performance?",1346976000,,743,5.2

Rock'N Rolla was the first Guy Ritchie film I'd seen since the Sherlock movies, and I was taken to a happy place. It reminded me a lot of ""Snatch"", and some about ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"".

3571470,5,B001FB55YE,"I am not someone who likes to glorify violence or criminals but this film was so much fun. From the beginning to the end this film goes in full throttle with fun and excitement and even laughs. Basically this is a typical British comedy of errors but instead of stuffy old ladies and pish-posh gentlemen it is criminal gangs, mobsters and international terrorists!

To give a bit of a plot description would actually be too cumbersome here but basically the theme and plots revolves around which bad guy is fooling whom. It is multi-layered and complicated at times and you need to pay attention or you will get lost quickly. The ensemble cast is terrific and even the ""ugly"" people are full of charisma. I also have to say even though they don't get top billing Mark Strong and especially Thandie Newton nearly steal the show. There is a scene where Thandie is dancing and lets just say she has got some ""good"" moves. It is also one of the most fun scenes in the film.

This film is not going to be on any critics lists of best films BUT it is definitely in my top twenty favourite films of all time.

UPDATE:

I wanted to give a quick update on this film. I have recently ordered the Blu-ray version and I was very surprised to see the difference between the two. The DVD had a beautiful picture but this was even better. It was so clear it was almost uncomfortable seeing the detail in people's faces like skin pours and facial hair. Anyway, worth the extra few bob for sure BUT the DVD is just fine. I don't think you lose anything with the DVD you just gain a wee bit with the Blu-ray.",1326931200,4,1590,4.361486486486487

3571566,5,B001FB55YE,"Wow, I loved this movie!  Just watched it and I want to watch it again.

RockNRolla is about two guys trying to get a loan to buy a building.  Simple enough right?  Problem is they have past criminal records and that forces them to seek funding from somewhere other than the bank.  When ""planning"" falls through for their acquisition, they end up in debt and must pay within a month or face all sorts of problems.

I've enjoyed other Guy Richie movies, most recently Sherlock Holmes, but I have never actually sought out his films.  Truthfully, I don't really remember much about Lock, Stock and Two Smokin Barrels except that they were up to no good and... well, that's about it.  But I do remember Revolver.  Did anyone see that film starring Jason Statham, Andre 3000, Ray Liota and that big Italian guy?  Maybe I'll review that too....

Guy Richie has an obvious style, and it really does work, at least for me.  The way he frames people, the snappy dialogue and even the narration - some people don't like narration, but I happen to enjoy it. In fact, in a movie like Like Water for Chocolate, I really would have appreciated some narration. Loved the book, but had I not read it prior to seeing the film I would have been totally lost.  But I'm off topic...

On top of his stylized way of shooting, he does some great casting. I think Rock N Rolla came out after Smokin Aces (it was sooo not as good and stupidly, that's the one I saw), and I think I kind of lumped the two films together in my mind skipping this much better film. Want to know what brought me back?

FAN GIRL ALERT!!!!!

Gerard Butler baby!!  Do you know how unbelievable it is to me that I have been sleeping on the goodness that is Gerard?  The first movie I saw starring him was The Ugly Truth (loved it - All haters of the Heiglmeister zip it. I've loved her since My Father the Hero).  So since I loved that movie and 300 had been sitting in my shelf for close to a year, I figured I should find out what all the hype was about (apparently 300 is enjoyed by women as much or even more than men...) and Gerard did not disappoint!!!  Yeah, then I looked him up on Netflix to see what other films he's been in and man! He's all over the place!!!  Did you know he starred in the Phantom of the Opera movie? As the Phantom?  Singing?!?  Well anyway, RockNRolla popped up and I decided this was going to be my next Gerard Butler film.  Idris Elba also starred and well, he's quite easy on the eyes as well.

Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest back to the movie.  Mr. Ritchie loves colorful dialogue and I have to say, those accents, while not nearly as posh as those found in Austen films, are still quite fetching when uttered from the lips of (you guessed it) Gerard Butler.  Ludacris and Jeremy Piven, shut the hell up, you're messin up my movie.  But in all seriousness, the writing was fun and real, though sometimes it got a little to ""deep"" for my semi-shallow mind (I don't know what Johnny Quid was talking about at the piano) but that didn't stop my enjoyment of the film.  In terms of action, there really wasn't much, except for the big scene with the Russians  ( a laugh-out-loud moment).  RockNRolla is more of an ""Oh the terrible webs we weave when we practice to deceive..."" type of movie.  I think GuyRitchie had lots of fun piecing together these characters and their respective stories.

My two favorite scenes are (And I'm sorry for making this an ""I love Gerard"" fest, but he was awesome in this film) Gerard and his scenes with Handsome Bob as well as the ""Russians"". Priceless.  Props to Mark Strong (also played the main baddie in Sherlock Holmes), as the connecting thread to all these groups throughout the movie.",1297036800,,3720,4.382481751824818

3571570,3,B001FB55YE,"Not bad when taken as a single independent movie, but when viewed as a Guy Ritchie movie some disappointment definitely surfaces.

It follows that classic Guy Ritchie model, where a bunch of charachters get intertwined and the plot continues to thicken throughout the entire movie and is abruptly resolved at the end.

Pros:
The Characters in the moive have that unique English freshness to them as opposed to American gangster movies and Guy has not carried much from previous characters in similar moives like Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. Instead the charaters have their own uniqueness and depth.

Personally I liked the slight political incorrectness in the movie. The character Lenny kept voicing his frustration with the imigrants in the country quite boldly! (not necessairly a bad or good thing... but these things are real)

Also, I liked the sleek character of Archie! His cool, calm, and collected demeanor in addition to his sharp look added to the character's appeal! However, you do get the feeling that he does get frustrated with dealing with Lenny's ego issues, and maybe even thinks he could easily be as good, if not better than Lenny. Your typical young gangster, who's works for the top dog!

Mr. Johnny Quid!!! His character just annoyed me!!! Not in a bad way where I hated him for it, but in a way that he was supposed to be annoying as a crackhead!!! But the more the movie goes on the more you realize he's not just some stoner junkie!!!

The soundtrack was good but not great! The soundtracks used in the other two Guy moives were much better!

I liked the action scene with the Russians and the part where the Russians were about to dice up old One Two and Archie walks in!! But the action scenes in the movie leave a bit to be desired!

I loved the crayfish torture!!! (and the crack about the Americans and American crayfish!) A bit of a twist on Bricktop's feeding people to pigs (from Snatch)!

The twist at the end was really unforeseen!!! I didn't see that coming!

Cons:
The main thing is that this movie uses the same model as the other more poopular Guy Ritchie movies like Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.... but sadly not close to being as good!!! I was hoping to see something of the same calibre but I was slightly disappointed with this one!

The character of Lenny.... O.K, I'll admit he is a bit different than the previous bad guys in Guy's other movies but compared to Bricktop (from Snatch), he's a rich puff with too much ego!!! Frankly not as interesting a character!!!

Also, the use of Russians in both this movie and Snatch... come on... be a bit creative! Plus the Russian goons in this movie are not even close to being as interesting as 'Boris the Blade' from Snatch!

What about, Vinny, Solomon, Bullet-tooth Tony, Avi, Tyrone, and the rest of the lot from Snatch?? The depth in these characters is not there in this movie, you don't really feel close to these characters... very shallow character depth.. you don't connect to them!

All in all, not a bad movie... wouldn't mind seeing it again but not as many times as I have seen Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels! The more you watch the other two and then watch this one the more your disappointment will grow! I really think Mr. Guy Ritchie peaked with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch!",1287014400,,3361,4.636363636363637

  The film has a great cast and a kick ass score. The music almost steals the show it's so good. However, Toby Kebbell as a junkie is the actor that steals the show. Everyone is good, but it's Kebbell who's performance was Oscar worthy.

  I should also mention that I think Gerald Butler also does his best work. The way he reacts when one of his friends in his gang confesses to wanting him, is hilarious. While his dance scene with Thandie Newton is about as strange and fun as John Travolta's with Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.

  Speaking of Newton she's her sexiest here as Butler's boss who sends him on life threating errands that she sees as easy jobs.  While Tom Wilkinson gives one of his best performances as a scummy mob boss. No one plays that part better than Wilkinson I think. He was awesome in Batman Begins and is just as good here.

3571643,5,B001FB55YE,"I liked Lock, Stock and Snatch, but I loved RocknRolla.  It was stylish, clever, and extremely funny.  In many ways, it was a typical gangster movie, with a few thefts, a few shoot outs, and a few double crosses. However, it was the relationships between the characters, as well as the unexpected surprises, that made the story.  For example, when Archie, (Mark Strong)the top enforcer for criminal boss Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), was instructing his underlings in the art of the backhanded slap, he advised them that if they could perfect the slap, ""strong violence"" wasn't necessary; but if their target didn't talk after being slapped, they could cut him or pay him, ""but keep the reciepts because this isn't the mafia.""  And speaking of the mafia, remember how the gang reacted when they found out that Tony Soprano was getting therapy for anxiety attacks and how they reacted when they found out one of the family was gay?  Well, suffice it to say, these British gangsters are infinitely more sophisticated and much funnier.  The psychoanalytic ramblings of Cole's estranged stepson, Johnny Quidd (Toby Kebel) were hysterical, as were the reactions of various gangsters to the homosexuality of a gang member.  However, there were many parts of this movie that were just laugh out loud funny -- in part because the moments were so unexpected.  There are two particularly funny scenes toward the end:  (1) a chase scene that ends due to a very unexpected twist that leaves Mr. One-Two (Gerard Butler), the small time gangster being chased, laughing at his good fortune; and (2) a scene where Archie goes to round up One-Two and finds him in such a ludicrously compromised position that he ends up laughing.

The cast was really excellent. I particularly enjoyed Tom Wilkinson, Mark Strong, Gerard Butler, and Toby Kebel.  Although I really love Jeremy Piven, and he's good here, because the other characters were so well developed and so well portroyed, Piven's character simply faded into the background.

The plot had some twists, but the unexpected developments really made the movie.  Some of the reviews here complained that the movie was hard to follow, but I didn't think so.  However, I would not recommend trying to watch this movie while doing laundry or paying bills.  The action is rapid fire and there are a lot of characters, os you will miss too much if you are distracted.

The end of the movie leaves some questions unanswered and promises a sequel. I hope Guy Ritchie delivers because a sequel because I would dearly love to know how Archie got the painting and why it is he comes to be where he is at the end.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with his work, I would describe Ritchie as the Quentin Tarantino of the U.K. Ritchie's films usually revolve around organized crime, but they are done in a slightly satirical way. RNR bares some similarities to Pulp Fiction in that there are several branching storylines that eventually intertwine all of the major characters.

Simply put, ""Rock N Rolla"" is a sharply directed and sharply executed mess.

Well acted and full of strong character portrayals-the problem with ""Rolla"" really comes down to plot.  Crucial plot points zip by with lightening speed with very little time for the viewer to really digest or process before being assaulted with another lightening round of additional plot points.  I'm well aware that this is all part of Guy Ritchie's style, but it seems a bit too manic here even for a Ritchie film.  And the film continues to barrel along in this fashion throughout its entire duration-never really letting the viewer catch his or her breath until finally a person just has to ask themselves, ""huh?""

One of the major problems for me with this film was that every character (each coming from very different factions) seemed to be involved in every other character's business in some way and after a while, it became really frustrating to try and grasp who was working for whom and who was playing whom.  Quite frankly-after a while I just really didn't even care any more.  And in the end, when it all came down to it-the movie just seemed completely pointless anyway.  It's too bad the actors involved in this film (an impressive bunch of performances mind you) wouldn't have had a stronger, more ""sensical"" plot to work with.  It truly is a waste.

The first thing to notice about this movie is the fast crisp style of editing with cut-away scenes that jump around to various story lines. The overall color tones of the photography were kinda like a colorized black and white movie. I think they were going for an old ""mobster"" (gang) look and feeling. The next thing is too many characters that are not well defined. I was constantly trying to remember who I was seeing and what they have to do with the story. The background was pulsating and quick paced to match the editing style of the movie. So, I just finished watching the whole movie and yet I'm not sure that I can write a summary other than: Russian mafia meets up with London's biggest crime boss. It is a long movie at 1h54m and felt long as I was constantly lost. This one needs a couple of watchings to get it sorted out.

3571696,4,B001FB55YE,"""RocknRolla"" is a British crime drama directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels). The film is a about a British crime boss named Lenny Cole (Wilkinson) who is involved in the real estate market. When a wealthy Russian real estate tycoon, and crime figure, Yuri Omovich (Karel Roden) comes looking for Lenny to help in a major new deal things start to unravel.

Yuri asks his accountant, Stella (Thandie Newton), to transfer some money to Lenny. Unbeknown to Yuri, Stella mentions the drop off point for the money to a band of thieves, consisting of One Two, and Mumbles (Gerard Butler and Idris). They intercept and steal the money. Also, Yuri has lent his good luck painting to Lenny, but then someone else steals the picture, which Yuri then asks to have returned since he feels his luck has changed since lending it to Lenny. Yuri gets another 7,000,000 for Lenny, but then that too is stolen.

In this world of crime there are the scavengers that take and pillage whatever they can at whatever opportunity becomes available. And through a series of unforeseen events these crime bigwigs start to belief that the other is screwing with them. Lenny thinks Yuri is balking at paying the agreed sum of money, and Yuri, after asking for his lucky painting back and getting excuses from Lenny about why he hasn't returned it, believes Lenny is also screwing with him. All the while behind the scenes there are these weasels, and riff-raff who are screwing with them. In a continually amusing series of mishaps and events the sordid underbelly of the real estate world is turned upside down. This film isn't as brisk as ""Lock, Stock and Two barrels"", but it is highly entertaining nonetheless.",1256256000,,1710,4.793220338983051

There are no dragging scenes, its all constant, fast paced as you follow two different plots in story simultaneously that meet up at the end, which is kind of a who done it.

For some reason when Guy Richie comes out with a new movie I always think its going to stink.  Every time I am amazed at how good it is.  Guy Richie in my eyes is the next Tarantino, I think even better.  He is creating the standard for the ""New Age Gangster Film"".

But what is gangster to do, when immigrant gangsters from Eastern Europe start invading their domestic teritory?  How can he protect his turf and still stay on top of the game.

Amazing cast of characters are connected to each other.  While they all work on the same goal, ultimately they are all looking out for themselves even if it means taking down their partners in crime.

3571707,5,B001FB55YE,If you like Guy Ritchie as a director than you will like this movie! This is realy one of his typical movies with lots of action in it and plenty of violence and nonsense as well.,1246492800,,179,4.0
3571708,3,B001FB55YE,"An interesting cast was assembled to tackle a twist-filled script, directed by a craftsman experience in the genre of everyday mobsters in modern day London.  Every editing trick in the book was used.  Clever camera work was deployed.  A pulsing soundtrack provided a burst of extra energy.  Yet in the end, ROCK N ROLLA is a whole lot of elements that look like they should be something resulting in a movie that is less than the sum of those parts.

Guy Ritchie doesn't really seem capable of directing a thoroughly engaging, focused film anymore.  ROCK N ROLLA has a fairly complex plot, full of deceptions and back-stabbing...yet we follow it easily due to constant narration.  I don't mind narration...but what it does for this film is take the place of tight filmmaking.  We're too often being TOLD what's happening and what it means rather than experiencing and learning for ourselves.  It feels like Ritchie is just repeating himself here, copying ideas that have worked for him before, and throwing them into a blender with some narration.

I won't attempt to rehash much of the plot here, but much of it revolves around London mobster Tom Wilkinson trying to work with incoming Russian mobster Karel Roden.  Roden wants to pay Wilkinson the agree-upon sum of $7 million to smooth the way for building permits...but the money keeps getting stolen.  The actual thefts are executed by some lower level thugs (Gerard Butler & Idris Elba), but are planned by Roden's deceitful accountant (Thandie Newton).  In addition, Wilkinson's got a rock-star stepson named Johnny Quid, who has stolen a valuable painting that needs to be returned by Wilkinson to Roden.  And so on.  Mark Strong plays Archie, Wilkinson's right-hand man and our narrator.  Strong's narration attempts to tie everything together for us, but as I said, being led by the hand SO much takes away some of the joy of discovery.

There are actually several enjoyable performances in this film.  It's nice to see Wilkinson as a Brit, and he tears into his role with great gusto.  He shows the much younger cast members a thing or two about commanding a scene.  I enjoyed Strong as well...he's a very interesting looking actor, and he gives a very tight, contained performance, which serves as a good contrast to all the blustery work everyone else is doing.  Gerard Butler and Idris Elba are very amiable indeed, but aren't given a lot to do. I can see these two starring in a movie together and making a nice impact on an audience.  This is NOT the film for that...and if you're watching it to see Butler, who is so heavily featured on the DVD box and in the trailers...be aware that his part is not all that big.

On the other hand, Thandie Newton once again manages to be supremely annoying.  While not quite reaching the depths of  her performance in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II...she just doesn't carry any heft or credibility.  She's supposed to be a cool customer who likes danger and living on the edge...but she mostly just gets the cool part down.  Standing around in tight dresses and smoking a cigarette does not a convincing performance make!  Also poorly used are Jeremy Piven and Chris Bridges as a couple of American club owners/managers who get sucked into all the mess.  A couple of tweaks to the script, and these characters could have been dropped altogether...so their presence here feels like little more than a ploy to give these two actors the ""cred"" of working with Guy  Ritchie, and to make the movie more appealing to US audiences (and fans of ENTOURAGE, I guess.)  In the end, the two men leave no impression.

The best scene in the movie is a prolonged chase scene, in which Butler and his buddies steal the money from a couple of VERY tough and determined Russian thugs who simply won't be stopped.  It's funny to see the footchase, as Butler and his pursuer get more and more tired.  The scene combined humor and action in a fun way that most of the rest of the movie lacked.  Interesting, all killings happen either offscreen or at least, outside of the shot.  Thus, it's a very violent movie that shows little violence.  There's very little sex...so the R-rating comes from the constant bad language.  And while the movie does have some verbal wit...it is far less clever than it thinks it is.

I've used this clich&eacute; before...but it REALLY holds true here:  ROCK N ROLLA is full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  The movie is really only for die-hard Ritchie fans (are there any?) or Gerard Butler or Tom Wilkinson completists.",1246406400,7,4534,4.75416133162612

The story is entertaining, with an intricate plot, a variety of likeable characters, and a healthy dose of humor amid London's tough criminal underbelly.

The cast is amazing, ranging from Tom Wilkinson as the seemingly all-powerful Lenny Cole, Thandie Newton as the dangerous and sexy accountant Stella (an almost oxymoronic combination that RocknRolla somehow pulls off), Gerard Butler as the almost innocent small time hustler One Two, and a host of other talent including Mark Strong, Jeremy Piven, and Chris (Ludacris) Bridges.

Tom Wilkinson is a classic old-school ""you'll do it cause I say so or you're done"" kind of thug.  But he finds himself up against foreign crime lords who can buy and sell him ten times over and have a corporate mindset on minimizing problems.  Mix into this contest a crew of low-level British good-ole-boys (Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy) with their own agenda and set of complications, messing up the big boys' deal,egged on by a sexy thrill-seeking accountant (Thandie Newton), and disaster for somebody is sure to follow.

This basic story is jazzed up by fancy editing and jazzy music and is just fun to sit back and enjoy.  A particularly long chase sequence is worth the price of admission and a clever sex connection (improvised due to film shooting complications)adds to the irreverent spirit of the thing.

'RocknRolla' tells the story of a Russian businessman who asks a London mobster for help in closing a real estate deal. In between we will see the story of all the characters involved in trying to make the deal happen, those trying to make the deal not to happen, and... you get the idea. While I have to admit I found the movie quite enjoyable and funny, I couldn't help to be reminded of 'Snatch"", there is even a sequence in which Gerard Butler's character, 'One Two' and accomplices try to steal a briefcase with money that reminded me of the bookies sequence in 'Snatch'

The movie takes places in the same universe as'Snatch', so if you liked that movie you will certainly like 'RocknRolla'. This is an elaborated crime story with funny moments and a great soundtrack, a classic Guy Ritchie film.

I turned 17 in 1993 just as Quentin Tarantino was starting out.  When I reached college, Reservoir Dogs was playing late every Saturday night at one of the seediest U-District (that's Seattle) movie theaters.  Then came Pulp Fiction.  Wow.

Rock N Rolla brought back some of that youthful feeling of movie watcing awe.  I'll say that I'd liken Ritchie to the UK version of Tarantino, but still with his own style.

Rock N Rolla, however, did have a good many scenes reminiscent of Pulp Fiction (the Gimp, the Twist contest, some of the strange monologues, the painting = the case with the light in it), but I still felt it was it's own story.

I'm definitely looking forward to the next two installments in this planned trilogy.

3571810,5,B001FB55YE,"This has been another amazing film from Guy Ritchie that never seems to fail, in my eyes at least, with coming up with unforgettable characters and twisting plot lines. One of the great things really stood out to me, other than the brilliant cast, was the way he seamlessly goes through all of plots and subplots about the ever increasing rise to change the way London hasn't been changed for quite a long time.  And not only that, the humor in the movie made it all the better in my eyes. I have been watching his movie ever since Snatch came out on VHS, which no longer works for some reason. Never the less, it was refreshing to see the Wild Bunch as a close group of mates who are all out there to make money and expand, while always looking out for each other. His most previous movie, Layer Cake, was truly a great movie as well, but it really lacked any humor as a driving force, which did wonders for the film. But to get back into the roots of adding just the right amount of hilarious dialogue while also making the story line really progress without getting bogged down with so much detail, you'd need a second viewing to understand what is really going on.  So I must say, if you're a Guy Ritchie fan, pick up this movie to your collection, and with the wonderful lot of actors he has chosen, this will be one movie I hope he makes at least a part two, because the ending does leave the possibility of bringing all the great characters into another movie.

There is no middleground among people when

I enjoyed this movie and all it's rawness, dark humor,
violence and rollercoaster twists and turns!
Gerard Butler, Idris Elba & their motley crew of low dollar
thugs with ambitions for the bigtime made this movie for me!

interesting characters. I also love the cracked-out,
devil-may-care, balls-to-the-wall portrayal of the ROCK-N-ROLLA

3571816,3,B001FB55YE,"Many hail ""Rocknrolla"" as the comeback of Guy Ritchie. It is true that the director of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch,"" impressive one-two punch in 1998 and 2000, feels more comfortable in this UK gangster film territory. He is more assured as director than in dreadful ""Swept Away"" and ""Revolver."" Still, I must add that for all some of its entertaining scenes and largely fine acting, ""Rocknrolla"" doesn&t offer anything new to us.

Perhaps it is pointless to describe the story of Guy Ritchie's latest film ""Rocknrolla."" Conventional storytelling is not Guy Ritchie's forte. But anyway, there is a story and that is about a lucrative London real estate deal and the British/Russian gangsters trying to outwit the others. Enter a femme fatale-like accountant, plus a missing drug-addicted rock star with a subplot about good luck painting. Frankly, I couldn't exactly follow the opening sequence where the major characters are introduced, but anyway I could catch up with it by and by.

For his newest film, Guy Ritchie stopped using his once trademark hyperkinetic direction. It works in several scenes, for example, one ""gentle"" robbery by a small-time criminal ""One Two"" played by Gerald Butler, or the long ""chase"" scene involving his character and the Russian mobsters. Tom Wilkinson (hardly recognizable) is effective as the kingpin Lenny Cole and Mark Strong is fantastic as Archie his faithful right-hand man. In fact, they (and Toby Kebbell as Johnny Quid) are more impressive than Gerald Butler though Butler's acting is very good.

""Rocknrolla"" is Guy Ritchie's return to form, but is still a disappointment to me. It is entertaining and it is great to see the actors having fun making this film. but the film lacks something original.",1237075200,6,1767,5.107266435986159
3571817,3,B001FB55YE,"After getting sick after attending too many touchy-feely Kaballah sessions (force-fed to him by his now ex-wife, Madonna), Guy Ritchie has returned to his roots with another look at the London Underworld in 'Rocknrolla.' I have not seen his two earlier efforts, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch' but having read some of the reviews of this film, I'm told that Rocknrolla is very similar to those prior efforts.

Rocknrolla is not at all like 'The Sopranos' since none of the characters are at all sympathetic. In the Sopranos, the characters are charming but are always in denial about their lack of morality. There is always the strong presence of law enforcement which forces the Sopranos' characters to always look over their shoulders. In Rocknrolla there is no such counterweight. When we do see the police in Rocknrolla we see them only briefly and they're the equivalent of Keystone Cops.

Rocknrolla depicts a contained universe of low-life criminals who take turns at double-crossing one another. Ritchie is not looking to sketch multi-dimensional character portraits as we see in The Sopranos, but rather focus on certain farcical 'types'. Some of the farce is extremely broad--for example two Russian hired assassins who dress up in sado-masochistic outfits and play sado-masochistic games with their tied-up victim but choose not to finish him off right away. The joke is in the way they get sidetracked (that psychopathic killers might also be effeminate) but it's not funny. Similarly, the film's protagonist ""One-Two"" (played by Gerard Butler) is upset with 'Handsome Bob', a member of his gang, when he reveals that he's gay. But instead of beating him up, he calms down, becomes wholly sympathetic and then offers to have sex with him (to show that he is an 'understanding' fellow). In another context (such as Robert DeNiro showing his 'sensitive side' as a mobster spilling his guts out to his shrink in 'Analyze This') the reversal of a 'sensitive' mobster happens to work. But here, the reversal has no panache.

Rocknrolla is very difficult to follow due to the East End accents and an extremely convoluted plot. Tom Wilkinson as Lenny Cole, the real estate crime boss, is probably the most believable of all the criminals depicted in this film (the only scene focusing on Lenny I really had trouble with is when the Russian boss has his henchman cripple Lenny on the golf course; how could Lenny have been lured into a situation where he had no protection?).

Of what I could understand of the plot, One-two (leader of a gang) borrows money from Lenny to buy some property but is unable to pay him back. Meanwhile, the Russian crime boss agrees to pay Lenny 7 million Euros to bribe public officials so that he can build a new sports stadium in London. As collateral, the Russian gives Lenny an expensive painting which is very dear to him which Lenny will hold until the deal is complete (it's hard to understand why the Russian would want to part with the painting as it has so much sentimental value to him). The Russian's accountant (Stella, played by a sexy Thandie Newton) hires One-Two and his gang who steals her boss's 7 million which he is going to pay to Lenny. One-Two then uses some of that money to satisfy his debt to Lenny. Finally, Lenny's rock-star stepson (who reportedly is missing and presumed a suicide) steals the painting and Lenny sends his right-hand man, Archie along with One-Two to find the painting and get it back to him before the Russian blows his stack.

While most of the characters are neither sympathetic, funny or that involving, what I do like about the film is that Ritchie keeps things moving at a frenetic pace with excellent acting, editing and cinematography. By the time the movie is over, you'll be ready to watch it again to figure out exactly what happened. Despite the flawed script, Rocknrolla still has enough interesting things in it to keep your interest. Rocknrolla can best be termed a 'black comedy'. Its main weakness is that it's not all that funny; its strength lies in its light-hearted atmosphere--it doesn't take itself that seriously, despite the deep level of violence that permeates the film.",1236988800,,4197,4.889044943820225
3571818,3,B001FB55YE,"Guy Ritchie's ROCKNROLLA is not as kinetic as his previous SNATCH and is a bit more subdued in comedy, action and violence. This entry into his brand of British ganster film genre is a bit more cerebral and needs a little bit more of a span of attention to follow what's going on. There's stolen money and a missing painting that must be found is the complicated plot in a nutshell. The characters are just as colorful as in his previous outings, but somehow they don't jump out of the screen. Remember Brad Pitt in SNATCH? The versatile Tom Wilkinson (THE FULL MONTY, BATMAN BEGINS) is always great in everything he does and plays a great crime boss in the film. Gerard Butler (300) is pretty good as a member of a band of thieves (called ""The Wild Bunch) roaming London. Some interesting cameos include Jeremy Piven and Chris Bridges (aka rap star Ludacris) as record producers. Also, Thandie Newton plays a cool and beautiful (yet, questionably ethical)accountant of an equally questionable wealthy Russian real estate dealer. Overall, it's worth a look. One must see it a few times to appreciate the atmosphere of the film and to follow the plotline(s) because Guy Richie has a certain style of filmaking that is always interesting and fun. Perhaps his years of marriage to Madonna is to blame for a very slight subdued gangster film.",1236988800,,1338,4.746781115879829

Why - because you just know you're going to spend the next two hours giggling and grimacing (for all the wrong reasons of course) and you're going to be rightly and royally entertained. And bluntly how many British film directors-cum-writers are 'this' good - can entertain you 'this' much? In an industry that seems to have lost the knack of actually turning us on, on the strength of ""RocknRolla"", I for one will be looking out for the Blu Ray box of Guy Ritchie films and not yet another version of Bourne or Aliens (good as they may be).

The story is layered and smart; the dialogue is either crude or ballbreakingly funny - or frequently both - and the casting is varied and immaculate - all of them clearly enjoying themselves. The songs are apt and used sparingly and there's an already classic one-liner that had many of our customers in the shop laugh out loud when we played the CD the other day (dialogue inbetween the music tracks).

The good news for fans is that the BLU RAY version of ""RocknRolla"" is beautifully filmed and I think actually suits Ritchie's film style to a tee - it makes the sharp suits and the London locations shine more. Actor wise - ""RocknRolla"" is crammed full of great cameos and has a lot of classy leading double acts. Tom Wilkinson is the bigwig old-school London criminal Lenny Cole with Mark Strong as Archie his sidekick. Both are typically outstanding. Gerard Butler as One Two and Idris Elba as Mumbles (the drug dealer Stringer Bell in The Wire) play their counterparts - the likely lads who get caught up in deals way over their small-time heads. Jimi Mistry is a corrupt London councillor, Jeremy Piven and Ludacris as producers and nightclub owners who can't control Toby Kebbell as the drugged up rock star Johhny Quid (feigning death to up his sales). The girls are all molls, there's the unkillable Russians, the thieving philosophizing junkies, ticket-touting gangsters covered in Bling living in Range Rovers and yobs who talk about art, culture and the beauty of cigarettes as they whack a difficult bouncer over the head with a bin lid....luverly!

I'll freely admit that as a dabbler in screenplays myself, I sat there with a huge streak of jealousy running through me, because there's truly fantastic writing and skill on show here. One example is the scene where Gerard Butler is sat at a dinner table in a posh London restaurant with the corporate lawyer totty that is Thandie Newton. Butler's character clearly fancies her, but suspects she's just 'too' dangerous and out of his league. Slipping the bulging loot bag he's delivering under the table towards her long and unfeasibly delicious legs, he relays how the swag was attained...with a ""bit of bother"". It then cuts back to the actual robbery - which of course goes horribly wrong - and then just gets progressively worse - not too clever types doing not too clever things. From this hilarious flashback, the movie keeps flicking forward again to their sexually loaded conversation - and back again to more carnage with an escalating pumping soundtrack. It's kind of Ritchie's trademark style, but it's so damn good that you don't even notice how cleverly its been worked out and edited together. It's slick stuff and impressively so.

The movie is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a damn good watch and more importantly - wildly entertaining. And come the sly and clever ending, you're left wanting more - and there's even a hint of a sequel in the closing credits.

In the vernacular - ""RocknRolla"" is a blinding bit of fun and on Blu Ray looks and sounds like the absolute business. Highly recommended and a job well done.",1236902400,21,4038,4.7043847241867045

Gerard Butler as One Two turns in a good performance, not as wild as in ""300"" nor as sweet as ""P.S. I Love You,"" but anchors the film.

Now, Madonna-less, he has returned to his roots for yet another stab at the testosterone driven gangster flick. Unfortunately, as a stab, it is merely a flesh wound.
I don't care what you read in the other reviews, at least give this one some consideration.

""Oh, but there is lots of cursing and some people get shot, it MUST be good.""
Who knows, maybe Ritchie has mellowed with age. Or maybe he just couldn't be bothered. Because, whereas his first movie was tighter than tight, this flick just seemed lazy. Cashing in on a rep while delivering a deeply cut product.
And while we are on the subject of laziness (and crime), maybe Mr. Ritchie doesn't realize how widely viewed and well remembered Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" movie is here in the states or he may not have borrowed so heavily from it. Come on, the central plot device of RockNRolla is a painting that the film never reveals but is so impressive that everybody desires it and mayhem and destruction follows it. Maybe it is a painting of Marcellus Wallace's soul. Just start with that main ""homage"" and look for other plot devices and scenarios that were gently lifted from PF (including a modified ""gimp"" scene). It isn't sampling if the actors have accents.
Right?",1234742400,3,2258,4.762755102040816
3571906,4,B001FB55YE,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Sing a song of crime lords, pockets never dry
2. A Russian dealer comes to town, buildings to buy
3. While the deal was open, there was an offering
4. A rare and lucky canvas, which quickly went missing
5. The Accountant's in her counting house, counting out her money
6. The thug is in the parlor, nibbling at his honey
7. The knave is still a junkie, alive, but no one knows
8. A dirty bunch of con men, and greedy money hos

This is a dark British crime caper with quite a few funny bits, about a London crime boss doing business with a Russian property dealer, a group of criminals known as the Wild Bunch, an overly clever accountant, a harried lawyer, a crack addicted rock star, a couple of record producers, and a couple of junkie thieves.

If you think it sounds confusing, you're right - and things get more complicated when a ""lucky"" painting gets stolen and starts getting passed hand to hand, often under very unlucky circumstances.

Gerard Butler stars as One Two, one of the leaders of the Wild Bunch, and Thandie Newton sizzles as the Accountant.  Other noteworthy performances are provided by Tom Wilkinson as the crime boss, Mark Strong as the right hand man to the crime boss and Toby Kebbell as the drug addicted rock star.  Look also for small parts by Jimi Mistry, Jeremy Piven and Ludacris.

Crime, punishment, betrayal, revenge and greed take center stage in this fast-moving dark comedy/thriller.  Go see this if too much Butler is never enough.

3571908,3,B001FB55YE,"Double crossing abounds in this British tale of underworld backstabbing.  Russians, old Brits, petty thieves, a beautiful accountant, a homosexual gangster, and a crackhead cross paths , steal millions of Euros, beat an old man on a golf course (5-wood in case you were wondering), unearth an informant that led to a ton of jail time, all while watching and expensive painting - a lucky heirloom of sorts - pass hands from one party to the next.  Still with me?

It's essentially a British attempt at the intricacies made famous in the Ocean's Eleven series.  Gerard Butler, Thandie Newton, and a few others are superb, but the film lacks true purpose or plot, and the introduction of countless characters causes a lack of development.

It's not nearly as polished as it should be, and there's nearly no climax or resolution.  Well, I guess there was a resolution of sorts, and kind of a climax, but it's about as tied together as spaghetti.  Lots of promise, and great efforts from Butler and Newton - who is smoking hot in this one - but it has a comprehensive incomplete feel to it.  Unless this is a setup for a sequel, the betrayal and plot-twists leave far too many loose ends and only end up screwing the viewer.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the details and characters were well developed and compelling.  The depth of the story is superb, and the gritty realism of the drugged out music culture - particularly the Johnny Quid character, brilliantly performed by Toby Kebbell - provides a dark, cynical aspect to the entire storyline.  Like the famous ""Archie Slap"" described and executed in the movie, I'm left with a feeling that I've been affected, but I'm not quite sure what happened.",1234310400,2,1698,4.722033898305085
3571909,4,B001FB55YE,"There may be only a few surefire things when it comes to movie-going these days, but one of the surest is that, in any film written and directed by Guy Ritchie, your mind will have to race mighty fast just to keep up with all the characters and plot conniptions that will go speeding by you through the course of the story.

His latest film, ""RocknRolla"" is clearly no exception to that rule.  The movie contains virtually all of the patented Ritchie trademarks familiar to us from such works as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and the truly incomprehensible ""Snatch""  (though viewers should know that ""RocknRolla"" is nowhere near as complicated as that film).  Like those others, this movie is bursting at the seams with an assortment of colorful criminal types, flashes of wicked humor, sudden explosions of violence, pitch-perfect performances, a too-cool-for-school rock soundtrack, and whipsaw editing guaranteed to leave you with a serious crick in your neck by the time the experience is over.

As usual, the criminals are culled from virtually every strata of London society, running the gamut from corrupt real estate moguls to two-bit henchmen who seem always to be one step away from being rubbed out themselves.  This latter group includes ""300""'s Gerard Butler, Idris Elba (Stringer Bell in ""The Wire"") and Tom Hardy as a trio of crooks known affectionately around town as ""The Wild Bunch.""  Tom Wilkinson is the high-stakes financier and local mob boss whose territory is being muscled into by a Russian real estate tycoon played by Karel Roden.  In addition, Thandie Newton appears as an icy-cool accountant who is risking all by playing both sides off one another; Toby Kebbell shows up as a rock star junkie who amazingly winds up holding most of the key cards in his hand; and Jeremy Piven rounds out the cast as one of a pair of record producers who gets dragged into the whole bloody business against his better judgment.  First-rate performances all.

We're told that ""RocknRoller"" is only the first entry in what is intended to be a crime drama trilogy.  If that's the case, we await with baited breath the next two installments.",1234051200,,2157,4.898351648351649
3571920,4,B001FB55YE,"A number of years ago young director Guy Ritchie changed mobster movies with his infectious LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and that twisted underbelly of London's crime population is back in full force with ROCKNROLLA. Ritchie's style - mixing rapid action, flashback explanations, loopy violence, wildly imaginative characters, and a near non-understandable collection of various accents from the British Isles coupled with an integral musical score - makes this tale of deceit, desperation, intrigue, vice in all forms, low on the food chain criminals at service in the line of polished professionals - a fast paced highly entertaining movie.

The script (yes, by Ritchie, too) combines narration with live conversation, a trait that can be distracting, but that in Ritchie's hands adds a layer of commentary and needed background that helps the viewer keep the many bits and pieces of plots screwed together. The Old School crime lord is played by Tom Wilkinson in a role far different from his previous roles. His nemesis is the New School crime lord Russian Uri (Karel Roden) with odd demands and a 'lucky painting' we never see. Gerard Butler pals with Idris Elba and the gay character Morne Botes in a back and forth series of thwarted attempts to gain status in the smarmy crime world headed by Wilkinson. The name character of Rocknrolla (pop star Johnny Quid) is well played by Toby Kebbell, Thandie Newton offers the touch of glamour as a twisted accountant, and Jeremy Piven, Chris Bridges (Ludacris), Jimi Mistry and narrator/star Archie (Mark Strong) pull it all together.

This film definitely has an audience for those who appreciate the skills of Ritchie as writer/director. For others, it may be a bit hard to follow the technique of dishing out this tangled tale. Grady Harp, February 09",1233446400,3,1811,5.073825503355705
3571921,5,B001FB55YE,"Guy Ritchie does it again. Drugs, chase scene with russians, an elevator filled with a guys brains, and an old dude getting the bejesus beaten out of him.

3571923,4,B001FB55YE,"Initially, I was fagged by this film even with Gerard Butler's pretty mug looking into the cameras, but as I caught the hang of it, the lay of the land, so to speak, with land swindles and all, finally the combo of humor and violence grabbed me, you know. It was ""RocknRolla""--some serious playing, going-down-kind-of-stuff. So I go along for the ride.

It was like watching a kind of weird fairy tale about an ogre, Lenny, who owns the entire land, the underworld land. He is in control. If he says it, everyone says it. He is THE ruler until another ogre comes in. Ogres can cast special spells. The second ogre comes from Russia, you know, the land of ballet and hopping music. This ogre is younger and more handsome and tougher, although he is smooth with his beautiful young accountant (Thandie Newton). She arranges not one, but two heists of millions of his money. He knows it, but since he admires her brains and her beauty, he allows it--that is until his lucky painting comes between them.

This is a complicated story no matter who tells it. Two trolls that Lenny dupes decide to get even. They work with Thandie. Later One-Two (that's the gorgeous Gerard Butler) and Thandie mix it up in bed. That Guy Ritchie is a sharp director--who thought a sex scene could be funny and un-sexy?

Remember that nice-looking ogre from Russia? One-Two and two of his buds take the money from two of the Russian's trolls who come after them. Cars wreck, train tunnels are involved, a chase scene on foot--it's a case of which trolls have more endurance. Pretty funny stuff.

There's a water dipping scene with some scary crawfish. There's a gay dancing scene. Then comes famous singer Johnny Quid, playing dead because--hey, he almost is dead from so many drugs. But after his ""death,"" his records take off. You know, RocknRolla.

Oh, yes, a painting gets passed around and causes broken legs, a sado-sex scene, and other mishaps. It's a real comedy of errors. Meanwhile, Lenny learns that power is not permanent and that his foster son, Johnny Quid cleans up real well. RocknRolla!

Guy Ritchie--as they say, he the man!",1233187200,,2117,4.692722371967655

Character development is definitely Ritchie's strong suit.  Johnny Quid is the alternate universe equivalent to Sid Vicious if Nancy had never existed.
Something that never lacks in a Ska film is the Soundtrack.  My God! this is some great music!  Using the song Bank Robber by the Clash as Johnny Quid's theme music was dead on.
Hopefully this will be the movie to get Guy Ritchie out of movie jail.  Swept Away and Revolver were pretty damn bad.  Getting rid of the dead weight in his life has to have helped.",1233100800,2,787,4.531914893617022

Regardless, Rocknrolla is one hundred percent Guy Ritchie. He's truly a master at directing the juxtaposition of fast-action sequences with sight and sound. The plot is a little involved but not too hard to follow. Everyone is well-cast, including Gerard Butler who continues to impress me. (Check him out in ""Dear Frankie"" to see him in a completely different role.) Tom Wilkinson did a heck of a job as well. And Thandie Newton adds just the right amount of eye candy. The dance scene with her and Gerard is classic!
