8389952,3,B0036F9C3W,"The quality of this DVD-R is probably on the same level as Alpha's and other low-end public domain companies. Not great, and even borderline unacceptable at times. But, unless Warner Archives decides to release the original RKO vault prints of Breen's films, or Breen's own entertainment business in Florida produces better film elements, I'm afraid this DVD will have to do -- if you are a Bobby Breen fan, that is.

Com'on, Warner Archive -- cough 'em up!",1298246400,,457,4.858974358974359
