2726597,5,B000M7XRAG,"These movies will be watched and watched.  Fargo is reminiscent of our lives having been raised Wisconsin.  It warmed our hearts and made us choose to return to Wisconsin, despite the snow and cold!

Raising Arizona is just plain funny!!  Because of the slapstick involved, one could envision some of the mishaps appearing on David Letterman and Jay Leno in their ""stupid criminal acts"" segments!

It's no wonder the Coen bros win all those academy awards!!!",1204070400,,458,4.973684210526316

Two of the funniest films ever made, by two of the best filmakers of this century, packaged in one set- it is literally a steal!  Raising Arizona is a 'must see' in my opinion; aside from the brilliant cinematogrophy, Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter are nothing short of brilliant. If you haven't seen this films, do yourself a favor. If you have seen them, these are two that belong in everyone's collection- and I am not a big proponent of owning movies.",1198195200,,615,6.057471264367816

2726611,5,B000M7XRAG,What's not to like.  Fargo has always been a favorite and with the TV show now that is so popular we had to refresh our memory of the original. Francis is as adorable as ever.  Thanks for a great performance.,1401235200,,208,4.175

2726616,5,B000M7XRAG,"Raising Arizona: Funniest chase ever devised; John Goodman steals the show as the incorrigible escaped con.
Fargo: Having known and lived among the citizens of Minnesota' this movie nails the attitudes and speech patterns perfectly. Throw in an average winter for Minnesota and North Dakota and the scenes are perfect for the locale. Comedy mixed with drama, pratfalls combined with gore, this movie hits every button!",1328486400,,418,5.348484848484849
2726617,5,B000M7XRAG,"I bought this for a gift and did not view it.  I have seen both of them and esp liked Raising Arizona.  In my opinion Fargo is a bit strange, but never the less, entertaining.  It arrived before the estimated date and was in excellent condition.",1284768000,,245,4.282608695652174
2726618,5,B000M7XRAG,"Raising Arizona is probably the funniest show I have ever seen. Cage and Hunter just nailed the characters, I can't even imagine anyone else pulling this off.

Fargo - Offbeat, plausible, and surprising!  Another Cohen Bros classic!",1232323200,,232,5.243243243243243
