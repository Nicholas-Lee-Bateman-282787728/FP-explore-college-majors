4569053,3,B0054KCVO4,"Mark Anthony Turnage's ambitious opera Anna Nicole is a scathing indictment of American celebrity culture, materialism and media hype. It's an opera about the things in society that have replaced opera in the popular culture. Its focus, the rise and fall of a girl from Texas named Vicki Lynn Hogan, who became an international celebrity as Anna Nicole Smith.

Mr. Turnage's score incorporates modern percussion, jazz elements, vaudeville and pure burlesque, underpinned with the clashing, slab-like chords that are beloved of modern composers. He also knows how to write a vocal line for Anna herself and the constant onstage chorus, mixing speech and song with acidic word-play that is sometimes too clever for its own good. The libretto (by Richard Thomas, co-creator of Jerry Springer: The Opera) is one of the work's strong suits, and does not once tone down its language, taking pleasure in the profanity of American English.

An example: at the end of the first act, Mr. Turnage fragments and twists the wedding music from Lohengrin as Anna is married off to 89-year-old oil billionaire J. Howard Marshall. The reference is made, then shattered, twisted and musically glued back together to illustrate the fragmented state of American that led to the celebrity rise of the title character. Irony becomes idiom, three words that describe the music of this opera and the life of its curiously vacant title character.

The score changes idiom in the second act as Anna gets settled into married life. In the ""Jimmy Choo"" duet, an ode to fetishism and greed is built  around the onomatopoeic sound of the famous designer's name. Mr. Turnage lays on the orchestral textures, moving out of the jazz idiom as Anna balloons in weight, gets further hooked on drugs and falls from grace. Here the music references Stravinsky, Bernstein and Copland. In the last pages of Anna's life, the musical idiom regresses even further, looking back towards Verdi and Puccini as the tragedy spools out.

Eva-Marie Westbroek takes a bravura turn in the title role of the stripper-turned-celebrity-turned would-be heiress. She veers from vapid, girlish innocence into a Faustian bargain with her plastic surgeon Dr. Yes (Andrew Rees). Once her breasts are augmented, Ms. Westbroek does a great job of managing the same physical challenges that were faced by Ms. Smith, acting out the pain and drug addiction in chilling detail.

This is a vocally difficult role, with high, soaring dramatic lines over a sometimes thundering orchestra. Anna goes from raw, idealized sex appeal to an obese nightmare wolfing down pizza, Twinkies and Jif peanut butter as her decline accelerates and the story moves into the 21st century. The Act II scene played  in front of the Smith refrigerator is like Hnsel und Gretel gone to hell, with Stern (Gerald Finley) as a drug-dealing witch. The work mines a deep tragic vein with the overdose of Anna's semi-autistic son Danny and the final tragic death of Anna herself.

The sugar daddies--er, baritonal leads are taken by fine singing actors. As J. Howard Marshall, Alan Oke is a talented physical actor, showing the octogenarian's mix of frailty and lust with good comic timing. He even manages a twisted chemistry with his 26-year-old bride--one sees that they understand and even sort of love each other. Mr.  Finley is brilliant (though poorly recorded) as sleaze-bag lawyer/drug dealer/pimp Stern. Susan Bickley gives a searing portrait of Anna's mother Virgie, a stern law-and-order type who evokes Holly Hunter in Raising Arizona. Mention must also be made of Peter Hoare, dead-on as CNN fixture Larry King.

Although this is a valuable record of the opera's premiere, the production of this DVD was clearly rushed. Sound balance is messy and flawed--probably caused by the issues of hiding microphones from the audience and balancing a large band in the house, a small one onstage and the rock elements in the score. Voices are poorly caught and occasionally drop out altogether. The camera occasionally doesnt know where to look for the action onstage.

There is no question that Mr. Turnage built an important opera from the ashes of Vicky Lynn Hogan's life and career. For now this DVD presentation from OpusArte is the best that New Yorkers can hope for at the moment.",1325635200,6,4295,5.069405099150142
4569054,4,B0054KCVO4,"What does a contemporary opera composer like Mark-Anthony Turnage do when he is commissioned by the Royal Opera of Great Britain to write an opera based on pop culture icon Anna Nicole Smith and he needs a lyricist? He chooses one like Richard Thomas who wrote the lyrics for ""Jerry Springer: The Opera"", about another pop icon. (A few years back there was also an opera titled ""Nancy and Tonya"" - about the figure skaters - but neither Turnage nor Thomas were involved in that one.)

Most folks - myself included - will come to the DVD of the 2011 production out of curiosity and be surprised that it is fairly entertaining. Then again, this is the Royal Opera Company after all, and the production values are high. Remembering that the audience who saw the production included on this DVD were not 100% sure of what they would see and hear, the viewer will find it interesting to hear the audience reaction. The performance was recorded at a full stage performance and includes both close-ups (though usually full body length shots) and with the full stage shown (better seen on a large screen TV). They even include the ""please turn off your cell phones"" announcement so you can feel you are really in the theater!

There are already a few other lengthy reviews posted here on Amazon so I will try to just add to them without being too repetitive.

First, you should know from the get go that there is language you will probably never hear on the opera stage - certain the Royal. There are many sexual phrases (befitting this Playmate of the Year who had her ""15 minutes of fame"" on cable TV, where strong language is common. Just be ready when the F- and S- words start flying out of the mouths of the singers. And if you aren't sure that's what you heard, you have the options of English subtitles, which - though the opera is sung in English - I found helpful. (be aware when using the subtitles that they are sometimes at top of the screen and sometimes at the bottom. And, speaking of ""top"", both Dutch soprano Eva-Maria Westbrook, as well as the ""lap dance"" and ""pole dancing"" girls, is bodacious with a LOT of cleavage to show. (For the second act, where Smith gains weight as she starts hitting drugs and food binges, Westbrook dons a ""far suit"")

As an opera this is really just a curiosity, since 10 years from now - probably less - Smith's name will be forgotten. And musically, though the DVD has 33 chapter stops to go to scenes identified by phrases, there really are no full arias for the cast. I'm not an opera expert - I admit that going in - but it appeared to be mostly singing dialogue.

The principals are excellent as is the whole cast and - unlike many operas - this one clocks in at just under two hours (including the curtain call.)

A bit of music celebrity is added with the inclusion of three rock musicians - Peter Erskine, John Paul Jones, and John Paricelli - though they certainly don't stand out while listening and, though there are supposed to be influences of ""jazz"" in the score, I certainly didn't hear it. (Maybe a bit of ""Broadway"", but certainly not ""jazz"".)

The bonuses include a short slide show of cast profiles (no bios, just photos) and an 8-minute ""making of"" which is mildly informative. There is more detail in the essay in the booklet, which has text in French and German as well as English.

Oh, and did I forget?...... Included in the package are 6 ""exclusive postcards"" of scenes from the opera.

I'm glad I watched this DVD and was entertained. Like Anna Nicole Smith, this is a ""pop culture"" icon that will have it's brief time in the spotlight - captured on video for future generations (who may scratch their heads wondering about pole dancing and ""reality shows""). I wonder, is anyone reviving ""Jerry Springer: The Opera""?)

I hope you found this review both helpful and entertaining.

4569056,4,B0054KCVO4,"There are many reasons that one could cite for not taking the life of Anna Nicole Smith and turning it into opera but most of the reasons could also be - as Mark-Anthony Turnage would say - are all cause to do just that. The rags to riches to fast, tragic downfall story of the stripper turned Playboy centerfold turned model is in so many ways crude, tragic, sad and almost that of an ""anti-heroine""  Anna Nicole Smith as a tragic example of what could go wrong with ""the American dream"" is, indeed, operatic in its melodrama. Actually, the libretto by Richard Thomas goes almost to parody in its attempt to show what might be the seemingly flawed underside of American culture. There are few protected icons here. Thomas takes jabs at everything from Wal Mart to Larry King to plastic surgery to the poor white south. In fact, many of the characters are played as very ""over the top"" stereotypes for the intended effect, such as Anna's parents, her first husband, her self-serving lawyer and her leering billionaire husband, J. Howard Marshall. The first half of the opera does have a bit of a specious tone to it. The jibes and the occasional dark humor are quite obvious but by the time the second half comes in, Thomas and Turnage let us see Anna Nicole the under educated, silicone enhanced pawn of an industry that doesn't seem to really care about her as a person. So does it work and would the general public like this piece? The answers are both guardedly ""yes'  First, this is not really for the easily offended.  The language is rough, including multiple uses of the big ""F"" word, some overt references to female breasts and their colloquial designation and some drug use. It is, first and foremost, a tragic story about some crude people. The music, like most of that of Mark-Anthony Turnage is strange, but very accessible; in this case, with a distinct jazz-pop feel. The staging is garish and bright but very effective and key vocal roles are really performed well, most notably Eva-Maria Westbroek as Anna and Gerald Finley as her shark of a lawyer.  Her only child, Danny, who is shown first as a young boy and later as a late teen who gets trapped in drug use and ends up dead is mostly a silent role, save for a short poignant set piece near the end, but is sad to watch. The whole story and the theater of the work itself is almost cringe inducing. We know this will all turn out very badly and Anna Nicole Smith is not sort of girl most folks would welcome as a next door neighbor but Turnage succeeds in bring the human tragedy to life. It is almost like reading a tabloid and then realizing - wait, this was a real person that this actually happened to. ""Anna Nicole"", which premiered at the Royal Opera, London just this past February, did shock the audience more than a bit but the presentation is good; the opera does not wear itself out at all either through duration, sensationalism and, certainly not, musically.  There have been other contemporary works on the sad and shocking aspects of contemporary public figures such as ""Jackie O"" by Michael Daugherty or ""Tania"" by Anthony Davis but this work of Turnage has a tangible, confrontational pathos to it - right down to Anna's closing ""I want to blow you all ... a kiss"" - as she zips her own body bag that not all will like but I think is well worth looking at to see for yourself.",1320019200,2,3364,4.517241379310345
4569057,4,B0054KCVO4,"Wow! This was a bit of a surprise, having read those cranky British reviewers about `Anna Nicole', I had very low expectations. As with my previous rants about Opera, It's about the music stupid, and this music does not disappoint. In fact there are parts that make it a shoe in for the best opera. This century. So far (that I've heard/seen anyway).

The composer Turnage is no hack and I find it so annoying that because he uses pop and jazz vernaculars he is somehow labeled a sell-out or incapable of doing anything with depth.  The opposite is true. He clearly knows classical repertoire and his integration of commercial idioms is completely seamless and often contributes to the freshness of the composition (love the angular jazz `heads' stylistically half way between Zappa and Torke). `Lulu' constantly springs to mind, not stylistically, but the sophisticated level of integration of low and highbrow and the often-stunning musical results. One of his greatest gifts is his seamless transitions from one section to the next. He has set himself on a razor's edge between `numbers' opera and through-composed music and the psychology menace and vulnerability is clearly in the stuff in-between. Gradually transitioning colors from dark to light and back gives it a constant psychedelic glow with not a lot of gray orchestration or harmonic tiredness. The particularly strong music is in the stripper pole music and the ------- scene (I can't believe I just wrote that). There is a level of eroticism that rivals Kundry's scenes in the second act of Parsifal, Tristan and Isolde and again Lulu. It's a great mystery how music has the capability to express the power of human sexuality--equally so, how easy music can make sex comic or banal. I wish there was the power of those two brief scenes throughout the opera but Turnage is not Wagner, so get over it. My biggest disappointment was the music after the curtain drops in the second act starting with Howard Stern's Aria. It is like the air came out of the tires, musically and dramaturgically, (not to mention staging) that it felt literally like they ran out of time or money or both. Everything up to there is a delight--the entire first act having many, many good set pieces (loved the wedding scene and the quartet writing at the end of act 1). One criticism that I read in those cranky Brit reviews, and that I have to agree with, was Turnage was a little too locked into the libretto and didn't let some sections breathe more. Once the composer stumbles onto some good music, he should give those sections space to expand and articulate a bigger contour (see stripper pole /-------- scenes). It was all a bit claustrophobic in the intensity of the pacing-- but that's better than being too slow and dragging.

Speaking of the libretto, the librettist Thomas does a masterful job of balancing the profane and the profound though gratefully he doesn't dwell on the latter. Besides being about Anna Nicole it is a Eurocentric view of America: the media, class-struggle, fame, sex, drugs, -even though that pretty much sums up her life. Much has been made about the profanity or rhyming couplet, potty jokes but none of it seemed forced or inappropriate-- to me, anyway, but maybe I'm tainted by watching too many episodes of the Kardashians. The gutterness is always mixed with reflectiveness to give it a context. As far as the libretto contributing to the collapse of the operas structure in the 2nd act, it's difficult to know whether the contour is not there in the text or the wheels fell off the composer (to stretch an earlier metaphor about the air coming out of the tires). Only they probably really know.

One of the fantastic aspects of the DVD is the chorus singing. You'll never find so many great singers in one room other than in London. Perfect articulations, rhythms, and pitch ---English opera companies are truly blessed by the heritage of a great choral tradition. Since the chorus seems on stage for 80% of the great parts, it is safe to say a lot of the great music is while they are singing. And it also seems Turnage has a soft spot for the English choral tradition, as it is his best music.

As for the characters: Eve-Marie Westrook stoled the show with her pouty vulnerability and brash sexiness. I was less enthralled with her singing as there is some mush in parts of her tessitura and her uber-heavy vibrato in some held notes (in parts of her tessitura). For me, too much heavy Italian opera and not enough light Kurt Weill. Inversely, for all the opposite reasons, I was totally won by 3 of the cast: Andrew Rees (doctor Yes), Alan Oke (Howard Marshall) and Susan Bickley (Anna's mom and voice of moral authority).

The staging costume, and choreography was all suitably crass and over the top stunning, as well the DVD production (Opus Arte) was beautifully presented.

One final note is the opera hired 3 legendary, rock heavy-weights to be the power trio at the centre of the orchestration. Whether it was for street cred, or publicity, Peter Erskine, John Paul Jones and John Parricelli, dusted off their instruments, left their respective castles and massage therapists (all aging musicians have massage therapists) and did a really great job.

Highly, highly recommended.",1319587200,2,5275,4.827433628318584
4569058,4,B0054KCVO4,"Dealing with a low-brow subject, treating it to an outlandish and tasteless staging, with crude language and bad-taste humour, there is a danger that Anna Nicole, an opera by Mark Anthony Turnage about the former Playboy model who died of a drug overdose in 2007, could be accused of making Eurotrash out of American Trash, but the language and the staging befits the tone of its subject.  The barrage of rhyming couplets in the libretto from Richard Thomas (Jerry Springer the Opera) may clearly signal their intention to rhyme at the end with four-letter words and other mildly shocking profanities, but at the same time there is wit and pathos here in a libretto that actually manages to cut through the niceties directly to harsh crude reality of the circumstances of Anna Nicole Smith's life, unpalatable though that might be to the average opera-going audience.  Benjamin Britten and particularly Billy Budd comes to mind in the use of language, in its subject - which is also about a kind of loss of innocence on a bigger level than just the personal - and in Turnage's score, which also adopts his usual jazz and American influences, successfully finding the right tone for each occasion.

The colourful, tastefully tacky set-designs by Richard Jones also adopt the right tone with plenty of eye-catching sights not commonly seen in an opera house, including a sequence in a lap-dancing parlour replete with artificial breast-enhanced women twirling themselves gymnastically and provocatively from poles.  The decision to present the opera as if it were a reality-TV show in which a chorus of TV hosts interview Anna Nicole, already dead but looking back over her life and tracing the path from smalltown girl to media celebrity that will ultimately lead to her destruction, is a masterstroke and it imbues the piece with a slightly sinister edge that grows as the opera proceeds.  The tone darkens considerably by the second half, when it does indeed become a tragedy, as the people in Smith's life disappear to be replaced by masses of ominous black figures with TV cameras for heads.

Antonio Pappano, conducting the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, does well to allow the music score to assert its presence and not be overshadowed by the spectacle or the libretto.  Eva-Maria Westbroek is marvellous in the title role, and well supported by Gerald Finlay and Alan Oke.  As a Wagnerian soprano, Westbroek is however not really tested by the limited singing demands of the role, but she sings exceptionally well and manages to bring out the inherent humanity of her character, never letting her be merely an icon, nor indeed, allowing the performance to descend into parody.  Whether the opera ultimately has anything new to say or whether it touches on anything deeper in its subject - if indeed there anything deeper to be drawn from its subject - is questionable, but Anna Nicole demonstrates nonetheless that opera can still be a vital artform to address contemporary subjects in a powerful manner that can connect with a modern audience.

On Blu-ray from Opus Arte, the opera - opening with a legal disclaimer that it is ""not intended to be an actual factual depiction of any person"" - looks every bit as bold as it should, the striking colours deeply saturated, with strong blacks and contrasts, and a good level of detail.  This often looks just stunning, and it is well filmed, picking out the singers at the right moments, while also allowing the overall impact of the set to be appreciated.  The audio tracks in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 are also effective in allowing the detail of the musical arrangements to come through.  Subtitles are in English (so you can check that they actually sang what you thought they sang but couldn't quite believe), French, German and Spanish.  Aside from a Cast Gallery, the only other extra on the disc is a brief Production Report (8:25), introduced by Pappano, which nonetheless covers the development of the opera well with interviews with Turnage, Thomas and Westbroek.",1308096000,33,4044,4.936671575846834

8456777,5,B0054KCVO4,"I had no idea what to expect of this DVD.  It seemed like an odd choice for an opera - the memory of a tragic life wasted is still too searing and sad.
However, thanks to the masterful Turnage, this opera is an absolute triumph.  The music is modern, twisted, dissonant at times, and yet tremendously exciting and engaging throughout the entire show.

The real triumph of this DVD lies in the phenomenal performance of Eva Maria Westbroek.  She sounds absolutely thrilling in this daunting and enormous role. She overcomes every vocal challenge, and sings the whole role sumptuously.  The fact that she is a brilliant actress, and that she eerily resembles the real Anna Nicole only adds to the gripping performance.

The rest of the supporting cast is equally well put together. Susan Bickley as Anna Nicole's mother is perfectly shrewish and cruel; Gerald Finley is flawless as the slimy and overbearing lawyer Howard Stern, and Alan Oke puts in a very worthwhile performance as Anna Nicole's billionaire husband.

The production and the libretto are alike in that neither shies away from the inherent violence and vulgarity of the story, and yet never seem to be over the top.  There is a fair amount of cursing, which feels quite natural given the subject.  The production by Richard Jones serves to illuminate the tragic story of Anna Nicole, but lets the viewer decide where the turning point in her life was, where the blame lies, and never judges her - rather, the production illustrates how sad her life was and asks ""did she ever have a chance?""",1329955200,,1555,4.794007490636704
