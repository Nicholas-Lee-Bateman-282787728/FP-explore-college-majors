I'm glad I did, because the story is great. I've since then seen the film again in its entirety and liked it even more. A woman marries a cad who drinks, cheats, gambles all their money, and meets his untimely demise. Later she marries a more respectable man who can take good care of her (read boring). Boy is she surprised when the ghost of her first marriage comes back spice things up a bit. The end of the movie is perfect and makes it all worthwhile, watch it and see. I spoke to a Brazilian who said this movie has a bad reputation as just soft porn and not a good representation of Brazilian movies, but then again, he had never seen it! It is really worth watching if you can find a copy.",1141344000,2,854,4.150602409638554
