Huey and the guys took some old time rhythm & blues songs and just belted them out in this intimate setting.  Songs like Stagger Lee, Blue Monday, Little Bitty Pretty One, Shake Rattle and Roll, and so many more; takes you back quite a few years.  (Little Bitty Pretty One was my favorite!)  Sam Moore and Lloyd Price coming out singing, just made it so much more special.  Highly recommended for all Huey Lewis and the News Fans, and fans of ole rhythm and blues!!!",1289088000,,549,4.608247422680412

7844030,5,6303276768,This is a concert showing Huey Lewis & the News at their best.  They play most of the four chords songs..and then a few hits.  The only bad thing about this tape is 10 of the songs are not in color..they are shown  on a gray seen.for the old image i guess..but everything else is great!,961027200,,286,4.071428571428571
7844031,5,6303276768,This video shows Huey Lewis still has all the energy and talent he displayed in the 80's. He can still rock with the best of them. Go Huey!!!!!,914371200,,143,4.142857142857143
