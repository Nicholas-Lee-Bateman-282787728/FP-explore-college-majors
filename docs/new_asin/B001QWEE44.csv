3771214,5,B001QWEE44,"Paramore's The Final RIOT! rocks Chicago with a killer 15 song set. The contagious energy is electric - the amazing 1080p video quality and Dolby TrueHD create an ""as-if-you-were-there"" experience.  The special features include a Paramore documentary that is fun, quirky, and gives an insider's perspective to life on the road with Paramore.  As a TWILIGHT FAN, I am stoked to have bonus Twilight soundtrack clips with unbelievable audio.  ""The Decode"" music video plays back in 720p and ""I Caught Myself"" audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD.  This Blu-ray rocks! A+.",1238716800,,565,5.175824175824176

3771216,5,B001QWEE44,Fantastic band of Twilight fame and another band who's female lead has a tremendous voice.,1453420800,,90,5.066666666666666
3771217,4,B001QWEE44,"This disc is pretty old now but as far as I know it's the only live disc Paramore has released, so I picked it up just recently now that it's cheap. For the price I paid (under 5 bucks here on Amazon), it's impossible to really complain. But I still want to review the disc as I would any other, since for some reason they're choosing to keep it as the only live disc you can buy. They really should release something new.

This disc captures them at a point in time when they were just starting to hit it big. They all look very young, and they only had three albums worth of material to choose from for their live shows. They still have kind of an indie rock mentality on stage; they're unpolished, they all just kind of do what they want without much coordination, and they sound really raw. I saw them at Madison Square Garden a year or so ago and it was a lot different; they've grown up since this disc. (And of course, the band itself has changed even since then, in ways you may or may not be a fan of.)

Maybe the biggest change when I saw them vs. this disc was that they now interact a lot more on stage - they mostly all do their own individual thing on this disc, which is a little strange to see for a band but may also be because of their youth. They all seem to be concentrating really, really hard, and except for Hayley and Jeremy, not having that much fun. These days I think they've learned to loosen up a bit and let it all hang out a little more. (And I guess at least a couple of them *weren't* having much fun, since they left the band after this.)

That said, the music's all pretty great, with the only ""low"" point maybe being ""We Are Broken"", which is just a little flat and gets extended even beyond its album length. Sometimes I do wish Hayley would kind of stand still a little more - she sounds better and hits her notes a little more often when she's not jumping around - but that's just the way she is, and the crowd always seems to like it, so maybe it's just me. I'd rather hear her voice than see her hopping around like a bunny.

Hearing Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" when I was expecting Paramore's was a pretty interesting surprise, but I wish Hayley had sung it with a little more subtlety. Maybe she would now, eight years later. They do follow up with their own ""Hallelujah"", for those who don't know or care about Leonard Cohen's song. (They are entirely different songs that just happen to share the same name.)

As for the disc's production values, it's a little weird. I agree with those who say it's maybe not the best - there's a lot of stuff that's hard to tell if it's a style or a technical problem. For example, one camera angle always has what looks like analog crosstalk, as if the cable wasn't connected properly - or maybe it's a video filter? If it is, it's hard to see what they were going for. There are also a lot of jumps and stutters in the video, which again are *probably* a style? Like they were going for a ""snapshot"" or slow motion effect, but it's at totally random times and has no rhyme or reason. These freeze frames don't capture Hayley or anyone else in a particular pose or anything, they just occur at any time. At first I thought it was actually my PS4 acting up, but eventually it started looking like it was on purpose, it's just kind of clumsily done.

The sound isn't bad but it isn't great either; it's a little muffled sounding, but also lacking in bass. I do appreciate its rawness, though; I dislike when bands try to ""fix"" stuff they played live for a disc release. Every mistake and every off-key note is here on the disc. That's the way it should be. Good performances aren't measured by stuff like that anyway.

There's also the music video for ""Decode"" (in really bad SD but with HD audio), HD audio only for ""I Caught Myself"" and a 40 minute behind the scenes featurette.

If you're a fan of the band, you probably need this disc. But it's no longer representative of where they are right now; we'll just have to hope they release a new live disc sometime soon.",1452643200,,4050,4.271186440677966

3771234,3,B001QWEE44,"First of all, I really like Paramore and I was so excited to find this Blu-ray for only 50 cents at a local thrift store!! :-) I'm mostly just copying my review from a comment I made on another review... I understand that most Amazon reviewers are kind of the average viewer or listener, and honestly most Paramore fans are teenagers or in their 20's. In other words, most don't have years and years of musical knowledge to draw comparison to thousands of other bands and recordings. I'm in my 30's and I've been doing music my entire life, internationally, in all genres - both professionally and as a hobby - so I have more knowledge than the average person. For those who want a little more information than a generic review I'm providing more details regarding the issues with this Blu-ray. My education background is a music business degree with music performance and audio production emphasis from a well-known university in Nashville. Anyway, I will try to shed a little light on this Blu-ray for those who are wanting a realistic critique... keep in mind some of this is in response to other reviews where people weren't properly addressing the issues.

1) The audio/video ""lag"" issue... one reviewer is actually correct in saying that there is NO lag issue on this Blu-ray... there is PERCEIVED LAG on nearly all concert video... if you watch enough of them you will see that. The reason for the lag is the difference in milliseconds between the camera capturing the image and the sound entering the microphones/cables. There were probably around 24+ channels of audio for this concert (in high quality 48kHz probably), all of which are directly touching the drumset, each singer's mouth, or connected to the amps from the guitars, bass, etc. These record the audio in real-time... however the cameras are all at varying distances from the musicians, receiving the image a few milliseconds later than the mics/cable lines. You will notice the farther away the camera is, the more lag you notice between the audio and video. The reason is just a few milliseconds that can't really be corrected in a live recording situation.

2) Audio quality... yes this Blu-ray (like all) uses high quality audio, in the sense that they use a 48kHz sampling rate and split it into 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. In that sense it is ""high quality"". However this Blu-ray is NOT HIGH QUALITY IN TERMS OF THE MIX, and quite frankly seems to be done with very little effort. What I mean is the clarity of each instrument is terrible and equates to a bad mix overall for an audiophile (someone who really loves listening to music with a more critical ear). [Someone who spends $500 on a pair of headphones is probably an audiophile.] :)  In this mix you can barely hear the bass over most of this Blu-ray... is that because the bass player played wrong or the situation didn't allow the editors to properly include it in the mix? No. They simply didn't put any effort into mixing it right. The bass drum is super quiet even if I turn my sub WAY up... I have a 10"" subwoofer in my living room with a WOOD FLOOR... with most audio I can turn the sub down to NEGATIVE 10dB and it's still really loud. With how many channels they are recording, there's NO reason not to get a good mix. Yes it is more difficult to get a good mix in a live concert setting compared to the studio. But it can ALWAYS be done, especially by people who are paid the big bucks and who mix recordings all day, every day. This Blu-ray is just lazy mixing. The studio probably wanted a quick turn-around time so the editor completed it in a few days and got his paycheck. Even when I was a 3rd year student I could have done a better live mix than this.

Those are my only issues with it. The band is great, the performance is good, and even the fun things they did with the video were cool... it's a good Blu-ray overall. It's just not the high quality mix I generally expect from a Blu-ray concert disc. Anyway I bought this for 50 cents at a 2nd hand store so I really can't complain can I? :) If I had paid $20-30 for this I definitely would have been upset though.

I love this band ... they should more closely guard their image and not allow products like this out there.

If you want to do a comparison and see a concert that truly glorifies hi-def video and audio on bluray, check out ""Queen - Live in Budapest"". It was recorded nearly 30 years ago, and I was awe struck by the quality. It will definitely get multiple viewings, and sadly ""Final Riot"" will disappear onto a shelf never to be seen again.

Hayley Williams doesn't spare her neck any rest; her headbanging is fun to watch. Zac Farro complements her energy level nicely behind the drum kit, and it is always exciting to watch a drummer who isn't a zombie on the drums and physically displays the passion of his playing. Overall, the musicianship and performance is sharp, and the members give everything they have for the fans.

They are all attractive 20-somethings who can play; and in the case of front woman Haley Williams, sing.  What's missing is some back up singing.  Lead guitarist Josh Farro tries but he's weak and adds nothing.  I don't normally notice drummers frankly but this guy, Zac Farro is good!  The film has the usual editing and direction issues.

3771267,4,B001QWEE44,"This will be a fairly short review.  But I'm certain that I will be sure to include all the important points.

- Why I bought ""Paramore: The Final Riot!"" ?

I purchased it because I love Paramore, of course.  I just happened to be browsing the Amazon.com blu-ray section and I happened upon The Final Riot!  I've known about Paramore and listened to their music for about three (3) years, but I did not know they had filmed any concerts and released them on blu-ray.  I must say, I was quite surprised when I saw the blu-ray here, and I pretty much purchased it immediately since I'm building my blu-ray collection anyway.

- What I like.

First and foremost, the music.  You don't buy a concert blu-ray unless you really like the musicians playing.  And with Paramore, it's a case of love.  The concert set-list includes fifteen (15) of Paramore's awesome songs:

1. Born for This
2. That's What You Get
3. Here We Go Again
4. Fences
5. CrushCrushCrush
6. Let The Flames Begin
7. When it Rains
8. My Heart
9. Decoy
10. Pressure
11. For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic
12. We Are Broken
13. Emergency
14. Hallelujah
15. Misery Business

My personal favorites include 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 15.  This concert was also performed with live vocals, meaning that there was no lip syncing.  The band is very fun to watch and their lead singer Hayley Williams just makes it even better!

The video quality of the blu-ray is pretty good as well.  The concert is presented in full 1080p and the special features are in 720p.  Audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD and it is of good quality as well.  Perfect for turning up the volume!

- What I disliked.

While there wasn't anything I disliked about the blu-ray edition of ""The Final Riot!"", there are things I wish they would have added.  Included are a behind the scenes feature, ""Decode"" music video, and a bonus song ""I caught myself.""  Since this is a blu-ray, I wish they had taken advantage of the medium by adding some extra content such as production stills, maybe different versions of songs maybe in an acoustic style, and maybe even a nice little booklet to go with the blu-ray.  The only thing included with the blu-ray is a card insert that lists credits.  Who knows, maybe on their next filmed release there will be tons of extra goodies.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed!

- Final Thoughts!

Overall, this is still a good purchase despite the lack of some desired extra content listed above.  This blu-ray, ""Paramore: The Final Riot!"" is still HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by me to any fans of Paramore out there.",1271462400,6,2568,4.545851528384279
3771268,5,B001QWEE44,"First off, let me point out the video and audio are fine! There is not a lag issue with this concert. What they do is during most songs about once there is a two second delay. For example, Haley will jump off this little step on the stage and the video creators of this dvd/blu-ray (blu-ray on the review) purposely made the jump down go slower on the screen. It is always during the cool moments like jumping, head bobbing, instrument solos, etc. It is not a bad thing. I loved it. The audio is great and sounded just like they do in person. I know, I attended their 2009 Kansas City concert a few months back. The video is a 9.5/10. It is not bad and looks amazing. There are a few scenes that are very dark with mild dark blue lights on haley during an intro. Those can have a very very tiny bit fuzzy, but I really think it is a camera limitation or dvd creation tool is not amazing in dark scenes. 92% of the time the lights are blaring and the video is spot on. This is one of my favorite blu-ray concerts I own an I have quite a few. The special features are a mix bag. I love they have two additional songs. One song is in hd audio with a stable picture in the background. I have a lcd, but I turned it off during the song. I know I should be safe, but I don't want any potential for burn in. (burn in is where the image burns into your tv and you can never remove the sceen. It would be like having a mild whitish transparency over everything you watch in the future) They should have had a slideshow going, but it is minor and this is an extra feature. This is not why you bought the movie. It does include the new paramore song decode from twilight and it sounds amazing. The video is obviously too small for the size they tried to expand it to. It feels squished into the middle and it is a tiny tiny bit blocky. Some scenes worse than others. I would have rather had a second disc on dvd with this video. My playstation 3 can upscale and would have looked much better than this video that is stuck in the blocky form at a hd resolution. There is also a video about their group and planning the concert. I just skimmed this video, but it is a interesting extra if you want to know more about their group. Definitely a great blu-ray and worth the purchase if you like paramore or a couple of songs. This group is growing on me more and more. Thank you twilight for helping me discover this group as it is now in my top 3 favorite groups for 2009.",1260662400,6,2457,4.089026915113871
3771269,4,B001QWEE44,"I love Paramore so anything they do to me is great, but the quality of this Blu Ray is lacking. Its obvious its been unconverted. I have a 52"" 1080P Samsung 7 series LCD with my PS3 and it just don't look like a blu-ray. But still, Paramore makes it ok.",1254355200,,253,3.980392156862745
3771270,4,B001QWEE44,"It sounds great and looks awesome in HD.  This Paramore blu ray doesn't have the super cool blu ray pop up menu that can be accessed while the concert is playing...to see the menu you have to go back to the root menu of the disc. First blu ray I own that doesn't have that sweet feature.  I have to turn my audio receiver up higher than usual because the audio is a bit weak.  The live audio for this disc is mixed well! But, the audio and video are not synced correctly, they are slightly off.  I play drums and got frustrated watching the drummer because I saw the drummer do a sick roll...then heard the roll a second later! BOOOO! other than those minor issues it is a great concert and the blu ray is worth buying.",1252886400,,719,4.151079136690647
3771271,5,B001QWEE44,"Excellent live show. Blu-ray could be improved because I had the regular dvd and the picture look's the same. Overall
excellent show and good job Hayley and the rest of paramore. Must buy if Paramore fan.",1251676800,,204,4.694444444444445
3771272,5,B001QWEE44,"This is an absolutely amazing concert! I was just blown away by the crazy vocals and overall performance of the band. I love this blu-ray! I have a lot of concert blu-rays and THIS is my favorite. If you're a fan of Paramore, you'll absolutely love this! MUST HAVE for paramore fans.",1251244800,,283,4.461538461538462
3771273,2,B001QWEE44,"Im juming straight and to point. I have a problem with this blu ray existing. The image quality is that of a standard DVD with a few snips filmed on HD (and even those seem to be upscaled). The video quality is sub par for a blu ray. I would have been much happier paying less and getting s standard DVD. After about 25 minutes of watching, I couldn't take it anymore. I turned off the tv and let the concert play through the surround sound. I enjoy Paramore in concert but this blu ray concert I wouldnt mind never seeing again.",1242518400,2,529,4.196078431372549
3771274,5,B001QWEE44,"Why is it only available on Blu-Ray???????  I have it on my Ipod, but I would like to watch it in the comfort of my living room on my flat screen tv.  I'm not going to purchase a blu-ray dvd player just so I can watch this one dvd.",1242259200,,231,3.693877551020408
3771275,2,B001QWEE44,"I have to say that I expected more of this release. The image quality lacks detail to be (real) HD (as it was intended to be). Sound and vision are often out of sync. The concert is quite ok, so only 2 out of 5. Disappointing.",1241481600,3,226,3.9347826086956523
8336630,5,B001QWEE44,"A dated blu-ray in terms in video quality, the complete opposite in audio quality. An enjoyable experience from a long time Paramore fan!",1513296000,,137,5.0

8336633,5,B001QWEE44,"As I was getting ready for their new album release ""After Laughter "" thought I'd watch a little throwback. For under $6, it's a steal. Great concert at the Congress Theatre in Chicago(rip) with another almost hours worth of content about them preparing for the ""The Final Riot"" tour. If you're a fan, don't waste time debating it, just buy it.",1495929600,,343,4.639344262295082
