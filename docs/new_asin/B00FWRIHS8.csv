8618943,3,B00FWRIHS8,"An engineer quits his job, rents his home and buys a junkyard in the desert without consulting his wife. Then to top it all off he plans to be a mechanic, after all how hard can that be for an engineer to be a mechanic...in the desert.(Let me know how that works out).

Once you get by that, his wife, Davina Joy sports a fairly nice rack, which she is very proud of in the movie for those who require some nudity. They are worth the price of admission. The wife is eventually taken prisoner by sicko, Motorman Dan. The husband sees his wife tied to a torture chair and is forced to kill people who stop by in order to keep her alive. The husband ends up in a silly metal costume to perform the deeds.

Motorman Dan has a ""Saw"" quality to him. In the movie extras we find out that while rehearsing for the movie, Motorman Dan sneezed and did a twitch which seemed to worked pretty well. So in the movie, Dan has got a nervous twitch that adds to the psycho effect.",1451433600,,964,4.149732620320855
