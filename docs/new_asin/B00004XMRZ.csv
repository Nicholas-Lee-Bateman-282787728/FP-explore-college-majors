8462269,5,B00004XMRZ,"Al Pacino is great in these movies and the movies are so masterfully acted out. I believe that Al Pacino is one the best actors alive along with Robert DeNiro and in ""Heat"" they show that there chemistry on the  screen together is untouchable by  any other duo. The Devil's Advocate is a  great movie because it shows another side to Al Pacino's acting ability.",963792000,2,361,4.523076923076923
