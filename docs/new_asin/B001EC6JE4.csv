3549312,3,B001EC6JE4,AFTER READING ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS I PURCHASED THIS DVD. I TRIED IT TWICE AND THIS IS NOT FOR ME. FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE TITLE. I DID NOT GET THAT PARTY FEELING. THE MUSIC WAS NOT GOOD AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. THERE ARE SO MANY NICE MUSIC OUT THERE SO I JUST DON'T GET IT. THE ONLY FIRM TAPE THAT I HAVE THAT I CONSIDERED FUN IS THE FIRM TOTAL BODY FAT BLASTER (2001) THIS IS A VERY OLD TAPE BUT VERY GOOD. I USE IT VERY OFTEN.,1238371200,,445,3.795698924731183
3549313,5,B001EC6JE4,"I have TONS of Firm tapes and so I added yet another one.  I LOVE this workout! One of my new favorites!
This is the first Firm tape that I have bought in which the instructors rotate and each teach a different segment. (there may be others, just none that I have yet).  I LOVED the variety! Not only do you get 5 different cardio segments that are all different and unique, but you get the 5 different instructors so it never gets boring.
I did it this morning and the time went by real fast for 40 minutes. It really got my heartbeat up and was some great cardio.  I think this is great for all types of exercisers, from beginners to advanced, because the moves are't too, too dancy or complicated, and so it's pretty easy to get the hang of it for beginners..yet it is a great workout and still challenging enough for advancers such as myself.
FUN! I loved it! Highly recommend, I promise!",1236556800,2,892,4.2976190476190474
3549314,4,B001EC6JE4,"This was a great cardio workout!  I enjoyed the switching of instructors, it really helps the time fly by. The moves are fun and the instructors did a great job with cues. It definately got my heart rate up. The reason I gave it four stars is because there isn't a cool down.  I recommend this for all levels of exercisers =)",1236211200,2,325,4.225806451612903
3549315,2,B001EC6JE4,"I like many of the other firm dvd's, especially hi-def sculpt and hard core fusion.  But I really find this one hard to follow.  The moves are very dancey, and make me feel a little silly.  I am quite uncoordinated and prefer simpler moves that don't have such a choreographed dance routine feel to them.  You'll probably enjoy this routine if you're good at following complicated dance steps, but it's not for me.",1233014400,7,414,4.63013698630137
3549316,5,B001EC6JE4,I love the cardio party.  The instructors seem more like themselves and personable rather than an insructor in front of you.  Each one has their own section.  Allison does dance moves.  Emily works your abs while standing.  Rebecca does traditional aerobic moves like grapevines and side touches.  Annie seems to do an aerobicized toning routine without weights.  And Allie ends with Latin dance.  It has variety.  It has fun.  And the time just flies by.  It can be incorporated any day because it is just cardio.,1229472000,6,514,4.8604651162790695
3549317,5,B001EC6JE4,"I got this as part of the TranFIRMation set. And I was really surprised at how much I liked it. I felt the way they used each instructor for their own segment was cool and I think it made the time go by fast.
The choreography was really good but too dancy. It was also nice to see a more relaxed fun side of the instructors. They let loose a little more on this one.
I also think this fills the need for some cardio only workouts. If I am ramping up my workouts, sometimes it is hard to use The Firm everyday because the traditional Firm workouts always work every muscle and sometimes those muscles need a break. This really is great because I knew I could get a quality Firm cardio workout and give those muscle groups a rest!
 I agree with the previous reviewer, Annie was like a deer in head lights on this one. She looked really nervous at first. Maybe she will grow on me. Whenever there is a new instructor, they always seem to grow on me(with a few exceptions).
I am really glad I own this one.",1227225600,,1002,4.164948453608248
3549318,4,B001EC6JE4,"Previously sold as a part of a Firm multi-DVD set, Cardio Party is now offered as it's own title.  The 39 minute video features Firm master instructors Alison Davis, Emily Welsh, Rebekah Sturkie, Annie Lee and Allie Del Rio.  Each has about 8 minutes to lead the program, taking the viewer through some of their favorite moves.  If you're a Firm fan, you'll recognize alot of these combinations from other Firm videos. Emily even brings in some moves from her ""Complete Aerobics and Weight Training"", which was filmed a few years back.  When she says, ""Some of these moves might seem a little familiar to you,"" you know what she means.

Overall I enjoyed the routine, I got in a solid cardio workout and had a good time.  On this particular day it fit into my need for cardio only, so if you're looking for the Firm's signature weight training included in the workout, it's not here.  For today, that was fine with me.  It was nice to have no equipment at all required.  Just some room space and workout clothes.  I'll probably take this with me the next time I need a workout on DVD out of town.

My only quibbles with the workout: Annie Lee doesn't seem as sophisticated as the other leads, and her combinations weren't as fun.  However, they required less high-impact efforts, which was nice.  Having said that, I found the high-impact moments in the rest of the workout to be reasonable. No running in place, and the plyos weren't too prevalent.

I also wish they had spent a little more time cooling down and stretching out.  Allie closes the workout, and while she does slow things down a little and put in a few side stretches, it seemed short to me.  We didn't stretch out our hamstrings, glutes, calves, hip flexors or quads-- all of which were used quite a bunch in the routine.  Of course, I can do this on my own, but it would've been nice to have it on the DVD.

Overall though, I really liked this workout.  It was great to have time with different instructors, and knowing some of the moves from other workouts made it easier to pick up the first time.  If you enjoyed the other videos in the TransFirmation series, you'll like this one as well.  I look forward to doing it again soon!",1226534400,25,2200,4.477386934673367
3549319,4,B001EC6JE4,I like this video but it feels like I don't get enough of a workout since it goes from one person to another,1395014400,,108,3.739130434782609
3549320,4,B001EC6JE4,"Definitely gets heart rate up!  A  little hard to keep up with moves at first few viewings ,  but if you stick with it  works.",1394064000,,126,3.92
3549321,4,B001EC6JE4,"This DVD is set up differently than most of the other firm DVDs, so its a nice change.  There are 5 different instructors and they each have 10 min. Some of the moves are basic, but each instructor has such a different style its not boring.  They try to banter with each other, but it feels a little forced. Allie's segment is my favorite ,it has a Latin feel, but her cardio segment is on the short side since she also does the cool down.",1375228800,,439,4.152941176470589
3549322,2,B001EC6JE4,"I am a long time FIRMie and have enjoyed almost all of their DVDs-  but this one was a disappointment to me.  It was billed as beginner to advanced and normally that is true for the FIRM because you can bump up the weights and or intensity for the more seasoned exerciser.  I consider myself as intermediate-advanced and found myself bored with this workout- even the first time through.
The format is that each instructor leads a 7-8 min segment made up of their favorite moves.  I found the transitions a little rough- and all of the ""party"" references in their conversations are painfully contrived.
4 out of 5 instructors are very good at motivating you and cueing the exercises, but it is mostly low-impact and there are no weights used.  However, I will say that I am glad that I did make it through once-  the last segment is a fun dance-oriented lead by Allie- it just didn't get my heart rate up.
I think this would be a good workout for some who is very new to exercise and is looking for a low-impact workout.",1371772800,,1020,4.427807486631016
3549323,4,B001EC6JE4,This product is excellent for people who want to do a few minutes of exercise. I have tried others and do not work.,1367712000,,115,4.043478260869565
3549324,5,B001EC6JE4,I always enjoy The Firm videos.  This one has some tricky moves but overall it's still a good cardio workout.  Received my item in wonderful condition.  No issues.,1357084800,,163,4.75
3549325,5,B001EC6JE4,"This is a re-order for me. Like the workout and I recieved it fast, new and in good condition. it's part of my weekly work-out",1354233600,,126,4.08
3549326,5,B001EC6JE4,This video workout really gets your heart pumping.  Actually saw it on a monitor at my local Curve's where I am a member.  Had to have it for myself and do this workout at home.,1330041600,,177,4.0285714285714285
3549327,5,B001EC6JE4,"This is definitely my favorite workout DVD hands down! While it's not the most challenging cardio workout, it's definitely fun and you barely notice that 40 minutes have gone by. That being said, you will sweat but your heart rate won't be through the roof, which still makes it a great workout. I don't know about you but to me, the most important thing is enjoying the exercise because that's what will keep me motivated.",1303430400,3,423,4.653333333333333
3549328,4,B001EC6JE4,"I have long been a fan of ""The Firm"" workouts and this one will be in my workout rotation now too. I found some of the routines a little tricky to catch on to, but with some practice you can learn them. I really liked the rotation between the five instructors, which keeps the workout moving. It can be hard to find a program with no equipment, which is nice sometimes and this one certainly would be a worthwhile buy.",1297900800,,418,4.2375
3549329,4,B001EC6JE4,"I checked this out from the library and read the reviews before I tried it.  While there were some great reviews, the not-so-good reviews almost kept me from doing it.  I'm not very ""dance-y"" when it comes to my workouts.  I like Annie Lee's hi-def sculpt and Rebekah Sturkie' Get Chisel'd the most.  I'm pretty uncoordinated at choreographed dance-type things, especially when learning for the first time.

However!  I was pleasantly surprised to find myself keeping up.  Not perfectly, mind you.  My stamina is already good so the only things tripping me up were the new moves.  This dvd is obviously for someone who knows what sweeps, mambo-cha-chas, and quadstars are.  I haven't gotten the hang of it yet but I think after a few times doing it, I'll look like them (almost)!

I agree with everyone about Annie's segment.  I REALLY like her in hi def sculpt even though she is a little stiff and her cues aren't perfect.  But in Cardio Party she's kinda blah, and yes, awkward.  Other than that and loving the fact that I was home alone when I tried it (so no one could see me flail around), I'll be putting this one in my rotation.",1297814400,,1136,4.5594059405940595
3549330,5,B001EC6JE4,"This is one of my favorite Firm workouts. Lots of dancing; this workout is fun and a great workout. Lots of stomach work, too. Rebekah Sturkie and Allie both do a wonderful job with creative routines and good music. Allison is always creative in the new Firm videos and she helps carry the video, too. Emily's routine focuses on stomach trimdown and really hits those areas. Annie's moves are basic and get you moving; it was a good idea to put her routine in the middle of the video as it was a little repetitious.

I didn't want this video to end; it could have had one more set with Allie. I loved her Latin dance routine.",1297728000,,625,4.3418803418803416
3549331,5,B001EC6JE4,I absolutely love Cardio Party!  It is a lot of fun and fairly easy to pick up! After the third workout I felt extremely confident with the routines.  The workout is broken down into 5-8 minute sessions.  Each session is lead by a different instructor.  Each session is fun and energetic and doesn't feel monotonous!  The workout goes by very quickly because it isn't boring! I'll do this workout in the morning and want to do it again in the evening!  In the past I have bought other workout dvd's and have rarely viewed more than twice.  I have had the Firm Cardio Party for a month and have done it on average three times in a week and never tire of it!  I would definitely consider purchasing other Firm DVD's in the future!,1294963200,,728,4.380597014925373
3549332,4,B001EC6JE4,"I really like this workout, especially Emily's section. But she's one of my favorite Firm leads, so perhaps i'm biased! Allie's and Rebekah's part is also good--Alison's is ok, but it's a duplicate of a different workout.

Annie's section is a little slow and awkward. I tend to ""power up"" her section by adding plyometrics. It really is awkward though---I wonder why they didn't refilm that part and give her a second chance.

I would buy it again though. I use this workout probably once about every 2 weeks, though I add Emily's section to other workouts to make them longer.",1293667200,,578,4.712871287128713
3549333,4,B001EC6JE4,"I really enjoy the first three segments of the video, it's really fun and the moves are sequenced well.
The fourth segment slows down too much for my taste, and the last segment with the latin dancing takes a few workouts to get down.

I also modify by using weighted gloves for greater intensity.",1285372800,,297,4.5
3549334,2,B001EC6JE4,"I normally LOVE the Firm workouts.  I own many of the dvds.  However, I was disappointed with this particular workout.  Alison's routine was good, Allie, Emily and Rebecca's routines were well choreographed, but not challenging enough.  And Annie definately needs more practice/experience as an instructor.  She seems nice, but was very difficult to follow.",1284940800,,357,5.537037037037037
3549335,5,B001EC6JE4,I was very pleased with the shipper. My DVD was shipped fast and was in perfect condition.,1284422400,,90,4.352941176470588
3549336,1,B001EC6JE4,"Did not like this tape at all.  It was more like intro to a dance class, which is fine if that is what one is looking for but I have two left feet, and a messed up back; I just wanted to work out!  I wanted more of what the Body Sculpting System 2 had. Some of the moves were just awkward! I also didn't like the instructors asking dumb question to the others in the video and Allie didn't lead it as stated in the information.  Not for me.  I'll stick to system 2 with Allie and Emily! (Fast Shipping and DVD is good condition.)",1274054400,2,529,3.9622641509433962
3549337,4,B001EC6JE4,This is a great 40min cardio workout. Each instructor has thier own segment to keep things fresh and keep it going. They have fun moves that work your whole body. I love this for a quick workout at home.,1271203200,,203,4.230769230769231
3549338,4,B001EC6JE4,"I just finished this workout.  It was a lot of fun.  For me, what keeps me interested in a workout is trying to master the choreography.  I thought this one was fun.  I don't know if I'll do it again or not, but it was enjoyable.  I broke a sweat and got my heart rate up a little, so I got my cardio for the day.  If you want this workout to be a little higher impact, just add jumps and hops to the moves.  I didn't care for the latin dance at the end, I just felt silly shaking my chest side to side!",1271203200,,503,3.7333333333333334
3549339,5,B001EC6JE4,"I used to exercise daily, but since having my last child 3 months ago, I've just gotten back into the swing of things. Usually, I find The Firm DVD's challenging, yet doable without hitting pause. Not this one! This DVD kicked my butt the first time through! It took me 2 hours to get through 40 minutes of workout! It was very fun though, I enjoyed it, and I look forward to mastering the moves. I think it will keep my interest for awhile.",1266105600,,441,4.261904761904762
3549340,3,B001EC6JE4,"I'm an intermediate exerciser in decent shape- no marathoner but get my 5 days a week in.  I am sick so I did this DVD, and it didn't really get my heart pumping.  So it was nice and easy for the ""sick"" me, so i was exercising without pushing myself.  Even so, I ended up doing some squat jumps and push ups by myself so i didn't feel like i was completely not burning calories.  The last segment was fun because the lady (they trade off) did some cha cha but i am not a dancer so didn't really do it that well.  I bet I'll do better next time!",1265155200,,544,3.909090909090909
3549341,4,B001EC6JE4,"I have tried a few of the Firm Videos in the past and some I have liked and others weren't necessarily what I was looking for.  This one sounded different, and since I exercise daily, I'm always looking to try something that is out of the norm for me.  I do a variety of workouts (dance, pilates, yoga, cardio, step, kickboxing, etc) so a good cardio blast for a day when I am a bit short of time seemed just the ticket.

In this dvd you get five instructors who take turns over the 40 minute workout-each having a different style and different exercises.  There are squats, lunges, mambos, and cardio and pliometric exercises.  If you want low impact or have knee issues, do not do the jumping variations.  I see that it says a beginner can do this, and that is true, but they do move fast-there is no warm up to speak of or cool down.  I would recommend always stretching out a little before jumping into even a simple cardio routine in order to protect yourself and make sure you are warmed up.

My favorite instructor on this was Allie who comes on last and does her exercises with a Latin dance flair.  Her section was the most fun for me since I enjoy dance.  I do have to stop looking though at the instructor to the right of the screen, Annie, who appears to have more of a strength training background and doesn't exceptionally excel in the dance section of the dvd-she looks a tad uncomfortable with this section like she can't wait for it to be over.

I wore my pedometer while I did this video and logged in about 3800 steps.  Pretty good!  It definitely gets you moving, and it is a good way to start your day if you don't have time for an hour long workout.

I felt this was a good intermediate workout that was easy to follow if you dance or are used to lots of changes between moves. If you are a bit less coordinated, fear not, the exercises will be pretty easy once you have tried the video a few times.

Overall, a good video, with standard exercises, easy to follow that brings your heart rate up and gets the old blood pumping!",1264377600,5,2048,4.283116883116883
3549342,4,B001EC6JE4,"This is a great workout for a day off from the weights.  I am long-time fan of the FIRM and needed something fun and high energy without the weight-training element for my recovery days.  This is perfect--it was fun (though the segments were simply a re-filming of cardio routines from other videos)and moved quickly from instructor to instructor keep my interest high.  Annie Lee seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera, her segment was less sophisticated and awkward making it a bit of a drag to do--but the other four were quite fun!  I wish there had been more of a cool-down/stretch.  I can do my own cool-down, but for people who aren't familiar with cooling down on their own the lack of cool down/stretch is problematic and concerning.",1262217600,,747,4.75968992248062

I own mostly all of the newer firms, and yes, they did pull some moves from different videos but I didn't mind. I like the way each section is taught by a different lead, it made it move very quickly. My heart rate stayed up, and I had fun throughout. I do have to agree with some reviewers though that Annie just didn't seem to have it together.. her section, although the moves were ok, seemed uninspired and stiff. You get what you put into this video and can put more of a ""bounce"" to the movements to make it your own cardio workout. All in all, this one is a keeper for me...",1248220800,,684,4.036764705882353
3549345,3,B001EC6JE4,"I'm an intermediate exerciser, and I think this is better for light days.  A beginner might find it more of a cardio workout.  If you've worked out to other firm dvd's there will be no surprises here.  There are 5 ""firm masters"" that each take turns leading a segment.  The segments contain their ""favorite moves"" which are typical firm moves, like knee raises, grapevines, mombos, squats, etc.  I found the moves easy , but someone new to firm or dancing may have to rewind a few times to catch all the moves. I thought some of the leaders were better at cueing than others.  I can understand that they don't want to select music that can become dated, but it is boring.  If I kept the DVD, I would eventually turn off the volume and play my own stuff.  I took a star off because the cool down lasted for only about a minute. I just did my own stretches.

Although there are moments of intensity, it seems to keep my heartbeat right around the fat-burning level, which is just fine. The routines are fun and a good mix of styles. Not my favorite, but it did introduce me to a few different 'master instructors' that I might not have otherwise tried.  It is anchored by Allison Davies for the warm-up and first routine and Alli del Rio for the final routine and cool-down, with the three other instructors taking turns in between. I'm not sure why Rebecca Strukie's name is first/her picture is on the DVD; of the 5 instructors and routines, her routine was my least favorite (not that it was bad; it just wasn't great).
