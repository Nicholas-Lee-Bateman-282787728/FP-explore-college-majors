8636927,2,B00HWGWSCI,"This series of DVDs is a lecture series on Qigong.  It is not an instructional series.  If you want to learn the movements and cadence of Qigong, this is not what you need.  You will not see in-depth demonstration on Qigong with these DVDs.  If you are looking to learn, via lecture and some very brief demonstration (demonstration on only on two of 6 DVDs), then this is perhaps what you're after.",1420156800,17,398,4.486111111111111
8636928,5,B00HWGWSCI,"Each of the dvds in the 18 hour, 6-dvd collection ""Understanding Qigong"" is another masterpiece by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming!  The purpose of this work is to help the student understand Qigong, and each dvd effectively addresses a key aspect of the subject ""Qigong"" in a way that is truly educational and valuable for the student's understanding and development.  All of the information provided in each dvd is so important in developing a foundation upon which to build all future future Chi development and/or Martial Arts training. I would highly recommend that the interested student purchase the entire 6-dvd set for their own benefit.  The student will also find that these works are referenced as the source of ""further in-depth information"" in other of Dr. Yang's amazing works.  As in all areas of life, an effective and powerful end product requires an effective and powerful foundation upon which the end product is built.  This work by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming offers the student that foundation.",1418947200,13,999,5.104294478527607
8636929,5,B00HWGWSCI,"Dr. Yang is so personable yet truly is today's current authority on the subject, bringing precise ancient tradition and wisdom into the scientific modern light of educated scrutiny. I spent literally Thousands of dollars traveling to YMAA Headquarters in Boston, Jamaica Plain, to gain this information. And to see it all right there, ready to be shipped to your home,  from the comfort of your living room, it's just beyond delightful. The ease of which most will likely take for granted all of the knowledge that had been compiled into this set is beyond what most can truly comprehend, even after watching the entire set,  on their television. This is some serious deep stuff and Dr. Yang is able to help the serious student to grasp the WHY in how all this works, from a scientific, analytical  perspective. The mere fact that Dr. Yang has painstakingly preserved and compiled this ancient knowledge for this and now future generations is beyond what Amazon's 5 Star rating can give. But as the very least that can be given..  may you all enjoy and appreciate the wealth of the true essence of what is available to you here.",1412553600,14,1128,4.769230769230769
