8083196,1,B000B86N3O,"I'm a big fann of mockumentaries and spoofs.  This movie really let me down. It was not funny.  A very dry movie, full of dialogue and no humor.",1206316800,,144,4.107142857142857
8083197,5,B000B86N3O,"We stumbled across ""G-Sale"" at the Austin Public Library. We thought it was a documentary on garage sales and that it might be quirky. Although this is fiction it could very well be non-fiction as it mimics the behavior of many who attend garage sales. The actors were so believable. We found the quirkiness we were looking for. We had just watched one of Christopher Guests' films (Guffman) and found G-Sale far funnier, natural, and all around more amusing. The characters were all original. It was nice to see new faces instead of the same cast over and over again as in Guests' films (favorite being Best in Show). G-Sale is a film I definitely want to see again!

Looking forward to more films by the writer/director.",1199577600,,722,4.68503937007874
8083198,2,B000B86N3O,"I bought this movie because I really enjoy mockumentary movies. I was hoping for a Christopher Guest-type movie. This movie was supposed to be about the funny things that happen at garage sales. Instead, it was a series of ""talking-head"" scenes in which people display their odd personalities. If it were funny, I would have been okay with that. It was not. There were a couple funny scenes, but overall I would recommend you skip this movie.",1189296000,,442,4.753246753246753
8083199,5,B000B86N3O,"""G-Sale"" is a wonderful independent film in the spirit of the great Christopher Guest movies (""Best in Show,"" ""Waiting for Guffman,"" etc.) It lampoons the characters that take garage sales extremely seriously in Bogwood, Washington, ""The Garage Sale Capital of the United States,"" which presumably filled its historical niche by virtue of having the highest number of garages per capita of any city in the country.

The film showcases a particular sale (""it's not an estate sale..."") of retro junk by cranky retirees Doris and Clayton Fenwick in which all of the town's garage sale addicts stand in line for early admittance, the prize being an obscure 1960's board game ""Pot o' Gold,"" from the TV show of the same name. The competition is fierce, determined, and deceitful. My favorite participants in the fracas are Dick Nickerson, the retired leprechaun star of the show, and computer geek Ed LaSalle creator of the role-playing fantasy game ""Caves and Beasts."" While the entire cast is hysterical, these two were the most subtly amusing and quirkiest.

I expect to see more (hopefully more widely promoted) great films from Producers Jessi Badami and Randy Nargi in the future: after this one I will definitely seek out their work. This is a great film that deserves much more recognition that it has achieved, and I recommend it highly.",1183248000,,1341,5.00896860986547
8083200,5,B000B86N3O,"G-SALE is just packed with witty humor.  Like myself, you do not have to be a garage sale shopper to appreciate and enjoy the film.  I have watched the film several times and like it more each time I see it.  We purchased several copies to give as holiday presents as I know others will enjoy being entertained by an original, fresh and extremely funny film!",1133827200,3,358,4.393939393939394
8083201,5,B000B86N3O,"This movie really tickles my funny bone. Zany, tongue in cheek humor - charachters you don't meet on T.V. or the big screen.  Just simply great fun, even if you don't go to Garage Sales in Bogwood U.S.A.",1133740800,4,203,4.342105263157895
8083202,5,B000B86N3O,"I saw this film twice at the Sarasota Film Festival and have been waiting for this DVD version to come out.  This mocumentary is fitting alongside the Christopher Guest classics.  You don't have to be a garage sale nut or a collector to appreciate the clever dry humor is this flick, though it certainly can help.  Well worth seeing again and again and again.",1133136000,4,359,4.578125
8083203,5,B000B86N3O,"We love this film.  In the spirit of the best 'mock-u-mentaries', this movie is a side-splitter.  Nargi has assembled a script, cast and setting that is at once familiar and refreshing.  Anybody who has ever gone to the first garage sales of the season will recognize many of the players here.  These are our neighbors, the ones we see but have never really known.  There is humor, angst, tension, drive and action all smudged by Nargi's creatively smirky thumbprint and snappy style all his own.  G-Sale is a must see.  If you are a fan of independent films then this prize belongs on the top shelf, standing proudly next to 'Best of Show' and 'A Mighty Wind'. Buy it and get ready for a wild ride.",1132876800,2,699,4.5
8083204,5,B000B86N3O,"My husband and I saw this at the Seattle Film Festival and laughed through the entire sold out movie. Actually, the whole audience was in stitches. A great cast of talented actors that you've never seen before. Very clever, with lots of tongue in cheek humor. My only complaint is it ended too soon. How often can you say that about a movie? A great piece of independent filmmaking that won't disappoint.",1132876800,2,404,4.625
8083205,5,B000B86N3O,"I got a big kick out of this movie. Who hasn't been nudged aside by a garage sale fanatic wanting just the item you're reaching for? Besides being a subject people can relate to, the acting is well done and the characters believable. Lots of chuckles in this one. No wonder it has won awards!",1132617600,2,292,4.327272727272727
