7859079,4,6304029934,"In Finder Keepers, Lovers Weepers  Russ Meyer explores his take on the reasons for marital fidelity.. An adept player of bedroom chess, Paul (Paul Lockwood) is so busy ""humping every hooker as soon as she comes of age"" that he is oblivious to the fact that his brothel madam girlfriend Claire (Lavelle Roby) has hired two thugs to hold up the Sunset Strip cocktail/topless go-go bar which he owns, and his fed-up wife Kelly (Anne Chapman) is having an affair with the bartender at the club . As he so often does, Meyer takes this threadbare plot set-up and expands it out to feature length by throwing in lots of wild go-go dancing, sweaty men with the morals of a rattlesnake, tough macho dialogue and strong over-sexed women who are straight out of Meyer's X-rated comic book imagination.

Like many of his films from this era, Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers is a crime melodrama wrapped up in sexploitation trappings. This is one of Meyer's lesser known films but it is surprisingly good. In fact I'd perfer it to some of his more well known films. Meyer is not moralizing but he clearly seems to be indicating that evil doers will be punished for their sins and that unfaithful spouses may end up in very dire straights indeed. These ideas go back to his more gothic black and white films.

For what it is the acting and writing is quite good and this is a small film by Meyer that deserves a larger audience.",1337299200,,1414,4.5810276679841895
7859080,4,6304029934,"A filandering club-owner and his lusty, but distant, wife learn a hard lesson about the value of their marriage.  A minor, but solid offering from the Meyer canon.  Features superb photograpy, editing and a small cast of stunning ladies as usual.  In this reviewer's humble opinion, Anne Chapman may be the sexiest starlet Meyer ever worked with, and that's saying alot.",980121600,2,370,5.032786885245901
7859081,4,6304029934,"Finders Keepers is Russ Meyer's deliberation on the strength of a marriage as both spouses are tempted by others. Not as brilliantly enthralling as other Meyer classics,but excellent just the same.",947030400,3,197,5.387096774193548
