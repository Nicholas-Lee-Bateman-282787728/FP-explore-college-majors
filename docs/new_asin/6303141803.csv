7838705,4,6303141803,Gerald McRaney who is most known for his tough but basically good guy roles on TV plays the part of a real life serial killer who went on a murder spree across the US back in the 80s. Along the way he picks up a teenager who is not like his previous victims because she is tough and doesn't cave in to his bullying. At first the police aren't sure if she is an working with him or just a kidnap victim. Eventually he lets her go shortly before being killed by police as he is moving north to try and enter Canada. The really chilling part of this whole movie is just how convincingly McRaney portrays this sociopathic murderer. It is so different from his other roles it is very impressive how well he handles it.,1262131200,3,713,4.211678832116788
