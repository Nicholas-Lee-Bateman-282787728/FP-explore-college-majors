8249236,4,B00135HE5A,"I was actually required to buy this book for a Yogafit workshop.  I began reading it and although it was required, really enjoyed it.  I enjoy yoga for the physical aspects and the breathing techniques, not necessarily for the spiritual aspect that many instructors set forth.  This is ""gym yoga"" but better.  The illustrations and detailed instructions are easy to follow.  There are routines in the back that help you pick and choose depending on the desired outcome of the workout.  I recommend it for the beginner or anyone interested in learning more about yoga in general.",1329523200,,578,4.907216494845361
8249237,5,B00135HE5A,The DVD is very interactive with different lengths and sections of practice.  It is very powerful and the poses are held for good amount of time.  It also incorporates more in depth poses that most cheap videos don't.  I felt like I was in the classroom!,1281398400,,254,4.478260869565218
8249238,2,B00135HE5A,"I own quite a few yoga DVD's and usually find something that I like about each one, but this DVD is my least favorite out of all.  First, the music is too electro-pop and/or MTV type music.  It is so distracting that relaxation is out of the question.  Granted, the music is not loud, so you may not find it as distracting as I did, but I did not like it at all.
Second, the instructors start out cueing the moves and then just start moving through the flow with no verbal notifications at all.  You would have to watch and turn your head to know that they are coming out of downdog and into standing forward bend, etc..they could at least tell you to come out of a pose when you are facing away from the TV.
Third, I didn't like that Pilates terms and yoga terms were intermixed during the flows.
I did like the poses in the warmups and cooldowns and the instructors were able to do very advanced poses, which is why I gave it 2 stars.",1205971200,15,936,4.154696132596685
