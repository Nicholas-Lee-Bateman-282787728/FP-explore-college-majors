7734192,5,B01E9ONPO0,"If you want a badass true American action movie without the liberal Hollywood BS, then this is your movie! Directed by Mr. Tom Getty who clearly knows how to make an American action movie. Finally a movie that portrays a United States Marine in the correct light, as he should be! This is a nonstop action movie that will keep you guessing the whole way. Your adrenaline will be pumping throughout the movie!!! Can't say enough how this movie completely blew my expectations out of the water! It will make you feel damn proud to be an American!!!",1464912000,,546,4.581632653061225
7734193,4,B01E9ONPO0,"So just finished watching Rising Fear! Great movie, great cast! Tom Getty is a talented producer and actor. Over coming a small town. Shrine and working hard. The movies he has done so far have been great getting better each time. Excited for the next one!",1464825600,7,256,4.586956521739131
7734194,5,B01E9ONPO0,"I highly recommend if you are a fan of action movies. From the opening scene until the final cut this movie is full throttle. It is a fast paced adrenaline rush that delivers in full force. This movie gets high marks for a few reasons. The director did an amazing job working with limited resources and amateur actors to create a film that allows shots to look better than a number of big blockbuster movies and the acting to look top notch. His artistic vision and knowledge of film truly shines. The lead character is reminiscent of Jack Bauer, another reason I suggest this to any action fan. This movie also spared the unnecessary romantic love story that so many Hollywood executives seem to yearn for in their action films. However, the greatest reason I suggest this film is the story line. It is woven together so nicely and kept me guessing throughout is Taylor was indeed a hero or a traitor. Mr. Getty well done, I will anticipate the next work of art!",1464739200,,963,4.540229885057471
7734195,5,B01E9ONPO0,"This movie is the cultivation of over 4 years of hard work, ..of giving 100% of everything, creativity, mentally, physically, emotionally, educationally.  And after watching the final product, it absolutely shows.
This action thriller doesn't know a slow moment.  Despite being a low budget, independent film, the special effects rivial what you see in hollywood blockbusters.  Only this film is rooted and filmed in the directors hometown, with hometown love, hometown actors, hometown talent and hometown landmarks.  (Johnstown and Pittsburgh, PA.)
The relatively new talent of actors only adds the layer of realness to the movie.  The actors include people ranging from rising actors, to Veterans, to all around film enthusiants.
As the movie progresses, the fear and anticipation only rise, and the twists toward the end are shocking, yet satisfying.
I highly suggest giving this movie a try, but don't just rely on my review,  note that before the movie even was released, it won #1 action film at a film festival and has been steady in top #4 new releases on Amazon since its release less then a week ago.
Although this director and written, produced and acted in several other movies, the last being another multi award winner, this one is his best to date.",1464739200,,1264,5.052884615384615
7734196,5,B01E9ONPO0,"This is an outstanding movie!! It's amazing what this indie director did with the limited resources one has access to.

7734197,5,B01E9ONPO0,"You never know what you are going to get from an indie movie, especially an action movie, but RISING FEAR was an amazing thrill ride!  With only a $6,000 budget, you can see why it took years for Tom Getty to make this movie.  His vision as a director stood out the most as the movie was cut together like it was a Die Hard sequel.  But Tom also had some fun with the special effects and script as the movie builds from a one person manhunt and by the end it is the entire country!  Forget watching London has Fallen...you have seen that movie before...instead watch a rising star...watch Tom Getty's Rising Fear!.",1464652800,2,614,4.359649122807017
7734198,5,B01E9ONPO0,"Not my favorite movie by any means but you young, action fans will certainly enjoy it.  No scene (cut) seems to run longer than six seconds.  My attention span is a bit longer.  P.S.  I live in--and love--Pittsburgh.  That's why I bought the DVD.  Enjoy!",1475452800,,254,4.533333333333333

7734200,4,B01E9ONPO0,Good action but a little hard to follow at times.,1471651200,,49,4.0
7734201,4,B01E9ONPO0,"If this is the kind of movie you can make on a $6,000 budget, pretty much every major studio in Hollywood should be scared.  Although it was produced on a shoestring budget, ""Rising Fear"" (which struck me as a cross between ""The Fugitive"", ""Speed"" and ""Die Hard"") is surprisingly good.  The dialogue is believable, the actors are solid (not wooden or awkward) and the special effects (although not quite Hollywood-caliber) are very good, especially the computer effects (the shots showing satellite tracking, phone tracing, etc.).  I was consistently amazed at how much the director achieved without a big movie budget.  In my opinion, this movie pretty much sets the current state of the art for indie action movies.

As good as it is, it's not perfect: at times, it's hard to follow the dialogue spoken by the main villain, since he uses a voice changer (in my opinion, his lines should have been shorter).  Also, there are some sequences of stock footage that cut so quickly that it becomes almost overwhelming, like a bad MTV montage. Finally, the ultimate ending of the movie was solid but it was a bit confusing about how we got there.  I think the story arc could have been presented in a simpler fashion so you could focus on the action instead of scratching your head about why certain things were happening.

That being said, I give it a very solid four stars - if you want to see an amazing independent action film, you probably can't do better than ""Rising Fear"".",1471132800,4,1475,4.712062256809339
7734202,5,B01E9ONPO0,"What a fast paced movie. Keeps you on your seat the entire way through the film. This is a must see, to appreciate all that went into making it. We went to the Premiere tonight and highly recommend seeing this. What a heart beating thrill it was. Had to get the DVD to see it many times over.
My wife doesn't like these types of movies but she said she was glued to her seat and never took her eyes off the screen. She wanted to make sure we had our copy of the DVD to see again and again. That is a first for her.
This movie went above and beyond our expectations.",1469059200,,565,3.9649122807017543
7734203,5,B01E9ONPO0,"A slick, well-done action film, entertaining and thought-provoking. This is a unique indie project that feels like a major feature. Tom Getty as director and producer is smooth in his effects, suspenseful editing, and final treatment. Theres good acting by Getty himself, and especially by costars Curtis Caldwell, Kirsten Meenan, and the voicing of the villain by Philip Lewis. Spirited writing is evident, tight filming, captivating special effects, complicated plotting, and a classy heroic ending. The general viewer should really enjoy Rising Fear. For others I suggest obtaining this DVD of an early hit by Tom Getty, a dedicated auteur and polymath, whos going to create exceptional cinema. The awards are well-earned!",1468972800,,725,5.482142857142857

7734208,4,B01E9ONPO0,"I had seen Tom's ""Emulation,"" so I was really looking forward to this film.  I was not disappointed.

Judging Rising Fear as an independent studio production, it's right up there with some very good theatrical releases. The plot, though a bit convoluted, is not just another action film with not just another terrorist villain.  There are deeper, interesting motives behind the major characters, and the acting and direction make them believable.  The tension starts right in at the beginning (who IS that girl and why is she suddenly interested in this guy?), and doesn't let up through the whole film.

There is occasional humor from situations, more than, say, outright jokes.  This adds to the impression that this film was well written and produced by an experienced team.

BUT WAIT!  Except for acting, camera help and a few other chores, Acrolight is a ONE MAN STUDIO!  It's actually a little funny to see such things as ""Orchestra Conducted by Tom Getty"" and ""Recorded at the Acrolight Amplhitheater [sic].""  Mr. Getty is loaded with talent and energy. He didn't give screen credit, but he was in excellent ""hero"" shape, so kudos to his trainer.  Well, it was probably himself.

A few things prevent me from giving this five stars, but I still highly recommend the film:  Some of the acting was amateur, there were lots of misspellings on signs, computer screens and even the end credits, and a VERY careful scrutiny will find a few flaws in the CGI.

On the plusside, LOTS of the effects were wonderfully believable, including an Apache helicopter in a chase scene... in downtown Pittsburgh. Given the total Pittsburgh flavor (even the President has a regional accent), I should say ""dahntahn Pisburgh.""

It's a great ride, Getty is a fine protagonist, being capable, feisty, deep and a sympathetic tinge of sadness in his manner. Endings, to me, can make or break a film; this one fit nicely and plucked my heart strings, too.

As a former resident of the area, and native of the ""tahn"" in which much of the shooting took place, Johnstown, Pa,  I especially enjoyed seeing some familiar places. Any fan of Getty's previous films will recognize key actors, too, including the President and the Femme Fatale, Oskana.

Overall, it's a solid Four Stars.  Given that I'm picky, you might give it Five!",1467158400,,2306,4.866666666666666
7734209,5,B01E9ONPO0,"I LOVED Rising Fear! It really held my attention. I'm so impressed that Tom was able to produce a movie of this quality on his own, here in Johnstown and Pittsburgh, as well as act as the main character! Tom did a great job acting! It was very believable. I enjoyed the story line! It flowed really well with a suspenseful ending. The actors were great! It was so fun seeing places I've been to shown in the video and seeing all the people I know as actors in this movie. They all did a great job! The voice of the terrorist was creepy and that he had to wear this mask made him even more creepy. The background music was a perfect mix for what was happening on the screen.  Excellent Job, Tom!!  I look forward to more movies, Tom Getty!!",1466467200,,739,4.197183098591549

7734214,4,B01E9ONPO0,"I have eagerly been waiting for the release of Rising Fear after watching Emulation a few years ago. This film shows incredible progress on Tom Gettys  acting, music scoring, directorial, and screen writing abilities. The story introduces its protagonist Ryan Tyler played by Tom Getty as a quiet everyday American until he is unwittingly framed and held responsible for an act of terrorism. Now a wanted man by several government agencies his past begins to come into focus and with it shadow players are exposed. Rising fear does an incredible job of producing big budget action within an independent film.",1465776000,,608,5.08
7734215,5,B01E9ONPO0,"Just finished watching Rising Fear. Absolutely great film. Being from the same town as Tom makes it even greater. Great plot, good cast, and awesome to see my small town on the big screen. Highly recommend to check this out.",1465603200,,224,4.625
7734216,5,B01E9ONPO0,"Made in his hometown of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Rising Fear is the second Independent film by Tom Getty. On a shoestring, a very short one, he not only wrote the screenplay, he directed, produced, edited,composed the music and starred in it!  He did it all with help from friends, family and hundreds of volunteers. This action film is non-stop, the plot, entirely plausible. Getty has acting chops and he's going to put his name and his hometown back on the map. The movie industry needs more young independent film makers like Getty, to make good, exciting films, in out of the way locales, on small budgets. The current state of the film industry is the bigger, the costlier, the better. To this I say, You go Tom Getty, and keep up the good work. I loved your film and can't wait for the next one!",1465516800,11,802,4.569444444444445

7734218,5,B01E9ONPO0,"If Tom Getty told me he was making Medellin I would buy a ticket to an advance screening knowing full well it would be a sure fire HIT. This guy is just gold because of his dedication to every detail. Rising Fear is a great step forward from his Emulation beginnings. Fear has a great pace to it, a spine tingling intensity at times and has a plot with just the right amount of twists to open up the thoughtful themes and undertones of the script. It is Nolan-esque in the way it makes you ask yourself ""what if"" after it ends. It is a great modern thriller and the fact that he did nearly EVERYTHING himself (especially the special effects, those are crazy hard to make look good) says one thing: This guy is going places!",1465516800,3,723,4.2846715328467155

7734229,4,B01E9ONPO0,"Making movies isn't easy. Nor should it be. If they were, everyone and their mother would be crafting Spielberg-like quality pictures, or maybe not...Anything's possible. It's clear with every moment, time and incredible amount of hard work went into this picture. Coming out of one individual, it's clear he has talent, and with more time his ability to tell stories will only grow.

 This flick is not without its flaws, there are plot holes that for a film fan can be annoying, but you have to focus on the bigger picture, letting the small things weight you down will ruin your viewing experience, I'm not saying this for just this movie, but all motion pictures.
At times, the effects don't add up and can take you out of the scene, but that only lasts a minute. You've become so engaged in the action taking place, that everything else doesn't matter.
The only true issue in this movie was the supporting acting, mostly from those who are clearly not actors and possibly never had the desire to follow that path. At times, the performances come off laughable. But, you must give them credit for trying. Even the cheesy moments with these people made the story just that more fun.

The story is simple and could be done by any filmmaker, but it's not what happens in the story that counts, but how it's delivered that matters. Each scene, Tom Getty uses all his abilities to transport us into his world, this alone is admirable. Intercutting his own footage with those from around the world, Getty gives his story a grander look and scale. There is a quick flashback halfway through the movie that for me, made the entire 96 minutes even better. It felt like Zero Dark Thirty and Batman Begins all in one. If that what Getty was going for, bravo to you, sir.

This is an action movie, and with that comes specific elements you have to included, the evil villain with a plan more than it seems (i.e. Die Hard 3) a supporting hero who just wants to do what's right (i.e. Dark Knight Rises) people will complain, that's unoriginal, but in fact it's necessary, where's the fun in watching a save-the-day story, if those pieces aren't involved. They have been engrained in our story telling, like everything in this movie, it's not what they are, it's how they're used. And Mr. Getty used them perfectly.
Sure, our hero never takes a moment to react to what he's been going through or how does it all make him feel, as most heroes do, but who cares really. The point of this story is to find and stop the bad guy, pure and direct. With a tale like this, you don't need a moment to let us know he's still human and he cares. Stop the bad guy, that's your mission.

The purpose of a movie is entertainment. Help your audience escape from their everyday world. Stories like Rising Fear remind us that it's okay to get lost in a story, to embrace the insane knowing fully well, it's all for fun.",1464998400,3,2891,4.520076481835564

7734234,1,B01E9ONPO0,"Mad Max, Halloween, Clerks, Napoleon Dynamite. All wildly successful low budget films. The film Rising Fear sadly shares nothing with the aforementioned films except for the low budget moniker. This movie is a dud in every way imaginable.

Being a Johnstown native and resident myself, I wanted the film to have some sort of redeemable or plucky quality to it. I wanted upstart movie maker Tom Getty to excel somewhere. For 96 minutes I hoped and searched but in the end was left wanting. Let's break it down shall we?

Plot:
The beginning hook is excellent, getting someone to detonate a bomb for you by having an attractive girl give them a fake number to call, pretty creative. From there however, it all goes down hill. The script does little to involve in you in any of the characters due to the lack of depth or development. Nor does it lead you to believe that any of the events are even remotely plausible. The holes are frequent and jarring. The holes and leaps in logic do seem like the could have easily been avoided with some proofreading.

Acting:
A low budget film can be expected to be filled with amateurs, friends and family wanting to help the people responsible out. This is no exception, and so they get a pass. There are three characters however who mainly drive the story. Of those three, two seem motivated while the other shows no emotion whatsoever. Sadly the latter is not the one who wears a mask. The film's main protagonist should be running the gamut of emotion throughout the movie, but none of this is displayed. Instead we're supposed to root for someone who looks as though he has yet to have his morning coffee. The Special Agent however does his absolute best with the material he was given. A Best Supporting Actor nod to you sir. Our masked baddie even is able to convey more with just his eyes than just about everyone else in the film.

Cinematography:
Two words; quick cuts. I didn't keep track, but the cuts for this film were so quick and frequent it soon became difficult to tell who was with whom and where exactly they were. It also didn't help that a majority of the dialog is delivered in close up shots of the actors delivering them. Very rarely do two actors share the same shot and it shows. The ""say a line, cut to response, cut again etc."" format kills any chance of character interaction or development. The low budget nature of the film is surely to blame for the lack of framing shots and set pieces, and the lack of reference quickly made the film feel disjointed. The focus blurs the background for each shot and makes it seem as if all the people are in the same room together. Again we can also blame the low budget for the lack of any sort of semblance of chase footage.

Music:
Repetitive, but also available for purchase.

In conclusion:
I gave this film one star simply because I had to. Because that's what it deserves. I wasn't even going to write a review until I saw that it was rated 4.8 at the time of this posting. Now I'm sure that Mr. Getty has many friends who would like to see him succeed and that this review is going to get marked as ""unhelpful"" straightaway. But how can anyone improve if you shower them in false praise when mediocrity is the product? Do not promote this film, and to tell the makers that it is ""great"" or ""awesome"" is doing a great disservice to them and the art that they could produce one day with the correct criticism.

The original draft of this review was a straight up lampoon, but then after careful consideration I decided to remove the snark and simply be honest and point out the pitfalls where they were identified.

Action movies are serious undertakings, and I have no doubt that this was a labor of love for all those involved, but all things considered this movie was simply not ""good"".",1464912000,18,3800,4.4971014492753625

7734236,5,B01E9ONPO0,"First things first, I have to mention that I was afforded the opportunity to be an extra in the ground zero scene, so my review is coming from a place of excitement and high expectations for the movie.  That was about three to four years ago. Finally after all of waiting, I watched it last night.

My initial reaction afterward? Wow! The story was incredible and the overall quality and effects look like it could have cost MULTIPLE times what it did. This is a credit to Tom's precision and tireless efforts to make the movie perfect regardless of the time it took. I admire that in a world today where movies and virtually everything seems to be rushed to meet deadlines while quality is sacrificed. It was also amazing to see such a well produced movie shot largely in my hometown, although those not from Johnstown that view the movie won't experience that sort of thrill!

From start to finish, the action never stops. I thought it was interesting how the main characters were developed throughout the movie in the midst of the action, as opposed to it slowing down and speeding up to accomplish it. For me personally, I will need to watch it more times to continue to pick up the little details I may have missed the first time, but this is something I will NOT have a problem with!

As for the plot itself, terrorism is something that almost everyone in America can relate to. For those old enough to remember how we felt on September 11th, it really hits home and brings about those same feelings of fear and uncertainty. Even today, we still live in that world, so the timing of a movie such as Rising Fear is perfect.

Overall, I highly recommend the movie. I have no doubt that it will catch fire around the world as more and more people discover and watch it. Great job Mr. Getty!!",1464912000,,1794,4.474006116207951

At first I thought the story line was old and tired, but it had a nice twist at the end that made it more interesting.  We watched with a group of friends and we all enjoyed it!",1501545600,,315,3.742424242424242

8758220,2,B01E9ONPO0,"Ryan Taylor (Tom Getty) former Marine special ops gets tricked into dialing a phone number that blows up a building in Pittsburgh because they give tax breaks for filming there. He is captured and the truth doesn't work so he escapes from the CIA? and is on a quest to save the President and Pittsburgh from an Al Qaeda Darth Vader looking bad guy from Chechnya who spouts corny recycled lines from a Uwe Boll film. This is all the while avoiding CG rockets launched from helicopters in downtown Pittsburgh. Cool, if you're 12.

The film lacked character build up and the necessary love story in lieu of a slightly twisty plot that wasn't that good. Didn't really care if Ryan Taylor lived or died. There was nothing special about him.

8758221,5,B01E9ONPO0,"We bought Rising Fear after reading about it in an independent filmmaker magazine.  We were intrigued to see what could be done with a $6,000 budget, and while certainly not perfect, Tom and his supporting team have done a really admirable job.  The cable channels and VOD outlets are full of much less compelling movies made with much larger budgets.  Is it rough around the edges?  Sure, even rough towards the center in a few places, but it's better than you would expect given the meager resources at Getty's disposal.  If you're going to compare this movie to a Hollywood action blockbuster, you'll be disappointed, but you'll also be missing the point. Think of it as watching a minor league baseball game.  The talent might be raw, but the potential is there.

Perhaps the most compelling takeaway is that you don't have to rely on the approval of anyone. Don't like what's coming from Hollywood?  Studios don't understand your vision?  Take matters into your own hands!  It's possible to create something respectable if you're willing put the effort in.

We're hoping that this will be a stepping stone for Tom Getty's career.  We'd like to see what he could accomplish with a $25,000 budget!  Tom, crowdfund the next one, and we'll pitch in!",1485907200,,1250,4.812206572769953

8758223,3,B01E9ONPO0,Absorbing tale of ex marine who gets lured into a terrorist's plan to wreak havoc in the USA.  Action picture moves quickly through hyperkinetic scenes.  The music adds to the suspense and the special effects are decent.  Main terrorist's dialogue is hard to understand (but understandable knowing his devastating facial injuries).  Definitely entertaining for the genre!,1477267200,,371,5.571428571428571
