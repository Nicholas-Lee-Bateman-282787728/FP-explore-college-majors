8296329,5,B001E50RUS,"Though not mentioned on air, this show was taped on Nancy Reagan's 46th birthday, but I digress...  It is fascinating to see how many problems of today were already being faced in 1967: California as the most progressive State in the country, taxes that were the highest in the nation, welfare rolls that were too large, more population influx (into California) than could be absorbed into the economy.  The issue of States rights versus Federal control is also at the forefront; thus, the question of whether it was possible to be a good Governor if each State in the Union was only a local subsidiary of the Federal government. Nearly half a century later, we know how it turned out.",1452988800,,685,4.7
8296330,5,B001E50RUS,"Great interview with William F Buckley on Firing Line, early in Reagan's political career, very practical comments by Reagan. Too bad we don't seem to have that currently.",1389139200,,171,5.142857142857143
8296331,5,B001E50RUS,"Mannered but direct, the civil William F. Buckley interviews some of the most important people of the 20th Century. His style is laid back and pleasant, but his questions are on point. His interview of then-Governor Ronald Reagan is not to be missed. Buckley, an intellectual conservative, is as hard on other conservatives as he is on liberals. Not to be missed, if only to see how people should behave.",1388793600,,404,4.785714285714286
8296332,4,B001E50RUS,"I am grateful to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University for maintaining and releasing these episodes of WFB's Firing Line.  There are some quality issues, due to the nature of the decades old archival video tapes, as well as the a/v technology in use at the time.  However, the opportunity to witness these discussions is well worth my time and money.  I especially enjoyed this episode with the newly-elected Governor Ronald Reagan.  Reagan is often billed as a great communicator, which can be a compliment or an insult depending upon the tone used.  Detractors maintain he was nothing without a rehearsed speech, an actor whose strings were being pulled by the minions around him.  His Firing Line appearances argue well against this characterization.  RR comes off as informed, thoughtful, logical, and seems to think on his feet pretty darn well.  While WFB was admittedly a fan of Reagan's, this is not Tiger Beat.  These men are having deep discussions of relevant issues of the time.  I highly recommend this DVD, as well as the Firing Line debate on the Panama Canal Treaty, featuring WFB against Reagan.  The supporting cast features George Will, Pat Buchanan, Admiral John McCain Sr., and a couple of other gentlemen whose names escape me.  WFB is always interesting, and it can be fun just to watch him think.  He truly seemed to enjoy Firing Line,  It's a shame we don't have anything comparable today.",1252713600,15,1422,4.920168067226891
