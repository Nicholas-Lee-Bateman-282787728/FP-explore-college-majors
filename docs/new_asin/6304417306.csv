7870951,5,6304417306,"""What's the story Wishbone?"" Wishbone is a dog that loves classic literature and has a big imagination.  In each episode there is a story in Oakdale with Joe Talbot and his friends and of course his dog Wishbone. And then in the other part of the episode Wishbone plays the roles of different characters in the books he reads. He acts like the character but makes the role he plays in the episodes very funny with his Wishbone style humor.

This was the first episode of Wishbone and the story is about Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn always looking for adventure and getting into some trouble when they try to find some. In the other story in this episode Joe and his friends back in Oakdale want to go to the No Name Grave for some excitement because summer is almost over only to find someone digging up the grave!

The cast and crew do a good job at making classic literature fun for kids, and it made me want to check out a few books at my library that I would have never read if it weren't for Wishbone. So get these tapes because they are fun to watch and they get you in the mood to read the books they show in the episode, and if Wishbone can get you to read classic literature, you can read anything! :)",1242950400,,1213,4.242424242424242

This episode tells the story of Tom Sawyer while the parallel story is a mystery about a grave in Oakdale.  It's a good plot as usual and both children and adults can enjoy it.

The only problem I have is with the unnecessary political correctness that was so popular at the time the show was made.  For some reason the creators felt the need to change the character of Injun Joe into someone called Crazy Joe.  I guess they were afraid to offend any Indians.  But, of course, they didn't seem to mind offending crazy people.",1111795200,5,641,4.389830508474576
