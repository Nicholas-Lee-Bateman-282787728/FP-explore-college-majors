  A good show to watch and get your mind off the serious issues of the day.",1457222400,,164,4.09375
8458927,3,B0055YU3DU,"I have seen all of the Polish Dub for this series, about 10% of the Brazil Portuguese Dub -- and bits of the Italian Dub ... and considering how terrible the originating book is (in the American Cultural Imperialism aspect) that was used to create this series in the 1st place : a very good save indeed. IF YOU HAVE SEEN ""Genie in the House"" -- it is about 80% functionally similar.",1451952000,,382,4.319444444444445
8458928,5,B0055YU3DU,"I love this show. It is funny and family friendly.

They should have more shows like this in the US.",1389398400,,100,4.0
8458929,5,B0055YU3DU,"Wingin it is a really good show, that is good for people of all ages, mostly kids/teens. I Would recommend.",1386547200,,107,4.4
8458930,4,B0055YU3DU,"It nice to be able to get away from the crude humor that passes as comedy these today and have a show that suitable for all ages.  When I learn this show I first caught on STARZ network was on DVD I just had to get it. The only problem with series season one is the annoying angel puppet Dennis that gets replace later in seasons 2 and 3.

Its a simple plot about angel Porter is given the job to make his assignment Carl popular (something that eventually takes him 3 seasons to do)  with his mess up angel magic and the help of his superior angel posing as the school guidance councilor. If you're a fan of shows like Bewitched, I Dream of Jeanie, or Saved By the Bell you'll like this series.

Unlike Season 2 Part 1 release you'll be happy to have complete first season in this here set which you can watch in either English or try in French.",1384128000,,846,4.140243902439025
8458931,5,B0055YU3DU,"OK, it's a silly premise--a guardian angel tries to help a high school student become popular.  On the plus side, this is a family friendly show--no violence, language, or sensuality.  Things improve in Season 2 when they get rid of the annoying raccoon.",1364342400,2,254,4.883720930232558
