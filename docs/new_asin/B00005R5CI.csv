7951684,3,B00005R5CI,"""Secrets of the Dead"" is one of my favorite PBS shows.  Despite the lurid, almost silly show title (I still inwardly wince whenever I hear it), it regularly presents solid explorations of historical events using sound historical and archaeological research and, where possible, hard scientific analysis of new evidence.  This is NOT another ""In Search Of"" clone, like one of those shows asking leading questions and trying to imply the kind of weird or supernatural answers long embraced by antiquarians but long rejected by historians who follow more strict rules of evidence.

(Not that such shows are completely without merit.  They can be really entertaining and fun, like ""In Search Of"" was, so long as the viewer remembers not to place any credence in the ""mystery"" they are pushing.)

The reason I've written such a lot about what the show (in general) is NOT is because this particular episode, ""The Syphilis Enigma,"" is an odd one.  It aired in the show's second season, and feels like the producers were still trying to figure out what kind of show they were putting together:  Are they trying to lure viewers with a scary movie veneer to help them swallow the ""pill"" of science, or are they going to play it (mostly) straight throughout?  This episode goes for the spookiness, and in the process demonstrates why it was probably a good thing that the producers decided the show should go the other way from then on.

The questions the episode explores are very interesting, for historical as well as historiographical reasons: Did syphilis really evolve in the Americas and not come to Europe until after Columbus?  If not, why would historians think it did?  Why wasn't it mentioned in European medicine until the 16th century?  And what about that medieval graveyard in England...?""

However, there were also far too many quick cuts to pictures of the effects of syphilis backed up by vocal sound effects and spooky music.  Third-stage syphilis is horrifying enough; the film's editor did not need to rely on such heavy-handed tricks.  Even if you like actual horror movies, these were just badly done - too distracting and the contrast with calm discussions of the archaeology was jarring.

The science, the history, and the archaeology were extremely interesting, so normally I would have given this episode 4 or 5 stars; if you can ignore the ""Ooooo-scary!"" nonsense I would enthusiastically recommend it.  As it is, I'm still giving it 3 stars, because the underlying writing (narration and interviews) was, to me at least, very good.",1315440000,,2551,4.964705882352941
