8277821,1,B001713E4A,"The ever tendentious and propagandistic Robert Sirico could get his mind around denying his own kind their basic human rights, but cannot stretch to consider that the numerous encyclicals of his own faith about helping the poor might have some over-arching political character. In response to the appearance of the current Republican Speaker of the House at a Catholic commencement ceremony, which occasioned an epistolary rebuke from some academicians, he is sticking to his defense of a Catholic version of Atlas Shrugged. Whatever the cinematic virtues that a movie like this conceivably might have, for anyone to know that a mind some benumbed to basic intellectual sense and human decency, like Sirico's,  is behind it should make it only approachable with extreme caution and revulsion. Let the world be safe for entrepreneurs, but also safe from Ayn Rand with an M. Div. and an attitude. For that is all that is there.",1305158400,,925,5.0855263157894735

8277824,5,B001713E4A,"What do a farmer from rural Michigan, a merchant banker from Wall Street, and a retail & media magnate from China have in common?  Well, to begin with, they've each made a ton of money and are highly successful in their respective fields.

Brad Morgan is a dairy farmer from Evart, Michigan who initially struggles to keep his farm afloat, but through creativity, persistence, and a slavish devotion to quality, ends up owning a million-dollar dairy and compost company.

Frank Hanna is a merchant banker from New York City who has made it possible for countless entrepreneurs to finance their dreams.  Mr. Hanna explains how financial engineering not only makes credit more widely available to entrepreneurs today, but also played a crucial role in the discovery of America. According to Mr. Hanna, people need to realize that business is not a zero-sum game, where one person always wins and another always loses.  By spreading the risk of new ventures among numerous people, capital can be freed up to be used by all to create more wealth. I have to say that Hanna's statements might have rung more true prior to the recent meltdown in the U.S. economy.

Jimmy Lai's journey began in Mao's China when his family was split up so his parents could work on collective farms. To survive, Mr. Lai was forced to work as a baggage carrier in the railway station from the age of 9. At 12, he moved to Hong Kong on his own and began a career that led him to create Giordano, one of the largest retail businesses in China.  After Tianenmen Square, Mr. Lai was forced by the government to sell his share in the company, and  went on to become a media mogul, creating Next Magazine and several other publications.

The refreshing stories of these three diverse and highly successful entrepreneurs help to derail the commonly-held notion that entrepreneurial activity is the root of all evil.  The documentary accurately notes that many entrepreneurs are fueled by much deeper and higher motivations than greed and self-interest.  In fact, most entrepreneurs seem to be wired to use their creative talents to make the world a better place for others.

Making money does not begin to explain the entrepreneur's willingness to put up with huge personal risks and discomforts in order to actualize their vision.  They do so because they are responding to The Call.  They feel led by a force larger than themselves to see what isn't yet there, and move towards it.  Faith is essential to business.  As Jimmy Lai so aptly puts it, by their very nature entrepreneurs repeatedly ""dash into hope"" as they respond daily to The Call.

The film outlines four characteristics that set the entrepreneur apart from the average person.  The first is a creative spirit - the drive to create something out of nothing, and generate the new from the old. The second is the ability to recognize unrealized opportunities where others may see only dangers and threats.  The third is the ability to notice the needs of others and be willing to respond to them.  And finally, just as conductor helps to generate beautiful music from the diverse talents of many musicians, the entrepreneur needs the ability to harmonize the creative talents of other people toward a greater goal.

The point of view of entrepreneurism as call is informed and fleshed out by information from experts in the field of economics and theology, including Rev. Robert Sirico, founder and President of the Acton Institute which sponsored the film, Dr. Samuel Gregg, Dr. Jay Richards, George Gilder, and Michael Novak.

This is an excellent, well-crafted film that thoughtfully explores the deep connection between entrepreneurism, creativity, and spirituality.  I would highly recommend it.
