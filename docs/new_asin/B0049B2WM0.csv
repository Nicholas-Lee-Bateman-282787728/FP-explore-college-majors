8418933,1,B0049B2WM0,"Someone is killing off the girls who take it off live on webcam for a sexual fantasy site.

Who knew that you a movie about sex workers could be this boring? And unsexy!

Things aren't helped by bargain basement sets and continuity errors that are more entertaining than the movie itself.

The LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK-worthy title doesn't help things much either.

8418934,1,B0049B2WM0,"The filmmakers fail on all counts! Bad acting, camera work, editing, sound, story... there is nothing acceptable about this film. I have been watching a lot of independent films lately but this is the worst I have seen. Kitty Duncan isn't really an actress, she is a porno girl and her acting here shows that she belongs in that industry and not horror movies. I saw her under a different name doing fetish porn, I believe Izzy Sinclair was the alias. Actually most of these actors are in porn now or used to be. However, they forgot to take their clothes off in this disaster.",1355616000,,577,4.504761904761905
8418935,5,B0049B2WM0,"If you do enjoy the horror underground, and enjoy low budget flicks, this one should be quite enjoyable. It has the look of a modern horror film, it's not too long or complex. It's just a fun flick to watch. Oh yeah...and the beauties in the film don't hurt either. Kitsie Duncan is wonderful and the girl at the beginning is just gorgeous.

I do enjoy the burst of horror films from the underground. Believe it or not, it's more diverse than you think. This one has all the elements of a great underground horror film. Ms. Duncan can be a new horror star. I would love to see her next project. Overall, worth the price if you enjoy this genre...",1338595200,2,646,4.338842975206612
8418936,5,B0049B2WM0,"well, it has been a while since i have really been impressed with a newcomer in film, weather behind the camera or in front of the camera, well, in this teriffic, throw back to the old horror movies, and grindhouse movies, of the 70's, i have seen both, chris jay, the director, has a good eye, and a good hand at directing, and in front of the camera, kitsie duncan is a star! she could be the next angelia bettis! this is a knock out debuet! and a movie, if you love indie horror, or just good ol fashioned scary movies, you will love this movie!

  the movie is about girls who are killed while they are trying to act sexy, for the internet, and kitsie, plays the boss named elizabeth walsh, miss walsh is not a uh very good person all she cares about is profit, and when the girls start dying, business starts going up! so naturaly the police think it is her, well it could be???? but wait, there are 2 roomates, and one just got over a bad relationship, police also think he might be the killer! is he? or is it someone who we don't know in the film??

  the characters are well played in the movie, especially by kitsie, who really hams it up as miss walsh! she has a really good screne presents! and could be a really big star! and the rest of the cast is game too brad mills who plays the main detective is having a blast! and so is kevin stitch who plays his partner! this is a throw back to the grindhouse days, of overacting, but in a good way! it makes you laugh, while the movie gets ready for the next big shock, and believe me, there is a lot of that in the movie! it might be low budget, but that does not mean that there are not good scares, in the movie! you will be taken by surprise, and the killer's identity just might surprise you, it did me! and i am good at figuring movies out!

  in the end, what this movie is really about is just good ol fashioned scares, with some really fun, and campy comedy, and acting, if you like the 70's and 80's horror like jason, and other fun slashers, you might just really find a nice surprise with this wonderul gem! lethal obession, is a hell of a lot better than the big hollywood movies, it is original, and fun, and it has a star making performance! by kitsie duncan! and good directing by chris jay, and the script hits the right note of camp, and scares, watch it, you just might find out, that there is more to movies than just hollywood!",1298332800,2,2405,4.165948275862069
8418937,5,B0049B2WM0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I was quickly pulled into the story.  There are some really great new actors in this film, too.  It reminds me of the sexy horror films I grew up watching on late nite cable television, with lots of blood and gore, and also lots of sexy women to help balance it out.  This is definitely going to be a must watch every Halloween.  Classic film!",1289779200,3,413,4.125
