2697074,3,B000KRNMQ2,"I found the workouts worthwhile and the variety boredom busting, but the idea of splitting your workout into mini workouts through the day was a failure for me. With a two year old at home, doing an hour long workout at home seemed out of the question. I liked the idea of doing mini workouts through the day. But I sweat pretty good after each 10 minute session. Unless I want to take 3-5 showers a day, this just doesn't work for me. FYI - I am not over weight and I'm in moderate shape - not the best I've been but not the worst either. I guess i will just have to find the time to get my sweat on once a day followed by a shower.",1352073600,,633,3.953125
2697075,5,B000KRNMQ2,"This is such a good workout.  Ten-minute segments, so you can ""squeeze in"" a quick workout if you don't have a lot of time.  I enjoy it so much, I usually end up going from one to the next because I don't want to stop!  You will work up a sweat.  I really like this particular instructor too; I've had several of her videos.",1345507200,,324,4.015625
2697076,5,B000KRNMQ2,"This may seem superficial but I love this video first because the instructor is modestly dressed. I don't like the skinny b's flaunting all their goods.. abs all exposed, boobs pouring out.. sorry that doesn't motivate me. This woman is obviously fit but doesn't need to flaunt it to me. Makes me feel like she's human and not manufactured :) On a fitness perspective, this is probably my favorite. The exercises don't kill me but are still very challenging. I break a serious sweat during each segment.  I love that there are the 10 minute segments. Gives me a break if needed but also keeps the routine from being monotonous and its great that each segment gets a little more challenging.",1344902400,,690,4.702479338842975
2697077,5,B000KRNMQ2,"I love this workout, last year I was trying to lose some weight I had found various exercises on netflix but I didn't like any except this one I fell in love with it. I even had my four children working out with me. I weighed 233lbs went down to 185lbs and also eating right. I decided to look for this video on Amazon.com I couldn't beat the price and canceled my netflix membership it didn't make any since to keep paying $7.99 every month to only watch this. The video is fast paced but its good for beginners heck I was!",1331078400,,524,4.147058823529412
2697078,5,B000KRNMQ2,"This workout is perfect for those who want an intense, efficient workout and are short on time and space. It requires only a yoga mat and hand weights which keeps it nice and simple, the way a workout should be.  In today's fast-paced world, it is hard to find time and space for a workout.  This one leaves you NO EXCUSES! YEAY!! Andrea, the instructor, is a spritely little woman whose body inspires me: she's lean and toned and her voice (as another reviewer said) is not annoying.  After doing workout number one, I felt energized and ready to start my day.  It also left me wanting more!  The moves are just perfect. I can't wait to do all the workouts in succession. This is my first day at it so I will post results as I go along.  My goal is to strengthen and tone this 50-something body, improve cardiovascular health and as a bonus, fit into my size 3 jeans again and lose my ""hip pones"" and little pooch.  Will update my review if and when this happens.",1324944000,,964,4.322222222222222
8158906,5,B000KRNMQ2,"I like this video a lot because the instructor makes working out very fun. I like the choice of music and combination of workouts.  I like the 10 minute workouts a lot but since each one starts with a warm up and ends with a cool down, I'm not sure if I'm working out as hard as I could be if the workouts were in one long 50 minute video.  In the 10 minute solutions, I wish there was an option on the video that includes all workouts and excluded warm ups and cool downs (for those who would like to stick with the video but need to advance a little to sweat more). Overall, this is a very nice video.  I feel like I'm in the instructor's studio every time (very encouraging).",1469491200,,678,4.082706766917293
8158907,5,B000KRNMQ2,"I love this video series. It is quick, efficient and effective.  If you only have 10 minutes then just do one video or for a more intense workout do several.  This is my go to series when I want to get a good workout!",1468540800,,217,3.909090909090909
8158908,4,B000KRNMQ2,"Man, after just TEN MINUTES I am dripping with sweat! My plan was to do 20 minutes in a row but I need a break. I'm going to do the other ten minutes later. I just love these workouts. I'm not quite at the fitness level yet where I can do all the moves in the Interval Burn workout, but I'm working towards it. I LOVE the metabolism booster! I'm not a huge fan of the boxing one, just because I don't enjoy boxing. Overall I recommend this to anyone who is trying to get or stay in shape because you can really get a good workout in in just 10 minutes.",1381708800,,552,3.9375
8158909,2,B000KRNMQ2,"Very slow to ship and slow to deliver. Almost three weeks since I placed the order and I have no idea when I am going to receive it. It looks interesting, which is why I haven't cancelled the order yet. Will give it a couple more days.",1381190400,,235,4.0212765957446805
8158910,5,B000KRNMQ2,"I've been trying for a long time to find a workout routine that not only kept me engaged, gave me results and didn't require a lot of equipment or space. I've belonged to gyms, but found workouts on the the cardio and weight machines to be boring and I couldn't get motivated to go to the gym. I signed up for a Zumba class, loved it and started seeing results. It was only one day per week and I wanted to exercise a few more days out of the week and since there weren't any other group classes on a long term basis, I ended up checking this video out from my local library. I immediately enjoyed it. This kind of cardio bodywork is really what I enjoy doing. I have a very small space to workout in and this video didn't need a lot of space to move but still allowed me to work up a wicked sweat. During the workouts that require a mat, I do standing crunches, countertop pushups and other movements that still keep me active and burning calories. I love being able to create a workout routine with the different videos and I can do them in any order, whatever works best for me. I always end up doing the Power Blast last, and it kicks my butt right up to the end! I'm already starting to see results after about 5 workouts combined with my Zumba class and riding my bicycle as well as changing my diet. This is a great video for people of any skill level or size. I'm about 230 lbs and can't squat or lunge as deep yet, but I don't feel there's anything I can't do in the routines. Even the jumps in the Power Blast aren't too hard on my knees and feet which I sometimes have problems with. Awesome video, definitely recommend and I'll be buying it from Amazon!",1371513600,2,1665,4.173913043478261
8158911,5,B000KRNMQ2,"I use this workout, or portions of it, several times a week. Some of the workouts can be challenging but most are not so hard that I cannot complete 2 or 3 in a session. I like the 10 minute format that lets me get in some exercise as my time allows.",1367020800,,250,3.826923076923077
8158912,5,B000KRNMQ2,"She is a great teacher, her instructions are clear and easy to follow. I get a good workout in 10 minutes and can easily increase the time if I want to exercise more than that.",1366588800,,176,4.057142857142857
8158913,3,B000KRNMQ2,"The video would be great if it didn't skip I would have preferred to get it in a hard copy. If it didn't skip, I think it would be an awesome workout.",1363392000,,150,3.71875
8158914,4,B000KRNMQ2,Each 10 minute segment worked up a sweat; giving the option to be done after one segment and feeling like the workout was worth it. It was also simple to continue to the next segment when time allowed.,1358121600,,201,4.315789473684211
