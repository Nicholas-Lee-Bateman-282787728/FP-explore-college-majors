2517504,5,B000EFQYHE,"I have had a few ballroom dance classes and this series is a very good supplement to them.  Series 1 handles the very beginning steps and does not go very far, but it is an excellent starter series.  The instructors are very easy to watch and follow.",1167782400,7,250,4.297872340425532
2517505,5,B000EFQYHE,Wonderful dance dvd. Better than going to a class. My boyfriend and I are really into it. I am excited about the 3rd one that came out. You will not be sorry with this dance dvd! :o),1160438400,8,182,3.945945945945946
2517506,5,B000EFQYHE,"This is a good product for those just beginning to dance.  It gives basic overview of Foxtrot, Waltz, Tango, Rumba, Samba, Swing, Merengue, Salsa, Cha-Cha and Hustle.  The instructors, Dennis Kalle and his wife Theresa do a good job.  Dennis does all the talking with a New York accent touched with New York humor.  Theresa is cute but quiet.  I viewed and practiced along with the CD in advance of taking lessons with a live instructor which enhanced my lessons.  I just wish Dennis and Theresa would issue a ""Series 2"" advanced CD on the dances they give the basics for on their Series 1 Collection.",1153267200,33,601,4.622641509433962
2517507,5,B000EFQYHE,"This CD was wonderful,The grace and style an d ease with which the Kalles teach is wonderful. There humor and class just add to the experience. Watch the CD and learn you will feel like there old friends..2 thumbs up DANCE AUTHORITY!!!",1146441600,19,235,4.619047619047619
2517508,5,B000EFQYHE,"I had the pleasure of working with this DVD, and I feel as if I know the couple, Mr. & Mrs Kalle, like good friends. Their professional manner, mixed with a relaxinging sence of humor, make this introduction to Ballroom dancing easy and fun to follow.  The Kalles have developed their style to dance as well as share that style with their students.  Buy it, try it, you'll be happy!",1146009600,24,382,4.442857142857143
2517509,1,B000EFQYHE,THis product is very basic and not a good tool if you have taken more than one class already.,1180656000,5,93,3.9473684210526314
2517510,5,B000EFQYHE,The DVD takes you no-frills through the basic steps. Very easy to learn from their non-domineering manner. Definitely one you can give to a new dancer and have them dancing in no time.,1178150400,6,184,4.606060606060606
2517511,4,B000EFQYHE,"I have purchased a number of different dance video lessons in the past six year and have much to compare to. For this reason I have to endorse the Kalle's DVDs as the most worthwhile of all. They show enough -- but not too much at one time. They are  actually teaching, rather than just talking and demonstrating what they can do. One improvement I would suggest is to show the steps in the inset box from the OPPOSITE side, which as presently used wastes space as it only shows smaller what you are already seeing in the full screen.",1174521600,17,534,4.34
2517512,5,B000EFQYHE,"I purchased this DVD with my husband as my dance partner in mind but have found that my sons ages 6,11, and 14 are more frequently my partners than he is! My sons and I can easily pick up the steps and dance around the living room.  And as a homeschooling mother, I can count our dancing lessons as gym! My husband says he has enjoyed our few lessons, too!  I've gone through my extremely limited library of children's classical music looking for some music I can waltz to by myself and I found myself doing the cha-cha to the music playing at the roller skating rink (no, I didn't have skates on - I was just helping my 6-yr. old!)! It's fun!!!  The short practice music for each lesson is great, too!",1174089600,,702,4.2631578947368425
2517513,3,B000EFQYHE,Totally for beginners. I could have paid a dance instructor $10 more and learned more moves than what was shown.,1173312000,8,112,4.65
2517514,4,B000EFQYHE,"Quality of instruction is great, but screen resolution (clarity) could be better.  Many dance steps are included with practice music following each set of instructions.  Split-screen presentation helps to identify exact steps in each routine.",1172102400,7,242,5.885714285714286
2517515,4,B000EFQYHE,excellent teaching ability from both Dennis and Theresa - Dennis has also humor and that makes it easier to follow.,1171670400,3,115,4.8
2517516,5,B000EFQYHE,Dennis and Theresa teach 3 steps on the introductory level for each of 10 dances and point out the similarities among the various dances.  Dennis has a pleasing personality.  I was pleased with the DVD.,1171584000,5,202,4.742857142857143
2517517,5,B000EFQYHE,This DVD was just perfect for us. Each dance step is clearly shown and described. There is a PIP for the steps. Each dance shows only the most basic steps so that beginners like us were not overwhelmed with tryng to learn the fancy stuff right away. We are eager to try the next DVD in the series as soon as we are grounded in the basics.,1170806400,4,338,4.059701492537314
2517518,5,B000EFQYHE,"This DVD was great!  Dennis Kalle hits on all the learning styles as he teaches:  he speaks the direction, it's written for you to read, and you can see it as he teaches.  For a beginner, he spends an appropriate amount of time practicing with and without music.  As one who knows nothing about dance, after a few lessons from this DVD, I feel like I can get on the dance floor!",1169769600,6,378,4.208333333333333
8109041,4,B000EFQYHE,Its an older video so its not up to todays standards of video quality but its an easy video that helps beginners review the steps.,1375488000,,130,4.24
8109042,4,B000EFQYHE,Great for beginners or as a refresher for those who have not ballroom danced in a while.  Dennis does a great job of showing and explaining both the men's steps and the women's steps.,1360281600,,183,4.382352941176471
8109043,2,B000EFQYHE,My wife got this dance DVD for me since we have taken a couple dance classes at our local high school. Now with a small child it is harder to get out of the house.  I was mostly interested in the swing dance section and found it hard to follow. I found the instructions where not basic enough.,1250812800,,293,4.051724137931035
8109044,4,B000EFQYHE,"I've been ballroom dancing for over 40 years and bought this cd along with vols. 2 & 3 to brush up on some of the dances that we don't do frequently. If you don't keep dancing, you forget a lot of what used to come naturally. Their specialty seems to be Latin dances - swing is not their forte. All steps from discs 1 and 2 are reviewed in disc 3 and that is all I really needed to buy. The pace is slow and repetitive for experienced dancers, but might be just fine for real beginners. Since they cover so many styles the cd set can't go much beyond the basics. The instruction is pretty clear and the camera shots are good enough to learn the steps. If you are a total beginner you might want to start with disc 1; if you are brushing up or adding a couple of styles disc 2 covers all the steps in disc 1. If you have a lot of experience all you need is disc 3.",1200268800,5,863,3.9371428571428573
8109045,3,B000EFQYHE,"Not as good as DVD 1. It spends over 50% of the time reviewing with too little grogress. Over all, it keeps its style easy to follow on one hand and, on the other, it lacks plotting and seriousness which dispoints viewers.",1199577600,2,222,4.309523809523809
8109046,5,B000EFQYHE,A superior DVD for those who want to learn the basics of the 10 most popular dance step!  Good for beginners or even those who know how to do basic dance steps - it gives you three different moves per type of dance.,1191196800,4,215,4.0
8109047,5,B000EFQYHE,"I bought this DVD For my brother and sister in law, while in Canada.  I looked at the DVD along with my brother-in-law.

His first remark after reviewing the DVD he said, ""1-2-3-4, Box step for waltz,foxtrot,rumba, samba"", ""Wow, this makes it real easy"".  From there it was easy for him to start his basic ballroom dancing.

I was very satisfied with the product for the purpose of helping both of them start basic ballroom dancing.",1190419200,4,432,4.644736842105263
8109048,3,B000EFQYHE,"This is a good basic guide for the dance steps to get you going to the dance floor.  It isn't fancy or glamorous, and Dennis does all the talking, but it is easy to follow.  Unfortunately, it gets a little boring and and music is just ok.",1189382400,5,238,4.042553191489362
8109049,5,B000EFQYHE,"Having taken private lessons and been frustrated, this series is excellent. Unlike the private lessons my wife and I took, this really teaches the man how to lead! Nothing is more important than a proper lead. You really want DVD 2 at the same time, they work well together.",1185148800,5,274,4.612244897959184
8109050,4,B000EFQYHE,If you can't dance a lick you can still learn the basics and fake it pretty good.,1182816000,2,81,3.823529411764706
