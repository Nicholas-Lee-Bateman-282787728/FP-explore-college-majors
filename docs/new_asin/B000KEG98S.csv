8155841,2,B000KEG98S,"This DVD is disappointing.  I watched the DVD very closely and I wasn't impressed with the quality of the forms done by Master Uechi and why he performed them bare chested.  I expected much more from one of the headmasters of the style.  Since it was an old tape the poor video quality may have made it difficult to see the fine points and contributed to the overall impression when viewing the DVD..  The workout in the Dojo had poor quality as well.  The resolution of the two partner practice drills was poor and the angles didn't clearly show the fine points of the drills.  Uechi Ryu is much more than presented in this video.  Other than perhaps historical interest to Uechi practitioners more modern books and DVD's with much higher quality photos, high resolution DVD's and better directing will be of more use and justify the cost.",1447027200,,840,4.635135135135135
