2728167,5,B000MCIC3I,I used to watch this show as a teenager and I loved it! I began looking for this show on dvd for years and was so glad to finally order it and have it in my hands. Desmond's portrays a West Indian family with real accents and no sterotyped cliches. This show is for anyone who loves family programming with guaranteed laughs. As a person who comes from a West Indian family it is greatly appreciated to finally have a show that I can watch over and over without cringing at the fake accents.,1223856000,,491,4.23404255319149
2728168,5,B000MCIC3I,I first saw Desmond's when I first came to this country and it's frequent references to Guyana and the easy going life there was comforting. It was fun comparing the parenting styles that are still hard to change even today for many Guyanese fathers!!!,1221264000,6,252,4.75
2728169,5,B000MCIC3I,"Finally!! I found it.

I own a lot of British comedies and I have been looking for Desmond's for many years now.

Besides 'Chef'; Desmond's is the only comedy that I know of from Britian with the majority of cast members who are of African descent.

BET showed many episodes during the 1990s. I was surprised that it was not shown anywhere else.",1206144000,5,345,4.444444444444445
2728170,5,B000MCIC3I,"At last, this great show is finally on dvd. This was the only Brit-com I had seen with a Black cast. This series takes place in a barber shop , with Desmond (Norman Beaton--he appeared the Cosby Show) and  his wife Shirley, played by Carmen Munroe. Together with their 3 children and the barber-shop regulars Matthew and Porkpie, you never knew what was going to happen next.
It was hilarious,up-beat and great comedy. If you are a Bit-com fan, you will really enjoy this show.",1191888000,6,477,4.6117647058823525
2728171,5,B000MCIC3I,"In the early 90's Desmond's was shown on BET cable channel and this is where most American were exposed to the comedy. This is one of the funniest shows to come from the BBC channel 4.  It is up there with Are you being served and Keeping up Appearances.
Desmond's is about a West Indian barber his wife and family and the regulars that frequent his shop. The cast consists of Desmond Ambrose played by (Norman Beaton),  who owns the Barber shop with his wife Shirley (Carmen Munroe). He has three children Michael (Geff Francis), Gloria (Kim Walker) and Sean (Justin Pickett). Regular customers were the West Indian, Dominoes mad Porkpie (Ram John Holder), one of Desmond's old friends (about 50) African student Matthew (Gyearbuor Asante) and Shaky Lee  (Robin Gee) hair stylist Tony (Dominic Keating) and Gloria's best friend Louise (Lisa Geoghan).

If you are  from the Islands or  you  like  BBC comedies you will enjoy this series. It is a wonderful and truly funny comedy series. If you are feeling down and want something to cheer up to this DVD definitely worth the money, You can watch the episode over and over again.  The DVD contains 3 discs series (season) one and two.",1188518400,21,1183,4.7317073170731705

2728175,5,B000MCIC3I,"The funniest show ever! I saw this on television in the mid 80's and I was hooked I have never seen a non-American show that had me hooked so fast this show will have you in stitches the father Desmond is so funny the mom is a sweetheart the sensible one and aunty susu is a riot. The cast is the best ever they all fit perfectly you really believe them as a family,the older brother is such a cutie the show has a Sanford and son feel with a family matters vibe and comedic flow of the show Martin. The best  money ever spent was to buy this set. It never gets old you will crack up so much it's that funny and the accents make it even better to watch. I would buy this again and again.",1388102400,,687,3.9424460431654675

2728178,5,B000MCIC3I,DESMOND'S BARBER SHOP ALWAYS REMINDS US OF THE RARE OPPORTUNITIES OF A CLEAN AND WHOLESOME FAMILY FRIENDLY STORYLINE NOT SEEN ON A REGULAR BASIS. WHERE'S SUCH STORYLINES TODAY WITH BLACK PEOPLE? PEASE AND RICE SMALL ENOUGH FOR THE MICE GIVES US A SPOONFUL OF WHAT WE'RE MISSING DAY AND NIGHT. THAT AIN'T RIGHT.,1368144000,,310,4.867924528301887
2728179,2,B000MCIC3I,I noticed I had received the dvds a few days before I was said to be delivered. In purchasing a bunch of dvds my only fault was that to watch them all before the return date is hard.  Of course it takes a person to watch the dvds to realize if there is a problem which in my case there was.  Very dissappointing!!!,1365379200,,314,3.9682539682539684
