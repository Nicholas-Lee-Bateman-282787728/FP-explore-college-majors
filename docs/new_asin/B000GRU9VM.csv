Now take put what you know about them into the same room and make them do a drum off and duet together.  Bozzio's playing is fantastic, Ive been nutty about that guy ever since I was in highschool (let alone the Zappa years) when he was tourting and giving drum presentations and work shops. Wackerman is reletively new to me by comparison but he is equally as good technically and sonically.  This is of course the second of these meetings by the two drum behemoths and it is just as good as the first one.  It is entertaining to watch and listen too, but you wojnt find much in the way of  training material if you are a drummer lookinfg for instruction- this is something to inspire you more than train.",1203984000,2,801,4.348993288590604
