2963907,4,B000WBMKSW,I recently purchased several Firm DVDs and this is one of my favorites.  I love that it really does target the lower body and that it doesn't involve some of the tricker moves that the others do. (for those of us who are have coordination challenges).  Kelsie is very motivating and does a great job.  I think it could have been a little longer though - I like the 40-45 minute workouts.,1212883200,7,387,4.347222222222222
2963908,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is a great, short workout to add onto other vids or to use in a time-crunch.  Kelsie is a GREAT instructor, very pleasant and natural as a lead.  She is probably the first instructor I have worked out to thinking that she would be a perfect personal trainer.
The workout includes target toning of the lower body, with 30 second cardio bursts.. once I did the video once and knew what was coming, I started the movements at the ""advanced"" level to up the intensity.  It is a solid intermediate workout, which you can customize by adding more flair to the movements. I also loved the cool-down, the stretches felt sooo good.  Definitely worth the purchase if you want to tone your legs and lift that butt!",1212796800,12,708,4.5078125
2963909,5,B000WBMKSW,"I love this workout featuring Firm master instructor Kelsie Daniels! The workout lasts about 30 minutes (perfect for me with a busy two-year old) and is a super blend of firming exercises and cardio. The workout provides intense lower body exercises with the use of medium (I use 5 pound) and heavier (I use 8-pound) weights. Moreover, I really appreciate the cardio bursts. This workout, overall, keeps your heartrate up and strenghthens you thighs, etc. I'm very pleased with this DVD! Kelsie is awesome!

FYI, you can preview the DVD on the Firm's website. That's what I did, but I bought it on Amazon (cheaper) from one of their sellers. GREAT BUY!!!",1210809600,16,654,4.839285714285714
2963910,4,B000WBMKSW,"I wanted a workout that was effective and time efficeint and this is it.  As a single mom, short on time, can't reach the gym and loves to exercise, this is the workout for me when i don't have the time to train for an hour and racing to get to work.  The combinations are effective and i am seeing results on my legs when i want to target train my legs once a week in combination with my other workouts.",1209340800,8,404,3.9753086419753085
2963911,5,B000WBMKSW,"Kelsey's cues were excellent as usual, tough workout that works your entire lower body, while working up a sweat. Highly reccommend!",1207440000,14,132,5.333333333333333
2963912,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is a pretty good lower body workout.  I'm not a beginner at this, so I have pretty high expectations!  Definitely will get you sweating!  It's good to see the instructor sweating too...",1207008000,10,190,4.696969696969697
2963913,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is a fantastic workout.  It's enjoyable, fun and makes you work hard.  It's aerobic interval training and the toning is geared for the lower body.  By working these larger muscles, you not only keep your heart rate up at all times, but you burn fat more.  It's easy to follow and Kelsie is a good instructor.  There are five segments and it takes about a half hour for the whole routine.  This is good if you are short on time, but want an effective workout.  You need some dumbells and you're good to go.
I like The Firm dvds.  This is no exception.  Because it's non complicated and fun, this is becoming a workout I do at least every second day.  I enjoy it and hope you will too.",1206230400,27,688,4.223076923076923
2963914,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is one of the newest workouts from the Firm, and I like it a lot. It's not quite as tough as Firm Lower Body Sculpt 1 (an older all-standing lower body workout), but it is more aerobic and still quite challenging. Plus, it was nice to see instructor Kelsie Daniels again--she looks just as good as in her old Firm/FitPrime days!

Kelsie moves very quickly through a 5-minute warm-up (I had a little trouble keeping up with her transitions the first time through). She adds interesting twists to basic moves such as bob & weave, knee ups, outer thigh lifts, and inner thigh touches; the warm-up concludes with a moving stretch for the hip flexors, calves, and quads.  The main part of the workout is structured so that you do a toning series on one leg, do a short (30-40 seconds) cardio burst, and then repeat the toning series on the other leg. Kelsie cues either heavy or medium weights for each series; since it was my first time through and I was already pre-exhausted from another workout, I just used 10# the whole way through, but you could definitely go heavier.

Kelsie begins with a curtsey dip, upping the intensity by adding a knee lift and then a quad extension. She also performs a single leg squat, again adding the knee lift (which was killer here!). The first cardio blast consists of a back lunge combined with a knees high jog, and then the weight work is repeated with the other leg. In the next series, Kelsie starts with a side squat, first adding abduction, then a repeating abduct lift with balance and final a rear glute lift. A fun cardio blast follows: you begin with a simple hamstring curl but progress to a hopscotch move.  The next weighted series starts with a one-legged dead lift, then adds a heel push to the rear. This is followed by a short forward squat adding a rear glute lift. Kelsie calls the next cardio segment jumping jacks, but the are more jumping planks: you jump the feet out to plank position and then jump them in and out. For the final weighted series, you'll do a 4-count plie, adding a leg balance and then also a leg lift. I loved the final cardio sequence of plie squat to side leg kick.  With about 7 minutes left to the workout, Kelsi does brief cardio cool-down consisting of a few squats with back rolls and a few more plies. She then transitions to the floor for some short, one-legged bridge work which is nicely interspersed with stretching moves for the hamstrings. Kelsie concludes the workout with some nice seated stretches (forward bend, side stretch), bringing in the total time at 31 minutes.

Overall, a nicely intense, solidly intermediate, fun lower body workout that I know I will enjoy doing again and again:  4 1/2 stars!",1204243200,60,2702,4.581780538302278
2963915,5,B000WBMKSW,"This workout will work you. I tried it for the first time with weights and had to put them down half way through. It's more on the advanced side, but it will give you the results you want.",1204156800,15,188,3.973684210526316

It's not quite as tough as Firm Lower Body Sculpt 1 (an earlier all-standing lower body workout), but it is more aerobic and still quite challenging. Plus, it was nice to see instructor Kelsie Daniels again!  She hasn't changed a bit from FitPrime Steamin' Cardio: she still cues great and moves with precise, perfect form. She works out here in the new Firm studio with two other Firm instructors in the background.

Overall, a nicely intense, fun lower body workout; I liked the music toom as it seemed less ""canned"" than other Firm music.  I know that I will enjoy doing this workout again and again; definitely recommended!",1198022400,3,2941,4.609942638623327
2963917,5,B000WBMKSW,"I LOVE the CD's. The workout program came on time and was in perfect shape.

I have used the Firm in the past and was never disappointed.and I wasn't.

When I fast started working out with the CD's it was difficult due to my lower back. But I kept working at it moring and evening. I stared to see results in four (4) day's. With that result I WAS SHOCKED but I could see a differance. Very pleased with the program. Looking Good!",1427587200,,430,4.168674698795181

2963926,3,B000WBMKSW,"I liked the dvd a lot, however, I did not open it for about a month after I purchased it and when I finally did, I found that it did not play all the way through - it skipped a good part of it and then picked back up at the end. That was very disappointing especially since I'd lost the ability to return/exchange it by then.",1410134400,,325,3.8656716417910446

2963929,5,B000WBMKSW,Loved it. Wish it were a bit longer but it works great as an express workout when you're running short on time as well as an add on workout when you want to focus more on the lower body.,1406937600,,186,3.7948717948717947
2963930,5,B000WBMKSW,"Ok, so I'm totally not out of shape but wanted to firm up and def lift my booty. I got this in the mail right away and started my first session last night. It's about 40 mins long of a workout! This kicked my butt!! I had to take a 15 min break and gulp my protein shake (I use Syntha-6 and creatine from GNC) then back at it again. My mom was watching making sure I completed the video. Today, My thighs are a tad sore and I feel my glute muscles tightening. Please note: I have been squatting for 3 weeks now. This is a must get if you want something fast paced! Some of the exercises I couldn't master but I substituted. Also, creatine IS NOT for losing weight. It makes you gain muscle for those who want a muscular body. Also, you will need more than ten glasses of water a day with this stuff since it makes you hold water.",1400112000,2,829,4.03030303030303
2963931,5,B000WBMKSW,Don't let a little hard work scare you away from Kelsie's workout. If you want a good rear view she'll help you get there. No wimps or at least leave your wimp attitude when you hit the play button cause she's not having it.,1374537600,2,224,4.113636363636363
2963932,4,B000WBMKSW,"The video moves too fast from one move to the next, considering that lower body stuff uses your knees. Owch.",1373500800,,108,4.45
2963933,4,B000WBMKSW,Really enjoyed this video with Kelsie Daniels as the lead instructor. She's got boundless energy and a cheerful personality that does't come across as overly perky or annoying. I use Tight Buns and Killer Legs in my workout rotation when I want to do a quick video that concentrates on my biggest problem area---my booty. I'm glad the firm came out with a video that makes doing lunges and squats somewhat enjoyable.,1366156800,,416,4.791666666666667
2963934,5,B000WBMKSW,"I did this workout with and without leg weights.  Without weights it seemed low impact to moderate. I didn't want it to end.  With weights it felt like I rode a Montana Mustang without a saddle.  Kelsie starts the routine with a 5min low impact warm-up/stretch.  Then the lunges and jumps start, but there is a modifier.  I also used 5-10lb dumbbells.  My legs weights are 5lbs each.  She ends it at about 30mins with a stretch.",1362873600,,428,4.48051948051948
2963935,4,B000WBMKSW,"What I like about this video is that I can do it in 30 minutes, not sweat too much, and really feel the exercises working my muscles.  The instruction is very clear - in fact, my DVD player sometimes loses the video feed (a problem with my machine, not the DVD) for 30 seconds or so, but with just the audio description I am able to keep up with changes in this video. A good choice for weight training days with just enough cardio to get your heart pumping.",1358899200,,458,4.146067415730337
2963936,4,B000WBMKSW,"As some reviewers have said, this video is pretty quick paced.  But, if you are familiar with basic moves (lunges, etc) it isn't hard to catch up with the instructor.  The moves are fast, but not tricky.  I felt like I got a good workout, but I wouldn't say it was a tough challenge.  Adding heavier weights would easily take this workout into a more challenging zone.  I really enjoyed this workout though!  It went by so quickly and I felt energized upon completion.  Some reviewers have also complained about not having enough reps.  My thought would be to pause the video and add a few reps of your own.  You own the pause button...pause away!  Bonus-it is only 31 minutes in length...leaving enough time to do some more hard-core weight training or some pilates if you desire. I will most likely use this video on my more ""off"" days or follow this up with some intense weight training.",1344988800,3,890,4.540880503144654
2963937,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is a great short cardio/toning workout.  Yes, it moves quickly.  Yes, you may have to do it a few times before you get all the moves.  So what?  I myself am a great believer in leg press on the box, and there is none of that here.  But this  workout is fast and fun.  Kelsie's routines are terrific, and there are no music timing problems like with the ""500 Calorie"" workout.  I've been doing the Firm since the mid-90's; I'm now in my early 50's, and my knees won't let me fully execute a lunge anymore.  But I still get a great sweat from this workout.",1338940800,3,559,4.149532710280374
2963938,1,B000WBMKSW,DVD SUCKED.. didn't like it..it was too fast pace and didn't feel anything after working out. There should be an instructional section to show some of the moves.,1335484800,,161,4.785714285714286
2963939,5,B000WBMKSW,"I purchased this because I wanted something that was short, with emphasis on lower body toning, that I could do as a ""secondary"" workout in the evenings. I workout daily in the mornings, but enjoy an evening ""metabolism booster"" from time to time. Well this workout is great if you are looking for a supplement or just want a short, effective workout. I don't know why people wrote that it is too ""slow"", it is not. I am an advanced exerciser and I had sweat dripping down my face/back. If you need more intensity, use heavier weight or put on ankle weights. I am SO glad I did not listen to the negative reviews about this and decided to purchase! I will be using this with my other Firm workouts and Jillian Michael's DVD's.",1330905600,5,726,4.425373134328358
2963940,5,B000WBMKSW,"I really like this workout.  Kelsie is encouraging, upbeat and her cueing is very good.  I like the cardio bursts because they get your heart rate up between sculpting sets.  This is a good choice for those days when you want an effective workout but don't have time to do a long one.  Highly recommended!",1310342400,,305,4.490909090909091
2963941,5,B000WBMKSW,This DVD is really great for beginners or people looking to tone up.  The instructions are both fun and motivating.  I try to fit this into my workout routine at least 3 times a week! Great result if you follow instructions.,1284336000,,224,4.439024390243903
2963942,5,B000WBMKSW,"You want a short but tough workout to tone your butt and legs?  Then this DVD is for you!  It's only about 30 minutes long, but even for someone like me who works out regularly, it is challenging but very effective.  Kelsie pairs weight training with short bursts of cardio so you get the maximum benefits of working out.  I love it and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to firm up their lower body!",1272499200,,409,4.342105263157895
2963943,1,B000WBMKSW,"Okay, perhaps if I were a robot on speed this dvd would be great but the fact is I am not. The instructor talks way too fast and never once shows what she is doing but rather launches into each move at warp speed with no preamble. Great if you already know what's coming and know this dvd routine inside and out. The exercises are too fast and too furious almost as if there's a war on fat and if you don't race to the end you're doomed.
I have had my share of work out dvds and given the amount of fitness classes and dance classes I've done in my life I am no noob at this, but this dvd sucked in terms of INSTRUCTION: it makes you work and you do sweat but you'd better know what you are doing before you shove it in the machine. Maybe if you're a pro sports person this is the dvd for you but as an amateur, looking to get fit, this was a horrible experience that probably won't get better with time.

Find something less trendy with better instruction if you are a beginner or just getting back into it if you are a pro you might like the fast pace and warp speed chatter.",1268870400,10,1077,4.0093023255813955

2963945,3,B000WBMKSW,I found this DVD to be just ok. I would rather do more repetitions and more organized leg work. I was hoping for a DVD that would make leg work a cardio workout.

2963947,1,B000WBMKSW,I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I feel like I wasted the precious 45 minutes I had set aside to really get a great workout.  Most of the exercises had 8 counts total.  That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape.  I did not find it challenging.  I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up.  I don't even recommend it for beginners because it switched too quickly to follow.  I give it a thumbs down.,1240704000,8,482,4.118279569892473
2963948,3,B000WBMKSW,"The instructor spends NO time teaching you the routine, so starting this workout is like walking into an aerobics class for the first time mid-way, and trying to keep up!

2963953,4,B000WBMKSW,"This DVD consists of isolated leg workouts (with or without light weights- no Transfirmer step needed) and cardio sessions.

Each leg is equally worked out and the movements are not hard, but the cueing isn't the best so one may need to watch the movements before performing.  I'm not a supporter of very fast movements (explosive perhaps) that ask the workout person to hop and perform knee movements since that is such a tender area.  So use caution until you get used to the overall movement/concepts.

These are unique movements/exercises that I haven't seen elsewhere.  I like this more for the time concentration and I feel that I get a decent workout in the 30-min than I might do on my own.

Realize that this DVD is both leg exercises combined with cardio.",1223856000,6,765,4.714285714285714

I will be doing this video pretty often.",1218672000,3,339,4.317460317460317
2963955,5,B000WBMKSW,"i have quite a few firm dvds, and i would have to say this is definitely one of the best i have bought so far, top 3. its strictly lower body toning, with continuous ""calorie blasts"" to keep your heart rate up and burn extra fat and calories. you need some 5 lb dumbbells, and maybe some 3 lbs ones to double up with the 5's, or a pair of 8's if you don't wanna hold extra to double up. i recommend this video for a person who is in fairly good shape, i'm 20 and i've lost 30 pounds and i consider myself in decent shape but this video had me huffin and puffin halfway through, and the woman leading the video is in her late 30's too i believe! but i would definitely recommend this video, great muscle toning for your butt, legs and hips with a good stretch at the end, all in 30 minutes :-)",1218585600,6,792,3.9874213836477987

The workout lasts about 30 minutes (perfect for me with a busy two-year old) and is a super blend of firming exercises and cardio. The workout provides intense lower body exercises with the use of medium (I use 5 pound) and heavier (I use 8-pound) weights. Moreover, I really appreciate the cardio bursts. This workout, overall, keeps your heartrate up and strenghthens you thighs, etc. I'm very pleased with this DVD! Kelsie is awesome!

FYI, you can preview the DVD on the Firm's website. That's what I did, but I bought it on Amazon (cheaper) from one of their sellers. GREAT BUY!!!",1210809600,16,654,4.839285714285714

3198410,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is a fantastic workout.  It's enjoyable, fun and makes you work hard.  It's aerobic interval training and the toning is geared for the lower body.  By working these larger muscles, you not only keep your heart rate up at all times, but you burn fat more.  It's easy to follow and Kelsie is a good instructor.  There are five segments and it takes about a half hour for the whole routine.  This is good if you are short on time, but want an effective workout.  You need some dumbells and you're good to go.
I like The Firm dvds.  This is no exception.  Because it's non complicated and fun, this is becoming a workout I do at least every second day.  I enjoy it and hope you will too.",1206230400,27,688,4.223076923076923
3198411,5,B000WBMKSW,"This is one of the newest workouts from the Firm, and I like it a lot. It's not quite as tough as Firm Lower Body Sculpt 1 (an older all-standing lower body workout), but it is more aerobic and still quite challenging. Plus, it was nice to see instructor Kelsie Daniels again--she looks just as good as in her old Firm/FitPrime days!

Kelsie moves very quickly through a 5-minute warm-up (I had a little trouble keeping up with her transitions the first time through). She adds interesting twists to basic moves such as bob & weave, knee ups, outer thigh lifts, and inner thigh touches; the warm-up concludes with a moving stretch for the hip flexors, calves, and quads.  The main part of the workout is structured so that you do a toning series on one leg, do a short (30-40 seconds) cardio burst, and then repeat the toning series on the other leg. Kelsie cues either heavy or medium weights for each series; since it was my first time through and I was already pre-exhausted from another workout, I just used 10# the whole way through, but you could definitely go heavier.

Kelsie begins with a curtsey dip, upping the intensity by adding a knee lift and then a quad extension. She also performs a single leg squat, again adding the knee lift (which was killer here!). The first cardio blast consists of a back lunge combined with a knees high jog, and then the weight work is repeated with the other leg. In the next series, Kelsie starts with a side squat, first adding abduction, then a repeating abduct lift with balance and final a rear glute lift. A fun cardio blast follows: you begin with a simple hamstring curl but progress to a hopscotch move.  The next weighted series starts with a one-legged dead lift, then adds a heel push to the rear. This is followed by a short forward squat adding a rear glute lift. Kelsie calls the next cardio segment jumping jacks, but the are more jumping planks: you jump the feet out to plank position and then jump them in and out. For the final weighted series, you'll do a 4-count plie, adding a leg balance and then also a leg lift. I loved the final cardio sequence of plie squat to side leg kick.  With about 7 minutes left to the workout, Kelsi does brief cardio cool-down consisting of a few squats with back rolls and a few more plies. She then transitions to the floor for some short, one-legged bridge work which is nicely interspersed with stretching moves for the hamstrings. Kelsie concludes the workout with some nice seated stretches (forward bend, side stretch), bringing in the total time at 31 minutes.

Overall, a nicely intense, solidly intermediate, fun lower body workout that I know I will enjoy doing again and again:  4 1/2 stars!",1204243200,60,2702,4.581780538302278

It's about 40 mins long of a workout! This kicked my butt!! I had to take a 15 min break and gulp my protein shake (I use Syntha-6 and creatine from GNC) then back at it again. My mom was watching making sure I completed the video. Today, My thighs are a tad sore and I feel my glute muscles tightening. Please note: I have been squatting for 3 weeks now. This is a must get if you want something fast paced! Some of the exercises I couldn't master but I substituted. Also, creatine IS NOT for losing weight. It makes you gain muscle for those who want a muscular body. Also, you will need more than ten glasses of water a day with this stuff since it makes you hold water.",1400112000,2,829,4.03030303030303

With weights it felt like I rode a Montana Mustang without a saddle.  Kelsie starts the routine with a 5min low impact warm-up/stretch.  Then the lunges and jumps start, but there is a modifier.  I also used 5-10lb dumbbells.  My legs weights are 5lbs each.  She ends it at about 30mins with a stretch.",1362873600,,428,4.48051948051948

The instruction is very clear - in fact, my DVD player sometimes loses the video feed (a problem with my machine, not the DVD) for 30 seconds or so, but with just the audio description I am able to keep up with changes in this video. A good choice for weight training days with just enough cardio to get your heart pumping.",1358899200,,458,4.146067415730337
3198433,4,B000WBMKSW,"As some reviewers have said, this video is pretty quick paced.  But, if you are familiar with basic moves (lunges, etc) it isn't hard to catch up with the instructor.  The moves are fast, but not tricky.  I felt like I got a good workout, but I wouldn't say it was a tough challenge.  Adding heavier weights would easily take this workout into a more challenging zone.  I really enjoyed this workout though!  It went by so quickly and I felt energized upon completion.  Some reviewers have also complained about not having enough reps.  My thought would be to pause the video and add a few reps of your own.  You own the pause button...pause away!  Bonus-it is only 31 minutes in length...leaving enough time to do some more hard-core weight training or some pilates if you desire.

I myself am a great believer in leg press on the box, and there is none of that here.  But this  workout is fast and fun.  Kelsie's routines are terrific, and there are no music timing problems like with the ""500 Calorie"" workout.  I've been doing the Firm since the mid-90's; I'm now in my early 50's, and my knees won't let me fully execute a lunge anymore.

I don't know why people wrote that it is too ""slow"", it is not. I am an advanced exerciser and I had sweat dripping down my face/back.

3198440,1,B000WBMKSW,"Okay, perhaps if I were a robot on speed this dvd would be great but the fact is I am not. The instructor talks way too fast and never once shows what she is doing but rather launches into each move at warp speed with no preamble. Great if you already know what's coming and know this dvd routine inside and out. The exercises are too fast and too furious almost as if there's a war on fat and if you don't race to the end you're doomed.
I have had my share of work out dvds and given the amount of fitness classes and dance classes I've done in my life I am no noob at this, but this dvd sucked in terms of INSTRUCTION: it makes you work and you do sweat but you'd better know what you are doing before you shove it in the machine. Maybe if you're a pro sports person this is the dvd for you but as an amateur, looking to get fit, this was a horrible experience that probably won't get better with time.

Find something less trendy with better instruction if you are a beginner or just getting back into it if you are a pro you might like the fast pace and warp speed chatter.",1268870400,10,1077,4.0093023255813955

That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape.  I did not find it challenging.  I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up.

Each leg is equally worked out and the movements are not hard, but the cueing isn't the best so one may need to watch the movements before performing.  I'm not a supporter of very fast movements (explosive perhaps) that ask the workout person to hop and perform knee movements since that is such a tender area.  So use caution until you get used to the overall movement/concepts.

These are unique movements/exercises that I haven't seen elsewhere.  I like this more for the time concentration and I feel that I get a decent workout in the 30-min than I might do on my own.
