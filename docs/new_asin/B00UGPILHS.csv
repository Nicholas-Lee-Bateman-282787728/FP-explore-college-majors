8706034,3,B00UGPILHS,"Based on the O Henry story, The Caballero's Way, In Old Arizona is pretty slow and only mildly entertaining. Glimpses of desert scenery, some love scenes, some humor, little action, and too much dull dialogue. Thats the first half of the movie. The second half actually becomes interesting and makes the film worth watching. Considering its an early talkie, the video transfer is quite good, but the audio results in dialogue that is very hard to understand at times. If you are a fan of early talkies, this is a good example. If you are looking for 90 minutes of entertainment, I could go either way on recommending you spend 90 minutes of your life watching In Old Arizona.",1463529600,,675,4.680672268907563
