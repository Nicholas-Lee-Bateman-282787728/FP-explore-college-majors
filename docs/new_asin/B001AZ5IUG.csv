3475650,3,B001AZ5IUG,"This is a wonderful and amazing anime. Lots of excitement and drama and characters that live in all kinds of shades of grey. I truly enjoy this anime. The box set is excellently done with a very pretty box and loads of wonderful extras. I especially appreciated the manga.

So why the 3 star review? well this first pressing of discs appears to be defective. Bandai is experimenting with new copy protection and it causes serious problems for many DVD players. In particular seizures at episode 3 in disc 1 and episode 9 in disc2. That is provided  that it works at all. People using blu-ray and in particular PS3 players appear to have much better success rates though.",1218412800,26,670,4.621848739495798
3475651,5,B001AZ5IUG,"This is one of the better Anime's to come out in the states and get air time on TV.  The show appears on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim due to it's graphic violence.  I am sure though that if you are looking at getting this set you probably are already watching it.  This is probably the best buy for getting the episodes.  This set includes volumes 1 and 2 or episodes 1-9.  The set also includes volume one of the Manga, OST 1, and what is best described as a radio show containing the characters on a cd.  It also includes 3 booklets over the shows main characters with interviews from the creators.  The case itself is sturdy with artwork on all sides and on the interior.  If you live in a major city I would suggest picking this up from Best Buy as it is a little bit cheaper, not much though.  If you are going to have it shipped than amazon would be the best bet.",1218326400,38,869,4.155688622754491
3475652,5,B001AZ5IUG,"This anime series is quite simply the best I have ever seen.  It is BEAUTIFUL - quality on par with Claymore or Deathnote - but beyond those, it is highly stylized and unique as well.  The characters are developed and enticing, the plot blows your mind, the pace is so fast you can't blink, and rewatch value is high (I see more every time I watch it).

I have shown this series to several friends and nobody has failed to fall in love yet.  The first season of this series grabs you and sends you on a non-stop roller coaster which ends in a season-end cliff hanger that will quite simply rip your soul from your body and hold it hostage until you get season two and the sweet loving embrace of it's resolution.  Season two is currently (as of July 2008) being aired weekly in Japan and one can imagine will be available in the US eventually as well.

Long story short, if you don't own this anime, you are wrong.  It is absolutely fantastic!",1217376000,15,943,4.323863636363637
3475653,5,B001AZ5IUG,Oh my God! This series is the best I have seen this year! This series is Deathnote with mechas. It will make you cry and you will be glad that you did. Non-stop action with a love for humanity plot.,1217116800,2,198,3.975
3475654,4,B001AZ5IUG,"Imagine a world where the Romans never conquered Britain, and Britain's natives created a vast world-spanning empire of their own. Their latest subjugation: Japan, now called Sector 11.

It's an interesting albeit unlikely idea for alternate-world scifi, and it serves as the basis for ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion."" The first two volumes of this intricate anime series take us right into the action, with only a prologue of the Britannian Empire's history as a buildup. And it doesn't take long for the complex storyline to get moving.

Schoolboy Lelouch Lamperouge tries to help out when a convoy crashes near his motorcycle -- but then HE gets hijacked instead. As the Britannian military and their Knightmares (hello, big mecha!) close in, Lelouch learns that he has inadvertently fallen in with a faction of Japanese freedom fighters. And he also finds that the convoy's cargo is not poison gas as the rebels thought -- but a strange green-haired girl.

But when the Britannian soldiers show up, the girl gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which forces anyone who hears him to do as he commands. Even kill themselves.

So Lelouch uses his new power to hijack one of the Knightmares and assists the rebels (via radio) in a counterattack. But then he uses it to get close to the Britannian prince Clovis, and reveals his true identity -- a presumed-dead Britannian prince, who wants to get revenge for the murder of his mother and destroy the cruel Empire. He starts with Clovis.

But when Lelouch returns to his swank boarding school, he finds that the Japanese freedom fighters may be closer than he expected. As Lelouch organizes a strong new rebellion against the Britannians, he crafts the alter ego of Zero for himself, and a rebellion force known as the Black Knights. But he's still threatened by his treacherous royal family, and by the childhood friend who is on the wrong side of this battle...

""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is one of those wonderfully complex anime stories that has almost too much plot a twenty-minute episode. The very setting is intriguing -- a conquered and humiliated Japan that has been renamed with a number, by a cruel and ancient empire that surpasses ancient Rome. Cool idea, and one that is handled well.

And the writers of this series load on plenty of plot, with lots of chess-like twists and countermoves. We've got exiled princes, mysterious powers, freedom-loving rebels and their enigmatic masked leader, a cruel empire and a bunch of different factions with their own motives. Not to mention a royal family that seems to deal with its feuds by killing each other. Surprisingly, the story never starts feeling overstuffed.

Thankfully in the midst of political strife and confusing mecha fights, the storyline does take some time out to relax. Although it still deals with the rebels and Britannian retaliation, there are some cute lighthearted scenes involving Lelouch's ""regular"" life as a schoolboy, such as one hysterical storyline where a cat steals the ""Zero"" mask. And you have some dry humor -- Lelouch testing his Geass on a teacher, for instance.

But ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" does stretch its credibility occasionally. The mecha Knightmares seem oddly out-of-place in this extremely Anglo culture, and it's hard to imagine that a hardcore political rebel or a soldier could convincingly ""hide"" at a posh school.

Lelouch is a pretty intriguing protagonist as well. He's cold-blooded and lethal, but also incredibly intelligent and sometimes quite compassionate. As he gets fully involved in fighting the Empire, you get the distinct impression that this anti-hero is just getting started. Most of the supporting characters -- including tough girl Kallen, the strange CC and Lelouch's old pal Suzaku -- aren't yet fleshed out yet, but promise to be interesting.

This particular edition has the first two volumes of the series lumped together, which is nice enough. Additionally, it includes a bunch of collector's booklets including a character sketch booklet from the famed manga group that designed the characters, CLAMP.

The first two volumes of the taut, twisty ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" crams more plot into its episodes than many series have in their entirety. Definitely a good buy.",1216684800,8,4296,5.060820367751061
3475655,5,B001AZ5IUG,I have watched this anime on adult swim and I have loved it ever since.  This is the story of a man who wages war against an empire ruled by his tyrannical father.  Lelouch at a very young age was discarded by his father along with his sister and mother.  Now he fights as the infamous Zero in order to bring down the empire and restore Japan to its former glory.  Any anime fan should pick this set up because it has many fantastic characters with unique personalities rarely seen in recent anime. I fell in love with this anime on the first episode and cannot wait until this fantastic series comes on dvd.,1214611200,9,608,4.307017543859649

It is an incredibly clever show that is, in few words, insanely addictive. We watched the entire first season almost straight through. The second season was short to follow. The characters are complex and intriguing, the music is fantastic, the storyline is genius. You will be thoroughly entertained by this show.

This box set is very nice. It comes with ample amounts of bonus material The box itself is solid and has a neat folding, magnetic door that protects the contents. I'm not sure I'd pay $100 for this (as I'm seeing the prices climb), but it's worth $60-$70 easy.",1359590400,,752,4.611940298507463

its about Japan being taken over in the year 2010 by a group or fictual country called Britania, and this 17-year old named Lelouch Lampage wants it to go back to it just being Japan. and there is also other stuff you would have to watch it though.

3475711,5,B001AZ5IUG,"Sunrise should change their slogan to ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it"".

Code Geass is remarkably similar to Gundam Seed... in all the good ways!  But it also throws in enough ingenuity and originality to keep mecha anime fans well engrossed.

The story is unique but contains elements widely used in other series.  The young hero gets caught up in the middle of a battle and is forced to pilot a mecha (so far so Gundam).  He is given mysterious powers by a dying girl, the power enables him to briefly give 'suggestions' to other people whom are incapable of resisting (okay... not so Gundam).  He uses this power to assist in his personal mission to eliminate his enemies (Britannia).  In the middle of this battle he crosses blades unknowingly with a friend (very Gundam).

The plot is centered on a theoretical present in which a vast empire known as Britannia is absorbing most other countries through armed takeovers.  They exalt their own people while push down the majority of the subjugated peoples.  This creates resentment on both sides and leads to much strife and conflict.

The animation is nothing less than you should expect from Sunrise.  There is no lessening of animation quality partially through the series (as you can see in Geneon productions).  The characters are very truly drawn to anime style but are crisp and clean.  Backgrounds are detailed and very dramatic.

The characters are interesting and you do get to know each of them in turn; rather than throwing a dozen characters in and expecting you to know who is whom.  The portrayals are very well executed and each does tend to have a believable personality.  The Japanese voice acting is very good and the actors are well matched to their roles.

All in all this is a breath of fresh air into the mecha anime genre... also because it has a lot of the interpersonal relationships and developments shown.  Actual fighting scenes are short but wonderfully drawn and leave the viewer satisfied and interested.  No overly long, re-used animation fight scenes to become bored of here!

In my opinion, this series takes some of the best aspects of Gundam (animation, voice talent, character development, sound effects, music), gives it a shake, and produces a wonderful and original series.  Well worth a view and/or purchase.",1301443200,,2304,4.8538461538461535
3475712,5,B001AZ5IUG,"The anime is full of military mecha and political leaders and power hungry plots.  Paranoia, schemes, traitors, and scientists.  What more fun could you have?  Yet it is NOTHING like any other anime you have ever seen!  What would you do if somebody gave you the power to make anybody do what you commanded them to do?  But it only worked once and never worked on the same person ever again?
Oh, and you wanted to destroy the very Empire you were part of, to get back at the Father who failed to save your Mother?
Add terrorists, set the whole thing in Japan, add a school, with lots of cool artwork from CLAMP, good characters, wonderful voice actors and actresses.  And a cat.
What do you get?  THIS!

On August 10th of the year 2010 the Holy Empire of Britannia its sights set on Japan and began a campaign of conquest. It took one month thanks to Britannias deployment of new mobile humanoid armor vehicles called Knightmare Frames to take over Japan. Japans lost it rights and its identity was stripped away, now being referred to as Area 11. Its citizens, now called Elevens, are forced to scratch out a living while the Britannians lives in comfortably within their settlements. Pockets of resistance appear throughout Area 11, working towards to free Japan from Britannia's rule. Lelouch Lamperouge, who's his real name is Lelouch vi Britannia, is an exiled Imperial Prince of Britannia who was disowned by his father after his mother was murdered. He and his sister Nunnally were sent to Japan before the war. Now consider dead, Lelouch was now posing as a student in a Britannian school. He soon finds himself in the heart of the ongoing conflict for Japan. Through a chance meeting with old friend named Suzaku Kururugi who was now an Britannian soldier, Leluoch meets a mysterious girl named C2, who gives him the power of Geass, the power of the king. Now endowed with absolute dominance over any person, Lelouch may finally realize his goal of bringing down Britannia from within and fulfilling his two wishes: to seek revenge for his mother and to construct a world in which Nunnally can live happily.

There is a reason Code Geass is so good. Those reasons include the best of, and most relatable characters ever seen in recent anime. Another is the visuals are so beautiful everyting looks good from the mecha to the fanservice. The most prominent reason is how addictive it is.

I love the story, I love mecha, almost about this story is appealing. The ONlY bad thing about this series is how quickly each episode ends. I strongly recommend everyone to buy this series up together as a whole or risk feeling depressed.",1239235200,,636,4.521739130434782

You just can't help but root for the rather demented Lelouch who seeks revenge against his father and those that wronged him and his sister, Nunally. The characters are great, each having their own agendas to fulfill. Action! Lots of it. If you like Gundam, you might like this one, but there tends to be more focus on the characters than the mecha (not to say the mecha are pretty good here, they are!) Animation is fluid, just goes down easy. Music, is pretty good too. Voice acting, I'd say much better in the Japanese language. The English dubbing isn't that great, seems almost as if it were rush. Good thing you can still watch it subbed. Anyways, this anime has it all, and is definitely worth it. Characters are made, do what they have to and die. That's the Clamp way, just so you know.

3475736,5,B001AZ5IUG,"Excellent!  ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is just excellent!

It's been awhile since  I watched an anime series and just enjoyed it from animation, art, mecha designs, music, character designs, storyline, etc.  I may be a late bloomer when it comes to the fandom of ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" but now I can see how this series has captured the attention of fans worldwide.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""CODE OF GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is featured 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The animation and video quality is colorful and digitally modern since it is a newer anime television release.  What I love about the video quality is the sheer amount of people involved.  Everyone with detail, buildings, mecha and the destruction has detail.  The character designs based from CLAMP's character design concepts are just fresh and cool to look at.  One of the coolest looking character designs in an anime mecha series without being a full-on mecha series.  Very cool!

I watched the anime series on my 52' and then afterwards on my 24' LCD and video quality was just great from the character animation to the backgrounds.  Because this series features so much moving around Japan, this series really featured so many things in each different scene.  Again, I'm very impressed with how much went in creating a single episode.

As for the audio, the audio is English and Japanese stereo.  For a television series, I was sort of expecting stereo sound but knowing some television series including Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD soundtracks,  I was hoping that there may have been a Dolby Digital 5.1 track for Code Geass but the audio is stereo.  Dialogue is clear and you can understand what the characters are saying.  Both the English and Japanese voice acting are well done.

If I had one slight problem is that I enjoyed the Japanese voice acting a lot it's just that Johnny Yong Bosch's voice acting of Lelouch sounds too similar to his Ichigo of ""Bleach"".

SPECIAL FEATURES:

You can find really cool special features on both volumes.  Let's start with the volume 1 DVD:

  1. Picture Drama Episode - This is short drama episode featuring non-animated stills or drawings but featuring both Japanese and English voice acting.  This one is about Lelouch and Nunnally arriving to Japan and finding their new place to live.  Lelouch comes into contact with Suzaku.
  2. Audio Commentary - There are three audio commentaries featuring the Japanese voice actor for Lelouch, C.C., the director and the screenwriter.  The voice talent talk about their characters and experience of working with so many voice actors and also their auditions.  They are very careful not to reveal what happens in future episodes, so there is quite a bit of banter about experiences and the voice talent asking the director and screenwriter about certain scenes.  One example is the writer talking about how he fashioned one of the mecha in this series after a mecha from another anime series ""Gasaraki"".
  3. Textless Opening

With the second volume, the special features are:

  * Picture Drama Episode - There are two picture drama episodes included.  One featuring the girls of Ashford Academy all at a hot bath.  The way the characters are featured shows a little sexy fan service as they get to know Kallen.  The second drama episode features Suzaku and Rivalz talking to each other followed by Lloyd and Cecille talking to each other.
  * Audio Commentary - There is one audio commentary for episode 8 and this time featuring Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch), Mitsuaki Madono (Kaname Ohgi), Kazunari Tanaka (Tamaki) and Kawaguchi (producer).  A festive commentary as the Black Knight guys are together and joke around.
  * Textless Ending I

When I first started seeing the positive comments in Japan, followed by the US and then watching the album become the first anime album in nearly two decades to debut at #1 on the Oricon Album Daily Charts, just shows you the popularity of this anime series.

Having now joined the bandwagon of those who love ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"", I can't help but fall in love with this series.  It's great!  A lot of suspense, violence, mecha battles, love triangles, drama, political corruption and so much emotion involved in each episode's storyline and balancing it out with awesome animation, awesome artwork, really great voice acting  on both Japanese and English.  I really feel that ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is an excellent anime series.

The first nine episodes started with a lot of action and each episode thus far have been excellent.  Even the commentary by the Japanese voice talent is lively and fun to listen to.  And I like the addition of the Picture Drama Episodes as well.

With everything so positive, the only negative, and it's really not a negative but more or less I enjoying hearing the action all around me via Dolby Digital 5.1 (especially in DTS-HD or Dolby TrueHD ala Blu-ray) is that I wished that audio was presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 but still dialogue is quite clear and easy to understand in stereo and the music as well.

""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is a fantastic anime series that doesn't come along to frequently.  Everything about Part 1 so far has been excellent and I highly recommend this DVD collection

This product is great. The extras are worth it. The audio discs were a excellent listen and the manga is always a plus. If your already a Code Geass fan than I recommend it as a must buy.",1231632000,,426,4.325
3475748,5,B001AZ5IUG,"Code Geass is one of the essential anime of 2008, with large robots fighting for freedom from western empires.

Japanese residents have always had a love/hate relationship with America. On one hand, American imports have advanced Japan as one of the most advanced countries in the world. On the other hand, American soldiers still live in bases in Japan, as the only military defense for Japan. It's no surprise that Code Geass is an anime set in an alternate universe where Japan was taken over by the Western empire of Brittania. Britain and America must have teamed up to form one empire.

Japan was renamed Area 11. One of the elevens, Lelouch, was instated as an upper-class Brittanian. He holds a grudge against Brittania. However, after discovering a green-haired girl named C.C., Lelouch receives Geass, the power to control people to do whatever he wishes.

Although Code Geass is very fast-paced for a mecha anime, the back-to-back sequences of strategy-planning and robot fighting leads to some awesome action sequences. Lelouch also plays some clever strategies to lead his rebel army to defeat Brittanian robot armies. And the dialogue between Lelouch and his girl friends makes for some interesting comedy sequences.

Overall, part one is a great introduction to Code Geass, which could be the best anime of 2008. Hopefully part two is just as sweet.

By the way, Code Geass also features excellent bonus features. Each DVD features some extra scenes, with nifty picture slide shows and dialogue. And for fan service fans, disc two features a great fan service scene of all the Code Geass girls nude in a bathhouse. It's quite a guilty pleasure, indeed.",1231545600,,1667,5.003610108303249
3475749,5,B001AZ5IUG,"I've been watching anime for a long time.  When I was young, such classics as Mobile Suit Gundam and Macross/Robotech helped me form my opinions relating to what's good and not-so-good about a particular series.  More recently, Cowboy Bebop, Rahxephon, and Fullmetal Alchemist have aided in refining that opinion.

That being said, Code Geass now ranks at the top of my personal list of greatest anime series ever.  First, the series has a deep and complex story, with key plot twists coming at the perfect points in the series (think 24, but not quite as predictable).  The writers manage to fit more into 25 minutes than some hour-long shows in their alloted 45.  Personally, I think the ending to the series is the greatest I have ever seen.

Second, the characters themselves are very well developed.  Some take longer than others, but in the end, you feel a sense that you've gotten to understand where they all come from.  Besides that, they have personality to spare, which is refreshing.

Third, the mecha are outstanding.  Superbly drawn, well-articulated, and just plain fun to watch, they compliment the characters to a degree I personally haven't seen since Gundam Wing.  The biggest difference between Geass and Gundam is the fact that, whereas the Gundam gives it's pilot his/her personality, the character's respective Knightmare frame takes it's personality from the pilot  Finally, the music was nothing short of spectacular, which is just what I expect from anything coming from Sunrise.  For me, music helps make the series; if the music is sub-par, the series suffers greatly.

The series isn't flawless, though.  I was somewhat disappointed with the character art.  I agree fully with other reviewers when they say it looks like one basic body-design for the entire cast.  Some of the characters also have too much of an androgynous look to them, a recent trend of which I grow tired.  The facial expressions could have used some last-minute tweaking, also.  There are only so many times I can see a character with that classic wide-eyed, face-quivering, startled stare and not want to smack someone.

The bottom line is that this series has all the necessary requirements to go down on just about every anime fan's top 5 all-time-greatest list.  It has a very high watch-it-again factor that is no longer prevalent in the majority of anime and should definitely become a part of any fan's collection.",1227312000,,2422,4.972636815920398
3475750,5,B001AZ5IUG,"this comes with volumes 1&2, the first volume in the manga, 3 art booklets, and 2 CDs. very pretty box.",1225929600,,103,4.2
3475751,5,B001AZ5IUG,"I don't have the time to sit down and write a multi-paragraph review, but I'll state my opinions as briefly as possible.  There is no such thing as a series for everyone, but if action, comedy, drama, and a deep plot with many twists and turns sound good to you, you're sure to be one of the many people who love this series.  I've seen the whole thing and will attest to the fact that this is the beggnining of excellence.  To anyone who has seen or read Death Note, this is essentially a combination of that, and a very well done mecha.  As for the actual box itself, the dvds include the first 9 episodes of the series, there is the first of two soundtracks to the series (Excellent music also, by the way), the first drama CD, 3 informational books and an art book, not to mention the box itself, which is absolutely stunning.  All of this together is an amazing deal, and I highly recommend picking one up.  To anyone who does not know what a drama CD is, it is essentially extra back or side stories for the characters told through audio-only, like a radio broadcast of sorts, this adds even mroe depth to the series than already exists, and I love listening to it over and over.  As I said earlier, there is no such thing as a series for everyone, but as far as I can tell, this one comes REALLY close, as nobody I've shown it to has disliked it.  Happy Watching! :)",1225584000,4,1373,4.253846153846154

3475753,4,B001AZ5IUG,"In the very near future the country of England is now know as Britania:
They have taken over more then a third of the moderen world. Japan one of the last free countries has fallen and now is known only as Area 11. Her people are called (among nicer things)11's. Some of them have earned the right too becalled honary Britanians. Ofcourse  every Empire must deal with rebelion. This Empire is no exception. Various under ground fractions cause all kinds of ruckus-but it is consider petty annoyences-UNTIL.Enter a Leouch-a gifted(chess player) highschool student-who only cares for his handycaped sister & revenge on those who caused her handycaps. The same people who killed there mother-the Empire Britania. His best chance for revenge comes early on in the series when he is caught up in a terrorist supression. Trapped and facing what appears too be certain death,by firing squad. A strange mysterious green haired girl literally falls into his lap(shes shot).The acceptence of a bargin -and a transefer of power is made. Now Leouch can control minds(w/Geass) that are in line of sight. As he begins too learn the workings of his power-his planes for revenge are put in motion. Soon he developes a altanate personality know as Zero. Under this allias he begins too unite the various fraction & his goals become more then personal-now the Empire must come down so the people can be freed.
 This series is off too a good start lots of Mecha fighting(for mecha fans).The story so far is devoloping quite well as it explores issues of personal advance & mistrust among the upper class. Also the modern issues of  race, terrorism & how different classes veiw eachother. Unfortunetly the biggest draw back too this searies is the art. The back grounds are good to great-but the people for the most part look like stick figures. Almost like they used one basic body design for both men and women. Think of some of the older anime sci-fi like Star Blazers or for a newer reference Galaxy Railways. All in all though the series so far just barely slides into a 4 star spot(as a sci-fi/war series) and worth a veiwing or two.",1220400000,,2119,4.784153005464481

The first time I saw Code Geass I immediately fell in love with the characters and the story; I devoured Season Two within 2 days! Then, after experiencing such a powerful ending I just had to see how it all began. So I went and bought ALL of the first season DVDs. At the time of this review I have just 3 more episodes left to watch in season one, then I will have seen the whole the story from beginning to end. This first set of 5 episodes on DVD has very high re-watch value, as do both seasons so far. Every episode is well done. Character work and story design are brilliant; story is heavily character-driven. This is not your average Anime. If you haven't met Prince Lelouch, Knight Suzaku, and 'immortal witch' C.C. yet, you're missing out!
