8342350,4,B001TUJY0W,This was a gift - my granddaughter has enjoyed watching it.,1455667200,,59,4.454545454545454
8342351,4,B001TUJY0W,"I purchased YAY! PLANES for my 3 year old Niece, who loves airplanes. Watching this happy, fun video reminded me of my own youth and fascination with all things aviation. If you're a Pilot, buy an extra video to keep for your own collection. Will having YAY! PLANES reduce your aircraft insurance premiums? Probably not, but you'll have a grin on your face as you write the check!",1259539200,2,380,4.602941176470588
8342352,5,B001TUJY0W,"My 1 year old and 4 year old love to dance around to the songs on this DVD.  They request to watch it over and over.  Pick up a copy and your kids will be singing along to the NATO phonetic alphabet (you know...Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...)",1237852800,2,236,4.108695652173913
8342353,5,B001TUJY0W,"I have 2 sons, ages 3 and 5.  They absolutely LOVE this DVD.  They wake up in the morning asking to watch it.  We travel a lot, and so the boys have always been fascinated by planes.  As soon as we heard about the DVD we just had to have it.  Now every time we are on a plane they compare it to ""Yay! Planes.""  They love the NATO alphabet song ""How do you say, letters on an airplane,"" so much that my preschooler corrects his teacher and says, for example, ""That not A that's Alpha.""  They LOVE when Jim and Argyle talk about ""lift"" and how the plane is made of shapes.  And of course the boys love the military plane/air show sequences!  THANKS YAY! PLANES!",1237075200,4,659,4.125984251968504
8342354,5,B001TUJY0W,"This is a fantastic DVD for the little ones who are obsessed with airplanes, as well as those who are just getting into airplanes. This video takes preschoolers through all the shapes that make up an airplane while identifying the parts on a real airplane, and we get to fly up in the sky over farms and fields and mountains with a pilot in a small private plane.
One of the best parts are the sequences with Argyle and Jim, two socks who live in lost luggage! These puppet friends help us learn about the parts of an airplane, how a plane flies, and share the enthusiasm and curiosity that kids have for airplanes.
The music is another highlight. The kids will be singing the YAY! PLANES Theme Song long after the video is over. Also, the video goes through the alphabet using the NATO phonetic alphabet in a song called ""Letters on an Airplane""! Even moms and dads can learn their Alpha, Bravo, Charlie's!
From little planes to big planes, vintage warbirds, and military jets YAY! PLANES is fun for preschoolers and the adults who watch with them.",1236470400,2,1049,4.555555555555555
