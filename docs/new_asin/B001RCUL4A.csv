We taped most of the episodes and now our grandchildren are quoting Larry and Balki. It is a wholesome show. The kids learn a lot from Larry and Balki. It is a delightful show, no other like it. Have been waiting for years for this to be released.",1238544000,14,360,4.217391304347826
3774617,5,B001RCUL4A,"UPDATE - Season 3 can now be ordered from Warner Archive as a manufactured on demand DVD!

Seasons 3 and 4 of Perfect Strangers were truely masterpiece seasons. Although the first two seasons were good, Mark Linn-Baker and Bronson Pinchot really hit their stride as a comedic team in season three. The creative team was at the top of their form also - leading to some of the most memorable episodes in the series run, including Future Shock in which Larry dreams of where the gang will be in 30 years and Pipe Dreams in which the boys attempt a simple plumbing repair with disastrous results.

The show always had a great deal of heart and could make the audience feel on a deeper level than its slapstick roots would lead you to believe possible - such as in the episode Your Cheating Heart - in which a (mild) sex farce turns on a dime when we learn that Balki is the first best friend that Larry has ever had. The growing relationships between the characters are a joy to watch and appropriate for all family members to enjoy.",1235520000,59,1029,4.439153439153439
3774618,5,B001RCUL4A,"Perfect Strangers was a fabulous TV show suitable for kids and adults alike, which still retains its humor to this day. Season 3 had some of the best episodes: ""Just Desserts"" (the famous bibbibbka baking episode), and ""Pipe Dreams"" (Larry and Balki attempt to fix Jennifer's shower, with disastrous results)are two of the most memorable episodes of the series. Bronson Pinchot and Mark Linn-Baker were one of the best comedy teams of all time.

I was around 12 or so when the show started airing originallly, and watched it through my teens. I am watching it again 20 years later and it is still funny. It is a show you can watch with children without having to worry about explaining something you don't want them to know about; yet it is funny for adults who can relate to Balki and Larry's problems (falling in love, living with roommates, mean bosses, etc.) It really does have something for everyone.",1235433600,16,906,4.734177215189874

3774634,5,B001RCUL4A,"""In an article on TVShowsOnDVD.com regarding TV series with stalled DVD releases, it was mentioned that the main hold-up for any subsequent releases of Perfect Strangers is not poor sales but rather high music licensing costs.[8] It is noted that the series sometimes featured popular songs within certain episodes, though the versions by the artists who originally performed them were usually not used, instead they were commonly sung acapella by Mark Linn-Baker and/or Bronson Pinchot's characters whenever the script called for Balki and/or Larry to sing within the episode."" Source Wikipedia

I would be willing pay a much higher price in order to have the seasons be released.
It's better to have something available rather than nothing at all.
Or here's another idea ( if you want to keep the licensing cost down. ):
Why not just mute the audio where people sing and
have a disclaimer in the beginning of the video ( or documentation ) ""Because we don't live in a perfect world ..."".
The point is DO SOMETING!!!
I'm sure the fans will understand.

Just trying to help get the show released on dvd, blue ray, or streaming.

3774647,5,B001RCUL4A,"Please, please, pretty please release more Perfect Strangers DVDs!  Perfect Strangers was a hugely popular show that they even aired on Nick at Nite for a while.  In my opinion, that means that many American people held a warm spot in their hearts for Larry and Balki enough for a major cable network to syndicate it.  I would think that if a show were successful enough to make it 8 seasons on a major television network and a year or so on cable syndication it would do very well released on DVD for not only the original fans, but for an entire new generation of fans.  The first two seasons are just not enough for me.  Please whoever out there can help, bring the people more seasons of Perfect Strangers on DVD.  Thank you.",1337731200,5,729,4.402985074626866

3774650,5,B001RCUL4A,"WB what is wrong with you not releasing the rest of the series 3-8. I love this show it is the best comedy sitcome ever made and you WB are making us wait 4 what. Why don't you just release it as there are so many of us out here that are waiting for its release. Where to start there are so many classic and very funny episodes to choose from including Hunks Like us where Larry and Balki try to impress the girls buy overdoing it at the gym after a nap they cant walk. Then theres Snow way to treat a Lady where the Larry,Balki and the girls get snowed under by an avalanche and Larry and Balki have to dig there way out but Larry always knows best and digs around in a circle not even willing to listen to Balki(larry thinks he knows everything but somehow always lands himself in trouble. Pen Pal is one of my favourites where Balki without telling cousin Larry that he has invited an ex con to stay with them upon his release from jail(this was the guy that both Larry and Balki testified against 12months earlier and got him sent to prison)the look on Larrys face when he sees him in his apartment is unforgettable. Larry gets up during the night and hears the excon talking about shooting them first thing in the morning. Larry thinks its with a gun little does he know the the ex con has reformed and is starting work in a couple of days as a photographer it goes on from there. There are so many more episodes to mention i could go on all night. I just want WB to release the rest of the series there are so many of us out here just waiting,if only you knew how many. I give this sitcom 5 stars if 10 was available it would get 10. Best sitcom ever made. Just release the rest please. Aliens is very funny when Larry invites the girls to watch a Halloween movie marathon well the next morning Larry wakes up and sees giant pods in his apartment,sees Balki shoot a lazor beam from his finger and floating outside his apartment and everybody calls him cousin and is wearing vests. He thinks Balki has turned them all into aliens and that they are going to take over the earth. Tooth or consequence Balki has a sore tooth so a trip to dentist it is. When Larry lets the Dr look in his mouth first he has a hole in his tooth then the Dr tries to give him a needle(larry is petrified of needles)so gas it is. When he breaks the gas equipment Larry and Balki get high on the gas,Larry gives balki a shot(needle by accident)Balkis arm is num so Larry suggest to Balki that he can fix his tooth in which he tries to. Piano Movers moving a piano up 10 flights of stairs is pretty hard work especially when the boys start coming back down the stairs and the piano is following them. Balki thinks its alive,very funny episode. So all you fans out there let yourselves be heard and hopefully WB will listen to us and release the rest of the series.",1326844800,3,2844,4.201096892138939

I think I have close to 100 shows on video tapes, but someone borrowed a couple and I never got those back.  And I would rather not have to hook up my vcr tow atch the few tapes I do still have.  Blah.

So many great episodes.  I don't remember off hand which seasons I liked best though.  The episodes I remember right off are one where Larry and Balki have stress tests, another where they accidentally win an auction for a bottle of wine, one where some psychic makes a prediction, one where they live on a street sign, and one where Balki's stuffed animal is kidnapped.

Old school sitcoms like perfect strangers (season 3), and head of the class (season 1), and the WONDER YEARS( THE BEST FREAKIN SHOW EVER!) are taking forever to be released on dvd.  A lot of these older shows kinda started off slow and then reached their prime a few seasons in.  So the sales of the first couple of seasons sometimes aren't so hot and the damn studios just wind up canceling any further releases of later seasons.  These shows had quality, moral character, and talented actors and writers, but I guess on today's planet, no one gives a crap about that stuff anymore. Now all we have are awful trashy reality shows like meet the kardasians and jersey shore.  These shows are constantly being aired on tv, rerun after rerun, and people still go out and waste their money on the dvds.  Meanwhile, they rarely release shows that were taken off the air years ago which you cant watch unless there's a dvd.

3774672,5,B001RCUL4A,Seriously Warner Bros. I hate you. Release the rest of the Perfect Strangers seasons on DVD and somewhat redeem yourself for that Blu-ray incident.,1248048000,3,147,5.166666666666667
3774673,5,B001RCUL4A,Perfect Strangers is the best slap-stick/sarcastic comedy that you will ever find. PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3 ASAP!,1246320000,5,112,5.647058823529412
3774674,5,B001RCUL4A,"I can not wait until the rest of the series is released on DVD!! I, too, have all the episodes on VHS from when it was on TV and the quality is just so bad. I watch season 1 and 2 almost every night before bed. I can't get enough of Balki and Cousin Larry! With all the ""crap"" that is being released, this show was pure ""G"" rated entertainment.  Something I can share with my children is always a good thing! So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get the rest of the seasons released!!",1244419200,3,471,4.064516129032258
3774675,5,B001RCUL4A,"I have waited and waited for Perfect Strangers to be released on DVD.  On February 5, 2008, I bought my DVD along with others who waited as patiently as I did.  Now I am wondering when season 3 will arrive and why they are waiting so long for its release.  I remember when it was announced that PS was on DVD, PS was the ""hot pre-order"" and I was happy about that, thinking that season 3 was not far behind.  Well, I'm still waiting, and I'll continue to wait, because Perfect Strangers is that good.  Love love love that show.  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons.  There wasn't a bad one in the bunch.",1244419200,3,608,4.145299145299146
3774676,5,B001RCUL4A,"Fantastic show! What is going on with the release of the rest of the seasons? Does anybody know? Do they plan to release them? It isn't like they put tons of effort into the 1st 2 season DVDs so it can't be that it takes so long to put them together. Each season of ""3rd Rock"" came out a few months apart. The previous post is correct. Don't buy them from an unofficial source. They're junk if you get them at all.",1242086400,6,414,4.060975609756097
3774677,5,B001RCUL4A,"This has been arguably one of the greatest comedy productions of all times. It is meant for both children and adults alike and in many ways contains very basic messages which we tend to overlook in our every day lives. If you are someone who would loves entertainment, this is what you've been waiting for. If you have been part of the 80's and watched this show, trust me you would want to watch it all over again. And if you never stumbled upon this masterpiece, now is a good time to do so. Thumbs up to the creators and cast alike for providing an everlasting entertainment show.",1241654400,11,583,4.407407407407407
3774678,5,B001RCUL4A,"I bought the WB 1st & 2nd season-one of the best TV shows ever. But I got impatient and ordered the rest from one of Amazon's links: DVD TV (Smith DvD.com) and got taken. The quality is so poor; several discs are unusable, and it seems that not all the shows are on the discs, even though they claim they are. I'm remembering shows I watched but have not been on the discs. Caveat Emptor.",1239926400,29,388,4.1866666666666665

It was a 10 year wait to get more Balki and Larry, but the wait is finally over!!",1524960000,5,256,4.586956521739131

This show was WONDERFUL.,1524873600,,289,4.087719298245614
8337724,5,B001RCUL4A,I'm so glad Season 3 was finally released. It was one of my favorite shows. The picture quality is much improved over the Season 1 and 2 set. I noticed the opening sequence is missing on the third episode on disc 1. Not sure about the other discs tho. The original theme song is present as well. You have 5 seasons left to release WB. Let's get it done.,1524700800,8,353,4.130434782608695
8337725,5,B001RCUL4A,I was very surprised and excited to see that the season 3 of the show is finally out on DVD. I kept contacting Warner Brothers and got no response finally season 3 is on DVD this is a show that I watched as a kid and it brings great memories back of the days of TGIF. They just don't make shows like they used to. Hopefully they will make seasons 4 through 8 DVD soon,1524009600,4,367,3.9066666666666667
8337726,5,B001RCUL4A,"It's been ten years sense the first two seasons were release! Finally season 3 is here the season that has pipe dreams, just Deserts esa. Warner please release the remainder of this series  in a timely fashion, this last ten years if been way to long. This show was a favorite  from my childhood :)

Things to keep in mind these are basically homemade like discs but, the picture and sound are better the the season one and two release. although I don't understand why it's legal for film studios to do this. If it's done by anyone else it's jail time and a fine by Federal law.  I've been told everything in the Warner Brothers archive collection is Manufactured on demand though. The only down sides are this set has no Bonus Content and Discs two and three overlap in the case. The case is came in was warped and won't close correctly. So rather then return it I'll just buy a replacement case for it. The price is a little high for a (MOD) . Other then that it's all good.",1523836800,7,976,4.316939890710382
