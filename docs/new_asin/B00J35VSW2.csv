6329509,5,B00J35VSW2,I was a bit disappointed when I got this DVD because it is pretty much the same material as the Skeet Fundamentals DVD that I had only bought a month prior. If you are a beginner at skeet I recommend buying this DVD instead of the Skeet Fundamentals DVD. If you already own the Skeet Fundamentals DVD then it's a more difficult decision. I don't regret buying this since I am a beginner and want to grab all the fundamental knowledge I can to get up the learning curve quickly. This DVD has better video quality and a few other features that make it a better training aid than the earlier DVD.,1421884800,2,593,4.303571428571429

6329511,5,B00J35VSW2,"Outstanding DVD the best I have seen.  I waited until I was 70 years old to start shooting skeet and with Todd Bender my score has really improved.
The older group that I shoot with wanted to know if I was on some new medication.
Thanks Todd",1411689600,2,241,4.127659574468085

6329513,5,B00J35VSW2,"This is probably one of the best skeet videos available. Although it was produced years ago, it's still relevant and apparently has been updated. If you are interested in learning about the shotgun shooting games, you will enjoy the demonstrations and thorough explanations. There are also many demonstrations in proper form that help you improve your overall shooting ability. It's one for the library, you'll watch it more than once.",1407628800,,435,5.228571428571429

8647641,5,B00J35VSW2,"Todd Bender is that rare individual blessed with the combination of amazing raw talent and excellent teaching skills. I bought my first Bender video in the 1990's on VHS tapes. Even back then, the clear and concise manner of Bender's instruction style made learning skeet enjoyable and rewarding. His lessons combined the (then revolutionary) eye-cam perspective with the important learning points on hold point, break point, and eye placement at each high & low station. All of my shooting buddies back then also had his videos and we didn't just watch them, we absorbed them!

Recently I got back into skeet shooting after a multi-year absence to raise kids and make a career. Since I no longer own a VHS player, I decided to refresh my skeet skills by seeing if Bender's videos were still available commercially. Amazon made this easy! The latest version of Bender's skeet learning video is called  ""Todd Bender's Championship Skeet.""  It's on DVD now. The message is similar to the older VHS videos, but Bender has refined his teaching style even further. His once brown hair is now mostly gray, but the same teaching wisdom is there and even more refined.  Furthermore, the low-resolution VHS tapes of 1990's are now in 2015 High Definition eye-popping crisp resolution. It's fantastic!

Obviously, I totally recommend this DVD if you are interested in learning or improving your skeet game!",1438905600,,1396,5.025974025974026

8647644,5,B00J35VSW2,Excellent tutorial for a beginner. I learn more everytime I review certain chapters. Protocol for the eight stations are worth the cost alone.,1426723200,,142,5.217391304347826
