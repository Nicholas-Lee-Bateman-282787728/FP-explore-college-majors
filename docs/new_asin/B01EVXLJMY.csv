8759664,1,B01EVXLJMY,"Four couples vacation on Astral Island. Mimi who runs a hostel, informs them not to go beyond a sign...a place where no one comes back. Not too hard to figure out what they do. And they are attacked by the people on the cover.

The sound was uneven, and the camera worked could have been better. The lighting seemed off for much of the film. The acting and dialogue was laughable bad. I couldn't believe everyone screaming at each other while they were hiding...not that it attracted any attention. I couldn't understand the need to go out into the woods and look for sharp objects when they were in a house...steak knives anyone?
