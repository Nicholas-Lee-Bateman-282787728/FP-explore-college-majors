8572960,5,B00BR0J4PY,"Ivan Carter is literally the voice of hunting in Africa.  I enjoy his views on conservation and his knowledge on wild game from hard won experience.  The dvd is excellent, filled with dangerous game hunts and the more difficult trophies to collect.  My only complaint is the lack of ""common"" plains game of which there are several short selections.  Like all good things, it ended too quickly and the gun nut in me constantly wanting to hear more on guns and loads and the species they kill but overall there is enough of everything to make this an exceptional must see for the hunter blooded in Africa and those like myself who only dream of becoming so. . .",1430179200,,659,4.512605042016807
