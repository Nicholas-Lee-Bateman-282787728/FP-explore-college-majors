3484333,5,B001B63ZFO,"I purchased the Complete Training for Pinnacle Studio 11 and 12 and it helped me develop the expertise I needed to edit real estate videos quickly. It's absolutely one of the best investments I've made since I started my real estate company. Forget the structured classes; if you need training and Class on Demand has the course, BUY IT!  Absolutely the best and fastest way to learn! I just ordered the Advanced Course for Pinnacle Studio, and I'm beginning to think that using a real power NLE like Media Composer won't be that difficult with Class on Demand's help!",1221091200,3,568,4.737373737373737

Great training video. I learned alot before I received the video (trial and error). But I had not begun to see what I could really do, until I started watching the video. It is GREAT!!!!!!",1218585600,4,519,8.62962962962963
8281991,5,B001B63ZFO,Class on Demand has been good training for Pinnacle 12.  I have since up graded to Pinnacle 15 and the training applies to it as well.,1315526400,,134,4.153846153846154
8281992,5,B001B63ZFO,As a training professional this DVD is hard to beat. It is a great tool to get up and running. Only item I wish was that I could rewind portions of the session when I miss an item. It may be able to do that but I have not found it yet.,1294963200,,235,3.5384615384615383
8281993,5,B001B63ZFO,"I am a return customer to Class on Demand/Complete Training for Pinnacle Studio.
About one year ago I purchased Pinnacle Studio 12; shortly after that I purchased Complete Training for Pinnacle Studio 11-12 ( both DVDs) and they were great help, just as the reviews said.
Earlier this year I upgraded to Pinnacle Studio 14-Ultimate Collection. Because of my previous experience with the training DVDs, I bought Complete Training for Pinnacle Studio 14...it was the right decision. There is so much to this wonderful program that learning on my own would have taken too long.
The DVD arrived the other day(by the way, excellent service),I am not done watching yet, but, I have learned so much already.
The DVD is definitely worth the price and having the class right there at my fingertips any time I need it...priceless.
Just one thing on my suggestion list...I wish Pinnacle would have a ""spell check""; I know there is a solution with working in Word, copy and paste, and that is indeed what I need to get used to doing.
Thank you for the great lessons and the fun while learning.",1274659200,,1081,4.75531914893617
8281994,5,B001B63ZFO,This tutorial is well worth the money and is several hours long. It will for sure get you started in several things that Pinnacle Studio 12 can do!,1249948800,,147,4.285714285714286
8281995,5,B001B63ZFO,"Wow, I'm so glad I bought this DVD. I've have been a Pinnacle Studio 9 and 12 user for a three years. I've edited my videos by trial and error, and did a pretty good job. I couldn't believe the stuff I was missing by not watching this video first. And there are so many easier ways to edit things, when you learn the correct way. The instructions are so easy to understand. There is a lot of learn, take notes or watch it a few times.
If you own Studio 11 or 12, buy this video!
I bought mine from B&H, it was a little cheaper.",1246838400,,527,3.9345794392523366
8281996,4,B001B63ZFO,This DVD made me save much time on why Pinnacle was working in a certain way.  I understand it more and have learn who to make my movies nicer.,1244332800,,143,3.9310344827586206
8281997,5,B001B63ZFO,"Are you tired of trying to figure out Studio? Then get a copy of this DVD and watch the videos and learn how to master the program. These lessons are done very well and touch on all the key features of Studio. You also receive media files to use as you work through the lessons with the instructor. You will be a pro in no time.
I have watched my copy about 3 times.
SIDE NOTE: I have also found the Advanced Training product very helpful. Amazon sells it also.",1243900800,,461,4.133333333333334
8281998,4,B001B63ZFO,"I wish I had watched this tutorial when I first bought the Pinnacle studio 12. This tutorial taught me lots of short cuts and now I can save time and create a movie much faster. I have been using Pinnacle since past 5 years. However, I explored many hidden potentials only through this video. Consequently, I highly recommend this video training to be purchased along with the Studio 12.

I gave this a 4 and not 5 star because of two principle reasons:
(a) I was not able to play this video in my normal DVD player connected to my TV, my dvd player is not up to date.
(b) It would have been nice if common trouble shooting items were discussed on this training even though Pinnacle support is quite good for this. All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase and highly recommended to those who purchased or is looing forward to purchasing Studio 11 or a later version.",1241913600,,873,4.355828220858895
8281999,5,B001B63ZFO,"I recently ordered and am now using Pinnacle Studio's 12 Ultimate.  I've been very satified so far with that product.  Although I have used other video editing programs in the past (Media Studio Pro), there were still some things that I was not familiar with in the Pinnacle program.  I ordered the training DVD at the same time as the program and am very glad that I did.  Paul Holtz is able to describe and show exactly how to perform certain skills using the program.  I found him to be clear and concise in his narrations.
The DVD was most helpful when I just needed to go back and quickly find out how to do something versus digging thru the program ""help"" or referrring back to the manual.  It makes it much easier to ""see"" how something is done versus reading about the operation in a manual.
I would recommend this product to any new users of the program, or for folks that would just like to quickly apply some of its' more advanced techniques.",1236124800,3,953,4.417142857142857
8282000,5,B001B63ZFO,"For a very un artistic guy-this helps a great deal and is very well laid out. Worth the money for sure. Maybe someday I'll make a real movie. Unfortunately all I can think of after watching this is how to make a comedy...
