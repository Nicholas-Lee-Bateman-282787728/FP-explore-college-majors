--------------------------
Parzania is a skilfully told story about the 2002 Gujarat riots from the perspective of a lower-middle class Parsi family living in in one of Ahmedabad's colonies that were attacked by a mob of rioters. Witnessing these unfortunate incidents along with them is an American student who is in Gujarat to study Gandhi. . All the actors have done a wonderful job, even those cast for 2/3 scenes. Sarika's performance is especially commendable considering that this was her comeback after an 18 year hiatus from acting (she wound up winning the national award for her performance in this movie). The movie itself won a national award for the best picture.

Amazon mentions the language as being ""Gujarati"". Do not let this deter you from purchasing the DVD. Most of the dialogues are actually spoken in English with a few Hindi dialogues here and there and even fewer Gujarati dialogues.

DVD Review (2/5)
------------------------
Unfortunately, the DVD is poorly mastered. The video is average in quality which is fine for an indie film; but the audio is unacceptably poor. Throughout the movie, we hear a mildly frustrating echo of every dialogue and every sound. I feel there should have been at least some post-processing done on the audio before mastering the DVD. One could argue that, this being an indie-movie, perhaps the original film was shot with low quality equipment; but that is hard to believe for a movie with a budget of $700,000 .

There are no extra features such as making of the film or director/cast/crew commentary track in the DVD. This, I feel, is a huge omission since people who like the movie enough to purchase the DVD, would also love to know what went into making this film.

Verdict
-----------
Considering all the drawbacks of the DVD, I would still have to recommend the DVD; not for the quality of the DVD transfer but for the brilliance of the movie itself.",1479513600,,1935,4.890243902439025
