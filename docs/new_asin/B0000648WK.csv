7960693,3,B0000648WK,"To correct something said by another reviewer, Hajime Yatate is actually a pseudonym for Sunrise staff members.  The studio involved with this were probably not even involved in some of the other titles mentioned.  Alot of the is based on Jungian symbolism and is not for every one, but its good if you are familiar with certain themes similar to Ergo Proxy.  It looks a bit dated even by 90s standards, but part of it was they were going for a certain look that complimented the themes.  This is especially true of the animus motif in the series.  I don't like dubs of most anime and so I don't really judge anime that way, but for those who do, I can see how this is not as strong as other dubs.  I wouldn't compare this to Gundam or Cowboy Bebop as they are not the same artist (in fact its not even one artist) nor do they share much on theme or genre.  I would compare this (as I did earlier) to things like Ergo Proxy, Paranoia Agent, and BoogiePop Phantom.  If you like those, you would probably like these.",1427414400,,1014,4.3
7960694,5,B0000648WK,"I'd forgotten how old this anime was. If you like freaky, old-school, giant robots, and creepy science then this is definitely an anime for you. It's a wonderful blend of introspective psychology and creative science that seriously should not be watched at night. I used to watch this when I was little and I'll never be able to look at udon the same again because of it.",1247356800,,371,4.552238805970149
7960695,3,B0000648WK,"I think this show is alright. The show has a formula, it's pretty much the same structure every episode. Each time an enemy falls, a new one pops up. I've been watching every episode since the first (I'm on the 26th episode) and many things are still unclear. The plot is constantly changing, and not necessarily in a good way. It's pretty random. I don't care much for the characters; Sakura annoys me a lot. She whispers warnings but no one seems to hear her. She just seems so useless most of the time. Anyway, this show is only mildly interesting. I got bored halfway through, but I continued to watch. This DVD is pricey, as most are. It's much more than it's worth. I wouldn't buy the DVDs, but then again I'm broke. Watch if you can do it cheap or for free, not if you have to pay a significant amount.",1091836800,2,809,4.294117647058823
7960696,3,B0000648WK,"**REVIEWING IT AS A WHOLE SERIES**
Hajime Yatate is one of most top leading creators in the anime industry, best suited for the mecha-action genre.  He gave us animes like 'Cowboy Bebop', 'The Big-O', 'Mobile Suit Gundam'...and on this review, ""Betterman"", an anime that hybrids mecha-action with the knowledge of genetics.  I'll be frank:  ""Betterman"" ain't Yatate-san's best work.
""Betterman"" deals with an obligatory virus that kills people and monsters that lurk in the shadows, so a secret organized alliance goes to investigate and exterminate these problems using 'top-of-the-line' robots made for combat.  The main characters are 'Keita', the cowardice nerd with an electronic-fetish, and his childhood friend 'Hinoki', a generic hot chick with an ugly neon-mixed hairdo who has some serious self-esteem issues, along with a bunch of sub-characters that almost no one's going to care about. Though their roles are strong, they wouldn't succeed in many battles against half-screened monsters if it wasn't for the help of the mysterious guy who could transform into an enormous, metallic demon named, yep, Betterman; I always ponder that the mystery dude and Hinoki are connected somehow, because he almost has the same ugly hairdo as she does.
The series is interesting when it come to what it is.  Though it follows the mecha genre, it does have some horror-quality to it because of some of the Silent Hill-type, psychological scenes it contains.  Story-wise, it's convoluted.  If you can't pay attention to the whole thing, you'll be just as confused and lost as I was, as the characters spend a lot of time theorizing, explaining, and yapping about how to create different species through genetics, the history on the virus and the birth of monsters like Betterman, stuff that'll guarantee you to be mind-boggled.  Even if you paid attention to the series entirely, you'll realize that it has problems.  The series' consist of plot holes, imbalance plot structure, and it'll leave many questions unanswered when the series ends.
The art and animation of the series are on the so-so side, but what's more aggravating is that the series is very dim.  I can hardly see what's going on in certain scenes, and how can I enjoy a battle between a robot and a demon IF I CAN'T SEE EITHER OF THEM?!  The dubbing is a mixed bag, as the characters' voices ranges from loose to forced acting; I mean, hearing them laugh is a shivering experience.
""Betterman"" is by no means a bad show, but if Yatate want to create something that's at the top of league as his other creations, he needs to think of a 'better' anime, a 'better' production, and a 'better' outro; the guy who's singing the outro sounds like he had flu while being constipated.
It's a must-buy for hardcore anime fans who wants a bit of a psychological feel on the mecha-action/horror variation, but others might want to pass on this one.  It's a decent anime at best, but overshadows from even greater ones.",1069200000,2,2969,4.9397590361445785
7960697,4,B0000648WK,"This is a very good anime in the lines of Evangelion mixed with horror. What is so surprising about the show is how truly creepy and even scary it can get. The third episode would have to be my favorite, at least out of this bunch, because of its Twilight Zone feel to it. Another surprising aspect of the show was the fact that a major story arc was actually completed within the first 5 episodes, this rarely happens in anime. There are still some down sides to the series. One of these is the character designs, Keita Aono is really to nerdy looking and, strangely enough, all the girls have extremely large breasts. I am used to both aspects within an anime, but not in a horror. These strange character designs keep me from truly feeling the horror in every strange situation. Another serious problem is my inability to relate to any of the characters, at least within the first 5 episode. Then again, I would buy the series just for the closing theme song.",1035417600,,962,4.471590909090909
7960698,4,B0000648WK,"I think this series is great so far. It's action-packed and the characters are interesting. There's comedy and suspense, and big robots, but not TOO many big robots. It has a storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to know more.
I've seen the first two dvd's (10 episodes) and I'm anxiously awaiting the third volume to see what happens next. I recommend this series to anyone who appreciates a good, quality anime. I hope that in the future more people become familiar with this title because it deserves more fans.",1029715200,4,522,4.747252747252747
