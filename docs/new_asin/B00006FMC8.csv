7968019,5,B00006FMC8,"What beauty, and what a pleasure to watch!  Narrated by Linda Hunt's articulate voice, this film is full of fantastic underwater scenes that took a great deal of talent, and patience, to capture.  A real treat that my entire family appreciated.

7968020,3,B00006FMC8,"Nicely filmed, good sea and island bird life coverage including the seasonal El Nino effects, BUT...the narration is often drowned out by the sound track's musical score--a fault I lay directly on the studio sound staff, sloppy mixer level management, and asleep-at-the-wheel Quality Control people.  The narration overall was only ""adequate"" as the woman doing it spoke as if ""too removed/uninterested/laid back"" from what she was narrating, a weak script to read from, and spoken softly as well adding to the narration shortfall.  Otherwise...this is visually a good DVD of the sea and bird life of the Cocos Islands.",1169251200,2,619,5.242424242424242
7968021,5,B00006FMC8,"Island of the Sharks is a spectacular look at the ocean around the island of Cocos. Many creatures are photographed here, including: shark species, manta rays, fishes, and quite a few invertebrates. A very startling scene, and one of my favorites, involves a male blenny searching for a mate. However, a very large mantis shrimp threatens all fishes that pass within the area. A female blenny detects the males signal, and searches the sand flats for him. When the tiny female reaches the male, he rebuffs her instantly. The female blenny backtracks in the wrong direction, and is swallowed whole by the waiting shrimp. Excilirating photography! However, this is only a single scene out of many that make this one of the very best films about the ocean. Completely trashes another well known but sub par Imax film called ""The Living Sea.""

 The transfer to DVD of this epic is acceptable. It is very good for a restoration from the Imax screen, which is usually very hard to do. Some scenes of the film are grainy, but this is expected from an Imax restoration. However, most of the picture is clear, and can be enjoyed in full glory. If you love the ocean and it's marvels, rent it or buy it on DVD!",1090281600,14,1200,4.629107981220657
7968022,5,B00006FMC8,I buy and watch a lot of underwater documentaries but I have to admit this is but far the best of them so far. Cocos Island has always been my dream diving spot in the world. These guys put together a fantastic video. Quality of the shots are incredible. I strongly recommend anyone who is interested in underwater life.,1079395200,8,320,4.440677966101695
7968023,3,B00006FMC8,"When I pounce on a DVD titled ""Island of the Sharks,"" I expect your typical documentary footage of film crews going into shark cages underwater, and luring sharks to break the surface and chomp on sides of beef dangled over the side of the boat. That didn't turn out to be the case here.
A better title for this DVD might have been simply ""Cocos Island,"" because while the hammerheads of this island are shown, they are by no means the main attraction. It's a good documentary in and of itself, with amazing IMAX photography and a look at the many varities of marine life that inhabit the coral reef around the island. It just wasn't what I was expecting, based on the title.",1060128000,19,675,4.451612903225806
