8632612,2,B005G7WGMW,"I agree with the other review, this dvd is a true disappointment!!! There are many issues with it:

* According to the title here and the DVD case, it's a 2011 production... FALSE! that is simply a misleading statement! it may have been compiled this year, but the performances are from many years ago! just to give you an idea, Zoe still doesn't have her lateral belly tattoo, Kami has bangs in her hair, and the grapes in Jill Parker's tattoo look very purple!... sounds like a funny reference, but it's useful if you are a true fan... if not, I can say these recycled performances have at least 5 years, if not more.

* I have many many performance compilations such as this, and it's normal to have a few performances in a DVD that you can pass, but at least have a couple that make it worth keeping... not the case here, people... even though there are big dancers included (Zoe Jakes, Mira Betz, Elizabeth Strong, Kami Liddle), they look like they still hadn't fully developed their own style... and the rest are just boring, cliche or embarrassing (just because you have the clothes and the jewlery, doesn't mean you can be part of a serious production to be commercialized!).

* This dvd belongs to Hollywood Music Center, and as a serious company I consider it's unprofessional and disrepectful with their customers that they don't pay enough attention to at least choose performances with different music!!!

In short: not worth the money, the expectations or your time watching it... save yourselves the disappointment and look for the promo video on youtube, it's under the dvd's name, and you'll see what I mean...  I hope I can still return it!",1321833600,4,1658,4.683848797250859
8632613,3,B005G7WGMW,I had high hopes for this dvd but it came across as amateurish. It was filmed around same time as the other performance dvds. Zoe Jakes and Ava Fleming dance to same song in different performances. Mira Betz unfortunately performs a whirling Dervish routine which is very boring. Who wants to see some spin in circles? The other performances were very good though.,1320537600,,364,4.7936507936507935
