But, I am glad that I purchased it.  It was worth buying.  I am a huge Jason Priestly fan,that was one of the reasons why I bought the movie.  I was not disappointed.  It was great.  I love the golf scene at the end.  That was hysterical.  I recommend this movie.  It is light and airy.  Not to serious.  There are some touching scenes between the Father and Jason Priestly, that are nice.  I like the guy who plays the Father.  He was good.  I like the whole cast, they all worked well together.  I thought Peter Dobson was great.  That guy says the funniest things.  His facial expressions were great.  Buy this movie, you won't be disappointed. I don't know why the guy at the bottom only gave it 1 star.  It was better than that.  I don't know what movie he was watching.",1056240000,2,927,4.2011494252873565
