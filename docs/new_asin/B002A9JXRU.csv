8359117,1,B002A9JXRU,"Oh lord, where do I begin? Amateurish, unconvincing, and doesn't explain anything beyond ""The Secret."" In fact, it tells you a lot less. If you want to learn more on Law of Attraction or how to change your life I suggest watching ""Beyond Belief"" in stead, or just going on youtube and looking up Abraham-Hicks, but don't waste your money or time on this.",1334188800,,354,4.546875
8359118,1,B002A9JXRU,"First and foremost, to try and say that this movie takes up where ""The Secret"" left off is rubbish. I applaud them for attempting to inform others about Law of Attraction, but the real secret behind ""The Secret"" is very simple. In ""The Secret""they ommitted telling us this secret, because they didn't feel the general public was ready to hear this: YOU ARE SOURCE ENERGY (GOD) IN A PHYSICAL BODY, AND YOU ARE A VIBRATIONAL BEING LIVING IN A VIBRATIONAL UNIVERSE. Without that understanding, trying to apply the Law of Attraction is futile! If anyone is really interested in understanding the true meaning of the LAw of Attraction, check out the Abraham material/ Esther Hicks.[...]",1300147200,,681,4.930434782608696
8359119,1,B002A9JXRU,"I bought this movie for my wife as a birthday gift along with ""What the Bleep do we know?""....I should have stopped @ ""What the Bleep"". Beyond the Law of Attraction was a low budget, boring, and unconvincing movie. I also found it laughable that they are comparing themselves to ""The Secret"" in this movie. When I watched ""The Secret"" @ ""What the Bleep"" they both were very interesting and thought provoking. The only thought provoking that was going on with this movie was ""why in the heck am I watching this crap?"" Save your time and money.",1289347200,,542,4.540816326530612
8359120,5,B002A9JXRU,"This movie is a great addition for any LOA disciple.  It has some very powerful speakers who have managed to give a different slant.  What I like most is that this movie makes clearer than ever the fact that life will still continue to offer contrast, but it really is about taking responsibility for that contrast. Beyond any physical or material pursuit you may have (which is fine and valid), it really is a spiritual journey.",1243987200,,429,4.631578947368421
8359121,5,B002A9JXRU,"This movie is the real deal.....it features a woman who faces what we all face in life--setbacks and disappointment.  Beth and Lee are two of my favorite LOA coaches, and who better to address this situation for us all?  They successfully live what they teach, and it's obvious.  Presented in a happy, joyful, and positive light.  It reinforces the facts for those of us who practice LOA, and sheds incredible information and hope for those of you just learning!  I loved the guests!  Each added something unique and thought-provoking......it was like a breath of fresh air!  Just what I needed to keep me motivated and on track!",1243987200,2,629,4.822429906542056
8359122,4,B002A9JXRU,"First off, I noticed another reviewer didn't care for this movie. I wonder if someone who wrote a glowing review for ""A Gentlemen's Guide To Seduction"" should be commenting on ""Beyond the Law of Attraction."" Regardless, here are my thoughts.

This movie helped me to understand what ""The Secret"" didn't tell me, which made it worth every penny. Also, it is much more accessible and the people in the movie each had something great to add. Guy Finley, who's written a lot of bestselling books relating to this subject, really stands out. And Beth and Lee McCain are very knowlegeable and likeable, too. All in all it was really enjoyable, and I'd give it a FOUR.",1243900800,2,661,4.698275862068965
8359123,4,B002A9JXRU,A more subdued version than the Secret but has valuable information that any LOA person can use.  There were many points that got my attention that I hadn't thought of when using the Law of Attraction and I loved Guy Finley. He always has a great message.  I appreciated Beth and Lee MCain being down to earth.  This is a great edition to my LOA DVD collection.,1243900800,,361,4.358208955223881
8359124,1,B002A9JXRU,"I stopped this dvd minutes before it ended because I couldn't bear putting up with the hokey, repetitive type of gibberish. I mean I bought the dvd because I am and have been open to positive thinking. But this video tries to get attention by saying it's a more detailed version of ""the secret"". But it states the same thing just in a different way. None of the guest speakers are credible. It was poorly narrated and kind of corny in the way they present positive thinking. The main speaker talks as if she knows so much about who, or in her view ""what"" God is I felt embarresed to have ordered this video. Watching it almost made me question the real power of positivity. It could be that the people are sincere in their mission to teach but it didn't work in this dvd, sorry.",1243555200,,778,4.335616438356165
8359125,5,B002A9JXRU,"Don't be fooled by the relaxed casual beginning to this movie. Beth and Lee McCain have put together a powerful, entertaining accurate account of how we can deliberately apply this incredible law to our lives. Regardless of your previous understanding of the law of attraction you will find a featured guest who you will understand and connect with. I was personally very moved with the taped footage of a Napolean Hill interview while my husband found a new understanding listening to Oren Harris...definitely something for everyone.
  This movie is jam packed full of great information on how we can improve our lives, and it's great entertainment...a win win.  Enjoy!",1242691200,3,670,5.128440366972477
