8510940,5,B000MR9D0O,"Sandy's approach to getting started is terrific. Beginning with ballet positions, showing how to do them properly, gives you a great basis for your posture. Without good posture, you run the risk of getting injured while excercising. If you are a person that does not excercise, have been injured, or are older this first video is a perfect way to get you back in the game and feeling good about yourself. The stretching at the beginning is always recommended before beginning any cardio work. The seven or so minutes of cardio is just perfect to get your heart rate up without wearing you out so that you cannot continue. The final ""cool down"" is a neccessity for any excercise routine. The entire length of the workout is approximately 25 minutes and is a great start to any bodies day.
I appreciate that the people in the background are not ones that teach workout for a living and that I can relate to them. It allows me to feel silly if I make a mistake and that I to can keep going.
This is a great way to get yourself in shape. I look forward to the next one that I hear is currently released.",1201219200,4,1100,4.397058823529412
8510941,1,B000MR9D0O,"Sandy starts out by demostrating the five basic ballerina positions of which only the first two are used in the video.  The ""warm-up"" is simply breathing and stretching, no cardio movemements to get the heart rate up.  The cardio section where you actually get your heart rate us is a mere 7 minutes in length. The ""cool down"" is more stretching. The filming is very unprofessional.  For 95% of the workout portion of the video you only see Sandy from the waist up and the people standing behind her appear to be ""people off the street"" because you can tell by watching them (which is the only way you know what movement to do) that they have no knowledge of what's going to happen next or how to do a particular move. Very disappointing video from someone who could have done an outstanding job.",1186617600,13,796,4.513888888888889
