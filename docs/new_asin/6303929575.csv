734624,5,6303929575,My family has watched this film numerous times and never grow tired of it. It is very well done. A tale well told. Fun and actually teaches a few things along the way. Patrick Swazey is terrific in this movie. We love it.,1054857600,7,221,4.162790697674419
734625,5,6303929575,"This movie grows on me more and more each time I watch it. It would be worth watching just for spectacular scenes like John Henry holding back a locomotive single-handed, or Pecos Bill lassoeing and riding a twister. It has more, though. It has the Code of the West ( Respect the land, defend the defenseless, and never spit in front of women or children.) It also has the message to never let ""progress"" bulldoze the dream of what is right, and good, and true.

  It used to confuse me that the West was embodied in Pecos Bill, the North in Paul Bunyan, and the South in John Henry, while the East was unrepresented. Then it hit me. The East is represented by the villains, the frock-coated, carpet-bagging, Yankee reptiles that are out to destroy the land. After all, as the chief villain points out, there is no Code of the East- only Profit at any cost....

  Alot of this film isn't exactly ""politically correct."" It actually shows, fighting, gun-toting, drinking, and cigar smoking. Why, if a youngster was to watch it, there is some small chance that he might actually grow up to be a ...MAN!",1035590400,41,1099,4.553299492385787
734626,5,6303929575,"Lot's of action to keep my husband awake.  A wonderful excursion through several legendary names ie:Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, John Henry ect. This movie does a great job of presenting solid values like Honor, Trust, Doing  the right thing, and commitment.  I also found that this movie did an  excellent job of avoiding the traps of foul language and sex. There is  fighting and shooting, old west style.  It doesn't get gorey or out of  proportion to the storyline.  All around as a conservative Christian mother  I must say that this is a wonderful movie for the whole family.",947289600,59,577,4.747474747474747

734731,5,6303929575,"This is perhaps one of the most underrated films of all time. It is clean, family friendly, and most definitely American to its core. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why the critical reviewers based in New York and other bastions of liberalism and anti-American sentiment can't stand this film. If you want to raise your kids right, have them watch this film and memorize it.  Traditional American values and morality are embodied here, and both Stephen Lang and Patrick Swayze give memorable performances.

It was a fun movie to watch with action and comedy that, as a child, was all I needed. I didn't understand until years later the impact that the values taught had on me and my attitudes in life. Children today need to watch movies like this to learn about values and attitudes described in ""the code of the west""-""Respect the land, defend the defenseless, and don't never spit in front of women or children.""",1476921600,,505,4.382978723404255

735274,4,6303929575,"I use this film as the culmination of the Tall Tales unit that I teach fourth and fifth grade ESL students. The kids enjoy it and are quick to point out the similarities and differences between the stories they've read about John Henry, Paul Bunyan and Pecos Bill. Patrick Swayze does a nice job and since he's a native Texan, his accent is just right. I did hope that Paul Bunyan and John Henry had bigger personalities like in the original stories, but they are still compelling characters. The kids are relieved that John Henry survives this story.
It is a ""Fantasy Western"" from 20 years ago so it does feature a little more gun violence than newer films for this age group, it's more ""Fanciful"" and not graphic or bloody...but Pecos does ""shoot off"" the trigger fingers of his foes as is the tradition of his Tall Tale. That's just a ""Trigger warning"", if you will, in case you are sensitive to violence in any form. (Nobody really dies or anything).",1455148800,4,955,4.558139534883721

I  didn't  quite  understand  what  was  going  on  until  the  meeting,  &  that  guy  whoever  he  is  there  trying  to  persuade  people  to  sell  him  their  land  to  extend  the  railroad  track  through  paradise  valley.  If  you  like  your land  don't  consider  selling.  So  the  boy  quickly  learns  how  his  father  feels,  &  runs  away  with  the  deed.  I'll  say  this  the  movies  good,  but  don't  expect  a  huge  old  giant  of  Paul  Bunyan  like  in  the  cartoon.  Patrick Swayze  is  Pecos  Bill  in  the  movie,  but  I  think  the  mustache  he's  wearing  is  fake.  To  me  though  he  looks  silly,  he  makes  a  pretty  good  cowboy  that  can  almost  make  you  laugh,  then  Oliver  Platt  stars  as  Paul  Bunyan,  he  is  strong  &  a  perfect  character  for  the  movie,  he  really  only  looks  around  6  ft.  7''  though.  Good  costumes  by  the  way.  John  Henry  is  also  impressive,  as  he  tries  to  beat  the  machine.  He  almost  did,  &  Daniel  Hackett  after  being  warned  by  Pecos,  (Stay  away  from  the  horse  or  he'll  kill  you),  doesn't  take  long before  Widow Maker  makes  an  acception  for  Daniel  as  a  friend,  &  winning  the  horses  respect  to  where  he'd  allow  Daniel  to  pet  him.  Like  every  movie  I've  watched  before  the  parts  are  impressive.  I  liked  the  criminal  played  by  Scott Glen  who  stays  on  their  trail  no  matter  where  they  go.  I  know  how  it  all  seems,  Daniel  falling  asleep  &  drifting  away  in  the  boat  &  ending  up  in  the  desert.  &  then  him  ending  up  back  in  the  boat  again  near  his  home,  it  wasn't  a  dream,  &  I  don't  believe  he  magically  got  sent  back  in  time  or  into  the  future,  but  the  legend  his  father  told  him  does  come  to  life.  They  all  did  a  perfect  Job  of  assisting  Daniel.
&  he  learned  that  your  own  land  can  be  worth  much  more  than  any  amount  of  money  no  matter  how  much  ones  offering.
I  think  whether  or  not  its  a  family  or  an  audience  that  watched  this,  they  would  most  likely  be  cheering!
To  me  its  worth  the  enjoyment! There  should  of  also  been  a  cartoon  about  Pecos  Bill,  which  I  remember  seeing  years  ago  back  in  the  80's,  on  the  every  day  Disney  cartoons.
I  also  saw  Paul Bunyon.  I  don't  remember  seeing  John  Henry.
There  should  have  been  a  cartoon  movie  about  all  3  of  them  something  we  do  remember.",1448755200,,2687,4.225806451612903

735607,5,6303929575,"Daniel Hackett is a 12-year-old boy who's fed up with farm life.  In a place called Paradise Valley which resembles Colorado and Wyoming, his dad's farm is the only barrier to a railroad coming through.  The railroad executive has long hair like Buffalo Bill and is ruthless and seeks to kill Daniel's dad to get the deed to the farm.  Daniel escapes to the boat by his farm and falls asleep.  When he wakes up, he is in a desert being threatened by bandits and gets rescued by Pecos Bill, whose existence he had scoffed about when his father would tell him stories.  He later meets Paul Bunyan and John Henry.  It is really fun experiencing the individual personalities and sparring by these 3 superheroes.  Daniel continues to be pursued by the railroad executive J. P. Stiles even in this fantasy adventure which explores archetypes of the American West.  The themes it presents, of individual courage, loyalty, and hard work, are really common in entertainment, but the ending of the movie has a twist which I find really exhilarating.  It always makes me wonder how much of the fantasy elements are supposed to be real in the story and how much they're just symbolic of Daniel's coming-of-age.  (You might not understand that sentence unless you've seen the movie.)  Besides some similarities to The Wizard of Oz, there are also some similarities to Biblical stories like Elijah leaving his mantle to Elisha as he gets taken to heaven and people standing alone against tyranny and injustice with the support of God, who gets invoked in this movie just before the deus ex machina plot device at the end.  The orchestral music by Randy Edelman is a special experience for me.  So is the vivid cinematography, just as effective at night as day, by Janusz Kaminski, who's been primarily associated with Steven Spielberg.  This movie is a ""western fantasy"", and embraces its individual identity enthusiastically.  It also has enough variety of landscape to maintain interest.",1427414400,3,1975,4.888888888888889

Sometimes what your heart wants and yearns for isn't good for you.

I read a previous review from a teacher who shows it 2nd-4th graders.  I would be outraged if this movie was show to my 2nd-4th grader at school.  My kids happen to be in 2nd and 4th grade and they were very afraid of some of the situations, especially in the scene where the boy meets the two vagrants before Pecos makes his first appearance (not only are the characters disgustingly seedy, Pecos proceeds to shoot one of their fingers off!).  Other reviews said there is no foul language, which I took to mean there was no foul language.  There are several bad words used repeatedly (a*s, he*l, da*n).  Not at all what I expected based on the glowing reviews.  I recommend previewing the movie before showing it to your kids if they are younger.  I wish we had.",1385510400,,900,4.60377358490566

What I failed to fully realize before purchasing this dvd, was the fact that it is a european disk, therefore it will not play or work with U.S dvd players due to coding differences.

But beware of the location in which is it shipped from, and look on the case before opening to see if it says ""euro"" anywhere on it.

I guess that would make Nick Stahl Dorothy, Oliver Platt would be the Cowardly Lion, Patrick Swayze the Scarecrow, Roger Aaron Brown the Tin Man, Scott Glenn the Wicked Witch of the West, the steampunk thugs would be the flying monkeys....
They did overplay the ""it was just a dream"" gimmick a bit much.  That, and Stahl continuously saying ""I just want to get home.""  Either this kid was prone to some very disturbing dreams or he was a nut and should be confined to the farm.  Within minutes of his falling asleep 2 old coots argue over who gets to kill him.  ""Can I shoot him between the eyes?""  Yes, guns are drawn and aimed at the boy's head.  This is a Disney film?!  I lost count of the number of times people tried to kill this boy...in and out of his dreams!  Despite Patrick Swayze's constant cackle, I saw nothing even remotely amusing about this dark cautionary tale.  There was a lot of snapping and snarling, knife welding lunatics, even motorcycles were used to try and run the boy down (not to mention being run over by a train!).  This was a dark and nasty piece of work made only worse because it carries the Disney brand.  I don't know why anyone would call this a movie suitable for all ages; maybe they thought constant threats of death were perfectly acceptable.

Two things I would think about before watching the movie though:

1) Children can just watch the movie and enjoy it, but they will get so much more out of it if they know the tall tales behind the characters-Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, John Henry, Calamity Jane.

2) There is some violence in the movie.  Not violence for violence sake, and no blood spurting, but definitely guns and punching in the manner of the ""Old West"" movies of the 50's.",1275782400,21,686,4.491935483870968

736613,4,6303929575,"I expected some sort of supernatural-type hero story with he likes of Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan and Jhn Henry, but this movie was more like a regular adventure. It reminded me, in some respects, of an adventure out West such as ""White Fang."" It was that kind of story.

The kid in here, ""Daniel Hackett,"" played by Nick Stahl, was a little annoying for awhile, the typical snotty kid they like to show in the movies, but came to his senses by the end and wound up a decent kid who respected the people he was supposed to respect.

Meanwhile, all the characters including bad-guy ""J.P. Stiles"" (Scott Glenn) were a lot of fun to watch and hear, with some good dialog. Patrick Swaze was a hoot as ""Pecos Bill"" and Oliver Platt equally fun as ""Paul Bunyan,"" and who doesn't admire big ""John Henry"" (Roger Aaron Brown)?

It took all the way up to late 2008 for this to be available on DVD, but then it comes out in a formated-to-TV ratio instead of the 2.35:1 it should be. I won't buy it, now.  Oh, well, it's still a fun movie - pure escapism for more than just kids.",1241136000,,1063,4.3

736616,2,6303929575,"TALL TALE has the potential to be an excellent film.  The possibilities of a tall tale adventure with Pecos Bill, Calamity Jane, Paul Bunyan, and John Henry should be great.  This isn't.
The two stars I gave it are for two performances that head and pretty good cast and the music by Randy Edelmen (the genius behind GETTYSBURG's score).  Patrick Swayze is an excellent actor, and now I fully appreciate his ability to turn a complete dud of a role into gold.  He takes the role of Pecos, a shallow character, and steals every moment onscreen.  When he flies in and out of his tornado, you don't even glance at the larger-than-life twister because you're mesmorized by Swayze.  He's excellent.
The other good acting is by Stephen Lang (also from GETTYSBURG) in a brief role as the hero's dad.  The music is amazing.
The film starts off engaging enough, but slowly deteriorates down to cheesy plot and dialouge.  Many of the scenes toward the end made me laugh out loud because of their predictable nature.  Other negative things are often choppy visual effects and incomplete shots.
Nice try, but the film fails.",1210809600,,1112,4.75

736716,5,6303929575,"In ""Tall Tale"" you have all the makings of a classic story.  There is a very appealing, nave young hero, who overcomes huge obstacles to right a terrible wrong, at great personal risk and potential loss.  You have a greasy, sharp tongued villain and a herd of similar henchmen.  You have an evil machine that seems to have a life of its own.  You have the classic motive for action both good and ambiguous--money-and you have three--not one, but three--larger than life legendary heroes, who mentor and protect the naive, young hero, but do not diminish him by solving his problem for him.  Could there be a more classic script?  Probably not.
It's a western, America's favorite genre, wonderfully cast, beautifully staged, and lovingly filmed.  The wide open West, the mountains, the desert appear as if they were just made for the locale of the story.
For the first 10 or 20 minutes, you won't even be fully convinced that it is a fantasy.  It looks just like another Western, but as it takes off and the story develops, it becomes more and more improbably and more and more engaging.  The legendary heroes begin to grow larger than life; the villains get slimier and slimier.
I'm giving nothing away by telling you that it all comes out well in the end (all tall tales do), but not without some last minute heroics by the protagonists.
Best of all this is a movie kids can watch and enjoy as much as the adults.  The modest violence is child's play compared to more modern films, and the villains manage to exude evil without using a single four letter word.  No one takes off all their clothes.
If you are feeling beat up after a long week of work and want to see an uplifting, you-can-do-it-if-you-try movie, get ""Tall Tale"" while copies are still available.
This is a true classic.",1188518400,,1787,4.605678233438486

736720,4,6303929575,"I realized after watching this movie that this was the first live-action movie that I could remember having watched about some of America's larger-than-life legendary heroes.  When I was younger I read stories of Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan and John Henry, among others, but the only place I recall having seen these legends was in animated shorts.  Disney brought these characters together in a particular place and time to form a tale of growing up, eras passing, and morality.

The Hackett family lives in Paradise Valley.  Daniel Hackett (Nick Stahl, who has appeared in ""The Man without a Face,"" ""The Thin Red Line,"" ""Sin City,"" and numerous other films) is a stereotypical rebellious young boy frustrated by being stuck doing chores on the farm while the young industrial United States seems to be passing him by.  Jonas Hackett (Stephen Lang, credits include tv's ""Crime Story"" and ""The Amazing Panda Adventure"") is Daniel's father, with a firm belief in right and wrong and the rights of an individual.  Jonas loves his son but is frustrated by his son's lack of appreciation for his values.

J.P. Stiles is a railroad man who plans on putting his railroad through Paradise Valley so that the mineral wealth of the valley can be strip mined.  However, Jonas Hackett is a pivotal landowner who is at the center of the resistance to selling to J.P. Stiles.  J.P. Stiles has men and guns and pressures Jonas, to sell his land, and will use force if he must.  Unfortunately, Daniel witnesses his father being hurt by Stiles' men, just after his father gave him the deed to the farm for safe-keeping.

Daniel runs from Stiles' men, feeling guilty that he left his father, and yet needing to protect the deed.  Daniel runs to a boat on a lake in the valley, where the rope tying the boat to a dock slips.  Soon Daniel awakes in a desert, surrounded by outlaws.  Fortunately, Pecos Bill (Patrick Swayze) arrives in a tornado to shoot the trigger fingers off the outlaws before they can kill Daniel.  Daniel is unwilling to believe his eyes, and sees Pecos Bill as someone or something that belongs in the past.

Daniel and Pecos begin the journey back toward Daniel's home, but along the way the meet with Paul Bunyan (Oliver Platt, ""Working Girl,"" ""Benny & Joon,"" and numerous others) and John Henry (Roger Aaron Brown, ""Moon Over Parador"" and ""Robocop 2""), who join with them, though Paul frequently wonders why they are doing anything for Daniel, who seems to want to do nothing for anyone other than himself.  During one portion of their trip they encounter a scroungy-looking Calamity Jane (Catherine O'Hara), who only makes a brief appearance, and Burgess Meredith as an old man and William H. Macy as a railroad magnate.

Throughout the journey back to Daniel's home the three legends try to get Daniel to understand the code of the west, which is little more than doing the right thing.  I was continually annoyed with Daniel because he seemed to be taking along time to get the point, but just when I thought all was lost, he FINALLY understood.

Unfortunately, I can say little more without spoiling the fun, so I will stop here and say that I enjoyed the ending.

""Tall Tale"" is more than a simple morality story.  The West, and the United States, is changing.  We see a horseless carriage.  J.P. Stiles' train is a mechanical monster that exemplifies the lack of environmental concern of early industrialists.  Jonas Hackett represents the traditional values.  The United States was on the cusp of changes that would take us away from the wild days of the old west and vault us into a world power.  You sense that Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan and John Henry knew that their time was passing, and that other things were replacing them.  Yet, the values that they represented, hard work, belief in the individual, and taking care of the weak, represent values that needed to endure dramatic changes, which is the real lesson of this movie.

I have watched this movie twice.  The first time I was not impressed.  The second time I enjoyed the movie.  I am unable to tell you why the big difference, but I think the second time I focused on the legends more than on annoying Daniel, and I found the portrayal of the legends to be good.  There is a fair amount of violence in this PG movie, including trigger fingers being shot off (no blood, but you do get to see a finger), a jail break, and more than a little violence, so this movie is probably unsuitable for the younger members of the family and some older children.

In spite of the breakthroughs in technology, film makers have generally overlooked American legends.  Perhaps American legends are considered too irrelevant and uninteresting to make a popular movie.  It is also possible that children are no longer familiar with these legends that were still well-known when I was a child.  But perhaps a good movie like this can inspire a child to pick up a book and learn more.  I can only hope.",1131840000,8,4954,4.704176334106728
