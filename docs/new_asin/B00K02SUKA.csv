6397434,5,B00K02SUKA,"Once again I am so thankful for and excited by Pastor Lynns dance instruction videos. In Modern Dance II you learn more than just a few Modern Dance moves. The first time I worked through the DVD, I kept expecting the next teaching to be the last, but it kept going teaching after teaching! It is a treasure trove of dance moves and technique, as Pastor Lynn explains and demonstrates a movement, then follows it up with an exercise for you to practice. I found the class to be very challenging physically also, so it is a fantastic workout, while being a fun dance class all at the same time.",1431907200,,593,4.4
