8722652,4,B010MF9Z94,"I thought the movie was well done, but as is all too common, a transgender woman was played by a non transgender actress.  Due to that, there is a disingenuous feel at times.  I give this four stars, as it is still very capable of contributing to the conversation of transgender issues, but as a transgender woman, it does ring somewhat false.  Example, when the lead character is describing her first realization of being female, and having to hide the fact at a very young age...  this is common for many trans women, but the way in which it is portrayed lacks the depth of emotion that would be shown by a person who actually had to do so.",1526774400,,642,4.369747899159663
8722653,5,B010MF9Z94,"I enjoyed the whole movie, much better than prime time tv about crime and violence and the news. I don't understand the Finnish language of the movie but followed along with the captions, I thought the transgender woman was a man at first but is a woman actress, very great actress, all the actors and actresses were great! Good hearted movie!",1523923200,,343,4.639344262295082
8722654,5,B010MF9Z94,"Regardless of whether the movie is sympathetic or political towards the transgender issue, the picture itself is very well made. Great acting, interesting story, engaging characters, and suspenseful!  I felt that the time I invested into watching this film was worth it.",1520294400,,270,5.428571428571429
8722655,5,B010MF9Z94,"This is an enlightening movie whose characters are imperfect which makes them more relatable and human. The actresses and actors were tremendous in bringing such an array of complex issues and variety of relationships alive. Each character has issues, of loss, love, trust, making mistakes, risk taking, allowing oneself to be vulnerable, forgiveness, courage, honesty and sacrifice. A reflective movie that may make you cry at times. Worth watching at least once!",1519689600,,464,5.458333333333333
8722656,5,B010MF9Z94,"I was astonished to find myself loving this film. The actress who plays Mariit is wonderful, as are all the performers. The very last scene with Mariit and her daughter was so touching I found myself in tears. The movie is more about romantic love, familial love and love for a child and parent than it is about transgender living. I loved it.",1517443200,3,343,4.4603174603174605
8722657,1,B010MF9Z94,"TYPICAL OF A MOVIE ABOUT TRANSGENDER EXPERIENCES TOLD BY SOMEONE WHO IS NOT TRANSGENDER. THIS MOVIE WAS NOT AUTHENTIC AND I DON'T ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO WASTE THEIR TIME. WHY DO ALL TRANSGENDER MOVIE FOCUS ON TRANSGENDER PEOPLE'S LOVE LIFE? UNFORTUNATELY THE ""TRANSGENDER MOVIES"" [WRITTEN BY CISGENDER PEOPLE] I HAVE SEEN MAKES TRANSPEOPLE SEEM DESPERATE, WHICH IS FALSE.",1516924800,2,368,5.473684210526316
8722658,5,B010MF9Z94,"Such a complicated topic, yet the film is made so simply, revealing the complexities in nuanced expressions, gestures, scenes, and dialogues. Nothing seems to be out of line or overdone. I have a new insight, understanding and respect for transwomen's plight and desires.

But at the end of the day, aside from this film, I will always wonder, and in some ways believe that transwomen tend to find their core strength from the system of patriarchy (due to the fact they were born male), in which our world is helplessly and systemically entrenched, that sadly, transmen struggle to find.

I like how the film ends--a hopeful and renewed life.",1515369600,2,642,4.8807339449541285
