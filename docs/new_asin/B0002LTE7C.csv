It is intended as a companion to Bert van Lingen's excellent book ""Coaching Soccer,"" so if you don't have that book don't get this DVD.  This DVD illustrates four of the 4v4 variations from that book: 4 small goals, 2 large goals, line soccer, and long narrow field.  There are two or three others I would have liked to see.  The text is straight out of ""Coaching Soccer,"" so you don't have to get out pen and pad to write it down, which is good because there is no way to print the text straight from the DVD.  I like this DVD, it is at just the level one would expect, but it is not worth $30, and I really can't recommend it, not even for $10.  The 20 minutes of 4v4 video and a text file could have simply been put on a CD-ROM included with the book ""Coaching Soccer,"" much in the same way that Tino Stoop's 3 books come with a CD-ROM.",1204243200,3,1099,4.23444976076555
8028970,1,B0002LTE7C,"I had high hopes for this video.  When I watched it I was extremely disappointed.  Sometimes the title gives it away and this time it does.

This DVD included just four drills and all of them are, you guessed it, playing 4v4.  Playing 4v4 on a narrow field, on a small field, with no goal, with big goal.  It failed to even discuss the overall concept of dutch soccer.

They also gave coaching points for techniques such as how to pass a ball and shoot a ball.  Basically things taught to really young children.

I expected much more.  Instead of this video save your money and watch some free videos on Dutch soccer on youtube.  I got a lot more infomation there and it was free.",1181088000,3,680,4.325396825396825
