2833438,3,B000Q7ZLUQ,"I have read many of the books about ""All --"", and enjoyed them as well as the TV series in the past, but this one seemed a bit dated.",1419120000,,133,3.6206896551724137

2833441,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,Love this series based on the life of and best-selling book by country vet James Herriot.,1408579200,,89,4.625
2833442,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"It was an excellent dvd series set, great shape, and very fast shipping! Thanks!!!",1406160000,,82,4.928571428571429
2833443,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,I am sad that this was the last of this wonderful collection. Well worth the money and is something I can watch over again.,1404172800,,123,4.166666666666667
2833444,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"Wonderful and fun.
Great for all ages.
Will watch it again
Would tell others about it
Worth the price
Good for keeping",1388275200,,118,4.409090909090909
2833470,4,B000Q7ZLUQ,I was surprised that this last series was so good. Things have changed over the years with the characters but that is to be expected. My husband and I both enjoy watching this series.,1386892800,,183,4.411764705882353
2833471,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,This series #7 has now completed my collection. I love this series so much and watch it straight through about twice a year. The characters are so memorable.,1386720000,,157,4.642857142857143
2833472,4,B000Q7ZLUQ,"I have enjoyed each of the series, each because of the acting, the actors, the stories, and the beautiful English countryside.  My favorite to watch when it's pouring rain where I live.",1372464000,,185,4.78125
2833473,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,This whole series is so charming and entertaining.  The actors are very endearing and the animals are wonderful. I do not understand how they get the animals to act just as their parts require.  A sick dog or cow acts just as they would if they were sick in real life.  I will miss these people and animals when I have finished the series.  It is just the best.,1370044800,,361,4.188405797101449
2833474,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,Loved every minute of it.  British Comedy is so funny and serious at the same time.  Still watching some of them.,1368144000,,113,4.333333333333333
2833475,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"The entire ""All creatures great and small"" experience (season 1-7) is an extraordinary one, to be repeated again and again.",1363910400,,123,5.2
2833476,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"This is part of the series filmed in the late 1980s, with all of the charm of the original series intact. Many characters continue in the new series, which takes place immediately after WWII and through the early 50's, though the Helen Herriot part is played by a new actress. You'll come to love her, too! All of the animals and several of the irascible farmers from the first series make regular appearances in this new series, older but no less vexing to Sigfried, who still can't get them to pay for services rendered.
Mrs. Pomphrey and Wickie Woo, her pampered over-weight pekinese pooch, still rely on ""Uncle James"" to cure Wickie of maladies brought on by eating rich human food and not exercising. The animals still give birth, get sick, and die in ways that are portrayed very realistically or in fact, part of what made the series so engrossing for me in the first place.",1360886400,2,881,4.617834394904459
2833477,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"We are ex-patriot Brits and used to watch this series in Britain.  It was great to have the whole series. Delivery came on time, and with no damaged to the package.",1356480000,,164,4.290322580645161
2833478,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,I have fully enjoyed all the All Creatures Great and Small series and Series 7 is no exception. It always has some funny characters to laugh at or with and some beautiful scenery as well as some heartwarming interpersonal interactions.,1334534400,,235,4.9
2833479,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"Irresistably sweet, thank you BBC so much for this.  It leaves most of the current series playing on NPR in the dirt.  Very entertaining and a real eye-opener to see how a rural vet in post-war Yorkshire was so vital to the ranchers they serviced.  Sometimes difficult to understand the accents, though.",1280707200,,303,4.788461538461538
2833521,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,This is the last of the All Creatures Great and Small series and they were all wonderful to watch.,1234915200,,98,4.2105263157894735
2833522,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,Excellent entertainment and educational on the vet practice. Have watched several times and will watch several more!,1234396800,,116,5.882352941176471
2833523,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching the last series of this fantastic show. Was excited when I received series 6 & 7 in the post. Tried very hard to watch just one episode a day but that did not last for long! The stories again are great but the best part of the whole show was that it was good entertainment value with none or very few swear words used and apart from the ""punch - up(?)"" between the 2 brothers in one of the later episodes there was very little violence too! Have loved watching the whole series from 1 - 7 + the specials... now I will start at the very beginning again!",1233878400,2,580,4.1875
2833524,2,B000Q7ZLUQ,"All Creatures Great and Small Complete Series 7 is much less than the first six series of the BBC program.  It lacks the originality, humor and apparent spontenaity of the earlier programs.",1232323200,2,189,4.90625
2833525,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"I purchased Series 7 for my husband, for our 25th wedding anniversary. He has been a fan/collector for many years, and this was the last one left to obtain in our quest for the complete set. He says they are great-they are his one form of relaxation. He was also impressed that the 1990 Christmas special was included-we thought we wouldn't be able to get it at all. I don't think he has been disappointed with any of his All Creatures DVDs-they are all very watchable, and the era they are set in has been portrayed beautifully.
We would recommend it to all watchers of great British T.V.",1224374400,15,589,4.462962962962963
2833526,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"My family ""loves"" all of the All Creatures Great & Small produced by BBC.  This specific series is a continuation of the great stories played by wonderful actors of the daily life of a country vet in the Yorkshire Dales, England.  These stories are especially funny & enjoyable.  My question is?  Are there any more??",1219968000,,317,4.709090909090909
2833527,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,I have always loved James Herriot and the All Creatures Great and Small series. This dvd set arrived in accordance with the promised date and was in good condition and quality as represented by seller. The cost was good and I have no complaints,1216252800,,244,4.568181818181818
2833528,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"This series is really good and entertaining.  I have seen all the series prior to this one plus read all of James Herriott's books, at least twice.  Plus, I have farm animals.  The acting is great; the work with the animals is authentic.  I just wish there was a series 8, 9, 10......",1214092800,,284,4.30188679245283
2833529,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"A delightful conclusion to this touching series. When I first began watching Harriot's stories brought to life on the screen it was often difficult to understand because of the heavy accent of the local farmers and a number of the expressions exclusive to the Brits. However, over time, and often backing up the video to hear again what was being said, one's ear becomes accustomed to the dialogue used in the script. There is so much garbage and triviality on American television, i.e., language laced wih foul language and sex simply to titillate, that I found All Creatures to be most refreshing. The stories are 30 years old now, but this kind of entertainment never goes out of style. I treasure having this series in my film library so that I can return to these stories again and again.",1210723200,7,793,4.712230215827338
2833530,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,Absolutely love All Creatures Great and Small and Amazon's service.  Received Volume 7 on time and well packaged.  Thank you.,1210204800,,125,5.2
2833551,4,B000Q7ZLUQ,This was very well done. I was very satisfied with this product.  Love the whole story.  This was an excellant conclusion.,1207353600,,122,4.761904761904762
2833552,4,B000Q7ZLUQ,"For the die-hard James Herriot fans a must have, specially if you have the other 6 series already. It completes your collection and is as always
a pleasure to watch.",1202860800,,165,4.533333333333333
2833553,4,B000Q7ZLUQ,"The James Herriot series never seems to get tired - just like the wonderful books they are based on. This, the 7th season is every bit as fresh and witty as the others with most of the usual cast. The Herriot children re-appear in this series and as usual the writing for the kids and their acting just does not work. I'm not sure why kids always seem like cardboard cut-outs. As the kids play a rather minor role it's not a serious of a short-coming - it's a great season.",1198195200,,473,4.208791208791209
2833554,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"Great entertainment, well photographed and produced--all the participants are in character.  Of course, the animals are the best part!  This series is, in my opinion, better than the last one.",1194393600,3,192,5.366666666666666
2833555,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"I own every season of this series, and they're all worth the money.  Tristan finally comes home in this season, so prepare yourself for more wild antics.  He's still flirting with every girl he meets, and spending every spare moment at ""The Drovers"", but we wouldn't have him any other way, right?  James and Helen's kids have grown considerably, as you might expect.  Buy it, and enjoy it for yourself!!",1193443200,2,404,4.728571428571429
2833556,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"We have been enjoying ""All Creatures Great and Small"" by James Herriot and series 7 DVD set was the icing on the cake",1192060800,,117,4.130434782608695
2833557,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"Well this is the one we've all been waiting for. This wraps up the Series.
I really loved the "" Whole Series "" and couldn't hardly wait till this one came out. It seem like it was taking forever. Me personally, I like this type of movie but I know other this isn't their cup of tea. To us that do like it, it was Wonderful to see the life and times of this Country Vet.",1190505600,,369,3.8684210526315788
2833558,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,"Fans of ""Creatures"" will continue their enjoyment with this latest series.",1189123200,,74,5.818181818181818
2833559,5,B000Q7ZLUQ,This is the 7th and final season of All creatures great and small. It does include the 1990 xmas special too.,1186876800,2,109,4.238095238095238
2833560,4,B000Q7ZLUQ,It includes the seventh season and the 1990 Christmas special.,1178928000,9,62,5.3
8194917,2,B000Q7ZLUQ,"I bought this dvd to see if I would like the series in order to buy the complete set. Whomever directed-and wrote- for this series, based on this dvd- should be tossed into a muck pile. The characters are totally different from those in the books. I understand they are older in this ending dvd but it's enough to make you cry. Helen, that jolly woman from the novels, is a rather dumb but strict matron who snarls at James for doing the very things he has always done: missing important dinners due to his dedication to his job or coworkers, etc. In order to have Rosie-a tedious teenager- be well enough for a highschool event, Helen doses her with a random animal concotion, against Jame's advice, and so on. Poor James is very polite as he wanders around in his perfect suit and tie. I have read the novels since they appeared in the seventies and I know James' attire was old tattered smelly clothing and ratty boots. He was constantly  getting down and filthy. Siegfried was a bit tall, very thin, with a boney face and a manner and underlying secuality that had ladies fawning over him. This Siegfried is old, stout, and suffering from senile dementia rather than forgetfulness. I find him charming, ovetall, but in an elderly uncle sort of way. Tristan is a bore, with no charm or humor. And that's the difficulty at the heart of this dvd- and the series,I am betting. They took the most delightful moments and turned these into deadly serious scenarios thst often go on and on and on. The fellow who gets a needle in the butt doesn't get momentarily angry. He goes on a rant, along with his nasty wife. By the end of the episode she's having twins, but you feel very sad two nasty people are bringing a baby into their angry relationship. And on and on. Oh, and forget the wonderful house. This one is pristine and looks like it was built last year. Gone are Tristan's long hallways for biking. This house is so small the office is located in the surgery room! Or the desk is - and Helen works at the desk! Oh well, to quote Forest Gump: ""Stupid is as stupid does."" This is one stupid dvd/series and I couldn't finish it. Little humor, little likeness to the novels. Just a lot of tedious characters trying to get through the episodes.",1520294400,,2244,4.45985401459854
