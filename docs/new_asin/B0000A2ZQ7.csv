7995610,2,B0000A2ZQ7,"This disc consists of three short films in which living filmmakers try to respond to or recreate films of the Silent Era.  ""Queer"" in the title means ""non-normative,"" as not every one of the shorts has homoerotic content.  Because there are so many subtitles here, one can't watch this as passively as one would with a ""talkie.""  In fact, you can't blink because you'll miss something.  This work is meant to give a forum to young filmmakers.  Its intended audience is hardcore fans of independent film.  The last of the three works is the most touching, but also the most predictable and facile.  I am not sure who worships the Silent Era in this day and age, but the disc is for that small group.",1126051200,2,698,4.536
