7920758,4,B00004REL2,"It starts off almost normal, people talking around a campfire and theyt tell scary stories about the old Dread Mansion, a place that one of them has just bought. They all eventually get trapped inside in trypical HH fashion and things move along brisk at this point. By the middle, things really take some odd turns and the film kicks into overdrive. Gore flies, the camera zooms and twists and the story goes into some new and exciting places. To tell more would be to give too much away. Things heat up in this one and the pacing increases to a really great finish that had me on the edge of my seat. Great care seems to have been taken on the look of the film because I was really impressed with the atmosphere and the lighting. Sure, some of the acting is poor in spots, but othet acting is incredible (the guy in the wheelchair!) and the effects are very realistic and sick. I give it a 4 and a half. Impressive, entertaining and a lot of fun.",982281600,3,948,4.301675977653631
7920759,2,B00004REL2,"In The Shivers, some teenagers decide to have a party in the old Dread Mansion, a place with a history of violent deaths -- with a name like Dread what did you expect?  But, of course, forces of evil are unleashed and  gruesome mayhem ensues.  Director Todd Sheets' trademark violence and gore  are in full effect, but this one's lacking that spark that makes his other  films special. The Shivers is bogged down with tiresome clich&eacute;s (there are  plenty of closeups of banging doors and trembling hands on doorknobs) and  the characters never come to life.  But of course there are some grotesque  scenes here that recall the best of H.G. Lewis and Lucio Fulci (whom the  movie is dedicated to).
What The Shivers lacks in freshness through most  of its first half, it almost makes up for in ambition near the end. The  characters travel between dimensions unlocking ghastly secrets, facing off  against demons and evil spirits, and eventually come to a final  confrontation with Ebon Dread himself. But even ambition can't save this  one from its clich&eacute;d origins and long stretches of dull.
I'd recommend  Todd Sheets' extremely entertaining Violent New Breed over this one any  day.",961286400,2,1197,4.934673366834171
7920760,5,B00004REL2,"I have been a fan of all of director Todd Sheets later films.  His older films I don't really like, nor do I reccomend, however, since the original Zombie Bloodbath, I am always entertained and have a good time with each  title he creates.  Now he has surpassed my expectations with The  Shivers.
Not to be confused with the OTHER SHivers, an old David  Cronenberg film, this film is about a group of people throwing a party at  an old mansion they are working on.  The film really kicks into gear after  about 15 minutes of dialog to set things up.  Once the party goers get  locked inside the mansion, it's one gore scene after another and these  scenes are INTENSE!  Some of these are the grossest gore parts I have seen  since Lucio Fulci gouged eyes in ZOmbie!  I loved every minute of it!
But  there is more than gore here folks!  There is a story, some cool digital  effects, travels between dimensions and other worlds and even an incredible  bloopers collection under the credits.  All I can say is that if you want a  real Horror film, and you like low budget stuff, buy this.  It is way  better than the safe stuff Hollywood is cranking out and the guy genuinely  loves doing this and needs all our support!",955756800,,1218,4.411764705882353
