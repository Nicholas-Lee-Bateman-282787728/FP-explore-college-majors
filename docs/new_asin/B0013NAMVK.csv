8739008,4,B0013NAMVK,"There's a good chance that both silent movie and horror film fans will be familiar with the contents of ST. CLAIR's DVD triple-feature, SILENT CLASSICS. These well-regarded photoplays have long been in the public domain and enjoy wide circulation among purveyors of PD material.

None of the transfers are in any way restored and the music chosen is not specific to action on-screen. Such are the occasional limitations of budget-priced silent movies. One thing remains constant, however: these three are some of the finest pictures produced in the 1920s.

John Barrymore was in top form when he made DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. Many still consider this the definitive adaptation of the R.L. Stevenson novelette.

Director Fritz Lang's German Expressionist sci-fi masterpiece, METROPOLIS contains powerful images that remain with a viewer. This frightening look at a nightmarish future somehow never gets dated. Over 37,000 extras were used, and the budget adjusted to 21st Century dollars was about $200 million!

NOSFERATU is the vampire movie that Bram Stoker's widow fought legal battles over. The film was ordered by German courts to be destroyed, but a few copies survived in other countries. Only a single complete original is known to exist. It's owned by a private collector.

Another interesting ST. CLAIR silent movie set is their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MARY-PICKFORD-SIGNATURE-COLLECTION/dp/B0013NAMW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MARY PICKFORD SIGNATURE COLLECTION</a>.
