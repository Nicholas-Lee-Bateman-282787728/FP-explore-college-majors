3942228,2,B002KLQ2YA,"Have some of the series in Blu-ray, such as Brazil, but these are only about 43 mins. No where does it say they are edited. Save your money and buy the country separately. They have some extras, but still almost half the footage from the originals are missing.",1258156800,8,260,4.4375
3942229,1,B002KLQ2YA,I agree with others. This is NOT the complete collection. Certain episodes have been trimmed dramatically in length. The standalone episodes that were released were much more involving and had way more material! Buyers BEWARE!!! Shame on you Discovery Channel!! Shame!!,1257984000,60,269,5.585365853658536
3942230,2,B002KLQ2YA,"I'm a big fan of this series, and I own the previous Blu-ray releases of the first 4 episodes. While this is called ""The Complete Collection,"" it's far from it. The original discs I have are all around 100 mins, while the episodes on this set are all 43:35. More than half the original episodes are gone in these new trimmed versions (please note that some of these episodes were originally 2 hours, and some were 1 hour, so not all are drastically trimmed). I'm so disappointed in Discovery.",1257811200,95,492,4.53932584269663
3942231,2,B002KLQ2YA,"Update Dec 1 2009: As I said below on (Aug 12 2009), I only saw the Brazil and Italy episodes on a standard TV when they aired on the Discovery Channel. I was blown away. But after hearing how these and other episodes have been hacked away to less than half of their original running times, I'm dropping my rating of ""Discovery Atlas: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]"" from 5 stars to 2 stars. If you don't mind these summaries of the 4 episodes and want to see the summaries of other episodes that aren't unavailable individually on Blu-ray anwyay, then go ahead and get it. I'll probably get it because the price is right, and I'd like to see the other episodes, albeit shortened.

--------------

I've only seen the Brazil and Italy episodes in standard definition on a CRT TV when they aired on the Discovery Channel, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway. AMAZING! I love how they show a lot of the beauty of each country AND personalize it by following a few people from each country so we can kind of see it from their perspectives. So as such, it's not intended to be a history or geography lesson, but rather a flavor of life in those countries with the beautiful cinematography we've come to expect from Discovery.

Anyway, since the Discovery Atlas series is currently only available on Blu-ray as independent episodes/countries, I recommend you view the descriptions and reviews of the individual episodes/countries for the series.

I can't wait to see the entire series on Blu-ray!

Since Amazon is missing much of the description (like which countries are included in this set) and the ""update product info"" link doesn't allow people to include a true DESCRIPTION, I'm including it in review format.

From the series' website (please note that Japan is missing from the description, so is it included in this set or not?):

India - India is one of the world's rising superpowers. A vast population and landmass, a weight of history and culture that stretches back for millennia. Meet the people that make this great nation.

China - Coupling insightful storytelling with spectacular and ground-breaking photographic techniques, ''Atlas: China Revealed'' brings alive the fascinating and complex contemporary life of one of the greatest nations on earth.

Brazil - Brazil is a beautiful country surrounded with beaches, jungles, and landscaping mountains. ''Atlas: Brazil Revealed'' plunges into this vibrant country and discovers that the native people are just as interesting and colorful as the land itself.

France - France is a country where life itself is an art form. Food, drink, history and tradition are taken seriously. An explosives expert, a radical chef and a man who scales skyscrapers are among the people who share their country and what it means to be French.

Australia - Its the only country that is a continent. Its one of the driest places on the planet and spans over 4 million miles with over 22,000 miles of coastline. Australia has become home to over 20 million people surviving in a vast and absolutely amazing land.

Italy - Throughout one Italian year, the program tells the stories of unique characters and displays Italian life within the natural cycle of the seasons. While taking this journey, watch the individual storylines unravel the lives of ordinary Italians.

Mexico - From the famous single cry, 'Viva Mexico!' that sweeps the country every Independence Day, to the spectacle and pageantry summoned by reverence for the Virgin of Guadalupe, ''Atlas: Mexico Revealed'' is a journey into the heart of this amazing country.",1250035200,6,3574,4.954849498327759

8372090,2,B002KLQ2YA,"This DVD attempted to cover certain areas of the World. (South Africa, Japan, Italy etc etc.) While I will be the first to admit that the Photography was excellent. Which was first rate overall.  On the whole however it was rather boring and predictable. Because of its PC and predictable story telling.

Here is the plot line as I saw it. Some one usually a woman elected to over come an obstacle and eventual victory. It does not however go on to actually explain what is going on in the area. For example the decline of South Africa due to its political corruption, violence and mismanagement.
Or for another example, how did the City of Venice come about & some of the problems it is facing and fighting with. (Flooding, decline of the general population or the issue of tourism)

It would of also been nice. If the story about how things have come about in this area or why do Folks in the area described behave the way they do. Clearly the film did not have the guts to look deeper in the subject. Instead it just produced a fluff film.

Sadly this had the potential to be a first rate travel, Geography , history film that would of been a first rate tool in the classroom. But it fell sadly below the mark. I strongly suggest that instead one should use Michael Palins excellent travel journals instead.",1497916800,,1310,4.468619246861925

8372092,5,B002KLQ2YA,"I used this while teaching 9th grade geography/literacy. Videos are engaging, positive (avoiding stereotypes), and informative. Definitely better than some of the boring or awkward educational videos out there. Absolutely appropriate for middle or high school. Each episode is about 30 minutes, which is a good length to break up a block period or an easy lesson  to leave with a sub. (If you google, you will find teacher created worksheets pre made for each episode.) Each episode is structured roughly the same, and I've used these to teach compare/contrast to English Language Learners. I've also used episodes in a Language Arts class when teaching short stories that take place in other countries.

Note to teachers of immature children-- there is a scene in the South Africa episode in which women are wearing traditional clothing and you see breasts of various shapes and sizes. Not a big deal at all, but my kiddos had trouble keeping from giggling.",1464825600,,958,5.056962025316456
