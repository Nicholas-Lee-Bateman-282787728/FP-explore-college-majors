8104447,5,B000E1XPA2,Excellent.  I thought this was his best material ever.  I loved his biblical and literary allusions to make his point.  The backdrop to his presentation was well done artistically.,1494633600,,180,5.137931034482759
8104448,5,B000E1XPA2,"This is a phenomenal DVD that portrays God's love story to us. It gave me perspective on the struggles of this life and caused me to remember that there is a bigger picture than the circumstances that are playing out in my life. Watching and hearing the message rekindled hope and anticipation of a kingdom restored and reminded me that ""happily ever after"" is not a fairy tale. My first viewing of the DVD came at a time when my soul was quite weary. Eldridge's dramatization and delivery of this message aligned with truth and engaged my intellect as well as my emotion. Though I am not one for purchasing DVDs for keeps, this is a DVD I knew I would want to see again and again!",1475798400,,681,4.3700787401574805

8104450,5,B000E1XPA2,"A must for those who love ""stories"", John Elderidge is a master storyteller. His perception of how all stories mirror the greatest story ever told, realistically and simplistically weaves the truth while entertaining through stories we love.",1246665600,,241,5.54054054054054
8104451,5,B000E1XPA2,"I've been a Christian for 30 of my 36 years and this DVD impacted me more than any sermon I've heard.  Eldredge offers three versions--a short 37 minute version, an hour long version, and a small group study version that is just over 1 1/2 hours with commentaries if you watch all 6 parts at once.  I highly HIGHLY recommend that the first time you watch it, you go ahead and commit to watching the study version all the way through in one sitting. I got several life-changing insights and they keep coming.

The Prologue sets up the format.  Eldredge presents in a very watchable format.  He's quite good and the set, music, lights all add to the DVD's ability to draw you right into the story he is telling.  That's the gist.  He presents the gospel as an epic--a story and gives us a larger view of Christianity and where we fit into it.  It's SOOO not all about us, yet we are a valuable part of it, we have our role to play.

The first ""Act"" is Eternal Love.  It made me see God's nature more clearly.  Yes, God is love, as we have all heard.  But understanding the Trinity love relationship helped lay a foundation for the overall insight of We can trust the heart of God.  That we are invited into something good that already exists and offers a sense of belonging to something greater.

The second act ""Entrance of Evil""  reminded me that sometimes I forget and see the world (and thus God)as if there weren't a villian.  I also see how his biggest lie (You can't trust the heart of God) was being perpetuated long before creation.  It was effective with the fallen angels and I fall prey to it sometimes myself.

The third act is where creation began and we currently are.  I've heard (even occasionally taught) that God loves me innumerable times.  While I knew in my head that this was unmistakeably true, I never experienced it like I did because of this.  ""The Passion of Christ"" gave me a glimmer, but this  much, much more so.  The way Eldridge describes creation and us made in the Trinity's likeness (an echo) made me feel Psalms 139:13 like never before.  I've struggled with feeling valuable and this insight offered a sense of security I've had a difficult time obtaining.  Despite what we do (the she-camel verse struck my very heart), God still melts for us and pursues us, without force.  Christ's life and death somehow seem more real to me.  With love like this, I can trust the heart of God.

Act four talks about Heaven.  NOT the typical (unfortunately) view of heaven and endless (i.e. boring) worship and praisefests.  (Yes, we will worship God, but not just through song and church services in the sky)  This presents a biblical view of heaven that really does sound like heaven.  You really need to hear this, it's inspiring and exhilirating.

The Epilogue wraps it up and reasserts our place in the epic.

There isn't anyway to convey all the ways or the degree how this DVD moved me and changed me.  It's still happening.  I find myself coming back to it again and again.  I know Eldredge has written for men, I'm a woman and I don't think this is targeted just for men at all. I think it will speak most strongly to those who enjoy reading and movies a little more, just because he references so many.  Each reference, if you're familiar with it, can evoke a feeling or situation in an instant that only adds to the message he is conveying.  However, you don't have to know all the references to get an amazing amount out of it.",1171929600,,3462,4.460925039872408
8104452,5,B000E1XPA2,"If you have ever wanted to investigate what Christianity is really all about this is the piece for you.  John Eldredge uses a screenwriting format to take you thru the story of the Christian faith, and he uses language that is so familiar to any movie lover...no big theological words or complex theological systems...just the story of God and His creation told in such a way to inspire any believer to reexamine his own part of the story and any non believer to rethink his preconceived notions as to what this ""religion"" is all about.  You will not be disappointed.  You will be swept away with the presentation and wish all your friends could have watched it with you.",1142553600,3,671,4.621848739495798
8104453,5,B000E1XPA2,"John's acting ability shines through in this one hour monolog in which he reviews the history of the universe from a Judeo-Christian vantage point. He then beautifully outines the the history, purpose and meaning of our lives in this cosmic epic. His treatment of the future of those who answer the battle call is superb.
A must see for those who believe and a superbly done challenge to those who are unsure, confused or just curious.",1140739200,2,435,4.7368421052631575
