2245036,5,B0007UVXEA,"I saw all the negative comments regarding the voice of Bob changing, and I can definitely see how it will make a child scratch their head if they are use to Bob acting and speaking differently.  In the ""new"" Bob's defense, it does say it is a brand new series so you can't expect it to be exactly the same.  I am sure a lot of the kids who use to watch this have gotten older and moved on to other cartoons and characters so they won't care, and the old fans still have all the other videos and DVD's to see.

I like what I am seeing in this show, and my son is crazy about Bob building a new town from the ground up.  He now has to have every toy associated with the show and is a newly devoted fan. The new actor who plays Bob is none other than the awesome Greg Proops from Whose Line is it Anyway fame!!! He is a riot in person and I couldn't think of a better voice to start the new Bob series off with.  Neither my son nor I had ever seen the old Bob or heard the old Bob, so I guess we are starting at the perfect time, as it seems Greg Proops is here to stay in the new series.  I can tell you my son loves this DVD, both the intro episode to the new Build It show, and the two new episodes of the series.  You get a lot for the money on this DVD.

While fans of the old show can cringe at the ""new"" Bob, he's just won over some new viewers and I am sure he will continue to do so, especially since he is now voiced by such a talented actor.  One thing I question is where does Spud the potato guy fit into all this?  He is a very odd character and his British accent (which I hear is new) seems to fit his quirky self.  I just am not sure who thought up a potato person to be a friend of a construction worker??

I noticed this new DVD lists Greg Proops as the voice of Bob on the back cover, and all the others did not, so hopefully it will continue to do this on future DVD releases, this way the fans of the new show can stick with it, and fans of the older series can still decipher which ones they want.",1125360000,7,2017,3.8105515587529974
2245037,1,B0007UVXEA,"First off, the voices of Bob and most/all the rest are different. Spud is British-- Farmer Pickles imports scarecrows?
Bob is an anti-development, tie-dye wearing environmentalist.  Instead of showing the positive and negatives of large developments in Sunflower Valley, developers are shown as bad guys. Bob has a nightmare, complete with menacing music, as big buildings grow from the ground everywhere, obliterating the idyllic valley.
I love nature, and am for careful planning, but this is way over the top. And while reclycling is good, chanting ""Reduce Recycle Reuse"" cultishly is a bit too much for me. Overall this is really pretty heavy-handed politics for a kids show, and the producers should be ashamed.",1125187200,7,716,5.280701754385965
2245038,2,B0007UVXEA,"My son is 2 1/2 years old and he loves Bob, so when I put the dvd on he was really happy to watch. But after a little while  I noticed he was not paying attencion as he usually does and then I noticed Bob's voice was not the same at all and also Scoop's voice. The story is really cute and I also like the new character Scrambler. Maybe he will get use to the new voice, but to me is just no the same Bob we are use to.",1125014400,6,419,3.6043956043956045

8052049,2,B0007UVXEA,"I did not like this version as the caracters had american accents. No offence to the american accent or Americans but after a year or more in an english accent it is hard to enjoy it being changed. Even my 2 and 3 year old do not like it. They just walk off and ask for Bob the builder even when this one is showing.
Perhaps the discs need to mention that it has an american accents for the characters.",1305072000,,402,4.0375
8052050,4,B0007UVXEA,"this was as described, not bad in price ( but s&h is always too high) and my son seemed to like it alright. didn't like that the case was clear, not art work, not orig case, but dvd did play ok.",1237939200,,194,3.7560975609756095

8052052,5,B0007UVXEA,"Not being a regular watcher/fan of Bob the Builder movies, I was not aware of the changed character voices. I first viewed the movie with my five-year-old nephew who is a Bob fan, and he did not notice the differences. We both enjoyed the movie and the lesson. It is a great first learning tool for children to understand about the environment and how they too are able to contribute to the preservation. I have since shown the movie to a group of 3-7 year olds in the community to teach about recycling. The showing was well attended and received. Each child walked away reciting the movie's mantra ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle."" I recommend the whole family watching this film together. The teenagers might role their eyes at some of the antics, but they too will find themselves remembering the 3 Rs. I apologize in advance for you not being able to sleep due to Lofty, Scoop, and the Gang's chants of ""Yes, We Can!""",1170201600,,914,4.579268292682927
8052053,5,B0007UVXEA,"At first the new voice was ""weird"" but my almost 4 year old son did not skip a beat! He LOVES the new characters Benny and Scrambler. He never mentioned the new voices. I have read some of the other reviews and say so what if Bob now sends the message to Renue, Reuse and Recycle...my son thinks it is cool. Is there anything wrong with teaching a little conservation? I also like that Lofty now says I think so in a more up beat way....overall I think the characters are more up beat and Bob does not make fun of his father anymore...he actually shows more respect for the way or the reason his father is doing things unlike in previouse shows where he got VERY impatient with his Dad. My son loves to watch the progress of Bob building in Sunflower Valley and loves Farmer Pickles new straw house.

If your child is a Bob the builder fan he will LOVE this new DVD and the new show over all.",1129075200,2,892,4.186046511627907
8052054,3,B0007UVXEA,"Alright, perhaps I am an overly protective mother, but when I heard there would be a new Bob movie I became both excited and cautious.

Bob the Builder was originally a British construct, from my information.  My cousin in London sent me a CD of some great modern pop songs addapted to the theme.  My fav?  Mambo number 5...

Having seen only the first episode of the new series (and not as yet the movie) I squinted at the screen (having forgotten my glasses in the shower) in utter frustration trying to place 'that' voice.  My four year old son had fallen back to sleep, only to stir at my yell across the house to my husband, ""Hey, it's that guy from Who's line"".

To either my utter joy or shame, Whose Line is it Anyway happens to be one of my son's favorite shows.  Next time you're stuck in line at the post office try playing 'Props' with the express envelopes.  My son has yet to notice, still sleeping as he is, but he is sure to and it'll either be the coolest thing ever or a 'Mommie, why does Bob sound more like Wendy"" moment.  Either way, we'll weather the storm...much like when Joe started house sitting Blue when Steve went off to College.  But at least that transition episode we didn't have to pay for.  And does anybody know what happend to Steve Burns anyway?",1128816000,,1282,4.340336134453781
8052055,2,B0007UVXEA,"We just could not get over the drastic changes in the voices. Bob, Spud, Lofty, & Mr. Bentley all had different voices than the original series and movies. Bob & Spud were especially difficult to listen to. This movie did not hold my children's attention the way the other Bob the Builder movies have. I'm sure it's because of the voices. The environmental message was a bit overdone, but we could even tolerate that if the voices weren't so different! I would NOT rebuy this movie knowing what I know now. We should have borrowed it from the library instead.",1127001600,4,559,4.6
8052056,5,B0007UVXEA,"I and my family love Bob we realise that as he gets older he changes just like the children who watch him.  The change in character voice was noticed but nobody cared, we still loved it.  However, the subject matter - AWSOME.  Finally, an enjoyable project of some real building (rather than filling a hole in the road or putting a new roof on a barn), this time it's a new town.

This grand scheme of things is made truly essential viewing, by it's environmental soundness.  It seems to me that since we adults are a lost cause (the phrase, ""I'll be dead before anything happens so why should I worry,"" springs to mind).  This project sets a standard of living we should all be aspiring to.  It's a sound, funny, educational and dare I say it ""thought provoking"" chapter for Bob.  He's always been a fine bloke but now he's really proved he cares about the future and using his what he does best (Building!!) to do a great job.

A word of warning, if your household lives like there is no tomorrow (i.e. wasting energy and materials) obviously for a number good reasons......  Allowing your kids to watch this could result in some very embarrassing questions.  We're in the process of getting a solar panel and went for a picnic to a wind farm.",1126656000,3,1245,4.464601769911504
8052057,1,B0007UVXEA,"Bob the Builder used to be this innocent kids show where our Bob Villa-esque hero fixed roofs and built barns for his neighbors, but in this new series Bob looks like he's been hanging out with Captain Planet a little too much.  The familiar ""Yes we can!"" motto takes a back seat to Bob's new warcry of ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,"" which is repeated no less than 50 times in the first episode.  The first episode, which includes a scene of a barefoot, tie-dye wearing Bob, centers around Bob killing a tax revenue-producing vacation development in favor of community (because ""city"" is a dirty word) built on reverence to the environment.

Bob and his crew of presumably low-emission construction machines are charged with building the community, and are joined by new character apparently inspired by Homer Simpsons' ill-fated ""Poochy"" personality (Hey kids... Recycle to the extreme!!)  And most of the familiar characters are voiced by different people: Bob, Lofty, Spud, and Mr. Bentley have all new voices.

All I can say is the pre-school set is a little young to be pushing a political agenda, and all this is a little much for someone older than the target audience to take. The one star is mostly for technical advances over previous Bob releases, and for keeping the kickin' Bob theme song.

Of course, my 3 year old loved it, and we'll probably get the next Project: Build It video when it's released in November.",1126051200,13,1421,4.827160493827161
