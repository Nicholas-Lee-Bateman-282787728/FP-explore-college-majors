4592917,4,B0056YMDSC,My kiddos love this movie short. I enjoy watching it with them. I always like Shreks witty and cynical humor. The kids just sit and giggle.,1319587200,,139,4.384615384615385
4592918,1,B0056YMDSC,I guess I am the only one that hated the Shrek portion of this double pack.  I don't feel like it is appropriate for children and I found it to be any thing but funny. Doing the take on Psycho where Pinnochio's head spins and he throws up on Shrek is the point where I turned it off.  My husband watched it all the way through and agreed that it is not appropriate for children.  I was very dissappointed.  The Monsters vs Pumpkins looks to be a cute story however I have only seen the first 7 minutes so I will be back with my review on it.,1319155200,4,541,3.9814814814814814
4592919,5,B0056YMDSC,"The movies are very cute. If you are a fan of Sherek or Monster vs Aliens then you are sure to like these as well. I wish there were a little longer, but over all very good.",1318636800,,173,3.7027027027027026
4592920,5,B0056YMDSC,"I DVR both of these programs when they came out and haved them locked in.  I have been surprised that it has taken so long to get Monsters vs. Aliens on DVD as it was shown 2 years ago.  Shrek was released last year so not as long of a wait, although disappointing that Eddie Murphy did not play the part of Donkey the voice is very close.  My kids loved the shows and are very enjoyable to watch as adults.  I'll be glad to be able to remove these from my DVR.",1316476800,6,461,3.924731182795699
4592974,5,B0056YMDSC,My kids just loved these movies and my only regret was that they were so short.  They were just as entertaining as the originals and the Shrek version of Thriller was just AWESOME!!!,1344902400,,182,4.515151515151516

4592979,4,B0056YMDSC,"When I saw these, I thought it was must have for the kids, to get them into halloween spirit. Well it's not halloween anymore and they still watch em.

4592980,4,B0056YMDSC,"Dreamworks released this collection of movie shorts based on some of their most popular animated movies; Shrek and Monsters vs. Aliens.  Two of the shorts come from the Shrek franchise, and take place after the last movie as they feature Shrek, Fiona and three little ogres, along with most of the key characters from movies.  The last short takes place after the Monsters vs. Aliens movie.  All three are quite funny and ridiculous.  Luckily, the characters in all three shorts are voiced by their original stars like Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon, etc..  Clocking in at about an hour in length, these shorts are complimented by a bevy of extra features.  Too bad Dreamworks did not include the shorts from How to Train Your Dragon on this same combo pack.",1322006400,,771,4.847328244274809

4592982,5,B0056YMDSC,"Dreamworks generally doesn't make bad cartoons as far as I can tell.  The first Shrek cartoon not to have Eddy Murphy play Donkey, the guy they got to replace him sounded exactly like him.  The Monsters Vs. Aliens short picked up right where the movie left off.

Both cartoons were the high quality fair I've come to expect from Dreamworks and well worth buying.",1320624000,,362,4.625
