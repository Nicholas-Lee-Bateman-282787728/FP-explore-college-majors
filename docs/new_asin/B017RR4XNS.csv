7513053,5,B017RR4XNS,"I bought this movie for the dog as I used to show Belgians, but was pleasantly surprised that it was a fun, fairly well done kid-friendly show.  Good job keeping the story moving and the child actors were good.  Fairly predictible, but still a good adventure that kids and adults will enjoy.  Good values represented, except for kids who just can't stay out of trouble!",1462579200,,369,4.6461538461538465

8740158,5,B017RR4XNS,"Thoroughly enjoyed this fun K-9 adventure.  You might also want to get the first movie Scoot and Kassie's Christmas Adventure.  They are both really clean, fun movies for kids and adults. I hope they continue making these with the same group of kids and main characters, but a little sooner than every 3 years, the kids will grow up too fast.  Make another one sooooon! Highly recommend.",1486944000,,387,4.746268656716418
