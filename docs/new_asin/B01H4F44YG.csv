8764713,4,B01H4F44YG,"Top Cat is one of my favorite classic cartoons and I think the essence of the movie is close to the cartoon. This isn't the perfect adaptation, but the story is enough to make you remember the cartoon fondly. I missed Choo Choo, Fancy, & Spook's original accents, but Top Cat & Benny were spot on. The somewhat darker/edgier scenes in the movie were still tame enough for a younger audience. I also liked the inclusion of Benny's mom. Overall, this is a fun movie.",1534118400,,464,4.470588235294118
8764714,1,B01H4F44YG,"If they put their budget in the animation and writing instead of the soundtrack, maybe this would be better. Character designs could have been better executed from transitioning from 2D to 3D, which has been evident in other 2D to 3D film/television adaptations. Plus the animation was painfully choppy, which choppiness can work in animation, but it doesn't work here. The special effects and textures could've had more to them to add some extra dimension as well.
As for writing, boy, did my girlfriend and I not know what was going on. The plot was heavily inconsistent. Who are all these characters? What are their purposes? Some of the characters could have been chucked out of the movie, and it would've made it less confusing. Plus, the motives are not entirely clear, and there are plot holes littering this movie.
More of a nitpick, while the voice actors were trying to match the voices performed by the original actors, most of them did not succeed either by imitating the voice or bringing something interesting or new to the table.
Last addition, my girlfriend was really freaked out by the Meghan Trainor Cat.",1530576000,3,1123,4.854166666666667
8764715,4,B01H4F44YG,"Top Cat Begins is a movie that is geared more towards the new generation. The movie takes place in New York and it tells the story of how this infamous gang came together. The mood of the movie is light and entertaining. The soundtrack is pretty good and there are not any gory violent scenes. I enjoyed the movie and if you are familiar with the back-in-the day cartoon, you may find yourself laughing along. Just keep an open mind that the movie does differ from the cartoon (in some aspects). My five year old nephew and I found it appealing. On the other hand, my partner fell asleep during the ending scenes. I appreciate you for taking time out to read my review. I hope it is informative.",1524873600,6,695,4.395348837209302

8764718,5,B01H4F44YG,"I bought this DVD for my grandsons and me and we all throughly enjoyed it. Although it doesn't have the flavor nor nostalgia of the original TV series I remember as a child, it still entertains.

This is a good guy versus bad guy plot with Top Cat and the gang eventually helping the less forunate. Whoever does the voices for the characters gets close to the original voices although no one can replace the late Arnold Stang.",1510704000,,426,4.461538461538462

8764720,3,B01H4F44YG,"This Top Cat film is not related to any other production. The film opens with the gang attempting to pull a scam on crime boss Mr. Big. They get caught and have an hour long flashback, starting when Top Cat comes to the city and first meets Benny. TC is scamming people in Mr. Big's territory which doesn't go over too well.

It appears Top Cat is very popular in Latin America as this is a Mexican production. The characters are based on ""The Phil Silver's Show"" and not the Bowery Boys as many contend. Personally I thought Benny was modeled after Lou Costello. The 3D graphics were decent, although the story line didn't grab me and the humor didn't fly. It might have some appeal to your five year old vigilante.",1466035200,2,716,4.424242424242424
