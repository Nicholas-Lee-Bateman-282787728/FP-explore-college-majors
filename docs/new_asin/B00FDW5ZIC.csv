The reason that I rated this a ""4 Star"" is because of the experience I had working with the director, Noriko Kambara. Noriko is from Japan, moved to the US and decided to make this film on a small budget. She did an outstanding job of working with not only me but everyone connected to the film. This was filmed summer/fall of 2011. Believe Again, is a film story that was made to encourage & inspire people.",1414368000,,526,4.166666666666667
8614559,1,B00FDW5ZIC,"If you looked in the dictionary for the word ""corny"" you'd find this movie. Awful, awful acting, terrible background music, even the cinematography was terrible. Everything looked fake like they did this on a $50.00 budget. What a waste of money! But don't listen to me watch it and see for yourselves!",1412553600,,302,4.826923076923077
