This drama is part ghost story, part time travel, part hilarious rom-com, part statement on human rights for freedom and so much more. I don't usually like my genres all mixed up but this writer makes it work and casting Yoo Ah in certainly didn't hurt any. In fact, as the drama deals with the past of occupied Korea under Japanese rule, all of the actors' performances are amazing. That's not too set their performances aren't good during the present-day timeline, it's just that the past is a fight for a nation's survival and there's a certain amount of gravitas that comes with that.

Unlike how most Kdramas have final episodes that make you sigh and tell yourself, ""You know they're all like this so just be glad for the enjoyment it gave you before they totally flubbed up the last episode"".  Chicago Typewriter is a COMPLETE and SATISFYING journey.",1521849600,,1092,4.797872340425532
