2521519,3,B000EHQ7Z6,"The Nun (or La Monja) seemed to have all kinds of potential.  I mean, who doesn't want to see a movie about a nun who returns from the grave to kill the girls she hated so much when she was their teacher?  Here, the Nun can only manifest in water, which even gives the film an odd little angle to call its own.  Throw in some pretty good special effects and an effectively creepy atmosphere, and you start asking yourself why this film was denied a theatrical release.  Then you watch the film, and the reason eventually becomes clear - The Nun is cursed with a relatively poor script and a really lame ending.  I found this particularly disappointing because I had truly admired the scripts of Jaume Balaguero in Darkness and The Nameless.

The story really starts eighteen years in the past, where we watch Sister Ursula give her class of female students a tough lesson on the wages of sin.  She's particularly unhappy with Mary, Cristy, Susana, Zoe, and Eulalia because they just aren't living up to the standards of the saints they supposedly share their names with.  Back in the present, we are treated to a well-paced, atmospheric scene culminating in the death of Mary - the special effects of the water-borne Nun are really quite impressive here.  Having witnessed the culmination of her mother's death, young Eva (Anita Briem) soon finds herself in the middle of an unbelievable mystery.  In short order, after an old classmate of her mother's is similarly murdered, and she finds evidence that her mother was planning a trip back to Spain to visit her other boarding school friends, Eva insists on taking the trip herself and finding out why and how her mother truly died.  Accompanied by her best friend Julia (Beven Blanco) and Julia's annoying boyfriend Joel (Alistair Freeland) - and picking up a seminary student named Gabriel (Manu Fullola) along the way - the group eventually find themselves at the long-abandoned site of the old boarding school.  It is here, in the company of the two former school girls yet to die, that the script begins deviating south every so often.

While the CGI effects aren't always perfectly believable, the Nun's every appearance makes for a highlight of the film.  She's pretty evil-looking when she wants to be, and she knows what she's doing when it comes to killing former Catholic school girls.  The bodies don't always end up in one piece, and most of the death shots are framed quite well.  Unfortunately, rather than just sit back and enjoy the ghost nun's handiwork, we're compelled to learn what really happened at the boarding school eighteen years ago as the characters slowly begin putting all of the pieces together.  Prepare yourselves for several remarkable leaps of logic and an ending that is simply not tenable based on everything that has come before.  You may also want to prepare yourself to hit rewind every so often - this is basically a Spanish production, and even though the characters all speak English, I sometimes struggled to understand the dialogue of several actresses' strong Spanish accents.

With its impressive cinematography, suitably dark atmosphere, and handful of satisfying deaths, I think The Nun is certainly worth watching.  I was actually prepared to give the film four stars - despite its sizable plot holes - until the ending rolled around.  It's never pretty when a decent film commits cinematic suicide - especially when it is we, the audience, who are forced to swallow the bitter pill of a poisonous conclusion.",1153526400,10,3510,4.855704697986577
2521520,1,B000EHQ7Z6,"I had a hard time deciding whether i should rate this film with one or five stars.  the bottom line is that this is not a bad film, it's an absolute disaster of a film. BUT, this is so bad it's good.  I saw this at the movies last night hoping for a little scare, and instead I had a good hearty laugh from beginning to end.

if you are older than 13 years old, and if you have more than 5 working brain cells, THE NUN will be as scary, believable or logical as an episode of ""Scooby Doo"".

The idea is not bad:  Spirit of dead nun seeks revenge on  former boarding school girls, giving them the brutal deaths women saints suffered.

The production values are strong:  the sets look fantastic, music and mood are great.  Most of the acting is even passable. However, this movie has more holes than a slice of swiss cheese:  This is a Spanish production in spoken English, and the language-culture inconsistencies are very distracting.  Some of the special effects are cool, but most of them are annoyingly amateurish, and the scares are all just like someone screaming ""boo""  as they jump from behind the door.

The script is its worst flaw.  Besides the predictable plot, this movie has some of the silliest, campiest dialogue ever written and the situations ae shockingly laughable.  Example:

ZOE:  ""I have no intention of dying burned in an oven!!!""

(moments later)

ZOE:  ""I am going to the kitchen""

Yes, this was a terrible movie.  But we had so much fun watching it I feel this movie deserves a life as a midnight movie, or slumber party entertainment.",1151539200,16,1561,4.5
2521521,5,B000EHQ7Z6,"Nun is chilling film, with deliciously devilish special effects, a fast script, and well executed acting. In it, Eve, an innocent eighteen year old that just graduated high school comes home from a party to find her mother's throat cut, and she sees a nun at the scene of the crime. Of course no one believes her, until the funeral, when she meets a mysterious woman that knew her mother years ago. So begins a frightening tale of judgment, murder, and revenge.

The special effects were well done and engaging. Since the nun can only appear in water, and only appears to certain people, some of the images are quite interesting. The plot moves extremely fast. So many people are murdered it feels brutal, and leaves you wondering just who will be left at the end of the movie. The ending is surprising and leaves you with that `nice twist' feeling.

Over all, Nun is a slick horror movie that's far better than many that have made it to the big screen in the past few years (Fog, Cursed, and Darkness, for instance). So if you're looking for a fun and stylish horror movie, then check out Nun. You won't be disappointed.

2521522,2,B000EHQ7Z6,"The trailer for this movie is probably better than the whole film.  Stuffed with oodles of atmosphere and some unique and spooky effects, the movie fails due to its frenzied plot, mediocre acting and a soundtrack that often overshadows the dialogue.  Some of the accents also make it difficult to understand.  The movie's twist ending is also rather forced, and it negates the basic plot of the film.  Lions Gate needs to be more selective in the films it finances.",1151107200,,465,4.775
2521523,3,B000EHQ7Z6,"It's a low-budget spooker, but ""The Nun"" was actually better than I thought it would be.  The actors were very good, the story moved along nicely, and there were some interesting plot points that added to the overall story.  The killing scenes were brief, and the nun herself -- in all her hideous watery glory -- was actually done well.  The ending was a little disappointing because it seemed rather ""rushed"", but otherwise I enjoyed this film.  You don't to buy this one, but it's a good escapist view for an hour  or so.  It's certainly better than a lot of so-called horror films out there.",1150588800,4,595,4.566037735849057
2521524,2,B000EHQ7Z6,"Here's another low-budget horror, this time a Spanish produced film that has a very attractive box cover that is sure to entice a lot of people to rent it.  Unfortunately the box may be the best thing about the film.  The plot concerns a boarding school for girls an a tyrannical nun.  After years of abuse the girls turn on the nun and she is never seen again.  20 years later, of course, the girls start getting killed, blah, blah, blah.  Certainly nothing original to speak of plot wise.  In fairness, there is some genuine suspense although it doesn't actually result in many scares however.  The film looks pretty decent from a technical standpoint.  It's filmed well and looks pretty creepy.  Can't say the same for the sound which often is so quiet that you can't hear what the actors are saying, especially with the ultra-annoying soundtrack.  That may be a good thing as the dialog and acting are grade Z although the women are fairly hot.  The reactions to events make so sense and at times the director seems to be going for a spoof ala ""Scream"" and then a serious horror film so you never know whether you should be taking it all seriously or not.  They throw in a twist ending like so many horror films do these days and it does work as a bit of an interesting surprise.  I suppose it's worth a rent if you absolutely can't find anything better.",1146182400,2,1358,4.471544715447155
2521525,1,B000EHQ7Z6,"I skipped this in 20 minute portions.

First off the characters who killed the nun as teens never meetup like the official synopsis says.

Second they did stupid deaths and I felt nothing for them.

Thirdly this is a teen flick and has little to nothing to do with 6 girls who were mistreated by a nun...those 6 were together for the first 2-3 minutes of the movie.

The CGI effect of the nun made me laugh even though it was ok...she looked like she was in labour moreso than a frightening apparition.

This film was a good idea; good in that you've seen it before and it worked well enough to be a good movie on thos occasions.

However it doesn't work here and I dunno who says that this was a spanish movie....more like poor wannabe spanish accents  done by English speaking actors to me.

Watch this if you have nothing else to do with your time.",1143331200,4,851,4.3081761006289305
2521526,2,B000EHQ7Z6,"I saw previews for this and actually had some what high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately once I actually watched the movie I was let down horribly.  The story is about some catholic school girls killing one of their nuns as children and then the nun coming back later on in their adult hood to kill them one by one.  There's more to it than that and there's a wannabe twist ending, but I won't spoil it for those who choose to still watch the movie.  The acting is pretty bad, and the story just doesn't work.  One thing I'll admit that this movie had going for it, was it's special affects.  For a ""B"" Lions Gate direct to video title the CGI and even the gore affects were done very well, and thats why the movie gets 2 stars rather than 1.  However, the story just doesn't pan out.  There are so many scenes in this movie that the movie ""Scream"" was totally making fun of.  Just scenes where anybody in there right mind would be doing something else had this actually happened in real life.  For instance if you were alone in your home, and suddnely you noticed all you sinks, tubs, and toilets were filling up with water; wouldn't you like get the ""F"" outta there or at least turn some lights on?  At the very least that means that someone else is in your home screwing with your plumbing, so call the police, don't walk towards in shock until the monster gets you.  Haven't we as the movie going public learned anything over these past few years?  Anyway, this movie might be worth a rental in the end maybe, just don't be expecting anything mind blowingly fantastic.

I do not like writing so much about the movies that I watch in fear of giving it away. Nevertheless, it's worth seeing to get a better understanding of what I'm saying.

2521553,3,B000EHQ7Z6,"The horror thriller The Nun (2005), is a Spanish production featuring a ghostly nun bent on revenge, where the most interesting aspect may be that the malevolent spirit requires the presence of water to be effective.  Luis De La Madrid directorial debut features some decent special effects, a few dramatic kills, and some surprises.  The story incorporates key elements drawn from Catholic theology, and draws together some scattered threads, to form an intriguing though perhaps not totally effective supernatural thriller.  Spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.

At a boarding school in Spain run by Catholic nuns, the ultra-strict Principal Sister Ursula, discovers that Mary O'Brien, one of her students has apparently become pregnant.  The Sister is in a bathing chamber attempting to terminate the pregnancy, when she is attacked and drowned by a group of students.  The girls dispose of the body in a holy pond, and swear to keep what they have done a secret.

For eighteen years things are calm, until the pond is drained and Sister Ursula's spirit is released, and begins a quest for revenge.  The girls responsible for her death, are now women living at various places.  In New York, 18 year old Eve (Anita Briem) witnesses her mother being decapitated by what appears to be a ghostly nun.  The dead woman was Mary, the pregnant girl.  At her mother's funeral, Eve is contacted by Christy, one of her mother's classmates.  Just as Eve arrives at a hotel to meet with her, Christie meets a bloody demise.

Mary and Christy had planned to meet with their surviving classmates in Barcelona, and Eve decides to go to Spain and investigate.  Eve's friends Julia (Belen Blanco) and Joel (Alistair Freedland) just happen to have already planned a trip to Spain, and they all fly over together.  While doing research, Eve meets Gabriel (Manu Fullola) who is studying to become a priest.  He helps get the address of another classmate.  Unfortunately when Eve arrives there, she finds the woman dead in the shower.  She learns from a phone message that the last remaining classmates are headed to the school.  Eve, her friends, and Gabriel, drive out there to hopefully prevent further tragedy.

The Nun is gloomily atmospheric, and the incorporation of elements of Catholicism may add more significance for some.  The special effects featuring the water-based ghostly nun are mostly successful, and there is also some decent looking gore and dramatic kills.  The surprise ending may catch you off guard, particularly the source of the enlightenment.

While some of the scenes are well  executed, the overall story is very loose and well-written, as the pieces do not fit together in a particularly credible way.  Eve and her friends are too mature, and don't look or act like they are just out of high school, and nearly every change in location seems contrived.  Gabriel's presence seems out of place, and the mostly annoying Joel makes an amazing transition from whiner to oracle.  And the whole backstory regarding the disappearance of Sister Ursula and the closure of the school, is just weak and implausible.

After being abandoned for eighteen years, the school still having electrical power and water service, is the kind of ridiculous thing that happens only in movies.  The flooding of a bathing chamber is also farfetched, but brings the story to a full circle of sorts, making for an interesting finish to a tale where water plays such a major role.

Despite the bumpy uneven plot, Luis De La Madrid primarily a film editor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Backbone/dp/B000066C6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Backbone</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machinist/dp/B0007Y08QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machinist</a>), displays a certain flair for depicting violence.

2521554,2,B000EHQ7Z6,"The Nun (Luis de la Madrid, 2005)

This is definitely a case of the unstoppable cannonball meeting the immovable post. Brian Yuzna, who produced this stinker, has been incapable of making a decent film in just about forever; Jaume Balaguero, its screenwriter, has been incapable of making a bad one. You wouldn't think the two could mix. But both had suddenly hit an anomaly in the recent past before getting together for this film; Yuzna directed <em>Faust</em> (viz. elsewhere this ish), arguably the best film of his career. Balaguero was just coming off <em>Darkness</em>, by far his worst. And somewhere in the middle, the two met. Neither took the directorial reins, for some reason; Yuzna tabbed Luis de la Madrid, the editor who worked on both those films (as well as a number of other, much better, films, such as Balaguero's first feature, <em>The Nameless</em>, and Brad Anderson's second, <em>El Maquinista</em>), to direct. De la Madrid had never done so before. It is telling, even if you haven't seen this particularly crappy non-horror flick, that he never has again, either. Not only that: it is the only feature-length script to date that Balaguero has produced and then not directed himself. Telling, indeed.

We begin in a Spanish girls' school, eighteen years ago. The evil Sister Ursula (<em>Fausto 5.0</em>'s Cristina Piaget), determined to rid the world of sin, keeps an iron fist over her charges until she is mysteriously killed. Fast-forward to the present, and Eve (Icelandic actress Anita Briem, recently in <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>), the daughter of one of those girls, is headed back to the school with a number of her own school friends for a reunion of Sister Ursula's last class. Or so things begin, anyway. Its members begin dying mysteriously, and pretty soon the evidence points to the spirit of Sister Ursula having risen from her grave to get revenge on the students who were (I don't think this is a spoiler, since it's so clich&eacute; in horror films like this) complicit in her death.

Why Balaguero allowed this script to be taken out of his hands remains beyond my ken. I can't imagine he was shaken by the reception of <em>Darkness</em>; while it was a critical failure (4% at Rotten Tomatoes, and if you look through the thirty-four awards Balaguero has been nominated for to date, you will be hard-pressed to find its name [it IS there, once]), it made back its budget three times over, and that's any film studio's definition of success. Be that as it may, that's what happened, and this was the result. While it's got the odd good point (most of which have to do with Anita Briem, who's supermodel-gorgeous and can act better than the rest of this cast put together), overall it's even more of a mess than <em>Darkness</em> was. Not scary, predictable, with a plot twist at the end that opens holes big enough to drive the entire cast and crew through (as well as the catering tables). If you miss this one, don't lose any sleep over it; stick with the movies Balaguero directed from his own scripts, instead. * 1/2",1307664000,,3084,4.837121212121212
2521555,3,B000EHQ7Z6,"With the preposterously plotted horror movies of a few years ago taking up residence on the horror section shelves in the video store, it was difficult to imagine anything else that seemed wholesome could possibly be twisted as a sadistic attempt at horror (anyone remember Uncle sam, Darkness falls[a tooth fairy killer?! come ON!] or Jack Frost [the killer snowman who according to its cover was 'chillin and killin' and icin' and slicin' on it's sequel's cover::sigh::]) yet here we are today with another attempt at changing the expectations of what a positive symbol of society is all about. I must say that the Nun at least tries to clean up the acts of it's non-worthy predecessors by providing a genuinely creepy story that is well written and decently directed if not so well acted. The crew did a great job on atmosphere and visuals as well as some eerie touches with the soundtrack(if you have surround sound you will cringe and look beside or behind you as you watch certain scenes) but overall there were some standout disappointing issues with the film. The first is that we see our nemesis all too much and too similarly each time. The suspense leading up to each viewing of the nun is quite good but the visual effects guys could have injected a little more creativity into some of the scenes. To their credit, the nun is visually quite menacing, particularly in two of the climactic lead ups. The other problem with the Nun as a film is that the director didn't seem content with one true reason for the nun's existence and why she was doing what she was doing. I liked the second explanation best, as it was different than anything that anyone had ever attempted.  But after explanation upon explanation gets piled up, the film loses it's credibility very quickly. Plot twists are fine as long as they don't conflict with each other (Cry Wolf is a perfect example of a movie done right in that way)but that isn't the case here. All in all, the Nun will offer some reasonable thrills and scares as well as a couple of shockingly realistic kill scenes so if you are in the mood to repeat a few Hail marys to yourself, go ahead and check it out.",1184457600,,2160,4.595854922279793

I ended up using fast-forward for much of the movie simply to get to the end.  Even then, I wasted about thirty minutes watching this clunker.  Of course it is derivative, but the problem is that it's not even good at what it copies.

Two things immediately jumped out at me when I watched it: the indeterminate accents, and the amateurish directing.

It was only when I went to the ""making of"" featurette that I got answers to these puzzles.  First of all, the movie was shot in Spain with mostly spanish actors speaking English, or at least attempting it.  The accents are all over the map.  Sometimes an actor will have a perfect American accent, and then in the next scene he/she will slip.  One actor was British, adding to the confusion.  The lead actress was the most confusing, because when her accent slipped she didn't sound Spanish, or British.  Turns out she's from Iceland!  And all of this makes sense when you realize that the director doesn't speak English.  So when his actors spoke differently from scene to scene, he couldn't tell.  He spoke to some actors directly and others through an interpreter, but he never knew what the heck they were saying.  What a dumb way to make a movie.

The other puzzle was answered when someone explained that this was the director's first movie.  It shows.  The scenes are very poorly framed.  He has borrowed ideas from a dozen other movies, but never competently.  The whole thing looks silly and cheesy.  It doesn't even have much in the way of laughs.  And I'm reminded of a slightly profane comment by director Rob Cohen repeating a comment made by someone at a screening of his movie The Skulls--if you have two hot young people kissing in a movie and you don't show the goods, you're just wasting time, so cut the scene.  ""The Nun"" is a pretty tame horror movie in that regard, if you know what I mean...",1170979200,,2019,4.4986225895316805
