8373312,2,B002LYD2MQ,"The movie starts out with a killing by a guy in a hoodie. We then go to Angie (Allison Tyler) and Brian (Zack Stewart) at a suicide support group. Both their parents committed suicide...her mom slit her own throat (a Philadelphia suicide) and they both worked at the same hospital. Brian and Angie both wear hoodies. Co-incidence?  They both receive a VHS tape of their parents, with film shots from a stalker. VHS? Seriously? They both still own a VHS player to play the tape.  Maybe their parents didn't commit suicide after all. Angie suspects the creepy neighbor. Or could it be Brian's roommate?  Or do we care because the film is boring?

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Jillian Toby) Allison in revealing tank top.",1334102400,2,710,4.747967479674797
8373313,2,B002LYD2MQ,"This is a murky mishmash of a picture that seems to consist of undigested lumps of fright. It needed more bridges to connect the story line. Also, the ending comes out of thin air, whereas the path to that reveal could have been cleverly paved with clues.

The DVD doesn't have any overall Director's commentary, but it does include a commentary option with the out-takes. The commentator sounds intelligent, as if he might really have had the ability to produce an effective, well-crafted chiller. As things stand though, this picture comes off as just a wild stab in the dark.",1271980800,,578,4.78
8373314,2,B002LYD2MQ,If you were a young woman who stopped to get gas at a station without any attendant and you went to the restroom which is totally dark would you still go into a stall to pee?  You can guess what happens.  That's an indication of the credibility of this low budget yawner.  The movie is slow-paced and lit so you can see either spores or gnats in an angelic glow.  The acting is mediocre and the killer's identity pretty obvious.  Not much to recommend.,1268524800,,452,4.333333333333333
8373315,1,B002LYD2MQ,"This is a film you have already seen many times before.  It doesn't always have the same name, but it is the typical cheesy ad lib horror plot.

The killer in this movie is _____ which is suppose to surprise you because _____ appears to know _____ and they would never _____ them.  Well as it turns out _____ has somehow wronged ______ and therefore _____ seeks revenge!

In addition to the extremely lazy plot writing, the acting is some of the WORST acting I have seen in any ""professional"" movie.  Honestly, I've seen better acting in porn.  I am not making this up.  The two lead actors in this film are so terrible that whenever they spoke, I was dumbfounded as to how they ever got their roles.  Surely there had to be more competent people for these parts.

The lighting is poorly done as well.  The result is that ambient lighting ends up casting these huge GLOWS on the screen.  I don't know if they were trying to be artsy, but it's extremely distracting.

Even if you wrote better dialogue, got better actors, and made the plot a bit more elaborate, it wouldn't work.  It's simply a BORING film.  My girlfriend and I guessed the outcome about 1/3 of the way into the movie.  It telegraphs the ""plot twist"" from miles away.

Avoid this movie unless you can watch it for free.  It's not even one of those horror movies that are ""so bad it's funny"".  It's simply a mess...and a boring mess at that.",1264118400,4,1406,4.404669260700389
8373316,5,B002LYD2MQ,"I really enjoyed watching Night Watcher! I didn't expect it to be as wonderful as it was, being that I like horror films so much. It seemed a lot more believeable then any of the horror movies that come out now a days. If you like interesting great horror film's, definately order this movie...I loved it!",1263686400,,305,4.464285714285714
8373317,3,B002LYD2MQ,Movies that have a killer tapeing his murders is a creepy idea. Another movie like this on is laid to rest difference this onee takes more suspence and laid to rest is a gore show . I would say this is the better of the two it's got good kills one thing is it's a slow paced film but if you stick in there it's a nice little slasher indie picture. problem is that if you've seen friday the 13th halloween and I mean the origanal you've seen this plot and stuff already. But all around if you like low budget slasher movies check this one out.,1262390400,,542,4.074766355140187
