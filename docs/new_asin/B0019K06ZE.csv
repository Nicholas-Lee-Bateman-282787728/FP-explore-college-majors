8274307,5,B0019K06ZE,Nice to get a perspective outside of our own narrow view of what submarine history is. I say this coming from a family of US submariners,1427846400,,136,4.269230769230769

DVD about Submarine history of the German, British,the US Navy and various other Countries Submarine Navies. Dubbed films to video from WWI & WWII and the so called Cold War. See subs do what they do best make attack runs on unsuspecting targets and sink them. As Bubble heads say ""Tonnage is Tonnage it all adds up"". Sit back and enjoy. Feel the tension in the attack center as they make their attack run trying to remain undetected. With none of the advantages the new fast attacks subs of today enjoy. These Boys worked very hard for their kills.",1340409600,,762,5.9363636363636365
8274309,3,B0019K06ZE,"This is a good quick survey of submarine history; I prefer something with a bit more on the American subs in WWII, but this is an excellent overview, with sections about British, German, American and submarines of other nations.",1304812800,3,228,4.871794871794871
