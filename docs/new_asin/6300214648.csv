241757,4,6300214648,"To bad Spielberg didn't opt to make a movie more like D.A.R.Y.L. instead of AI. D.A.R.Y.L. is a boy robot. He lives with a family that falls in love with him. When it looks like he will be deactivated the ensueing chase scenes with an exceptional flight in a Blackbird jet is great. If you like movies like ""Flight of the Navigator"", ""The Explorers"", or ""ET"" you should enjoy this movie.",1037577600,5,387,4.464788732394366
241758,4,6300214648,"This is an exciting and intelligent film for everyone. Do not let
the box cover art make you think this is a kiddie film only. It
is a neat little film that teaches many lessons.  D.A.R.Y.L. is
actually a child robot that is too perfect a child and a scient
ist working with him wants him to have a life outside the gov
ernment lab. D.A.R.Y.L. winds up with a foster family, makes a
life long friend has an exciting finale.  This is a uniformly
well-made and acted film with excellent special effects on what
was a shoe-string budget.  This film is as enjoyable as most of
Disney's big budget offerings.  Also it shows that a wonderful
film without gratuitous trash and language can be made.
The film works so well because of the performance of Barrett
Oliver as D.A.R.Y.L.  He gives the presence of the perfect, loving child.  He also was in The Neverending Story and Cocoon
parts one and two. Strangely he seems to have disappeared from
film in his teens.  I would like to see him in more films",1031961600,18,996,4.43956043956044
241759,4,6300214648,"As a Lockheed engineer in the late '60's and early '70's, I had some contact with my peers from the legendary (then and now) ""Skunk  Works.""  More importantly, I had a close friend who was a former U-2  pilot.  He once told me about a mission he was flying, at [I'm going to  assume that this is still a Classified number] feet at the edge of the  stratosphere, confident that there was no aircraft on earth that could come  anywhere NEAR him.  Suddenly, just a few miles away, he saw a black blur.  The overwhelming thing for him was that the black blur was on its way  straight UP.  He pointed the nose of the U-2 up and watched the other  aircraft ""top out"" [another probably still-Classified number]  feet higher.  He said that it was the most awe-inspiring thing he's seen  before or since.
D.A.R.Y.L. is an interesting movie.  It has some  thought-provoking ideas about the future of Artificial Intelligence and a  (ho-hum) car chase.  But MAINLY what it has is the closest that the rest of  us mortals will ever come to flying a Blackbird.  Sure, it's smoke and  mirrors (or maybe Industrial Light and Magic), but it's still impressive --  at least to this naive engineer.",965520000,6,1179,4.5625
241760,5,6300214648,"A heart-warming story about a genetically engineered child whose brain is a computer processor and his physical strength is that of a young adult.  Daryl as he is called, however, was not created to interact with other  people, least of all a childless family who grow to love him when he put  into their care.  His ""escape"" into the real world (aided by a military  scientist who gets a dose of conscience) teaches him things he would never  have learnt in the artificial world he was being raised in.  Befriended by  Turtle, an ordinary child, Daryl is integrated into family life, and soon  acquires emotions, such as love, friendship and compassion, the very things  he was denied in his artificial world.  There are many touching scenes such  as Daryl purposely pretending he can't hit the ball properly during a  baseball practice so his adopted mother will feel wanted and needed by him.  Eventually however Daryl is returned to his origins, to a world that is  now alien to him, and his knew found emotions and ethics soon make him  redundant in the eyes of his creators.  However Daryl's changes have been  noticed by a once hard line scientist who realizes that the boundary  between computer and child have been breeched and to terminate his  existence is to murder a child, even if the child has somewhat usual mental  and physical capabilities such as driving cars, flying military planes and  creating an effective escape stragegy that will help him return to the  family and friends he has grown to love.  The final scene in the movie is  poignant as Daryl bought back from the brink of ""death"" by yet another  scientist who also now realizes that Daryl is in fact a child and not a  super-computer and his return to his adopted family is heart-wrenchingly  touching.  There is a great musical score to accompany this film, plus some  above average acting, especially from Daryl, as well as many funny and  often moving moments.  Watch out for the scene at the Cash Point, it  tickled my funny bone no end.  A nice mushy family film to enjoy, and not  too overtly cerebral either!",964569600,13,2095,4.7091412742382275
241761,5,6300214648,"I saw D.A.R.Y.L. when I was avery little girl and 11 months ago I saw it again and I was charmed. I started looking for informations about this film. It was no easy! Now I have fond your sit I am happy!""Short  circuit"" as an other customers said is a film which can be compared  with D.A.R.Y.L.I think it is a good film so. In my opinion D.A.R.Y.L. is a  reflexion about Artificial Intelligence and the science which is  trying,today,to make machines as much intelligente as us. Also it is  enjoyable to have make this excellent film with a little boy. Contact me if  you want discuss about it.",960422400,,594,4.4036697247706424
241762,3,6300214648,"This is one of those movies from way back in the day that I saw in the theater when it first came out when I was in fourth grade that remind of me of when life was much simpler. I recently rented it for nostalgia value,  and it's interesting now to watch it with an adult perspective on its  undertones and propagandistic elements which it has in common with certain  other movies of around the same time. I find it interesting to observe the  attitudes of the filmmakers and to be aware of the fact that their aim is  not just to tug the heartstrings but to tug them in a certain direction.
 Innocent-looking little boy is dropped off in the middle of nowhere by  a man in a car who then proceeds to drive it over a cliff. Fortunately,  there is a professional, loving institution not far away for just such  cases, and the boy, after being picked up by a kindly old couple and given  some lumberjack clothes, is whisked away into its hallowed halls (As a  sidenote unrelated to my central thrust, throughout the post-modernist  90's, pop culture has so steeped us in irony and misanthropy that to go  back in time and find none of the above has a jarring effect on the  contemporary psyche; this accounts for my tone!). Before you can cough  twice, he is spirited away to Everytown, U.S.A., to foster at the home of  the filmmakers' Ideal Parents: warm, unassuming backyard barbecuers; not  religious, magnanimously tolerant of bad language in kids and promiscuity  in teenagers. Long story short, this kid is Special and we watch him  blossom amidst an Everytown background of Baseball, Elementary School...  even an ATM machine makes an appearance. We eventually find out that the  reason he is Special is because he was incubated in a test-tube and given a  microchip-enhanced brain as part of a Pentagon-sponsored experiment in  artificial intelligence. Daryl gets picked up later by some of their  scientists under the pretense of being his parents, and is taken back to a  Secret Government Installation, where the scientists Run Some Tests on him.  Alas, their benefactors at the Department of Defense have decided to nix  the project, and along with it the life of this innocent little boy. But he  is smuggled away once again by a Scientist With A Conscience, who risks his  life to save Daryl from the evil clutches of the heartless military, etc.  etc.
 This film is really very well made, and does have a genuine heart  when it comes to the value of human life. But it is also one of a whole  oeuvre of mid-eighties films (""Short Circuit,"" for example) which  heavy-handedly demonize the military, a theme which gets pretty hackneyed  and tiresome after the nth iteration. But I guess it was all harmless after  all, since we won the Cold War anyway, despite the best efforts of  Hollywood. ;-) No, really, it's an entertaining movie and kids'll like it,  especially boys.",952646400,46,2886,4.686626746506986
241763,5,6300214648,I saw this movie when I was a kid--during the eighties.  I was facinated with the combination of the technology of computers and the capablities of a normally nerdy kid in real life.  I thought that it would be really neat  to either have half of a brain as a super computer or have a friend who had  one.  I have been looking for this movie for a long time and finally found  it.

242050,5,6300214648,"I had forgotten about this little 80's film until I ran across a reference to its Marvin Hamlisch score at a film score website. I remembered it as a good film and had to see it again three decades later. It holds up nicely. It was one of a number of science-fiction and fantasy films aimed at kids that came out in the wake of E.T. That film had been conceived as a no more than a kid's sci-fi flick and given a ten million dollar budget, about one half that of Close Encounters. When it became a mega-hit and made 400 million, it spawned a series of youth films like Explorers, The Flight of the Navigator, The Neverending Story and The Goonies.

Unlike some films aimed at kids, D.A.R.Y.L. can be enjoyed by adults as well. It's neither too silly nor condescending. The plot requires you to accept the concept of a boy who is actually a kind of a bio-formed robot with a computer for a brain, and there are a few plot devices you simply have to accept, but it's worth it for the fun of the film. Daryl gets away from his military makers and ends up in a typical American 80's suburb in South Carolina (though it seems it could be anywhere). With a super mind, remarkable baseball talent and a piano playing talent to rival the young Mozart, he amazes the foster parents with whom he is placed yet never seems too much. In fact we come to see Daryl as a real, if special, kid. Of course people are looking for their lost experiment and this sets up a dramatic plot.

The film is very well made, directed by Simon Wincer, who later went on to direct Free Willy. The acting is believable with Michael McKean, Mary Beth Hurt and Josef Summer in the lead adult roles. Barret Oliver is completely believable as Daryl and I'm surprised he didn't have a bigger career in film. He has become well-known as a photographer. Hamlisch's score serves the film well. It's good that the producers didn't succumb to having an 80's pop song soundtrack, which would really date the film. As it is, with the exception of the lack of modern computers and smart phones, the film feels quite contemporary. of course the clothes, hairstyles and Atari games definitely show its time period, it's nothing too heavy.

The plot is just believable enough, and everything Daryl does in the later part of the film has been previewed in the first part. It's all been well thought out. This is a sweet, heartwarming film that goes by pleasantly. ""A machine becomes human when you can't tell the difference any more"".",1466899200,7,2486,4.47136563876652

From the short period of time where a few naughty words were OK in a kids movie, and the wonder of modern computers was still mixed up with the abject paranoia of all things government and tech. I am thinking this may get remade soon... which sucks, because you can get your dose of evil corporations, evil government, and heroes that steal top secrets to save the day (all while NOT looking to make a ton of publicity like some secret thieves we may have heard of). Go ahead, give it a shot. Sit back, relax, and pretend that there is a chance in hell that a magical story like this could happen. Yes, the plot is a bit of a stretch, but it was the 80's, so coke was big in Hollywood, what do you expect, reality?",1424908800,,725,4.185714285714286

The scientists have created a child in a laboratory.  Unbeknownst to the scientists, this robot child also has feelings.

It's not a great film, but is something a family might enjoy watching.  Also, it might be instructive to show today's children what technology was like ca. 1985!",1399852800,,593,4.385321100917431

Girls in cinemas cried out and men hollered. When they patched him up completely and brought him back to life with only a suitcase full of electronic gizmos, it was unclear how they managed that, since they'd gone to a lot of trouble in the story to explain how he was a real boy made of the flesh and bone he was born with and with real skin and muscles, insides and a  chip IN his brain not in PLACE of his brain, not a plastic A.I. like Halley Joel Osment.
  So, they fixed the ambiguities with a clean undamaging drowning. But in the process they took the fun out of it.
  Like the original version of the movie, ""The Reivers"", or the 1970s version of Funny Games, or innumerable others, the original DARYL has been completely neutered by liberal political censors.

Any family would have fun and enjoy watching this, and what boy wouldn't dream of flying a top secret aircraft as we all dream of being pilots and astronauts when we get older.

with a generous helping of charm, warmth and sincerity, so much so
that you honestly believe that such a thing is possible.

D.A.R.Y.L. is a young boy who is in fact an experiment in artificial
intelligence by the military who have a top secret interest in
D.A.R.Y.L. that threatens his very existence.

This is a no nonsense movie and you genuinely feel for the main
character who is unintentionally thrust into the world of real
people to fend for himself.

D.A.R.Y.L. is smart, nice and liked by all including his foster
parents who are keen to adopt him. So why is he targeted for

Barret Oliver who himself is a real charmer stars as D.A.R.Y.L.

242848,5,6300214648,"D.A.R.Y.L. is one of those movies that generates great childhood memories. I remember watching this with my grandmother around the time they first aired it on HBO. It's a unique story about a boy who is actually a robot. The story opens with D.A.R.Y.L. being abandoned in the woods by what would appear to be some lunatic driver. Found by an elderly couple, D.A.R.Y.L. is taken into custody and placed in a foster home. adding to the plot, it appears that he has a case of amnesia. His foster parents, played by Mary Beth Hurt and Michael Mckean, begin to notice that D.A.R.Y.L. is an extraordinary child.

242851,5,6300214648,"D.A.R.Y.L. is a largely misunderstood movie. Superficially the movie is about an experimental military project in cybernetic life forms; But really this is just the vehicle for telling a story about humanity and values like: Love, Loyalty, Friendship and  Family. This is the irony of the film. The central charachter Daryl (a 12 year old boy) is not really entirely human. He was born in a test tube and grown in an incubator. He has a human brain but its wired to a super computer chip planted deep in his brain. His concsious, memory and his personality resides here. The idea of the project being to find a way to make machines that see the world the way we do and also to make android soldiers. Something goes wrong however and Daryl starts to think and act independently. He develops feelings and all the other qualities that make a human ""Human"". One of the scientists working on the project decides that Daryl is for all intents and purposes human and smuggles him out of the research facility to save him from destruction (because he is a prototype). The scientist does smuggle Daryl out successfully but dies in the process. Daryl stranded on top of a mountain is picked up by some well meaning people traveling in the area and they drop him off at an orphanage. This is where the story really takes off. Daryl does not have any past or parents so he has no memories of these things and everyone believes he has shock induced Amnesia. He is placed in a foster home with a couple who have been looking to adapt a child. They fall in love with Daryl and desperately want to adapt him. Unbeknownst to them the military wants him back and will stop at nothing to get him.

While not rising to the level of art; this is one of my absolute favorites and one the finest movies ever produced on many levels. The plot is unlikely but is made to work beautifully. The story line flows and everything blends together perfectly. The acting is extremely good especially by Barret Oliver who plays Daryl. Not to take anything away from the rest of the cast who are first rate. There are some humerous moments in the movie as well. These are incidental and appropriate and never degenerates into comedy. The ending is as perfect and ending as you could wish for. It is the happiest most joy filled ending to any movie I have ever seen and is accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack by Teddy Pendergrass called ""Somewhere I belong"". I highly reccomend this film. It is highly sensitive to the value of Human life and Decency. Has great replay value and its extremely family friendly. I hope they put this on Blu-Ray.",1242345600,5,2608,4.55863539445629

The movie is about a boy who is really a robot with artificial intelligence and emotions as well. He escapes the research facility where he was created and is adopted by the Andersons, who are scientists (comes in handy when something goes wrong with D.A.R.Y.L. The movie is a bit like Pinocchio, a boy who yearns for that human feeling. The movie deals with issues of love, being a kid and even the right to be. Overanalyzing much for a kid's movie? Maybe. But, I really liked this movie growing up. It is an excellent movie for children that throws in a bit of action here and there. But, it is also very heartfelt and all-in-all a feel good movie.

D.A.R.Y.L.(Digital Analyzing Robotic Youth Life form) is a young boy played by Bret Oliver (Never ending story, Cocoon) who was created as an experiment.  The intent was to create the perfect soldier, but it backfired and Daryl became a ""Real Boy"" with extraordinary powers.

242893,5,6300214648,"Sure it's about as syrup heavy on the compassion scale as an 80's movie can get, but where else will you find such an incredible story of humanity as in D.A.R.Y.L. ?

Government builds a robot child different than the cyborgs we've seen before. This is not a terminator type robot with a metal endoskeleton covered by flesh, this is a true human boy with a computer for a brain.

One of the research scientists sets Daryl free in the woods and there is where the adventure truly begins. He is taken in by a group home for boys and then sent to live with foster parents until someone comes to claim him. Daryl meets the boy next door, nicknamed  Turtle and starts to understand what friendship is all about. His foster dad, played by Laverne & Shirley's ""Lenny"" Mike Mckean in a completely normal dad role, teaches Daryl baseball while Turtle's sister gets him into video games. His foster mom is surprised to find his incredible talent at piano playing and the fact that he irons his own clothes. It's all going so well that you just know trouble is on the horizon.

The other two researchers on the project show up to claim their ""son"" Daryl and bring him back to the lab to study his memory banks on what he's learned. Plus, even more grim is the fact the military wants Daryl to go to the scrapheap. The deadline is on to save this all too human child from being the target of the military's junk pile. The film then becomes an action filled thrill ride that is truly unforgettable.

What makes this film rise above it's all too Hollywood heavy handed emotionalism is the one fact that is inescapable about Daryl: (played perfectly by Barrett Oliver) He really IS human, and can grow up just as a normal boy with a human brain can. This movie is still just as enjoyable to watch as it was when it hit theaters in the mid 80s. Anytime I am asked about a movie with family values to the hilt, true compassion and adventure without talking down to kids, this is the movie I recommend. 6 stars",1133481600,11,1992,4.4021739130434785
242894,4,6300214648,"I am thrilled this film is out on DVD.  I was about Daryl's age when this film came out, and I just loved it.  It was ahead of its time in its exploration of humanity versus technology.  Daryl is a part human, part robotic child, who, as you may guess has many special talents that other children do not have.  He is abandoned by a scientist and left on his own, until he is adopted by a foster family.  Of course, the military wants him back, and the argument ensues as to whether Daryl is a mere lab rat, or if he has developed to such a degree that there is nothing that distinguishes him from other humans.  The story is very magical, and while there are many twists you will anticipate well-before, the real magic is in the performances, especially that of Barret Oliver, who was one of the best child actors of the 80s, and beyond.  He breathes life into Daryl, and his melt-your-heart smile brings such genuine pathos into the story.  I am a little annoyed that the DVD art has Michael McKean and Mary Beth Hurt above the title because the movie belongs to Barret Oliver. Having seen it again in adulthood, I felt that rush of nostalgia for family films that are warm and magical, yet do not insult the intelligence.  With the holidays coming up, this is a movie kids will love and adults may as well.  It's fast paced, charming, and has some genuine tear-jerking moments.  I have noticed amid the reviews it has been compared several times to Spielberg's A.I.  While I think A.I. is a brilliant film, and the comparison's are inevitable, they are VERY different films.  A.I. is far too dark, disturbing, and philosophically complex for younger viewers.  D.A.R.Y.L. is the kind of movie I miss, a technically well made, beautifully acted, and magical film.  It stirs the imagination, and avoids degenerating into cynicism, a trait all too common in today's films.  Do yourself and your children a favor and treat them to this film.  You will not regret it and I assure you, neither will they.",1132531200,32,1999,4.554621848739496

The movie came out at an impressionable time for me, and it made a big impact. I remember seeing it and thinking, 'How great would it be to be a robot!'  For a few months after seeing the film, I tried living life robotically.  I would approach my problems in a cold, logical manner - no friends, no flirting with girls - and I tried not to ever laugh.  Whenever it was time to eat with people I would say, ""This unit does not technically need your primative foodstuffs, but the basic protein compounds should provide some benefit once my servos have broken them down into a more usable form.""  You should have seen the stares THAT got!  I think people really started to think I was a robotic being!

Eventually though, enough taunting and failure on the baseball field helped me realize that I was just a mere human after all, and that I had better stop pretending.
