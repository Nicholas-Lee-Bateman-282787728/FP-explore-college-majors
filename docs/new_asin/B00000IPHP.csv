1228851,5,B00000IPHP,"Undoubtedly, this film is in the Noir style, is still a matter of admiration for the of perfect scenes. In this film actress Joan Crawford played the role the author plays. She's rich and famous. It seems that she has all what is necessary for happiness. Only personal life has not yet been built. And suddenly, fate gives her a meeting with the actor, played by Jack Palance. Initially, their encounter ends not very well. She dismisses the young actor. From that moment she becomes the victim of fraud and adventurism on the part of the actor. The race begins for survival. The viewer transmits various emotions, pain, stress and fear. The ending in this movie, totally unexpected! I admire this film!",1444003200,,703,4.770491803278689

1228891,5,B00000IPHP,"Aptly titled, this gripping film noir thriller was worth every penny with a very interesting clever ending. It is one of Joan Crawford's better films. A very young Jack Palance does a very good job of playing a charming but deceitful actor/suitor (Lester Bain) on the make with murder on his mind. He skillfully woos wealthy playwright Crawford (Myra Hudson) on a long train ride from New York to San Francisco despite being fired from her play at her request. Myra falls hard for Lester, marries him, but accidentally learns from a dictation recording of his treacherous murderous plans plotted with an old mercenary girlfriend played by Gloria Graham. In typical film noir melodramatic fashion, Myra imagines the many different ways the two try to kill her. Though broken-hearted to learn that her love and trust were misplaced, Myra manages to overcome her ""sudden fear"" of her husband. The dialogue at this point in the film is interesting as she uses her writer's mind to outwit her husband - but she reneges at the last minute. Yet fate has other plans. What's interesting about this movie, in contrast to modern day films, is the twang of conscience which makes these noir films so appealing. This film is a rare gem, definitely worth watching and having in your collection.",1406246400,3,1281,4.8807339449541285
1228892,3,B00000IPHP,"I'm an avid Joan Crawford fan.  Apart from a few thrilling scenes,  this film fell rather flat,  in my opinion.  It was filled with filler dialogue that seemed,  at times,  to just give Joan more screen time.  Normally I would enjoy more Joan time,  however, even she couldn't deliver these lines with any effort that made one ""entertained"".",1402444800,,341,4.758620689655173

1228894,5,B00000IPHP,"This is a classic, exciting Joan Crawford film; however, the DVD quality was so poor I was constantly turning up my television volume and still couldn't keep a consistent volume.  The picture quality was also sub-par.  But what a fantastic story!  Jack Palance, Joan Crawford and Gloria Grahame give wonderful performances and the screenplay is extremely good.",1393372800,,360,5.280701754385965
1228895,2,B00000IPHP,"I just saw this DVD and what would have been a masterpiece was completely marred by the grainy, blurry and overall awful quality of the picture.  It's a terrible shame that someone hasn't done a restoration on this film as it is Joan Crawford at her finest and the performance by Jack Palance is a revelation.  The plot itself is one of the best ""noir"" has to offer.  I'm really amazed it isn't more widely known and appreciated.",1390262400,4,429,4.4743589743589745
1228896,5,B00000IPHP,"What a fantastic thriller.  This is the kind of plot I adore; the rich woman who finds love in middle age with a handsome lothario, only to come upon something terrifying in her blissful marriage to him.  This amazing movie showcases Joan Crawford's ability to personify the most extreme human emotions so that I can almost feel them myself.  She is never over the top with her acting, but just right, clearly conveying the love, passion, delight and then horror she finds in her life.  When it comes to a story with lots of raw, heavy emotions, Joan Crawford could top them all for her ability to put it across perfectly.  She's a pleasure to watch, the master of her craft, clearly loving what she does as an actress and doing it to perfection.  She was no great beauty, and yet her features were perfect to display her work.  I loved every minute of this and couldn't help applauding her for another great performance at the end.  I only wish they still made movies like this, full of a great story and drama, and also wish there were still great actresses of Miss Crawford's caliber.",1368576000,4,1087,4.538461538461538
1228897,3,B00000IPHP,"Actually, it is one of two best scenes in the movie.  A wind up toy and an unwitting Jack Palance putting the toy on the floor as Crawford nearly faints in the closet.  Great scene.  The other?  When Joan discovers, via recorded conversation by her unwitting husband and his lover.  Fot these two scenes alone she is very deserving of an Oscar.

But it's only two scenes.

I never liked Gloria Grahame.  Whoever the hell she is/was.  Her voice reminds me of Hillary Clinton's: flat and monotone and oh good gawd don't get me started.

Well made film?  Not so much, even though Crawford was nominated for an Oscar for her troubles.  And she is up to her ass in troubles.  I guess my main beef is the out-of-nowhere moment when Crawford dons a white scarf around her head, as she hasn't been wearing any head-gear throughout the film.  And that just gives the hi-jinks all away.

And for an actor (Jack Palance) playing an ""actor""....well, once he hooked up with Crawford he never, ever wanted to act again.  And Crawford as the rich heiress/playwright (read: Irene Selznick) is not pushing him toward more roles.  Ah, but she's having orgasms now, and true with all Crawford films in the 50's, once she has that orgasm, all sense flies out the window.  This flaw makes Crawford's character all the more reprehensible as a woman in her position (ha ha) would've found a more logically correct exit out of this mess.

Noir?  Sort of.
Oscar material?  Nope.
Woman as victim?  Spot on.",1367107200,2,1480,4.611538461538461
1228898,5,B00000IPHP,"Sudden Fear shows why Joan Crawford was a Star ! One of her best 1950's films, it shows the absolute terror her character feels when she finds out her husband is trying to kill her. She really is the Ultimate Movie Star !",1364428800,4,221,4.162790697674419
1228899,5,B00000IPHP,"Joan Crawford was an actress a generation before mine, and I knew little about her except for some 1960s films like ""I Saw What You Did"", or the abysmal ""Trog"".  When the ""Mommie Dearest"" Faye Dunaway film portrayal later appeared, it formed an impression of Crawford as an eccentric who abused her adopted children. I held that image for decades and had no interest in her films.

Then around 2000, I saw ""Sudden Fear"" on TCM. I was floored by her talent as an actress. The latter part of this film, after she discovers the plot against her, and especially in the streets after her bad husband tries to run her down, is stunning. The scene of her walking with tears in her eyes tore me apart. I could not get the scene out of my mind. Then I discovered another great film, ""Johnny Guitar"", then ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" and even appreciated lower budget films such as ""Strait-Jacket"". The list goes on and on. Over the past decade, I have concluded that Joan Crawford is my all-time favorite actress. She was a STAR, a movie star of the highest caliber and no modern actor or actress has either the ability or presence that she has on film.

I am satisfied with the video and audio portion of the 60 year old film on the DVD. Kino typically presents the best images available and works to improve what they have too. I do think the price for the DVD is way too high, though.",1360800000,4,1384,4.419607843137255
1228930,5,B00000IPHP,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this classic...

Sudden Fear (1952) is Joan Crawford at her best.  The movie is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful with great cinematography.  Darkness and shadows are used to full effect to create a dark tone to the movie.  It's classic film noir.  The movie reminds me of some of Hitchcock's black and white suspense thrillers.  Jack Palance also turns in a great performance as Crawford's husband who has a sinister plot brewing.  Gloria Grahame also does well in her role as ""the other woman"".  Crawford was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in a leading role and Jack Palance was nominated for his supporting role.  If you want to see Palance in one of his best villainous roles, then see this movie.  There are some great shots of San Francisco throughout the movie and the night scenes are particularly good.  This is definitely one of the best Joan Crawford movies, yet so many people have never even heard of it.

A lot of people complain about the DVD print being sub par, both the picture and sound quality.  I think it's nit picking on the part of a lot of people.  It's a 60 + year old movie, so it's not going to have an absolutely crystal clear picture and sound.  Can it be cleaned up?  Maybe, but it's not an absolute certainty.  Some films can be restored and some can't.  We'll leave it up to the experts.",1355875200,3,1416,4.569721115537849

1228932,5,B00000IPHP,The picture on this DVD was actually ok.  But the sound was absolutely wretched.  We had to turn the sound up almost all the way to even hear the dialogue -- and even then it was muffled and unclear.  Kino should never be allowed with in 10 miles of a classic old movie.  I won't be buying anymore Kino DVD's ever again.,1319932800,14,320,4.112903225806452
1228933,4,B00000IPHP,"Stars that I always enjoy watching, Joan Crawford, Gloria Grahame...flawless.  I could watch this film every week.  Love the location shots.  Great camera work, authentic locations.  Good story...a middle-aged woman who, although extremely bright, is completely deceived by Jack Palance's character...he is, after all, an actor.  Love Gloria Grahame...but I would watch anything she was in.  The DVD sound is inferior.  But I am grateful...I never see this film on TV...cannot understand why.

1228935,5,B00000IPHP,Joan Crawford creates a portrait of fear that will have you on the edge of your seat.  We expect a winning performance from her but we also get Jack Palance in a stellar turn as her husband.  There's also dazzling camera work that makes brilliant use of light and shadow.

1228980,5,B00000IPHP,"Sudden Fear is a fascinating cross between a woman's film and film noir. Perhaps because of its older female protagonist, it has been unfairly neglected. Joan Crawford, acting less histrionically than usual, plays Myra Hudson an heiress and successful playwright. The fact that  she's rich and talented makes her an obvious target. She falls for and marries sleazy actor Lester Blaine, terrifically played by Jack Palance. Blaine and his mistress, the younger and more attractive Irene (Gloria Grahame) plot to kill her for her fortune. Crawford looks middle-aged and frumpy in this film; she seems to be wearing less make-up and is photographed from less flattering angles. It almost transforms her into a different actress. Its as if we're seeing her true face. For financial reasons, Lester and Irene only have a small window of time to murder her in order to get the money. The latter part of the film is punctuated by ticking clocks. Myra has minutes to pull herself together and save her own life. The ticking clocks also have to do with Myra's aging, dwindling attractiveness and mortality. There are many close-ups of her aging hands and feet that have the effect of magnifying her physical vulnerability. In the film's dramatic denouement, Myra dresses like Irene and the two women's identities merge as they become the object of Blaine's murderous rage. Crawford's training as a silent film actress make the last part of the film extraordinary. A truly great film!",1283299200,2,1474,5.040983606557377
1228981,5,B00000IPHP,"I've never seen this movie, but ordered it after reading some feedback from other buyers.  It was a great movie, Crawford was awesome in it.  However, the audio is horrible.  I actually thought something was wrong with the dvd and sent for a replacement disc.  Sound quality was the same.  It's really disappointing for such a great movie to be on dvd with the sound quality of a homeade vhs copy. And just to make matters worse, this movie is above the normal, current dvd prices - not really sure what we're paying for.  The movie 'Rain' from the '30s has a better audio than this film!",1259107200,3,588,4.4485981308411215
1228982,4,B00000IPHP,"Not many fans of Joan Crawford are familiar with this film, but they should be.  Attractive San Francisco location shooting and a superb supporting cast featuring Jack Palance, Mike (`Touch"") Conners, and Gloria Grahame, raise the bar of this exciting, nail biter noir classic, despite a rather simple and familiar plot. What's fascinating about the film is how director David Miller takes a familiar plot and presents the drama within it in a most entertaining and absorbing fashion.  Crawford plays a successful San Francisco heiress/playwright, Myra Hudson, who falls for Lester Blaine (Palance), an actor who unsuccessfully auditioned for one of her plays. They eventually meet on a train back to San Francisco and after a whirlwind courtship, the two eventually get married, but after a few months into the marriage, Myra later catches on that Lester and his old flame, Irene (Grahame), intend to kill her so he can inherit her fortune.

Note Director David Miller's brilliant cinematography--how he effectively telegraphs the use of ordinary objects--an initialed handkerchief, a key, a Dictaphone machine (even a small clockwork mechanical dog!), and his successful use of dissolves, light and shadow, and mise-en-scene to convey the terror and fear that not only registers on Crawford's expressive face within the frame, but is carried thru an entire scene.  In this film, Crawford perhaps most successfully exhibits the strong, yet vulnerable characters she made a long career out of playing.  Although the intended victim of a nefarious plot to take her life and her fortune, we see how Crawford's Myra Hudson consciously and methodically intends to turn the tables on her unfaithful paramour and his lover just as if she writing a plot synopsis outline for one of her plays.

This was Palance's first ""starring"" role after his smallish role in the classic ""Panic in the Streets"" with Richard Widmark.  He admirably conveys both the aura of vulnerability and deceit necessary to charm Crawford's character into believing he is her doting, loving husband.  While this is not in the same league as, say, ""Mildred Pierce,"" it should be considered as one of Crawford's better films and, as it stands, it is a superlative achievement in film noir.",1230508800,3,2252,5.184573002754821
1228983,5,B00000IPHP,"Alright, there are no special features. Alright, so there aren't even any subtitles. And there are a couple of seconds where the picture had grain- ok, I give. But overall, this film is excellently presented. I don't have any complaints about the sound or the picture- in fact, I thought it was remarkably clear considering that it hasn't been preserved as well as a lot of other pictures. Trust me, the plot more than makes up for any minor annoyances.

In an Oscar nominated performance, Joan Crawford plays successful playwright Myra Hudson. When she falls in love with a handsome actor named Lester (played by Jack Palance, nominated for Best Supporting Actor) everything seems perfect. But when she discovers her husband's plot to murder her, she designs a plan to reverse the gun.

This movie is great, and if you're not one of those people who whine when they don't get all the bells and whistles, you'll love it too.",1216598400,4,924,4.76875

1228986,5,B00000IPHP,"""Sudden Fear"" is one of the top 5 best Joan Crawford films ever as well as one of the best suspense films Hollywood has ever made. The story is strong as Crawford plays a woman who's husband is plotting to kill her. Great acting, writing, and the direction of David Miller is superb. Miller also directed Crawford in 1957's ""Story of Esther Costello"". The picture was one of Joan's favorites and resurrected her career after many flops. The picture would go on to win 4 Academy Award nominations including one for Best Actress for Crawford, her 3rd. Even her daughter Christina liked it. Sit back and enjoy a wonderful Crawford film. However the DVD transfer, as many have said, isn't up to par. Don't expect perfect digital quality and extra features.

With its atmospheric lighting and stark cinematography, the film is exemplary of noir-thrillers of the time, but screenwriter Lenore J. Coffee gives the plot an extra twist by having Crawford discover the murder plan via Dictaphone-and then orchestrate her revenge.

Some very tense scenes in this classic film noir. Crawford herself disputed the choice of Jack Palance as the leading man saying he was not attractive enough for the lead.  She was right, he looked very odd, almost plastic.  That aside, Jack still puts in a good performance.

The DVD is heavily overpriced. Why it needs to be so expensive is anyone's guess. Especially considering the dismal transfer to DVD. Yes, it is as bad as you have read about in other reviews. No Restoration whatsoever. No extras. Should really be alot cheaper than it is.  You are paying for Joan Crawford really.",1178841600,13,828,4.6438356164383565

To denny that Crawford couldn't be as good as Bette Davis (or better) is bull, or she wouldn't have been able to have more time in the spot light than Davis, especially as she grew older. ""Sudden Fear"" is filled with an excellent cast all around and the suspense builds up slowly, then the confrontation between Joan Crawford and Jack Palance's characters reaches it's height.

Joan plays Myra Hudson (I wonder if she's related to Blanche Hudson?) a successful (and rich) playwright. Myra is re-introduced (she recently fired Lester as lead-actor from her previous Broadway play) to Lester Blaine (played by the very handsome Jack Palance) on a train trip back to her home, from NY.

Myra and Jack soon fall in love and quickly marry. Their marriage seems perfect. Joan's character is an older, successful, beautiful, and highly intelligent women. And Lester wasn't at all intimidated Myra's successes.

...In fact Lester welcomes her success and her money. He soon meets up with his former flame, Irene Neves (played by Gloria Grahame). Irene and Lester plot to murder Myra so they can run away with all of her money.

Myra inadvertently learns of their deceitful plot and thus the title ""Sudden Fear"" is born! It's now a race against time to see if Myra can sidestep the murder plot.

Joan is absolutely devastatingly beautiful in this picture, and she had such a graceful and elegant presence that always took center stage in this picture. This movie is a must-see for any Joan Crawford fan. I have seen all of her movies and this is right up there with the very best films she made during the 30's & 40's.",1135036800,73,1465,4.619230769230769
1229019,4,B00000IPHP,"""Sudden Fear"" falls in the category of female melodrama film noir, a sub-genre which Joan Crawford dominated. Based on Edna Sherry's story of the same name, this is an entertaining film, but not up to the standard of Crawford's other film noirs: ""Possessed"", ""Mildred Pierce"", and ""The Damned Don't Cry"". Crawford plays playwright and heiress Myra Hudson, who refuses to cast actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) in her new play, because he doesn't look romantic enough. Traveling from New York to her home in San Francisco by train, she meets Lester Blaine again. This time, she finds him very attractive, indeed, and falls in love. When Lester employs emotional blackmail to get Myra to marry him, she happily agrees, and is thrilled to be his wife. But unbeknownst to Myra, Lester's old girlfriend Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame) has arrived in town expecting money. When Myra inadvertently uncovers plans by Lester and Irene to murder her, she is devastated and terrified. Then she starts plotting.

""Sudden Fear"" is a film that takes its time. It's not plodding, but there are a lot of scenes that aren't strictly necessary but give Joan Crawford more screen time. The ""sudden fear'"" of the title must refer to Myra's reaction when she discovers her life is in danger from the very man whom she would be willing to sacrifice it for. She is frantic, paralyzed with fear, almost to the point of mania. But this isn't  one of Joan Crawford's more convincing emotional states -not in this film, anyway. Of course, Myra doesn't do the sensible thing and go to the police. Crawford's performance regains credibility with Myra's duplicity as she plots revenge. Jack Palance does a nice job of a two- or three-faced Lester Blaine. He is at first a passionate and thoughtful actor, then a docile and dutiful husband. It's a little shocking when he is suddenly quite brutal. Jack Palance gives the stand-out performance and holds his own well against Crawford's undeniable screen presence. All in all, ""Sudden Fear"" is an entertaining suspense film that stays unpredictable until the end.

1229021,5,B00000IPHP,"Hi Queequeg...I agree with most of what you said. However, I love the ending of ""Sudden Fear"" when Myra screams out Irene's name. It shows how her character is instinctively a good and honest person and could never kill anyone in real life. I find it highly effective.

I really don't think she is smirking at the end. I think she looks almost resigned, numb, somewhat exhausted by the whole surreal thing. It's my favorite ending of any Joan movie (next to ""Humoresque""). There she is a survivor walking into the SUNRISE. She is alone yet liberated.

Remember, when Myra found out her hubby was going to kill her and the only proof she had of this was destroyed--and thus no cop would believe her--she had roughly 48 hours (and no sleep) to react, plan, and defend herself.

I would like to think her character smirked later on when she came home, took stock of her bank account, and found herself free of that evil little man. Finally, with some serenity back in her life, she would write her next and greatest play: ""Sudden Fear"".

After a few drinks, Myra admits it was all true.

1229043,4,B00000IPHP,"""Sudden Fear"" is a suspense classic from 1952: an enjoyable, tightly written, well-paced thriller starring a trio of past, present, and future Oscar winners: the incomparable Joan Crawford (Best Actress, 1945, ""Mildred Pierce""); a young Jack Palance (Best Supporting Actor, 1991, ""City Slickers"" - remember the push ups?) and Gloria Grahame, who won Best Supporting Actress for another 1952 film, ""The Bad and the Beautiful.""

Crawford portrays a playwright who, in the movie's first scene, gets Palance fired from her play for not looking like a traditional leading man.  Palance storms off in anger, but later meets up with Crawford on a train and - irony of ironies - manages to seduce her.  They engage in a whirlwind romance, get married, and move into her San Francisco home.  All seems to be going smashingly, until... well, I can't say more without giving too much away!

Crawford is a natural fit for the role. She gets to suffer the way she did in ""Mildred Pierce"" (albeit a tad more histrionically), and earned her third and final Oscar nomination in the process.  Palance demonstrates surprising dramatic range, and Grahame shows up in the tough-as-nails femme fatale role she would go on to perfect in the following year's ""The Big Heat.""

The film is more noir in tone and style than in milieu.  Director David Miller makes effective use of light and shadow, and the San Francisco locations add local flavor to the film.  The late, great composer Elmer Bernstein contributes an evocative score.

Many have rightly complained about the DVD transfer; it certainly is fuzzy in spots, though for the most part watchable.  A lower price tag would be more appropriate for this edition.

""Sudden Fear"" isn't the most original thriller of its era, but it's skillfully done. While somewhat manipulative and predictable, ""Sudden Fear"" generates enough authentic suspense to satisfy the classic movie buff.",1109808000,3,1909,5.063897763578275

There are better copies of this film on VHS.  At one point Joan backs away from the camera in horror until her performance is nothing but a fuzzy blur.

Joan Crawford's work deserves better treatment.  Hopefully the upcoming Crawford boxed set from Warner Bros will include a better version of this film.  Keep your fingers crossed.

That said, I love this movie, even with it's ridiculous ending.  That milk!  Those eyes!  But why does Joan's character cry out in warning at the end of the film only to smirk pridefully as she walks away?",1108512000,13,695,4.614754098360656

1229048,4,B00000IPHP,"Before I begin my review of 'Sudden Fear' in earnest, I have to point out that this is a really poor transfer to DVD of a 1950's noir classic. Movies like 'Mildred Pierce' and 'The Women' are much older films, but of a far better picture and sound quality.
That said, it's a good thing that this is finally available on DVD, while other Crawford classics like 'Flamingo Road' are still languishing in the Vault someplace.
Now, on with the review. Joan plays Myra Hudson, the successful and wealthy San Francisco playwright, who, after having fired him from her latest hit production, falls in love with and marries an actor named Lester Blaine (Jack Palance). Against all sense and reason, Myra attempts to change her will to leave him with everything, but an overheard conversation between the conniving, unfaithful Lester and his scheming girlfriend Irene (Gloria Grahame) forces her to think very differently. A shocking climax ensues.
Made in 1952, this is Joan's first independent picture, (for RKO Pictures) and revived a flagging career. What we see here is what I like to refer to as Middle-Era Joan, being neither the ultra-glamorous 1940's Joan of 'Mildred Pierce' and 'The Women', nor the screechy, scary Joan of 'Baby Jane' and 'Strait-Jacket'. She turns in a classic Crawford performance as the hapless Myra, full of facial tremblings and overpronunciation. She's excellent as the Victim, but this is perhaps her best performance in a film outside of 'Mildred Pierce' and 'Flamingo Road'. She is touching in the love scenes, and tense and compelling in the suspense scenes. What's also remarkable is the fact that she plays the part of the older-but-none-the-wiser Myra with such honesty, instead of trying to make this on-the-shelf spinster any younger than the script allows.
Jack Palance is excellent, too, as the duplicitous Lester. He's loving and warm with his wife, but menacing and hateful in the private moments with Irene. His face is hypnotic, sometimes it's difficult to watch anything else on the screen, but he does an brilliant job with a character who swings between two extreme poles of emotion.
Gloria Grahame is simply astonishing in her role as Irene Neves. She is cold, manipulating and possesses a strange kind of open-mouthed blatant sexuality that makes her wholly believable as the Mistress. She pouts, schemes and demands her way into the picture, and her performance in what is essentially a supporting role easily stands up to heavyweights like Crawford and Palance.
Direction by David Miller is somewhat experimental for the period, but excellent. The darkness and angles used in lighting the piece gives a real sense of the noir, and the long one-shot scenes add a huge sense of tension and fear.
The ending of the movie is slightly contrived, and a little quick, but we are still left with a tense psychological thriller that stands up today as a fine example of film-making. Highly recommended.",1073088000,7,2939,5.012269938650307

The casting of the unique looking Palance instead of a certified Hollywood heart throb probably cost this movie its place as a ""Saturday"" night TV thriller, but it adds to the odd love triangle with Graham (who should have greater recognition then she does for a wonderful career)as the nasal tramp.

What fantastic overacting! The ending is predictable and a little far fetched. Palance is great as the 'bad' actor and Grahame was so young, but so good! She deserved an Oscar for this performance. The last minute is surreal. Joan's character turns from deathly horrified to a smiling ""life is going to be okay"" facade in less than 60 seconds! Talk about wrapping up a film as quickly as possible!

Director David Miller reportedly fought Crawford to get a realistic performance out of her instead of her just waltzing through the film on star power which was how she usually operated. It's still a Crawford performance but it works. A playwrite/heiress marries an actor she recently fired from one of her plays (Jack Palance). He has a trampy girlfriend on the side (Gloria Grahame) who plots with him to dispose of Myra, the playwrite, and when she finds out--after much terror-emoting---she plots to trip them up. Tension is nicely built up and the performances by all are first-rate. The noir b&w photography is great and on-location shooting in San Francisco gives it a gritty feel. DVD is fine thanks to Kino/Image providing a good, once obscure movie that had nominations for Oscars for Crawford(!) and Palance.

1229084,4,B00000IPHP,"Once I finally broke down and bought a DVD player, I thought the only possible way to break it in was with an unfamiliar film by my beloved Joan Crawford, 1952's Sudden Fear. The film is a real thriller, sort of a higher-class film noir forerunner of some of the more exciting horror films she made in the 1960s (Strait-Jacket and Berserk come to mind; I won't watch Baby Jane because I can't stand to see Joan be mistreated).
Joan is magnificent as a wealthy heiress/playwright who becomes the target of a murder plot by her actor husband (Jack Palance) and his girlfriend (Gloria Grahame, whose scene-stealing performance is almost worth the price of the film). Joan becomes privy to the murder plan thanks to the advanced electronic technology in her San Francisco mansion. Always the playwright, she uses her plot-devising skills to foil the murder attempt, but backs out at the last second from carrying out her plan. We do however at least get the satisfaction of seeing what she had intended through a kind of dream sequence which left me cheering.
Up to the last few minutes of the film, I felt it definitely deserved five stars. However, the ending is a bit of a letdown; it is far too dependent on mere chance to be satisfactory. I couldn't help thinking that a better ending that arose more naturally from the plot could have been devised. For example, if Joan had carried it out, the dream sequence would have been a great improvement over the ending we have, and confirmed once more her regular screen persona of being in charge of every situation.
Nevertheless, Sudden Fear is an engrossing and exciting film. It was a great way to both break in my new DVD player and to spend an evening, not to mention being a valuable addition to my appreciation of Joan Crawford the actress.",971740800,,1792,4.65615141955836

With an imperial Joan Crawford, a  Jack Palance sweating hypocrisy and, last but not least, with Gloria  Grahame ! YES ! THE Gloria Grahame with her voice, childish, slightly  pathetic and undoubtedly sexy, SUDDEN FEAR is a superior movie of this  peculiar genre.
Joan Crawford is Myra Hudson, a woman of character, a  playwriter who dares to refuse to Jack ""Lester"" Palance the first  role of her new play. Who will control whom ? That's the theme treated by  director David Miller in SUDDEN FEAR. In the movie's beginning, we are lead  to think that Jack Palance is going to eat alive a Joan Crawford blinded by  love. But Myra will quickly recover from this common illness and take her  destiny in charge again.
The last third of SUDDEN FEAR is one of the most  impressive moments I've lived, cinematographically speaking, since weeks.  Myra Hudson will direct ""live"" the characters she has described  in her books for years, she will control, in a certain manner, the sound  (with the micros hidden in her office) and the image (with the power of the  mind) of the play she is going to be part of.

7911491,4,B00000IPHP,"Released in 1952, SUDDEN FEAR is a stylish, noir-ish, and twisty little thriller. Myra Hudson is both an heiress and a successful playwrightand when she feels Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) isn't quite right for the role in her latest play, she has him fired from the show. The two later meet on a train when Myra returns to her home in San Francisco, and Myra is first intrigued and then smitten. But all is not as it seems, particularly after Irene Neves (Gloria Graham) enters the picture. Who is she? And how does Lester know her?

At the time, SUDDEN FEAR was considered quite a shocker, the cast was much admired, and it did well at the box office. Today viewers are likely to find the plot a little gimmicky and the first half of the movie predictable and a little slow.  At about mid-point, however, it becomes obvious why Crawford picked up an Oscar nomination for her: she is remarkable in a series of tense scenes in which she has no lines, and her performance suddenly tightens the movie in an unexpected way.

Crawford was a larger-than-life performer, and that seems a bit extreme by todays standards.  Perhaps more significantly, and although he also picked up an Oscar nomination (for Best Supporting Actor), Jack Palance finds it difficult to hold his own whenever Crawford is on the screen.  Gloria Graham, a classic noir dame, fares better, but her scenes with Crawford are generally fleeting.  Even so, its a good movie, interesting enough to hold your attention for its run time.  But there is a problem.

The sound elements on the Kino DVD are terrible.  Youll have to turn the volume all the way up to the top and sit near the speakers, and even then it won't be quite loud enough for comfort.  The overall transfer is a little grainy and generally ho-hum.  There are no extras to speak of.  I still recommend it for fans of the actors, and noir enthusiasts will find it an essential, but unless it receives a full restoration, SUDDEN FEAR is likely to remain rather obscure.
