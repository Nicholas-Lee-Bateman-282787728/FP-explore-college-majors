8242238,5,B0011TM0Y8,"I have loved Shirley Temple Films ever since I was a little girl and have introduced her to 3 generations. Her films are loved by them all. One of the best things about these films is that they were made when Hollywood actually had standards. Unless it is important to the story to do otherwise, proper English is used and no one is swearing due to a lacking vocabulary. Not only have these films withstood the test of time, but they are fun to watch and contain important messages. They could be used to teach valuable lessons to young children. Although this set is all color, the B&W films are also very pleasant to watch.

This ""Shirley Temple Ultimate Collection"" contains 15 films. They are: 1., Heidi; 2., Curly Top; 3., Little Miss Broadway; 4., Baby Take A Bow; 5., Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm; 6., Bright Eyes; 7., Dimples; 8., The Little Colonel; 9., The Littlest Rebel; 10., Captain January; 11., Just Around The Corner; 12., Susannah of the Mounties; 13., The Blue Bird; 14., The Little Princess; 15., Stand Up and Cheer. If you get these films, in any other order or if some films are substituted for others, they are, most likely, bootlegs.",1360195200,6,1154,4.6292682926829265
8242239,5,B0011TM0Y8,"I bought this set through Amazon, from a company called CDUniverse.  I am completely happy with this company and this set.  It has all the classics; from  ""Baby Take a Bow"" to ""Since You Went Away""...it is aptly named:  Shirley Temple; The ""Ultimate""Collection.  I know if I want ANYTHING, all I need to do is go look on Amazon.  I will find what I'm looking for, every time!
Thank you Amazon and thank you CDUniverse!  Two fine companies, who brought this nicely priced, finely boxed collection to me!
Please spread the word...If you can't find something, and you haven't been to Amazon; don't waste another moment!  If Amazon does not have it...they work with someone who does!  :)
Sincerely,
Laurie Sydnor (a very happy and loyal Amazon customer!!!)",1347840000,,752,4.8125
