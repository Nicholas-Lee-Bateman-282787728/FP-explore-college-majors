8070763,5,B0009ZE9EE,"This is a great movie (but not for everyone).  Watch it with a grain of salt; the characters come right out of a Borat skit (the adults are all criminals, loafers, and whores) but remember that this was right after their independence.  Good acting all-around.",1509235200,,259,4.733333333333333

8070766,5,B0009ZE9EE,"This coming-of-age film from Kazakhstan follows the adventures of a possibly slow-witted teenager who gets involved with a kind of Fight Club, and when one of the fighters dies, the boy befriends the fighter's girlfriend and the man's young son. Performed with complete credibility by a nonprofessional actor who'd never appeared in a film before, the young man, nicknamed Schizo because of his apparent mental condition, observes, listens, and learns about life from the various adults he encounters. Meanwhile, he's never outwitted by any of them.

Life in Kazakhstan is not easy. Everyone scrapes by, makes do, sometimes sleeps rough, and trusts no one, yet the filmmakers find a way to make this world neither dreary nor despairing. Schizo clings to a kind of human decency, even while he loses his innocence, and while there's hardly a single good influence around him, he instinctively does the right thing. A disturbing but satisfying film.",1256688000,,947,5.189542483660131
8070767,5,B0009ZE9EE,"Surely, this movie is a tragic comedy of people left on their own in the ""middle of the bush"" where any making living crime is a good deed indeed.

However, this film is anyway very positively sexy, funny and entertaining to an extent mateship, black comedy, poverty, paedophilia and murdering could entertain cinema-goers.

Born and grown up in lawlessness of a post-Soviet ""democratic independent transitional"" era, an average Kazakh boy is used to a local grey environment of poverty and mirage of opportunities as illegal bidding and mafia rule are a very way of meeting ties. While bringing price money to a girlfriend of a killed boxer, this 15 year old established a special bond with a female acquainted, straightening upon a very short time into sexual relations.

Eventually realistically depicting a reality surrounding, the movie-makers finish this story about a Gorbatchev perestroika's child disturbed mentally for schooling and sane for serving a six year prison term on a positive tune as his much older fiancee and her grown-up son were greeting him outside a prison on his reliase, flowers in hands.",1180051200,3,1117,5.126373626373627
8070768,5,B0009ZE9EE,"Schizo. This appears to be the first major picture out of Kahzikstan and what an impressive, stunning debut of a film. Schizo is the story of a 15 year old boy everyone thinks is schizophrenic. He's kicked out of school for fighting, but instantly the viewer will recognize this young man as the sanest, most responsible person in the film. He's hired by his mother's boyfriend to recruit fighters for illegal bare-knuckle fights. Shortly into his new career, a young dying fighter asks the boy to bring his winnings to his girlfriend and his son. Immediately Schizo develops a sense of responsibility for this little family and does whatever he can to ensure their well being. Things turn nasty, but a pervading sense of hope seems to light Schizo's eyes and one never questions his judgment and he stays true to some code of honor that no one else seems to have in this tale.

It's a powerful, beautiful story with a sensational film debut from Oldzhas Nusupbayev. Throughout the film I kept wondering ""where did they FIND this kid?"" - and I was startled to learn he had never before acted, had no family and was actually growing up in an orphanage and discovered there. His performance is the lynchpin on which the entire film is hinged.

Writer/Director Guka Omarova's location scenes are visually strong, conveying a sort of resigned hopelessness and presenting a post-Soviet Kahzikstan landscape that feels like a world that had been stripmined for all its worth and then merely abandoned. Equally as impressive as this landscape are the wildly diverse and unforgettable faces of the multi-ethnic populations of this country.

Olga Landina plays the love interest and she is like a young, vibrant, Eastern bloc Rebecca Demornay.  Hot.

Schizo is a real find!",1150070400,16,1764,4.906040268456376
8070769,5,B0009ZE9EE,"SCHIZO is a stunning cinematic achievement from Kazakhstan courtesy of Gulshat Omarova who directed and co-wrote with Sergei Bodrov this story of survival in the bleak landscape of poverty in that part of the world about which we know little.

Mustafa (nicknamed Schizo by his schoolmates who find his behavior crazy) lives with mother and her boyfriend Sakura (Eduard Tabishev), a worldly guy who arranges illegal, brutal boxing matches with unemployed desperate men who are placed in a ring with 'professionals'.  Schizo's mother seeks help for Schizo from a kindly doctor (who she pays in eggs and sour cream of her own making): the doctor (Viktor Sukhorukov) prescribes pills for Schizo's behavior and headache and recommends expensive test in the nearby city.

Sakura engages Schizo to ferret out 'victims' for the illegal games, offering companionship and some money to the lonely kid.  At one fight a young man Ali is beaten to death and as he dies he makes Schizo promise to give his 'winning money' to his girl Zinka (Olga Landina) and his son.  Schizo keeps his word and delivers the money to Zinka who lives below the poverty level in a shack outside of the tiny town.  Schizo makes friends with Zinka's young son, and ultimately is forced to tell Zinka that Ali is dead.  Furious at first, Zinka gradually warms to Schizo as he repeatedly brings her little gifts he buys with the money from his work with Sakura.  The three finally form a semblance of family, a life Schizo has never known.

Sakura's dealings with the illegal boxing come to disaster when Schizo's alcoholic uncle, bribed to fight, actually wins, destroying the crime ring. Sakura convinces Schizo to rob a little store so that he can pay back the irate crime leaders, but as soon as the robbery is successful, Sakura denies Schizo his rightful 50%, tries to flee, but Schizo shoots the escaping Sakura, leaving Schizo now a killer but with all the stolen money as his own.  How Schizo deals with this mixture of misfortune and luck and the consequences of his behavior forms the ending to this little story.

The acting is extraordinary, especially on the part of novice Oldzhas Nusupbayev as Schizo, a young actor given little dialogue but who is able to tell legions of information with his eyes.  The camera work and musical scoring are as sensitively minimal and effective as is the story: the images of poverty and deserted structures left behind by the fall of the Soviet Union are mesmerizing.  Highly Recommended.  In Russian with English subtitles. Grady Harp, September 05",1126742400,18,2562,4.886836027713626
8070770,5,B0009ZE9EE,"Like many of my all-time-favorite moments in narrative cinema (Love Streams, Nobody Knows, Alice In The Cities, L'Argent), Guka Omarova's Schizo is not a mere ""list"" of characters, places, and events --- as all too many movies unfortunately are --- but rather a work of art that feels like an actual experience. There are enough striking faces and locations in this movie to rival Werner Herzog in his prime, and thankfully Omarova  used these components to create a smart, visually rich, and impeccably paced ""coming-of-age"" story that undoubtedly ranks among the most impressive debut features of recent years (despite being somewhat neglected by the critical establishment). Admittedly the film-to-video transfer on this edition of the DVD isn't quite Criterion-quality, but it is, however, fairly decent, and truth be told I enjoyed watching Schizo at home just as much as I did the two times I managed to see it in the theater. I highly recommend this film.",1125273600,9,962,5.127388535031847
