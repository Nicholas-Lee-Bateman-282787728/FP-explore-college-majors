Not many people here in the USA know about what happened in Holland, Amsterdam. I will spread the word about this movie to my friends.",1393718400,,278,4.264150943396227
8151675,5,B000JLQQ4Y,"Theo Van Gogh's movie about the murder of Pim Fortuyn is an absolute masterpiece.
It shows the real `sinister' interests behind this dramatic coup d'tat.
Pim Fortuyn would have won the next elections in the Netherlands and would probably have been the next Dutch Prime Minister in 2005.
With his more or less liberal, pro-market agenda, Pim Fortuyn was acceptable for the rightist political and economic powers and their media, until ... it appeared that he would not respect the Dutch NATO obligations (e.g., the purchase of brand new fighter planes), and would instead spend the huge sums available on more social programs. From that moment on, he became an outcast, an outlaw, free to be killed by any person who could be manipulated by the forces Pim Fortuyn had unleashed against him. He was shot dead under the eyes of the secret services.

One of his main media opponents was the socialist (?) TV commentator MVD. This man is the perfect example of the adage `do as I say, not as I do'. He defended passionately with his mouth the underdogs and the poor immigrants, while building a mansion of more than 2 million euros in his backyard. If anyone in the Netherlands had done the same, only one tenth of the actual Dutch population would have found a place to live there.

This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.",1248307200,3,1362,4.62396694214876

As time fades, fewer Americans remember the assassination of Pym Fortuyn during the Dutch election cycle of 2002. (Fortuyn is often described as a right-wing politician, but the facts that he was openly gay and that his concern was for the well-being of Dutch society seem to show the lie regarding his actual position on the political spectrum. Only if you make the assumption that his questioning of the Netherlands' very liberal immigration policy would rouse nationalist fervor against all Arab/Moslem immigrants can you call him right wing - he thought that more controls were needed to not give haven to Islamic terrorists.)

More of us remember the assassination of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh which occurred in broad daylight while this film was being prepared for distribution.  This DVD includes van Gogh's film about Fortuyn's murder, Theo's personal video diaries during the filming and post-production period, and a Dutch TV documentary one year later dealing with Theo's assassination and the lack of action by the police before, during, & after his murder.

Interestingly, the same ineptitude/possible complicity of the Dutch autorities can be seen in both the film and the documentary.  One even could wonder whether the assassinations of Fortuyn & van Gogh were orchestrated by the same group of politically connected persons in the police forces...

As a political junkie of an international stripe, I found this entire presentation captivating.",1193788800,9,1610,5.3438735177865615
8151677,4,B000JLQQ4Y,"The film was excellent and riveting up to the resolution, which was weak. I assumed someone else gave it a final edit after Van Gogh's murder, maybe not. In either the case, the end wasd too 60ish. But, overall, well worth the seeing.",1171843200,4,234,4.465116279069767
