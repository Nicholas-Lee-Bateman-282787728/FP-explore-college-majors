5169558,5,B008MCKLAM,I am really excited about this box set! Some people may think it is a little high in price but come on. You are getting 10 years worth of red vs blue action! Not to mention on blue ray with surround sound!,1349568000,13,205,3.9047619047619047
5169559,5,B008MCKLAM,"While people who have many of the Red vs. Blue DVDs may not be enticed into dropping money on the Blu-Ray version, for someone who doesn't have any of them yet, being able to get them all in one box set is a great opportunity.  The content is great regardless of what format you watch it in, but if you have the extra cash, you might as well get the best quality available for one of the best shows out there.",1349136000,59,409,4.049382716049383

5169561,2,B008MCKLAM,Two stars for pricing. $160? F that.  I'd be more willing to pay $100 considering you can pick up to season ten on DVD for almost as much. Retarded,1348185600,5,147,4.068965517241379
5169562,1,B008MCKLAM,The one star isn't for the show but for how it's presented in the DVD case. I love Red Vs Blue but the way this was packaged is absolutely awful. If you're not careful you can seriously damage the DVD case. I don't know what RoosterTeeth was thinking when they decided that this was okay but the way I see it? it is only good for those who want to sit this on their shelf and that's it. Don't think about opening this up multiple times or you're going to see wear and tear very quickly. The disc placement is awful too so be careful when you try taking it out to play the darn thing,1471305600,,582,4.025862068965517
5169563,5,B008MCKLAM,"I just finished watching all ten Seasons of Red Vs Blue and I gotta say I really love this series. starting off as just a comedy web show has since evolved into one of the most memorable series on the internet with a unique mixture of comedy, action and drama. A webseries with deep character development, exciting fight scenes and very funny quotes. Even the bonus features such as the PSAs are hilarious. A show that halo fans and Sci-fi fans in general will enjoy. It is simply a show with much time, attention, effort and detail put into it that will leave a lasting impression on you.
(P.S. Much like james rolfe's AVGN this show popularity inspired A bunch of RVB clones trying to cashin on the webseries success, but none living up to the bar that the people at Rooster Teeth have set.)(side note: I watched this on my PS3)",1470182400,3,830,4.467105263157895

The packaging could be better, it's bulky not as much as individual Blu Ray cases but it takes up a bit of space. Mine arrived without any moved disks or trays peeling away which is nice. I need to re familiarize myself with the series as my avid watching has dropped off as of late. The $64.99 price was a major force in my finally buying it, the 15th disk would have been a neat addition but the other bonus features will keep my time well occupied.",1459728000,,595,4.094017094017094
5169569,1,B008MCKLAM,Now I'm honestly not sure who to blame for this but when I received the set the box was all scratched up the disc were falling out the box.

Saw this on Amazon, along with the last 3 seasons on separate blu-rays and ordered them right off. Wonderful mindless entertainment. Other reviews that will cover it more, some strong language and of course wonderful mindless violence. While writing this review I noticed also Red vs. Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide, yeah, ordered that as well.  Just the thing to take the edge off the day.",1451779200,2,556,4.731958762886598

You get season 1-10.  PLUS you get a lot of nice bonus material! Will definitely keep any true fan entertained for years!!

The first couple seasons are not as HD, but you cant blame them for those being amongst the first of a up and coming lower budgeted show.

I was able to catch this in 2013 for $48 on a lightning deal and I would pay well over double that amount this show!! Brings back memories and a lot of fun times!! If you're iffy or wondering watch a couple episodes online and youll get hooked!!",1449878400,3,670,4.162790697674419

5169574,4,B008MCKLAM,"As there have been plenty of other reviews, I'll keep this brief. I just wanted to provide some clarification.
The seasons 6 and 7 trailers that are in fact prologues to their respective seasons, ARE in the set, though they're on the Blood Gulch Chronicles bonus disc.
The menus for the first 9 main seasons are different than the original DVDs, reminiscent of season 10. Disappointing, as they sometimes had easter eggs, but it helps tie the series together. The blu-ray menus are a bit slower than the original DVDs. I don't have the RvBX DVD set to compare them to.
There is an additional disc exclusive to RoosterTeeth.com and Best Buy, which contains the season 9 miniseries MIA and Where There's A Will There's a Wall that take place inside the Epsilon unit, as well as the live-action PSA also featured on the Halo: Forward Unto Dawn DVD. If you're an avid fan, this may be worth the extra money.

I didn't notice any other significant missing features besides a lack of trailers and of course menu easter eggs.

Discs 1-10: Their respective seasons
11: Blood Gulch Chronicles Bonus
12: Grifball Volume 1
13: Grifball Volume 2
14: Behind the Scenes
15 (RoosterTeeth and Best Buy exclusive as previously mentioned): MIA, Wall, Sleeper PSA

The packaging is a bit bothersome, folding all disc holders together. They're all made of what I assume will prove to be a brittle plastic, like many other multi-DVD packages. There's no slipcover, as I assumed there'd be, so it just kind of flops around if you have it open.

It's was still well worth the $120 I paid on RoosterTeeth.com when it was on sale.",1442275200,,1605,4.701067615658363
5169575,3,B008MCKLAM,"I've been a part of the RoosterTeeth community for nearly 10 years, and am celebrating my 10th anniversary with this box set.

Unfortunately, upon opening, I found some of the inner plastic cracked, and two discs loose, the plastic circular clips were broken and unable to hold them in place. Fortunately, they're undamaged.

I'm confident it wasn't caused by shipping, as the box, case, and two other Blu-rays in my order were in perfect condition.

So two stars off for atrocious packaging around what is otherwise a fantastic collection. Have a small CD booklet ready and waiting foot when this gets to the door.",1440720000,,615,4.894230769230769

5169578,4,B008MCKLAM,"It was a fantastic buy and I recommend it for any one who is a fan of RVB or RoosterTeeth themselves. The 8 hours of extra content after the 10 seasons was a great addition and made the buy worth it. However, if they combined the Grifball CD's and made it more console friendly, I would enjoy it even more. Other than that, 10/10. Greatest buy ever. Of all time.",1437609600,,362,4.185714285714286

I'm not going to spoil anything but if you're a fan and haven't seen up to season 8, your going to geek out. Even with its current $95 price, that's still less than $10 per season.

5169584,4,B008MCKLAM,"The show is awesome, although I've only seen up to season 5. The actual collection is okay, the box is pretty cheap and disappointing and one of the discs slots is broken. This included a bonus disc 15 which I thought was only available through the Rooster Teeth store which was a nice surprise and I placed the loose disc with that. The box has quite a bit of damage from storage and shipping, I think it would have been better if it had a stronger structure as it's very flimsy, I've considered buying separate cases for the seasons and creating my own photo shopped covers to make them look better. Regardless, the show is great and is region free, I am watching it on my UK PS4 and it works fine. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the terrible box, although maybe it was only caused by the shipping from the US to the UK which can't be helped. There is also a sticky plastic security tag thing on the inside, covering some of the art and will rip the card if removed. I don't know if this is how the boxset was produced or Amazon attached it but it doesn't look very good.",1434585600,,1083,4.186602870813397

5169586,5,B008MCKLAM,"I finally broke down and bought the 10 season box set. To be honest, I've wanted to for a long time. Delivery day comes and I finally get my hands on this long awaited box set. To be honest I was expecting more. The box that contains the discs is so thin and flimsy you almost expect to rip the box in half every time you open it up to get another disc out. Content wise, you can't beat it but you may want to purchase something else to keep the discs in cause I don't think the box will make it for long. For this that wonder why I gave it five stars....it's RvB....I don't care how crappy the packaging is, i love this show",1431129600,,625,3.9682539682539684

5169588,4,B008MCKLAM,I wish i could give this 5 stars cause its really deserving of it. I own the original dvds of RvB so i know how much the remastered this set. The only thing i could find wrong with it was during season 3 and Church was trying to stop Donut from killing Tex. He lines were cut out! There's no sound where he should be talking. All of the other background noise was going on but Church didn't speak....otherwise yes this is 5 stars. Loved the packaging and all the bonus features...OH THE BONUS FEATURES!! =D Was also a lil sad they couldn't keep the original opening to the dvds for the first 2 seasons but i got over that.,1429228800,,622,4.191666666666666

5169606,4,B008MCKLAM,"Love the high resolution, widescreen versions of this show. The only downsides that I can find is the case is really huge. It is as thick as about 5 or 6 blu-ray cases, and it opens up to be really wide. I was hoping it was gonna be seperated into a case similiar to the matrix collection with either the small slim cases or atleast in collections. Like the blood gulch chronicles in the one case, the re-collection in another case, and so on.

5169618,4,B008MCKLAM,"What makes this set so impressive is not that it has collected 10 seasons of the show into a very affordable package, but more the overhaul that was made to the first few seasons. Never has the word ""remastered"" been such a fitting term.

I had previously owned the original DVD releases for the season 1-5 (the Blood Gulch Chronicles). On these releases, half the scree was black and there was a targeting reticle in the middle of the feature the entire time. For those who are new to this series, simply put, this film was made using the original Halo game, and the only tools for capturing footage that was available, was the basic game and video recorders. The black half of the screen covered up the hands and weapon of the player who's video was being used for recording, but the targeting reticle was still present in every scene. Not only this, but it was also not in high definition.

With those few details in mind, imagine my surprise and delight upon starting up the first season in this collection to find a crisp and clear image (insofar as the orignal Halo can be clear and crisp) that stretched the full length of my TV, and no semi-visible targeting reticle in the middle of it. Blown away by it, is what I was; this was a very stark difference from the original.

To be clear, this series will not appeal to everyone. the humor can be very dry, and this is a very dialogue driven series. But as an old review said when it was first released ""It's Clerks meets Star Wars."" That's the best description of it, very clever and dry jokes, an original story, set up in the sci-fi world of Halo (but having nothing to do with the story of Halo itself). But for those who do watch consistently, the loyalty is rewarded later on with even better plot lines, and even better jokes (speaking from a perspective of one who enjoys the jokes).

This set is worth the purchase if you enjoyed the seasons, or even owned the original DVD releases. This is a double-dip that is worth the money.",1408924800,,1994,4.439890710382514

I can't even keep it on the shelf as the weight of the plastic and discs is pulling at the upper corners of the cardstock exterior, causing a tear at each upper corner, slowly allowing the plastic to fall out completely. Additionally, some discs are DVDs even though they are meant to be Blu-rays on this verified purchase (I confirmed it is an authentic copy) and the Blu-ray discs themselves are cheap, 25 GB discs (those are the ones Echo Bridge used). For the price, an incredible disappointment and not worth it over the DVD set or even just taping it off of a demand option, unless the price comes way down.

The series is great to watch online at Roosterteeth.com but at the same token I love having the behinds the scenes material, ease of watching on my TV without having to hitch up my PC, and really enjoyed the cinematic quality of watching the series discs like a movie versus the interruption of having to confirm and load the next video. From a materials standpoint, the item shipped timely, was as described, and I'm completely satisfied with it. Totally recommend this for the Halo and RvB fans - especially for the new fans to get caught up with the advent of season 12 starting.",1400544000,,645,4.521367521367521

This here is the complete collection and it comes with 10 seasons from 10 years blah blah blah, do you not know what this is? who are you, Gavin? Anyways, for all fellow RT members, it's a good deal. For all parents of kids that like RT or Halo, buy it for them and win 'cool parent of the year' and 'most improved with the computer' awards in their eyes! Warning though, it contains some naughty language; but if you are cool that doesn't matter because it isn't violence nor a commercialization of your child's thoughts with the attempt to turn them into little bastard idiot consumers. :-)",1397001600,,730,4.4148148148148145

5169641,5,B008MCKLAM,"Red vs Blue is hilarious, and I've watched it a few times. Watching all the seasons, without any deleted scenes and extras, is about 24hrs total, so I recommend doing this on a weekend when you're alone with no plans. The first couple of seasons are obviously poorer-quality than the others, since that's when they started off, but it gets better, especially when you get to the last 2 seasons.",1395014400,,394,4.642857142857143

5169643,5,B008MCKLAM,"The first half of this set is almost entirely comedy. The jokes are great, but be warned there is more than a bit of foul language, so it's not for kids. The first 5 seasons have a very loose story, but in season 6 the plot hits the fan! After that the story takes a much more driving role and it's at that point that you can't stop watching. It's still funny as all get out, but there are points that you have to pick your jaw up off the floor.

5169648,3,B008MCKLAM,"I am posting with a complaint/warning about the RvBX Blu-ray boxed set. I hope that it can serve as a warning to others and reach the appropriate person(s) at Rooster Teeth.

I purchased the RvBX Blu-ray boxed set on Amazon ([link=[...]]shown here in the Rooster Teeth store[/link]) and I'm very upset about a mistake that was made in authoring the discs: The set is missing pivotal pieces of season 6 and season 9: the trailer/prologues. (The trailer/prologue for season 7 is present, but hidden in the special videos as ""Episode 0."")

You see, I was one of the people who watched RvB when it was new. Then I lost touch with it (after the Blood Gulch Chronicles) until last year, when my girlfriend reintroduced me... and exposed me to the amazing reinvention that is ""Reconstruction."" From the moment I saw the trailer/prologue for Reconstruction, I knew that I was in for something special. Watching that trailer/prologue on my girlfriend's DVD was the moment that I got excited about Red vs. Blue again. So, when I bought RvBX for myself, that trailer/prologue was the first thing I tried to watch.

AND IT'S NOT THERE. Neither is the trailer/prologue for season 9.

I just missed the return window for Amazon too, so now I'm stuck with an expensive boxed set that's missing the thing that got me excited about it in the first place. It's a serious buzzkill... and a big mistake for Rooster Teeth in making the transition to Blu-ray. After all, those prologues are canon. If they were on the DVD's (and they WERE on the DVD's), they should be on the Blu-rays too.

P.S.  The packaging kind of sucks too (the discs are hard to remove) and the new Blu-ray menus are lifeless (compared to the fun, old DVD menus), but other than that, the set is fine.",1392422400,2,1752,4.6537216828478964
5169649,5,B008MCKLAM,Most have seen all of these episodes on Roosterteeth's websitr but the bonus footage that comes with this is amazing as well!

5169650,5,B008MCKLAM,Somehow the older videos are in 1080p quality and it was edited to be all smoothed together into one culmination of episodes. the editing is seamless and i loike what theyve done.,1392336000,,179,4.625

5169654,5,B008MCKLAM,"I've been a fan of RvB since episode 1, and had watched all 10 seasons prior to owning this. Still worth purchasing. The amount- and more importantly the QUALITY- of extra content made this like watching it all for the first time. At first I balked about how brief the two grifball discs were, but I realized they were probably maintained as they were originally shipped to preserve the delightful menu animations, a sort of extra feature of their own.

Could not be more satisfied with this product!",1391817600,,500,4.681818181818182

5169656,5,B008MCKLAM,"This is a fantastic series from Season 1 to season 10 included right here. I was planning on buying all of the seasons a long time ago, but I really don't have to anymore with this currently available. The first few seasons are the original-style of Red vs Blue but remastered to look much better and to remove the reticule from the Halo engine, and the last few seasons have a lot of cinematic and hand-animated scenes animated by Monty Oum, who is great at really-intense animation.

The story starts out quite simple which a few idiots in a boxed-in canyon in the middle of nowhere, and translates to a very deep and rich story about the Freelancer Project and how that ties directly in with the Halo multiplayer. The story in this is much better written than Halo 4. Quite honestly, I wished the Rooster Teeth guys wrote Halo 4's story as well.",1391126400,,848,4.5064935064935066
5169657,5,B008MCKLAM,"This, is the best box set ever....of all time.

5169659,5,B008MCKLAM,"My boyfriend and I have always loved Halo and have been watching the RVB series for a long time. I was a little hesitant about getting this box set for its original price (over $100) but I happen to be checking on it one day and it went on sale for around $60, which for a 14 disc box set it remarkable. Now that I actually have the set, I can see that it would have been well worth the original price. The quality is great and the reformatting is quite nice (the original dads we had were weird in that it was just a small box of picture in the middle of the screen). Yes, the first few seasons still don't look fantastic with the transfer to blu-ray, but people need to understand that just because you put something on blu-ray doesn't mean it will be automatic super high definition. All the stuff from Halo 1 still looks pretty good. Definitely a good buy.",1390521600,,860,4.218181818181818

I have 0 regrets and was reminded why this series is so great! It's amazing seeing how far they have come since season one. A must buy for any RVB/Roosterteeth fan.

Pros: Fantastic series cut together as one complete video for every season
  Hours of hilarious bonus features

Cons: First few seasons look/sound rough because they were filmed in the early 2000's with amateur equipment, but it can't be helped and doesn't detract too much from the show",1390003200,,587,4.561904761904762

In the past few years, I lost season 4 and my season 6 dvd was unable to play (due to my dog scratching it up). I was going re-watch the series until  I had remembered I was missing 2 seasons. So, naturally, on Amazon I went. I found this box set and it was around $80.00, and I wasn't going to spend that kind of money on it. It dropped to $55.00 a few months later, so I grabbed it.

The box itself is very cool to have. It is really neat, and any RvB fan would appreciate the box art inside and out, as well as the packet and 4 bonus discs.  When I opened up the box, I just stood there and admired the beauty of it for a while, and no...I'm not kidding. It is nice to have all my RvB (minus my Season 11) in one place, and in such a nice set like this. No regrets, and any RvB fan wouldn't have any either.",1387238400,,903,3.767195767195767

It's nice being able to watch whole seasons in one go without them being cut up into episodes.  I love all the commentaries, deleted scenes, and extra content.

My only problem was when it got dropped off at my door, the company Lazership, I believe broke some of the disk holding plastic inside for the last 4 DVDs, I don't understand how they were so careless and managed to do so.

If you are not at least familiar with the series, don't buy it.  Its a funny series but you should look it up before you pay for it.  Rooster Teeth Productions has a Youtube page where you can watch all the episodes.  Check it out and if you like it then buy it.

5169707,5,B008MCKLAM,The first five seasons were far more hilarious than a web-series michinima has a right to be. Fans of video games will love how the creators of RvB managed to make a fully functional comedy purely out of a video game. Made only more impressive that it was in the pre-forge/theatre days. The introduction of intense action CG in the later seasons is a fine augmentation to the more serious tone taken beginning in season 6. The action is very well choreographed and exciting. In conclusion I loved this series and it had me laughing all the way through.,1371772800,,552,4.585858585858586
5169708,3,B008MCKLAM,How all the episodes couldn't fit on 1 Blu-Ray is beyond comprehension.  But the show was still funny as hell and I don't begrudge them their money for all the laughs I have gotten through the years.,1371686400,,199,4.378378378378378

The story is well paced, the action in the seasons 8-10 are the highlights of the dvd but is still funny as all hell! Its enjoyable in its own right! Pick it up now if you're a fan of the RXB Series!!",1371600000,,408,4.243589743589744
5169710,5,B008MCKLAM,"I've watched the first 5 seasons of this box set so far and been very please with it.  I started watching RvB back in the middle of season 2.  I've previously purchased the first 5 seasons on DVD and comparing the two and web version, there are a few minor differences.  Some good examples:

Pros:

- Audio levels are...level.  HOLY COW!  I can't remember the amount of times I would need to grab my remote to turn up the audio for certain characters and during certain scenes and vice versa.  A perfect example is the very first episode of the series where Church and Tucker are sitting on a cliff spying on the reds.  Audio spikes in the previous online and DVD versions are horrible.  My speakers would crack/pop.  This time they finally fixed this problem, which is good becasue there is no excuse for it on a 10 season box set on Blu-ray.

Cons:

- Certain audio clips...were edit/adjusted/cut.  Ex: during a part in the show a sticky grenade is thrown by Donut onto the tank/Shiela while Tex is in it.  Church is attempting to shoot the grenade with a sniper rifle while cursing.  The cursing is cut out...which almost eliminates the point of having that scene at all.

Ultimately the RvB in this box set is what you've grown to love.  They've just done some editing.  Some for good and some not so good.  If you haven't seen the series this is a great set to pick up.  If you have and don't have this set, you should pick it up.  It's worth every penny.",1371600000,,1460,4.389513108614232
5169711,4,B008MCKLAM,"14 disc set, everything you ever wanted from the first ten seasons. Season 11 is being released now and likely quite some time away from a Blu-Ray release. First three seasons did not age well coming to HD, but were all shot on an original Xbox with component output to a video capture card with likely a 540p resolution, what do you expect? Reshooting the seasons in HD would destroy what they were, which was amazing for the time. This cardboard foldy thing with the discs two to a page one basically on top of the other so you have to remove an odd numbered season to extract the even numbered season below it, and feeling like it will fall apart in a few months? Bad decision, but not bad enough to me to trash the set on a review. Great set, would make a great gift for a fan. Bonuses on the last four discs are completely worth paying to have everything at once.",1371600000,20,868,4.266666666666667

I am disappointed that some of the discs included have about 30 minutes of material on them. The storage capacity of Blu Ray should have allowed this Box Set to be 4 discs shorter with the same amount of content.

After watching the first disc for 20 minutes, I thought this was just to add some sort of a pre-suspense for the actual movie to come,
So I fast forwarded till the end and it was a big ? (what).

I still cant understand what a few guys in red, orange, green and blue uniforms are doing on a terrible CGI (2D made to a 3D) clip are doing. Maybe I am a bit retarded to understand and the whole world must be sane. everyone is just chit chatting and firing terrible 2D weapons and wearing 2D armour which disappear into rocks (due to bad CGI) all done on something like a kindergarten software.

I have 2 knocks against this product, and the first knock against it is each season is played out like a movie with the chapters being at certain points throughout the playback. This is only a knock in the sense that you don't have the option to play the individual episodes. The second knock is that there are no subtitles, which can be frustrating, especially in the earlier seasons with the heavy voice filter.

5169748,2,B008MCKLAM,"This is a very personal review, I loved Red Versus Blue because it was so funny, the episodes they always depicted on Xbox live from little cut scenes you would get every now and then made it something I wanted to watch but never got around to.
Well what better time to purchase it than when it is 50% off and it all comes together?
Well I got it and to my surprise there was A LOT of cursing. The preview episodes I had watched never led me to believe there was as much as there is present in the video.
Not that funny, I am more for things that are actually ""funny"" because they are funny, not because they say a curse word and wait for the laugh.
I would say it is funny, but the funnies parts are through the natural acts of stupidity the actors portray, not in the unnecessary use of profanity, which in my personal opinion is like using natural human functions or ""potty"" humor or jokes about genitalia. Elementary humor at best.",1367452800,2,935,4.258426966292135

5169757,5,B008MCKLAM,"The Red vs. Blue series is a great action comedy for all ages, just like me, a fifth grader. This movie is based off of Halo and is related to other movies like Halo 4 Forward onto Dawn.  All seasons 1-10 include hilarious moments and characters like Caboose, Grif, Sarge, Church, Simmons, Donut, Tex, Washington, Carolina, and more. I would buy this suspenseful story and enjoy your time watching hours of great moments. The freelancer project tries to eliminate all forces of insurrection and bring peace to all people, but is interfered by the Reds and the Blues. In my opinion I like the blues better than the reds because they would do more funny stuff and more action packed things, while the reds would be goofing off doing funny and random stuff like trying to stop the world form having earthquakes by blowing the world up from the inside, and they would do weird stuff like building a tunnel bore out off an excavator to dig to the center of the world. I am also a great fan of the creator Rooster Teeth/ achievement hunter. So get ready to enjoy a great time. By the way the good guys would be the freelancer project and the reds\ blues. The bad guys would be the traitors of the UNSC (United Nations Space Command) also known also the insurrectionists.  If you love this series very much, you would also call this series the funniest web series in the last decade and maybe the next.

5169763,5,B008MCKLAM,All I have to say is that RvB is amazing and if you don't like it you are a cockbite.,1365552000,,85,3.3
5169764,4,B008MCKLAM,"I've been watching RvB religiously since I was eleven years old, when season 1 first went live. So when this ten year set came out, I was pumped to have all of my favorite content and memories on Blu Ray.

The visual quality is incredible. Thankfully, all the original audio is kept but each scene has been re-shot in high definition. The content itself is incredible and everything I wanted.

My only problem is that the packaging is surprisingly bad. The case is made into book form from thin paper material. This is very disappointing to me, seeing as the other Blu Ray sets I own have a nice heft and feel structurally sound (as far as disc cases go). This frustrates me because at $30, $45, and $90 for the Dark Knight, Ultimate Matrix, and Star Wars Blu Ray sets (respectively), each set has the previously mentioned heft and weight that comes with quality.

I know that Amazon has sales here and there for this item but the retail price at the Rooster Teeth store is $179.95 before shipping. A well-constructed case could have easily come for almost $200. I find that a cheap paper case for that price is unacceptable.

Overall, great item. You're buying for content so you won't be disappointed.",1365465600,2,1203,4.607476635514018

5169785,1,B008MCKLAM,"I bought the Blu Ray edition. If you're a fan, I would suggest you DO NOT buy this set. It's heavily edited. It does NOT contain the original 10 seasons. For example, all of the outros have been cut (the dialog over the closing credits of each episode) and episodes have been re-edited (scenes have been reordered, ostensibly so that they flow together without the breaks that, IMO, were an integral part of the original).

I prefer my old downloads from when I was a member to this box set. The least they could do is take the lies off the description. It's simply NOT the first 10 seasons.

For a concrete example see episode 82 from Rooster Teeth's web site (which you can watch for free). Here, the scene that starts at 2:53 was inserted back to 1:19.

For an example that seriously degrades the content see episode 83. This box set is missing more than 30 seconds off the end of this episode. Watch the episode. If you don't think the last 30 seconds are important, then go ahead and buy this box set. If you do (or if you're a collector), I would suggest you pass.",1358985600,35,1070,4.366834170854271

5169801,5,B008MCKLAM,"Hard to believe that RVB has been around for so long.

This boxset is awesome, and more than I ever thought I would want. If you watch RVB then you know what you're getting into - this has every season released so far, and they all look and sound better than ever in HD.

The extras are all fantastic, particularly the behind the scenes material, because the people at Rooster Teeth are all very funny and it's awesome to see how they work. The easter eggs, the PSAs, they're all great extras for those of us who want to relive memories of the series and they're easy to find for those who never got around to watching. I really can't find a single thing to complain about with this box set.

I grabbed this in a lightning deal before Christmas and it is definitely more than worth the money I paid. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all RVB fans. For newbies, the current asking price makes this a commitment, so I would recommend watching some of the web series first or maybe picking up a season DVD to check it out first and see if you like it.",1356739200,2,1047,4.277777777777778

I'm a sucker for extras, and these have lots of fun ones, from commentaries to outtakes, this set has it all, and you get to find out what happened to Georgia! If you're a hardcore RvB fan or you just getting into the series, I can't encourage you enough to pick up this set if you get the chance.",1356480000,2,579,4.225225225225225

5169812,5,B008MCKLAM,"Luckily I caught this on sale for about $50 here on Amazon so It was certainly a steal at that price. However even at the $130 full price it's still merely $13 per season, which you may as well price out as a movie due to the similar length in comparison to a TV show. The DVDs also include all the bonuses your heart could desire, from commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, out takes, and a bunch of other things that vary from DVD to DVD. Within those 10 seasons are also the mini-series.

All in all you get a great deal of content for even the full price. I find it beautifully done, even the Halo 1 footage looks excellent.

I would certainly buy again.",1356048000,,667,4.244094488188976
