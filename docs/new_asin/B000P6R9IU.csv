2811884,2,B000P6R9IU,"Thanks to Classic Media for publishing these additional episodes, but I wish they'd someday put some actual effort into a collection worthy of Underdog, his friends, and fans.

Pros: the DVD menu is exceptionally-well organized, allowing the user to watch whole shows, Underdog-only episodes, or the accompanying shorts, with each cartoon having its own chapter index. (Though there isn't a way to watch ALL the content, including the ""bonus"" episode, without interacting with the DVD.) The return of the ""cliffhanger"" format for the shows is a plus.

Cons: The ""bonus features"" are rehashed, the same as included on the Nemesis/Chronicles/Collectors DVD set; some of the cartoons don't appear to have been retouched much (digitally remastered?), having faded colors; MANY of the cartoons have audio issues, from distortion, to digital whistles or twitters.

I'm grateful for the content, but am very disappointed at yet another sub-standard Underdog video release. He deserves better.",1186790400,4,985,5.509933774834437
2811885,5,B000P6R9IU,"While I do share the frustration of you purists out there --- it would be ideal to have these classics uncut and complete --- I'm giving this DVD (and the others in the series) 5 stars.  Even with any cuts that may have been made, this DVD set still retains the charm and humor of my childhood hero.  I cant seem to find Underdog on any of the cartoon networks, merchandise & collectables are sadly too limited, and it's scary to think that the only exposure to Underdog for today's youngsters is the hella-lame Disney live-action movie.  I'd much rather settle for a few trims here & there with this DVD set than accept a pale imitation being the only canine crusader out there saving the world.",1186185600,2,696,4.464566929133858
2811886,2,B000P6R9IU,"Why can't they just release the complete seasons; full, intact, remastered like everyone else is doing.

I'll wait til it's done right.",1185580800,10,135,5.136363636363637
2811887,5,B000P6R9IU,"No need to fear! Underdog is here! Everyone's favorite caped canine superhero has once again flown into view . . . and the welcome mat (and doggie treats) is out. The three volume collection includes favorite episodes from the animated TV series . . . all together now (in your best Wally Cox voice):  Not bird, not plane, not even frog, it's just little old me, Underdog! And the timing couldn't be better: The DVD releases come on the paws of the big screen version starring the vocal talents of Jason Lee and Jim Belushi. Each volume includes six complete, digitally re-mastered episodes from the classic small-screen series. Mix this with shorts starring Hunter, Go Go Gophers, Klondike Kat, Tennessee Tuxedo, King and Odie, Tootie Turtle and Commander McBragg and you have one cool canine, even on the dog days of summer.",1185580800,,826,4.816901408450704
2811888,3,B000P6R9IU,"I have mixed feelings about these new Underdog DVDs (this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Underdog-Collection-Volume-1/dp/B000P6R9IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Underdog-Collection-Volume-2/dp/B000P6R9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Underdog Collection Volume 2</a>). On one hand, I think these cartoons are great for kids. Originally airing on 1960s television, the Underdog serials have just enough sarcasm (""Look! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a frog!) to engage even the most jaded child, and the show's additional cartoons include not just Tennessee Tuxedo, but the great Tooter Turtle and World of Commander McBragg. (Others include the King and Odie, Klondike Kat, Go Go Gophers and The Hunter.)

That said, whoever put together this set apparently has no appreciation for its contents. The shows on this disk are edited! Not for anything racy or racist (this was '60s television, after all) but just because someone is apparently too greedy, or too lazy, to deliver what they promise. Despite the fact that these were 30-minute television shows, on this disk each Underdog program runs only 19 minutes. Since half-hour shows back then typically had about five minutes of commercials, that's about six minutes short!

Worse, the cuts are done with the subtlety of a meat clever. For example, in the Tooter Turtle shorts, after Mr. Wizard says ""Drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome, time for this one to come home""... the cartoon ends! As another reviewer points out, that's NOT the end!

I gave this particular DVD three stars because of my fondness for Underdog, Tooter and Commander McBragg. But if you buy it, be prepared to be at least a little frustrated.",1185494400,19,1879,6.136882129277566
2811889,3,B000P6R9IU,"Just like the Space Ghost set I bought last week, these ""episodes"" are cut. They'veleft out most of the bridging material between the segments (such as the theme songs that used to play before the extra cartoons like Go-Go Gophers would start). This along with some time compression (Underdog sounds like Sweet Polly since his voice is sped up so fast!) on some segments and editing of other segments reduces the shows to around 19 minutes! What's the deal folks? I love this stuff, but can't any company find or create the complete episodes for any cartoon series??? Heck, I'd take the horrible 16-mm syndicated prints that used to show when I was a kid if I could get all of the material!",1185408000,,690,4.617886178861789

2811894,5,B000P6R9IU,"I am not normaly nostalgic although I do have very good memories of time past. But Underdog, simply put, brought me back to glorious Saturday mornings of my youth. It truly is something to see, even with the new eyes of age, one can honestly say; ""Never fear, Underdog is here"" to enjoy all over again.

2811898,5,B000P6R9IU,I bought this for my daughter as she was getting excited about the new Underdog movie about to be released. I thought it would be good to see how she would react to the old Underdog cartoons. She loved it! I also enjoy watching the old Underdog episodes.,1191456000,,254,4.3125
2811899,5,B000P6R9IU,My 4 & 8 year olds loved the entire series.  I bought it because they thought the new movie was really something NEW.  I told them how I remembered watching underdog on Saturday mornings and found this set to show them the REAL underdog.  They love the short cartoons between the on going saga of Under dog and Polly.  It also brought back great memories of good old fashion cartoons with out the anime and futuristic violence.,1189296000,,427,4.5064935064935066
