7855529,5,6303859887,"I heartily recommend this well-produced video for all young beginners and parents. For the 3 years that I've coached soccer ages 4-6, I have found this video to be helpful to both the kids and their parents. My own kids, ages 2, 5, & 6 have probably watched it 50 times and still enjoy it. You can't go wrong with this great value for the money.",1049241600,14,345,4.242424242424242
7855530,4,6303859887,This video gave my 3 year old son a lot of excitement about the game.  He used to only want to play for about five minutes and then lose interest.  Now we can hit the field and have fun imitating all the basic things of the game for 30+ minutes - not bad for his age.  He even wants to practice throw-ins!!!  The video works for what I bought it for - teaching the basics and stoking his interests.  The short run time is ideal before going out and playing.  I've played it for him more than ten times and he still loves it.  I got my money back on this easy.,999475200,17,559,3.9375

Gives a very general discussion of the objectives and rules in  soccer.  My 5 year old has watched it 4 times today (she likes  ""squishy"" the soccer ball).  It's fairly short, but gives kids  the requisite background to realize what's going on during the game. I  recommend it highly for new (young) kids to soccer.",969062400,27,461,5.04
