So when I'm just starting to enjoy the scenery, it jumps to something else. The other thing is the music. I don't dislike it, per se. It's inoffensive. But I'd have much preferred natural sounds. Water sounds. Or the option to switch between music and natural sounds, depending on my mood.  It's a good background nature DVD, and I'll keep watching it. But it could have been so much better!",1349395200,2,520,4.473684210526316
8379922,5,B002T6I5FU,"This is the most beautiful underwater video I have ever seen. Nature at its most lush, beatiful coral reefs and exotic fish make this a relaxation wonderland. I can tell you this was filmed in the natural habitat directly off the Hawaiian coast, it is absolutely gorgeous. This is not a documentary, no talking heads or narration to distract, just beautiful images and soothing music. WONDERFUL!",1285459200,5,395,5.0
