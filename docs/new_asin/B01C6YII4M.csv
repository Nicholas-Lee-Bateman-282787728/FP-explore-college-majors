7672837,1,B01C6YII4M,"One Punch Man is an amazing anime, but this is a pirated copy. If you want to help guarantee a second season, wait for the official release and make sure your money goes to the studio that made this.",1474070400,41,199,4.128205128205129
7672838,5,B01C6YII4M,"Poor Saitama has more power than he knows what to do with. The animation art style swaps up a bit depending on what's happening and it's a very effective technique for landing some pulse-pounding fights and some gut-busting jokes. The action is amazing and the jokes kill. I rank this alongside Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" as one of my favorite original superhero satires.",1471910400,,370,4.983870967741935

8752449,5,B01C6YII4M,"After doing research for the best price of the One Punch Man full anime ( excluding 1-6 of the new episodes that just came out, which haven't been released on DVD yet), I couldn't find a better offer than this one. Additionally, upon buying this, I also read many reviews on different One Punch Man full disk series DVD reviews that they were generally pirated. Yet, I made the purchase anyways because of the GREAT price and the GREAT reviews (emphasis on great because seriously, it's an exceptional deal with exceptional reviews).
While I haven't watched the DVD, since it will be a present to my significant other, I did recieve this package a whole MONTH before it was supposed to arrive.
I couldn't be more thrilled, excited, and genuinely happy with my purchase. These people really know great customer service and I'm so happy that I chose to buy the DVD through them.
I will update this review once my significant other and I watch this DVD.
Happy hunting and hope this review helps future buyers!",1480636800,,1006,4.6892655367231635
8752450,4,B01C6YII4M,Was not in english. I didn't see that in the discription. It just ended.... ?,1479772800,2,77,4.2
8752451,5,B01C6YII4M,I've kinda become obsessed with OPM.  His power is insane and he's got a IDGAF attitude.,1478390400,,88,4.5
8752452,5,B01C6YII4M,It's in Japanese so i have to use subtitles but its still hilarious,1478217600,,67,4.230769230769231
8752453,4,B01C6YII4M,"I think of One Punch Man as a Japanese take on The Tick, also operating on the premise that giving people superpowers doesn't make them better people.  It uses this for comedy and to make the instances of actual heroism feel more special.  The action is plentiful and awesome.  The comedy is fun.  And I love some of the characters.  It's a really good show.  But I do have some reservations.

First, the show fails on diversity.  Female, black, and gay characters are barely present and bad stereotypes.  Second, the Daisuki logo in the corner of every frame means I paid for a worse experience than Hulu.  Third, reviews talked about other Amazon listings of this DVD being Malaysian bootlegs that don't support the creators, and this version says made in Malaysia, so I have no idea if I even succeeded in supporting the creators. :(",1474934400,,836,4.664383561643835
