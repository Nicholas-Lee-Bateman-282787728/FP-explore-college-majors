431341,4,6302152461,This is a very good docudrama of the events leading up to the murder of Thelma Todd. What a senseless waste of a human life. Although her liking of bad boys was not a good thing. That was not a way to die. I enjoyed watching it till the bitter end.,1289520000,,248,3.8823529411764706

431343,3,6302152461,"White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd is basically faithful to the Andy Edmonds biography on which it is based, but ads fictional details such as private eye investigating the case and an imprisoned gangster who tells him some of the details of the case. Roland West is portrayed as quite a bit youg than he really was, and Pat di Cicco is portrayed as quite a bit older than he really was. Somehow, Zasu Pitts is left out of the story altogether, Patsy Kelly is here portrayed as being Thelma's screen partner all along ( actually Thelma Todd was first teamed with Zasu Pitts ) but Loni Anderson did a good job of portraying Thelma Todd and altogether it made and entertaining mystery movie for television.",1212624000,,717,4.609375
431344,3,6302152461,"This movie is a nice period piece set in the 1930's. The movie is based on an actual person. Thelma Todd was a real movie star of the time. The clothes,sets and overall feel of movie is right for the time. Once in a while an actor falls out of charcter, but mostly all the actors do a very nice job with this movie. The star Loni Anderson gives a good performance and is mostly believable as Thelma. She has a very good supporting cast. John O'Hurley plays the first and only husband and does a very nice job with his role.",1129420800,,523,4.137254901960785

7821842,5,6302152461,"Although it is half based in fact and half based on assumptions that can't be proven, it is an entertaining movie.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially for a TV biopic.  Loni Anderson is ... well, LONI ANDERSON.  She is toned down from the Jayne Mansfield Story and has some great lines in this movie, which she expertly delivers.  Her breasts get in the way most of the time but she was MEANT to play this role!",1522627200,,421,4.428571428571429
7821843,5,6302152461,White Hot was released in 1991. Loni Anderson stars in the film of Thelma Todd and who murdered her. Great ambience of old Hollywood. Great support from John O'Hurley and Marla Adams. Fans of Marla Adams will like this the most.,1519516800,,228,4.585365853658536

7821847,5,6302152461,"I can't stand Loni Anderson. As far as I'm concerned she is just another Hollywood wannabe and a gold digger. That being said, she was very lucky to get this role. Its a good look at the ever evolving Hollywood murder mysteries that continue to this day and beyond. The mob connection is an interesting bit of mob lure.",1434931200,,319,4.423728813559322
7821848,4,6302152461,"Great flick. Mystery, romance and humor. It's a sad story but worth watching because of the struggle, success and failure of Thelma Todd. Doing the right thing got her killed, but she was willing to take that chance. See it.........",1402358400,,232,4.825
7821849,4,6302152461,"Excellant portrayal by Loni Anderson - superb casting. Well scripted, & would appear to be very close to the actual events. The mystery of Thelma Todds murder would have been solved on todays investigation standard. A definite must see.",1353196800,,236,5.076923076923077
7821850,5,6302152461,"I only saw Thelma Todd in a few of her appearances - all comedies - but she absolutely blew me away with her beauty and vivaciousness.
She was definitely striking, and alluring, and, not knowing any better, made you feel as if you were witnessing a ""diamond in the rough,"" so to speak - as if her beauty and sex appeal passed unnoticed by everyone else.
But that is, strangely, a feeling you invariably get when you look at very early movies - you think that maybe they didn't know how good they were.
What we forget is that they had just as many problems and concerns with getting something produced as anybody does today.
The only difference is that we just see the finished product - as if it more or less just happened spontaneously, and we don't think a lot about how much effort it took to make it.
But it must have been a real shocker for her to have died in the way she did.
I don't know how it was ever resolved, if in fact it ever was.
Anyway, at least we got to see her in her glory years.

**  An update:

It appears that her former business partner and manager, Roland West, made a deathbed confession that he had killed her.
This was told to Chester Morris, an actor who played Boston Blackie, who didn't reveal it until his own death, on Sep. 11, 1970.",1332547200,,1267,4.2272727272727275
