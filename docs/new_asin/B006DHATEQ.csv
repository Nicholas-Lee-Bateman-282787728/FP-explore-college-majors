It's about a divorced couple, their two daughters,and their new love interests.  Of course everyone involved is deeply affected by the divorce. The father feeling abandoned by his daughters over his ex wives new boyfriend decides to along with his new girlfriend, kidnap the girls and start over some place else. His plan back fires and he finds himself on the run, finding new homes, and running from one job to another! His ex mean while hires a detective to help her. I'd recommend this movie for it shows just how deeply divorce effects everyone involved.",1343347200,2,674,4.524590163934426
