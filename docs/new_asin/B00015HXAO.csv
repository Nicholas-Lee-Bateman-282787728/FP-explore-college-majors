Shiloh became a ghost town after the silver mine shut down, strangers aren't welcome. Who is Tim Toomey? Natalie Brent says hello. She knows how to get out of a locked room.

The men ride to another location to wait for their boss. Tim arrives and goes with them to talk to the boss. They talk of an agreement. Professor Brent runs his machine while being kept prisoner. His daughter talks to him. Another airplane flies overhead. Tim is asked to meet the boss. A newspaper reports Tim Toomey Captured. The boss pulls a gun and disarms Tim. But Tim gets free. That machine is started to bring down another airplane. Tim arrives, there are gunshots. [How many bullets in a six-shooter?] The airplane lands, their passengers capture the villains. The skies are now safe for travel.

This is an example of a western set in modern times and using a scientific machine as part of its story. The hero stops the villains, any future romance is implied. Note how Tim is a government agent rather than an ordinary citizen. The snap shots with bent arms suggest blank cartridges.",1405555200,,1625,4.577319587628866

Very good looking print of what is considered one of the cult classics of B-Westerns, mixing elements of sci-fi, horror and shoot'em ups. This starts off like a Tailspin Tommy aviation movie with hero Tim McCoy (G-Man) flying over an area where aircraft have been reported missing, going down and crashing. He's to find out first-hand why? Sure enough Tim's plane gets the fits and Tim has to parachute to safety. It's because cowboy outlaws have kidnapped a scientist and are using his invention to carry out their evil scheme by bringing down aircraft transporting valuable bonds. We get lots of lab stuff here with crackling strobes of electric lights all buzzing and hissing in the true Frankenstein manner.

Time passes, but not too much. One of the outlaws (3 STOOGES foil Dick Curtis) goes into the big city to deal some bonds, gets shot and winds up in the hospital. The gang thinks he's dead. His assassin is caught by the G-Men, the bonds recovered and Tim McCoy then takes the assassin's place and tries to infiltrate the gang. During this period of the movie and henceforth Tim discards his aviation gear and dons his cowboy outfit as he picks up the kidnapped scientist's daughter (he's driving an 1880's buckboard and she's hitch-hiking) on his way to the ghost town. There's lots of neat interplay between the two as they ride along trying to check each other out. Tim's sidekick (he's hidden in the back of the buckboard) tries to show our hero a newspaper clipping about the missing scientist he's found amongst the heroine's luggage.

We arrive at the ghost town. Tim upstages the gang. Lots of secret panels and shifty goings-on. Wheeler Oakman is great, as usual, as the gang leader and the always outstanding Walter Miller is the big boss. Claudia Dell is fiesty and pretty. Things seem to be going Tim's way...until bad guy Dick Curtis is released from the hospital and shows up at the ghost town.

This is just great stuff! We get aviation thrills, a mad scientist lab in flashing splendor, a ghost town, cowboys and outlaws, an insane plot involving stolen bonds, and all played straight! If you're a fan of Autry's serial THE PHANTOM EMPIRE then this will be familiar territory. One word to describe it all: Whacky!

And pay no attention to ALPHA's dvd cover illustration. Tim DOES wear his famous BIG white cowboy hat in this film, not the little brown one on the dvd. It may not mean much to some, but it means a lot to me, as I always identify Tim with that BIG WHITE 50-GALLON HAT!!!

One of Tim McCoy's best B-Westerns. One of the best B-Westerns, period. A super nice print from ALPHA dvd...Go for it.",1335139200,,2668,4.665957446808511
8006875,2,B00015HXAO,"Despite its intriguing title, ""Ghost Patrol"" (1936) rides straight to dullsville. Released by Puritan Pictures, this ""B"" Western finds Tim McCoy in a wild plot centering on a death ray that brings down airplanes. Sounds exciting, but the action scenes are rather sparse and the sci-fi elements barely utilized. Stick with Gene Autry's ""The Phantom Empire.""",1329782400,,356,5.375
