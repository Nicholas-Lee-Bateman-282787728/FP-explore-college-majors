2963103,5,B000W79SEA,"The combination of actors and director make a great film. Bunel, Rey, and Deneuve keep you wondering how it's going to turn out. Surprise.",1374451200,2,138,4.791666666666667

A very fine Bunuel film.

I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to explore the subtleties of the ""war between the sexes"";the nature of power and seduction;and role reversal.",1373500800,4,310,5.4375

8221537,4,B000W79SEA,"Deneuve's performance is amazing, a transformation from innocent school girl to a femme fatale -- and ""fatale"" on crutches with one leg missing. Brilliant.

Brunel is always interesting, especially because he is so serious about the Freudian explanations of why people act the way they do. This may not be his greatest movie, but Deneuve makes it unforgettable. Her pacing while her seducer and the priests play cards, her seduction from a window of a naive gardener, the closing shot walking across a field -- wonderful.

8221540,4,B000W79SEA,"I liked this much better on 2nd viewing. The first time around it seemed obvious, heavy handed, and much less playfully interesting than Bunuels other work from the period (e.g. Belle De Jour, The Phantom of Liberty). I still like those films more, but on revisiting, I found this more wicked fun in what at first seemed like a pretty dour, almost straightforward revenge tale.

I will say that the fact that both leads are obviously dubbed was a bit distracting. Even in Bunuels surreal world I find that un-real in a bad way. But this tale of an innocent girl corrupted by a upper class gentleman who believes himself liberal and above the petty rules of society as an excuse for his selfish behavior -- and the way the worm turns -- has a lot to say about all of our hypocrisies. It just didn't quite transcend for me the way my favorite of Bunuels works do.

That said, a lot of our smartest critics count this as among his masterpieces, and as with any major film by a great film-maker you owe it to yourself to see it and make up your own mind.",1462147200,2,1050,4.3520408163265305
