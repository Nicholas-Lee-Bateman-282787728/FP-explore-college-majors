8560853,3,B00B1HHJSM,"Not bad in terms of exercise demonstration.  And it's very non-intimidating which is always good when it comes to being introduced to new equipment.  But the editing and the sound were both terrible.  It would just cut to the next exercise with no respect to the fact that you're stretching and massaging so you're moving slowly.  I was never ready and felt like I missed out on the instruction because of it.  It really got in the way of my understanding the sequence and the instructor's explanation of exercises.  The instructor's voice, which has a charming but unusual accent, was also muffled - so that was another obstacle.  I also found it frustrating that in the upper body, she started by specifying starting on the right side, but then didn't repeat the sequence on the left - or if she did, she never mentioned that the exercises were now on the left.  It was a kind of circular sequence that just didn't work without clear instruction (it also could have been the editing).  I rented it here to see it if I'd like to buy it.  I did it twice during the rental period.  It was my first experience with the foam roller.  I loved the roller, but not the video.  I do a lot of working out at home with videos, so I feel pretty confident in my review of the editing and clarity of instruction.  If it was an exercise technique I was more familiar with, I'd only give this two stars.  I don't have a lot of experience with the roller though, so I'm giving three stars instead of two to account for my lack of perspective.",1424908800,,1527,4.4035714285714285
8560854,5,B00B1HHJSM,This video is very easy to follow along with the exercises. The instructor goes slow and explains exactly what to do.,1421107200,2,117,4.619047619047619

8560856,5,B00B1HHJSM,"I kept hearing about the benefits of using a foam roller, but didn't understand how you were supposed to use it.  I purchased this DVD and it was PERFECT!  The instructor does a great job of telling you and showing you how to properly use the roller to stretch and massage your whole body.  Highly recommended.",1381363200,3,310,4.5
8560857,5,B00B1HHJSM,"I just purchased a Foam roller and really haven't used it that much.  this is a great DVD which takes you through all the muscles, one by one, nice and slowly, and she really knows what she's doing.  She offers many alternatives and suggestions, and demonstrates the moves so it's easy to understand.

It's a great full body massage - also some toning and firming, to balance with some of the positions of the roller.",1363132800,3,417,4.533333333333333
8560858,4,B00B1HHJSM,"PLEASE SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW:
I was purchasing a foam roller to do some of my physical therapy exercises at home after my total knee replacement therapy had completed.  I ran across all the DVD's for the roller exercises while looking for a foam roller.  After doing a little more research I decided to purchase a DVD to get more use from my roller. I chose this DVD for three reasons: 1.  Michaela Sirbu's other DVD's are highly rated, 2.  This was the most recently released DVD for foam roller exercise and 3.  The descriptions says, ""everyone at any level of fitness and flexability"".

I have now reviewed most every aspect of this DVD and have come to the following conclusion:  it is not for ""everyone"".  You must be able to get down on the floor and maneuver yourself onto a 6"" round roller and balance. I was able to do the first exercise with very  little difficulty and it made my back feel very relaxed. I was really enthused about this workout. However, as it progressed to the other exercises I found it difficult to balance and very frustrating.  So, I just watched several exercises and tried again when it came to the upper and lower back sections since that was what I was most interested in.  I was unable to do them at all.  Let me state that I have been doing physical therapy three days a week for three months, ride a recumbant exercise bike and do pilates.  So, I am not ""out of shape"".  I would never consider this something for a beginner or for ""everyone"".

The DVD itself was $17.99 and is very basic.  There is no background music.  It appears to be done on someone's patio with potted plants surrounding the instructor. At times the video seems to be pieced together.

The instructor does no introduction to the foam roller as to what thickness, what length, or what density.  There is no warm up section.  She speaks with an accent and was very hard for me to understand some of her words.  During the exercises she keeps her eyes closed quite a bit while she is talkingand I found this a bit unsettling.  I also thought she moved too fast when changing from one position to another.  By the time I got my body and the roller in correct postion she was already somewhere else. She appears to be making it up as she goes along and seems to search for words when referring to specific muscles.  In comparision to the almost 30 exercise DVD's I own this one appears amateurish.

I think some background music would have helped.  For $17.99 I would have thought something more visually appealing was in order.  (At one point you can see people walking behind her through the potted plants.)  I think that there should have been an introduction to the foam roller.

I believe positive results can be achieved by using the foam roller exercises. My biggest complaint on this particular DVD is that the description is very misleading because I do not believe this DVD is for ""everyone at any level of fitness and flexability.""  If you are familiar with the foam roller exercises and are at a high level of fitness and flexability this might be good for you.  I will return this DVD if I can and search for one that is geared for the beginner.

UPDATE:  Please take the time to read the comment to this review.  Apparently it is from the instructor.  She explained several aspects of the DVD as to the lack of music and selected location.  She also offers tips to better enjoy the DVD which I found worth trying.  She also suggests another DVD she has which is geared totally for beginners which I somehow overlooked when chosing a foam roller DVD.  Since she was nice enough to respond I am willing to give her suggestions a try for the next few weeks.",1360368000,20,3684,4.475975975975976
