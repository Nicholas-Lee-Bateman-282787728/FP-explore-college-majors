8627133,1,B00GSTHD3O,"I was very disappointed with this Did. First of all the cover should have been of a helicopter or a huge camera lens. This documentary is NOTHING about how wolf's hunt. It's rather about a wish they could capture a hunt on film, how ever that never happens. If I were to say actual animal action,  (hunting, grazing,  interacting,  wallowing in the ground) is 5% of the video,  I'm being very generous. I am not saying the crew didn't work their butts off, but then advertise this video as that. As simply a video about wanting to make a video that never happens. Would not recommend this video for the nature lovers. Would probably recommend it to some film students instead.",1442016000,,676,4.56198347107438

We just enjoy the shots of hippos or roaming elephants as we tie our robes and sip a tea in a temperature controlled abode.

In Killer Quest, we are taken along into the field to see how the crew gets the kill shot. From the planning, transportation, and elements, we are brought out of the comfort zone, visually, and placed into the field. Anyone who watches, and enjoys, nature shows should see Killer Quest. You will not watch another nature show in quite the same laissez fair way  thats for sure.

Here, the team, lead by cameraman Andrew Manske, head off to try and get footage of wolves hunting bison. The first place they air into is now under water. The animals have left the plain. Now, they must locate their roving subjects, and rethink the whole shoot  while Upper Canadian weather even allows for them to be able to be there; they are not lodged in a lodge by a roaring fire with cocoa here folks.

Once the herd and pack have been located , the crew must build a base far enough away from the creatures so as not to spook or cause any behavioral changes. That means a long trek to get out to where the beasties are each day, and a few camera people sleeping in raised covers among the animals for days.
In charge of getting Manske what he needs for any given assignment is Brian Bildon. He is a character and a half. Great at what he does. If it needs to be there for footage, he's on it. Complaining and whining, but, nothing stops this guy.

As you start to watch things finally come together, the group must also combat a bizzilion hungry mosquitoes and abide by the federal laws that protect the wild life. They are not hunting, but their helicopters (which get aerial shots of an animal hunt) can not fly after a certain hour, so as not to disturb the eco system. That's wonderful for the beasties, not so great for all who are ready to pounce with film in hand.

For anyone who adores wild life documentaries, Killer Quest will just strengthen your admiration. The work that goes into the footage is incredible. This documentary will give you an ides of the dedication involved.

The dvd has an added bonus feature of a doc on North America's Deadly Dozen; snakes and spider etc., that hang out all around Americans...it's fine, but not awesome like the feature doc.",1396915200,2,2451,4.467561521252796
