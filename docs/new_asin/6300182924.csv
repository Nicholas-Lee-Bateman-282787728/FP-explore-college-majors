223261,3,6300182924,"So so chase movie but Kirk Douglas and Lee Purcell are good.  Otherwise, It's like a television movie.  Just pleasant.",1353715200,,118,4.85
223262,5,6300182924,this is a great movie good acting and story line/ lot of adventure- the desperation of man on the run getting back to his family,1342828800,,128,4.16
223263,4,6300182924,"I am afraid most people would not give this movie 4 stars.  I, however, had to.  Mostly for sentimental value.  I have been a John Schnieder fan since I was a little girl in pig tails watching ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".  I first saw this movie when it was released in theaters.  In my mind it was always a wonderful movie.  Re-watching it I realized that I was way to young to know was a good movie was. Still, watching it again, more than 26 years after its release, I found I remembered and could anticipate most of the parts of the movie.  It made me feel like that little girl in the theater again.  And even now, I can't help but get a thrill from John Schnieder in that skimpy little wife beater (as cheesy as it is!).
The quality of the digital download from Amazon was not great, but was as good as can be expected from a ""B"" movie from 1983.  Over all, cheesy, not every well done movie...but it makes me happy all the same.",1291334400,4,930,4.150837988826815
223264,1,6300182924,"I ORDERED  THIS MOVIES ALONG WITH OTHER ITEMS, SADLY I NEVER RECEIVED THIS, . I EMAILED THE SELLER, BUT NEVER EVER EVER HEARD BACK, ,, I AM  HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING  ELSE I ORDER,",1290297600,,177,4.303030303030303
223265,5,6300182924,"I love all things JOHN SCHNEIDER from his very early days a Bo Duke to his stint on SMALLVILLE to all his CDs and beautiful voice. I never knew he was an action hero too! Kirk Douglas plays a villanous detective on the lines of ""Les Miserables"" wherein the detective is fixated on capturing Eddie Macon (John Schneider). Eddie has had a really bad set of circumstances starting with an inept lawyer having him plead guilty to charges that were unwarranted. Of course, this is not a lesson in criminal justice because there are many processes that the defendant would have to go through, but it is a story of one's man's courage in a world set against him. Everytime the detective gets close, Eddie manages to get away, but the charges keep adding up. Eddie is shown to be a person with a conscience as he does not want to take advantage of a divorcee who helps him escape. Eddie proves he loves his wife and son and won't succumb to the attempted seductions of his rich benefactor. Finally, Eddie is just ready to leave the US when the detective catches up again, and in an unselfish move, Eddie views a car crash that would possible kill the detective. Rather than leave the detective in the overturned vehicle, Eddie goes back to see if the detective is injured. The detective pulls out a gun and asks why Eddie came back - he could have left the detective and run to Mexico. Kirk Douglas has a turn of heart and tells Eddie to leave so that the capture will never occur. The next scene shows Eddie reunited with his wife and son in Mexico. The only problem I had with that ending was that Eddie will always be a wanted man in the US. It would have been better if his Texas benefactor hired a high-priced lawyer and had Eddie cleared of charges. But this was a movie of a man's battle against the system, not a course on criminal justice system! John Schneider looks really hot, has an excellent nude scene, and is in great shape!",1288915200,,1932,4.4145658263305325
223266,5,6300182924,"Thank you! Eddie Macons Run was a great movie and in like new condition, it arrived to me quickly and undamaged. Thank  you again.",1236470400,2,130,4.416666666666667
223267,4,6300182924,"The movie was the standard con(John Schneider) escapes and is pursued by relentless lawman(Kirk Douglas).

What made this movie special is the shower scene. Nuff said.",1127174400,6,167,5.423076923076923

223269,5,6300182924,"This movie proved that John Schneider wasn't about to stop with ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".  The ending is fairly predictable but it is still a  great action thriller for it's year.  I would definetly recommend watching  it!",966297600,7,220,4.864864864864865
223306,2,6300182924,It was okay... just not for kids under 15. Too much cursing for me,1472774400,,66,3.7857142857142856

223309,5,6300182924,The movie was just as good as I remember.  It arrived a few days earlier than I was told.  Which was great so I could watch it earlier than expected.,1440979200,,149,3.933333333333333
223310,5,6300182924,suspence all the way,1436745600,,20,4.25
223311,2,6300182924,I mainly watched this movie because I'm a big fan of The Dukes Of Hazzard & it had John Schneider but Kurt Douglas stole the show. He was great as the beyond determined cop trying to capture Eddie Macon & prove to himself that he isn't over the hill. Eddie Macon's Run is an OK movie & if nothing else it's worth watching just to see Kurt Douglas's performance. Now if I can only get the theme song out of my head....... Don't you know that I love you?,1432080000,,452,4.089887640449438
223312,5,6300182924,I've wanted to see this movie for a long time but I could never find it until I signed up on Amazon. I'm a big Dukes of Hazard fan and I've met John Schneider a few times so it's cool to see movies with him in it. It was a good good 80's movie. I'd definitely recommend it especially if you're a john Schneider or a Dukes fan.,1431648000,,326,3.8088235294117645

223372,5,6300182924,"Great movie; one of Kirk Douglas' last acting jobs B4 he became a sweet, senile ol' codger.  An attempt by Schneider, (aka. Bo Duke), to escape typecasting....but as a man on the run, right?!  Not much of an escape.  That said, it's a sweet movie, and a great one.  I live in Texas, and have since 1981.  What you will see is a pretty good representation of the way things were, and, sadly, still are in TEXAS.  Rent or buy it, you will enjoy it.",1390348800,,446,4.188235294117647
