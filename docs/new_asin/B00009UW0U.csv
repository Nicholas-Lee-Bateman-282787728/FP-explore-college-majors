1890305,5,B00009UW0U,"Thank You Lord!! The Xena box sets are coming out, a little faster each time. I know that the quality of this box set won't be outstanding, but hey, were going to get Xena in the original aspect ratio of widescreen towards Season Three!! Hopefully we can get some commentary and out takes with this Season's speacial features.",1058313600,2,326,4.637931034482759
1890306,5,B00009UW0U,"This season of Xena was a true masterpiece in every respect of the word. It was around this time that the show gained wild popularity as well as a good chunk of it's fanbase...and it's no wonder! These episodes were packed with the action adventure & eternally noble themes surrounding the deeds of Xena, a warrior who had forsaken her plundering days of evil conquest to passionately atone for her wrongs with the help of her loving and spirited soul mate, Gabrielle. The show is an emotion gem- an all encompassing tale of retribution and faith, selflessness and endurance, unconventional heroic defiance and the neverending cost of goodness and love. MY FAVORITES INCLUDED:
Remember Nothing
The Fates offer Xena the opportunity to erase her past but only if she vows to never shed blood in anger again. Gabrielle? Is that you?
Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
Xena is forced to take on the Bacchae-bloodthirsty minions of the wine god, Bacchus-in order foil his plan to take over the world.
Warrior...Princess...Tramp
Lucy Lawless takes on 3 times the duty as the Warrior Princess tries to protect a look-alike friend, Princess Diana, from the machinations of yet another Xena look-alike, a trollop named Meg.
Intimate Stranger
The duo's lives take a nightmarish turn when Callisto (beautiful Hudson Leick) escapes from the Underworld by infiltrating Xena's dreams and guilt.
Ten Little Warlords
While trapped in the body of her mortal enemy, Callisto, Xena is forced to enter a competition where warlords vie to become the new god of war.
A Necessary Evil
In order to stop the evil, and now immortal, Velasca from hunting down Gabrielle, Xena must unleash an even more depraved immortal to terminate her-Callisto.
The Price
Xena reverts to her old ways to whip a dispirited Athenian army into shape to take on a horrific foe known as the Horde but her ruthlessness absolutely sickens Gabrielle.
Lost Mariner
After a shipwreck, Gabrielle finds herself aboard the cursed vessel of the lost mariner Cecrops. Soon, she and Xena are confronted by pirates and the nasty sea god Poseidon.
A Day in the Life
Xena has 24 hours to prevent a warlord from plundering one village and the world's biggest giant from destroying another.
Blind Faith
A warrior wants to make his name by killing Xena. He fails but succeeds in putting the warrior princess in a blind (literally)rage when he kidnaps Gabrielle and sells her to agents of a king-who, it seems, needs a queen.",1025568000,,2451,4.9227053140096615

1890350,5,B00009UW0U,This season carries you on a lot of journeys and memories of the past and Xena's fighting skills. You see more of Gabriel steeping up to the plate to help fight off enemies. There are some scenes where Xena is not in them and they focus more on other characters. But for the most part the season is still good and there are enough scenes of good combat skills and good writing that you still are able to get into the season. For all the Xena lovers this is a good season and I enjoyed watching it.,1421193600,,497,4.134020618556701

Highly entertaining in an almost sensual way but without any sexual exploitation. Highly entertaining for the whole family and also educational to the younger set as to what is right and wrong in the world and about taking responsibilities for others who are less fortunate when they are being mistreated and/or exploited and treating any one who deserves it with great respect. Good quality at a great price. Thanks Amazon!,1411084800,2,567,4.68

Saddest part was opening the darned thing and no disks inside. :( At least nothing else was taken from my order. I hope the workers packaging everything take the time to inspect my replacement to make sure it didn't get ""absconded"" with in production/packaging.

At least they have good response time with sending out replacements. Here's hoping season 2 resend will have a happier ending.

1890405,5,B00009UW0U,"What a season! Normally shows lose their peak after their first season turns out to be a success. But for Xena, her second season adventures turned out better than I expected.

Visually the image quality of the DVD is sharper than in the first season, though it is still shot on a 16mm film stock and is a bit grainy. The CGI effects (matte paintings and 3d animation) are much better than in the first season. One of the few 3D animations I liked were the ones involving Poseidon whom I found impressive and staggering on a large screen. Now of course those visuals pale compared to what we can do today, especially in Spartacus. But for the short amount of time and other constraints the Xena crew had for their work, the Flat Earth studio produced some great CGI. Hope that they get to improve them as the seasons go on.

The location sets meanwhile are more gorgeous and diverse than in the first season. For instance, we now have some Xena episodes on the sea, which means great battles on large vessels, and other great battles shot on gorgeous New Zealand beaches.

As for the soundtrack, Jodeph LoduCa composed some excellent music. One of my favourite was the one between Xena and Solan at the end of the first episode, whihc really moved me, and the Joxer the Mighty song which Ted Raimi wrote the lyrics.

In its storylines, the season presented many episodes that either veered on comedy, or on drama, or mixed those two genres together to deliver very touching stories. Among my favourite episodes were the episode 1 (Solan and Xena's first episode, along with a very moving discussion at the end), episode 2 (A life with Xena's brother), episode 4 (Excellent Halloween episode, great use of the camera effects, and Gabrielle's scene at the dance), episode 6 (Meg, Joxer, and Xena with a Capital Z), episode 7 (scary intro filled with tense camera effects), episode 8 (excellent Hudson Leick and Kevin Smith, in an episode done while Lucy Lawless was recovering from a horrible accident), episode 10 (Great episode occuring in the 1940 that revealed what happened to the descendants of the main characters in our time period), episode 12 (Robert Tapert direction and Xena's struggles), episode 15 (felt like a documentary about Xena's day, lots of hand-held camera, and great direction by Michael Hurst), episode 16 (Joxer the Mighty in action), episode 19, (Xena's relationship with Ulysses), episode 20 (a side of Xena is revealed to Gabrielle), episode 21 (Xena and gabrielle help Cecrops the lost Mariner) and episode 22 (Very funny love stories!!!).

There were so many episodes that I loved during this season that I think this dvd set will be one I will love to rewatch over and over again. Though I have to point out that watching the Hercules series can be useful if you wonder how Callisto got stuck in that temple in the fourteenth episode.

See you next season!",1329782400,,2886,4.739043824701195

Of all the ones I saw, ""A Solstice Carol"" is my favorite.  I laughed myself silly the first time I saw it and I laugh just as hard every time since.  It is such a combination of holiday cliches that you just cannot help it.  Even the ""little"" tribute to Hercules brings a laugh (if you recognize him).

1890410,5,B00009UW0U,"Yet again we have Universal re-releasing the Xena series on their own(it was Anchor Bay last time)here in season two,but again there are NO extras at all-contrary to some previous reviews who seem to be reviewing the Anchor Bay issues;go figure!
In this season the cast,its great directors and its producers Tapert and Raimi,really hit their stride and take the show to a new and better level where it would remain until the last. They brilliantly combined drama,comedy and even pathos to produce some funny yet hard hitting stories,and as such remains one of my favourite seasons of all. If you want to see a prefect example of all three in action,watch the last ep A Comedy of Eros. The drama heats up as Draco(Jay D'Gaia,perfect in that role)plans to capture the Hestian virgins and turn them into slaves. On the comedy side we have Cupid's son(Cupid played wonderfully by Karl Urban,who would also play the juicy role of Caesar)running amok shooting love arrows into the unsuspecting. In the end we have pathos enter the ring with the unrequited love of a crying Joxer. Great stuff. This season sports some of my favourite eps like the comedy/drama A Day in the Life. On the intense side came The Price where Xena and Gabrielle have to fend off the Horde. The intensity and mood is set right from the first few frames of the film and never lets up throughout. There would be few eps of this intensity until the India trilogy later in the series.
This season also sees the return of Callisto(played to perfection by Hudson Leick) and we are introduced to the Goddess of Love herself Aphrodite played by the beautiful Alexandra Tydings in her wonderful Valley girl affectation. Another of my faves is the ep The Lost Mariner which finds one of my favourite actors Tony Todd playing the damned Cecrops. Mr Todd in any role I have ever seen him play in comes to the plate with an intensity and seriousness that few other actors can muster. I don't know why his this totally underrated actor isn't more well known. Of course Kevin Smith as Ares is back;could there ever have been a better person in such a role? I do not think so.
All 22 eps are included in this season and as I said with NO extras. However the sound and picture have improved with season two. The sound is in Dolby 2(as with season one)but it seems much better in separation. The picture is now up to the quality it should be. As I noted in my first season review,that season seems to have been shot for the most part in 16mm because of so much grain in evidence. This season you find it clearer and crisper,as one would expect. And THAT,is a good thing.
All in all I give this season/series a two thumbs up. Everything seems to gel together and the show is off and running and doesn't stop until the end ep. It is one of the best(some would say THE best)seasons the series ever produced. No matter where your personal feelings lay,you will enjoy the proceedings here immensely. Top talent all around,not to mention the consistently high caliber of stunt work,gives us a ride that would never be repeated. Highly recommended.
Addendum:The releases of this series by Universal seem to be getting slower and slower. I hope they do not go the way of the Leave it to Beaver series. With that one,after just two seasons,they decided to let Shout Factory have the honours of finishing off the entire series. Time will tell.",1303257600,4,3384,4.604304635761589

1890418,4,B00009UW0U,"The year '95 marked the second season of the wildly success 'Xena: Warrior Princess'. There were undoubtedly numerous reasons for the rapidly growing cult following associated with this television series. It was a dark, mythic journey populated with the ancient Gods and Goddesses of Greece, a fast paced action adventure, a ""jiggle show"" for the high testosterone crowd, a girl power advocate and a cutting edge gender statement which constituted a surprising large portion of its admiring, devoted fan base. Add to the mix a newly introduced tongue and cheek aspect to the always clever story lines and you had a little something for everybody!

One of the big pluses for me in season two was the expanded use of Xena's foil Callisto played to absolute perfection by Hudson Leick. I enjoyed how they pulled a rather ingenious body switch between the two arch-rivals to cover up for the brief absence of Lucy Lawless. While Lucy was and will always be the personification of the fictitious Xena, it was rather intriguing to watch how Hudson Leick interpreted the role.

My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-.",1227052800,2,1096,4.951086956521739

These DVD's were released after 2000 so there should have been no reason why there was no CC or subtitles. Movies and TV shows from earlier than 2000 and when CC was not common are able to have these options and with the large fan base it's a shame that these were left out. 5 stars for shows and 0 stars for no CC.",1225584000,3,535,4.009345794392523
1890420,5,B00009UW0U,"I believe that the local TV stations where I live owe me an apology. For years I heard about Xena. Who didn't? But every ad I saw for the show portrayed it as a mindless ""juggle"" show and thus I had no interest in watching it. As much as I might admire the female form, it does not induce me to watch a show ONLY about that.

Then one day I found the last episode of the series on DVD and, priced at $1.99, how could I resist finding out what all the fuss was about. Well, what I watched on that DVD was no ""jiggle"" show. I was blown away and picked up Season Two to see if the rest of the show could live up to the finale.

I was not disappointed.

Xena: Warrior Princess is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. Period. It's a show all about fun. Pick any episode from this incredible season and let yourself be entertained. It's clear the creators of the show wanted each episode, regardless of plot, to be fun. Oh sure, it's campy, over the top and about as historically accurate as Meet The Spartans. But they just throw everything, including the kitchen sink, into every episode. And when I say fun, I don't mean mindless fun. The shows are well-written, well-acted and they mix comedy, action, history, myth, drama and characterization deftly. The final result cannot be classified as any one of these elements. But the mix makes for great entertainment.

Although a little light on the special features, this season does have some good commentaries both audio and video and there's a nice behind the scenes featurette with interviews from cast and crew.

I thoroughly enjoyed this season and have since picked up ALL the others. Xena is truly a unique viewing experience. I highly recommend it. And, TV station, I'm awaiting my apology for forcing me to wait this long to see it. But that's the beauty of DVD. Xena is a winner!",1217548800,8,1838,4.410029498525073
1890421,5,B00009UW0U,Unbelievable season I just love Season two. The action never seems to stop. I remember watching this season when Xena first aired on Fox. Counting down the days till the next show. This season has so many Great Episodes in it. If you a fan of the Series or just becoming one. You've gotta watch this Season.,1202774400,,307,4.4035087719298245
1890422,5,B00009UW0U,"This series had everything in it: Comedy, drama, inspiration, musicals, etc... I also believe this was a series that helped create certain television shows and movies. Watch (Here She Comes... Miss Amphipolis 1997) and tell me that's not similar to (Miss. Congeniality 2000). Remember that Xena was being played in a different time period (Historical Times) and Miss. Congeniality is being played in the present, yet they are still similar. The show not only had a few good laughs with the help of Joxer (Ted Rami)but also allows viewer the feeling of Catharsis. Seeing Xena battle her past demons and realizing she wouldn't be the hero she is without her past is PRICELESS. Also watching the growth of  Xena (Lucy Lawless) and Gabrielle's (Renee O Conner) friendship is something very special. They become family and travel to the exotic lands of Asia and to the beautiful landscape of Egypt etc...

The DVDS are worth it I own all 6 seasons and the commentaries are GREAT. I especially love watching Hudson Leick's (Callisto)commentary she's intelligent, funny, and beautiful.

P.S. My one note would be buy the director's cut of The Final Episode (A Friend In Need) because it's much better. Plus you get great extras including commentary by Lucy, Renee, and Rob and you also get behind the scene footage including a little B-Day cake for Lucy. The commentary is great I just finished watching it again for my 100th time because I find Lucy and Renee hysterical.

I will always have faith that a Xena Movie will be made, although Gabrielle lost faith in her Hope; I will always have faith that Xena will eventually become a movie; plus I'm only 19 so I still have plenty of years left to wait lol.

Well Thank you Lucy, Renee, Rob, Hudson, Ted, Bruce, Kevin and all the other people that made Xena possible. You filled many homes with joy, laughter, and inspiration; it truly is one of televisions greatest moments!",1200787200,2,1918,4.817629179331307
1890423,4,B00009UW0U,"Many shows improve dramatically in their second season, but XENA was so different as to be almost a different show.  It isn't hard to locate precisely why XENA was so much better in its second season.  Season One of XENA saw the show treating each of its action plots with complete seriousness.  It completely lacked ironical distance from its plotlines.  The stories in both Season One and Season Two were absurd, but while in Season One the show acted as if it imagined they weren't, while Season Two proceeded with a frank acknowledge of how much of the show was ridiculous.  In other words, in Season Two XENA in part became a comedy.  In large part this was helped by the discovery that Lucy Lawless was a good comic actress.

There were other reasons for the improvement in Season Two.  The overall writing improved markedly.  Though still not a big budget show, they clearly had a larger operating budget in Season Two.  Most striking was the addition, despite the preponderance of comic episodes, of several very dark and surprisingly effect serious episodes.  Although the show had trouble ""selling"" the serious episodes in the debut season, several in Season Two were very compelling.

Another change in Season Two was the increasingly moving relationship between Xena and Gabrielle.  XENA started off as a female buddy picture, but as fans identified (or perhaps more accurately, created) a lesbian subtext the show did more and more to feed the fans.  XENA was, in fact, one of the first shows to respond in a strong way to the way that fans were responding to the show.  Although both Xena and Gabrielle are portrayed throughout the series as heterosexual, the show from Season Two until the end of the series continued to foster the idea that the relationship between Xena and Gabrielle was deeper and more profound than any that either would have with any man.

Nonetheless, the show both in Season Two and until the end of the series, managed to be alienating to many viewers.  I've never enjoyed Asian martial arts films because of the extraordinary reliance on wirework.  I even find such masters of filmmaking as Yimou Zhang difficult to appreciate because of the physical impossibility of the things the characters do.  So for me the outrageous jumps and leaps that Xena routinely makes serve to distance me and alienate me from the overall story.  BUFFY would very occasionally use wirework, but only rarely.  XENA is addicted to it.  To the show's credit, it intentionally made many of these elements sillier and sillier, as if conceding that it is all in fun.  Xena's use of her chakram gets increasingly impossible.  In one scene she is waiting for the arrival of a giant in a village and, bored, she tries to pass time by bouncing her chakram off several surfaces.  It is all done so routinely that it reminded me of Steve McQueen bouncing his baseball off the wall in the prison camp in THE GREAT ESCAPE.

The second source of continuing alienation is the continued abuse and misuse of history.  There is a scene in BABE: PIG IN THE CITY in which Babe looks out over the skyline of the city and sees the Eifel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, and several other famous structures adorning the city.  It is absurd in the same way that the world of Xena is.  Basically every famous person from the ancient period from the Homeric Age to the late Roman Empire is alive.  Xena meets and romances both Ulysses and Julius Caesar.  Goliath turns out to be a good friend and Gabrielle nurses a crush on David.  For perspective, I found it difficult to enjoy the series ROME because of historical liberties.  But ROME strives to be historically respectable; XENA uses historical and mythological figures any way that it wishes.

The bad news is that XENA would persist in its defiance of both physics and history.  The good news is that the stories would continue to improve.  Its third season would represent an improvement over the first two.  In fact, it is only in Season Three that the central story of the series actually begins.",1184803200,,4072,4.7411095305832145

- Video: MUCH better than the grainy 16mm film transfer of Season One.
- Audio: Dolby Digital throughout (a big step up from the Dolby Stereo of Season Two).
- DVD Extras: Good-quality stills, plus audio and video commentary on three episodes.  Season One included zip - nada - bupkus.  MUCH better!

The audio commentaries are the usual option, easily available through the menu for each of the three episodes.  The video commentaries are a subset (about 40% in each case) of the audio commentaries, with images of the commentators sitting in front of a wide-screen TV watching the episodes.  The same set (except for number of chairs) is used in all three video commentaries.
X:WP Season Two contains performances by the following recurring characters from the Hercules/Xena world:
 - Ted Raimi as Joxer, bumbling would-be warrior
 - Hudson Leick as Callisto, nemesis extraordinaire
 - Kevin Smith as Ares, God of War
 - Robert Trebor as Salmoneus, mercurial merchant
 - Bruce Campbell as Autolycus, King of Thieves
 - Danielle Cormack as Ephiny, Amazon warrior
 - Michael Hurst as Iolaus (Hercules' sidekick)
 - Tim Thomerson as Meleager the Mighty
 - Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite, Goddess of Love
 - Karl Urban as both Julius Caesar and Cupid (son of Aphrodite) ) (should actually be ""Eros""; ""Cupid"" is his Roman name)
 - Jay Laga'aia as Draco
More notable one-shot guest stars from Season Two included:
 - Lisa Zane as Miss Skiros
 - Mindy Clarke as Velasca
 - Rachel Blakely as Penelope
 - Tony Todd as Cecrops

1890437,4,B00009UW0U,"I love Xena Warrior Princess and Hercules Legendary Journeys, and season 2 is Xena at her best. Destiny is one of the five best episodes of Xena ever; it reveals what made Xena into the Warrior Princess rather than just another petty warlord, and it has that great Gaelic song. I didn't pay much attention to Remember Nothing when it aired on television, but after watching it twice on dvd, I've realized how important it is to the series. However, the quality of the dvd did not match the quality of the show. It's very grainy; actually, it's the poorest quality of any dvd I've ever seen.",1077062400,3,590,4.5233644859813085
1890438,5,B00009UW0U,"A unique mix of action, drama, and humor, of fantasy, history and myth, made X:WP a unique show.  All these qualities are on display in Xena's Season 2, probably the show's second best next to S3.  Highlights include outstanding drama such as THE RETURN OF CALLISTO, DESTINY, A NECESSARY EVIL and THE PRICE, and sparkling comedy such as the unforgettable A DAY IN THE LIFE, TEN LITTLE WARLORDS and A COMEDY OF EROS (which combines madcap comedy with genuine poignant pathos at the end).  Other terrific eps: REMEMBER NOTHING, INTIMATE STRANGER, THE QUEST, BLIND FAITH, LOST MARINER.  Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor really come into their own in this season.  The supporting cast shines too: Hudson Leick does a superb job not only as Callisto but as Xena in the body switch episodes, INTIMATE STRANGER and TEN LITTLE WARLORDS. The late lamented Kevin Smith shows two very different sides of Ares, God of War -- the cruel arrogant god and the suddenly human mortal.  Ted Raimi as Joxer raises his character above mere comic relief, giving him true nobility and poignancy.  There's also Karl Urban in dual roles as Caesar and Cupid, Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite, and a notable guest appearance by Tony Todd in LOST MARINER.
I found the picture and sound quality to be excellent.  There could have been more in the way of commentary and bonus footage (no outtakes here, for instance), but still this is a great buy for any Xena fan.",1074556800,6,1432,4.7926829268292686

1890440,5,B00009UW0U,"This is a must have for the fans who can't see the show anymore.  I loved seeing the audio/video on some of the episodes.  I can't see the show on regular TV anymore and I'm too far away to go to the convention each year, so this helps with my Xena fix.",1068422400,,253,3.8461538461538463
1890441,5,B00009UW0U,"First off let me say I have had none of the technical problems that some of the other reviewers had and it would be a shame if someone who is a fan didn't buy this set because of it. (Yes, the picture quality could be better but it is still far and away better than the VHS version)
When I saw this was being released on my birthday I took it as a good sign... and boy, was it. I forgot how much I loved this season; so many great episodes. ""A day in the Life"", Callisto"", ""The Price"", ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" and many more. The best part of this DVD set for me was the commentaries... like the one for ""Callisto"" done by LL and ROC. They both don't like to watch their own work when its finished, so when they see their interaction after Gabrielle's wedding it was just priceless to hear them ""get"" what the ""subtext"" fervor was all about. All the commentaries were enjoyable.
Lastly, the 1/2 hour commentary by RT, LL and ROC was neat not only for their respective insights but the MUSIC! I really love Joe LaDuca's stuff for this series and was extremely disapointed when the dance music from ""Girls Just wanna Have Fun"" didn't make it to the sound track (Or M'lila singing about her homeland on ""Destiny"")but, iti is in the commentary...
I recieved 3 sets for my b-day and concidered keeping them all! ...hope this was helpful...Peej",1068249600,6,1341,4.368

1890443,5,B00009UW0U,"...about Anchor Bay's latest offering of Season Two.  It was alot better than the first season in terms of picture quality and offerings.  But if anyone working for Anchor Bay is reading what I have to say, please note that we WANT MORE! :)
First off, try to clean up and sharpen up the DVD and it's code foundations so that my brand new UNIX-based 17-in widescreen PowerBook Mac doesn't suffer from any more from the occasional freezeups of both season's DVDs.  Second, have LL and ROC along with other various castmemebers do full-length A/V commentaries of every episode in all subsequent seasons.  Third, try to get out a seperate two to four DVD set of Xena WP Outtakes and Commentaries.  And fourth, try to package all future sets using the same packaging for the first season set instead of the second season set.
Of course, I would have also mentioned number five but that would be a little hard for anyone to try to fufill.  And that is to have a DVD of Salemoneus attemping to use both season sets for 1. forgiveness from Talmadeus for a previous bad deal, 2. a get-out-of-jail pass by Lord Xerxes, and 3. runner-up prizes for the contestants from Messini, Parnassus, and Skiros. :)

1890446,1,B00009UW0U,"This time I wasn't too stupid for wasting my money on the second series. I double checked every description to see if it had closed captioning or subtitles and I didn't find anything. Although I can hear like most normal people with my hearing aids, I am hearing impaired and still miss out on things, so I rely heavily on CC or subtitles. Almost any other DVD I have ever bought automatically came with these features and yet I ended up making a bad purchase when I bought the first Xena series only to find there were none. Technology has come a long ways in filling in the void for Hearing Impaired and deaf people and yet Anchor Bay is still way behind.
I have been a dedicated fan of the Xena series and was very happy that the TV series had CC. The final episode that came out on DVD also had CC. So why did Anchor Bay choose to ignore this feature on the full season series? Anchor Bay could be making so much more money had they been more considerate. As I had stated in my previous review for the season one series, I absolutely refuse to purchase any more series without those features.",1064534400,13,1096,4.299516908212561

1890450,4,B00009UW0U,"The season two set is much better than the first. The actors' commentary is what I was hoping for. The last (7th) disc is much like the season one compainion disc for the pc, and is basically useless for ""hard-core"" Xena fans, everything on it can be found on the web. So why do they keep putting it into the dvd sets? Here's hoping that ""the powers that be"" will realise that they are not going to recruit new fans with these expensive DVD sets, and that they will start catering to those of us who have been here since the begining; with more behind the scenes clips, a full season of actor commentaries (there are only three episodes in this set), and more indepth info about what the ""studio"" wouldn't let them do. Overall, I am very happy with this season two set, and hope that season three will only get better.",1063152000,5,818,4.352941176470588
1890451,5,B00009UW0U,"I forgot how much I loved this season!  I purchased Season 1 on DVD for a hundred bucks when it came out.  I was expecting this to be the same but it was so much cheaper!  The quality is much better and wow!  I spent all day reliving my favorite memories from season 2!  It's such a beautiful, diverse season!  There is a lot of emotional conflict with Xena and Gabrielle.  Especially in The Execution when Gabrielle is trying to save a friend's life while Xena thinks he's gulity.  Then you get to The Price when Gabrielle finally sees how Xena is in war.  She starts to see pieces of Xena's past.  But she lives through it and stays by her side.  This is a remarkable season which helps solidify the bond between Xena and Gabrielle!",1062806400,6,734,4.323529411764706
1890452,5,B00009UW0U,"This set is a major improvement over the 1st set. This one has audio and video commentary by LL, ROC, and Rob Tapert. The video commentary actually shows the stars talking about the episodes they are reviewing. It's very MST3K-like (but in a good way). Very funny stuff. They do tend to cut some of the episode during the video commentary, though (not too much, but minor scenes are missing). The 7th disc is for your PC and has mostly the same stuff as the 1st season's extra disc. It was a very good season and i think this DVD set does it justice.",1062806400,,550,4.298076923076923
1890453,5,B00009UW0U,"Season Two of Xena is one of my favorites. The first season was a little 'bleh' as it was busy getting it's feat wet. Season Two was well worth the wait. The actual quality of the dvd set is much better than the first one. Even though the first group of episodes in S2 were still shot in 16mm, the season two set does a better job of cleaning up the film grain. The coolest thing about this set besides the episodes, is the audio and video commentary tracks with Lucy Lawless(Xena), Renee O'Connor(Gabrielle) and Rob Tapert(writer,producer,director). Lucy and Renee are just too funny as they tend to go the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 route and just make fun of themeselves. The Rob Tapert commentary is a little frustrating,as the guy only talks about how he wishes he could have done this better and that different (The same problem with the FIN dvd). He doesn't seem to be very happy with his eps, oh well, I like em.  My favorite things in S2 are Hudson Leick(Callisto)'s brilliant performance as Xena's arch nemesis. Renee(Gabrielle)'s growth as an actress (The Quest) and introduction of the comedy episodes (Warrior...Princess...Tramp, A Day In The Life).",1062633600,16,1164,4.791044776119403
1890454,4,B00009UW0U,"Like most of the above reviewers, I too thoroughly enjoyed Season Two's episodes.  The introductory scene in ""The Return of Callisto"" may be the best six minutes of female ""kick butt"" ever seen on television; I was surprised by its violence when I first saw it...and still am.  ""Charlie's Angels...,"" and ""Laura Croft...,"" to say nothing of Jennifer Garner's character in ""Alias,"" have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on Hudson Leick as Callisto in this episode.  When she is BAD, she is REALLY BAD!!
Still, the Xena series DVDs have a ways to go to match the sound and picture quality of other TV series.  For example, the ""La Femme Nikita"" Year 1, recently purchased, is far superior in terms of both color rendition and sound, particularly in color(blues and reds)and stereo separation and bass reproduction.  As a Xena fan since the first year, I'm still waiting for the DVD quality to match the quality of the acting, scenery and storylines.
Of note, I purchased the final Xena episode DVD more than a year ago, and its quality is top drawer, so I don't think it has to do with any of the series production values.
Regardless, the Warrior Princess truly rocks!...and I'm still buying Year 2 (again), but hoping for better quality in years 3-6.
Update as of 03 Sep 03.  Had the oportunity to watch four episodes and the interview with Tapert, Lawless and O'Conner on the new (02 Sep) Anchor Bay release.  Agree with tgsbch's comments regarding audio and video quality and thinness of the DVDs themselves.
I would add that while the interviews contained nothing particularly ""new"" if you are a long time fan of XWP and have the numrous books that have been written about the series, the audio and video commentary options on two particular episodes, ""A Day in the Life,"" and ""Return of Callisto,"" are particularly rewarding.
Each option is edited differently.  With the ""audio"" commentary you see the entire episode, with Lucy and Renee commenting (voiced over) on particular scenes.  With the ""video"" commentary selected, you see a significantly edited episode, cutting to visuals of Lucy and Renee sitting in director's chairs (along with Tapert in ""A Day..."") and commenting.  Lots of interesting observations by all three, including discussion of the lesbian subtext issue, ""comedic"" versus ""violent"" episodes, (Lucy prefers the former, Renee the latter--it's clear she's the athlete of this pair!),the skills of particular directors, cameramen and stunt personnel, the real skill of Hudson Leick (Callisto)with a sword, Leick's adlibbing some of her dialogue to create the memorable character of Callisto (Lucy notes that to have a really good hero requires a villan that is REALLY bad, and Leick's Callisto fit the bill!),Gabby's change in clothes, bust, weight, etc. throughout the years.  Lots of comments and discussion transcend just Year Two and reflect on all six years of the series.  I found these two episodes, particularly with ""video"" commentary selected, to be particularly interesting, and worth purchasing the Anchor Bay edition even if you had already purchased the previous Year 2 issue.",1059350400,27,3099,5.078740157480315
