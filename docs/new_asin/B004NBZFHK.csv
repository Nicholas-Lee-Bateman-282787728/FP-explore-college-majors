4992162,3,B004NBZFHK,There's nothing like watching period newsreels to get a feel for a time period.  The public domain Universal Newsreel collection is a great source of information and stock footage.  Just don't expect clean stock footage from this particular collection.  The compression needed to get 15 hours on 4 DVD's replaces the organic old-film look with a modern digital over-compressed look.  Some segments appear to have come from a previous VHS source and have visible tracking artifacts.,1264809600,10,481,5.2894736842105265

4992182,4,B004NBZFHK,"Hee Haw: The Collectors Edition is a 14-disc DVD box set of selected comedy sketches, appearances by Country & Western stars, and musical performances from the show, which premiered on TV in the late 1960s and was known for its one-liners, sometimes corny, other times sharp and incisive. Co-hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark, on June 15, 1969, introduced a national audience to the shows fictional setting of Kornfield Kounty, a place populated by hardworking farmers, barbers, banjo players, husbands, and housewives. Hee Haw was canceled after a two-year run on CBS but was picked up in syndication and aired until 1992, making it the longest-running weekly syndicated original series in television history.

The box set collects over 21 hours of the best sketches and stars from the series 23-year run, seldom seen since their original broadcasts. Included are the korny klassics PFFT! You Were Gone, Gordies General Store, Board Fence, Cornfield, and Moonshiners, along with favorites Rinercella and Trigonometry.

Also included are classic performances from Hall of Famers at the peaks of their careers, including Tammy Wynette (Stand By Your Man), George Jones (White Lightnin), Merle Haggard (Okie From Muskogee), Waylon Jennings (Me and Bobby McGee), Johnny Cash (I Walk the Line), Jerry Lee Lewis (Whole Lot of Shakin Goin On), Tanya Tucker (Delta Dawn), and Loretta Lynn & Conway Twitty (Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man).

Bonus features include new interviews with show regulars Roy Clark, Lulu Roman, George Lindsey, Charlie McCoy, and Jim and John Hager; and comedy skits from the early years in Hee Haw Laffs, featuring Doctor Spot, Old Philosopher, Haystack, and Schoolhouse.",1472601600,4,1689,5.342105263157895
4992183,5,B004NBZFHK,"This is a great collection of good old country music of previously released episodes at an incredibly high price, considering years ago, I found most of these discs at my local Sears warehouse for $2.50 each .Music rights don't come cheap these days.

4992191,5,B004NBZFHK,"5 Stars Plus!
  In my humble opinion to view  Rene fully dressed or undressed she is one cool chic!
  Could watch her without her being in a porno  movie and still get excited.

  Why am I hooked on rene? --------- See my review for  Necromania.

4992192,5,B004NBZFHK,"i'm a fan of ""Golden Age"" porn from the 70's and 80's.  ms. Bond was one of the best.  Full of schlocky-kinky fun; and extremely good looking.  She actually made sex fun not sleezy.  Some of the movies didn't star Rene; in fact, in one or two she is in the early scenes but then you don't see her anymore.  (maybe she went out for coffeef)  But all in all she is in, as advertised on the marquee, most all the films. And she doesn' t disappoint.  Sexy, cutsie, well put together physically and her naive acting manner is more than titilating.  wish she made more films. She never made it in the big-time like Seka or Havens but her B-movies are pleasing.",1400976000,4,654,4.260162601626016

8498976,5,B004NBZFHK,"I have wanted this show for a very long time. I know that they are on a cable channel, but for the longest time I could not get it ( RFD).

This show is just plain fun to watch and I remember as a young child getting to watch this at my grandma's house every weekend. If you like clean laughs and some cute chicks to look at, this has that covered.

This would be great for some older folks to go down memory lane, and the young might find this funny.

The music brings back many memories of days gone by, but not forgotten. There is a boat load of old country music, and yes I am a fan of Roy Clark. Grandpa Jones has what is for supper, Minnie Pearl has her tags on her hat, the old dog just plays around, and the fence hits them in the back side, and then you find out the population of an area.

This is money well spent, and the time you take to watch is time well worth it. I wish that this was around a few years sooner, then I could have sat with my grandma and watched it with her again.

Grab some munchies and sit down and enjoy this with the phone turned off, and let the laughs begin.",1519430400,2,1097,3.901345291479821

I remember him laughing while we watched this show on television many years ago and though I am 52, I felt like the little boy of years ago watching him laugh at these again.  Such great memories back then and more memories now knowing he is enjoying these.  Hee Haw ... so much clean fun you just don't get on TV anymore.  This show reminds me of when times were much more simple and fun.",1510444800,2,447,4.162790697674419
