5087508,5,B007I1Q4KO,"Virtually nothing with which to find fault.... EXCELLENT picture, WONDERFUL scenery, good narration (although not the best), DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 channel sound, no wasted time watching scientists tinker on their computers or set up their tents, etc.
No disappointments! Apparently it's not a strong seller, but it deserves to be.",1358467200,17,332,5.529411764705882
5087509,5,B007I1Q4KO,have only watched about half of this DVD but so for this is GREAT enjoy learing about aminals that  I did not even existed.,1357603200,3,123,4.125
5087510,5,B007I1Q4KO,"The first episode Mountain really show off some great footage of wolves, mountain cats, bears etc. and the cruelty side of life where the strong and the fittest survive (and that is only on the first episode itself !). As for audio quality, it's one of the best that I heard so far for documentaries. A recommended buy if you are into this type of genre.",1355875200,15,354,4.378787878787879
5087511,5,B007I1Q4KO,"Since Planet Earth was released on blu-ray years ago I have collected nature documentaries.  I was surprised to come across this and not have heard anything about it and promptly purchased it, despite the concern of no reviews.  For anyone contemplating purchasing this series I strongly recommend you do so.  The photography is incredibly breathtaking throughout.  Josh Brolin is adequate as a narrator, though nothing special for those who are accustomed to David Attenborough.  The score is just decent, but with imagery as amazing as what is on display in this series it does not matter.  Untamed Americas is an incredibly well-produced series that should be appreciated by anyone who has the slightest interest in nature.",1344988800,38,726,5.2155172413793105

5087554,5,B007I1Q4KO,"Almost as good (production) as the BBC documentaries. Still a great watch and excellent value. Not a lot of repeated footage borrowed from previous shows. David Attenborough is the only this it's missing...but he can't be everywhere, all the time. (Can he?)",1432771200,2,257,5.142857142857143

5087575,5,B007I1Q4KO,"I bought this as a gift for my stepdad and mom, who travel the U.S. a lot by RV.  The photography and shots are AMAZING on this Blu-ray, and a group of 5 of us couldn't help from commenting throughout the series.  Without doing much reading ahead, I thought it was a feature, but it looks like a series in 5 parts with bonus features.  I highly recommend this for anyone interested in nature, and especially specific to the Americas.  Our son is just turned 8 and could handle the predator scenes just fine.",1388620800,,507,4.361702127659575
5087576,4,B007I1Q4KO,Loved this DVD. Gave as a Christmas gift and it has been played twice already...! A must for people who love wildlife DVD'S,1387929600,,123,4.391304347826087
5087577,5,B007I1Q4KO,"the photography is breath taking, at times through out the dvd you have to stop and ask yourself how or who did they film it. Truly Amazing",1385251200,,139,4.185185185185185
5087578,5,B007I1Q4KO,Entertaining Blu-ray disks  of the North and South American wildlife  !  The quality of the blue-ray  disks are excellent .,1378684800,3,123,5.0
5087579,4,B007I1Q4KO,"I bought this while looking for movies about horses (handling, riding, wild, etc.), and since that category was lacking I picked this up and 'Planet Earth' to get some wildlife viewing in, knowing full well the 1st lady really wants horsies (but this would have to tide her over). It did the job, but when we watched 'Planet Earth' we were much more impressed with that over Untamed Americas.

Pros:
LOTS of great footage of various terrain and eco-zones on Earth. Plenty of wildlife watching to do, and beautiful scenery.

Cons:
Some borrowed (or sourced?) footage from(to) 'Planet Earth' DVD set.

Overall I liked it and will watch it again. On those long winter nights when the 1st lady and I want to go out but it's too rainy/dark/dismal/cold etc., we can watch nature unfold from our log-fire warmed living room.",1376524800,7,817,4.780141843971631
5087580,3,B007I1Q4KO,"With stunning cinematography, this product should be must have. However, we cannot find a format that the first disc will play in. The second disk is very enjoyable; that is the only reason this product has a rating. If both discs played, this would be a 5 all day long.",1373846400,2,270,4.42
5087581,5,B007I1Q4KO,"Got this especially for Grand Kids, but we love it too! The pictures were wonderful and action of animals in the wild were great.",1370390400,,129,4.416666666666667
