8239999,1,B001139ZJM,"I ordered this Blu-ray and it wouldn't load on PS3...  The PS3 is updating constantly, so I doubt it is a firmware issue...  Exchanged for another one and it also did not load...",1343174400,,178,4.363636363636363
8240000,1,B001139ZJM,"This video was clearly filmed at a public aquarium during regular hours of operation.  Frequently, viewers can readily see tourists' reflections in the tank glass, or tourists looking through windows on the other side of the tank. Annoying and distracting.

At the very least the video should have filmed this after hours, or an HD underwater camera put in the tank. I've seen the HD underwater photography in ""Planet Earth"" and ""Galapagos"" and it's stunning.",1212969600,5,459,5.1066666666666665
8240001,2,B001139ZJM,"I wasn't impressed.  I expected somthing similar to the cover, but that is not what you get.  A few of the chapters are ok but nothing spectacular.  Most of the chapters are of rather ugly boring dark fish filmed in front of a artificial background, and the fluttering light from the filter pump above is somtimes distracting.  I wanted a HD DVD to showcase my HD tv with, but this is not it.",1207526400,16,392,4.328767123287672
