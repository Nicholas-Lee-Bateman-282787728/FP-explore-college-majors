8442261,4,B004UUJZ7A,"I seem to have the same reaction to each of Angelopoulos' films; flawed genius. But in each film, what feels flawed and what feels masterful is different.

Mild spoilers ahead...

In this story of a 12 year old girl and her younger brother on a fruitless journey for their non- existent father in Germany what works is the ultimate emotional impact of the piece (it left me in tears), and (as always) the sheer poetic power of some of Angelopoulos' images.

On the other hand, a key supporting character (the youthful actor Oresteis) is thinly written and exists basically as an overly-convenient plot point. Some of the dialogue and ideas feel heavy handed, and some images are lifted from other director's films. And the references to his own earlier film 'The Traveling Players' are an interesting, brave style choice, but also a bit distracting and intellectual. The young girl's acting is mostly terrific, but the young boy feels fake at times, which doesn't help.

There are scenes I'll never forget. Maybe the most disturbing (yet completely hidden) rape scene I've ever seen. But other scenes feel awkward or forced.

This is the kind of film that may grow on revisiting, and I certainly plan to see it again.

If possible, get your hands on this now out-of-print 'New Star' DVD. The transfer was overseen by the director, and it blows away the New Yorker DVD.",1438992000,,1368,4.8
