200767,5,1596982004,Excellent...fabulous!!  Worth the money and the time... I learned alot about history of the past 26 years and fell in love with the courage and love of Venerable John Paul II... He was/ is a living saint.,1302566400,16,204,4.513513513513513
200768,5,1596982004,This is an amazing and inspiring story of courage and deep faith in Christ.  Pope St. John Paul II was a true prophet for our times; his intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit is palpable during his speech to the crowds in Poland.,1301788800,,234,4.441860465116279
200769,5,1596982004,"I bought this direct online as Amazon doesn't seem to carry it right now. This video is wonderful. So much footage I haven't seen before, and very insightful and meaningful interviews. I just returned from a trip to Poland that changed my life. One of my memory cards from my DSLR failed and over 400 images were lost. This DVD has brought back almost all the places I visited on private tour back to me. That is superficial.

I have watched this video a few times now and every time I tear up at some point. The power and majesty of the Pope. The hard-working, devout Polish people. The sincere love for their country. Freedom prevailing. Everyone should watch this video, it's very well produced.",1282262400,48,698,4.584
200770,5,1596982004,Just saw this terrific DVD this morning. Catholics and those of goodwill will find this story moving and enlightening.,1277164800,48,118,5.2631578947368425
200771,5,1596982004,I love this movie!  As Newt Gingrich is famous for being able to do; he brings together the pieces of history into a condensed story.  It gives me chills to see how God works in awesome ways.  Also Callista's choice on the music is inspiring in outlining the defining moments.  They are a great team bringing together important moments in history for us to understand in the world spectrum.,1414022400,,390,4.608695652173913

200773,5,1596982004,Great insight of the magnificence of our Saint PJP - great overview of how persistance and strategy can overcome the mightest of powers. Wish we had such leadership and synergy now,1406592000,,180,4.838709677419355
200774,1,1596982004,Definitely recommend it and will buy some for friends and relatives for birthdays and Christmas.  It was historically accurate and Newt Gingrich and wife did a great job producing it.,1401321600,,183,5.1
200775,5,1596982004,"The headline is the words of Jerzy Kluger, John Paul's friend from childhood, at the end of this documentary. He said he knew of none like Karol Wojtyla.  Reflecting on leaders of countries he observed in his lifetime he said: ""No one did better than our beloved Lolek.""

This film is inspiring. I pray it may inspire viewers to take a lesson from John Paul and the heroic people of Poland and change the culture of the USA. WE ARE NOT WHO THEY SAY WE ARE! We are created in the image of God and we deserve dignity.
Once religious freedom goes, we go neo-communist.",1398988800,,565,4.371428571428571
200776,5,1596982004,"Loved it! Learned so much about what was going on at that time in history and what it all meant to all of us, especially the Poles.",1396051200,,131,3.888888888888889
200777,5,1596982004,"Excellent, informative dvd telling of the life of this amazing Pope with facts that most people never knew.

200779,5,1596982004,This film has extraordinary footage.  It was quite captivating and gave a real historical thumbprint on Poland's freedom from communism.,1367020800,,136,5.8
200780,5,1596982004,"this is a truly compelling, amazing documentary of a man who changed the world. you must watch this if you haven't... I have Jewish friends, other non-Catholic, Christian even atheist friends who loved this.",1355788800,,207,5.117647058823529
200781,5,1596982004,"I've always admired Pope John Paul II, so I love anything that I read about him.  Being of Polish heritage, I remember how thrilled my parents and Poles throughout the world were to have one of their own elevated to the highest position in the Catholic church.  This book provided information I was unaware of, so it was a learning experience as well as a reading pleasure for me.  While the Pope was disliked by some, he was loved and admired by so many more who looked up to him as their leader.  What a strong, courageous, and humble man he was.  May Pope John Paul II rest in eternal peace.",1354147200,,594,4.315315315315315
200782,5,1596982004,"I bought this DVD, then I bought a copy for my Mother.  It is a profound movie...the best movie I've ever seen.  That sounds extreme but I have been researching what happened in Poland for almost a decade. I have been shocked how little we, as Polish Americans, know about the history of the land our grandparents came from.  This movie tells a big part of the recent history: of how Poland was enslaved to be a communist country (even after fighting incredibly hard with the Allies in WWII) and how the communists tried to eliminate God from the most Catholic nation of Europe.  But the power of the movie is its message:  be not afraid--to confront those who would take God out of your lives and those who take away your freedoms.  It is a must see for all Polish Americans and all Americans who want to learn more about how Poland, inspired by a Polish Pope, changed the world.  Buy and watch this movie!",1350432000,,907,4.427710843373494
200783,5,1596982004,"I loved this film-- loved it, LOVED IT.  Pope John Paul II was able to remind millions of Polish people that the source of their freedom is God, even under the most oppressive government.  I loved the interviews from people who were there, who heard the pope speak, and who saw how an entire nation went from having their heads down to pride in culture and optimism that Truth will bring about freedom. The footage of the crowds of MILLIONS was amazing.  Oh to have been part of those gatherings.

It sent chills up my spine this summer when the Democrat party took God out of their platform at the convention and then, in a very bizzare vote, put the name of God back in.  Why would Americans want to do to themselves what the Soviet Union did to Poland?  We need to learn the lessons of Poland's history and never allow this to happen to us.

Thank you Gingrich productions for this amazing film.",1347494400,9,898,4.406060606060606
200784,5,1596982004,"This movie deepened my appreciation of the freedoms we take for granted in this country. The struggles of the Polish people under an atheistic government should be a warning to us to never be complacent about our freedom.
I miss Pope John Paul II and wish there were more truly great leaders in the world today.",1342137600,7,311,4.571428571428571
200785,5,1596982004,EVERYONE should see this documentary...WOW....you will love it and your family should own it....what a great timeless piece and what a beautiful thing to have in your home to watch!!,1341532800,,182,5.1
200786,5,1596982004,"I shows what can happen when pressure is to brought to bear where needed.  It is a shame that it took so long to defeat a government which is at the bottom of the cesspool.  Corruption shown at it finest.  Magnificent example of how the Pope and Church works to right wrongs.  Nothing changes overnight, but with the correct people at the right time anything is possible.  Great film.",1328918400,2,384,4.507246376811594
200787,5,1596982004,One of the best films ever made on Karol Wojtyla. A film that will send shivers down your spine. A film that truly inspires. A true masterpiece. If you have not seen this film I highly recommend that you see it!,1327449600,,211,4.170731707317073
200788,5,1596982004,"I stumbled upon this film at a Chicago Polish festival over Labor day weekend. If you are of Polish descent or have any interest in history, this is a a must see film. It's a very well done, educational and inspirational piece of film making that will stay with you long after the movie is over.",1315180800,4,295,4.285714285714286
200789,5,1596982004,"An intense recounting of the true but little known story of how Pope John Paul II, beginning with a nine-day pilgrimage, with courage and conviction, love and the gospel message, confronted the evil that plagued his native Poland for decades under the form of Marxist Communism.

His method was simply to tell the Polish people and the world the truth about their Human Personhood and their God-given status as children of God.

Inspiring! It is real, well done and well worth it! A wealth of things to learn!",1305331200,15,509,4.7727272727272725
200790,5,1596982004,"I am a 21 year old Catholic down at Texas A&M and was fortunate enough to view the screening of this film with Newt Gingrich. It is an amazing film that every Catholic should watch. It is very well done and I started tearing up with joy a couple of times (which is very rare for me!).It makes me so proud to be Catholic, as well as being thankful to have lived (although I was a child) while John Paul II was pontiff. It was so amazing how many Poles showed up to be with Pope John Paul II in Poland as well as around other parts of the world. You have to realize what was going on at the time, to really appreciate what the Pope was able to accomplish. What an amazing ""documentary"". God bless the Gingrich's for putting this together and may God bless John Paul II (soon to be Saint)and we continue to pray for Pope Benedict the 16th for all that he is doing!!!! I highly recommend this film!",1302998400,21,894,4.14367816091954

7799852,5,1596982004,"This is a fabulous documentary on Pope John Paul II and his impact on Poland, the fall of communism and the world at large.  I have seen many films on the former Pope.  This one is great - historically accurate, educational, emotional and spiritual.

If you like history, economics, sociology, politics, psychology, philosophy, and theology, this film will not disappoint.

It interviews many people who witnessed the events in Poland and the years after.  Their testimonies from many perspectives, representing many countries, are presented and interwoven to tell this story.  It is really well done.

Particularly moving were the Pope's reflections on his visit to Auschwitz in Poland and his visit to Yad Vashem in Israel where he was reunited with a holocaust survivor whom he helped in the 1940's.
