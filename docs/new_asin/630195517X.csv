384712,4,630195517X,"My expectations going in to this film were pretty high given its critical acclaim and reputation. Grizzly Man is the only other Herzog film I have seen and it happens to be my current favorite documentary of all time, so needless to say I was quite excited to see another film by him. And I'm happy to report that, although on a first viewing I didn't love it to quite the same degree as Grizzly Man, Aguirre: The Wrath of God definitely did not disappoint.

I was quite interested to see what Herzog's style would be like as a filmmaker working with his own script and actors rather than as a documentarian. Based only on this film, he definitely seems to have a very deliberate, methodical air to his direction. The entire film is very even-toned and it slides along at a steady pace that feels neither fast nor slow. There is definitely an emotional coldness to the film that feels almost Kubrickian. None of the characters are very relatable or likable; quite the contrary in fact - they are consumed by greed, selfishness and delusions of grandeur, our ""hero"" in particular. Thus, there is an emotional distance between the audience and the characters that is definitely reminiscent of a Kubrick film.

And ironically, despite the fact that I turned to this movie as my first Herzog non-documentary, the film almost feels like a documentary. The way the film is shot with handheld camera and without any pomp or dramatization makes everything feel so real and authentic. It's very obvious that everything in the film was done for real on location and that is to its advantage as you really feel like you're there with these men rather than just watching a dramatization.

This ultra-realism also works very well in bringing the themes of the film through and making them resonate. The film is clearly about man's misguided and even delusional thirst for power. Aguirre embodies this more than anyone in the film - a man with very clear delusions of grandeur who fancies himself a god despite clear evidence that his expedition is futile and doomed to failure. Klaus Kinski gives a spectacular performance in this role which is even more impressive given his relatively minimal amount of dialogue. He just has such an ominous presence on screen, his face perpetually twisted in a snarl, and he becomes almost hypnotic to watch as the film goes on.

And it isn't just Aguirre. Essentially every Spaniard in the film engages in treachery at least once, including the holy man who utters one of the most searing lines of the film: ""You know, my child, for the good of our Lord, the Church was always on the side of the strong."" Ouch. These men commit mutiny, elect ""emperors"", make grand declarations of land ownership, and hold trials with their only audience being the indifferent tangle of vegetation and the raging river. The realism of the film perfectly captures how delusional these men really are as they parade around with their notions of power and fame in the middle of the jungle. Nothing could be further from the truth as they slowly succumb one by one, lost in a foreign and foreboding land. And their impossible goal of finding El Dorado, the imaginary city of gold, is the perfect metaphor for their delusion. A great strength of the film is that the way this theme is executed feels so universal. Herzog isn't just showing us the madness of these particular men in this particular scenario, he's showing us the madness of man in general. He showing us that these illusions of power are just that - illusions. In the grand scheme of the world and the universe, the titles of men are meaningless and transient.

Aguirre: The Wrath of God is a powerful film and an impressive achievement from a filmmaking perspective. However, it is definitely not a movie that is out to entertain or dazzle its audience. It is a film of ideas rather than plot or spectacle. Really the only criticism I can make of the film on a first viewing is that there were some moments of humor which felt a bit out of place given the tone of the film - a man makes a quip after being shot with an arrow or a decapitated head speaks its last word. There is definitely an absurdity to the film and you could argue that these scenes play to that, but I felt these moments perhaps went a bit to far and were too cartoony to mesh well within the film's fabric of realism. Regardless, it's a minor complaint which does very little to sour an otherwise excellent film.",1461196800,,4451,4.636248415716096

384807,4,630195517X,"For years, I thought this was Herzog's best, tightest dramatic narrative. Seeing the film again recently, I think that this effect is achieved entirely through Herzog's use of the remote South American location. His theory about the ""voodoo of location"" was completely correct -- the film opens with an epic, completely wordless depiction of Pizarro's army trudging through the Andes, at times barely visible against the vast, mist-shrouded mountain slope. It's spell-binding, and the film hasn't even properly started.

In terms of dramatic content, large parts of ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" are completely aimless. It is impossible to remember the order in which events occur. Much of the dialogue, such as it is, deals with the machinations of Aguirre against Don Ursua. Ultimately, this has little significance. Herzog does briefly show the conquistadors' reluctance to mutiny (Aguirre's figurehead Emperor weeps upon hearing the proclamation of rebellion read in his name), perhaps flirting with the theme of how ordinary people can be browbeaten into following a charismatic killer without really believing in his cause, but the flunkies are all quite interchangeable, and Aguirre's motivational speech quickly gives way to ominous glaring.

Parts of the film are well-suited to a straightforward anti-colonialist reading. The Catholic monk is grossly corrupt and hypocritical from the moment he appears on screen (Herzog seems to dislike Catholicism -- recall the ""What dreadful howling!"" bit from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaspar-Hauser/dp/B00005R248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaspar Hauser</a>""). A surprisingly large amount of screen time is devoted to public readings of documents, which clearly come across as demonstrating the colonizers' perverse compulsion to cover their actions with lengthy legalistic justifications. The soldiers rush to loot and burn the native villages as soon as they see them. The natives are depicted with sincere sympathy, more so than in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitzcarraldo/dp/B00001ODHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitzcarraldo</a>,"" where Kinski's colonizer was himself a bit more sympathetic.

Nonetheless, I think that these scenes and dialogue are really only there as placeholders. A guy is shot through the body with an arrow, and out of the blue he croaks, ""Long arrows are in fashion this year!"" before dropping dead. This is funny, but it suggests that Herzog was really bored by having to having to come up with a script. In fact, I think he was. He pays attention to historical detail (like Pizarro's illiteracy), but really the plot of ""Aguirre"" matters very little. The entire film is an excuse for Herzog to present two brilliant, grandiose images. The first is the opening image of the pass through the Andes. The second is the closing image, the camera gracefully sweeping around Klaus Kinski as he stands alone on the monkey-infested raft. These last scenes, where a hallucinatory boat inexplicably appears in a treetop with no auditory cues, are pure poetry. The screeching swarm of monkeys is a brutal symbol of the pointlessness of the whole enterprise. The dialogue may not be memorable, but no one ever forgets the final scene.

The open secret of the film, known to anyone familiar with Herzog's career, is that Herzog admires Aguirre's lunatic drive. He doesn't really care about what motivates Aguirre, how or why he seized power. At the beginning, Aguirre seems to be one of Pizarro's more sensible advisors, warning him that the expedition is hopeless, and then the next moment he starts telling the soldiers stories about Cortes. But this also turns out to be irrelevant, as Aguirre declares close to the end that he despises his men because they are easily swayed by promises of money. His only motivation is the nihilistic drive to be ""the great traitor."" But Herzog also despises Aguirre's men, for the same reasons, and depicts them as greedy, vicious and cowardly when he bothers to spend any time on them at all. When Aguirre first announces that he is the wrath of God (thus making it clear that he's insane, not just ambitious), he stares directly into Herzog's camera, which takes him seriously and gives his words their full weight. The only other character to be acknowledged by the film as an individual is Ursua's wife, whose silent walk offscreen is just as self-destructive as Aguirre's madness, and therefore is also treated with dignity (essentially celebrated).

That's not a nice message (Herzog is a very cruel director), but for better or for worse, this film had a unique vision, and we won't see its like again. Its main ""payoff"" may be contained within a small proportion of the running time, but its visual language is unforgettable and incomparable to other films. The wild Amazon scenery makes it ""real,"" but not purely literally -- for example, you can see water drops on the camera lens, but that only makes the film seem more realistic since it shows that they're actually there in the rainforest. The alien setting makes it easy to put up with the slower parts, and easier to accept Aguirre's unmotivated madness and Klaus Kinski's brooding scowl, which hints that there's something he's not telling us before he finally does.

In his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/autobiography/dp/0670867446/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">autobiography</a>, Kinski naturally took all the credit for the film (and claimed that he ""rescued"" it from Herzog's alleged incompetence). Herzog, in the deceptively pleasant documentary ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Best-Fiend/dp/6305970955/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Best Fiend</a>,"" likewise said that he deliberately let Kinski scream his lungs out for hours before filming the final take with the more nuanced, seething performance. Probably both are true -- this film could never have been made by anyone else, and in any other place or time.",1424649600,2,6057,5.599781897491821

384914,5,630195517X,"Late in the narrative of Aguirre, The Wrath of God, a group of conquistadors - ragged, starving and floating down the Amazon on a makeshift raft - see a rotting Spanish ship suspended high upon the forest canopy in a giant tree. They marvel at it. How did it get there? How long has it been there? No one knows, and the river pushes the boat on. I mention this scene because it's a good microcosm of Aguirre, the Wrath of God: mad, surreal, awe-inspiring, and absurd.

The story, concerning an expedition of desperate and ill-prepared conquistadors and their search for El Dorado and gold in the Amazon, is utterly secondary to the images and the tone. As the good Roger Ebert said, Werner Herzog has directed good films and failed films, but never one to be ashamed of. Well this is one to be proud of. Aguirre is one of cinema's greatest achievements and anyone who hasn't seen it is missing out. Hyperbole is rampant in film criticism, but put down the grain of salt. You will not be needing it!

Werner Herzog is proudly crazy. He's filmed on the slope of an active volcano, and he's filmed six hours into the Amazon jungle. He wrote the screenplay for Aguirre on a bus filled with rowdy soccer players, and when one of them vomited on the pages, he promptly threw them out the window and started again. Aguirre was filmed on a stolen camera (!) in the Amazonian jungle, where fever, starvation, or drowning were real possibilities. As Herzog and his cast and crew drifted down the Amazon River on rafts made by Indian tribesmen, they must have wondered if this was how the conquistadors felt as they searched for El Dorado - the city of gold.

And its a good thing that Herzog did all that. The madness and desperation seeps through the camera. His main star, Klaus Kinski, was quite possibly unhinged, and was only convinced to stay on the film after Herzog threatened to shoot Kinski and then himself if he left. Kinski's performance as the menacing, raving, insane Aguirre is one of cinema's finest, mostly because it was so true to life. It's a terrifying performance, and one of cinema's most memorable. There's a moment when Aguirre looks directly into the camera, and I would have sworn a snake slithered up my spine.

In the end, this is not a film that needs a lot of words said about it. It must be experienced to be understood. But I will say that it's unforgettable, terrifying, darkly comic, transcendent, insane, and beautiful. If you haven't seen Aguirre already, experience the wrath of god and the euphoria of cinema like you haven't before. Cheers!",1422489600,13,2571,4.619256017505471

384921,4,630195517X,"Aguirre is an okay film about Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century Amazon.  The story recounts how a gold crazed spaniard, played by the very ""Aryan"" appearing Kinski, leads his expedition on wild goose chase after the mythical city of gold, El Dorado.  The directing is fine, story mildly gripping, but I am slightly perplexed by the torrents of praise emanating from the art house set.  Likewise I am amused at the cult status this movie seems to enjoy among intelletual neo Nazi types.  The movie is an anti-Nazi allegory.  Kinski's character is mad, power hungry, persuing an insane quest on a road to ultimate self destruction.  He slays or drives away any voice of reason which tries to persuade him to a sane pathway.  Finally, when he slays the Cortez character, played by a dark, hooked nosed, perhaps semitic-appearing Spaniard, his path to destruction is set.  I believe this allegorizes the persection/slaying of the Jews by Nazi Germany.  Later, the allegory is confirmed when Kinski, in his uttermost delirium, raves ""I will breed myself against my daughter and create the purest race imaginable"", clearly a reference to the Nazi preoccupation with purity of blood.  This line doesn't even fit the context of the movie's plot, so it is clearly a reference to some political subtext.
  Come to think of it, I have answered my own conundrum; the art house set likes the liberal subtext of the movie.  Neo nazis are stupid on average and don't even get it!  I believe this reflects a continuation of a device, inaugurated as far as I can see in Leni Riefenstahl's ""Tiefland"" ,in which the ethnic diversity of the Iberian peninsula is employed to allegorize political topics, particularly related to the WW2 period.  Spirit of the Beehive continues this motif to some extent.",1403568000,,1791,4.923333333333333

385035,5,630195517X,"This is an adrenaline-rich, tense and eye-popping movie based on the 1650 to 1651 expedition of Spanish Conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) that bogged down in the jungles of Peru while searching for El Dorado, the rumored seven cities of gold.  It was filmed without special effects using a cast of eight, crew of five and large numbers of Peruvian locals.  The opening scene is a strong hint of what is to come.  It includes hundreds of Peruvian men descending an almost vertical face of a mist-shrouded mountain.  The film appears to be filmed in seemingly impenetrable jungles on land and in dangerously turbulent and swift-flowing rivers.  Being small in number and dwarfed by an overpowering environment, the members of the cast seem dwarfed and strangely out of place.  As the expedition proceeds downriver in rafts, the members encounter disease, starvation and angry natives who feel invaded.  Differences of opinion over the value of the expedition, what should be done next and who should lead erupt as one by one, the expedition members are picked off by native arrows and other causes until Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) who brought his daughter along and originally was not in charge acquires an intense zest for power, matches it with outrage, threatens the remaining members and commits acts of violence impressive enough to take over the expedition.  Eventually, Aguirre and his daughter are the only remaining members of the expedition moving downstream on the only remaining raft.  As Aguirre continues to rant about his plan to marry his daughter, have many children and build a mighty new civilization in the jungle, his daughter is struck by a native arrow and dies, leaving Aguirre to rant alone with only the jungle and its inhabitants to hear him.

385038,3,630195517X,"My film-fanatic friend put this on my ""must-see"" list.  I did see it, and it didn't deserve to be on that list, but it's not a bad movie, just an overrated one.  Visually, it's quite amazing, giving us the feel that a guy with a camera just happened to be in the hinterlands of South America in the 1500s, getting footage of the Spanish conquistadores (who are speaking German) and their encounters with the native Indians.  This was made in the 1970s, when Europeans and a lot of Americans enjoyed wallowing in white guilt, so if you're into that sort of pleasure, you might love the movie. (White guilt generally gets a movie excellent reviews.  Remember Dances with Wolves?)

One problem with the movie is that there is not one character in the movie that you root for. The Indians use arrows and poison darts to pick off the Spanish as they float downstream on a raft, but since we barely see the Indians, they're not presented as human individuals that we can sympathize with.  At the beginning, the friar who accompanies the conquistadors seems like a decent fellow, but before the movie ends he too is caught up in the group's lust for gold, spurred on by the nutty Aguirre, who severs the group's connection with the Spanish government and manages to convince his comrades that they will find gold and set up their own little empire.  Not to give away too much, but things don't work out quite that way.  The ending is, to put it mildly, very memorable (you will never look at monkeys the same way again), and the viewer is left with the impression that crazy Aguirre really is the wrath of God, divine vengeance on this band of gold-hungry slobs who have no respect for human life.  In the last shot of Aguirre, you might find yourself thinking of the old Seals and Crofts song ""The King of Nothing.""",1376006400,2,1809,4.541538461538462
385039,5,630195517X,"For Herzog truth comes out of the artist's grappling with his subject matter. His fictional films are linked to his documentaries: he is not simply a storyteller but a participant shaman invoking history, reliving extraordinary events in the past. Fiction and reality are explosively blended together in the figure of actor Kinski playing the mad ambition and hubris of Don Lope de Aguerre,with eagle eyes and swivelling, lurching body, screaming mad and creating havoc on the set for Herzog,who's attempting to realize the hallucinatory strangeness of the conquistador's undertaking, colonial conquest run amuck. Far from Castille,this is a tale of moral degradation in the heart of darkness. Herzog ""stages history,like others stage plays""( spoken by Kinski's insane conquistador).We get a sense of historical adventure,combined with risk-taking cinematic history,awesome power and mystery,realism and presence.

It's as if Herzog breathed in upon a ""peak in Darien"" to evoke those who"" travelled in realms of gold"".These men were mad,full of visions and hallucinations, driven by lust for power and glory,to follow in the footsteps of Cortez, The Peruvian river settings are in truth deadly dangerous, and Herzog expertly captures the immense power of nature against man. The pace is fast and the destructive and ominous theme of power confused with madness, strong and powerful. But while it is over quite quickly, the film sits with you far beyond the running time. Despite problems such as the dangerous rain forest location, illness amongst the crew and a screaming mad Klaus Kinski, Herzog somehow manages to create a hypnotic tale about greed, power and madness. Set in 16th century Peru, the film centres on the expedition of a group of conquistadores to the lost city of El Dorado.

The film has been criticized for having no narrative. I disagree. The forward momentum is aided by the hazards,the hardships,the madness that draws these people into the jungle in the first place(and Herzog for undertaking the same mad journey,subjecting crew,actors and extras to the same hazards and hardships). Almost immediately, the group begins to fragment, with a forward expedition being sent on, and this continual unravelling will be the main dynamic of the narrative as we follow them on their hopeful(but to us obviously hopeless)quest. There is a rhythmic flow of documentary-like imagery, heavily stylized epic shots with great costumes, colour, soundscapes, cinematography, capturing the awesome power of untameable nature and a constant sense of dread of the unknown, effectively assisted by the haunting Popol Vuh score. Insulated from the threat of retribution from the Spanish government, Aguirre begins to subvert Ursua's authority,citing Cortez who disobeyed orders to conquer Mexico. Aguirre dissents on the rescue of a crew aboard a raft stranded on the side of the river. He instructs the men to gather materials without Ursua's knowledge or consent. He orders the death of a soldier loyal to Ursua.

However,the path to El Dorado proves to be elusive as the crew fall victim to treacherous currents,inconspicuously laden traps, and Indian attacks. Driven by the promise of wealth and conquest, Aguirre forces a mutiny when Ursua decides to retreat into the mountains. The noble ideal of civilizing indigenous people are only rationalizations of greed and narcissm-as elusive as El Dorado-deceptive goals. Using recurring animal imagery, Herzog distills human behavior to its base, primeval instincts: the transportation of caged chickens down the formidable mountain; the mistreatment of a horse on the raft; the capture of a wild boar at a deserted village; the relocation of baby rats by its mother; the plague of monkeys in the final sequence.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' is one of those films that wins points for the story behind how it was made and not for the actual film itself. Created by famed German New Wave director, Werner Herzog, when he was twenty-eight years old, 'Aguirre' was created in insufferable conditions in the Peruvian rain forest on the Amazon River over a five week period, with Herzog directing hundreds of extras including local natives who built rafts for the cast and crew. Herzog and his crew escaped death right before filming when they were bumped off a plane at the last minute, that ended up crashing into the jungle, killing all aboard except one. Herzog also had to deal with his volatile star, Klaus Kinski, who fired a rifle at some extras who he objected to being too rowdy during the film's production. Miraculously, no one was killed, with only one man losing a fingertip!

'Aguirre' is a work of fiction but it's based on two historical accounts which Herzog melded together in two and a half days. All the major characters including Aguirre were involved in a 1560 expedition that left Peru to find the mythical city of El Dorado. Ursa, appointed by the Peruvian governor, led the expedition, but was murdered upon orders of Aguirre, whose goal was to overthrow the ruling Spanish government. Herzog also makes use of an earlier expedition, beginning in 1541, which involved Francisco de Orellana, who led a group down the river searching for El Dorado, upon orders of the famed explorer, Pizarro. During this expedition, Gasper de Carvajal kept a journal, which forms the basis of the narration in Herzog's fictional story.

When 'Aguirre' was made, in 1971, a new wave of American directors, had already established themselves as anti-establishment, attempting to present the dark side to current American culture as well as its history in films such as 'Little Big Man', 'Easy Rider' and 'Bonnie and Clyde'. Herzog attempts to debunk the myth of a golden age of European exploration by proffering up the surly Kinski as the cruel monomaniac, Aguirre, who reminds one of the crazed Hitler inside the bunker in the German film, 'Downfall'. Rather than a group of enlightened Renaissance men, Herzog's soldiers are religious fanatics who lose all perspective on reality in their crazed quest for gold. In one telling scene, the monk Carvajal, exhorts the soldiers to murder two natives who mistakenly throw a Bible to the ground because they are unable to hear the actual spoken word of God, emanating from the book.

While 'Aguirre' is seriously short on character development, there are enough 'events', that will keep you mildly interested. Early on, a few of the men are caught in a whirlpool on one of the rafts, and are found the next day, murdered by natives, with arrows and spears protruding from their bloated bodies. Soon afterward, Aguirre takes over the expeditionary force by shooting Ursa. Surprisingly, he's given a short reprieve after the fat nobleman, Guzman, is appointed 'Emperor', and spares his life. When the jungle is completely flooded and virtually all of their rafts destroyed, Herzog has his crew build new rafts and incorporates the new change in circumstances as part of the story. The plot thickens a bit when Guzman is found murdered and Aguirre finally has Ursa disposed of. In one of the most dramatic scenes in the film, Ursa's mistress, walks off into the rain forest, disgusted by Aguirre's cruelty.

One gets the impression that Herzog seeks to present his tale of bad guy explorers as a documentary, shot in cinema verit style. There's an air of self-congratulation here, with Herzog constantly reminding us how depraved his greedy conquistadors really are. After awhile, it becomes more and more obvious, that Herzog merely seeks credit for being on the 'winning side'. One doesn't need an entire film such as this one, to conclude that the people who founded the 'New World', mistreated the native population in an abominable way and were guided by a materialistic spirit of the crassest nature. Nonetheless, things could have been a little more interesting, if some of the really bad apples had a few ambiguous (sympathetic?) spots here and there. On the other hand, it would be presumptuous to assume that a 28 year old director is capable of presenting complex characters that we come to expect from a master such as Ingmar Bergman.

In the end, despite Herzog's masterful attempt to brave the elements while filming 'Aguirre', his characters don't have enough shades of gray to convince us that the great quest for El Dorado actually happened as Herzog would like us to believe. For those who believe that 'Aguirre' deserves accolades as a 'masterpiece', mainly due to Kinski's performance, I fail to see how that's possible. With his surly, threatening demeanor, Kinski as Aguirre is hardly acting at all. Rather, this is how Kinski acted in real life. As for the character of Aguirre, he's such a one-note concoction with all the nastiness, that he comes off more as a buffoon than someone who's actually scary. At the denouement, Aguirre's monomania is so obvious, that we care more about the cute monkeys than such a pathetic lunatic.

The actors in 'Aguirre' mainly spoke English but the original audio could not be used due to its poor quality. The copy I saw was dubbed into German but Kinski did not participate in the dubbing--his million dollar fee was way beyond Herzog's budget. For those who can't stand dubbed movies, this may be another reason why you won't find 'Aguirre: Wrath of God', to be very endearing.",1344470400,5,5636,4.91281512605042
385136,5,630195517X,"Imagine this: A 28-year-old steals a 35 mm camera from a film school, heads to the South American jungle, and, with a miniscule budget, convinces 450 actors and extras - many of whom do not speak his language - to not only endure jungle heat and insects and sleep in a communal barn but also to trek over a muddy mountain with alpacas and horses and with heavy equipment on their backs and to board small, hand-crafted rafts on a river that, if you fell in, you'd be sucked under and killed. And imagine that this 28-year-old, after making up the script as he goes along, shooting most of the scenes only once, and editing the film in only a month, ends up creating what Roger Ebert named one of the 10 best films, period.

The story of the making of this film is almost as insane as the film itself. On their way to the jungle, the cast and crew were at the last minute diverted from a plane that ended up crashing, killing 90+ people. (28 years later, Werner made a documentary about the sole survivor called Wings of Hope.) Once there, resources were extremely scarce. Werner sometimes had to sell his boots or his wristwatch just to get breakfast. The total budget was $370,000 (or about $1.9 million in today's dollars) and one-third of that went to the lead actor, Klaus Kinski. Kinski, by the way, was about as mad and uncontrollable on the set as he appears in the film. One night he became so infuriated at the noise created by the partying extras that he randomly fired three shots into the barn. He was lucky he didn't kill anyone. Later he hit someone so hard in the head with his sword that had the person not been wearing an iron helmet his skull would have been split.

When Werner was asked how he dealt with all this when he was only 28, he responded, ""I had a clear perspective and I was fortified with enough philosophy to get through it.""

That perspective/philosophy is not only what allows Werner to complete such ambitious films, it's also what makes his films worth watching. There is a reason he went through all the jungle-imposed trouble. Said Werner, ""In this film, human beings are put to the real test. You can learn more about ourselves this way than from a film that takes place in a car, a restaurant, and on the telephone. The purpose of the jungle is to explore what is the bottom line of our existence, and how do we behave under particular strains and stresses, and then you gain much deeper insights into our very nature.""

In this film (and in all of his films), the jungle is not just a scenic backdrop, it is a character itself. It causes the other characters to go insane and it, too, grows increasingly insane. But Werner doesn't consider the jungle exotic. ""It's just another forest.""

What's particularly hypnotizing about the movie is the images. Images like the woman in the royal gown walking straight into the jungle, or like the 400 monkeys scurrying around a raft full of corpses, or like the unendurable silence that everyone knows means death, or like the horse being shoved off the raft and then standing on the shoreline, perfectly still but slowly disappearing. The film alternates between spontaneous documentary-like shots and highly-stylized frozen still-lifes. Instead of showing close ups of the actors' faces, it shows characters from behind so that we have to project emotions into them. It uses a choir organ that sounds vaguely but not quite like the human voice. And the bird calls are carefully timed to maximize tension.

As much as I adore this movie, it doesn't sit well with me that this is Herzog's best-known film (outside of Grizzly Man). At times, it has the feel of a movie created by a 28-year-old. Especially in comparison to his later movies, there is more blood and action and dark humor and overt metaphors. Fitzcarraldo is, in plot, a very similar film, but since it was created 10 year later it is substantially more mature. Please don't let this be the only Herzog film you see.

Here are some other things to help you appreciate this film:

* Werner kept telling Kinski to ""move like a crab."" Kinski did this to great effect--genuinely frightening most of the cast.
* Since there was such a small budget, Werner did all the costume design himself, with ""help"" (quotes deserved) from Kinski.
* The corpse shown in the 50th minute is a real mummy. It is extremely fragile so bringing it to the set was a real challenge. They actually purchased an extra plane ticket for the mummy and sat it next to Werner's brother on the plane.
* Werner: ""I've never storyboarded anything in my life. I think it's a disease of Hollywood.""
* At one point, over an artistic disagreement of how his character should behave, Kinski threatened to leave the set. Werner threatened in return that if he turned around, there would be 8 bullets in his back. He was serious. Kinski was well-behaved ""for the next 10 days.""
* The same stolen camera that he used for this film he used in 8 other films. But he doesn't like to consider it ""theft."" ""It was just a necessity--I had some sort of natural right for a camera, a tool to work with.""
* Much of this information comes from the commentary available on the DVD. Highly recommended.",1342915200,11,5571,4.868143459915612

Here I review the ""Aguirre The Wrath of God (Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes) [NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Great Britain]"" version. And I must disagree with the international accolades heaped on this film, which I had seen before on VHS. It's a very good film. But is it a great film? Err, no.

Much is made of Klaus Kinski's performance in this film, and much should be; he carries the film on his shoulders, no question. That's part of the problem though. There are other characters, but so little effort is made to develop them, they all turn out to be interchangeable arrow fodder.

Likewise those hostile natives casting those arrows. We hear much talk about them, we see their arrows, we see people shot and killed. But we get barely a glimpse of the hostile natives. Director Werner Herzog, I think, wanted them perceived as part of the ""natural"" world being ""invaded"" by these conquistadors. Some sort of anti-colonial/anti-imperialist/pro-ecology message? Maybe Herzog knows, but the viewer does not.

Nonetheless, for all the script's weaknesses, the film lives and dies by Klaus Kinski. His performance is terrific, magnificent, and above all real. Seems a shame more care wasn't given early in the script exploring his character either. Herzog's direction in the final shot, when the camera circles the raft on which Kinski is the lone survivor, while Kinski's character muses over the great fortune that awaits him, is the real payoff of the whole film, and the sole bit (in my opinion) that justifies the film's vast reputation.

So this is a very good film, in my opinion, but not a great one, as is often said.

THE DVD:

This print is widescreen and very clear and pure looking, but also quite dark in many segments. That's likely because of the location-shooting limitations, but there it is, anyway. The disc includes as Special Features only Filmographies of Herzog and Kinski, both of which are incomplete.

The Amazon listing, which I have copied and pasted above, says ""Reg. 2 Import - Great Britain."" Region 2, of course, includes all Europe, not just the UK. Be that as it may, this disc is a fine argument in favor of overdubbing. I know all the arguments in favor of subtitles instead, thank you, and I agree with them, largely. Here, though, all the characters are supposed to be Spanish conquistadors, and yet we are hearing them clearly speak modern German while we read the English subtitles. Tell me, which part exactly would be lost in translation, if we simply got the dubbed-English track once available on VHS?

I recommend BUY if you have enough interest in this title to be reading user reviews. You likely already know what to expect. But remember, you need a DVD player that can play Region 2 discs.",1338681600,,2752,4.789029535864979

This, in my opinion, destroyed the aesthetic of pure documentary, or true improvisation which would have had the actors creating their own dialogue and story.

385267,5,630195517X,"This is a great epic movie, supposedly based on an expedition down the Amazon River in Search for El Dorado, the city of gold. The journey down the lush vegetation and savage and precipitous jungle and down the perilous river began with the great Conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro (1502-1548) and ended with the Basque madman and conquistador, Lope de Aguirre (1510-1561; played by Klaus Kinski). The fictitious movie plot is ostensibly based on the surviving diary of the duplicitous and hypocritical Dominican friar, Gaspar de Carvajal.

To become the leader of the vanguard expedition searching for gold, riches, and power, the treacherous adventurer, Lope de Aguirre, had his immediate superiors Pedro de Ursua (1526-1561) and Fernando de Guzman killed. He even defies Philip II, the King of Spain. But it is important to separate what is fiction and what is history in this cinematographic spectacle and surreal adventure- the ultimate tale of intrigue, betrayal and madness!

The historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500-1584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who accompanied Captain Francisco de Orellana in the historic expedition and discovery of the Amazon River course and estuary. The real Carvajal had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indians. His general attitude towards the Indians was consistent with the benevolence of his better known brother Dominican friar, Bartolome de las Casas. Interestingly Friar Carvajal was born in and came from Trujillo, Extremadura, Spain, the same hard region and city as that of the conquistadors, the Pizarro brothers and Francisco de Orellana (1511-1546).

In 1540, the historic Friar Carvajal joined Gonzalo Pizarro, governor of Quito (so appointed after the conquest of Peru and the Incas), in an expedition to find the ""Land of Cinnamon"" in eastern Peru. The expedition consisted of 200 conquistadores and 4000 Indians. It crossed the Andes mountains and traversed the Amazonian jungle under trying and desperate conditions. They were treading inhospitable jungle, and they carried insufficient provisions. All the indians, serving as servants or slaves, reportedly died in the expedition, and Governor Gonzalo himself barely survived with a handful of his men. The ultimate goal of the ill-fated expedition was the search of the elusive city of gold, El Dorado, which was never found.

In the historic epic saga, Francisco de Orellana, Gonzalo Pizarro's second in Command, asked to lead a search party down the Napo River (a tributary of the Amazon) to find provisions with 64 men. He was approved, and Orellana went down the rivers in rapidly constructed rafts (as in the movie). They reached a great confluence of the rivers, but he was unable to return due to the strong current, so the party continued down the Amazon river until it reached its estuary in the Atlantic in 1542. Orellana and his men agonized over this turn of events, just as Ursua and Guzman did in the movie version with Lope de Aguirre.  They suspected Gonzalo would call them traitors (which the great conquistador did but died before he could press charges in the court of Spain). In their journey, they actually found many populated, peaceful indigenous trading centers along the river, but the survivors were not fully believed. Orellana made it to Spain, was allowed to return, and died lost in the jungle in a subsequent expedition (1546).

Friar Carvajal  was one of the survivors of the first, historic Orellana expedition, and it is from his narrative- which was later published as, ""Account of the recent discovery of the famous Grand river which was discovered by great good fortune by Captain Francisco de Orellana""- that we know of the details and travails of the expedition.  Recent ethnographic and archeological research has judged the narrative to have been extremely accurate. But this is not the narrative of the expedition of Lope de Aguirre depicted in the movie.

In Werner Herzog's epic movie, Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972)- the account of Gaspar de Carvajal which took place in Orellana's expedition is mixed with the mad journey of Lope de Aguirre down the Amazon river, which took place almost twenty years later in 1561. Lope de Aguirre, actually led 186 conquistadors down the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers, pillaging and plundering as he went. He is reputed to have proclaimed: ""I am the Wrath of God, Lord of Tierra Firme and the Provinces of Chile."" Aguirre, just as in the movie did become the leader of an expedition and subsequent colonization of an island off Venezuela, and he did have his immediate superiors Pedro de Ursua (1526-1561) and Fernando de Guzman killed. He even defied Philip II, the King of Spain. Aguirre was executed in Venezuela after his rebellion against the Spanish Crown had been suppressed. His body was quartered and scattered throughout Venezuela as a traitor.

But I will not tell you how the fictitious Aguirre fared and how the expedition ended in the movie. Suffice to say, it is an epic movie of surreal, cinematographic wonders; incredible jungle, river, and mountain scenes; and unspeakable betrayal. This epic movie by the master German film director, Werner Herzog, is definitely worth seeing and well deserves a 5-star rating. It is indeed a stunning, hypnotic masterpiece!

Included in the journey along with the conquistadors are hundreds of native Peruvian slaves & 2 Spanish women. One is the wife of a conquistador & the other the daughter of Aguirre.

From that point on the result of the expedition is detailed out to what one might expect. The details of the journey, supposedly coming out of a journal kept by the priest, along with the development of Aguirre's personality, is interesting. It is the filming that you want to see this show for though. Not your normal sets or 'on location' conditions.

385272,5,630195517X,"""Aguirre"" (1972) is directed by Werner Herzog (Fitzcarraldo) and was filmed on location in the Peruvian rain forest on the Amazon River. The movie is loosely based on Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) who was involved in a 1560 expedition that left Peru to find the city of El Dorado. Herzog combined this story with another Amazonian journey of Gonzalo Pizarro in 1541-1542. In real life Aguirre was a professional soldier who decided he could overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru with the 300 men on the journey. Aguirre murdered Ursua and proclaimed Guzman the ""Prince of Peru"", and eventually also murdered Guzman. As with many of Herzog's films the actors were pushed to the limits in the filming of this movie as they had to climb up mountains, hack through thick jungle, and ride river rapids on rafts built by natives. During the filming a storm flooded the river and subsequently buried the film sets and destroyed the rafts. This flooding was incorporated into the movie. The film has a hypnotic quality that takes one down the path of madness and hallucination. Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film ""Apocalypse Now"" would be influenced by this film's visual style and narrative elements.

Listen, filming a movie with a handheld camera does not automatically anoint a director ""a genius.""  Nor does having actors haul a raft, a cannon, assorted dead bodies and two perfectly-coiffured mademoiselles through a jungle qualify you as Orson Welles.

In fact, here's what all the people who've given this movie 5 stars should do. ... Round up a dozen of your friends and haul a cannon, assorted dead bodies and two perfectly-coiffured mademoiselles through if not a jumgle then let's say downtown traffic at rush hour.

385359,5,630195517X,"This is a wonderful historical film about a doomed expedition that is largely historical fact.  Finding himself unable to continue, Pizarro sends Aguirre and 40 men into the jungle to search for El Dorado, the golden city. It is a strange venture, encumbered by aristocratic women in sedan chairs and primitive weapons, and seeded by the ambition of founding a new empire.  Aguirre takes over by force and leads the men to nowhere, ignorant of their surroundings, renegade, and prey to supposed cannibals.  It can only end in obscure death, yet he rants to the end.

What is so incredible about the film is the tone that Herzog and Kinsky achieve, a sense of chaos and impossible ambition of Caesarian proportion, even declaring themselves the founders of a country and assuming they will conquer a continent on their own.  As they descend farther into the unknown, Aguirre's insanity becomes undeniable.  Then comes murder, blistering rages, and steady loss of men.  It is a splendidly frightening journey into one man's obsession with power and riches, the very reason that America was colonized.  The men are so primitive, much closer to a medieval than to a modern or even Renaissance mentality.  The actors are excellent as well.

This is about as un-Hollywood as you can get.  Shot on a shoestring, with a story that ends in annihilation and lack of meaning or resolution.

The masterpiece of mood and implied meanings can be appreciated on so many levels. It is above all an artfully made movie, with beautiful cinematography and a haunting sound track.

385362,5,630195517X,"Werner Herzog may just be the best film director of the last forty years. Period. And I mean worldwide. While some directors of film rely primarily on precision- think Alfred Hitchcock, intellect- think Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick, visual poesy-think Terrence Malick, or visceral reaction- think Akira Kurosawa, there is no other major filmmaker that I can think of who combines all of these things so skillfully, as well as having a mastery of music, outside of Herzog. From musical scoring to narrative pacing to visual imagery, he reigns supreme. Before watching his 1972 masterpiece, Aguirre: The Wrath Of God (Aguirre, Der Zorn Gottes), for the first time, all I had seen of Herzog were some of his documentary style films and Fitzcarraldo. This was enough to intrigue me to explore his corpus more fully, and I'm glad I did, for there's a reason this film made him a `name' on par with his contemporary German directors, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders.
  Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is a film that combines the best elements of such diverse great films as Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Apocalypse Now, although it is a much more visceral work than any of those films, and is topped off by one of the truly great screen performances of all time, with Klaus Kinski as the titular lead, Don Lope de Aguirre, a cripple who may also be a hunchback- whose outer deformities seem to have scarred him internally, as well. While there are numerous other supporting characters that turn in fine performances, Kinski utterly dominates the screen every second he's on it, moving like some perverse and slavering arachnid, moving in for the kill of an insect he will never bleed fully for he will never truly get it....Many critics often opt out of a real discussion of Herzog's excellence in craft by falling back on the old and misguided notion that he simplistically follows his whims and is guided by the same sort of madness he accuses Kinski of always fostering. Yet, any look at a film like this shows that Herzog transcends such myopic claims, even if unwittingly; although I seriously doubt the man who is such a scrupulous artist has ever let a foot of film be released under his name without a bit of wit applied to it. As for the screenplay? It is brilliant, knowing when to let the characters speak, and what they should say, and also relying on chance events, such as a flood which washed away Herzog's rafts. He incorporated that misfortune into the tale. Yet, what the film ultimately says means less than the whole experience, or how it is said through the art. Herzog's small budget becomes a strength when he cannot do overhead shots from a plane, or elaborate crane shots, nor delving close ups that gradually close in on someone, nor elaborate retakes....Herzog admits with justified pride that this film succeeds precisely because it does not follow the Hollywood formula: there is no real hero to root for, no predictable victory to cheer for, no visible bad guys, and no romantic interest for the leading character. Herzog amply demonstrates his superior art in the scene right after Ursua is taken away to be hung. His wife, Inez, who is repulsed by Aguirre, not attracted to him- as would be de rigueur in a Hollywood film, is shown in a shot from behind, simply gazing down at the dark and mystical river. The symbolism is simple, but immense and erotic, in its mix of death and sex, yet we never see her beautiful face, nor her svelte supple body heave. Herzog does not need to tell us that the woman is mourning her murdered husband. He thinks highly enough of his audience to assume that we get that, and also why she then later walks off into the jungle, albeit in a clean golden dress that comes out of nowhere (movie magic, Herzog proclaims in the commentary), sort of like all the stuff the refugees on Gilligan's Island somehow had. Similar scenes, featuring a captured Incan prince, reduced to slavery and interpretation with the natives, and the black slave Okello (Edward Roland- whose character was named after Zanzibarian madmen John Okello, from whose deluded speeches Herzog culled many of Aguirre's speeches), sketch real depths to these characters in only a few strokes.
  Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is an indisputable masterpiece, and one of the greatest films not only of German cinema, but human cinema. That Herzog directed it when he was only twenty-eight years old is astonishing. Its combination of improvisation- for Herzog loathes storyboards, calling them the `disease of Hollywood', with an almost Bergmanian chamber drama focus on an individual, also makes it one of the most unique films ever crafted. It is a film to be seen by anyone with a love of art, intellect, and human nature, at any age, and in any age.",1220659200,6,4780,4.776299879081016

385364,5,630195517X,"So shouts Klaus Kinski's Aguirre (a play on the French word for ""war""?) at one point in this beautiful but intensely disturbing film.  The story is simple and familiar:  European conquistadores rampage through the ""New World"" in search of glory, power, and wealth, and are eventually destroyed by the very world they seek to subdue.

In Herzog's hands, however, this familiar tale is told with all the poignancy it deserves.  The mountains and jungles that surround the conquistadores create a sense of relentless isolation and loneliness--surely exactly what Joseph Conrad wanted to convey in ""Heart of Darkness.""  The foolish pride of greedy men is expressed in the absurd conceit of making one of the band the emperor of the New World, and dressing him in a tattered purple blouse (he eventually dies of diarrhea, a fitting end).  The barbarism of the conquistadores becomes fully revealed in the primeval jungle, where inhibitions drop away one by one.  At one point, the band runs across the remains of a cannibal village, but it's clear that Herzog wants viewers to ask themselves who the real cannibals are.  Toward film's end, everyone is dead save Aquirre, the evil genius of the band, and he's mad and doomed, captaining a tattered raft crawling with jungle monkeys and raving that he will marry his (dead) daughter and create a New World dynasty that will last forever.  We, the viewers, of course know better.  The forest will silently close over him, and it will be as if he never existed.

The interesting question raised by the film is just what Aguirre (and by implication, most of the rest of us) is a ""great traitor"" to.  Most obviously the crown he vowed to serve, but more deeply to--what?  Human dignity?  Virtue?  Ideals?  Reason?  God?  This is the pat answer, but Herzog seems not to rest content with it.  After all, the jungle closes in on the virtuous as well as the villainous, destroying each indiscriminately.

When the journey appears doomed and the leader wants to return the men commit mutiny under the influence of Don Aguirre, who appears initially as a voice of reason and pragmatism but who becomes paranoid and delusional as the jungle and the river and the natives slowly but surely begin to decimate his crew.

At its most basic this is a story of a man's descent into madness, Herzog's variation on Conrad's vision of a heart of darkness that the so-called civilized man discovers as he enters the jungle and comes into contact with the so-called savage.  Herzog's camera powerfully depicts an unrelenting and all-encompassing nature, the powerful and untamed river, the endless and overwhelming vegetation on its shore, a nature that overwhelms and even mocks the futile and in the end pitiful efforts of the Spaniards to maintain the trappings of dignity and ceremony.  The pace of the story meanders like the river and captures the feeling of a slow descent, deep and inexorable, both dreamlike and intensely realistic.

At the same time, the film works as an unmistakeable -- even if blunt, it is certainly powerful -- metaphor that speaks to the ultimate absurdity of the pretensions to control and domination over nature and ""the other"" that characterize European and American history.  In the end, Herzog seems to say, in spite of our humanistic ideals of mastery over nature and control over resources and conversion of all ""outsiders"" to ""our"" way of life, we are headed wrecklessly on a path of self-destruction and only nature will remain.  (This is the basic story he has Brad Dourif tell in the engaging ""Wild Blue Yonder,"" a picture of human beings who are in some ways admirable precisely in the naivety that leads them to pursue projects that are ultimately doomed to fail; and in Aguirre, the metaphor works to say that the project doomed to fail is the project of mastery and control over the globe).  Whether or not you choose to read the film metaphorically, and whether or not you are impressed by the implicit views Herzog offers on the destiny of man, this is a remarkable and stunning and hypnotic and powerful film, that cannot fail to impress the lover of ambitious cinema that aims at revealing some kind of truth rather than merely to help pass the time as an escape from the mundane.

(Unfortunately, the dvd release is less than stellar.  My copy has a few little glitches and artifacts here and there that don't dull the power of this film but make clear that this version leaves something to be desired.  The sound also seems a bit muted.

Director Werner Herzog (b. 1942) takes the viewer through the doomed allegory of crazed warrior Aguirre, played by Klaus Kinski (1926-91), who infuses the character with his piercing blue-eyed gaze and incredible dancer's stance. Like Don Quixote, another man possessed, he actually tilts.

Loosely based on the real South American conquistador and rebel, Aguirre, this film relates the well-known tale of pursuing an impossible dream: a quest for golden El Dorado. It's fleshed out against breathtaking Peru. Unforgettable scenes, akin to John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, include the climb down treacherous hills, slugging through knee-deep water, and sloshing through sucking mud.

Kinski's face bookends the opening and closing of this 100-minute film. In several scenes, Kinski holds some of the delightful and terrifying jungle creatures, his tenderness in contrast to his bloodthirsty brutality. We also get to know the cruelty and cleverness of the indigenous Indians who predicted the coming of the Golden Man but were powerless to stop him. As in real life, the characters on the journey are layered and complex.

In a curious way, the film reminded me of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales gone terribly wrong, as one man's greed and egomania echo the disastrous warring times in which Herzog grew up.

385498,5,630195517X,"Werner Herzog has been called a madman, a dreamer and a maverick of cinema. An eccentric and driven filmmaker, his drive and eccentricity often crossed the border into obsession. Not surprisingly, his films have often been seen as explorations of the depths of obsession, and his masterpiece of masterpieces, Aguirre, the Wrath of God, is no exception.

Aguirre is a fairly accessible film, considering its pedigre, and one that eschews the temporally disjointed structures and arcane avant-garde-isms more typical of earlier German art cinema (including Herzog's own previous work). Instead, Herzog relies on simple narrative filmmaking to tell a story that is on one level a chronicle of a Quixotic yet doomed quest, on a second level, a meditation on the descent into madness and death, and on yet another level, a scathing rebuke of the cultural zeitgeist of Herzog's age.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God begins with one of the most visually stunning shots in cinematic history (and ends with another), as conquistadors under the command of Gonzalo Pizzaro (brother of the conqueror of the Inca), guided by Indian slaves, pick their way through the fog down an impossibly steep mountain terrace toward the jungle below. Soon, a small force leaves this main body to scout down a river in the search of the fabled city of El Dorado.

The rest of the film follows the course of this scouting party as it floats to its inevitable doom, done in by starvation, disease, the decidedly unfriendly attentions of the natives, and, most of all, by the madness and boundless ambition of the expedition's second-in-command, Don Lope de Aguirre (the incomparable Klaus Kinski).

In telling this story, Herzog makes use of a minimalistic cinematic style in which both dialogue and action are sparsely distributed. Instead, the plot unfolds primarily through a series of visual metaphors - the descent into the jungle, the river, a fully rigged sailing vessel somehow stranded in the forest canopy - which, combined with the brilliant soundtrack by ambient music pioneers Popol Vuh, help to create the trancelike dreamscapes for which Herzog is justifiably famous.

One of the highlights of Aguirre, the Wrath of God is the simply stunning cinematography of Thomas Mauch. The fluid, languid movements of Mauch's camera mirrors to the agonizingly slow progress of the expedition (shown to particularly brilliant effect in the film's opening shots), and serves to lend an epic sensibility to a film that clocks in at a spare 94 minutes. The supersaturated colors of the jungle backgrounds become at once beautiful and suffocating - a choking, endless emerald sea, swallowing all human presence and endeavor, rendering them futile and meaningless.

Special attention should also be paid to the Klaus Kinski's performance in the title role, which is not only magnificent, but must be counted among the greatest performances in film history. For a lesser actor, the sparseness of dialogue and plotting in Herzog's largely improvised script could have presented an insurmountable obstacle, but in the hands of a master like Kinski, that very lack of dialogue and action becomes an opportunity to fill the empty space with the edges of a character created from the fragments of gesture. Kinski renders the madness of Aguirre all the more frightening by cloaking it in mystery and only allowing us to view glimpses of the beast within. Instead, we are left to intuit his insanity from subtle cues of movement and expression: his curiously bent walk; the inhuman detachment he shows in the face of the suffering and fear of his men; the way he simply materializes in front of the camera, drifting in like fog (a feat he contrived through a contorted sort of pirouette); the calculating silence into which he frequently falls. That his madness is only hinted at makes the unnervingly whispered moments of rage even more terrifying.

On the surface, Aguirre is an exploration of the romance of the Impossible Dream, yet another sign of his obsession with obsessions, perhaps the central concern of Herzog's art. On a deeper level, it is perhaps best understood as a blistering critique of the 1960s counterculture. The Enlightenment conceit of the 'noble savage' which the hippie movement adopted as its central tenet is ruthlessly dissected, and the hollowness made manifest by the Summer of Love, Altamont and the Manson Family is given concrete expression in the form of the Indians. These, far from being the peaceful sages of hippie lore, appear in Aguirre as faceless demons of fear, invisible except for their handiwork, which is no less than death itself.

Herzog's Jungle, his emblem of Nature, reinforces this critique: Herzog's Jungle is not the counterculture's garden of delights, it is Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Here, the hippies' peaceful paradise is consumed by Kipling's 'nature, red in tooth and claw.' Though the Jungle teems with life and beauty, it is in the end a cradle of madness, and the triumph of the Jungle is a meditation on the triumph of Death.

But it is in the character of Aguirre himself that Herzog's critique of the counterculture achieves its most complete form, for Don Lope de Aguirre can be fruitfully read as the film's hippie stand-in (he conveniently even sports long hair). It is Aguirre, conquistador, and ex officio, agent of civilization, who descends into the Jungle (and into madness), stripping away the last vestigial remnants of his own civilized veneer in his pursuit of the Impossible Dream of El Dorado. What emerges is, in a sense, the Natural Man. But the Natural Man is not a man at peace and harmony with other men and nature, but a man reduced to a state of madness and endless, unquenchable desire. In Aguirre, the great lie of the Enlightenment and counterculture is made manifest: divorced from any civilized impulse, he is only a savage, vicious, ruthless and subject only to his own impulses and wishes. Instead of Rousseau's Noble Savage, the Natural Man stands revealed as nothing more (or less) than Hobbes' Leviathan.",1182816000,7,6061,5.059059059059059
385499,5,630195517X,"There are some movies that reach you in ways most others don't.  ""Aguirre. the Wrath of God"" is one of those movies.  The plot and acting are certainly interesting but the amazing thing about the movie is how it was ever made in the first place.  The opening scene of an endless line of soldiers, porters, animals, etc coming single-file down a mountain path is, initially, secondary to the sheer beauty of the scenery.  As the camera stays focussed on that shot, we gradually change our focus to the long line of people trekking along steep inclines and narrow paths.  How on earth did anyone get all of these people up there to shoot this scene in the first place?  I learned from watching ""Fitzcaraldo"" that Werner Herzog is a director not afraid to shoot long takes on any given scene he deems worthwhile.  This opening shot is emblematic of what Makes ""Aguirre"" such a marvelous film.  The combination of stunning scenery, cinematography, and pristine locations makes watching this tale of MacBeth in the New World such an adventure.

As the story unfolds, the conquistadores come to the river that they will travel to find their quest; the city of gold.  Herzog gives us another one of his extended scenes of the churning white-water rapids in this forboding river.  As the shot continues, it becomes slightly out of focus with the effect of making its' chaotic appearance all the more menacing.  In another one of those ""how did he do that?"" sequences, we follow four rafts down a slightly less challenging stretch of the river.  This film looked dangerous to be a part of.  Even as the river widens into a slow-moving flood plain, we are still amazed at the limitations that the actors and crew members must be contending with to put this movie together.

As for the plot and the acting, it evolves into a tale of intrigue with the main culprit being Klaus Kinski as Aguirre.  His quest for fortune and fame leads him to abandon all moral and logical sense with the sole purpose to become ruler of his corner of the world.  The contrast between man's immorality and nature's purity serves to enhance our awareness of both.

The expedition descends deeper into depravity and greed to where we realize that there will be no happy ending.  Thus, when the movie does come to a close, it is not with a bang but with a whimper and appropriately so.  Nature has been violated but man has been subdued.",1179878400,,2402,4.6469194312796205
385500,5,630195517X,"Aguirre, the Wrath of God marks the first pairing of director Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, the legendary and tumultuous actor-director relationship that would carry over to four more films. Aguirre, the Wrath of God is frequently cited as the best of their pairings and I was lead to watch the film when I was younger by a blossoming interest in world cinema and the work of Herzog. Unfortunately, my young age and lack of taste rendered me uninterested and bored and I always remembered this film as being unique, but dull. Recently watching Herzog's documentary on Kinski My Best Fiend made me want to return to the film and revisiting it now has been an eye-opening experience.

The story is about the doomed expedition of Spanish conquistadors searching for the city of El Dorado. It's narrated by Brother Gaspar de Carvajal, whose writings we're informed by title card serve as the only record of the expedition. The first shot (one of the most talked about) shows hundreds of conquistadors walking down a mountain and it's a remarkable shot. Traveling through treacherous terrain in the jungle, Pizarro orders a small group of men to go by raft to find El Dorado. Pizarro chooses Don Pedro de Ursua to be first-in-command and Don Lope de Aguirre (Kinski) is chosen to be second-in-command. As the expedition progresses with less-than-satisfactory results, it is proposed they turn back leading Aguirre to assume command by killing its leaders and insisting they press on.

I've left much of the plot out, but plot has little to do with the film's effect. Roger Ebert described it as ""one of the great haunting visions of the cinema"" and I can't think of a more accurate way to describe it. Herzog's images bring the audience into a completely different time and place, a dreamscape with the atmosphere of a nightmare. Herzog has spoken about filming on real locations due to the ""voodoo of the location"" and Aguirre really captures that voodoo. Few films strike me as ""otherworldly"" but this is one of them and there's an almost hypnotic effect on the viewer.

You can't even begin to discuss this film without mentioning Klaus Kinski. Kinski's on-set outbursts are well-known and well-documented and being familiar with his animalistic nature I was eagerly looking forward to seeing his performance. Kinski's performance is pretty low-key, although not without moments of ferocity. Being a madman, I assume he would approach the role of a madman much differently than others and he brings a remarkable subtlety and grace to the role. Furthermore, he has one of the most fascinating faces in cinema. He can look like a brute, a wild animal and also possess a sort of distinguished beauty. His performance as Aguirre is one of the most haunting performances in cinematic history and, if you disagree, I recommend watching the end of the film again.

Popol Vuh composed the score, which is one of the most important elements of the film. It's nearly impossible to recall a scene from the film without recalling the music that went along with it. The score certainly deepens the atmosphere of the film and actually heightens the haunting imagery.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God is a beautiful film and, without a doubt, one of the best films I've ever seen. Herzog has made a film that detaches the audience from the action, giving his film a very dream-like feel and I would call this one of the great nightmare's of cinema. Aguirre is not the most accessible film, but those who fail to see the brilliance here are missing out on one of the greatest cinematic visions. It's a masterpiece that has left me completely awe-struck. It's scenes of pure beauty will likely remain in my memory for a long time.

It was even more impressive than advertised. from moment one. The opening is absolutely captivated as it thrusts you back into the timeframe the director wishes to recreate. Intensity, intensity, and more intensity is the best way to describe this film. Every time Kinski is onscreen it's impossible to notice anyone else. He absorbs our attention immediately. The peripherals--like the score, the Incan flute music, and even the cluck clucking of Aguirre's right hand man--increase the tension which is only somewhat relieved in the final sequence.

385502,5,630195517X,"""Aguirre"" drifts somewhere between the most gritty realism and the most stylized of the surreal. Painfully shot on location in the grueling jungles of South America, Herzog lingers on the scenery in such a way that the misty mountains and raging rapids start to take on a strange dream like quality. The droning minimalist musical score adds to the hazy, trance inducing atmosphere. Very real things like a horse watching the boat drift away from the shore somehow become the ""fantastic."" Much like the doomed characters of the film, the viewer also becomes lost in a fever dream where reality and fantasy blur. You to will see a distant ship nested in the tree tops and wander if it is really there or not. All the while, Herzog's eye for harsh realistic detail serves as a reminder of the film's reality.

There is a strange numb dread about the movie, one of the most peaceful and subtle descents into oblivion you can possibly hope for. It's very much like marching to the eletric chair but being to stoned to care. Even the more violent death scenes come across as being painless and gradual, so much so that many of the characters don't even seem to notice that their dead, let alone care. Just as death gradually consumes the characters, the apocalyptic climax creeps up on the viewer without them even knowing it. Commenting on a jungle sloth, the Aguirre character comments, ""this creature sleeps most of it's life away."" I wander if Herzorg is suggesting that is also true for most humans, especially the dreamers.

The story is a simple one, told visually with little dialouge. The missionary(Del Negro) spaciously narrates the more concrete aspects of story. On the surface it is simply a tale of greedy conquistadors that revolt against orders, sail down the river, and are gradually killed off by hunger,illness, natives, and each other. Kinski approaches ""Aguirre"" with a quiet, controlled intensity that makes his character far more disturbing than any ranting lunatic; letting his expressive eyes convey the scheming maddness and menace boiling under the surface. However, there are also impossibly gentle scenes that add subtle depth to the deranged character. The most noteworthy being, the warm scene where he presents a minature sloth to his daughter; the creature delicate and fragile in his large, stern hands. Oddly enough, Kinski's Aguirre is also a very inspiring leader. As absurd as the dream of El Dorado might sound, his appealing case makes it very easy to see why most of the group side with him(especially the African slave, a suprisingly well developed and played character that could have been a throw away.) Too bad it's a misguided dream built on greed. Kinski of course rules but the supporting performances are also fantastic. Del Negro stands out the most as the missionary that may be a little more sinister than he initially seems to the viewer while the doomed couple, Helena Rojo and Ruy Guerra give near silent strong faced performances that interestingly clash with the tragedy of their situation. They are sympathetic for sure, but they aren't asking for your sympathy or even your support. While none of the supporting characters are boundless with development or depth, everyone at least allowed a revealing scene or two that makes them more than just props for Herzorg's camera. It is apparent the quest is doomed from the start, but one can't help but turn away from the void their descending into, the word ""hypnotic"" is indeed a good description.",1167868800,6,3499,4.928813559322034

""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" is a fascinating tale that was told by its matchless team of creators, two madmen not unlike Aguirre himself. Full of powerful images of impressive landscapes and natural wonders, this film as many of Herzog's films explores his favorite theme - magnificent indifference of nature against the man's obsession that borders with madness.

One of the best endings ever - tragic and comical in the same time - mad and delusional man on the wrecked raft with the monkeys - and he does not see it. He lives in his own world that he created in his feverish mind.

When I watch Herzog's films I think of his words, ""If I had to climb into hell and wrestle the devil himself for one of my films, I would do it."" Each his film deserves to be wrestled for.",1152316800,3,816,4.426666666666667
385617,5,630195517X,"This film is now commonly viewed as Werner Herzog's international breakthrough. Which unfortunately is another myth that has sprung up around the film. Lauded and adored by critics and academia perhaps, the general cinema going public were and still remain unaware of Herzog's work. But it certainly is a creative breakthrough and the reasons for this, is that by Herzog standards this is a very conventional piece of story-telling. It is replete with action, conspiracy, adventure and danger and from a narrative perspective owes a good deal of debt to classic Hollywood adventure films. Where it differs is in Herzog's own unique lexicon of film language, his use of camera, editing and soundtrack combine to  give the film a documentary feel. This often works in an opposite way in Herzog's cinema as well, with his documentaries having the heightened, fantastical lucidity of a fictional narrative. The film also highlighted to a wider audience Herzog's propensity to take risks and the efforts he goes to in order to achieve the `ecstatic truth' he has sought throughout his career. In AGUIRRE this is best represented by the breathtaking opening sequence.

 This film also establishes the twin themes that have been present throughout Herzog's work since, that of colonialist expansion and the effect of western civilisation on the African continent and the exploration of dreams. In this case the dreams of AGUIRRE are negative and fuelled by a slowly burgeoning insanity. And a major delight of this film is KLAUS KINSKI'S towering performance of scheming malevolence. Rarely has an actor dominated a film quite as much.  Herzog also painstakingly presents nature as harsh, unforgiving and beyond the mere comprehension of a man, a theme he still explores successfully to this day as his recent film GRIZZLY MAN illustrates. If one can ignore the mythical tales of hardship and insanity that dog this film, it is an incredible experience that makes a fine companion piece to both Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS and Herzog's own FITZCARRALDO.

 Anchor Bay's DVD is unfortunately devoid of the type of extras we have become used to from the company. But we should be glad that they have taken of the task of re-mastering Herzog's films and bringing them to the attention of the DVD generation of film collectors. The commentary track is good value for money, Herzog remains as always fascinating listening.",1151539200,3,2408,5.114503816793893

  as an officer under a noblemans command, aguirre(kinski in the role of a lifetime) is slowly seeing that he can become rich and grab a lot of land if he can lose the nobleman leader and strike out on his own. so taking men and supplies with him he sets out to conquer this harsh unforgiven land, and loses his mind in the process. the film is remarkable as it shows us how quickly the land and maddness overtake aguirre and his men,who set out down a river looking for a city of gold! the river trip is the most unforgiven trip i have ever seen, as sickness and unseen natives slowly take their tole on the exploriers. the finale shot of aguirre giving a speach to a dead crew as he flots down the empty river is both heartbreaking and a chilling look at madness at its most unchecked!

385622,5,630195517X,"In the 16th century, an expedition of Spanish soldiers, lead by Francisco Pizarro, travels down the Amazon in search of gold. The journey becomes more perilous with every step, the Spanish and their Indian slaves rapidly falling victim to the elements. Pizarro declares that a scouting party led will move ahead, and must return within two weeks. Don Ursua will lead the party, with Don Aguirre second in command.

Werner Herzog's Aguirre, the Wrath of God plunges the viewer into the heart of madness, fully realized through the eyes of a man with a lust for power that triumphs over all else. The scouting party makes its way through an Amazon jungle teeming with billions of shades of green, which spiral into seeming eternity. Food is scarce, hostile natives are plentiful, and the Spanish are greatly outmatched. They may be settlers, but the jungle seems dizzyingly claustrophobic, natures coiled as if it may spring to life and devour every foreign element that dare trespass. Where many films use nature as a beautiful symbol for harmony, in this film, it is a WMD.

The scouting party rapidly falls apart. Aguirre (Klaus Klinski) moves with a queasy limp, with a head that seems to swivel 360 degrees, his intense eyes not possessing bright intelligence, but dark cunning. He cares not for gold, but for power, and gleefully seizes the chance to overthrow Ursua. Aguirre declares independence Spain, claiming South America as his territory, a bold claim considering the size of the scouting party. He appoints a fat, lazy bureaucrat to be his puppet king, though Aguirre finds this man to be unsatisfactory as well. Little time passes before Aguirre declares himself the new king, feverishly driving the party forward on a giant raft.

Food quickly runs out, Indian attacks intensify. The tragic excess of old Europe sticks out like a sore thumb; the party has cannon, horse, and a mobile sitting room for Aguirre's daughter, but rotten fruit for nutrition. Aguirre becomes increasingly unstable, pompously bragging about his hollow empire, ruthlessly striking down any member of his own party that utter a word of doubt. As we watch Aguirre's sanity deteriorate under the crushing weight of his failed dream, images of Adolf Hitler pounding a battle map and ordering non-existent armies into battle flood into our minds.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God paints a searing indictment of those who would forsake everyone in their vicious quest for power, and serves as a deadly warning to those who would attempt to indulge their insane fantasies. Herzog suggests that whatever mad dream a greedy villain may possess, the forces of nature will inevitably shatter it to pieces, along with those who follow. We can only hope so.",1141948800,,2727,5.013245033112582

385624,5,630195517X,"While watching  ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" I was struck with an analogy to Joseph Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"". The deeper Don Lupe de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) and his colleagues venture into the jungle in the quest for the fabled land of gold -- El Dorado, the more life around them ceases to be.

It is not so much nature and the Indians that devour them, rather it is Aguirre's greed, selfishness, pride and intolerance that leads to their un-doing. In the end, when Aguirre stands alone on a motionless raft full of monkeys and corpses, he realises he is the cause of their deaths. In recognition of his 'sins' he proclaims ""I am God's wrath"". In a vicious, paranoid-psychotic-megalomaniac way, Aguirre acts as though he were God; he is ruler and punisher.

Had Herzog intended this to be a definitive documentary on Gonzalo Pizarro's expedition, I would fault the historical accuracy of the film. However, in so much as it is an art film with a moral lesson, it is irrelevant that Pizarro actually died eight years before this story takes place and another priest, not the Dominican monk Gaspar de Carvajal, recorded a similar fate from another journey. Nevertheless, we get a feeling of what European conquest must have been like, especially when one realises Herzog pushed his actors and crew to experience it first hand.

As for photography and symbolism, Herzog's opening footage of the Spanish conquistadors, their entourage and prisoners cautiously descending along a mist enshrouded footpath in the Andes paints a dreamy, other worldliness that foreshadows their imminent downfall. As they progress deeper into the Peruvian jungle, the camera projects the impression that the actors are minute and insignificant against its immensity. Even their rusty armour appears authentic and hints of the decadence and their impending fate.

To appreciate the actors performance more, I would recommend listening to the movie in the German language, not English. The cadence and intonation of their words matches their emotions and body language better.

It is the story of a Spanish expidition gone horribly wrong when a madman, Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), commits mutiny and takes over a search for the city of El Derado.  This is the city of gold, a myth created by the native Amazon people to lure explorers into a trap.  This movie is a fascinating study of greed and power, and how delusional human beings can become when they feel they have the world's riches at their hands.  While watching the film, I realized that Francis Ford Coopola had stolen some of the images from this movie!  Coopola stole images and shots from this movie and used them 'Apocalypse Now'.  How surprising to see that some of those images in 'Apocalypse' had been long thought up before!  Nonetheless, this is a film definately not to be missed by the film fanatics.  It is quite a visionary and bone-chilling fim.  I had never even heard of it until several months ago.

After the group runs into many troubles, a spirited and largely egotistical man named Aguirre mutinies and takes control of the group, quickly becoming obsessed with discovering El Dorado for himself and becoming a god in his own right.

This movie has many fine things working for it that add up quickly to make an appealing and enthralling movie.  The on-location shooting does more than reveal the merciless world they were trying to conquer, it hems in even the camera and the action into one long act of pure claustrophobia.  Great acting creates utterly believable characters, and directing and cinematography enhance the experience.

Stranger is the writing.  Obviously, being conquistadors, these were very obsessed folk, enraptured in the idea of glory on earth (gold) and in heaven (spreading Christianity).  Herzog does not let up on their personalities, and comes at many times close to making the characters rather unbelievable.  Luckily, the few spikes towards pure nonsense are rather Absurdist in a good way, and definitely show the destructive power of the self-righteous greed of humanity, yet it all seems to be placed very realistically.  Modern day audiences will find it difficult to relate to these characters, though they can still understand them.

Either this is brilliance or just over-the-top.  I can't decide which.  I'm willing to bet it's largely a matter of opinion.

One thing is for sure: while it lasts, it's a great movie.  After it ends, though, it may be hard to come to terms with what one has just seen.

An expedition sponsored by the Spanish crown is wandering around looking for Indians to convert and, more urgently, for gold, having heard rumours of the putative guilded region of El Dorado. Some aristocratic women are among them who cannot be expected to walk so they are hauled by Indian slaves in sedan chairs over huge and precipitious mountains passes, along with heavy artillery and all sorts of other stuff. Eventually the reckon they are hopelessly lost so they send of a group of 40 or so to reconnoitre buy raft under the leadershop of Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra). His second in command is a certain Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) while the Spanish royal house is to be represented by Don Fernando de Guzman (Peter Berling). Things to not go well. Rapids and hostile Indians take their toll. After a bit Ursua decides it's time to head back to the main party. Aguirre begs to differ. He thinks they should forget the main party, carry on down the river, find El Dorado, conquer it and establish a mighty empire. He wins out, Ursua is made a prisoner and Guzman is declared to be Emperor of El Dorado. A solemn declaration is read out declaring the Spanish king dethroned and obliterated. Down the river they go, deeper and deeper into impossible wilderness still solemnly announcing to no one in particular their annexation of every inch of land.

This is a fabulous film. I first saw it at the cinema when very young and it blew me away. Seeing it again lately it is still just as good. It has a mesmerizing, dreamlike poetic feel that many arty films try for and hardly come close to so triumphantly achieving. It's a highly original story but as a film in which agents of imperialism going down a river surrounded by alien jungle wilderness and being engulfed by madness, it comes far closer to the mood and spirit of Conrad's `Heart of Darkness' than does Coppola's far more self-conscious echo of that great novel. Herzog is here at his very best and Kinski is perfect as the demented megalomaniac lead. It's dark, beautiful stuff. The closing few minutes in particular are unforgettable.

This second version lets you sit in the room as the director himself is being interviewed throughout the movie, as he watches it with you and comments about it.

From this interview we learn that most of the scenes were shot only once, that there was almost no money and very little time, that much of the action was determined nearly on the spur of the moment.  A storm or flood damaged the set overnight?  Use it as part of the story.  The director comments that composing a storyline in advance is not his style, and that it would kill the spontaneity of movie making.  Also, a video camera was stolen in order to make this movie.  The director doesn't consider it theft.  He considers it the appropriation of something needed, more or less like Jean Val Jean swiping a loaf of bread.

There are remarkable and excellent reviews of the film on this site.  Don't worry about spoiling the plot.  The plot really isn't the point.  The experience is the point.

In short, it is a German language film but it is set in South America at the time of the conquistadores.  They are searching for the city of gold, which they believe is near Macchu Picchu, where they begin.  One unit of conquistadores sails down a tributary of the Amazon River, intending to claim all the land they see as their own.  They are using Indian slaves.  They are, as we know, rapacious bastards and cruel religious fanatics utterly and insanely convinced that they know the one true god, and that the Indian people are basically worthless, to be exploited.

This unit, on its raft, is taken over by a crazy s.o.b. named Aguirre, played by Klaus Kinski, who the director explains was actually a crazy s.o.b. in real life as well.  Aguirre is an alternate Hitler, in another time and place.  He is a megalomaniac intent on ruling a vast empire, a man unbothered by conscience, a man obsessed and insane, out of touch with reality.

Aguirre is a mellow Hitler most of the time, though his crab-like sidling walk whispers to you that he is nuts.  He doesn't tend to shout, except in one memorable scene which I will describe.

There is a lady on board the raft, the wife of the appointed leader of the expedition, the wife of the man that Aguirre has mutineed against, the man who Aguirre shot and wounded.  She scolds Aguirre, warns him that she knows that he intends to do further harm to her husband, that God will punish him for that.  Aguirre doesn't reply to her.  He backs away.  A horse is in his way, on the raft.  He takes his anger out on the horse, yelling at it to get out of his way.  The horse immediately falls down, apparently as a result of being yelled at by Aguirre, though the director explains to us that the horse was tranquilized, causing it to fall at that moment.

The religious fanatics are ridiculed by the director, as well they should be.  In one scene, an Indian is handed a Bible and told that it contains the word of God.  The Indian, who obviously has never seen a book before, puts the Bible to his ear, doesn't hear the word of God, and says so.  For that bit of blasphemy, he and his wife are killed.

The religious leader of the conquistador unit lights up any time that gold is mentioned.  He gets a crazy gleam in his eye.  It's pretty funny to watch.

Perhaps my favorite moment in the film comes near the end, as Aguirre follows around a band of monkeys on his raft, picks one up, speaks to it, and tosses it.  You've got to see that.

You also have to see the scene where Kinski is fantasizing about the empire he will rule, an empire of purity, pure because it will be founded by him and his own daughter in an incestuous relationship, thereby keeping the bloodline pure.  That is a wonderful comment by the director about Hitler's vision of racial purity and Aryan supremacy.  To underscore the fact that Aguirre is nuts, as if his vision of an entire nation descending from himself and his daughter isn't enough, we have the small but relevant fact that his daughter, the future mother of his children, is already dead.

There is a lot of carnage and death in this movie, but it is handled so quietly.  When people get shot, whether by arrows or guns, they make no noise and they seem to feel no pain.  I've never seen anything like it.  One fellow, a black slave, notices that an arrow has just pierced his leg, and just tells himself that it is all an illusion.  Another, having just been run through by an arrow the length of a spear, simply comments that long arrows seem to be coming into fashion, and then he dies.

To put this film in perspective, let's explore what it would have been like had it been made in Hollywood.  Hollywood would have given us a hero to root for, a victory to cheer for, and a romantic interest for the leading character.  I'm so sick of it.

So many movies can be summed up with the exact same description.  The hero faces overwhelming odds.  He is almost defeated, but he eventually overcomes the enemy.  He also gets the girl.  The end.  Whenever I see that plot redone I feel like saying ""what a piece of garbage"".

Aguirre is not garbage.  It is an original work of art.  Thank you for that.

Many moviegoers wouldn't enjoy this movie.  It is too slow-paced to keep their attention.  It isn't the cinematic equivalent of soda pop.  But I enjoyed it, and since you are on this site, you probably would appreciate it too.",1118275200,12,5496,4.407960199004975

I was paralyzed for hours after watching it the first time. This is the raw stuff of humanity. Think 'Heart of Darkness' or The Sound and the Fury or 'King Lear'. Yes, it's that good. I assure you. Ecce homo.

Watch it now, especially if you would say you're of 'philosophic' mindset.

By the way, this IS presented in the original aspect ratio. Herzog made his first few movies with a handheld camera he had stolen in Germany, this being one of them.",1118016000,3,629,4.413793103448276

Director Werner Herzog does not beat you over the head with the theme of unbridled arrogance and madness in a place where rules of civility don't apply.  He lets the story and situations develope until they reach their inevitable conclusion.  Klaus Kinski, as Aguirre, is with Herzog every step of the way.  He does not telegraph his character's megalomania right away.  It slowly grows as the group of explorers under his charge wither away and the true nature of his insanity is revealed through voiceover in the end.  Other reviewers have mentioned the parallels between the conquerors of the New World and Nazism.  What accentuates this connection is watching ""Aguirre"" with the German language track instead of the optional English language track.  At one point somebody refers to the nobleman in Aguirre's party as ""Der Fuhrer"".  By all means opt for the German track for a more rewarding experience.

Are these the children of Naziism (and a part of a totalitartian mind-set that will echo down through history) or, are they just misguided pawns? Are they just storm troopers in search of gold and El Dorado, or just fools? These are the questions Herzog throws at us.
Klaus Kinski gives one of the great perfomances in film history as the deluded mad assassin of Spain's hubris.
The opening scene remains one of cinema's great set pieces.

One is appalled, yet fascinated, by the descent into madness & self-destruction, not by one madman but by the entire expedition --- clearly Herzog's commentary on Germany's embrace of Naziism, but unfortunately an all too relevant reflection on many current events.

Really, who cares if the film is grainy & the editing a little choppy?  If you want slick production values, go watch a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  The obvious shoestring budget has little impact on Herzog's ability to mesmerize the viewer, right from the opening scene down to a monkey-infested raft floating into oblivion.

One wonders what Herzog might have done with a bigger budget.  The historical Lope de Aguirre was even more appalling than Herzog's version, cutting a swath of destruction & mass slaughter of Indians in South America before he was captured and shot for treason.  Herzog could have been more gruesome than he was, but there is no real need.  Watching a group of men (who should have known better) head down a path towards obvious destruction because of greed and a hunger for power is pretty compelling stuff on its own.

Aguirre appears little more than a swaggering drunk with no purpose or motivation.  The touted 'descent to madness' is little more than a few idle comments in the last 5 minutes of the movie as the story line never finds closure.

385925,5,630195517X,"Herzog's loose adaptation on Don Lope de Aguirre, a Spanish Basque conquistador who explored the Amazon basin in search of the legendary city of El Dorado during the 16th century and later rebelled against King Phillip of Spain. Filmed on location near Machu Pichu with locals as extras, the merit of the film goes into the direction and the acting as opposed to film quality. Produced and directed on a college-level budget (Herzog actually had to steal his alma mater's filming equipment for this film), the film quality is somewhat coarse and similar to cameras and film used for documentary footage. Another drawback is that it's only in mono and has no dolby or other stereo sound options. Despite these technical limitations, Herzog's choices of scenes, pacing, and editing, along with Kinski's superb acting, result in a brilliant film. The theme of unchecked ambition leading to madness and eventual oblivion is beautifully carried by the plot's depiction of how the overconfident explorers, led by their greed, drift, fight, and decay ever further into the wilderness. With King and Church far away, Aguire's promise of gold and power leads a small group of deluded followers to mutiny and eventual oblivion. As their voyage progresses and the further the characters are removed from any shred of civilization, madness seems strangely sane and the unending lust for power somehow satiable. Also visible are the thematic parallels with the megalomanic rise and inevitable destruction of Nazi Germany. The synthesized droning background music adds to the sense of delirium and to the film's dreamlike qualities.  Francis Ford Copolla gives homage to Herzog's direction in this film and the inspiration it gave him in his own direction of 'Apocalypse Now.'",1090540800,2,1762,5.204225352112676
385926,5,630195517X,"I am new to Warner Herzog, and ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" is the 2nd of his films that I have seen. Like many directors with strong artistic visions, I have found his style a bit hard to adapt to but I am appreciating it more and more.  The grotesque colors he uses are particularly noteworthy, lending a feeling of unreality that contrasts with the naked realism of his films. The visual images are haunting, and linger after the film is over.  The Wrath of God and 400 little monkeys...
""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" is by no means an easy film to get into.  The characters are brutal and uninviting, and it is impossible to sympathize with their plight, the conquest of the native peoples. Like the river they travel on, the armored conquistadors move slowly but relentlessly forward, pieces of their humanity and sanity falling off along the way.  At one scene in particular, the soldiers dispassionately watch their fellows trapped in a river eddy, discussion whether or not they should attempt a rescue with no more urgency or care than wondering if they should have coffee or tea.  The peruvian natives are equally unsympathetic, picking off the soldiers slowly from the jungle, invisible and dangerous. One can see the influence it must have had on""Apocalypse Now.""
People call this film dreamlike, and that maybe, but it is also brutally realistic, dirty and harsh.  There is a sense that this is exactly what it would be like.  There is a definite sense that animals were harmed during the filming, and that people were harmed as well.  No camera trickery or artistic license is taken.  All deaths are ignoble. Klaus Kinski, as Aguirre,  is an uncharismatic Richard III,. slightly hunchbacked and ugly, leading his followers down a mad path that can have only one destination.",1089417600,3,1785,4.803921568627451
385927,5,630195517X,"On the eastern slopes of the Andes during the Spanish expedition , Gonzalo Pizarro urges his men to continue through the thick Amazon forests despite the dangers within the dark and humid jungle.  The tale of Pizarro's venture begins with an ominous warning as it is revealed to the audience that the only surviving evidence of the expedition is a journal kept by Brother Gaspar de Carvajal, a monk who travels to spread the gospel of Christianity.  This bleak foreshadowing induces an inching uneasiness into the mind of the audience.  This is enhanced by further looming incidents such as native slaves dying like flies from simple colds and food shortage.  The low supply of food leads to a decision to split the group where one group should return for provisions and the other should continue searching for a gold shimmering city.  This tale then follows the ill-fated who continue the journey for the legendary city as they are drawn deeper into the cruel world of the Amazon.  Deaths of several men forebode the grim future of the expedition, which the leadership wants to call off and return to the safety of civilization.  However, Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), a high ranking soldier, commands a rise against the leadership based on a proud vision of greatness and worldly riches beyond imagination that drives him to thrust deeper into the unexplored rainforest.  Aguirre's vision draws the expedition into a personal realm of madness and destruction, which leads to only one certain fate.

Aguirre: The Wrath of God has a lingering effect on the audience as the eerie atmosphere created by Herzog persists from the initial shot to the final scene.  There are several components that generate this bizarre ambiance of the story such as cinematography, idiosyncrasies, mise-en-scene, and performances by the cast.  The cinematography is simple and sometimes documentary-like, which produces a real feeling.  This real feeling together with the uncanny knowledge of the unavoidable doom enhances the extraordinary atmosphere of the venture.  The complete portrait of the character Aguirre by Klaus Kinski is nothing but spectacular.  Herzog's choice of mise-en-scene is delicately chosen as all the items had to be transported by the expedition.  Each item within each frame displays a significant symbolism such as the horse and raft, which adds new layers to the unnatural atmosphere.  Lastly, the performances by the cast are outstanding as it is not the dialogue that drives the story forward, but the visual manifestation of their being that elevates the outlandish impression of each scene.  When Herzog combined all the aspects of film-making in Aguirre: The Wrath of God he left the world a brilliantly eerie cinematic experience that will leave several notions in reflecting minds.",1085702400,,2792,5.182628062360802
385928,5,630195517X,"Wraith of God was actually made in 1972 in German and got its US debut in 1977 and provided Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) with a vision. The film is pure art through and through using the Amazon River as a backdrop for the epic tale of Spanish conquistadors finding themselves abandoned in South America on a quest to find the legendary city of gold `El Dorado'. Set a few decades after the Inca Empire has fallen in the 16th century, these troops of Spanish explorers have been selected by the head explorer for the region, and founder of Mexico - Pizarro, to find the lost gold. Within a few days of being on the Amazon the conquistadors are split on the rapids. Soon there is a mutiny, murder, revenge and betrayal as the dreams of vast wealth and power drive all of them to their doom.
The combination of Kinski and Herzog is electric. Here, on a shoe-string budget, they make mountains out of nothing as Tarkovsky did on `Stalker'. The costumes and sets are all obviously mostly made by the actors and whatever film crew that would actually risk hanging around Herzog and Kinski for the gung-ho shoot. This is kino-art's rendition of Hearts of Darkness. The actual suffering of the film crew (and some cruelty to animals - several horse falling scenes, the pillaging of a village with an attack on pigs and a monkey being thrown aside) is clearly visible in the narrative which borders on extreme adlibbing most of the time as well as hard labour (moving a cannon on a small wagon around the jungle, building rafts with a toilet on board and living off the land). The improvisation though is classic in every sense of the word making Herzog and Kinski instant important additions to the world of high profile art film makers. The cinematography is spot on. The majority of it is hand-held but the images of the jungle are striking and the final shots of the circling raft are sublime. Seeing Kinski chasing monkeys around the raft is also some of the most memorising and breathtakingly remarkable scenes in cinema. The film is one of the most unusual you have ever seen and becomes psychotic towards the final stages showing the craziness of our characters search for the gold - a reflection of the exertions of the crew and actors. Kinski is outstanding as the deranged Don Lope de Aguirre who trying to follow in Pizarro's footsteps even manages to take his family into hell with him. There is an excellent plot element involving a mock trial with a monk as a judge and the crowning of a pseudo-king that will have you in disbelief. The film is so lucidly insane that it will captivate you within the first few minutes. By the time the credits role you will have experienced an epic completed with a few actors, a raft, some animals and natives and yet have witness something as grand and epic as `Spartacus'. Herzog is a crazed genius and the world is his strange colloid laboratory.
`Aguirre' is up there with the ranks of `Andre Rublev' and `Apocalypse Now' however Kinski and Herzog did go one better when they made `Fitzcarraldo'(they tow a steam ship up a mountain... really!). The aspect ratio of this film is 1.37:1 meaning that it is not in widescreen or letterbox, but it was originally filmed as a square almost (fitting television perfectly). The transfer is extremely good although I believe that this is not a new transfer and was probably encoded from a very good master video tape (Beta SP) for German television broadcast and not from a 35mm film print. No one is complaining though because the quality is extremely good. The extras (documentaries, commentaries) are a must. By the way you can get the Kinski/Herzog box set of 6 films for a few quid extra than this stand alone DVD. Go look for it.",1085356800,5,3724,4.626888217522659

Herzog has always been a high risk director. He liked to walk in the knife's edge in every film he made in those years.
But what Herzog got with  this work fullfilled with superb cinematography, edition, casting, script, was something unbelievable.
In fact if you analyze carefully like me , that I 've seen all his following works, it's useless to state this is the masterpiece of Herzog, even Fitzcarraldo, filmed also with Kinski years after.
The powerful script with the Amazonas river as natural frame, the huge realism in that overpower sequence in the river with those men who are caught in circles night and day, that amazing answer who gives the priest as request to Don Pedr de Ursua when he repplies: You'll know that the church has been always with the power,  such answer in the midle of the jungle, the trip around the river and the progressive growing of emotional euphoria, the madness, the sense of gretaness in the midle of nowhere, the slow decay of the reality and the final fall with monkees as his loyal servants, the work of camera , makes that film sublime, unique and one of the most supreme examples of how to make a film now and ever.
If you stiil haven't seen this movie, don't waste just any minute of your time and buy it. You'll see like me at least twenty five times and will get always something new, so typical of the masterpieces.

The images in the opening scenes of the conquistadors - incongruously armored and overburdened for their trek, descending the rugged Amazon mountains and staggering clumsily with a large cannon and a sedan chair through dense rainforest - are nothing short of arresting.  Their glazed facial expressions speak volumes about the Sisyphean absurdity and futility of their struggle to reach El Dorado.  When Herzog's narrator laments, ""The Indians we enslaved in the mountains are a mistake.  The change in climate is killing them like flies.  And we have no time even to give them a Christian burial."", the stage is set for a brutal, tragic outcome.  Under the sway of Kinski's mad Aguirre, the Christian sensibilities of the conquistadors quickly devolve into barbarism.  Popol Vuh's soundtrack is a perfect complement - at once haunting, brooding, and mesmerizing (somewhat ironically, Popol Vuh is also the name of the sacred Mayan Book of Creation).

First, the film remains strong thirty odd years later.  Secondly, it's worth buying just to hear the director's commentary.  Who, for instance, knew that Herzog wrote the script in two and half days on a soccer tour, and would have been finished a little quicker had his drunken goalkeeper not vomited over his manuscript?  If that's where good movies come from, bring on the beer.  The film has many strengths.  Shot entirely with one camera, it gives off a sense of realism and intimacy that epics can only strive for.  Herzog has taken many liberties with the story of Lope de Aguirre, but it's simply not important.  What you do get is an inspired vision of meglomania and delusion, transmitted in small visual details that show how powerful film can be in the right hands.  A boat stuck fifty feet up in a tree, a group of chattering monkeys boarding the doomed raft, an outhouse poised above the running waters.

386105,4,630195517X,"AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD - Werner Herzog
Just do a google for this film and you will find it on a lot of respected top ten's and endless reams have been written on the insane level of perseverance that Herzog demanded of himself and his crew in the making. The plot, as it may be, follows the path of a 16th century Spaniard expedition into the South American jungle in search of the fabled El Dorado (city of gold). Any number of parallels have been drawn between the story of the expedition and the actual shooting of the film for which Herzog herded a crew of 500 into unexplored wilderness, facing similar difficult conditions, including allegedly the possibility of starvation. The extent of this is evident right from the first take which shows a train of men and animals moving down a narrow mountain trail, a majestic fog swirling in the background. The film is shot with cameras normally used for documentaries, necessitated, I suppose, by the need for extreme flexibility in their handling, since quite a few shots appear to be taken from precarious angles, including a shaky raft in the river rapids. Along with the use of natural sound, it creates a credible documentary-esque ambience.
This party is an arm of the main Spanish conquest led by Pizarro, delegated to ascertain the existence of El Dorado and return immediately to the mainstream. It is led by Don Pedro de Ursua with Aguirre as second-in-command. After seeing no signs of El Dorado in the period allotted to them, Ursua decides to return to Pizarro, but Aguirre has other ideas. He instigates the men into mutiny and wounds Ursua. Naming the burly champion Fernando de Guzman Emperor of El Dorado, he exhorts the party into casting off their allegiance to the Spanish crown and joining him in the quest for the new land. Herzog's favorite actor Klaus Kinski plays Aguirre as a handicapped yet arrogant figure determined to crush the forest into submission and establish his own dominion. The men accept his will giving in to fear for their lives and greed for the gold, thus embarking on a quest that will eventually cost them their lives and their sanity. The film moves throughout in a purposely leisured step, mimicking the pace of the raft traversing still water. All around the forest (and its inhabitants) appears to be draw them into its trap, quietly mocking all their attempts to subdue it until they are done in by their own foolhardiness, leaving only Aguirre with his long-unhinged claims of coming down on the land like the Wrath of God.
This film has a veritable haunting quality in its visuals and the concluding scene showing Aguirre stranded on the ravaged raft with only a pack of (Death's Head) monkeys as audience to his raving is one of cinema's memorable moments. On the negative side most of the characters other than Aguirre are, in my opinion, weakly developed, even nondescript, and take significantly away from the film's emotional strength. Attempts to infuse a fatalistic humor (like a soldier who falls mouthing ""So long arrows have come into fashion"", and the head that finishes its last word after being severed) come off badly. At certain moments the film even struck me as an aesthetic non-gory ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but taking into account its many strengths, this is a fine and even memorable effort from the much-admired Herzog.",1069632000,2,3343,4.835951134380454
386106,5,630195517X,"The off screen conflicts between German director Werner Herzog and volatile thespian Klaus Kinski during their many cinematic collaborations reached such epic levels that Herzog eventually made a documentary recording the details of this relationship. It isn't difficult to imagine that Kinski would be such a taxing individual when one looks at his film work, and it isn't surprising in the least that many of his roles dealt with men teetering on the brink of insanity. Kinski truly looks the part, with his crazy stare and unkempt hair swirling about his head. This actor went on to work in numerous low budget films before his death in 1991, but his films made with Herzog stand as a testament to greatness. The first of these collaborations is this film, 1973's ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" with subsequent projects appearing through the 1970s and 1980s. All told, Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog made five films together: ""Aguirre,"" ""Fitzcarraldo,"" ""Cobra Verde,"" ""Woyzeck,"" and ""Nosferatu."" I can't speak for three of these films because I haven't seen them, but ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Aguirre"" are spectacular achievements. If Herzog had never made any other films than these two, people would still consider him a great filmmaker. It's a darn shame more movie viewers don't know anything about Herzog's pictures.
The plot of ""Aguirre"" is relatively simple. It's the sixteenth century, and Spain continues its conquest of South America. In its search for gold, conquistadors under the command of Pizarro set out to find the fabled El Dorado, the city of gold. The Spanish set forth with 1100 men and numerous Indian slaves, but rough rainforest conditions soon undermine the expedition. Before quashing the mission, Pizarro orders his men to break up into groups and continue down a river for a few days. If these groups of men find nothing, they are to return and the entire contingent will go back to ""civilization."" One of these smaller expeditions sets out under the command of a Spanish nobleman named Don Pedro de Ursua, along with Don Lope de Aguirre in the role of second in command. Toting along a priest in case the expedition needs to bring salvation to the natives, the men head off to their destiny. Problems soon emerge: traveling down a river in the rainforest isn't easy, and soon death and destruction rear its ugly head. When the time arrives to head back to Pizarro, Aguirre orchestrates a coup against Ursua in order to continue the quest. What follow is a rapid descent into madness, as the conquistadors elect one of the noblemen Emperor of El Dorado and run into one conflict after another with the local populations. Supplies run low, murder and intrigue abound, and famine follow in rapid succession. Aguirre ignores it all, pushing forward as his delusions of grandeur reach undreamt of heights.
So many elements of this film work that it's tough to outline all of them. Herzog's mania for realism led him to essentially launch a genuine expedition. Those soldiers trudging through the muck, carrying a cannon down a mountain, and sailing in a rickety raft are really doing it under those grueling conditions. If you think this isn't real, remember that this director hauled an actual steamship over a mountain in ""Fitzcarraldo."" Perhaps it's no surprise that Kinski went nuts a few times during his projects with Herzog; I too might have cracked under these types of conditions. Along with the director's hyperrealism, the cinematography of the South American rainforests along with glimpses of local natives simply arrests the eye in virtually every scene. The haunting yet beautiful soundtrack by Herzog favorite Popol Vuh sounds better than the music they did for ""Fitzcarraldo"" a few years later. ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" isn't one of the best films I have seen recently; it's one of the best films I have EVER seen.
Madness and the pursuit of myth dominate the film, but I also noticed a few other ideas threading their way through the movie. The Catholic priest is really an intriguing character throughout the mission. Herzog shows the Church's complicity and hypocrisy in the European campaigns in South America through this man's actions. The priest carries a sword and helps aim the cannon when Aguirre and his men raid a local village. Moreover, when a native stomps on a Bible during a failed conversion attempt, the good father orders the killing of the Indian and then promptly performs last rites over his bleeding corpse. ""Aguirre"" captures perfectly the moral ambiguity of missionary efforts among non-Christian populations during the age of discovery. Another element in the film concerns the attempts of Aguirre and his men to impose European political and social concepts in the harsh environment of the rainforest. The power plays, political intrigues, and the assassinations of various conquistadors mirror exactly European politics of the time. Jockeying for power is one thing, but doing so in the midst of dangerous rainforest miles from any form of civilization results in nothing but grief. Perhaps the madness of Aguirre is meant to represent in microcosm the madness of European ideas regarding subjugation and genocide.
The DVD version contains an excellent transfer of the film along with bios of Herzog and Kinski, trailers for the film, and a commentary by Werner Herzog. I thoroughly enjoyed the effort Herzog and Kinski put into the project and you will, too, if you give this one a chance.

386108,4,630195517X,"That's right!  Although set in the 16th century, this moody and often frightening film is, in my opinion, a meditation on recent history.  Using the metaphor of the journey of a small band of conquistadors through Amazonia, in defiance of the orders of their leader, Pizarro, Werner Herzog has created a parable about the descent of so many contemporary (as of the date of the film) countries into totalitarian insanity.  At the beginning, the journey is about the hunt for gold and the discovery of new places.  Once the fatal decision to disobey orders has been taken the descent into insanity picks up speed.  As Aguirre replaces Don Pedro Usura all pretence at sanity and purpose fall away and the journey becomes a journey against all reason.  Any bizarre action ordered by Aguirre is either joyfully complied with or, if opposed, results in death or expulsion from the group (resulting in death).  Given the historic situation from which Herzog emerged, it is not too much of a stretch, I think, to see this film as a meditation on the rise of Adolph Hitler and the subversion into incomprehensible group insanity of an entire nation.
As a pure piece of cinema, the film contains some of the most nightmare images I have ever seen.  It's not easy to watch, even though it exerts an incredible hypnotic pull.  Some of the images are intensely beautiful and the final image, of the completely mad Aguirre, drifting down the river on a raft, surrounded by the corpses of the last remaining members of the group (including the corpse of his own daughter) and by troops of monkeys, is a haunting Gotterdammerung.",1045267200,2,1613,4.794223826714801
386109,5,630195517X,"I had all but forgotten this film until my best friend from Montreal asked me to track it down: it was all sold out in Quebec, where they love art-house films.
This film is majestic to say the least and when I first watched it over 20 years ago, I admit I cried for the sheer beauty of it all.  Herzog is brilliant in that he not so much creates a world (the jungle is already there to be filmed in it's oppressive and lush glory) but draws you effectively into the mythical, elusive search for El Dorado gold in the 16th century.  The journey is laborious and painful to watch and the film evokes a strong emotional response in almost everyone who views it.  You've only to see Fitzcarraldo to appreciate what it must have taken to get this on film.
I've just ordered Aguirre and can't wait to see it again - it is rarely on TV.  This will be a treat for all serious film lovers as the music is beautifully haunting if I remember correctly, and Klaus Kinski is riveting in his mad quest.  For years after I first saw it, I held no other actor in such high esteem until I saw Anthony Hopkins in ""Remains of the Day"".  I cannot recommend this film (Aguirre)highly enough.",1041292800,,1170,4.271493212669683
386110,5,630195517X,"Klaus Kinski stars in this journey to madness, as Aguirre, a renegade leader of a Spanish party searching the jungles of the Amazon for the mythological city of gold El Dorado. Aguirre is off the deep end, and will kill to get what he wants. He forces his crew to build rafts, and continue to pursue forward, even with no sign of a positive end. They have to fight off native Indians, they even run into a village of cannibals. Aguirre does not just want the city of gold; he wants to conquer the whole continent. As more and more men die, it doesn't look like his dreams will come true.
This film is brilliantly directed by Werner Herzog, displaying poetically the beauty of nature, and its amoral silence, as the Spanish crew go insane searching for gold, power and fame. The acting is wonderful, and we can see Aguirre slowly crawl deeper and deeper into a haunted prison in his mind. The crew display they're fear and surrender to his command perfectly. The camera is put high above the mountains showing their decent; on rafts as they travel through rapids; and into the dark jungle as an execution takes place.

The film is a 16th century ""Apocolypse Now"" portraying a mutiny among a small party of Pizarro's men in search of  El Dorado, The City of Gold.  Kinski is breathtaking as Aguirre, and Director Herzog lets it all happen.
  Perhaps the most contentious issue about this film regards the aspect ratio.  Many people, myself included, erroneously assumed that Anchor Bay had released a full frame (non widescreen) edition which certainly would have been insulting. This is not the case--the film was not shot in ""widescreen"" so you are seeing it as Herzog and cinematographer intended (1.33:1).

386212,4,630195517X,"Advance notice: You'll need to be a hard core film nut for this one. Superficially, it's a very tough hour and a half to get through - it's in German, there's not much dialogue, it's roughly edited, there's no real story and most of the actors don't really act.
However, this is genuine, German Art-House Cinema, and most of the above goes with the territory. Art house buffs are like hi-fi buffs: in the world of haute-cinema, less is most definitely more. So approach Aguirre as if it were one of those twenty grand stereos with only an on/off switch and a volume knob. It might not look like much, but boy it delivers.
Werner Herzog has a gift for a haunting scene, and they don't come much spookier than Aguirre's opener, a snaking line of conquistadors winding down the side of a steaming, dripping Andean cliff, complete with horses, canons and sedan chairs. As is Herzog's wont, they filmed this on location; no sneaky studio shots or plastic artillery here, thank you very much. Real canons. Mind you, this time the cast got off lightly: in Fitzcarraldo, Herzog's other South American epic, it was a full sized paddle steamer that got the up and over treatment.
The descent into the abyss is symoblic, too - the film is all about the Fall of Man - in the biblical sense - and the falling apart of a man in the psychiatric one. The vibe is definitely somewhere between Lord of the Flies and Apocalypse Now, with a dash of King Lear. In this aspect, the film is totally carried by the electric performance of Klaus Kinki, whose portayal of Aguirre is the essence of the swaggering unhinged.
Where Fitzcarraldo goes on for nearly three hours before ending without warning, Aguirre pulls off the same stunt in half the time - but as narrative satisfaction is not high on Herzog's list of cinematic objectives, you can't really mark the film down for this. Well, maybe a bit: Herzog is so uninterested in action that he frequently welches on it altogether; you frequently see a arrow fly, and cut to a new scene with a man lying dead with an arrow in his neck. This is difficult to get used to, and it plays with the continuity of the film: from time to time the editing is so disjointed it is difficult to piece together cause and effect. This struck me as a mark of slight laziness: odd in a director who is so unlazy as to make a film as painstakingly re-enacted as this.

""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" is a fabulous film in every respect. This is probably Warner Herzog's greatest film and a real gem of a historically-styled adventure movie. We were long overdue for a great Spanish conquistador movie.
The DVD has a nice, clean picture, with just a tad bit of grain. There are two German language soundtracks with English subtitles: one in 5.1 Surround and one in Dolby Stereo. There is also an English speaking soundtrack in Dolby as well.
Kinski is fabulous here! If you're a Klaus Kinski fan, this is the arch-typical performance that you've got to own of his. This is the best, most furious, most derranged role of Kinski's career and he is perfect in the role! There probably has never been a madder, more insanely-driven autocrat portrayed on film as this.

The DVD transfer is fresh and makes the jungle scenes come to life with  panoramic breathtaking views that are incredible. The opening sequence where the Spanish soldiers and their ""slaves"" is a perfect example of the sheer majesty as the camera slowly pulls out revealing a deep, nearly vertical mountain the crew is descending, it is nothing short of spectacular. The story itself is based upon the legendary Spanish quest for the lost city of gold El Dorado. The story reveals the insatiabale thirst for gold that corrupts the half brother of Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizzaro, Gonzalo Pizzaro, to rebel and take control of the crew in the most brutal fashion stopping at absolutely nothing, killing all who resist. His own greed  is matched only by his desire to find the lost fabled city at any cost. Klaus Kinski is superb as the bad guy who got too greedy for even his own good. He eventually finds himself going insane drifting down river with a crew of monkeys still looking for El Dorado. Following the exploits of Kinski and his reluctant crew fight off the natives and their phanthom poison darts is followed by one tragic death after another. You know you are in trouble going down the river when the Spanish crew asks what are they saying  and the Indian translator says "" they say it is  floating meat.""  Hungry cannibals are everywhere, fatigued and dejected Spanish crew  are dwindling and Klaus Kinski is meaner and crazier as the movie progresses .

386325,5,630195517X,"Werner Herzog was thirty years old when this film was released. So, while in his twenties, he decided it would be right to film the story of Aguirre, who plunged a cohort of men to their almost certain deaths in the depths of the Amazon in quest of a fame and fortune that was almost certainly illusory.  Filmed in the most trying of locations and starring an actor of legendary obstinancy and unpredictability, 'Aguirre' stands as a work underpinned by the most uplifting optimism.  To make such a work of art would require a drive and vision on a par with that of Aguirre himself.  The story itself builds and builds, until one feels that the quest is one affronting the gods themselves, so that what might strike as ridiculous and arrogant to begin with, begins to resonate with universal and unnerving implication by journey's end.  Herzog allows chance to invade the production of his film often with magical results (the final images being one such instance).  Technically there are flaws, the soundtrack and the early pacing in particular not doing justice to the overall conception, and furthermore the digital transfer is less than ideal, but this remains a truly awesome filmic experience worth a hundred formulaic Hollywood productions at the barest reckoning.

The new German cinema of the 70s and 80s was particularly fascinating for me as a student of the language and culture.  But at the time, I was simply excited at the prospect of seeing interesting films in a language that I was only beginning to master.  I scarcely recogized ""Aguirre"" for the visionary masterpiece that it was.  The insane lust for power at all costs seemed like a particularly appropriate theme for treatment by  German filmmakers.  I failed to see that there was so much more.
But now, seeing it almost thirty years after the film's release, I am utterly astonished at its beauty and depth.  It goes so much further beyond the pat themes one might at first attribute to it.  Yes, of course, it's about madness and lust for power, and maybe about man's place in the universe as well.  But, as other reviewers have noted, the true source of this film's power is its dreamlike imagery.  Cinema, it's been said, speaks in the language of dreams, but only seldom do filmmakers prove that they truly know that language.  Werner Herzog has mastered that language, as well or better than anyone.",991094400,2,1371,4.619834710743802
386448,5,630195517X,"The story is familiar to anyone who has seen Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or the countless stories inspired by Frank Norris' McTeague: a group of adventurers goes looking for treasure in a hostile wilderness.  One by one, they succumb to power-mad fantasies and kill each other, until there is only one left.  He is mad by the end - stark, raving mad. Maybe he has the gold, maybe he doesn't.  But he's far from home in every sense.  Even if he could get back to civilization, he has snapped, broken from the reality of his former life.  He is shattered. Aguirre, The Wrath of God presents a variation of this story, but one rooted in history.
The Fred C. Dobbs character is the titular Aguirre, played to eerie perfection by Klaus Kinski.  He is part of a 16th-century Spanish expedition to the Amazon River basin looking for El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.  The first time I saw this film, I could guess where the story was inexorably leading.  What I was not prepared for was the extraordinary power of its images, performances, and ideas.
Stanley Kubrick once said that if you do your job well as a director, then it almost doesn't matter how you shoot a scene.  Where you plant the camera, in other words, becomes less important than what is going on in front of it. Werner Herzog proves that point with every dream he commits to celluloid.
One would think, for example, that a hand-held camera would seem jarring, out of place in the 16th-century.  Historical dramas tend toward tripods, dolly and track, diffusion filters, and lush beauty lighting.  But most of Aguirre, The Wrath of God is shot like a documentary - without affectation; searching for the shot and stumbling upon it.  The camera - and therefore the viewer - becomes a participant in the story.  The result is a series of arresting, yet organic images:  a long line of European aristocrats and their native-born slaves traveling a narrow, misty trail in the side of a steep mountain; a raft full of doomed conquistadors helplessly drawn into an eddy near some rapids on the Amazon; a woman in a sumptuous gown drifting into the jungle in stately silence, never to be seen again; Aguirre alone on a raft full of corpses, expounding on his plans for conquest to an audience of a hundred chattering monkeys.  These images, and more, burn themselves into the mind.  That Werner Herzog achieves them with such apparent artlessness is astounding.
Aguirre, The Wrath of God is ultimately a brutally simple film.  Some of its least-adorned scenes reach more deeply than the most technically dazzling set pieces by the likes of Hitchcock, Welles, or DePalma.  Young film-makers would do well to take heed.",989712000,13,2674,4.726293103448276
386449,5,630195517X,"An involving contemplation of the human condition, ""Aguirre, Wrath of God,"" directed by Werner Herzog, is a pensive meditation on the nature of the species, an emotionally engrossing film that is visually stunning (it was filmed on location in the Amazon), insightful and imaginatively presented.  The story begins in 1560, with Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) and his army of conquistadors traversing the Andes in search of wealth, as in the wake of the conquest of the Incas some years before, the Indians began circulating stories of the legendary City of El Dorado, which purportedly held riches beyond measure.  When they reach an impasse, however, Pizarro commands forty men to continue on down the river by raft, to seek out any Christian civilization that may be of help or able to lead them to their destination.  He places Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) in charge, with Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his second in command, giving them one week, after which time if they have not returned, Pizarro and the rest will go back the way they came.  Among the forty chosen to go on, are Ursua's wife, Inez (Helena Rojo), and Aguirre's fifteen-year-old daughter, Flores (Cecilia Rivera).  But when this leg of the expedition goes awry as well, Ursua issues orders that they are to return to Pizarro; Aguirre takes exception to this, however, and rallies the men against Ursua, telling them to consider Cortes, who disobeyed when ordered back, and then went on to conquer Mexico.  What the men do not realize at the time, is that Aguirre is a delusional madman with an agenda of his own, that actually has little to do with the acquisition of wealth, but everything to do with what he perceives to be his destiny as the ""Wrath of God.""
 Herzog has crafted an absolutely mesmerizing film that is innovative and transporting.  He permeates the story with a hypnotic, ethereal atmosphere that draws you into this world, and allows you to experience the hardships of the river and the nearly insurmountable obstacles of the Peruvian Rain Forests and the mountains.  He creates that sense of being in a dream, where nothing is real, all of which is enhanced by the deliberate pace Herzog sets, as well as the haunting score that intensifies Aguirre's descent into madness.  There are a number of truly memorable scenes, the most brilliant of which frame the story:  The opening takes you along with Pizarro and his men as they negotiate the treacherous mountain paths, plodding slowly through mud and mist against all odds.  It's an extended scene that allows the viewer to assimilate the full import of what is transpiring, and with it, Herzog is letting you know what to expect from the rest of the film.  It's a breathtaking beginning, rivaled only by the final scene, in which the camera endlessly circles Aguirre as he stands alone on a raft in the middle of the river, expounding his delusions of claiming lands and the conquests that lie ahead still, surrounded by scampering monkeys and an aura of doom.
 Kinski, with his natural, haunted expression and the chilling depth of his eyes, is perfectly cast as Aguirre.  He captures the very essence of a man whose soul is damned, yet remains adamant in his quest to fulfill what he deems to be his own destiny.  Cloaked in armor, his long hair straggling out from beneath his helmet, he exhibits a singular countenance, infused with menace and an attitude of invincibility.  It's a powerful performance that underscores the impact of the contrast between the strength of his misguided and paranoid character, and the folly of his actions.  That he is unbalanced is obvious fairly early on in the film, and because of that, coupled with his determination, you are quickly able to discern the probable outcome of the story.  And it's disturbing, watching and knowing the fate that awaits these people with whom you've become involved, while at the same time, you're somewhat numbed to it all by the wistful state of being into which you have been so subtly lulled by Herzog along the way.
 The supporting cast includes Edward Roland (Okello), Dan Ades (Perucho), Del Negro (Brother Carvajal), Armando Polanah (Armando) and Peter Berling (Don Fernando).  An honest consideration of instinctual behavior, ""Aguirre, Wrath of God,"" is a thought provoking study of the innate predisposition of man to go forth and conquer, regardless of-- or perhaps owing to-- his present situation, whatever or wherever it may be.  It's a rare film that will take you to a place wherein reality is seemingly an illusion reflected in madness, profoundly borne on the artistic wings of Werner Herzog.",987984000,74,4633,4.905249679897567

Megalomania, lust and seething rage send a doomed group of Spanish soldiers, a couple of women and an Incan noble into an abyss. Watch Kinski eat up the camera in every scene, and ponder the implications of Aguirre's actions. Great filmaking by Werner Herzog on location in another world! According to my source(s), Herzog wished the film to be presented full frame for this DVD presentation. Heaven knows why,if this is indeed true, because widescreen would be even better. The commentary track with the director almost makes up for the full frame presentation, and with it the docked star. Quibbles aside, this is a great, and haunting film.

A party of Spanish conquistidores blunders through the South American jungle, driven by a megalomaniac, in search of a place that does not exist.  Along the way, they brutalize the natives and each other as they sink ever deeper into a nightmare of starvation, terror and sickness.  Obviously, this is not a feel-good film and some viewers may be bored by its slow pace.  However, those who stay with it will be rewarded.

386549,5,630195517X,"Oh boy oh boy!  I just read that this film, Aguirre: the Wrath of God, is coming to DVD.  I can't wait!  This is probably Herzog's greatest film and a classic of recent German cinema.  For those unfamiliar with Herzog's  work, he also directed ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Nosferatu""  (a modern retelling of the classic vampire tale).
""Aguirre"" is  based on a true story of a band of Spanish conquistadors searching for El  Dorado.  The actual expedition was ill-fated, and so, the film inevitably  ends in a gloomy fashion.  But what a fascinating film it is!  The film  follows Aguirre, one of the conquistadors, who eventually assumes control  of the expedition and who slowly descends into madness as the expedition  runs into disaster after disaster.  Along the way, we are presented with a  multitude of astounding, almost hallucinatory, images.  For instance, the  film opens with an incredible shot of a long line of soldiers and their  caravan/bearers as they weave through the thick forests; the camera pulls  back in a single take and we suddenly realize that the trail must contain  perhaps hundreds of people along this dangerous footing.  The effect is  quite similar to that at the beginning of Charlie Chaplin's ""Gold  Rush"" where we see a never-ending line of hundreds of Klondike  prospectors along a snowy path.  It's quite astounding, especially when you  consider this was all shot on location; the difficulties and dangers  portrayed on film were actually encountered by the actors and filmmakers.  No special effects, here.
I would highly recommend this film to anyone  interested in German cinema and one of the greatest of the recent German  directors.  Five stars!",963446400,10,1681,5.04029304029304
386550,5,630195517X,"One of the many documentaries circulating around the world film festivals at the moment is `My Best Fiend', which deals with the often strained love-hate relationship between the German director Werner Herzog and his Teutonic prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Klaus Kinski.  Both highly egocentric personalities, bordering on narcissism, the documentary highlights the creative frisson at work, as well as the unbridled madness.
`Aguirre: The Wrath of God' is the culmination of their talents and arguably their best work.  Ostensibly about the early 16th Century Peruvian expedition for a lost city of gold by the Spanish explorer Pizarro, the actual subject matter is about power and what some people will do to achieve it.
Staggeringly hypnotic and lyrical, this film ranks in my top five films of all time for the simple reason that it is incredibly dreamlike, yet ironically, the most realistic evocation of a historical period that has ever been portrayed on film.
Opening with a sweeping pan over a winding Incan trail, a team of Spanish conquistadors, Indian allies and native American and African slaves, beasts of burden and heavy artillery march down a steep incline.  This is 1972 and there is no CGI, no trickery, Herzog actually forced his actors to lug a cannon around the Andes (and much more besides).  Almost immediately a viewer will notice the menacing power of nature and the isolation of the expedition party.  This isolation is what Aguirre calculatingly plays upon.
After the impressive opening, Pizarro's search for the city of gold (the Cibola of Peru) almost immediately runs into trouble. Uncertain of which direction to strike out for next, he divides his party into two and hands the leadership of the other party to a nobleman and assigns Aguirre as his lieutenant.  Aguirre has different ideas of what the goal of the expedition should be, namely that the quest for gold should be replaced with the conquering of a great slab of territory, as land brings power, not gold.  He continually undermines the nobleman leader and slowly lets his hunger for power come to the fore.  Eventually Aguirre tires of the yoke and mutinies, encouraging others to join him in his quest for power.  All the while, the party is slowly travelling by raft down a broad river (an upper tributary of the mighty Amazon?) being slowly decimated by both nature and the local inhabitants.  Oblivious to the dwindling party, the mad Aguirre wants to get to the end of the river and carve out his empire, regardless of the consequences. ...
Kinski's performance (as Aguirre) is absolutely first rate and the supporting cast are exceedingly talented, however, the power of the film lies behind the extremely adept way in which Herzog handles the visuals. It truly makes one feel like one is walking with the primitive, dirty, rapacious, immoral conquistadors.  These visuals are heightened by the wonderful music of Popul Vuh.  A `Krautrock' band, they nevertheless eschewed the harsh sparseness of Kraftwerk, Can, Neu, Harmonia and Cluster to come up with a far richer more melodic sound. Beautifully mournful organ music and soft pan flute music were used in all the right places to enhance the visuals' dreamlike qualities.
All in all, I can recommend this film wholeheartedly to any lover of cult movies, of history, or of European cinema.  It is, however, a very deliberately paced movie and would not be enjoyable to those who are looking for mindless action or who can not appreciate that cinema gives what you take out of it.  This film is an `experience' rather than mere `entertainment'.
A final note to any readers - this review is based on the cinema/video versions. The DVD has not been released yet and I have no idea of its picture quality or extras (doubtful).  I was just so excited that it is finally coming out on DVD, that I had to write this and hopefully get one other person to see it :-)",962582400,181,3903,4.937404580152672

As Aguirre, the mad leader of a Spanish expidition in search of gold in the Amazon, he seems on  the verge tearing everyone to pieces, including himself. Yet, his obsession  is great enough to domineer and consume everyone on his grand, insane quest  through the heart of the violent jungle.

386553,5,630195517X,"Herzog's superb direction and Kinsky's haunting performance combine to create one of the most breathtraking films I have ever seen.  The 'Wrath of God' deals not only with the tangible results of Aguirre's treacherous  insanity but also with the philosophical implications about the human  condition, and what would become of it if order was to be removed in favour  of pursuit of capital.  Kinsky plays madness like a man who knows his  subject too well and produces an excellent performance of a man driven to  self destruction by his own exaggerated sense of destiny.  The film  explores what would happen should man be removed from morality and social  constraint and Herzog nicely concludes that essentially life becomes a  struggle against nature and each other, treachery being a constant tool of  the psychotic Aguirre.  The final shots - Kinsky on his raft, alone but for  the monkeys are some of the best in cinematic history; as Aguirre rambles  on about commiting the ultimate treachery by taking Mexico from Cortes,  marrying his daughter ( deceased by this point ) and creating a 'purest  dynasty', Herzog pans the camera around him leaving the viewer with a  definate sense that he is alone but for the ambivalence of the jungle.

However, I found deeper ideas in Aguirre  emerging as their expedition drifted further into the engulfing jungle.  What's most enjoyable about this movie is exploring its symbology.  This is  the sort of film that will impress each viewer differently, so I won't try  to make a definitive analysis.  It is unmeasurable in rational terms.  Think of that unforgettable scene near the end where the monkeys are  swimming towards the raft--what does that mean?  My brain cannot grasp the  effect that scene had on me, but I do know how I felt at that moment. This  film reaches down to grasp primal, human fears, yet, in those depths it  also achieves a transcendence.  A masterpiece of vision and cinematography.",947030400,14,883,4.918367346938775

7817724,5,630195517X,"Now HERE is a film! The 1972 Werner Herzog opus Aguirre: The Wrath of God would have to count as one of my favorite movies of all time. I first saw this back in the mid-90's on a poor quality VHS tape. The picture kept fading in and out with the brightness factor, and I don't think it was a very good transfer. But I was hypnotized by this film, which I had never seen the likes of before. And now, all these years later, after seeing it on this dvd version, it's even better than ever.
  To sum up the plot: Several Spanish Conquistadors journey into the jungles of South America, to find the supposed lost city of El Dorado. An entire city made of pure gold. Eventually they decide to break up the party into sections to facilitate better chances of finding the mythical city. And right about there is when the film descends into a different kind of heart of darkness. Not exactly Willard going down the river to find Kurtz, but related in a way. (In fact, this film was a significant influence on Apocalypse Now). And Aguirre has a way of weaving a dreamlike spell on you which is often the hallmark of a truly great film.
  This is also the first collaboration between Herzog and the one and only Klaus Kinski. He is mesmerizing every time he is on screen. How could he not be? As the Conquistador determined to conquer the entire continent, and other imaginary realms, he is a force of nature and is never to be forgotten. The stories of Kinski and Herzog clashing on the set of this film, as well as the other 4 they made together, as justly part of film legend. But the feuding (wonderfully documented in My Best Fiend) pays off cinematic dividends here like never before.
  In the end, this movie works for the moments which stick out like lucid bits of an endless dream. The soldiers caught in the river rapids. The severed head which manages to get out one more word after it's chopped off. The woman who just disappears into the jungle like she never existed. The horse left behind in a bend of the river. The native piper playing on the pan flute. The entire ship caught up in a tree (or is it). And even the bird calls you hear every now and then throughout the film, which I could swear are the same ones you hear in Werner Herzog's film Fitzcarraldo. (Another all time masterpiece). Plus don't forget the haunting soundtrack by the European Prog-Rock group Popol Vuh. It has to be one of the great underrated movie soundtracks of all time. And the ending! Wow!
  Aguirre: The Wrath of God is considered a cult film, and I am one who worships at that particular alter. It is not a particularly arty or pretentious foreign film, which is good for the newbies. But you do have to surrender to the pace and flow of Aguirre, in order to ""get"" it. But it is worth it in every way. The dvd also contains a priceless audio commentary with Werner Herzog himself in English. You get to hear many great anecdotes about the making of the film, and it proves Herzog is one of the most fascinating directors as far as the commentary on his films goes.
  So if you love maverick filmmakers who would just go into the jungle to make an epic, not knowing if they would ever come out. If you pine for a time long past when a theater would show an Ingmar Bergman film, an Irwin Allen disaster film, a Clint Eastwood flick, and the latest offering from New Hollywood. If you love a movie that just goes somewhere mysterious, a place somewhere between dream, history and nightmare. This is a film that has to be seen to believed. Absolutely recommended.-------------------------------PEACE",1509840000,3,3584,4.458015267175573

7817727,2,630195517X,"I recently watched ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" for the first time ever....as it was shown on Turner Classic Movies.

After watching this flic, I feel that this movie is VASTLY overrated and kind of sucked; I'm truly amazed at the unanimous uber-high ratings by public and critics, alike.

The movie does have a lot of 'authentic' gleanings -to be fair: The regalia of both Spanish and indigenous peoples, the setting in the amazon, etc.  This is offset, however, by the the Spanish conquistadors speaking the ""Deutsch"" language throughout the movie: It doesn't matter that it's directed by a German......speak the language that was spoken (""Castilian"") in the New World -for Pistol Pete Maravich's sake!

The movie is a psychological-drama....with some action....and although the proper setting and mood are created -which entails a crew seeping into 'madness' and 'despair'- most of the movie 'plods' along very uninterestingly, and the movie ends up being mostly 'mundane' and 'barely-watcheable.  There isn't much action....and there isn't much 'point' to this movie.....and not only do the Conquistadors seem to cover much ground, or cover much headway down the river....the basic premise of the film is that they quarrel among themselves.....and slowly begin to die of starvation and being killed off by natives one-by-one....

The movie has a ""B""-grade feel to it -mostly for the 'worse,' rather than for the 'better'.....
In some ways it's almost like a remake of Michael Winner's ""Chato's Land"" which stars Charles Bronson as an Apache indian slowly killing off the posse sent after him 'one-by-one.'

A very overrated movie that has no 're-watcheable' appeal: 2 stars.",1504828800,,1677,5.258426966292135
7817728,4,630195517X,"Werner Herzog recreates a Spanish conquistador battalion in the Peruvian forests searching for the mythological El Dorado. It's a harrowing journey marred by famine and Inca natives defending their home.

The real star is, of course, Klaus Kinski in all his madness. He plays the conquistador, Aguirre, a man with delusions of grandeur. It becomes clearer and clearer as the film goes on that Kinski's character is indeed deluded by his mission to conquer. He fancies himself a successor to Cortez, but his mission is so obviously doomed from the start.

Watch as Herzog masterfully recreates rafting through rapids, 1560's meals, strategy, and a religious hypocrisy in the Spanish arrogance in attempting to rule lands they are so very ignorant of in all. This movie is well shot with long pans and hand cams, well acted and the dialogue is thoughtful.

Aguirre makes you wonder what the point of it all really is in the violence. It can get slow, but I found so many aspects of Aguirre, The Wrath of God to be fascinating throughout the film. An early Herzog master class in film-making.",1504483200,,1089,4.875675675675676
