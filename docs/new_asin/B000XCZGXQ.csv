3001343,5,B000XCZGXQ,"While my 2.5 yr old likes all the shows on this dvd, she particularly loves the first episode on the dvd, Kicho's Magic Flute.  Her second favorite is the second one, Green Iguana helps abuelito plant a new strawberry farm.",1288396800,3,223,4.575
3001344,2,B000XCZGXQ,"Like the other negative review, I have issues with the first episode on the DVD. I ran into the same problem with the ""Jaguar Day"": magic blended with science. If a series like ""Go, Diego, Go"" builds itself up as science-based, with great information and lessons about nature, it should remain grounded in reality. True, the animals do talk, but it is easier for a 2 or 3 year-old to process this flight of fancy than it is for them to understand the fantastical when it is interwoven with factual representations of animals and wildlife, with no indication that one is real and one is imagined.",1260057600,3,595,4.622641509433962

3001346,2,B000XCZGXQ,"I bought this DVD for my 1.5 year old daughter, who loves Diego. She enjoys this DVD tremendously so for that reason I give it two stars. However, the first two episodes (this DVD contains a total of four episodes) are just too bizarre. In the first, a shape-shifting magic man steals a flying flute by turning into any animal he wants. In the second, Diego's grandfather's strawberry farm is saved by the green iguana, who poops out strawberry seeds to replenish the fields. I usually skip to the third and fourth episodes, which are undersea adventures with whales and octupuses.",1204070400,18,581,4.762376237623762
