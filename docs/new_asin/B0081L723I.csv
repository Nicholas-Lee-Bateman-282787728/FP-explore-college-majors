These episodes are an example of how bad this show became, especially the Luke Snyder story ending pathetically without reuniting him and Noah, while pimping a useless character like Reid down our throats.  We had no time to get to know him or invest in him, therefore, he was useless and the last few months of the show was excrutiatingly painful to watch.  I also cannot stand Carly.

This show ignored the veterans and what is saddest of all, was the finale.  It was so lame.  Most ATWT fans agree on this.  Do not buy this edition unless you want to see ATWT at its worst.  Get the 1979 episodes instead if you want to see ATWT in its prime!!",1423785600,3,710,4.318181818181818
8524027,5,B0081L723I,"Exactly what I was looking for! As The World Turns was a giant among serial television, yet undermined in the last decade of its existence by bad casting and writing. This finale, like a refreshing breeze, literally sweeps all that away and brings back the veterans in the blink of an eye... like none of that ever even happened.  This DVD set is a vital piece of your collection if you're a longtime fan of this show.  Watching these episodes feels like a family reunion, like you've come home to Oakdale to be with your family during a medical crisis. Centering the finale around Christopher Hughes, now a doctor with a critical heart condition, was a genius touch... a fitting tribute to the show's beginning, which featured his great-grandparents, Christopher and Nancy Hughes. The traditions, warmth, and nuance we always expected from this show are all here, along with an engaging and absorbing plot that moves quickly at times but never fails to deliver. Breaking new ground was second nature to As The World Turns, and they also honor that tradition, giving the courageous hero role to the gay doctor who is in a brand new relationship with another man we've seen since infancy: Luke Snyder. The heartbreak of the main storyline are balanced with comedy as Dusty, Carly and Jack bring a new life into the world, Barbara welcomes Paul and Emily, Lucinda declares independence in her intelligently unique way, Tom & Margo still have that old spark, and an older but wiser Jack & Carly re-tie the knot. There's even a nod to the Luke/Noah fans, as a tentative friendship is reborn with talk of meeting up in the future. Only the lack of Martha Byrne as Lily and the odd writing for Eileen Fulton as Lisa mars this finale. Also, the teenage characters, while well-acted, were too recently aged for me to care about their story. However, by the end, perfectly written for Bob and Kim, our reunion with all of these characters we came to care about and think of as family has warmed our hearts and that's what has always kept soaps alive.",1405814400,2,2041,4.698324022346369
8524028,5,B0081L723I,I was so sad when the show went off the air.  After DVRing the last 10 days my cable boxes were being replaced... Started search to see if I could find them anywhere so I didn't lose them.  Yeahhhhh - Had to order as soon as I found this....  There are actually 3 other soaps I would love to find on DVD but for now Thankful I have As The World Turns last 10 days...,1399593600,,366,3.8533333333333335
8524029,5,B0081L723I,"I watched ATWT for over 15 years and was sad to see it end, but I am very thankful that Soap Classics is releasing these DVDs of the show, something I've always wondered why Soaps don't do more often. It is great to have the last two weeks as a keepsake to remember the show by - and it helps that I can clear out some space on my DVR now and don't have to worry about what happens if I ever switch cable companies or need a new DVR - Thank you Soap Classics!",1338595200,5,459,3.8421052631578947
8524030,5,B0081L723I,"This is excellent for fans of the long running As The World Turns ! Wraps up lots of stories in the usual Oakdale style. Really enjoyed this as my favorites Eileen Fulton as Lisa Grimaldi, and Colleen Zenk as Barbara Ryan, are featured. With the drama surrounding Luke Snyder and the retirement of Bob Hughes the show really went out a winner. Buy this one !",1338163200,5,358,4.4393939393939394
8524031,2,B0081L723I,"I rarely, if ever, give a two-star rating on a product, but I had to with Soap Classics new DVD release of the last 10 episodes of ""As the World Turns"". This would have been different if the show had been more compelling and watchable during its last few ywars on the air, but everyone knows the reason ""World Turns"" was cancelled was because of shoddy writing and poor producing on the part of thos e in charge. ""As the World Turns"", during its last 10 years of broadcasting on CBS, was only a shadow of its former glory self and to put these last poorly written shows on DVD is a travesty as there is so much more in the Proctor and Gamble archives that Soap Classics could put out there. Mostly everything before the fall of 1979 has been destroyed due to wiping, but what about the Dobson years from the early 1980's or the marvelous Douglas Marland period (1985-1993)? And surely if they dug deep enough they COULD find some old material from the 1950's to 1979 as many episodes due exist in private collections and in museums.

 I am an ardent soap opera buff and we fans WANT material prior to the end of the 1980's on DVD, especially anything from the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's. Let's hope our wish is granted. We saw enough of this stuff (the 2000's) in their original broadcast and nobody watched so why would we watch this drivel again?",1336435200,9,1347,4.405622489959839
