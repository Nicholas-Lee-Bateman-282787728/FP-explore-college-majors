3751962,4,B001PO5N6G,"So I got me a copy of ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" and I'll tell you what, I didn't expect what I got. It was an awesome movie in every sense of the word. If you love life then you should see this movie because this is life at it's best. A journey through a mans life that is running backwards in age was very interesting, the only part I thought was weird was when he was getting younger and eventually went back to being a baby. Other than that this was a great story about just living your life to the fullest and to just be happy no matter what life throws at you, If you liked ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00AEFY0F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>"" than you should like this movie.

Cate Blancett did a very good job as Benjamin's love and I thought her to be more attractive than usual in this one. All around good acting and a great life and love story, highly recommend this for everyone to see. But on a side note, love life and live it to the fullest everyday because someday we all gotta go, why not make the best outta what we have? That's how this movie inspired me, to live my life to the fullest and to be happy with everything I have and not to take life for granted. I really hope some of you watch this movie and feel what I felt from it.",1237852800,4,1336,4.475409836065574
3751963,5,B001PO5N6G,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a wonderfully staged fantasy based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's fantasy about a boy born old and aging younger instead of older. The story could obviously be off-putting and distracting, but everyone involved does such a magnificent job of telling this story that it is not hard to accept this as fact, and following the story as it shows Benjamin growing younger and falling in love with a young girl named Daisy.

Benjamin and Daisy's story and the balance of Benjamin's life impart so many valuable life lessons that it is hard to recount them all - the idea that life brings many hardships and the best we can do is doing the best we can with what we're given, making the most of every moment because life is fleeting and unpredictable, find the joy and happinessin life and hold on to it dearly, and many other lessons.

""Benjamin Button"" gives Brad Pitt the chance to shine in the title role, and he makes the most of it. He is ably assisted by Cate Blanchett as Daisy, Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother, Tilda Swinton as another love of Benjamin's, and many others. This film is marvelous and a hopeful fable for all of us.",1237852800,54,1180,4.561320754716981
3751964,5,B001PO5N6G,"Okay, so call me old fashioned, call me cliche, call me vapid, but I really, really love The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Damn all those who say its Forrest Gump 2.0, damn those who say its too long, damn everyone who thinks its overly shamltzy, I think its a great film and one of the best fantasy films since LOTR.

The story tells of Benjamin Button, who by some weird twist of fate, was born with the body of an old man and as he gets older, he ages backwards. We are then taken on his life and all his life adventures, from growing up in an old folks home with his adoptive mother Queenie, spending his early adult life as a sea boater, and coming back to America for his childhood friend and love interest Daisy.

I think I speak for everyone that the film is gorgeously made, considering it did pick up three Oscars for many of its technical aspects, the set pieces evoking the time period, the cinematography rich, art direction meticulous, and of course, those special effects, those awesome special effects that transform the handsome Brad Pitt from an old man to a spiting image of Brad the first time we saw him in Thelma & Louise.

Now unlike many, I actually thought Button was that film that didn't feel long. At nearly three hours, you would expect this to be true but for me, the film really just glided along and the pacing was so effortless, it was like I was transported to another world, something I haven't experienced since, ironically, LOTR.

This mostly has to do with Fincher, known for his dark, sinster films like Seven and Zodiac. Leaving behind all that for a more lighter fair, you can still detect his touches in the film. After all, this film is essentally about life and death, Benjamin slowly aging backwards, his life in reverse, watching as the world changes while he seems to be going further and further into the past, all leading towards that time when he will eventually die. And I for one think Fincher keeps things from getting to shmaltzy, giving the film a heart but not such a ooey, gooey center that feels too sweet.

Each actor also brings life to their performance. Brad Pitt is able to act through all that make up and effects to deliver a very sturdy and calm performance, something I think that many would have think was way to subtle in order to pull of the effects, but I think it works, he dosen't try too hard to make it a good performance, he just does. Taraji P. Henson was a very nice surprise as Benjamin's adoptive mom Queenie, giving both wit, charm, and personality, but once again, keeping it from becoming too stereotyped or cliche. And as always, Cate Blanchett is as a great as ever (still very shocked she was ignored through out the awards season).

Honestly, I think Benjamin Button is one of those films that you either love it or hate it. For me, I fall into the love it catagory, and you know what? I'm proud off it. Whether or not you like Brad Pitt, or don't life fantasy films, or just turned off by some of the lukewarm reviews, give Button a chance. Maybe you'll hate it, maybe you'll be indifferent, but if your like me, you'll find a very rich, thoughtfull, and heart tugging film that is that true Hollywood experience.",1237766400,5,3204,4.4683760683760685
3751965,3,B001PO5N6G,"Walking into `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' I was excited.  I had read the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and so my appetite was wet.  Not only that, but the film had been raved by many as the best of the year; it was winning all sorts of awards and looked prime for the Best Picture Oscar.  Aside from that, I am a huge fan of Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt and so I think it is safe to say that `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' looked like it just may be the perfect movie to me.

In a world filled with the same ol' same it is always refreshing to see a film with such an original prose.

Truth be told, when walking into a film so widely hyped and anticipated one is often setting themselves up for disappointment, which is sad because one is not able to separate hype from the actual experience long enough to gather their own individual (un-manipulated) feelings on the matter.  That is precisely why I loathe writing a review so soon after seeing a film, without fully processing it as a whole, and it is precisely why I wait until a films DVD release to give my final collected thoughts.

Sadly, with `Benjamin', I couldn't wait.

Walking out of `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' I felt a little cold.  Many critical reviews of the film labeled that the films solitary weakness; that it left you emotional detached.  It was less that and more emotionally robbed I think.  I wanted to feel attachment and I wanted to feel moved, but I didn't.  There are moments (especially with regard to Benjamin's decisions about `family') that play with the heart strings and can bring tears, but the films delivery is at such a stagnant pace that it makes it difficult to find an emotional foundation.  Brad Pitt's performance, while solid, is at times almost lifeless and this can add to the lack of emotional chemistry with the audience.  He tells us how one should be feeling (in a very slick and enjoyable voice over) but we can never truly grasp what Benjamin is feeling because he is so closed off.

He is merely an observer, letting us see the journey of his life but never truly letting us experience it with him.  Someone mentioned the word `canvas', that Benjamin was a blank canvas on which those around him painted the story of their lives.  That sounds about right, for it is the people around Benjamin that engage us the most.

Having read the short story I of course have my qualms with the films adaptation, minor as they may be.  Let me first say that the film is drastically different from the story, which is shocking since the short story was expertly crafted.  Having Benjamin grow up in a nursing home under the care of a foster mother was an inspired departure from the story, and it gave way to some nice character development on the part of Benjamin, Daisy and of course his foster mother Queenie.  I am not upset about this alteration one bit.  In fact, I am delighted with it.  My main complaint with the films departure from printed page comes in the films end, (and subsequently the films `modern day' beginnings) and the way that Benjamin's `family' is handled.

I'll scream SPOILERS...just so you are aware.

In the story the real meat of Fitzgerald's moral comes from the way Benjamin is regarded by his loved ones once he becomes `younger' than they are.  Whether it is Daisy's disgust with her younger husband merely because he is a constant reminder of her age or his children's disgust with their father beings that they must now take care of him, the story's major wind is found in its ending.  I won't say how this film ends, but let's just say that the choice made my Button in regards to his family, while emotional upon impact, is much less effective or enlightening as Fitzgerald's original prose.

On another note in regards to the ending, I felt as if it was trying to make up for the films overall stiffness by giving us that sentimental monologue that just didn't fit (""some people dance"").

The films biggest conundrum is David Fincher, the films director.  I am a huge fan of his work and was very excited to see him garnering the respect and admiration he has so long deserved, but this is not the film for which he should have received it.  He may deliver the film to us almost like a poet, but his poem is almost devoid of real substance.  It is very fluid and very `epic' yet it still feels very small.  I told a friend that this was a small story given epic treatment yet it still comes off like a small film.  This is a blessing and a malediction, for the film has the intimate qualities of an independent film with the visual grandeur of an epic Hollywood escapade.  That's the blessing.  The malediction comes from the fact that, while it boasts the visual splendor (an area in which it excels) it never takes full advantage of the intimacy it possesses.  There are so many quiet moments within `Button' that feel lost.  There is a delicate side story containing the marvelous Tilda Swinton that is probably the most effective and `complete' portion of the film, and it made me sad because the rest of the film lacked the sharpness that that sequence of events contained.  When you watch the film you may not immediately see what I'm pointing out (although if you read this before you watch the film then you might see it front and center) so I can't fault it too much.  Fincher does some phenomenal work here visually, but emotionally he drops the ball.

It is beautiful to look at, each frame floating by like clouds.  Nothing is choppy; nothing is rigid; every frame is smooth and delicate and comforting.

As far as the acting is concerned, it is solid but never truly noteworthy.  Brad Pitt is a very capable actor, but like I've already mentioned, his delivery of Benjamin is more of an observer, not a participant.  Cate Blanchett is stunning in scenes, downright captivating at times, but goes cold towards the films end, where sentiment would have been most effective, and this put me off a bit.  Tilda Swinton and Taraji P. Henson give the most inspired performances here.  Swinton makes the most of her small screen time to deliver a truly touching performance, and Henson uses her charm and fiery deliver to add a glimmer of life to her scenes that are captivating and utterly essential.  I also enjoyed Jason Flemyng's portrayal of Benjamin's father Thomas, and I was so excited that the screenwriters still worked in Benjamin's relationship with his father even though they changed his living arrangements.

As many have already noted about this film though, it is not an actor's showcase.  This is a technical achievement if nothing else, and technically it is splendid.  Fincher has crafted what may very well be his most technically proficient film.  It's just a shame that that proficiency was not carried on into the heart of the film.  Fincher failed to balance out the two ends of his film and thus delivered to us a beautifully shot yet emotionally vapid film.

I did like this movie, and maybe over time I will see it differently.  I just don't love it like I thought I would have.  It could have been improved upon had Pitt delivered a little more life to Benjamin.  It also would have been preferable to have some of the films center trimmed to allow more depth given to the films end, which is really the most important part of the story.  I cannot knock this movie entirely (and I'm sorry if it looks like I'm ripping it to shreds in parts of this review) because it is entertaining and enjoyable and very beautifully directed; but I must call it out for its missteps and at least be true to my own opinions.  I'd watch it again, most definitely, but the film feels sorely like a missed opportunity.

I just want to close out by saying that while I wrote this review months ago, after my first viewing of the film, I have since revisited the film and reviewed my review and I agree with every word.",1237766400,5,7894,4.53319209039548
3751966,5,B001PO5N6G,"For all reviewers who bashed this movie, I say you just didn't ""get it"".  Sure, it's a fantasy so you have to take that as intended.  But there are some real messages here.  It should get you to thinking about how we look (and deal with) acceptance of one another, relationships, death, our parents, love and the many people we meet in life who help shape who we are.  Too many movies nowadays are over the top in action.

3751968,3,B001PO5N6G,"Let me get this right out there, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a well made film with great acting. It just doesn't have any solid point but following the old young man until he is a young old man. Like anyone's life shown in whole, there is no climax and only a few interesting revelations which show themselves too early before the film's end. In short, everything that is done in this film was done much better in Forrest Gump and with more humor. The CGI process of making people look old and young is a true revolution in technology. It is thanks to that and everyone's fine acting that this got 3 stars from me. Worth a rental but not a buy.",1237680000,4,655,4.248

3751970,2,B001PO5N6G,"Oscar nomination or not, this is the most boring movie I've seen since MEET JOE BLACK. It's sad to see so much talent and effort gone to waste but what exactly is appealing about this story ? Why on earth would a little girl and a seemingly old man find themselves bonded to each other in the first place ? Why don't Guiness/Ripley or the media stop by when what you've got here is the ultimate freak story ?. The only fun I had throughout this movie was making a list of the similarities with Forrest Gump which run in the several dozens. The Katrina back-story could have been of interest but at the end, all they used it for is as an excuse to flood a room ! This movie has easily the best aging effects in history but you end up noticing you spend most of the time evaluating them instead of getting involved with the story which is the basic symptom that this movie fails.",1237420800,7,877,4.226190476190476
3751971,5,B001PO5N6G,"The Curious Case of Benjamim Button is by no means a feel-good movie. In fact upon watching it, I felt depressed even the next day just thinking about it. People may confuse this for a love story but to me the film clearly symbolizes death. The love aspect is certainly present, though it is not the center of attention here.

Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin Button, a man who essentially ages backwards. When he is born, his own father attempts to drown him before a sudden change of heart has him leaving the swaddled and very whithered newborn upon the steps of an elderly home. There he is found by Queenie, played to motherly perfection by Taraji P. Henson. She sees past the deformity and oddity and loves him immediately.

Instead of dying, as a doctor predicted, Benjamin actually begins to age backwards. He appears as a very old man and slowly grows younger, but only in body. His mind seems to function as a typical human's mind. He learns, and dreams and experiences. This basically sets up the magnificent story and from then on, you are taken from country to country, from one decade, to another and it is just superb to witness.

The acting is fantastic all around. Brad Pitt does an outstanding job, portraying both the old Benjamin as well as his younger counterpart. Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend/love interest is also a joy to watch. She can do no wrong, she is simply stunning. For such a short part, Tilda Swinton surely makes the most of it. Her tale and part with Benjamin in Russia is just stunning. There is also the talented Julia Ormond, who has a bigger part to play in the tale than we may realise at first.

The most impressive aspect of the film is the flawless visual effects. Just flawless. You have never seen aging/deaging done like this. There is a scene, towards the end, with Benjamin and Daisy (Blanchett) that had my jaw dropping. It was like looking back in time. I can't describe how utterly impressed I was. The cinematography, the sad musical score, the costumes, just every little minute detail is just so impressive and authentic.

I have heard grumbles from people who compare it to Forrest Gump. What? How? There should not be any comparing the two films-or the two characters. Gump was a slow and mostly ignorant person who fell into unbelievable situations. Button clearly chooses his own paths, though it may not seem it, at the beginning. It irritates me how someone can make such a comparison.

This is a long film, nearly three hours, though with the plot and subject matter, it makes sense and really, it is such a beautiful film, you hardly notice the passing of time. Like I mentioned, it will leave you feeling blue but that does not diminish from the fact this is one of the better newer films out there now, and one that people will remember in the future.",1237420800,271,2821,4.598409542743539

My wife dropped out after 15 minutes, finding it incomprehensible and boring.  Though the film fails to make clear what causes Benjamin to ""age in reverse,"" my conjecture is that a large clock purposely built to run backward magically caused ONLY Benjamin's life to run backward.  That is one preposterous premise for a story!  There are more improbabilities along the way, such as his father's finding him after many years, in a big city.  Besides being unbelievable, the movie is replete with disgusting scenes of vomit, flies in a jar of honey, prostitution, and drunkenness.

3752145,3,B001PO5N6G,"This is a movie that many reviewers obviously deeply loved, but which others have found unsatisfying. As someone in the latter camp, let me take a stab at helping those who are trying to decide whether to watch this movie which camp they might fall in. Ultimately, I think the viewer's experience will depend on whether she or he most enjoys movies that focus on ""being"", or those that focus on ""becoming"". Viewers who derive great enjoyment from sharing a character's experiences of love, pleasure, pain, etc., will find much to like in this film. It's the work of top flight talent. However, viewers who get their pleasure from exploring the deeper effects of a character's unique experiences on his or her development as a person will probably find little to justify this film's nearly 3 hour viewing time. While it's a visually beautiful movie with much to like, in the end I felt it did little to exploit its very interesting premise of the main character's ""reverse aging"" (being born old and becoming progressively younger throughout his lifespan). The biggest problem for was the lack of central character development throughout the course of the film--the sense that Benjamin was doing more than experiencing and feeling, but was also learning and growing. He was like a travel suitcase that ended up with lots of stickers on the outside marking the interesting places he'd visited, but containing little of substance that he'd picked up along the way. Benjamin remained for me essentially an uninteresting person to whom interesting things happened, and that just wasn't enough for me to lift this into the category of great movies.",1510704000,26,1642,4.974545454545455

3752283,1,B001PO5N6G,"While I can see how this movie is meant to be touching and evocative, it has some serious issues, the worst of which is a tendency towards racial-historical denialism (idk if that is the most precise term). It's too firmly grounded in history/timelines for the people who produced it not to google some basics. Plus the movie's nearly 3 hrs long, and absolutely tedious--everyone knows the story going in; no need to establish every quirk. Some of the fake southern accents are terrible--at best they sound put-on, at worst they sound mocking. Oh and, since the majority of the movie is a flashback as read by the daughter to whom it's addressed, you kind of wonder at all the sex scenes (nobody wants to hear that about their parents.... Benjamin Button is a reserved guy so why the sudden indiscretion?)
(The movie's excessive length invites the mind to wander in an effort to avoid boredom, which leads one to consider all kinds of possibilities! Like ""Daisy's"" age at childbirth... hmmm. Or what the movie might be saying about the relative merits of absentee fatherhood. (Also, I think the fact that they used Brad Pitt's real baby is beyond creepy. But okay!))

This may be the worst movie I've ever seen because, in addition to crippling oversights, there is almost no upside. It's filled with cloying, unrealistic hopes and the flattest, doofy emotionalism. Oh, and, the dialogue: ""[Daisy]: Sleep with me? [Benji]: Absolutely!"" ----seriously?

As penance for my ranting criticism, I wanted to list some upsides:
1) Tilda Swinton is excellent (if the movie were a short film with just the Tilda Swinton parts, it'd be waaay more interesting)
2) Cate Blanchett looks very pretty with red hair
2) the first fifteen and last fifteen minutes of the film make a (remarkably!) moving parallel between Katrina and war (i think the movie started at the end of WWI --1918 seems right?) --especially if the parallel was to WWI, when the end of the war didn't bring peace, and ""resolutions"" paved the way for future problems. I stopped going to New Orleans in 2010 but huge parts still hadn't been cleaned up 5 years after the hurricane // ~2 years after this movie. Katrina relief was so profoundly insufficient, and the hurricane caused such devastation, that nola really was what I imagine a war zone would look like. So yes, while most of the movie made me gag, the clockmaker's speech hit oddly close to home.

It is beautiful and heartbreaking in its honesty and never ceases to make me cry every single time I watch it. A movie that can solicit such a response from me despite how many times I watch it, is a masterpiece in my eyes. The cast is star studded with amazing actors who add color and substance to the whole world the film makers created. I smiled when they smiled and laughed when they laughed and feel genuinely invested in a man aging backward.

3752296,5,B001PO5N6G,"This is actually a story within a story. Primarily, it tells an exceptional story of a man born with an unfortunate variation of ""projeria"", a disease that causes premature aging. In this fictitious variation, the baby is born with features and medical conditions consistent with a 70-year-old man but appears to be aging in reverse. The story is presented in the form of flash-backs from a hand-written diary that a young woman reads to her dying mother. As she reads more of it she begins to suspect that her mother's past is much more intertwined with this unfortunate (or fortunate) man than she first thought. By the time she finishes the diary she learns the truth about her mother's attempts to atone for her selfishness and some life-changing truths about herself. After his mother dies during child birth this unfortunate baby's father, repulsed by his appearance, abandons him on the steps of an ""old folks home"". A warm-hearted nurse takes pity on him and raises him as her own child right there in the nursing home. Because of his appearance, everyone assumes he is a frail old man. This gets him in trouble when he innocently yearns to play with others his age. He forms a bond with a visiting young girl that is renewed and strengthened later in life. The story follows his life through evermore thrilling and heart-warming adventures as he appears to get increasingly younger, periodically encountering his childhood friend. Folded into the pages of the dusty diary are postcards, photos, and notes that reveal more about how the daughter and her dying mother are connected to the man her mother has kept secret from her all these years... Stellar performances by Brad Pitt (Benjamin Button), Cate Blanchett (Daisy), and Taraji Henson (Queenie). Bravo!!!",1504137600,5,1769,4.959595959595959

As I have taken care of people who are at the end of life, it seems to be a reversal of roles.  Outward appearance does not determine age or intelligence.  Young minds look in shock at the stranger in the mirror.  Deserved the Academy Awards with exceptional and versatile performance by Brad Pitt.

3752349,3,B001PO5N6G,"I wish I would have gotten younger while watching this movie. The concept was cool by my goodness did it ever drag on.

I'll give it a 2nd star because it was well acted. Brad Pitt is playing a very unique character in that he is an old man with no life experience then a young man with decades of life experience. That's unique and opposite of normal character development. So that is a tough sell for an actor. An actor playing an old man has to carry himself with certain mannerisms that indicate he's tired and worn down while showing wisdom about the world around him. When playing a young man he has to show vibrancy and wonder about the world. This flips it all around. Pitt had to be young but wise and old but naive. As the viewer that's the opposite of everything you know about people so it messes with your mind. It would have been EASY for any actor to underdeliver that role and have the character be unbelievable. Pitt makes you believe the impossible character traits of Benjamin Button. So it's VERY well acted.

And it gets a 3rd star star because it was gorgeously filmed. I mean visually it's stunning. They color theme of the whole thing is dull Earth tones (browns, dull yellows, stuff like that) and somehow it still came across as visually vibrant. It's not easy to do that with a brown centered pallet. So MAJOR props to the cinematography.

But holy cow did the story ever just drag on forever. The story telegraphs it's own ending about 20 minutes into the film. So you almost immediately see where the story is going and what's going to happen. Then you're just waiting for it to get there.

And they tried to make the whole thing connected to Hurricane Katrina, but it didn't come across clearly.

I also wonder how come if he starts off as a baby sized old man, how come he doesn't turn into an old man sized baby?",1501632000,4,1844,4.395894428152492

3752367,5,B001PO5N6G,"I loved this. Beautifully done on almost every level, thoroughly imagined, and well-written. Wonderful performances from two great actors, as well as several excellent supporting ones. Even better, both the main characters are extraordinarily lovable, compelling, and an unusual joy to watch. Benjamin Button is an especially endearing creature, masterfully imagined and brought to life (minus two CGI glitches, but it sounds like most people didn't even notice this). I must say, I haven't seen a Hollywood character so endearing in a long time. Maybe because he starts out in such a doubly vulnerable, humble position -- which I do wish they'd unpacked just a little more, in terms of its effects on his psyche throughout life. But I think the point of that is that sometimes the things that may seem outwardly tragic or handicapping are really ""miraculous"" gifts that elevate us by making us better, wiser, more loving people. And as other reviewers have said better than me, this film really does have an extraordinary loving quality to it, a warmth and humanity so unfortunately rare for Hollywood these days. So glad I listened and decided to watch this! Cate Blanchett also shines as Daisy, a complex, charismatic character that wins us from the get-go. Both of them are perfectly imperfect. In fact, nearly every character has a certain perfectly imperfect humanity that's really hard to articulate but somehow touching in hindsight.

And did I mention it was R E A L L Y  L O N G ?  I had to watch it in three installments it was so painful.  But I always finish what I start!

What really bugged me though -- MILD SPOILER ALERT HERE -- was that he was born a baby-sized old man.  So shouldn't he have died an old-man-sized baby?  That was what kept me going in that last awful hour, the hope that I was gonna see Brad transformed into a gigantic dying baby!  It would have been super creepy-cool.  But no, he died a REGULAR SIZED BABY.  Completely illogical and horribly disappointing.",1500854400,,749,4.401459854014599

If you have three hours to invest here it's well worth the time.,1500508800,,339,4.573770491803279
3752387,1,B001PO5N6G,"This movie is a obviously fashioned after Forrest Gump. The same monotone voice over and several of the characters repeated. The main difference is this movie is depressing. If you can overlook the absurd premise that the guy ages backwards, it still doesn't have anything positive to say. He is a coward who abandoned his wife only one year after the birth of their daughter. She is a promiscuous woman who desires the New York City lifestyle. They try to rewrite history and paint America as a amoral society from the end of the first world war while characterizing other nations as superior. Basically this is a left wing propaganda piece.

I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.

When this movie came out, I watched it but I didn't care for it.  Now that I'm a little older, I just re-watched it and honestly, I cried at the end.  It's a lot like Forrest Gump, a man born under less than ideal circumstances, but somehow he finds the will to live and thrive.  Benjamin is not perfect, although his love for Daisy was unconditional, his lust for women often led him astray.  In the end, he finds what life is all about and sets off to live it.

3752510,4,B001PO5N6G,"This is a pretty great film.  It has an interesting and unique story which seems like it was adapted pretty well from the book.  I haven't read the book like most movies based off books, but I'm sure it's great too.

The cinematography, effects and acting are all amazing here.  All the characters/roles are very believable.  The film spans several generations of time and does a great job at portraying the different time periods and changes that occur over the years.

I enjoyed the special features detailing the making of the film and all the aspects involved.  There's a whole extra disc of them so there's no shortage of content here.

I would give it 5 start but have given it 4 since I can deal without some of the language and sexual content in the film.  I also prefer blu-ray over dvd but I get things when they're cheap like this for black Friday.

Separate from this film, in the movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, they take inspiration from this film to make a comedic beat in that movie which is hilarious.  So a mark of a good film is when other filmmakers can successfully draw inspiration from good movies and incorporate something memorable from it in their own picture.",1474156800,,1193,4.553990610328638

3752514,5,B001PO5N6G,"I purchased this 2-movie feature for my father when he asked me to get him a copy of Forrest Gump, and when I saw that the double feature was even cheaper than some versions of FG, I just had to spring for it! He loved Benjamin Button, which is a rarity for my father to say he likes anything new to him. The fact that he enjoyed both features is definitely a plus in my book making this a must-buy for anyone who loves Forrest Gump and also wants to try something they may not have seen before as an extra bonus! It is cheap so don't expect a super-durable case to go with the DVD, but in terms of getting a movie he's wanted for a long time it's very much worth it.",1473292800,2,667,3.985074626865672

3752553,5,B001PO5N6G,"Spoiler alert! Thomas Button arrives home to New Orleans after the cessation of WWI to the birth of his son, Benjamin (Brad Pitt), in 1919. The mother succumbs, and Thomas abandons the days-old infant on the doorstep of Miss Queenie. She is a black woman and head of household, who sees the baby as a miracle delivered from God to cherish. She adopts and raises the infant as though she gave birth to him, as if he was her own flesh and blood. During a Thanksgiving Day reunion in 1930, Benjamin becomes acquainted with 6-year-old Daisy (Cate Blanchett). In 1936, Benjamin, 17, leaves home and his tearful mother, Miss Queeie. He travels the world by sea for three years to Newfoundland, Baffin Bay, Glasgow, Liverpool, Narvik, and finally settles in India. After the Pearl Harbor attacks on December 7, 1941, Benjamin enlists in the Navy. In May of 1945, at 26, he returns home, looking more youthful than when he left. By some blazing genetic mutation, fantastical twist of nature, Benjamin was aging in reverse, getting younger (he was born in a decrepit, elderly state but rejuvenates physically, although he regresses from emotional maturity to immaturity as he ages). He intercedes into Daisy's life, once again, in the Spring of 1962, they elope, and have a daughter, Caroline. Though she did love him, he did not want to make a long-term commitment. After his daughter's first birthday, Benjamin tells Daisy that he is leaving her, because he doesn't want to burden her with raising two children, raising Caroline and himself, as he regresses. She was shocked by his departure. He rationalized he was doing it for Daisy, but selfishly relieved himself of any responsibly, so he could travel again as he did in his chronological youth. Fortunately for Daisy, she reunited with a former lover that became her caring husband and Caroline's surrogate father.",1465603200,4,1862,4.93312101910828

3752615,5,B001PO5N6G,"It takes great actors proficient in their art to pull off a drama of this caliber. The movie is painfully human in its depth, sensitive in its human feelings, and respectful of the human dilemma; each of us is in one stage or another of dying from the day we are born. To graciously accept this fate and still be capable of giving love is our redeeming nature.

3752679,3,B001PO5N6G,"It is rather interesting to note that a creative story, written to be no more than a SHORT story, is here transformed into a rather long film. Nonetheless, it is interesting to watch, and is certainly well done in many aspects.

It is NOT depressing (as one viewer mentioned) but more of a thoughtful, pensive piece. It can tug on the heart strings, but it is not a truly depressing film, nor is it a tragedy. The main premise is to simply explore what life would be like if a child was one day born old and ugly, slowly grew young and beautiful, and then became innocent and completely without memory.

I do feel that something is missing, which I cannot place my finger on though. The acting is excellent, the aging (and UN-aging) process very well done, the lighting and sets great, and so on. I did find it rather obnoxious that he (Benjamin - and this is a spoiler alert) left his child, when he clearly appeared to have at least another twenty years where he could have raised her and been there, with enough time to eventually explain things to her. That was frustrating, and perhaps may have led to part of why the film seemed to miss something. Plus, the young love interest became cocky, arrogant, and annoying in her 20s, and was a real turn off in regards to enjoying the plot line.

I suppose it is really a little vignette of a story that did not realize it was supposed to be so, and therefore stretched itself out quite without need. It tried to present itself as the epic story of one mans life, when it was never intended to be. Yet it was an interesting watch, despite the fact that many scenes were not necessary to the entire story line. It missed something, but it had something all the same. I suppose that makes it curious, in more ways than one.",1442275200,2,1770,4.390243902439025

3752849,4,B001PO5N6G,"I see a lot of reviews of this movie being depressing or not having a point. As for depressing, well if a movie can give me an emotional reaction than it's succeeded in it's purpose. The fact a group of actors in makeup with spot lights on them and a film crew of hundreds gathered around them can create a product that makes you feel depressed or happy or afraid is impressive to me. And it does have a point.

At its core, this is a simple love story. 2 young people people meet, travel their separate paths in life, then meet again at middle age and fall in love. They eventually grow old together. The only twist is that the man in the relationship is aging backward physically. The point of the movie is to make the viewer wonder how they would react watching the love of their life growing younger before their eyes. Sure, going from a 50 year old to a 40 year old would be amazing, but how do you handle seeing them appear 10 years old? How about 5 years old? Knowing their life won't last much longer. It's the same life issues a wife deals with if her husband gets Alzheimer's, gets arthritis and can't walk, or has a heart attack and becomes paralyzed. But he's visually younger instead of wrinkled and aged. Blanchett's Daisy handles it with grace and patience. She has known Benjamin since she was a little girl, probably the only person left in his life who fully understands what is happening to him and has the love in her heart to bear with him as he grows into an infant. He forgets about her, he forgets his whole life, but she stays by him to the end. Forget gimmicky special effects or acadamy award this or that, just watch the movie closely and see how much Daisy loves Benjamin througout her life even with his bizarre affliction.",1428278400,7,1753,4.36085626911315

3752917,5,B001PO5N6G,"Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)  Based on the 1922 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this drama-romance-fantasy captures a unique tale of what happens when love in interrupted by forces of nature no one can control. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are marvelous in this picture. I remember taking a group of my film critic students to a preview screening of this film. They were able to share their thoughts with a representative of the production company who was planning to offer those comments to director David Fincher.  Nominated for 13 Oscars, this film would carry home 3 including visual effects.

3752918,5,B001PO5N6G,"If you don't know how to make a good thing last long, this is the movie you should watch. Not stay young forever, not getting richer everyday, not riding cool motorcycles and watching the sea in every Sunday night. Romance is magical but romance is just hard to last long. It's those little lovely details in your memory make you pity and happy. When something good is happening, cherish it. When something good is about to end, don't swear or cry, just let go. Remember those little things that get you emotinoal and move on like a rational human being. Time always travels fast but sometimes, time does slow down a little bit, and we just need to find that rhythm. Daisy didn't die in Benjamin's arms but who can say that the love between Benjamin and Daisy didn't last long. And I think for most people, that kind of love is long enough.",1426291200,3,840,4.461038961038961

3753054,3,B001PO5N6G,"I think where this film looses out is the interaction of the outside world into the story. It's too 'perfect and predictable' without any challenges that might've helped define the characters and progression a bit better. Alcoholism, racism, crime, depression, drugs, politics, etc. In a way it's nice, this fairy tale love story in a utopian past where all are born, live, and die in serenity and peace. But it's also condescending in a way to mask over what so many of us have learned through history and experience still in our modern lives. Especially when the movie is so long, one would expect a bit more 'umph' with Benjamin's experiences and/or occurrences that happen to people around him. Had the movie lost some flotsam/jetsam and shored down to a two hour frame, I may have given it another star. The nice thing with Criterion is the supplemental disc that painstakingly shows the making of this film. Very eye opening as to getting the story to script, and the script to film. And highly impressive all the CGI and arduous acting from all the cast in front of and behind the camera. But, it still doesn't do anything to bolster the story other than exemplify it was more or less a proving ground to see if all the effects and inserts could work. As a romantic fable, it's a nice story that could've worked just as well with Roger Corman type cheat methods. For a tech geek, it's a fascinating treasure hunt trying to locate the seam lines and digital quirks while ignoring the story. But with Forrest Gump, Big, Charlie, Mask, and Boy In The Bubble already having touched upon Benjamin Button. And/or just watch them in reverse for the same effect - Benjamin Buttons wasn't that special of a story.

Even my little 7yr old boy was glued to the television, watching as this little old baby was held by his adopted mama. Such sympathetic and beautiful characters. And this movie really isn't depressing, it's a beautiful love story. A quirky, different, thought-provoking love story. How hard it must have been for Daisy to watch the father of her child become a child, a toddler, then an infant all the while he had dementia.

I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt, but was struck by how well he transitioned in the phases of reverse aging physically while aging mentally and spiritually.  Cate Blanchett was superb.  I am often struct by the depth of her performances and her range of versatility.  The young woman who adopted Benjamin as an infant was also terrific.

This is a prime example of what you can make with every resource available to you - painstaking VFX, A-list cast, the best cameras, locations, and a fantastic script.  The pacing may be slow (the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5), but it's worth the time investment to allow the story to unfold as it should.",1397088000,,620,4.904761904761905

3753453,4,B001PO5N6G,"The premise of the movie was interesting and my wife and I enjoyed watching it.  However, at the end of the movie, we found ourselves saying that it was a bit slow and did not need to be as long as it was to explain that story.  That is the only reason for the missing fifth star.  I don't believe I should notice how slow a movie is if I am completely enjoying it.  Again, that said, the story was well-told and produced well.",1393459200,2,427,4.0476190476190474

Pitt very deftly handles moving from a young boy in an old man's body, with moments of gentle humor and brilliance, to moments of clarity. I had a tear in my eye at the end of the movie.

3753472,4,B001PO5N6G,"An original/new idea for fiction with that is entertaining.  It does move quite slowly, but that is okay since the characters are well developed.  Many of my friends seemed to think this was somewhat depressing.  it does deal with dealing with life and death especially from the geriatric point of view, so take that into consideration.",1391990400,2,336,4.964285714285714

3753491,5,B001PO5N6G,"I'm only mentioning this because I read it in other reviews prior to watching the movie; something I normally don't do and wish I hadn't.  A correlation was made between this movie and ""Forrest Gump"" and sadly, for me, I was so distracted by that for about the first hour, because I kept trying to find the correlation and couldn't (and I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" at least 100 times; literally).  In any case, I finally gave up on trying and watched the movie on it's on merit.  That correlation, or certain similarities, DID come to me as the movie progressed, but I sincerely believe that had I not read those reviews, I would not have made the correlation otherwise, as I was so wrapped up in THIS story; which stood entirely on it's own.  It was just as equally and uniquely different as ""Forrest Gump"", so I'm not crying over spilled milk, because I absolutely LOVED this movie and plan to watch it over, and over, and over again until my one month streaming rental subscription ends, because that's how much I loved it.  I'm an NOT a professional critic either, just a movie lover.  However, IMHO, this movie was so exquisitely acted (and narrated) by both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett (as always on both counts) as well as the entire cast, and everything from the set designs to the special effects and special effects make-up artistry, to the costumes, lighting, and timing was just perfect in every way.  It is most definitely a bittersweet story, but not one which I found at all depressing as mentioned in another review,  Although I cried many times during the movie, they were indeed both happy and sad tears.  The bottom line is that, in the end, it totally depends on how you look at life and how you deal with it.  If you are cynical or a pessimist, then this movie might well depress you, or you just simply might not enjoy this type of movie.  However, if you have a glimmer of faith, or you believe in fate and that everything happens exactly how and when it's supposed to, or if you're a dreamer, like to fantasize, or you're an optimist, OR if you could ever even begin to imagine living your life in reverse as ""Benjamin"" lived his, then you just might find the beauty in this story.  At least I did.  Wonderful story, wonderful movie, and I don't know why, of the many other awards it did receive, why it did not garner ALL of them!!!

picture:
very good. almost forgot it was shot on digital camera and not film. looks nigh flawless, though. black levels are great and colors are brownish and old-timey; very fitting to the tone of the movie itself. lines are very clear and crisp and detail is magnificent. consistent picture throughout, no signs of edge halos (wouldn't typically get them from movies made this recently).

audio:
great. It's lossless audio from Criterion. it's Criterion, period. trust them.

overall:

The only real objection I had to it was when Benjamin just up decides that he can't be a father to his daughter and abandons his family. That was completely out of character for him. Up until then, he had always been depicted as a devoted family man and somebody in complete acceptance of his condition -- and that everyone around him was in acceptance of his condition. It just didn't make logical sense that he would suddenly take off. Maybe the writers needed him to do that in order to satisfy their outline -- a cardinal sin of storytelling.

Then I watched the movie more recently, in my thirties, and now can appreciate its characters and deliberately slow pace. It is a movie about aging, and therefore is supposed to be thoughtful and slow and even sometimes stale so that the viewer can age with the movie.

I now found the characters both interesting and uniquely fleshed out and flawed, just like real people facing problems with growing old and with a restless yearn to repair certain regrets. I could enjoy this movie because I myself had grown up and experienced regret and guilt and lost dreams. These messages are perfectly conveyed throughout the movie, making it a classic that never grows old.",1374710400,,863,4.746666666666667

3753621,5,B001PO5N6G,"""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: ""I was born under unusual circumstances."" And so begins ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans from the end of World War I in 1918, into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man's life can be.

The cast led by Brad Pitt (in his best performance as Benjamin Button), Cate Blanchett (as Daisy), and Taraji P. Henson (in an excellent performance as Queenie) is excellent! The directing by David Fincher (who also directed ""Alien 3"" (1992), ""Seven"" (1995, his first teaming with Pitt), ""The Game"" (1997), ""Fight Club"" (1999, his second teaming with Pitt), ""Panic Room"" (2002) & ""Zodiac"" (2007) is excellent! The screen story (based on Fitzgerald's short story) by Eric Roth & Robin Swicord (who also wrote the screenplay to ""Little Women"" (1994) & ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" (2005) and the screenplay by Roth (who won the Oscar for his screenplay to ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), he also wrote the story and screenplay to ""The Insider"" (1999), ""Ali"" (2001, screenplay), ""Munich"" (2005, screenplay), & ""The Good Shepherd"" (2006) is excellent!

The music by Alexandre Desplat (who also did the music to ""Syriana"" (2005), ""The Queen"" (2006), & ""The Golden Compass"" (2007) is excellent! The cinematography by Claudio Miranda is excellent! The film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall (who also did the film editing to ""Zodiac"" & ""Panic Room"") is excellent! The casting by Laray Mayfield (who also did the casting to ""Fight Club"", ""Panic Room"", ""Zodiac"", & ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by Donald Graham Burt (who also did the production design to ""Zodiac"") is excellent! The art direction by Kelly Curley, Randy Moore (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""G.I. Joe: Rise Of Cobra"" (2009), & Tom Reta (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Surrogates"" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo (who also did the set decoration to ""Zodiac"", ""Yes Man"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Terminator: Salvation"" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Jacqueline West (who also did the costume design to the upcoming ""State Of Play"" (2009) is excellent!

This is an brilliant and beautiful drama that intrigues and interests you until the very end. This is an outstanding departure for Pitt and Fincher together in their third outing. This is one of the best films of the year.",1369526400,,2628,4.848552338530067

3753624,5,B001PO5N6G,I had to watch this movie for my developmental psychology. I must say that for me as a student I was really impressed how all the stages of development where clearly stated in this movie. Plus the love between Daisy and Benjamin was so inspiring even though they just passed through time. Very lovely movie. I would watch it again,1368489600,,330,4.516666666666667
3753625,4,B001PO5N6G,This is a great movie. It's very interesting. But the length is daunting. It's hard to sit through. It's just so very long.,1367971200,,123,4.391304347826087
3753626,3,B001PO5N6G,"This in my estimate is a 3 1/2 star movie, so if I could give it that here I would have. It's a pretty good movie but not a classic or even a great film. The best part of this film is the first 90 minutes from Benjamin's birth as an old man, and on down untill he reaches maybe his 50's. The film is pretty much exceptional and wonderful during it's first half, but it's less interesting as it moves onward. It is unique, touching, and generally incredible to see Benjamin begin as a small baby and yet have all the characteristics of an old man. The aging effects of the central character are amazing. It is incredible to watch him grow younger, learning who he is, how to walk, and how to cope with his unusual sort of cycle of life. The film is truly great during these segments. Many of the characters following along in this portion of the film are memorable and interesting as well. But by the time Benjamin progresses downward into his 40's and younger, the aging process seems to weaken. Benjamin stays looking between 40 and 20 far too long, but what really doesn't work well is that some of the characters who were in their 30's and 40's during the earlier part of the film don't seem to look as old as they should some 50 years later. The effects people did a very good job at making Brad Pitt look 20 though, It was very convincing. Sadly though the film seems less interesting during it's second half, and it does have too many simularities with Forrest Gump, which in my assesment forces it to take a hit or two here and there. I really felt it was a better than average film and for it's first half deserved to be in Oscar territory.",1367971200,,1648,4.285256410256411

3753660,1,B001PO5N6G,"This is a case of style over substance if I ever saw one, a movie that is all dressed up with no where to go. There is no point and no plot, but everything from the music to the dialog, asks us to suspend our critical thought, and take it on faith that it is as profound as it thinks it is. But then what could we expect from a movie based on nothing but a cute gimmick. ""Hey let's have a guy who gets younger as life goes on"". Everything that happens in this movie is predictable given this premise. For instance, of course he would meet a young girl, fall in love, and have a baby with her when their ages meet. This is in no way profound or interesting, it is just the most obvious gimmick to stack on top of the first one, and unfortunately how the movie would play out was obvious to me after only the first 10 minutes. The next two hours are just painful to watch, as the movie never deviates from the expected path, with no surprises and no depth, but still dripping with hollow emotional cues of false profundity, very much like those of a religious service.

3753694,5,B001PO5N6G,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is about a boy born with the body of an old man. His father abandons him on the steps of a home for the elderly, and a care-taker takes him in as her own. Benjamin grows younger as time goes by, and just like anyone else, experiences things like love, loss, war, and death. The plot chiefly follows Benjamin's life, but the story contains a lot of interesting little pieces of other character's lives. It's sort of a study of people and their lives and how everything flows together.

In between everything else, the film is a love story between Benjamin and Daisy, a young girl he met as an old man. Eventually, their ages meet in the middle, and they begin the relationship they've waited their whole lives to have. This premise might be a little bizarre and off-putting to some, but this is exactly the kind of strange love story, that I can appreciate.

The film moves slowly and quietly. The effects in this movie are subtle, but that is exactly why they are impressive. Those looking for purely a great love story will get it... in time. But if you can appreciate a long, quiet movie about life, with a bit a quirk, this film may be for you. Just get your tissues ready.",1357516800,,1212,4.430493273542601

3753697,5,B001PO5N6G,"What would like be like if you could only grow younger? The Curious Case of Benjamin Button attempts to answer that question in a beautiful & exquisite way.
Without going way into depth - this really is an amazing film.  It succeeds because it brings the content to life in a realistic way that really draws the viewer in.
Even more importantly, there is a lot to be learned from watching this movie.  It is a long meditative film that really makes you think.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was directed by David Fincher & is loosely based on the 1922 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
The film stars Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchett. To keep things simple Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born a very old man. Throughout the film he grows younger.
His love interest is Daisy Fuller (Blanchett).  Its interesting to watch because their love seems very pure.  The characters story is very unique but it seems like an
ordinary love story.  In a sense,  Benjamin Button's life is not that much different from a normal existence. A person is born, they live, they love, and they sail into the abyss.
This is life and the majority of the experience depends greatly on personal perspective.  The movie is long but it is a worthwhile adventure.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a good film for mediative & thoughtful times.",1357257600,,1333,4.57563025210084

Actually emailed Criterion about this and they said there is nothing they can do, so Amazon must be in the same boat.
Anyways, buying Criterion releases is often about extremely geeky library collecting, so what might seem like a very minor or even non-issue ends up sticking out more like a sore thumb. Otherwise a very good addition, but if you are a criterion nerd you might want to try buying it directly from them (I think it was not available when I ordered but has since been restocked.)

Button who starts life as an old man, who travels in the reverse of aging, and his female counterpart played by Cate Blanchett who ages ""normally."" The concept of time and age are intricately woven throughout the movie.  The characters age in their different ways from the 40s up to present day when we learn of the fall of our characters.  However, I have not read the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, so I'm not exactly sure how close it ties to the book.

3753796,5,B001PO5N6G,"THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is stunning.  The story, the acting, the effects, the craftsmanship of the filmmakers--everything hits on all cylinders.  And with the extra features available with THE CRITERION COLLECTION, the viewer learns about the remarkable technology that allowed Brad Pitt to play young (meaning ""old"") Benjamin by digitally placing an animated face on another actor's body.  Then the viewer learns how ""cosmetic"" effects were used to make Pitt and costar Cate Blanchett look much, much younger. The disc containing the special features, where everything is discussed about the film--from its inception to post-production--is actually longer than the film itself, but well worth taking the time to watch.  It's as spellbinding as the haunting tale of Benjamin Button--a person who was born old, and ages backwards through decade after decade of life primarily in New Orleans.  And over the course of the story, some very compelling and interesting characters weave in and out of Benjamin's life in grand fashion.

And what a story!  As director David Fincher advises in a must-see audio commentary, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is not a ""love story"", it's a ""death story.""  As the story begins, we find Cate Blanchett's Daisy character literally on her death bed as Katrina bears down on NOLA.  As she has her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) read aloud from Benjamin's personal diary, the story moves back to New Orleans during World War I, to the dedication of a new clock for the city's train station, whereby Gateau, the blind clockmaker, has installed a clock that runs backwards--""So that all the sons we lost in the war might return to us.""  We then move to the evening of Armistice Day, the night a withered and monster-looking Benjamin is born, with his dazed father (Jason Flemying) literally leaving the newborn on the doorstep of the local old folks' home.  Thus an ancient-looking Benjamin literally grows up surrounded by death, as inhabitant after inhabitant dies, only to be replaced by other inhabitants who die.  Benjamin's childhood may be the best, most entertaining part of a most entertaining film, because all the characters that come into Benjamin's life are so delightful and fun to watch.  (Two of the most compelling characters are Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), Benjamin's adoptive mother, and the hysterical Captain Mike (Jared Harris), who gives adolescent Benjamin his first job on a tugboat, and a most interesting coming-of-age evening.)  Of course it's during his childhood that Benjamin meets 7-year-old Daisy; both are immediately drawn to one another, and as Daisy so wondrously states, they spend the next few years preparing to ""meet in the middle.""

The story moves on from Benjamin's childhood, when he leaves New Orleans at age 17 (yet he looks 60) to adventure on Captain Mike's boat literally all over the world.  Before World War II erupts, he has his first love affair in Russia with Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton is terrific), the wife of an English diplomat, and during the war Benjamin experiences suffering and death as Captain Mike's tugboat is destroyed at sea.  Benjamin returns to New Orleans following the war, and as the years unfold his youthful looks begin to coincide with Daisy's (who is in a ballerina troupe traveling the world), until an injury ends her career, and in her thirties she returns to New Orleans, and Benjamin and Daisy begin their lives together.  There is pending heartbreak because, as Benjamin laments, ""Nothing ever lasts"", and over the decade of the Sixties Daisy ages while Benjamin looks younger; a daughter is born in 1968, and a year later, Benjamin informs his soulmate, ""She needs a father, not a playmate.""  He quietly leaves early one dawn, and we don't find him again until 13 years later, when he shows up unexpectedly at Daisy's dance studio; both Benjamin and Daisy are in their fifties, yet Daisy looks middle-aged, while Benjamin barely looks 20.  There is a brief romantic encounter, then the story doesn't pick up again until Daisy receives a call from Child Services, asking for her assistance with a confused boy who doesn't know who he is.  Daisy moves back to the nursing home and becomes Benjamin's caretaker, until in 2003, appearing as an infant, he dies in Daisy's arms.  So indeed, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a ""death story"", but it is also a rich celebration of life.

THE CRITERION COLLECTION version of this film is enthusiastically recommended.  David Fincher has made a masterpiece, richly detailed and marvelously crafted; THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON could very well be this generation's ""Citizen Kane"".

3753818,4,B001PO5N6G,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is based on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man, born in 1918, who ages in reverse.  Benjamin's baby body looks like an 86-year-old with the same illnesses common to that age.  As the years pass, the body becomes younger.  The film explores the conundrums of this condition, such as  falling in love and fathering a child.  Brad Pitt plays Benjamin simply and admirably, assisted by technology to give him an aged body and by younger actors in closing scenes.  Cate Blanchett plays Daisy, a dancer (she does almost all of her own dancing).  Their love relationship begins when both are adolescents; yet he appears to be an old codger, upsetting Daisy's grandmother.  They are perfectly matched when they are in their forties.  But then a child is born and decisions must be made, as they know Benjamin will become gradually younger.  The story is told in a nursing home in New Orleans in 2005.  Hurricane Katrina is raging as a dying Daisy has her daughter read Benjamin's diary to her.  We see the flashbacks of his jaunt through the 20th century, and Daisy's daughter discovers her identity.

3753838,5,B001PO5N6G,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a drama fantasy film enriched with an enchanting story of love and adventure.

It is a unique account of reverse aging where Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is born with elderly characteristics and comes to know Daisy Fuller (Cate Blanchett) at the nursing home he lives at with his adoptive parents who are on the staff there, and where Daisy visits her grandmother who is a resident.

Pitt and Blanchett have inherent screen chemistry which sees them teamed up again having previously starred together in the 2006 film ""Babel"".

The narrative is multilayered with both Daisy and Benjamin having their own tangents yet they come together and shift apart at several junctions in the movie.

It is a unique film that is very satisfying with a masterfully constructed story.

Video: Criterion is known for stunning, true-to-filmmaker-intent video transfers, and this is no exception. Shot digitally, this movie shows none of that artificial digital flatness, and feature perfect contrast and outstanding color reproduction. The whole thing is razor-sharp, but naturally so, giving an incredibly lifelike image. 10/10.

The sound here is clear and enveloping, with perfect LFE output and surround activity. Dialogue and music are well-prioritized. 10/10.

Special Features: Criterion and David Fincher are both known for providing a wealth of special feature on their releases, and so it is no surprise that release features just that. A massive ammount of special features, all of which are informative and interesting. 10/10.

This DVD set is incredible.  First of all, there is an incredible amount of extras, features/commentary.  In fact, there is a making of type documentary which is worth the price of admission.  It is about as long or longer than the actual movie and really makes you appreciate the movie even more.  It explains how the script knocked around for a long time -- mostly because it would be impossible to film.  Once it was decided that the movie would be made, the process would have be be created as there was no way to actually make the movie (imagine Brad Pitt, 80+ years old, the size of a 7 year old boy).  It's a truly incredible story.  I don't want to explain, but one of my favorite scenes from the movie was filmed on a set, and I had no idea.  The commentary is also excellent.

3753842,5,B001PO5N6G,"This recasts F. Scott Fitzgerald's original (which I have not read) somewhat, but the format works. Here, Benjamin's story appears through diaries, postcards, and reminiscences, many years after his curious death. That adds modern characters and plot to the story, but allows the movie to skip through his life, selecting the scenes that contribute to his curious story.

The basic theme is star-crossed lovers. More accurately, crossed lives, living their lives in opposite directions. They meet when each is just a few years old, but that friendship lasts their lifetime. As each approaches the other from the opposite end of the calendar, though, they have a tragically short time for a normal relationship. Although their relationship has long breaks, they continue it anyway, even when it can't be normal. Parts of this will resonate strongly with anyone who's kept love alive even when bodies and minds fail.

That love pervades this movie. After massive rejection and betrayal in the first hours of his life, Benjamin is surrounded by the most loving people imaginable and by acceptance that requires disbelief to be suspended. (Suspend it, it's worth it.) Queenie, his adoptive mother, exemplifies that best, with a loving devotion that never wavers - no matter what. Daisy loves him equally, but shows more human weakness in bearing the burden of caring for him. Captain Mike and the crew accept him, as do others.

Then, Benjamin looks clearly at the end of life, the failing powers, the lossess, and eventual death. By turning Benjamin's life around, however, this story shows a symmetry between start and end, almost an equation that needs to be balanced. If one word stated the core of this movie, it would be ""acceptance."" This is not just about accepting others, whatever their condition, but accepting the whole of the human condition.

3753868,3,B001PO5N6G,"This story is about a daughter learning about the true origins of her father by being surreptitiously made to read her father's diary. Her father is Mr. Benjamin Button who is ""born under curious circumstances"": born old and aging backwards. Themes of family, the purpose of life, unfulfilled love, fate, end of life and death were principal to the plot with fate being a major element. But the portrayal of key relationships was not sufficient to match the message. Noticeable was the amount 'dark' scenes: there was an air of perpetual night. Overall the story is a wonderful reflection on living, love and relationships. Unfortunately the greater messages of the movie are much undeveloped or contradicting. It was unfortunate that the beauty of the picture was complimented by these incomplete relationships and messages making the movie wonderfully incomplete.

The theme of fate is the source of one of many comparisons to Forest Gump, but unlike Forest Gump a review of destiny is mostly encumbered so as to be disguised. The comparisons are fair considering that the movie is essentially filled with vignettes of key relationships in Mr. Benjamin Button's life and the philosophical, moral and spiritual lessons he adopts from each. His reverse aging almost appears as a secondary or tertiary theme compared to the attempts to philosophy the meaning of living. I would compare this movie to a cross between Forest Gump and A River Runs Through It.

Revealing the summary knowledge and wisdom of these supporting characters often felt manipulated and palpably advertised so as to lose emotional effect. At other times thought provoking message were distracted by titillating interactions. It felt as if `sex' was being use to attract attention to the message which it was obscuring. There was an abruptness to many of the key messages of the film which was in part due to a lack of depth in key relationships. Exemplary of this is the depictions of the relationship of Benjamin with his father. Also curious were the reemerging past relationships which seemed awkwardly placed.
____________________________________
I found many of the messages contradicting. One contradiction was that of accepting ones fate (Artist Captain), but then being unwilling to deal with the consequences of his life by living out his life with the love of his life despite is reverse aging. I found similarities and contradictions in that his daughter was easily made to forgive him for abandoning, something which he was unable to do with his own father. His moral character only stood when he was with the love of his life (Paris Gazebo), otherwise he found little contradiction with using women to fulfill his needs.",1318204800,,2704,5.115384615384615
3753869,5,B001PO5N6G,"I haven't read the book prior to seeing the movie which is something I don't normally do. So, I don't know how faithful this adoption is. However, I really enjoyed watching this film.

The story of Benjamin Button is sweet, different, unique and eventually very sad. I guess that is inevitable for someone who was born very different from the rest of us. I'm not going to retell the plot as I'm sure a lot of reviewers did so masterfully, I'm going to say the reason why I liked this movie despite my distaste for *sad* and *depressing* endings without giving too much away.

What made this story stand out for me isn't just the unique and mysterious circumstances surrounding Benjamin's birth but the moral behind the story. We live in a world that is fascinated with Youth and Beauty so much to the point of obsession. In a world where Cosmetic Surgeries and anti aging products are multi/billion if not trillion trades I think many people with gladly give everything they have/own to be in the shoes of Benjamin Button. Imagine growing Younger instead of older ? Imagine becoming more beautiful and healthy by the day instead of the other way round. I know it is impossible but if it were wouldn't you take it ?

What I like about this film is that it keeps things realistic, It shows the *bad* side of getting younger. The side that the media doesn't show, the side that people don't know about or pay attention to or take for granted. Imagine if you were getting younger and younger by the year and everyone around is getting older. You won't be able to see your kids grow into adults, you won't be able to attend their graduations, school activities, or even weddings because by that time you'll be a child. You won't be able to age gracefully, see your grandchildren or die peacefully in your sleep as an old man/woman. I know many people wouldn't consider dying as an infant in their quest of getting younger but lets face it people aren't immortal and the only way to be forever young is to die in your youth.

Just the idea of retiring to teenage hood and childhood instead of prime age and elderly is very exhausting to me. All the things that you'll have to sacrifice might not be worth it. I'm sure Benjamin Button wished he could be like the rest of his peers and age gracefully instead of the other way round but he had to submit and be content by his share, he rarely if ever complained about it and I admire his character a lot for that. I know there was a lot of implying on it but I was hoping that the author would somehow manage to make poor Benjamin age normally so he could live the rest of his life with the woman he loves and watch his daughter grow but still I couldn't complain because despite it being sad and depressing it does reflect the message it is trying to send.

The Cast choice is perfect (IMO) I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt but this has to be one of my favorite movies by him along with Seven Years in Tibet. Cate Blanchett is a superb actress and I really liked her role here. This is the second Pitt/Blanchett collaboration and I liked it better than Babel.

I recommend this movie for anyone who likes drama or is looking for something different. As long as you don't mind the somehow depressing ending it shouldn't be a problem however if you are looking for an action packed film with swashbuckling Brad Pitt then Oh, well you'll be greatly disappointed.",1316390400,,3395,4.4326923076923075

3753871,2,B001PO5N6G,"In some ways, despite its Oscar nomination for best picture, this was quite the disaster. Though the acting is good, and the set design and cinematography lovely, the problem lies in the changes to the original short story it was taken from, which was profound and eloquent, and often hilarious, particularly in the story's opening pages, where we meet Benjamin born as a full-sized old man, with all his cranky faculties in tact :-) Why the filmmakers decided to abandon the original ideas of the classic story and create a BB character that, to my way of thinking, seemed like one of the most boring and lifeless persons (personality-wise) to ever occupy the screen, I'll never know. And the movie is slow. Not that I mind slow in the least; some of my favorite films are slow in a beautiful, mesmerizing way, just not this kind of slow.

Firstly, it's photography and soundtrack re awesome, inpiring and fitting the context of the movie perfectly.
By the way, context is the word to describe this movie: with dozens of references to real life, the movie manages to use this to make it even more realistic and touching.
The main point discussed in it is how ""nothing lasts"". And, again, the word ""context"" shall be remembered: the movies manages to make you FEEL the ephemerallity of life and pass on its message awesomely.

3753907,4,B001PO5N6G,"`The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is a long, but compelling film that probably has one of Brad Pitts's best performances to date. Following the life of Benjamin Button who is born old and gets younger as the years go by, the story is certainly unique. You see how he deals with aspects of his `affliction' and the various relationships he forges throughout his life, as well as the experiences that colour his life and personality. Cate Blanchett is also excellent in this film and the interaction between her and Benjamin is poignant and touching. The special effects are pretty good but in no way detract from the story being told and the make-up is exceptional. This film has a very gentle, almost sedate, pace to it, which makes some portions drag slightly, but nothing excessively so and the original storyline keeps you engrossed when normally your attention may waver. It also has a positive message about life, without ramming it down your throat, which only adds to it's charm. This isn't an all action film and is very much story driven and some may disappointed by that. But as long as you are aware that this a long film, that requires some concentration, then you will be in for a treat and a spellbinding fairytale. Well worth a viewing and it should put those Brad Pitt doubters in their place too.

3753911,5,B001PO5N6G,"There are magical movies, movies that enthrall you, capturing your soul and mind. This is the story of Benjamin Button, who was born with several aging diseases and experiences a unique life journey, opposed to what we know: Benjamin was born an old man, and as he grows up he becomes younger and younger until he completes a full life circle. Meanwhile, his family and friends are all getting old and, with the exception of the love of his life, Daisy, all die.

Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors' home. The movie opens with the last day of the Great War, and finishes with Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. With Benjamin we witness scenes from the Second World War, the 1960s (Beatles), New York Ballet, race relations in New Orleans. Benjamin Button is played by six different actors, mainly by Brad Pitt.

At the core this is a love story between Benjamin and Daisy, played by three actresses, mainly by Cate Blanchett who gives yet another superb performance. Benjamin, while away getting younger, had a short love affair with Elizabeth Abbott, played by another wonderful British actress, Tilda Swinton. There are many touching moments that touch your heart, but the most touching one is when Benjamin decides to leave his lover, and his one-year-old daughter, before she will be able to remember him. He wanted his daughter to have a real father, not one who grows to become a child as his daughter grows older.

David Fincher directed this movie with sensitivity and silky imagination. Alexandre Desplat's music is enchanting and moving. It's a beautiful score that promotes the many magical moments you experience while watching this long movie, 2:40 hours, yet I found myself hoping that the movie would never end.

  An ill-consieved story, tedious and unwatchable, the drippy sentimentality was supposed to mask the fact that there was no plot,ethics, nor any real reason to stay with it except to watch Brad's face change.
  What ever goofy Zen message was buried under all that glitsey prattle was obviously waisted on me. I don't think I am alone in my disdain, or the resale value of this Oscar winning New Age Classic would at least equal the cost of the postage it takes to order it.
  As with so many vacuous new multi-million dollar spectacles, every one was asking how they would do it, or what they would do. But no body ever seems to ask if they should do it at all. Kind of like setting off the first nuke.
  There was concern about whether or not they might just set fire to Earth's atmosphere and sterilize the whole ball. That would have ended WW2,I suppose. Nobody knew what a nuke would do. Now I am not saying that a Hollywood bomb is as bad as a nuke in your neighborhood. But a film like Ben Button is just about as welcome.

3753915,5,B001PO5N6G,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Curious Case..."" for many reasons, which I will detail below.  Unlike the film, I'll try to keep it brief!

First, Eric Roth wrote another great screenplay. Or perhaps should I say, he dusted off his fabulous screenplay for ""Forrest Gump,"" changed the names (if not some of the places), and voila! Another wonderful, allegorical romp through an imaginary world where personal character is the most important thing. The parallels between the two screenplays are amazing, and it makes for a fun evening to invite your friends over for dinner, then spend a few hours trying to see who can come up with the most parallels (Louisiana, strong mother figures, no/weak father figures, strong african americans, overcoming handicaps, fighting in the war, hummingbirds & feathers, boats, running odd businesses, emotionally vapid lead male character, beautiful ephemeral female lead who returns after travelling the world to have a baby with male lead, etc. etc.).

What I love about Eric Roth is how he completely suspends reality in order to get at what is most real (and important), such as character, perseverence, family, and caring for other people.

Clearly Brad Pitt was directed to suspend personality in the portrayal of his role. In retrospect I feel better now about how Tom Hanks portrayed Gump, because Hanks was able to suspend being normal, without suspending Gump's feelings.

Cate Blanchette was fantastic. She is sooo good. Wow is she talented. Oops, I said I'd keep my comments brief. At times all I could do is stare at her stunning, handsome face, born to convey raw grit, power, and determination with etherial grace. She is one of those women who will never be pretty, but will always be more attractive than all the other women in the room - even those who are thirty years her junior. Like Robin Wright in ""Gump,"" she was very worthy of the role, and elevated the visual beauty of the film. But I think in ""The Curious Case...,"" Cate also filled the personality gap left by Brad.

I was a tad disappointed by a few things. When ""Benjamin"" gets.... old ...eh, young, ... I mean, when he comes to the end of his life, why did he shrink back into a baby? Since he came in as a tiny old man, I would have expected him to go out as a huge baby. Oh well, that wouldn't have been as pretty as that beautiful little baby.

I could only see two flaws in the screenplay (which is two more than I found in ""Gump""). First, why did ""Benjamin"" come into the world with some wisdom and poise, and leave with so little? It should have been the other way around.

Second, if the movie is about character, loyalty, and family, why then does ""Benjamin"" abandon his family when they need him the most? Instead of being with them, we see scenes of him traveling across the globe, through Tibet (another Pitt movie...), China, etc. on a motor cycle. Yes, I was watching when he told ""Daisy"" that he didn't want to be a burden on her or the child. But I didn't buy it. It was totally out of character, and contrary to what I saw as the point of the movie.

Oh well. Add it all up, and it was still a great way to spend nearly three hours. Much better than the other alternatives being offered in my local sixteen screen mega-movie house.

I hope Eric Roth keeps writing. But I hope its about something entirely different next time.",1289174400,,3350,4.615126050420168
3753926,5,B001PO5N6G,"Seeing there are already quite a few ""in depths"" reviews, I don't want to go into details except to say that I think it's a great story and makes one think. Personally, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't matter if you're born young or old - either way, we have to go through the same trials of life. You're helpless when you're born as a baby and, if you live to a ripe old age, you usually end up being helpless again. (I live in a senior cummunity and see it happen every day).

3753931,1,B001PO5N6G,"I had my reservations about Benjamin Button, based on its fairy-tale plot; yet a man aging backwards while still being able to hold onto his childhood sweetheart was a compelling enough story for any skeptic.  That plus a Brad Pitt / Cate Blanchet casting, thirteen academy award nominations, and downright curiosity compelled me to watch this with high expectations.  But a quarter of the way into the movie, when I realized I would prefer watching a documentary on Watergate to this romantic fairy-tale, my expectations were dashed.  Yes, it is not a good day when I prefer Richard Nixon to Brad Pitt.

Not even its Forrest Gump and Titanic reminders were enough to revive the long and drawn out plot that failed to reveal anything new about its mysterious main character.  Like Forrest Gump and the Titanic, its theme of an untimely love story surviving the test of time is apparent.  Unlike the two earlier films, however, there was little action or humor to sustain the test of time and nothing real to hold it together.  Though fictional, the Titanic centered around a real life, highly dramatic tragedy, while Forrest Gump humorously interacted with major historical events, without altering them one bit.

Benjamin Button, on the other hand, centered around a fictional train station clock, created by a man who wished to turn back the hands of time to return his military son back from the dead.  What this man and his clock had to do with Benjamin Button was not explained, except that Button was born the moment World War I had ended.  He was born an infant with an old man's face and body ailments, but was he the clock maker's reincarnated son or just a casualty of the clock's spell?  Unlike a locket thrown back to sea, or a feather falling from the sky, the clock's connection to our hero wasn't clear and provided little closure to a not so well-rounded story.

The clock came down near the end of Benjamin's life, but before he reached an infantile state.  Now consistent with his birth, Ben should have been the height of an old man with a baby's face when he died.  Instead, he was a perfectly normal looking baby who must have shrunk down in size considerably.  This did not make sense since he wasn't born the size of an adult.  Even fairy-tales need to hold onto some logic.

In spite of its incomplete connections, the original story, makeup, special effects, costumes, and acting gave the film some merit - but not enough to pass the test of time, not even for the duration of the film.",1285632000,8,2511,4.670454545454546

What came to mind immediately when I realized what was going on was PROGERIA, a rare progressive genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly? I'd watched a few documentaries on it over the past few years, and what happened to Benjamin Button seemed to be the reverse. That could have been a contributing factor to the unsettling emotions it elicited.

As bizarre as the situation was, the story held your attention from beginning to end. The acting was outstanding. The emotions that surfaced were bountiful. It really made you stop and think...about life, people, love, those that are different then us.

Cate Blanchett (bless her heart), as an old woman, gives an uncommonly bad performance that borders on parody. The aging backwards thing is a gimmick which adds nothing to the film. The dialogue and screenplay are the films biggest faults. The screenplay does not have an original idea in its silly head (but plenty of cliches). The dialogue is hammy and unnatural sounding; the film's attempts to be profound fail miserably. The exploration of death is unoriginal; this territory was infinitely better explored in Six Feet Under. What can I praise about this film? Swinton is superb as usual and the only interesting character. Pitt gives a good and convincing performance, even though his character is very bland. The film looks very pretty and the special effects are excellent. None of these things come close to compensating for the films weaknesses though.

Edit: I did not find this film depressing at all since I felt no emotional involvement in what was going on. The screenplay was written by Eric Roth who also wrote Forrest Gump, another monumentally overpraised movie (which is condescending and intelligence insulting as well).",1283385600,16,1226,5.099502487562189

It didn't really work b/c you could almost hear the Hollywood execs in the background asking for a hit that would be as successful as ""Forrest Gump.""  All of the story & style elements were there, so you can see how it passed muster with the guys in the back room.

1. It is told in a narrative that is identical to the Forrest Gump approach and the main characters have a southern drawl
2. It has a ""Mama"" figure in it, that pretty much serves the same function as the Sally Field role. She raises her misfit son, loves him unconditionally, says ""you never know what's comin' after you"" (aka ""box of chocolates, never know what you're going to get, etc.) and she dies.
3. There is time spent on the seas with a crusty ""Lieut Dan"" type of character
4. Benjamin writes his love interest all the time from everywhere like FG
5. Cate Blanchett character even says ""I gotta go pee"" like FG does
6. There is no reason why the Cate Blanchett character would be that drawn to BB as the love of her life-- not to mention the notion that she comes across as somebody who is not into guys anyway.

But still, I never heard of a case where someone starts old and dies young.

3753953,1,B001PO5N6G,"Ouch. I never thought I'd be giving a DAVID FINCHER movie a rating under 3 stars. As it turns out... you really never should say ""never"".

Like I said, I love Fincher. I watched this movie primarily for the fact that he directed it. That, AND the fact that Cate Blanchett is in it. Had Blanchett not been in it, it would have been a zero star rating, if I could give it that!!!

The movie was bad right from the start. First off, the old lady was so over-acted and WAY over exaggerated. I have NEVER heard an old woman talk like that before, and I was there when my Grandmother (on my mom's side) was sick in the hospital. Add the obligatory Hurricane Katrina reference to that and, yep, it was clear this was going to be one VERY bad movie. Should you encounter a start as bad as this, I ask that you eject the disc from the player, drop it in a bucket of ice-cold water, and call the poison control, as you have something very toxic on your hands!

The plot was rubbish for two reasons: One being that it was just a remake of Forrest Gump. Ferchrissake, it was written by the same screen writer! Another being that it was just nonsensical, despite it sounding interesting. For starters, he is a FREAK. He was born an old man. He was adopted. He should have had a rough life but no, he has it all wonderful and what not. There were several parts where I just fell on the ground and flailed around laughing because it was just so hokey and over-the-top.

The BIGGEST problem with the plot was that there was not enough conflict. I mean, come on, this movie is almost three hours long, and whatever conflict there is, it gets resolved in 2 minutes. This got on my nerves. Come on, with the whole ""Midnight lover with Tilda Swinton"" and ""Pursuing Daisy"" story, there should be a conflict. Simply put, there isn't. It got on my nerves.

The movie is simply WAY TOO LONG too. Come on, it runs 167 minutes. The same story could have been told in about TWO hours or less! But no, Fincher had to overflow it with so much unnecessary crap (like the Tilda Swinton plot) and 5 minute shots.

Oh the ending was lame too. Come on you drag the plot out for THAT LONG and then suddenly try to end with the *GROOOOAAAANNN* inducing ""Some are mothers, some dance, some get struck by lightning"" lameness. Way to rush the ending to a very unnecessarily long and slow paced movie. Can someone also tell me why the humming bird was important??? I was just face-palming when it appeared at the end.

By the time the movie was over, I just left the theatre feeling depressed and sick. Come on, too much lame-ness and bleakness, it wasn't even uplifiting-depressing, it was just plain draining and depressing.

Scott Fitzgerald short story, the producers, directors and actors brought an astounding presentation to the big screen.  Brad Pitt, of course, did an amazing job with his portrayal of Benjamin Button, but then Brad Pitt could just stand there and look gorgeous and I would say he was magnificent, no matter what the movie was about.  Cate Blanchett, as Daisy, the woman he was destined to love forever, was his perfect co-star.

Yes, the premise of the movie is odd in that a baby (Benjamin) is born in the unlikely state of an eighty-year-old man with severe health issues, who then grows younger, healthier and more handsome as each year passes by, but I found so many similarities between this story and real life.  You know...all that Cougar stuff - older woman with a younger man - and even the older man with the younger woman, which is more common.  A mother's love for her child was also played out in several different scenarios.

I'm a sucker for tear-jerker movies that bring to the screen the true emotions of real life, though, so this one was right up my alley.  My only complaint was that many of the scenes were just too dark...not enough lighting or something...or maybe I need to adjust the brightness and contrast on my television screen.  Other than that, I thought it was an absolutely brilliant screenplay.  If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you do.  It is well worth your time.",1275696000,,2339,4.958974358974359
3753956,4,B001PO5N6G,"When this film was released it struck me as having a silly premise and I had no interest in seeing it.  I was surprised when it was nominated for several Oscars.  When I signed up for Netflix I put it in my queue and then forgot about it until it arrived in the mail. It is a beautiful film to watch - the sets and costumes were so effective that the history flowed flawlessly. The story is well known in general, but while watching it I never had that exasperating feeling that I knew exactly what would happen next. The dialogue was well written, which is not true of a lot of films.

For some reason I wasn't emotionally drawn into the story - but I think to some degree that is because when you watch a film at home it's easy to get distracted with other things.",1275264000,,766,4.162162162162162

3753958,4,B001PO5N6G,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a collection of interesting vignettes about a guy aging backwards. Some are touching like the clockmaker's heartache and Benjamin's relationship with Queenie, his adopted mom. Some are beautiful like the love affair in Murmansk and his lifelong relationship with Daisy. Some are thrilling like the episode of U-boat warfare on the high seas. And some are relatively humdrum. But in the end, it just doesn't come together as whole cloth. Good entertainment? Yes, for the most part. The core of the movie is a love story between Benjamin and Daisy. But it's hard to draw any deep inspiration or significant meaning from something so whimsical, so deliberately random. I'm giving it 4 stars, 3 stars overall plus 1 star extra credit for acting, set design, and special effects.

Capable of provoking both laughter and tears, but a heavy movie with more sadness than joy.  Not recommended as a feel-good movie, but recommended as a thought-provoking entertainment and/or stimulator of conversation.

3753961,4,B001PO5N6G,"The film has a lot going for it. For one, most of it takes place in Old New Orleans (my home town for awhile) and you can't go wrong--provided you capture the flavor (which I feel the movie did). It has 3 fantastically popular & attractive ""stars"" (and I must confess I haven't seen much of their work, particularly Brad Pitt's.) It has a great overall cast too. The African-American actors were particularly effective I thought. And, of course, it has a very mysterious & unlikely storyline.

On the debit side, the movie was too long for what it had to offer (or failed to suggest in the script). I think 15 mins. could have been deleted--and my aim would be the whole scenario about modern dance. Not cut completely, but cut nonetheless.

It was sort of funny that Tilda Swinton should be in this age-generation-bending little epic, considering her own role in ORLANDO where she not only age-bent, but gender-bent as well. I like her, but was not particularly keen about her Moscow scenes. There was just something superficial about them--not her--them.

So far I have not seen a Brad Pitt film where I could say, Wow, he's a really good actor; but as I said, I've only seen a few movies he was in, but not really ""starred"" in. This film didn't help because so much of his character depended upon technicalities (make-up, special effects, etc.) over technique (as in acting). As to his physical beauty, that was really only featured in a short scene with Cate Blanchett (my own reigning diva at the moment.) Sorry, girls...you're in luck, though, if you like tiny little old men.

I found the production interesting enough to see it twice in a row. I was mesmerized by the early scenes--and LOVED the big scene at the revival meeting. The little Benjamin was really, really cute & great to watch. These were the best scenes I felt. They caught the (inter-racial) mood of turn-of-the-century New Orleans. I noticed another reviewer had a problem with how the father was portrayed in the movie rather than in the book. A major reason to have read it first because there was something that just didn't click or ring true about it for me either.

Finally, what I will remember most about the film is the music--it was wonderful, perfect. Sometimes you could barely hear it, then at the appropriate spot it would amplify ever so gently--like a music box or from an old time circus. It was one of the best movie scores I've heard lately. Whimsical, mystical, magical to compliment the theme.

Despite the lack of the 5 Star rating, I know I'll watch the movie again...maybe even tonight (it's a rainy, stormy night--lightening & all, perfect night for a sweet fantasy.)

3753963,4,B001PO5N6G,"Perhaps once or twice in a year, a movie comes along which can be described as lyrical. This is definitely one for 2008. Somehow the whole feel of the movie reminded me of watching ""The New World"" the brilliant work from Terence Mallik. Apart from having a love story as the crux, their plotlines have nothing in common. The similarity is more to do with the narrative and the willingness look more closely at the human condition than breeze over it.

David Fincher is a master craftsman. His body of work is standing testament to his abilities. Last year's underappreciated 'Zodiac' was probably one of the best films of the year. Fincher gives a demonstration in how the narrative has to adapt to the storyline. Zodiac was edge of your seat thriller (not in the conventional sense) but here he allows us to get up close and personal with Benjamin, Daisy and Quinny.

The cast is incredible. Fincher's attention to detail is evident when he has cast a terrific Julia Ormond in a minor role. Lot many drectors may have cast a lesser actress. Cate Blanchett is someone who elevates herself in every movie I have seen. She seems to constantly strive to find that extra dimension to her characters. Her Daisy evolves beautifully throughout the film not just due to brilliant special effects but also due to the way Miss Blanchett refines it with age. Taraji P Henson agan proves she is a force to be reckoned with after ""Hustle & flow"".

Then of course Brad Pitt. Most of the time his acting is effortless. It almost seems as if he is playing is cool collected self. But he really blossoms as the love story between him and Daisy picks up steam. He portrays a lovely blend of tenderness with the increasing confidence of a man getting younger.

If you are someone who has found him/herself losing track of time looking at a painting or any kind of art, this movie is for you. Because real art is not something you gobble up. It is more sedate approach of savouring every morsel until its real beauty strikes you deep within. This movie is just that.",1266710400,,2046,4.581967213114754

3753979,5,B001PO5N6G,"I hate to sound so pretentious in my review title. But, if you think this movie is slow, the characters undeveloped, exc., you don't get the main message of the film. As we get older, Benjamin's life story becomes more meaningful. We eventually understand the complexity of Benjamin's situation. If Benjamin is flat as a character, you are not already engrossed in the message of the film. If you were, Benjamin's flatness would be reinterpreted as confounded acceptance of a world none of us can begin to understand. Benjamin in not so much a character, he is representative of that dilemma we all face: what has our experience of the world prepared us for, and why do we never seem prepared for ""what's coming for us""?
  Benjamin ages backward--he is born old and gets younger, stronger, and more beautiful as time goes by. Almost all of us dream of such a turn of events. We all say: I wish I could have been wise and knowledgeable in my prime--we all want to combine the strength of our teens and 20s with the knowledge of our 30s, 40s, 50s, exc. Benjamin is able to achieve this. At 60 years of age Benjamin is ravishingly young, fit, and beautiful--and he already has the experience of a lifetime! However, Benjamin's blessing is also his curse and he finds himself still separated from everyone, still blindsided by the events and revelations of life.
  If you don't find life ""curiously"" astounding and unpredictable, if you think that, somehow, your ""experience"" has prepared you for ""what's comin"", then please don't bother with this movie.

3753981,5,B001PO5N6G,"Let me preface this review with the fact that our family has a connection to the New Orleans culture and lifestyle; my in-laws live in Baton Rouge and live the quintessential southern lifestyle, so watching this reminds me and my husband of our all-too-infrequent trips down South.  Watching this movie transports you to so many places during so many eras:  New Orleans of course, but also WWI & WWII, France, New York, the Florida Keys, Russia, Pitt's post-college-esque journey around the world; any person who likes culture and travel would enjoy it.  I'm particularly fond of southern culture so it has extra appeal in that aspect.

The casting is sublime and while I enjoyed Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson and Tilda Swinton, I think Brad Pitt made the movie; the transformation from decrepit man to the handsome man we met in movies such as Seven Years in Tibet was amazing.  The fact that he is largely known for his looks makes the subtle humor that much funnier.  He is absolutely pitch perfect at portraying a ""teenager"" coming home past curfew after his drunken night at a brothel or as a young boy playing with army men or listening to bedtime stories.

The makeup and cinematography were nothing short of spectacular.  I was shocked to discover that the bed-ridden dying woman at the beginning actually is Cate Blanchett; I was sure it was another (much older) actress.  I want the secret serum they used on both Pitt and Blanchett to remove 20 years from their already beautiful faces.

We enjoyed the intertwining of a classic story with real-world events of today; having Hurricane Katrina as the prelude to the main story gives the movie an air of tangibility that would otherwise be lacking.

We own maybe 20 movies; this will most certainly be another.  The recurring themes:  aging, death, love and enjoying the journey of life are not as heavy as they may sound.  It simply describes life as a course to be run, regardless of the bumps in the road.  I particuarly like the refreshing notion that there is nothing wrong with old age.

While a bit long (2:45), I never found myself bored and saw it in the theatre and a few times since.  It covers so many eras that it feels more like 10 chapters in a longer novel rather than one long monotonous story plot that drones on.",1262995200,,2293,4.678304239401497
3753982,4,B001PO5N6G,"Running time: 2 hrs. 45 min.  Rated PG-13.
  The movie begins with a dying old woman, Daisy (Cate Blanchett), in the hospital as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She askes her daughter, Caroline (Julia Ormond,) to get her the dark suitcase. This suitcase is filled with many personal keepsakes that are dear to the woman and now is the time to share them with her daughter. She asks Caroline to read from the diary she has kept.
  The diary begins with a baby being born at the end of the first Great War. His father, Thomas (Jason Flemyng) runs home to his wife (Joeanna Sayler) whom has just given birth, but soon dies afterwards. Thomas, seeing that the baby is deformed, runs off with the newborn out of the house and leaves it on the backstairs of the home of Queenie Jamison (Taraji P. Henson), a black womam who takes care of other borders, mostly seniors. She takes pity on the baby as it is born looking old. She names the baby, Benjamin.
  At 5-years old, Benjamin is still an old man with a child's body. It is difficult for him to walk because of the disease he was born with.
  In 1930, Mrs. Fuller (Phyllis Somerville) notices Benjamin is walking straight up and looking younger. She jokes that it must be some kind of elixir he is taking. [Best line in the film].
  She introduces Benjamin to her granddaughter, Daisy.
  By the time he is a teenager, we notice that he really was a baby born of a miracle. His face becomes younger-looking every year as well as his body begins to develop biologically younger.
 At the age of 17, as he takes his first job aboard the tugboat Chelsea, we are taken on a journey of his life in this epic movie nominated for a record 13 Academy Awards, but only a winner of 3 Awards for Art Direction, Visual Effects and Make-up.

Also in the cast: Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Tilda Swinton, Edith Ivey, Ed Metzger.

  In real-life, their are children who are born with Hutchinson-Gilford disease that causes premature aging in the young children in facial appearance and atrophy of muscles and skin. It is a very rare condition. They are not expected to live a long life.
  For the sake of this movie, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), the plot of being born old and biologically growing younger is merely just fantasy for story-telling for this film.

3753983,2,B001PO5N6G,"This shows the narrow line between success and failure in drama. The same writer had a mammoth hit with Forrest Gump. Despite some critical mauling the paying public loved it because the viewer cares about the three major characters right from the start.

In Button you have exactly the same three major characters of a man, his mother and his 'girl'.But the viewer never comes to care about the characters. I did not find the film too long - far from it , I was waiting for some of the relationships to be filled out. I was quite happy with the whole idea of a life lived backwards; that is quite an original idea but the writer and director seemed to think that the idea would be enough  for us. They seemed to be saying ""This is a large scale Hollywood film - we have thrown money, special effects and lots of make-up at this film. Enjoy!"".

The weakest part in the film relates to Button's adoptive mother. She simply disappears onto the cutting room floor along with almost all of the part of her real daughter, Button's sister. What was that all about?

 Kate Blanchett plays the life out of Button's love but we do not understand her fascination for him and early in the film this is very creepy. It is quite inconceivable that her daughter would not have been told all about her bizarre father repeatedly through her life, rather than finding out the truth at her mother's death bed. Scenes to which Hurricane Katrina has been added for no reason whatsoever.

Brad Pitt plays Button with great reserve. Worked for Hanks in 'Gump', leaves us cold here. The narrow line between success and failure is defined by the plot and script. We are asked to believe that Button abandons the love of his life so she will not see him 'grow young'. Not anyone's idea of true love. The episodes in Button's life; the endless tugboat scenes, the pointless Tilda Swinton scenes in Russia are never remotely engaging. Maybe Roth thought that the post Vietnam war Shrimp Boat scenes in Gump could be replicated. Mentioning Vietnam reminds me that the success of Gump was in getting the audience to come to terms with American history over 40 years from the 1950s. Button takes a similar broad brush to the history of the world from 1917 to the 1960s but this history is never connected to the story and sometimes the settings look decidedly wrong. Did New Orleans really have happy race relations between the 2 World Wars??

So, sorry Oscars, this is a bit of a clunker. Why not try a Director's Cut;see if we can get involved a bit...",1262476800,6,2524,4.546255506607929
3753984,4,B001PO5N6G,"Getting the DVD is great since watching a two-plus hour movie does require a pause button on occasion.  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fascinating look into the life of a man who is aging backwards.  Interestingly, that aspect of the movie is a bit underplayed.  The movie centers around a woman who is dying on her hospital bed, her daughter who is coming to realize who her father actually is, and a howling Hurricane Katrina right outside their door.

The flashbacks ensue and are wonderfully correographed.  I enjoyed the shadow and light, almost like a silent movie in its rendition.

The movie starts with a man who invents a clock that goes backwards, placed in a train station.  The implication was that at its creation, its effects upon one man, Benjamin, were to be prophetic.  The movie is a bit overly long.

There are several great scenes:  being taken for a walk and made to fend for himself when he is only 7 (but looks 87).  The preacher who tells him to walk.  The first time his biological father attempts to abandon him as ""a monster.""  Benjamin's first visit to a brothel.  His World War II experience on a tug boat.  The elusive hummingbird and what he means.  Well, I guess that's better than a raven.  :)

The movie in many ways is rather ordinary, especially the second half, with Cate Blanchett competently playing the woman in his life, who find and takes care of Benjamin as he gets younger, and younger.

The director did this movie well, with special effects, lots of aging make-up, but did not play this fantasy unrealistically.  There were even parts that made me cry.  Hate that!

The special effects and music are wonderful as well. The film is rather long, clocking in at over two hours, but it does not seem to drag on as other films of similar length do.

The story of a man growing younger not older is told beautifully.

The film is about life, loss, love, forgiveness and choices.  Brad Pitt was a perfect fit for this role and he plays this character with so much truth.  His performance was truly moving.

A  baby born with all the characteristics of an aged man, and abandoned by his widowed father, is not expected to live. But live he does.  In a twist on the normal aging process, he ages chronologically, but physically he ages backwards, becoming younger, healthier and fabulously good-looking until he reaches old age and the transformation is complete.

Most people comment about the amazing technological effects of accomplishing this physical transformation, but what gripped me was the outstanding acting.  Pitt is mesmerizing in this role and it is too bad he did not win an Oscar for this performance.  How he lives his life, old, disabled or in the prime of youth is inspiring. It speaks to one's will and the power to overcome any obstacles.  His character's curiosity to learn as much about the world is also moving: no matter where he is or what he does, he seems to fit.

3754004,4,B001PO5N6G,"In most cases, I prefer the book over the movie but in this case I preferred the movie version of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It is a modernized version of the book and I liked that it took the story to a deeper level that the book in short story form did not. The premise of the movie is loosely based on the book but has taken more creative liberties to expand on themes and events that didn't occur in the book. In the movie, Benjamin is born as an old white man and ages backwards but is not raised by his family and instead is abandoned at a home for the elderly and is essentially raised by a loving and nurturing black woman who lives and works there. Benjamin fits into this environment and new family well and develops relationships and an understanding of what happens as one ages normally. Benjamin is played by Brad Pitt who does a fabulous job and is easy on the eyes to watch as he gets younger. A love story and beautiful relationship develops with Cate Blanchett's character that shows their relationship and the short years that they were able to be a family and have a normal relationship. I didn't like how they ended the movie and how Benjamin chooses to live his life as he ages into infancy. This movie isn't a love story but more of a story about death and aging.

I believe that the book and the movie are about life, death and aging. Both are about finding our place in the world however we come into the world and managing to make the best of that experience.

3754019,5,B001PO5N6G,"This is a long, slow movie, but it is quite astonishing.

At first, there is a little smugness at the general concept: a man is born old and grows younger with time.

But the movie quickly transcends its gimmick-premise, and becomes by turns tragic, and touching, and illuminating, and funny, and amazing, and quietly wonderful.

Brad Pitt's quiet performance is a perfect counterpoint to Cate Blanchett's hyper frenzy.  You can see how these two attract each other.  You can also see how Button (Pitt) would be attracted to the unfulfilled, still-waiting, always-wanting-to-conquer-the-Channel character played by Tilda Swinton.

He himself is also waiting, for something neither he nor anyone else can envision.

And so the movie works subtly to give a powerful sensation of what it feels like to be alive: things happening that are profound, moving, silly, heartbreaking, wonderful, sad, ordinary, unexpected, shocking--all coming into your life, and then moving away like a ship on the horizon.

The fact that the two principal characters' life-arcs are opposite--Blanchett getting older and more sedate, Pitt getting younger and more lively--and can only meet for a touching, tragic moment, is both terribly romantic and exactly right.

This is the way things work.  Nothing lasts.

But, as the lightning-victim says, every day things come along that make it wonderful to be alive.

A profound, interesting, very unusual movie.

It is also quite tricky.  There are subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, hints of reincarnation (the hummingbird).  But, very satisfyingly, the whole plot is shifted forward in time and ends with the cataclysm of Hurricane Katrina slamming into New Orleans, destroying, or seeming to destroy, this entire cycle of death-and-rebirth.

- life and death
- living life to the fullest no matter your age
- falling in love

You will feel as if you are trapped forever in an ever-changing, but somehow, never-changing time warp of pseudo-profound revelations, full of sound bites and fury, signifying nothing--because nothing is what this movie is all about. Really. Absolutely nothing. Not even Brad Pitt imitating Tom Hanks imitating a Georgia cretin could save this film. And that's saying a lot.

Now that I mention it, Queenie's ""You never know what's comin' at ya"" sounds an awful lot like ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.""

First of all, let me start with the positive aspects of the film. It is technically brillant. The scenes with Tilda Swinton(always good) in Russia were excellent--wish there had been more of them.

Now for the negative:

1. I read that the director was intent on not making an overly sentimental film--big
  mistake considering the subject matter. For example--when Benjamin finally dies
  as a baby--Daisy doesn't even shed a single tear. I know an argument can be made
  that she lost him a long time ago as he became ""younger"" and senility crept in.
  But even so, when you finally do lose the love of your life. why not look at him
  and say ""goodbye"" and cry a little--as he is gone forever?

2. The chemistry between Benjamin and Daisy was curiously lacking. When they finally
  ""meet in the middle"" and have a life together--why not show more scenes of them
  being happy and what attracted them to one another? The early childhood scenes
  were touching---but---we as an audience needed more to convince us they really
  were in love.

3. The hospital scenes went on and on and on. Some serious editing was clearly
  needed here. I always hated when we left the main story to go ""back"" to the
  hospital story--except for the parentage revealing scene.

4. Brad Pitt seemed to be ""walking through"" his role. I know he was nominated for
  an Academy Award for this--but this is not his best role. Probably not his
  fault---the fault lies within the screenplay--as we never ""connect"" with
  Benjamin.

More along the lines of a chic flick, it was not as entertaining as it could have been if Benjamin was a bit more mischievious as he's been known to be in other movies.  It's one of those movies where the dialog drops to faint whispers so you have to crank up the volume all the way and get blown out of your seat when the scene changes to blasting music.

If so, please be sure to come to this movie with an open mind and an open heart.  This movie sets its sights high and aims to transport you, so you need to be willing to go on the journey.

More specifically, like any truly great movie, this one succeeds in faithfully portraying a substantial range of the breadth and depth of the human experience.  We thus get to know all sorts of archetypally-significant characters from various walks of life, we witness a diverse spectrum of events ranging from the mundane to the extreme, and we're pushed to experience many emotions including regret, grief, fear, hope, courage, joy, and every kind of love.  All of this is done with a measured sensitivity and nuance, without ever going overboard into crass sensationalism.

Perhaps the central lessons that I distilled from this movie are (a) that we should try to live each day fully rather than taking things for granted (especially our loved ones), and (b) that we should strive for courage and strength in facing the challenges and suffering that life inevitably presents.  These lessons may seem obvious, but we need reminders, and this movie reminds powerfully.

I was deeply touched by this movie, and I rank it among the best that I've ever seen.  I certainly recommend it to anyone looking for something which goes beyond mere entertainment and instead shows us what art, at its best, can offer.

Finally, let me just note that, if you loved Forrest Gump, you'll love this movie.  Likewise, if you didn't like Forrest Gump, you won't like this movie either.

A baby is born old, exhibiting all the indicia of very old age, but unlike those born with progeria, the baby, as it grows and develops, gets younger. While not a bad film, it is not a particularly good one either, despite all its bells and whistles. Sure it has lots of intriguing special effects, but the story somehow meanders about and falls flat.  Though comparisons have been made to ""Forrest Gump"", this film pales in contrast, because ""Forrest Gump"" was a great film, and this one is not.

When Benjamin is born, his mother dies after giving birth to him. The grieving father, horrified by the wizened appearance of his new born son, takes him and abandons him on the steps of an old age home, where he is taken in by a woman who runs the home. In the wise, loving arms of his adopted mother, Benjamin grows into manhood. Surrounded by old people who accept him, after all, he physically mirrors them, life is good to Benjamin. There he also meets Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the residents, and is smitten. Even though they are close in age, she looks like the child she is, while he looks as if he could be her grandmother's husband. She will, however, always be the love of his life.

While they part and grow into adulthood, at one point they look almost the same age and before you know it, Benjamin and Daisy are joined at the hip. True love has blossomed and finally been made possible while they are in their forties, and it is great while it lasts. Alas, the inevitability of Benjamin's future looms forbiddingly, and there is simply no happy ending, only a very poignant one.

While there are many great performances in this film, and Cate Blanchett is positively luminous, Brad Pitt's performance is somewhat moribund. While a bit disappointing, his performance is not what does this film in. The film is done in by its own emotional torpor.

The premise of a man growing younger made no sense to me before seeing the movie, and made little sense after. Of course, I liked Brad Pit and Cate Blanchett as well as the other performers, but the story just depressed and confused me.

Benjamin is born and is pronounced by the doctor to have little time to live as he has an assortment of diseases which resemble those of advanced age.  He then grows up having all sorts of interesting adventures and romances but after a full life when it is time for him to die he starts to get smaller (note, up until now he has been growing larger but younger... and now he is growing smaller and younger) becoming first a forgetful child, then a small child who forgets how to speak, how to walk and then an infant.  In the final scene when being held in the arms of his one time lover (who has become his caretaker and effectively his mother), he looks into his lovers face as a beautiful infant perhaps remembering who she (and he) were, and goes to sleep, and ultimately dies.  This sequence made no sense and I found it to be really upsetting.  I usually have trouble with the tenses when I write but this story really gave me trouble.

If this film suggested some new idea, besides death being only for old people in aged and broken down bodies, I might have felt the news was worth the depressing message.  I didn't need this film to tell me that in an ideal world children in brand new bodies should never die. I feel if a film must depress it should make you feel that you have learned something new or profoundly true about the human condition.

Halfway through this film it became evident that the main point the filmmakers were trying to make was that they could pull off the technical feat of reverse-aging Brad Pitt. Frankly, I thought the CGI looked rather fake. Whenever the little-old-young Pitt talked, he looked like a claymation creature. Maybe that's why he spends most of the film looking mildly bewildered, doing and saying pretty much nothing. But let's allow for a moment that the filmmakers succeeded in this reverse-aging feat. What else does this movie have going for it?
Honestly I can't think of anything. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are phony and Pitt's character isn't really even particularly likeable. It's like _Forrest Gump_ if Forrest weren't particularly endearing and he never really did anything interesting. It's like _Beaches_ (ugh) except the characterization is too weak for words. Women fall for the old-young Pitt for no apparent reason at all. He really has no personality to speak of, except, gee whiz, he's aging in reverse. His lines are insipid and pointless. The movie utterly fails to justify why Cate Blanchett is infatuated with him, and their delayed love story creates the only real arc the story has. Then the arc takes a random turn&nbsp;&nbsp;when he abandons his love and their baby daughter, so the baby doesn't have to see him in his reverse aging process. Cate can't understand it and neither can we. Later we learn he writes letters to his daughter saying he ""wishes he could have"" been there for her first steps, her first day at kindergarten, etc., and we viewers are supposed to somehow feel empathy about this. Instead we feel contempt. What an idiot. He goes and looks at pyramids and crap, knowing his days are numbered, when all the while he could be raising his daughter -- which he claims is what he really ""wishes"" he could do. Ridiculous!
OK, I'm ranting. But I gotta tell you, I put off seeing this movie because I knew it had been over-hyped at the Oscars and I didn't want my expectations to be too high. But really it was just a waste of two hours. Benjamin Button is a great big bore!!!",1249257600,35,2210,4.7578125

I understand that the main character was aging backwards, but does that have to mean that he is born ""mature"" and stays that way?  Have these writers never heard about character development.  If the main character doesn't grow, change, then a lot of exciting things better be happening all around him.  The choices that the writers made were poor.  In one of the user reviews someone points out the lack of conflict, which is one of the big problems.  I'll put it a bit more simply.  If this guy were aging forward, would there be any reason to make a movie about him?  No!  Even Fitzgerald's original story is more interesting.  It has Benjamin behave his age as he grows younger.  He is curmudgeonly as an old man, full of himself in middle age and flirty and stupid in youth.  He lives his life instead of staying basically the same aloof blank throughout.  My problem with this guy is that he doesn't react to the things happening in his life - i.e. he doesn't behave like a human being.  Everything gets tied up in neat little packages.  He leaves his wife, but she finds a ""good man"" to help her raise their child.  His lover swims the English channel as an old woman.  He ""forgives"" his father.  When he is dying his wife is almost magically there to take care of him.  It's too neat.

3754082,4,B001PO5N6G,"Director David Fincher always has kept his worldview dark and depressing, and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is no exception. He again directs Brad Pitt (previously in Fincher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven/dp/B000050FEN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven</a>), this time as a man inexplicably born with all the physical characteristics of an 80 year old who then ages in reverse. All this while his mental faculties work in standard time, so he gains an old man's lifetime of memories. While Fincher usually pulls at the strings that manipulate us into staring at the darkness of man (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zodiac/dp/B000QUCNP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zodiac</a>), this time he goes right for melodramatic heartstrings.

It's not always a perfect fit. While Fincher has, as usual, made a gorgeously rich looking movie, there are times when you wonder why Benjamin was just free to wander aimlessly through life, not having scientists and doctors swarming around him. And while the story of the clock at the beginning of the movie is a poignant allegory and therefore seemed useful to the film, the element of Hurricane Katrina as a timing device seemed crowbarred in. Will that stop you from needing at least one box of Kleenex to make it through this movie? Not at all.

""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a moving story of how aging takes us through life, both in love and in tragedy. ""We all end up in diapers,"" says Daisy (Cate Blanchett, amazing as always) who tries to make sense of her love with a man that can only drift away. The cast is uniformly strong throughout, with Taraji P. Henson as Queenie getting the best 'wisdom' lines, a scene stealing Tilda Swinton as Benjamin's first love affair and Jared Harris as Capt Mike, the swashbuckling tugboat man with the heart of an artist. The overall tragedy is speckled with bits of humor and lots of deep love.

In the end, though, the movie belongs to Brad Pitt. Through make-up, CGI and other devices, he portrays Benjamin as man out of time, trying to comprehend the way life has changed the world as he moves in reverse of everyone around him. Even though he is absent from the last 30 minutes, his presence is felt in the way Daisy takes him back to where everything began. Sad and beautiful all at the same time, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a grand movie that falls short of greatness; nonetheless it is worth your time.",1247875200,3,2523,5.20935960591133

3754085,1,B001PO5N6G,"Why is this film dull? Could it be that the characters are empty, and that they passively coast through the story, meekly awaiting their fate? The fact that Ben Button is growing younger might be expected to twist his psychology in an interesting way: unfortunately we are given no insight into this psychology. He takes the first manual job that comes along, a business is bequeathed to him, and his imagination is limited to pursuing his childhood sweetheart - all this challenges him to the most minimal degree, and he is asked to make virtually no interesting decisions. Yes, he is growing younger, but this seems to make almost no impact upon him, nor upon those around him. The character appears to be a very unreflective and retiring person; what's more, Brad Pitt delivers a performance that is curious in being bereft of emotion - was he afraid of ruining his elaborate make-up? Kate Blanchett's character has a bit more spunk, but her restlessness is extinguished mid-film, and she too is reduced to a pretty well silent witness to proceedings from then on. There is virtually no internal, nor much external, conflict between the protagonists, nor between them and the world.

All this amounts to an idea in search of a story. Imagine if you were asked to watch a monkey being born old, then slowly growing younger as time went on, until finally petering out. As a three minute video on Youtube this would be (kind of) interesting. If it went on for three hours, I don't think many viewers would last the distance. Without a story, the novelty wears thin - as is the case here.",1247443200,46,1587,4.7086330935251794
3754086,3,B001PO5N6G,"With comparisons to to the far superior ""Forrest Gump"" aplenty, David Fincher's VERY loosely based adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story manages to stand, though wobbly, on its own. From a technical aspect, ""Benjamin"" is flawless, a masterpiece of technical wizardry and attention to detail. Yet, from the standpoint of a story, it's sadly lacking any kind of emotion, which is surprising and ironic because the actors certainly convey enough emotion. It's just that these emotions never fully involve the viewer like it did in ""Forrest Gump."" We're not really sure if we even knew who Benjamin Button really was, even though we spend nearly 3 hours with him. This also goes for the character of Daisy. As a result, we're not fully convinced or even that involved with the story, which is a shame because it's a very interesting set-up: a man is born old and continues to age backwards. It's a brilliant and commendable premise that I applaud director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth (who also penned ""Gump"") for attempting to tackle such an odd non-Hollywood story involving themes of mortality. Unfortunately, the end result isn't as beautiful as the picture itself presents to be.

Though this is a failed masterpiece, it is definitely worth seeing. When something this strange comes out of Hollywood and everyone's paying attention (mainly because of the lead actors), it time to rejoice that film is still able to be creative.",1247443200,,1450,5.041666666666667
3754087,2,B001PO5N6G,"I had heard so much hype about The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I had to see it even though I rarely watch Brad Pitt movies, not being a particular fan of his work. Usually, when I have low expectations of a movie, which I had about this one (it sounded preposterous to me, but I simply wanted to quell my curiosity), I end up liking it far more than if I had high or higher expectations. However, this movie broke that mold for me.

There are a hundred thousand stories yet to be told to entertain us into oblivion. This is one that should have been left untold or given to a different group of people to bring it to life. I would have given it one star, but I gave it two because there were some extraordinary performances outside of the main character that do not deserve to be ignored.

I think the director of this movie made some odd choices in putting the final version together. Button is born old and ages backward. If you can buy that ""genetic anomaly,"" I suppose you wouldn't look too closely at how much opportunity was wasted after his birth. There is no explanation for his sudden piano-playing ability, no education to speak of, no indication that Button was aware of his odd situation until, suddenly, Brad Pitt appears in the role and just as suddenly, he is gorgeous, well-muscled, and a heart throb. I guess the whole thing transcended my ability to process the ""outside-the-box"" growth issue inherent in this story. I just thought it was clumsy and unendearing.

There is no doubt in my mind that a much better story lay somewhere in that picture. A different director, producer, actor, perhaps. Tweaking the story to make more sense with better communication between Button and those around him as the story unfolds perhaps. As it was, it appeared to me, to be a messy story and another two hours of my life wasted when I could have been watching something far more worthwhile. I am not unaware of the popularity of this movie amongst much more esteemed reviewers here at Amazon.com than I am. But watching it from a director's eye, I could almost write a book about how many things were wrong with this movie. If a movie has character, I can always forgive those wrong things. The only curious thing about this movie, is that it made it to the movie theaters and so many people raved about it.

There is a good cast of characters and Pitt delivers his normal better than average performance, but what kills this movie is the female lead actress.

And there are also movies that I have slightly mixed feelings about when the credits start to roll, and that's what Benjamin Button is for me. It's been 3 days since I've seen it, and like Children of Men or History of Violence before it, it's only grew fonder with time.

As I was sitting in the theater, I was mesmorized by what I've been watching...and quite sure this would be my absolute favorite movie of the year. Then around the midway point the film kind of lost me for a little. I didn't like the choices some characters were making...but looking back on it now, I think it probably serves the overall movie better. But while watching the movie the first time, I was a little annoyed. That's why I think the movie will play a lot better on future viewings.

Yet, I've only seen it once, so that's how I have to review it. It really is a beautiful movie, and the themes are some I can really connect with; ""Nothing Lasts"" and ""how one little insignificant choice can alter things in ways you'd never imagine"" and ""regret"". The movie really is the Anti-Forest Gump if you think about it. Both movie's are about one man's incredible life.....but while Gump might leave you feeling great, Button might leave you feeling like your dog just died (without resorting to manipulative crap like Marley and Me!). The movie didn't really have that one ""CRY HERE"" moment...but I was honestly fighting back manly tears for a good long while on this one (nothing fell mind you!).
Cate and Brad are fantastic in this one, and the FX are pretty much as flawless as they come (definitely the best of the year).

I've intentionally left this review as vague as possible, because I don't want to spoil it for you. I'm not sure if this movie is for everyone. The crowd sounded pretty mixed as I was walking out of the theater, and i know my wife did not like it. It's almost 3 hours long, and while I didn't feel it, my wife was ready for it to be over after the first hour...also, she doesn't like Cate for whatever odd reason (I LOVE Cate and thought she was amazing in it).

So anyway, for me, it's one of the best movies of the year. It's not my current favorite, but I think this is the kind that will get better each time I see it. With that said, I give the movie a solid A-/A. Highly recommended, but probably not for everyone.",1247097600,2,2452,4.370614035087719

And besides, we want to believe in that which touches the heart, scares us half to death or brings sidesplitting laughter. This is why we love to watch movies. It is why the best of them appear to be timeless.

This film is excellent on every level. The story was handled perfectly. It is a rich and expansive tale. One might think that time is the subject here, but in truth, it is nothing more than another great love story. `Nothing more' because it doesn't get lost in it's circumstances. The direction of David Fincher wrings every bit of energy and emotion from the cast that allows this story to thrive.

Brad Pitt crafts an unforgettable performance as 'Benjamin Button'. It is perhaps, his finest work to date. He creates an even-tempered, and sophisticated man.
A man who thirsts for a knowledge and understanding of a world that seems upside down, but that also has dropped great compassion on his doorstep.

Taraji Henson is outstanding as the mother that recognizes beauty, the future and the hand of god in her son's disposition. Mahershalalhashbaz Ali compliments Hensen's 'Queenie' as 'Tizzy', the other man in her life. Jared Harris is 'Captain Mike' who in the proverbial split-second decision becomes Benjamin's mentor in the ways of the world.

Menageries of characters pass through `Benjamin's' world. It is they who are rambunctious and animated. They show Benjamin the aspects of life that can easily be missed, and thus bypass the great experiences that life offer. It is Benjamin who realizes that one must be brave enough to grasp these opportunities.

'Benjamin Button' was a movie I had read about, seen the trailers for and was convinced I shouldn't see. I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know already. It wasn't long into the film that I knew I was wrong. With the end credits came the realization that I had just experienced an incredible story.",1245715200,2,2019,4.773638968481375

Slowly, Benjamin takes on the frame of a man well into his '80s.

When Benjamin first meets Daisy (Cate Blanchett), she's perhaps 10 years old to Benjamin's 70, but it's a meeting of children nonetheless. It's also the start of a love story that develops slowly, and eloquently, over the course of decades. The film itself spans the entire course of Benjamin's life, following his ""childhood"" spent in the home to his ""adolescence"" spent at sea with Captain Mike, following the currents directly into the events of World War II and home once again, back into the company of Daisy. It's not a complicated film, just a broad one and its magic is simply in the depth of Benjamin's point of view.

This is in large part attributable to the absolute triumph of director David Fincher, whose visual mastery and unsentimental approach never spoon-feeds the audience or over-sweetens the narrative.

3754129,4,B001PO5N6G,"For all his good looks and great physique, Brad Pitt has an uncanny ability to pick great movies that explore the human experience and human psyche.  With movies such as Se7en, Jesse James, Babel, Seven Years in Tibet, and now this hit from late 2008, Mr. Pitt has established himself as one of the top actors over the past 2 decades with great performances in multiple genres.  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is probably Pitt's best work, as he carried the film.  Unlike previous movies, he shares screentime with multiple co-stars in this film such as Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett, but carries the movie by himself as his scenes with either of these great actresses alone deserve a Best Actor nod.

This movie is based on a short story of the same name by American literary giant F. S. Fitzgerald.  It tells the story of a Benjamin Button who is born old, and ages young such that his dying breath is that of an infant.  Along the way, he experiences rejection, adultery, war, marriage, fatherhood, longing, family loss and family gained; in short a full and complete life.  The audience sees Mr. Button travel the world as both a poor man and a rich man, from India to Russia to New York to Southeast Asia; all to experience the variety of humanity and the richness of companionship.  Coming in at under 3 hours, this drama is quite riveting.  For a movie with very little action, every minute of the movie held my attention through dialogue that ranged from witty to ironic to insightful; all of which showing that a man need not a college education to express great thoughts.

So all in all, a great movie; surely one of the best of 2008.  My only issue was with the DVD itself; it contained no extra features and did not have an option to choose different scenes.  This is a minus for such a long movie; the ability stop a movie and come back the next day to the scene you left of at is quite important.  Hence the 4 out of 5 stars.",1245456000,3,1947,4.450704225352113

3754131,4,B001PO5N6G,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button combines an intriguing story, excellent acting, and first-rate special effects, but, ultimately, it suffers from the weakness of its framing device -- a woman reading her dying mother's journal in New Orleans, just before Hurricane Katrina makes landfall.

The plot is relatively well-known by now:  Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is born a wrinkled, arthritic old man who, over time, grows younger as everyone he knows gets older.  Abandoned by his father, Benjamin is raised by  Queenie (Taraji Henson, in a memorable performance), a black servant who takes pity on him, then truly becomes his mother. Benjamin falls in love with Daisy (first Elle Fanning, then Cate Blanchett) and lives an extraordinary varied life, largely through happenstance, much like Forrest Gump.  The frame of the story, with Julia Ormond as Caroline at her dying mother Daisy's bedside, rarely gets mentioned since its effectiveness lags except to drive home the themes of the story:  it's never too late to make something of yourself, that you must grasp the opportunities you have while you can; that life and time are fleeting.  The problem is that the fairy-tale like story of Benjamin Button seems grossly out of place in the midst of a recent current event.  The backdrop of New Orleans and the approaching hurricane seems a forced attempt to get the viewer to embrace this story as true, when instead it detracts from it.

Despite its flaws, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is well worth seeing, if for no other reason than for its unconventional story line and the acting that supports it.  In a time when so many films seem like a rehash of what has been done before, this one offers a refreshing change.",1245283200,,1729,4.931034482758621
3754132,1,B001PO5N6G,"This movie was very disappointing, and too slow - even with the great cast I turned it off halfway -",1245196800,3,100,4.05
3754133,2,B001PO5N6G,"I'm dissapointed to see David Fincher wasting his time on this melodramatic rubbish. He used to be a director with a message now he's all style and no substance. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is oscar baiting at it's worst with a concept that runs out of steam in the first thirty minutes and is told quite possibly the worst way; via the Cate Blanchet characters point of view when Benjamin is narrating his own story when we flash back so whats the point of having her in the hospital having her daughter read her a diary? As always with these characters Benajmin is a passive loser surrounded by quirky characters who all pass along a little bit of knowledge about life. This knowledge never rings true and is as shallow as Benjamin himself. He's never angry that he ages backwards. Hell he's barely interested in his own disease you'd never know that he even KNEW he was aging backwards except everyone keeps telling him about it.

The film's lesson is that aging backwards has about as much meaning as aging forward; no meaning at all. Button is a boring and tired protagonist. He's given no obstacles to over come and a girlfriend who treats him like garbage most of the time but he keeps coming back for more just like Forrest Gump and Jenny. For its three hour running time Button has little to say on life but it has alot to say about trying desperately to win an oscar. Shame on you David Fincher for wasting your talents on this dribble.",1245196800,4,1454,4.507575757575758
3754134,2,B001PO5N6G,"Whether people remember it as such or not, it feels like Button is the movie that demonstrated when the dust settled on his real life relationship with Angelina Jolie whether the public would enjoy watching him in the movies still.  The answer was a quiet and resounding yes, but this movie still seems to cast a sad note on his career that has an odd feeling of connection to the beginning of his career in ""Johnny Suede.""

Literature lovers will note the differences in text and the implications of these on this three hour film.  Several added subplots, severe tonal differences from the book and terrible stylistic choices are problems that will sink the hopes of a number of film fans and hoards of casual watchers, but the film's pace is what ultimately makes it unimportant.  For a long, slow, uninvolving, depressed film about a ""simple man"" it suprises me to be able to say it's also schizophrenic at times, and doesn't really understand the story it's trying to tell.

We think the reason Ben was born this way was because of the blind clockmaker, but that's never truly explained, and confusion with his identity in relation to his age (as opposed to how he looks) seems to be the majority of issue in the film.  It's clear this wasn't what the screenwriter and director wished to express since they don't really make a number of things clear even for those who pay attention. Benjamin Button as a character is impenetrable. You may be able to understand his thinking at times merely because of what's happened in his life and his unique circumstance, but his insight and personal opinion are largely absent which is curious since the story is being told from his own words via his diary and there lies the emotional and character problem with the movie.  The movie isn't really about him and yet he's right there in the center, you'd think he would have more to say.
  His silence on his own feelings is something the audience has to come up with themselves. At first, you think it's because he's a soul trapped and confused but after awhile you suspect and probably settle on the idea that he's mildly retarded because he rarely talks in a way that is more than servicable and writes in a way that tells you everything you don't want to know.  People talk about Forrest Gump comparisons because of the writer and similarities in character, story, and obsession with state of the art effects mimicking old film stock.  Interestingly, Gump says more of his own feelings and perspective even though he seems to be the more mentally hindered of the two.  He also seems to make the most of his oppotunities whereas things just seem to happen to Ben.  I understand the difference in physical infirmities given to Ben, but they can't really justify his lack of action.  In some ways the two characters are the antithesis of one another, one extroverted and natural and the other inward and we really wonder who he is even after the 3 hours.  With such an inward character we grasp out for something to take his place and nothing does.
  We see the affects of his story being read by his daughter to his love on her death bed in what is one of the worst collections of storytelling  ideas in history.  The daughter is underderstandably haggard, why would seeing her invoke anything except a suggestion to take a nap and relax let alone keep flashing back to her telling the story.  While this is happening Hurricane Katrina is about to go off outside and it just reeks of opportunistic fervor in this story.  To top this all off, the elderly woman is Southern and out of breath in an ""I'm going to die.....but not just yet, I've got some plot points off ma chest.""  Now, I don't want to replicate what she sounds like, but to anyone who's had to experience this kind of speech pattern in real life, southerners included, will no doubt agree that it's the kind of speech that no one wants to listen to since it's pain all around.  Pain for the listener, for the speaker, and for the actor in this instance is in abundance.  Fortunately, it doesn't last very long, but the fact she speaks at all for the rest of the film is terrible.  It comes off as a sick joke at the beginning and only becomes less so because she says less and less until she dies.  Not sure why these two are the two that read the diaries as they're not particularly interesting, or passionate, and come off just as resonant as Ben.
  I made it through the movie well despite it's running time with the help of a Monster energy drink and was very patient and sedate in processing the overlong and basically meaningless film.  Length and pace don't mean a film's boring by themselves, I myself sat through the six hour Italian film ""Best of Youth"" in succession (the theatre showed them in separate 3 hour increments with separate admission) and was riveted without the aid of any caffiene, vitamin based energy drink, or otherwise.  While the film isn't boring, it also isn't riveting, or thought-provoking due to good storytelling.  Anytime the film causes you to think it's because of details the filmmakers either failed to include, or didn't think were important.

  Examples of this lack of foresight, or ignorance are numerous.  It starts at the beginning with the story of the clock (what's the significance? how does it tie in with the rest of the world?) right down to how mature is Benjamin internally when the world, his mother included, treat him in ways that are probably inappropriate considering his true age.  This is something we're never clued into, but I felt the movie not addressing this was sloppy and not thoughtful.  The fact I'm stating this objection now and not saying ""well, who really knows?"" is a sign that the movie doesn't really take its central idea seriously they just like what it conjures and that's not good enough.  If you're going to change an original work to fit your meaning it should fit like a glove and their film has a number of ugly tears, misplaced stitches, stains, and frays.  A thoughtful person who doesn't care for storytelling would excuse these problems and say they don't matter, but a person who loves storytelling in all its shapes and sizes will recognize this as substandard work that gets away with it because of the pace, soundtrack, and reserved performances of its leads placing the audience into a dulled silence. There's a reason why it's called the case of Benjamin Button instead of ""the story"" aside from the literature title, it feels like it's treated as a case and not a story. Fincher is able to make violence tranquill and elegant and boring situations interesting as he does here, but he clearly doesn't have the mind of a writer, or the gift of dramatic detail.
  As for the two stars, I'll let you in on that: it has to do with the tangental elements the film doesn't really use.  The story of the clockmaker although told through the voice of old dying woman is still more interesting than a majority of the story and his heartfelt apology to the people after he explains why it ticks backward is truly moving.  The man who was struck by lightning seven times conversely is kind of silly but it lightens up a murky mood and distracts from the lack of momentum the movie feels throughout.  Finally, the character who merges both of these strengths is tugboat captain played by Jared Harris.  He's always good and sometimes feels out of place because of his strong acting choices and accent, but he's always bringing vigor and vitality to his roles.  Here, he makes you completely forget everything that happened before he stepped into frame and he makes you sad that he's leaving after being wounded in the submarine incident.  He's an artist indeed and the only one who emerges victorius in his battle with the drab and lukewarm plot.
  I don't recommend this film to anyone because it has nothing going for it. The good spots are enough to outweigh the bland and empty and it wastes a lot of talent.  Even Brad Pitt fans won't get what they want.  There are love scenes and sex is a major issue that comes up in the course of his life, however, it's treated in a very limited manner and even the emotional payoffs are shortchanged.  In short, nothing is savored and there's no sex to make it titilatting.  I would hesitate, in fairness, before admitting it's not even sensual which actually accurately describes the whole movie.  It's not a sense of taste, or attention span, that seals the deal, but a lack of story and plot instead of heart.  A Curious Case indeed.",1245110400,4,8521,4.6221779548472774

The making of is very well made and after see it, I couldn't help but think what that the scrapped Spielberg or Spike Jonze versions might be superior.

Fincher tone seems strangely distant, unable/unwilling to peer into the soul of Benjamin, as a mainstream film, it is accessible and entertaining, but for a Fincherfilm(tm), I felt let down after the epic that was Zodiac.",1245024000,,790,4.801470588235294

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is such a film. There are many more films than this with a far more believable premise that do not stand up to scrutiny the way this masterpiece does.  The ;ast film (and only
film until this one) that actually made me produce tears was Philip Noyce's brilliant remake of The Quiet American, a masterpiece along with
this gem. There are many excellent films that I soon forget after watching, but Brad Pitt's performance carried a chivalry, presence and nuance that was simply amazing to behold. This film is beatiful in its
sadness and ennui and will in ten-year's time stand up to scrutiny

I knew that Fitzgerald wrote it as a short story and that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were the playing the leads( loved ""Interview with a Vampire""  and "" Elizabeth "" )and it was set in New Orleans. It was the reviews that got to me...most so different, so I had to see for myself. After almost 3 hours of watchng it I fell in love with the characters and all the changes throughout the many decades that Benjamin & Daisy went through, together and apart. From the end of WWI 1918 to 2006 an entire life span. It was an epic film... as in forrest Gump epic where you were living the history with them and saw the times changing. No matter what age Benjamin was at the time, they loved each other, But he had the wisdom to know he had to wait for Daisy to grow up emotionally, before she was ready to fall in love with him.( they had to meet in the middle ) I could feel the emotion  just by watching the film ( which is harder to portray in films and easier to do in books ...it's usually the other way around )No matter where they were in the world, they always found each other. The ending was predictable you knew it was coming, but still needed to watch it to the end. I probably would have given it 5 stars, but it was sooooooooo long, happy I watched at home so I could get comfortable and could pause the movie  when needed.

3754139,3,B001PO5N6G,"This is, while a technically brilliant piece of filmmaking that fully exploits all the wizardry of CGI and makeup of which the filmmaker's art is now capable, strangely hollow at the center.  One begins the movie expecting some profound truths about human existence to be explored, but it ends not with a big life-affirming bang, but more of a whimper, quite literally.  Benjamin says though his diary at one point: ""Life is defined by opportunities--even the ones we miss.""  And that could be a sum-up of this film project as a whole, as well as the life of the bizarre hero at its center.  One gets the sense of promise grasped for here but not quite realized as the technical and stylistic gymnastics of this movie overwhelm the fragile love story that should be its beating heart.

The film opens with Mr. Gateau (Cake) constructing a magical clock that runs backwards and mounting it in a train station in New Orleans in honor of his son, dead in the Great War.  No mention is made again of Mr. Gateau or whether his clock was successful in rewinding time to bring dead boys back to life.  It does have a curious effect on the life of one boy, though, as Benjamin enters the world essentially running backwards.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's quizzical that the clock has this metaphysical effect on only Benjamin among all the other children born afterwards, but then, fantasy is not required to operate by the rules of logic. Perhaps Benjamin, with a Gullah mother was particularly susceptible to magic, and how serendipitous that old-man baby Benjamin's grieving father abandoned him, along with $18 on the steps of an old-folks home, rather than say, a brothel . . .this being New Orleans, after all.  What are the chances, outside the realm of fantastical fiction, furthermore that Benjamin's progenitor be named Mr. Button, and that he own a button factory?  Otherwise we wouldn't have such nifty alliteration.

Countless comparisons have been made to ""Forrest Gump"", with which this narrative does share structural similarities.  However, that didn't occur to me while I was watching and found instead resonance with one of Pitt's earlier characters, Tristan Ludlow from ""Legends of the Fall""--like Benjamin, Tristan is a soul set apart, blessed or cursed with mystical powers he does not fully understand; uncomfortable among other people and destined to lose the true love of his life due to his own inability to live a normal life.  Scenes of Benjamin travelling to foreign shores and sailing a boat underscored this impression.  (The presence of Julia Ormond, here playing the adult daughter of the aged Daisy was just a bonus, since she and Pitt have no scenes together.)  The setting of New Orleans during Benjamin's childhood in the early decades of the last century also reminded me of Louis Malle's ""Pretty Baby"".

This film is technically dazzling, but I think it was justly deprived of the top acting awards.  With so much else to be distracted by, the acting had a job of it to even be noticed, really.  Cate Blanchett is luminous, as usual.  I had my doubts a 38-year-old mother of three could pull off a 23-year-old ballerina, but La Blanchett can do anything.  The greatest curiosity I had, to be honest, was in how they were going to make Brad Pitt look 18 again.  Brad has taken pretty good care of his body over the years, but the strain of being father to the United Tribe of Benetton is starting to show . . .at least when he's not on a movie set.  When he's lit and coiffed for a film, he does not look anything like a 46-year-old father of six.  He can easily pass for a decade younger . . .but I thought 18 would be pushing it.  Well . . . did I say that the makeup department is amazing??  Looking at the scene of an 18-year-old Benjamin coming to visit the now-58-year-old Daisy--wow.  It was like having a flashback to Mr. Pitt's debut in ""Thelma & Louise"", and it was a very unsettling feeling.  ""Unsettling"" is the best descriptor for this movie.  Parts of it were stunning to look at, but its tragic meditations on the ultimate inablity of love to bring any meaning to human life leaves you wrung out and uncertain whether you are better off having seen it than you were before.",1245024000,35,4231,4.681081081081081

For one thing, half of the stupid movie is done in flasback black and white.  Plus, it is so easy for people to get lost in this movie.  Of the two people watching it with me, I was the only one who could keep up with the storyline.  This movie had elements that really just ticked me off.  First of all if you are pentecostal, it makes us look like nuts who shove people over and thank God for a miracle that really did not happen.  It uses curse words for emphasis in places where emphasis is not needed.  Then within the last thirty minutes of the movie, it feels that it can redeem itself by throwing in partial sex scene after partial sex scene.  It also throws in some lesbian comments that were just so out of place.  I honesly believe that they should use this movie for torture at Guantonomo Bay.  If you can watch this movie and not crack, then you are extremely tough.  What a waste of time.  And like another review said, it tries to mix so many movies.

3754142,5,B001PO5N6G,"This is not normally my type of movie. Moreover, Brad Pitt is not always my favorite actor. Yet he knows how to pick movies with a character that is made just for him. This movie definitely is.

The basic premise is simple. It is of a person, Benjamin button, whom was born old and becomes younger with time. We get to follow his life through a series of flashbacks in which the reader eventually realizes she is his daughter. The story line is simple but what makes the movie is the presentation from the color the sound to the great acting. This is one of those movies that doesn't take you very long to forget that you're watching a movie and it makes you feel like you're part.

Be sure to watch the movie again with the voiceover by David Fincher and you will see what he is trying to portray and how well he does it. The cinema presentation is loosely based on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

I have only seen the Blu-Ray Criterion version of this film so I cannot comment on the others.

3754144,4,B001PO5N6G,"Though The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is long (we watched half of it one night, the other half on another night), I think it's rich with fantasy, amazing production qualities (the film is gorgeous to look at, from start to finish), and some really good performances.

The plot: Benjamin Button (played by Brad Pitt) is born at the end of World War I to a wealthy New Orleans family. His mother dies in childbirth. When Benjamin's father sees his new son, he is horrified. The baby appears unnaturally aged/sick, with wrinkled skin. The shocked, unprepared new father leaves the infant on a doorstep.

Luckily, that doorstep belongs to an old folks' home managed by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson, in an inspired performance). Heartsick Queenie is unable to have children of her own, and she takes the unfortunate little one in. As a child, Benjamin has the appearance and physical ability of a 70-year-old man and the mental capabilities of a child. The older Benjamin gets, however, the more apparent it becomes - he's aging backwards.

It's at the home that Benjamin meets Daisy (Cate Blanchett). The two feel an instant connection.

As Benjamin hits his teenaged years, he takes a job on a tugboat, travels the world, and begins to live his life. The rest of the movie follows he and Daisy (who grows up to be a prima ballerina) as the two find love, find one another, and experience the inevitable loss that is characteristic of the human experience.

Cast-wise, I think the star is clearly Blanchett, followed at a close second by Henson. Though Pitt does an admirable job, his Benjamin is a man of few words, which doesn't do much for the acting fireworks.

Effects/makeup were wonderful, though I did feel that dim lighting in many scenes affected my full appreciation of the technology used to both age characters and ""turn back the clock."" (It was almost as if they were trying to hide Pitt in some scenes, maybe for a bigger reveal later? At any rate, I didn't like it. Just tell the story.)

There was alot of symbolism in this movie, a lot of imagery related to time/mortality throughout the film, and many themes dealing with ""other"" types. If you're thinking that the film will bear any resemblance to the F. Scott Fitzgerald story it's based on, think again. The movie uses the basic premise of the story, nothing more.",1244851200,,2334,4.733990147783251
3754164,2,B001PO5N6G,"I was -like many other people- willing to like this movie, but it manages to disappoint consistently for all but its last 15 minutes.

The cosmic reasons for Benjamin's backward aging are never explained (the clock at the train station is NOT an explanation - since one would rationally assume that several babies would have been born that same night in the city with the same condition as he). It is nothing more than a gimmick since neither existential issues nor insights are drawn from his surprisingly uninteresting life. The writing doesn't help much since when it tries to be deep or insightful that's precisely the impression it gives; that it is trying.

The main acting talent in this movie is absolutly top-notch. Pitt delivers consistently and this movie was no exception. Taraji Henson is truthful (if a little restrained) and Cate Blanchett is without a doubt one of the best film actors of her generation. Yet, it is the vague movie direction by David Fincher (who was great in Zodiac) which wastes the talent in what could have been an epic movie.

Characters move through the movie without clear motivations or objectives and often seem not to be affected by what happens to them. Button's obstinacy in loving Daisy should be the backbone of the movie, but when faced by the prospect of being a father while growing younger he leaves without considering alternatives, and Daisy doesn't even put up much of a fight! Parents would do anything to avoid their child's suffering, but why did Benjamin never consider that due to his own extraordinary circumstances, his child would just have to live an unusual life? Wouldn't his child be better served by having a mature parent for at least 11 years of her life than not having him at all? How many parents who die prematurely would not give anything to spend a little more time with their kids? These are not easy questions to answer but the movie doesn't bother to ask them, either.

The movie spends a good amount of celluloid telling a story in the longest, most roundabout way possible. At first, still giving it a chance I focused more on the atmosphere being created, but there wasn't much there either. Benjamin joins a ship, has an affair and faces one battle in WWII and doesn't seemed changed by any of it, because he apparently thinks his life is less interesting than even we do. When he comes back home, the level of his joy at seeing Queenie (his ""mom"") would tell one he's been gone only a week and not a few years... at war! I blame this not on Pitt's or Henson's acting but on Fincher's direction. While one could make the concession that living in a home where people constantly died made Benjamin less willing to become attached to anyone, that would also mean that it makes the character less interesting, since apathy is not a quality one wishes to see in a main character.

To boot, while the story of his life is being pieced together by diary entries (thus obviously from a first person perspective) when narrating how Daisy's accident came to end her dancing career; Benjamin momentarily develops an omniscient narrative; he knows every single detail of what led to it (one is left wondering why he didn't use that omniscience in preventing an eventual pregnancy that he apparently never wanted to happen). The narrative itself is interesting but it violates the premise the movie had already established.

The bad choices made in this film are many but the final fifteen minutes almost make one say it makes up for them. The final scene of Benjamin's life, when Daisy narrates his final moments and the absolutly loving, heartbreaking way in which she covers the face of the dead baby Benjamin in her arms, is the most beautiful scene I have seen in any movie. She was being a mother to the man who once was her husband and Blancett nailed every single gesture and emotion when taking care of young Benjamin. Blanchett is amazing.

The movie goes on to tie Daisy's own passing to the Katrina disaster, which also destroys the clock (which never stopped running and is now relegated to a basement). A montage follows in which the people who touched Benjamin's life are seen doing what they did, but it doesn't seem to mean much and the viewer is thrown back into vagueness. One is left wondering, after almost three hours of watching, what was it exactly that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wanted to say.",1244851200,11,4398,4.703896103896104
3754165,3,B001PO5N6G,"Visually, this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  Every period in the film, from the roaring '20s of Benjamin's earliest years, to the 1960s when he lived briefly with the girl of his dreams, are captured almost perfectly onscreen.  The cinematography is practically flawless.  The film is so wonderfully atmospheric it's almost worth watching for that alone.  The special effects are remarkable as well.  At different points in the film, both Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt are made to look roughly twenty years younger than their actual ages.  This is relatively new in film.  It's been possible since the medium began to age actors with makeup, but now it's also possible to de-age them through the magic of CGI.  So where it would once have only been possible to make this film using very young actors to play the leads, and use make up to age them into their 40s and 50s and beyond, they can now cast established stars in their 40s and still have them convincingly play characters just out of their teens.  The technical wizardry behind this is amazing, and it's yet another example of the magic of the movies.

So on technical merits alone I'd give the film 5 out of 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the story does not quite live up to that high standard.  It's not bad, to be sure; I did enjoy the movie, but I couldn't help wonder, at the end of it all, what the point was.  As the reviewer for the Sunday Times aptly put it: ""It's a gimmick that goes on for nearly three hours.""  Now I don't think every story has to have a moral, or a great message, or all kinds of weighty allusions and themes, and so forth.  But simple, escapist entertainment just works better as a comedy or an action piece.  A moody, character-driven drama, one can't help but feel, ought to have a little more to say.  This movie, enjoyable as it is, seems like nothing more than an exercise in ""what if"" thinking -- what if a man could age backward?  What would that be like?  Storywise, the film seems to have nothing to offer beyond that, and one really doesn't need a 2 1/2 hour film to spell out all the sorrowful ramifications of such a scenario.

Still, the film is good for an evening's entertainment, and is a feast for the eyes.  Cate Blanchett is nearly always worth watching, and Pitt gives a very good performance as well.",1244764800,26,2327,4.479809976247031

I was shocked to say the least when I realized that Brad Pitt was to play a role like this. But the same I could say about Tom Hanks when he did Forrest after a vast array of comedies he did before that.

There are some similarities between this movie and Forrest but they are completely different stories. It also so happens that the screenwriter was the same one - ERIC ROTH.

I was quite dissapointed at the Oscars as I thought this movie was going to clean out and only got 3 awards and the rest was given to Slumdog Millionaire and Sean Penn got the best actor. I guess they were being sympathetic to the gay community because Brad Pitt really did a hell of a job and did deserved the best actor at the oscars this year.

 But at least there are people like me that are here to tell you the how grand this movie really is and is worth every penny that you spend on it.

3754169,3,B001PO5N6G,"Before I say anything, I think David Fincher is, not ONE OF, but THE best modern day director around. Unlike most directors of today, he is meticulous and strives for perfection. His images are perfect. His pre-planning and attention to detail is rivaled by only a few, including Alfred Hitchcock. While some film makers are caught up in the money pool and rush to the cinema, Fincher takes his time, chooses his projects carefully and makes darn sure that everything he does is perfect and without flaw.

Everything above applies to THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTONS with one very important exception, at least in this reviewer's opinion. The movie is flawed in one very important way. The pacing is absolutely awful. It is a slow-moving, one-note movie that starts you off with a creative idea about a baby born with the skin of an elderly man. Then the baby becomes a short, frail, wheel-chair old man that begins to age, backward. Once that is established, the movie allows you to watch Benjamin Buttons (Brad Pitt) life unfold.

Twice I sat down to watch it, and twice I lost interest. Eventually I decided to fast forward through the beginning part that I had already seen twice, and attempt to finish it. I figured I owed it to my favorite director.

Everything about BENJAMIN BUTTONS, other than pacing is perfection, just as I stated before. Fincher is a master at his craft. Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Taraji Henson are exceptional. The movie as a whole is a concept movie that tried to be made into a trophy winner. What it needed was somebody to realize, that it's just a movie and it needed to be trimmed and rethunk.",1244592000,2,1636,4.673611111111111

In other words, nothing original.  However when I noticed that it was a Criterion release I had to give it a shot and add it to my library of their titles.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was some originality to it and despite being over 2 and a half hours long I was in to the story the whole time.

I cannot believe how Brad Pitt always continues to evolve as an actor, even though I don't think he's the strongest actor out there ( and admittingly his perfect good looks get in the way and tend to cloud their judgement of him as an actor, and a vastly underrated one at that ) but this movie was excellent but it did have a familiar Forrest Gump feel to it, but I felt that the love story between Benjamin and Daisy was what gave the movie the quasi- Forrest/ Jenny treatment.  The rest was just sheer joyful agony, Imagine that... what if we were born old only to die young, with the personality and emotional changes reversed just like everything else.  I can honestly, wholeheartedly say one thing:  for those of you who fear death, which I know everybody and every living creature that has a soul on this planet does, this wonderful film should be required viewing so we can feel good about getting old and just enjoy our lives as they were meant to be lived by us, and we should just be happy in our skin.  I WILL NEVER, EVER forget this movie and especially Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the starring roles.  This movie will be on the silver screen in my mind when I'm 80 and have lived a full life, and I hope closing my eyes for the last time will be just like when I opened them for the first time.

3754201,1,B001PO5N6G,"F. Scott Fitzgerald made ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" a poignant but whimsical and often funny tale of a man born old who grows young. Hollywood twists this short story beyond recognition.

In Fitzgerald's version, the father is discombobulated but takes his gray-haired, withered newborn home and has him dye his hair and otherwise try to masquerade as a young 'un. The film father tries to drown and then abandons his son. Fitzgerald's Benjamin woos and marries the belle of the ball; as she ages, he uses his burgeoning energy to attend parties and master the latest dance steps. In the big screen version, romance ends in tragedy.

Thus does the film convey Hollywood's idea of a serious message, to wit, ""Life sucks, then you die."" Some reviewers have noted the similarity to 1994's FORREST GUMP. Was that the last time a Hollywood movie with a happy ending won Best Picture?

Every character in this film, if you pay close attention, has had major loves, losses, and most have continued beyond the expected END, in so many instances. Hope , faith and love replace the regret that can cripple the willingness to go beyond the human expectation of others.

Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are at the top of their performances, far surpassing their duo in Babel. There  was much more chemistry and honesty in their performances in this film. My only regret was the audio when Ms. Blanchett is talking to her daughter and near death. Yes, I realize she must have had a stroke but many lines were not understandable. Julia Ormand was wonderful and it was fabulous to see her again after so much time.

It is true that everyone wishes for a happier time, a time of great love, holding a loved one who is alive, a simpler time in history, a clock that could take us backwards to a joyous moment but that is the essence of this film- LIVE LIFE NOW and live without regret. Loving everything on this human roller-coster ride called LIFE will show us how to  ride without ever giving up.  EVEN IF OTHERS TELL US WE WILL NOT SURVIVE- POPPYCOCK! As long as we share our stories, we live in the hearts of those we love and if they pass that story on, as in this film, love will live forever.",1243728000,2,1578,4.439446366782007
3754224,3,B001PO5N6G,"Overall, the costumes, make-up, special effects, and acting are all top notch, but the story line, which sounded so original, felt like it had been done before.

It started with an older lady narrating her young love story to her daughter, and I'm guessing the writer was watching Titanic when they thought up this premise.  However they must have changed the channel when they came up with a young naive child and his unconditionally loving mother.  He has trouble fitting in with other children.  They all look at him like he's different, except for young Jenny or whatever her name was.  At least the poor kid didn't have leg braces, instead he had arm braces and in almost a miracle he just wills himself out of them- it makes you want to yell `Walk Benjamin, Walk!'  Then he hangs out with adults, but still being at a child's mental state, seems to be a little slow but has a good trusting heart.  Later he meets a grumpy drinking Lieutenant, I mean Captain, and they work on boat a together.  They even fight in a battle with the Captain fulfilling Lieutenant Dan's original goal.  Also Kate/Jenny gets caught up in her artsy/hippy crowd and only comes back to Ben/Gump when an injury/sickness happens and he can take care of her.  Another coincidence occurs during a special moment when Brad sees his old lady friend on tv swimming.  It's the dyslectic version of Jenny seeing Gump running on tv.  And finally the writers must have changed channels again and the Notebook takes over- I'll leave it at that.

However, what ultimately swayed me away from this long movie was the main actresses who played Brad's love interests just weren't attractive.  Even though they are two of the best actresses out there, they just don't make good lovers on screen.  They weren't as bad as The Dark Knight's leading lady, but falling in love with the Notebook, Titanic, or Gump's leading ladies was much more desirable.  So overall I do not recommend buying this- a rental at best.  However if you think you'll like it based on previews, then you will probably like it.",1243555200,,2064,4.673130193905817

I'm not a Brad Pitt lover, but I feel he deserved the Oscar nod for his amazingly detailed performance.  Alexandre Desplat's score was last years best (and one of the most interesting in recent memory), and the rest of the cast and production values are top notch.

Many people are complaining that it's slow and long. That's still OK with me if the movie has something interesting or new to tell. It's really annoying to see it to be so 'Forrest Gump'-style and so pure sugary syrup. The idea of reverse aging could have been interesting if treated differently, but now when I think about the movie, it just makes me chuckle.

3754227,4,B001PO5N6G,"The curious thing about THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that no one seems to think Benjamin's case is that ...well ...curious. But I'm jumping ahead of myself.

This film is really all Brad Pitt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn-After-Reading/dp/B001JIE7JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn After Reading</a>). He so controls the entirety of it that you simply could not picture anyone else doing that role but him. Pitt is, after all, a fine actor. Probably one of our finest out there at present. Things like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babel/dp/B000MCH5TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Thirteen/dp/B000W1V7K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Thirteen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B000067J1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>&nbsp;have helped elevate his cinematic chops. But never before has so much attention and time been given over to a character that is purely Pitt's. He is on-screen for most of the film's substantial 166 minutes. And he is fantastic to watch.

The curiousness of it is that Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born old. Really old. Arthritic, full of heart disease and wrinkles, Benjamin's early life is wrought with problems. His mother (Joeanna Sayler) dies giving birth to him and his father (Jason Flemyng) is so distraught and disgusted by Benjamin's appearance that he leaves him on a vacant porch-step. He is taken into a house of elderly people where they are cared for in their waning years. And as Benjamin's time passes, his body mutates into a younger and younger man. He finds himself in adventures on the high-seas, and travels the world. But one thing he never seems to forget is his early love of Daisy (Cate Blanchett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-m-Not-There/dp/B0013D8L7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'm Not There</a>). Their on-and-off relationship is the only thing that keeps Benjamin semi-grounded in reality. His life is odd, but not so much for him. Although aging is a natural process, Benjamin just happens to be doing it backward. The big question for everyone is ""What happens when Benjamin's time runs out?"" Will he vanish into a zygote?

It is most disturbing (to me as viewer) that no one in the medical community decided to study Benjamin. They just completely accepted the fact that he was aging in reverse and that was that. No news media hype that Benjamin needed to run away from. No pokes and prods by the medical establishment. Nothing. I understand that time was of the essence when telling this story, and that it needed to be more human interest than anything, but I would've liked to have seen SOMETHING or someone curious enough to think this oddity worth studying.

Regardless, this film is quite good thanks to Brad Pitt's amazing performance and the incredible make-up effects (Greg Cannom won the Oscar for Best Make-Up and rightfully so). It is also great eye-candy to see the period sets and costumes through the ages as Pitt and the rest of the cast age into the more modern world.",1243382400,,3258,6.015086206896552

Now when I think of it, all three movies have in common the theme of aging, loss, memory, inevitable death and dealing with it. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the most technically accomplished, refined, and cinematically stunning of the three. It is based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald's short and little known story but it only has in common with the story the title, the main idea, and I believe as a tribute to Fitzgerald's more famous work, the name of Benjamin Button's eternal love, Daisy who was played amazingly by Cate Blanchett. The story in the film is Eric Roth (Oscar nominated script) through and through and it is obvious that he used the same approach and the same device as in his Oscar winning script for Forrest Gump. Does it make BB a bad movie? Most definitely, no. Even if it easy to spot the similarities, BB is a fantastic movie on its own merits. It is a work of art for all its duration. It is a moving dramatic story of love, longing, and losses of one ordinary man with the extraordinary condition. Yes, the film is long and it does not rush. But the film of such beauty can and must be enjoyed even if or when the story would stall for a while. The performances, the virtuoso directing by David Fincher, the incredible flawless work by the teams of make-up artists, visual effects specialists, and by the specialists in Art Direction departments have surpassed any and all possible expectations and achieved an incredible result. According to my rule of thumb, any film with Cate Blanchett is worth watching. I've been her fan for years, and I love her as the actress and admire her as a person and the most beautiful woman in the world. Her work in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Brad Pitt belongs to the best screen romances ever and if anything, the film will be remembered for some of the most beautiful and memorable romantic scenes ever filmed. The night scene in NYC with the silhouette of dancing Cate has entered my personal vault of the most beloved film treasures. I loved the film. I know it may not be perfect story-wise but I don't care. There is much more to it than the story.

The acting was superb, the plot interesting with twists and turns that I didn't predict.  For me, the movie went by fast.

I think a key to this movie is that you either like it or you don't and you will know within the first 30 minutes or so.

I thought the special effects were amazing and I loved the psychological development of the characters.

Watching the extras on the DVD is interesting, although time consuming.

When you watch this movie more than once you pick up on different nuances that you didn't notice the first time.  I suppose that is always true, but seems more so with this since there is so much detail.",1243209600,5,728,4.388059701492537

3754234,5,B001PO5N6G,"The movie starts out with a middle aged woman taking care of her dieing mother in New Orleans shortly before and during Hurricane Katrina in 2004. The woman Caroline wants to make her mother more comfortable so she reads from the diary of Benjamine Button (who is her father) who had an interesting life.

He was born November 11, 1918 (the day WWI ended) His mother died giving birth to him and he looked so old that his father left him on the steps of an old folks home. An African American woman who worked at the home took him in an raised Benjamin as her own. As Benjamin grew he started looking younger and younger. When he was about 12 Daisey the 8 year old granddaughter of one of the residences came to visit. Benjamin and Daisey became friends then.

When Benjamine was in his mid to late teens (but still looked about 70) he worked on a ship and became friends with the Irish sea captain who ran it. During his time on the boat Benjamin was stationed in Moscow and had an affair with a married English lady who was many years older than him. Shortly after this he saw action in the Pacific During World War II and saw many of his friends die.

He came back to Louisianna and got back in touch with Daisey who became a dancer during the war years. They kept in touch and Benjamin went to Paris to help Daisey out when she was severly enjured in a car accident.

Shortly after the accident Daisey came back to Louisianna and Benjamin and Daisey began their realationship. They lived together for several years before Daisey became pregnant and had a daughter named for Benjamin's mother.

Catherine (the daughter) grew normally and after a few yearsn Benjamin new that he had to go away because it would not be fair for Daisey to have to raise both their daughter and him at the same time.

Benjamin left and Daisey continued her life as a mother and dance teacher, getting married to a man that Catherine thought was her real father. Benjamin kept in touch and when Catherine was a teenager came back to see them.

Over the next several years Daisey saw Benjamin as he regressed into a teenager, and little boy and finally a baby who died in her arms in 2002.

All in all a very powerfull story with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett giving amazing performances as Benjamin and Daisey.",1242950400,,2290,4.422802850356295
3754235,1,B001PO5N6G,"I was drawn to see this movie because I actually saw some of the filming of the beach scenes (a one minute clip in this 166 minute film) in the US Virgin Islands.  Yes, that is where this very small snipit was filmed.

I went into this movie with high expectations.  The idea of reverse aging, in theory, seems like it could yield some interesting stories and a unique plot.  But, the entire movie languishes -- think Driving Miss Daisy on ""slow mode.""  While the stories effectively show the spectrum of age and the difficulties one faces along that spectrum, the plot is plain and overly somber.  I understand the philosophical intent of showing what really matters in these character's lives -- swimming the English Channel, getting struck by lightning, and finding love.  But, this point was not made with any flair or with any unique perspective.  For instance, the Benjamin Button character takes on a very shy, quiet personality and his life story is just not that interesting.  He wanders through his life seemingly depressed at his state of being and removing himself from his love for the sole point of making her life better.  While it is a sad romance that he and his ""normal-age"" love could not be together because the age reversal created problems, the story makes me feel as though I have gained nothing from seeing it.  What message was in this film?  That life is short and you need to make the best of it.  Or is it that memories, not age, are important.  In either event, the message I took away is why waste your life on this piece of trash film.  If I could reverse time, I certainly would not!

Check out Driving Miss Daisy, Forrest Gump, and the Notebook instead.  You'll see three movies that are much better and more entertaining.",1242950400,21,1755,4.609677419354838

3754237,5,B001PO5N6G,"I just watched this movie from start to finish and I feel that no matter what is said, Brad Pitt gave the best performance of his career. Oh he's good in other roles(The Ocean Trilogy for one), but in this movie, I can see the age progression, the changes between the two lovers, oh it is nothing short of phenomenal. Seriously. When I got to the end of the film, I didn't feel depressed, I didn't feel much. to be honest, I cannot explain it. I sat and watched a movie of two people who were moving in two different directions which made me feel sad for them. When they were at their best, they gave the love they needed to one another. But at the end I felt nothing but some sadness for them, but again I realize that the two were there for each other when they were there for each other. One thing that intrigued me was the buttons at the beginning of the movie with the movie company logo; that was cute. I was ticked with Benjamin's father because he wanted to toss that baby to its death and if it wasn't for that cop asking questions, he would have. I am glad to see that he came to terms with him though and did the right thing. I was a bit ticked that no one would reach him when Queenie passed away. An oversight? what is this? I must say I was quite impressed with the movie; I can see why it got the accolades it did; I am sorry it didn't get the Oscar but in spite of that lack, it's still a very good film. A darn good film.",1242777600,,1438,4.031468531468532
3754238,2,B001PO5N6G,"So many movies these days feel the same as Hollywood recycles ideas over and over again.  This movie had a unique plot which was certainly a plus.  The idea of a person growing young was an interesting idea to explore, the cinematography was visually pleasing and parts were rather amusing.  Other reviewers have complained about inaccuracies and things that could never happen.  These pieces of the story don't bother me,  though, because the whole premise of the movie is a totally fictional idea--a man is born old and grows young; that is something that has never happened and never will, so who's to say what would ""really"" happen?  I do have to admit, though, that when Benjamin grows chronologically old (physically young) he does seem to take on both infant AND aged characteristics at the same time which only puts him in a worse position and I found that a bit frustrating.  But, like I said, this is all fiction, so who's to say the way it would or wouldn't be?  Also, some reviews complain of a meandering story line that is hard to follow.  I disagree.  The story isn't told in a conventional way, and perhaps you have to think a little bit to follow it, but I thought the very slight variation in presentation was refreshing.

So why just 2 stars?  I don't like walking away from a movie feeling depressed which I certainly did on this one.  Just this aspect was enough to knock off a full 2 stars.  The movie is full of lost opportunities, both forced and voluntary separation from loved ones, and a lack of satisfaction.  There is a brief period in our main character's lives where they are together and both very happy, but it is such a short season in their lives.  Really, they could have been together and have been happy like that for much, much longer but through a combination of their circumstances and their own choices, they are not.  I found this especially depressing since I didn't agree with the characters' choices.  I also found it terribly sad in the end that Benjamin becomes senile and can't remember who Daisy (or anyone else) is nor can he remember anything about his life,  and yet he is a small child and Daisy still has to take care of him.  And although chronologically Benjamin is eighty-something when he passes away, he has the body of an infant and it is very sad to me to see an infant die (perhaps that's just because I'm a new father <wink>).

Another star was lost for all the sex.  I don't remember any explicit scenes, but boy does Benjamin have a lot of sex in this movie.  That got really old really fast.

To sum up, if I were to compare this to another movie or two, I'd say it was a mix between Cast Away (mood) and Forrest Gump (story style).  If you really liked both of those movies, you may like this one.  If you didn't, then I suggest you spend your time doing something more productive than watching this movie.",1242777600,3,2874,4.489402697495183
3754239,4,B001PO5N6G,"I won't recount the plot here as many have already done so. This movie has its uneven points that I'll get to in a bit, but in general, I found it to be a little different than usual and somewhat thought provoking. Imagining a person aging backwards makes one think about issues of life and death as well as what it takes to enjoy life at any particular time. In that sense this is an interesting movie to watch. Now for the bad. First of all, I found the dialog in this movie difficult to hear for some reason. I don't know if it's the accents or background sound in the movie or what. While a lot is made of the portrayal of the aging, I found it to be a bit uneven. At times it seems like the Benjamin charater de-ages at the wrong pace. He seems to get young too fast in some cases. There were a few things in the movie that were interesting but seemed a bit out of synch with the movie like the Hurricane Katrina setting for the present-day storyline, the clock that goes backwards made by someone who doesn't appear to have a lot to do with the outcome or the string of fate sequence leading to an accident for one of the characters. Finally, one of the big disappointments for me was the fact that it seemed like long streches of the movie were somber sequences that left out many interesting possibilities. In spite of the insinuation that this character did a lot in his life, he actually does surprisingly little in the movie, and the age peculiarity actually is developed surprisingly less than it could have been. I also didn't find the love story to be terribly believable or the two characters to have a lot of chemistry, but somehow it sort of works in the end for what the movie is trying to achieve I think. This certainly isn't one of the best movies ever and I find it hard to see myself watching it a second time, but it was definitely worth seeing.",1242777600,,1869,4.2824858757062145

I don't know HOW people are saying this was like Forest Gump. They're nothing alike, past both being great movies.
The tone of the movie is completely different. The language formation isn't anything like Forest Gump either. Clearly, the people who think so either saw something I missed, or (I think)just didn't get the movie.
Clearly, its a story about something that hasn't actually happened and more likely than not, never will. That aside, the characters are as believable as any other fiction of this sort if not more so.
I also didn't think this move was about his ineveitable death so much as what he did while he was alive. The ultimate 'you may never see tomorrow, so do what you can with today' movie. If you were depressed with the turns in this movie than you missed the whole point.

3754243,3,B001PO5N6G,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" was inspired by the short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald, though the film resembles it only in name and subject. Benjamin Button is a man who lives life backward. He is born old and dies young. Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) of the film is born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1918. His mother died in childbirth. His father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng), thinking the infant deformed and anguished by his wife's death, leaves the child on the porch of a senior citizens' home.  The home's housekeeper and caregiver Queenie (Taraji B. Hensen) cares for the baby and calls it ""Benjamin"". She assumes little Benjamin won't live long, but, instead of growing more feeble, he grows younger. He leaves home at age 17, looking about 70, to see the world.

This movie is 2 hours 45 minutes long, presumably so we feel the years pass as heavily as Benjamin does. If only I were that much younger by the end, it might have been worth it. The premise of a person growing younger is an opportunity to comment on aging, age's social implications as separate from its physical realities, how those change over the course of 80 years, etc. But ""The Strange Case of Benjamin Button"" doesn't seem to comment on anything. It's an excuse to be sentimental for nearly 3 hours. The dialogue is artificial and trite. People say things like, ""We are meant to leave the people we love. How else would we know how important they are?"" and ""I was thinking that nothing lasts, and what a shame that is."" That's this film's idea of profundity. And of conversation.

There are some redeeming features. Taraji B. Hensen always brings a vitality to her roles. The old folks home is charming. The film morphs into a tearjerker in the last 20 minutes and is successful as far as that goes. But characters are all two-dimensional. Benjamin's relationships are shallow. There is no hint of chemistry or depth of feeling between him and the love of his life, Daisy (Cate Blanchett). Everyone and every thing seems to be a device, leaving no real characters or story. There is a point where Benjamin appears to age about 25 years when he would have only aged 12. That might be insignificant if a major plot point didn't hang on his age. It doesn't make sense. What we have is an overlong piece of speculative fiction that doesn't do much speculating.",1242518400,4,2361,4.643540669856459

The movie looked odd to me from the beginning. But I started reading a recap of it on IMDb and it intrigued me. I got about two paragraphs into a full recap (barely getting into any anything about Benjamin) before deciding that the movie looked really interesting and that I wanted to see it.

So I rented the movie Friday night.

It's nearly a three hour movie. With a movie that long, a slow start can't be afforded, but I got an hour into the movie before becoming so bored that I had to give up. The movie was just so dull and boring, going nowhere, which is a shame, because it was such an interesting premise for a movie (aging backwards) yet the movie fails so miserably by never going anywhere.

3754255,3,B001PO5N6G,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a gimmick movie that reminded me of ""Forrest Gump."" We knew that Forrest was kind of slow in that movie, but why does Benjamin seem so dense in this one? Just because he's growing young backwards doesn't mean that he has to be slow-witted which he seems to be as played by Brad Pitt. In reaction shots he seems to a have a vacant, vacated look.
The World War II naval combat footage was very well done. I was particularly struck by the New Orleans setting and the approach of Hurricane Katrina because I, too, lived through that storm and have sad personal memories. At one point as Benjamin, a dwarfish old man, struggling up the steps reminded me of Jose Ferrar as Toulouse-Lautrec in ""Moulin Rouge.""
The old lady lying in bed, Daisy played by Cate Blanchett, is listening to her daughter's reading of Benjamin's journal, and she is reliving her past with Benjamin as the hurricane nears.
The nursing home scenes and Button's relationship to his adoptive mother Queenie struck me as poignant.
To me it was not one of Pitt's best performances. The special computerized effects in which technicians were able to age his face and features were remarkable.
The reverse aging device, adapted from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story, wasn't enough to draw me into the story even though individual sections of the film were outstanding.",1242432000,,1366,4.767932489451477
3754256,1,B001PO5N6G,"Very depressing story.  Brad Pitt didn't make the story seem even semi-believable.  I felt the acting was mediocre at best.  Cate Blanchett was the only one in the movie that carried her weight.  The scenes with Pitt as an old man were very hammy and the visual effects were horrible.

SPOILERS AHEAD!
The story is about a man who is born looking old.  His mother dies during child birth and his wealthy father is appalled at how he looks so he leaves him on the doorstep of a house.  An African-American woman keeps him and tells everyone that a cousin died and she is going to raise her son (Pitt) for her.  This woman works for a nursing home so he fits in with all the patients in the home - until he gets older and starts looking younger.  It is at this nursing home that he meets his future bride for the first time.  They get in trouble for spending time together since he looks like he's 80 (but is actually around her age) and she's only about 9.  She leaves and doesn't return during her younger years.

Eventually, he leaves to find his place in the world; has an affair with a married woman; then is reunited with the love of his life when he returns to the nursing home to visit his ""mother"". They end up getting married however he only spends a very short amount of time with her.  He then leaves both her and their child since he's getting younger and she's getting older and he's not sure how to deal with it.  She remarries for the sake of the child and moves on in her life - always seeming to pine for him in a way.

She finds him many years later when he looks about 16.  She introduces him to their daughter, and then he leaves again.  She then finds him again many years later and must care for him as a child and then as an infant.  She is an old lady by then.  To have an infant die is terribly devastating, even knowing that he's lived his life and is truly an old man stuck in an infant's body.  This was probably the most disturbing part of the movie.

The love story is lacking and should've had a greater part in the movie.  There were no warm fuzzies with this story.  There was no chemistry between the two lovers and it just leaves you feeling cold.

I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are into very depressing movies that leave you feeling helpless and hopeless.",1242432000,26,2303,4.253456221198157

  Thus begins the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher (the director) takes us on a journey of a man who learns everything in reverse. He is ignorant while still an old man, and as he ages backwards, he becomes more knowledgeable and mature. We see Benjamin meet many people, all of whom he touches and changes their lives in some way.

A beautiful movie to be seen by all. Cate Blanchett was beauty in motion and Brad Pitt was powerful in heart. As a reminder of the trivial things we overlook in life and the importance of unselfish caring, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie to not only watch but own.

With solid CGI combined with breathtaking cinematography, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was akin to watching a canvas of renaissance era oil painting come to life on the big screen. It's not just a should see, it's a must see and you would be doing yourself a disservice as a movie-watcher to skip out on this one. Director David Fincher, normally directing darker films like Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac, hits a homerun with this drama and with the talents of Cate Blanchett (one of the greater character actors of our time) and Brad Pitt, it was easy to like this movie.

""They said I was gonna die soon but, maybe not.""

Benjamin Button is an odd man who lives a life not unlike our own but strangely enough his aging is in reverse. The internal mechanics of his humanity are familiar in every aspect but his outward appearance is what makes him unique. Benjamin Button ages in reverse, starting out as a wrinkled ""old"" baby, he grows into a hansome man and in his twilight years reverts to teenager, child and then baby. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button details the life of Ben as he is outcast for his looks at birth to then falling in love as an adult. His journey showcases many of the entertaining aspects of the early 1900s without force feeding you the basics of life during that time.

Without giving away too much, I will say that You will get a sense of Forest Gump from the transition of time as the cinematography details about five decades of American history with a splattering of comedy here and there. While most other movies depicting this time period focus heavily on America's ugly racist ways, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button focuses specifically on the people in Ben's life and does not veer away from the important elements. It is a unique experience in that motion and seeing the strength in Benjamin as he copes with rejection and acceptance leaves you with a lesson about forgiveness. It is one that we all need to be reminded of.

Huge acting, stellar cinematography and music that keeps you focused and attentive to the story, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a great movie.

Greg's Candid Opinion (Spoiler Warning)
Beyond the story and the fact that two of my favorite actors are in this one together, I love this movie for one more reason. For a span in Ben's life he has all the money he could want, he has a woman who is crazy about him and he has no other obstacle but time in sharing life with her. So what do they do? They f-ck like drugged rabbits for like 10 years straight, seriously, it was like: groceries, sex, eat, sex, cuddle, sex, walk out by the lake, sex, dinner, sex, rinse - repeat. It reminded me of college days when I spent many days at the apartment of my girlfriend at the time and life slowed down immensely for that entire semester, it was a great memory and it made me understand the happiness that Ben and daisy both felt with the freedom of just living , and having sexual freedom. How sexy was Cate Blanchett in this movie? Sheesh.

3754261,5,B001PO5N6G,"I am a sucker for an epic movie and I swore when Titanic came out twelve years ago that it would be a long time before another movie could come along and top it. With The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, that has finally happened. This film is so endearing and wonderful that I am not even sure which words to use to express its merits. In many ways, this film reminds me of both Titanic and Forrest Gump, two movies that are rife with humor and sadness--two films that do storytelling on a grand scale.
Furthermore, the cinematography is at times breathtaking and the musical score is absolutely perfect. In my opinion, this film is the highlight of Brad Pitt's career. Cate Blanchett, as usual, is stunning.
This is one film about which I can say ""I laughed and I cried,"" and mean it. I saw it last night as a Netflix selection and am glad my husband was already in bed. This means he'll want to watch it tonight, and I will be ""forced"" to watch it again. I can't wait.
I cannot recommend this film enough. Positively stunning and unique.",1242345600,,1040,4.393782383419689

A story about a man born in his 80s and who ages backwards, the movie begins with an old lady dying in a hospital bed.  Her daughter is by her side while a major hurricane is approaching.

We move to a story about a couple whose son died in the war.  The heartbroken father designs a special clock for the railroad station whose hands move backward, in the hopes of turning time back, so all the sons lost in the war can return home.  Of course, no one else appreciated the man's noble idea.  He disappeared in disgrace.

Back to the hospital scene, Mom gives her daughter a book to read, the story of Benjamin Button (played by the talented and handsome Brad Pitt).  About 1920, a woman is dying of childbirth.  The father is overwrought when he sees his son, not only because of his wife's condition but also because the baby looks like a little old man.  He grabs the baby and runs.  Unable to throw him in the river, he abandons him on the doorstep of a single woman's home.  A doctor examines the baby and declares he is dying of old age diseases and does not have long to live, but the woman takes pity on this poor ugly child and decides to love him for whatever short time he has left.

As time continues, Benjamin slowly begins to grow younger and straighter.  He meets a young girl (about age 12?) and they become great friends.  After all, Benjamin is really a child in an old man's body.  The young girl grows up to be Cate Blanchett, ""the woman he is destined to love forever"" as it says on the DVD case.

This is not an action flick, but the story of a very unusual man and the events surrounding his life.  In that respect, it is a slow-moving flick but it is a good story with good actors, and very much worth watching. It is also a love story, about a woman's love for a very different child and about a couple who are very much in love.  It's also about forgiveness, and about determination.  Tired as I was, I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish watching it.",1242259200,,2061,4.317708333333333
3754263,3,B001PO5N6G,"This is an adapted screen play, not a faithful following of the original F.Scott Fitzgerald, but that is not the criticism. The story line is true, simply updated to contemporary times. Pitt and Blanchett are both quite good in their roles. The criticism I have with the film is in the directing. Several of the scenes are shot in shadows or half light which make it difficult to see all the details. Certainly this was a conscious choice by the director - but why? Same criticism with the dialogue - too much of it was spoken in soft tones and mumbling, which made it difficult for me to understand. I don't believe that the problem I've noted is me, as my eyesight is 20/20, I don't wear glasses and I have no problem with my hearing. It seems to be the way the director chose to make the film.",1242172800,3,796,4.348993288590604
3754274,5,B001PO5N6G,"This movie leaves me speechless. If you decide to take the movie as depressing then it will appear that way. Fortunately I see the movie differently, it is an odd combination of love and death with an underlying motivation to enjoy life. When faced with adversity BB decided to survive and enjoy life. He experiences everything he possibly can, a lesson all of us could internalize and apply to our lives. There is a lot of death but the movie clearly demonstrates reality, we all are touched by death in our lives and this movie is not afraid to show it. Once again BB meets the challenge and embraces death as does Cate Blanchett. It happens what can you do? Love also is a major focus, a childhood love that remains and survives amongst time, ages, distance, and appearance. Amazing graphics and an exquisite and fascinating story. This movie makes you think about life and death and how you can embrace both and have a balance in your life. Wonderful!",1242172800,,955,4.623529411764705

3754276,3,B001PO5N6G,"I wouldn't knock anybody out of line to see this movie, but it does have a fascinating quality nonetheless. Benjamin Button is born with what appears to be Progeria. He's an eighty year old toddler. So peculiarly, he begins to grow younger as he grows older. The special effects (seeing Brad Pitt as a fearfully wrinkled child) are impressive.

The story (based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story) has the quality of a roman fleuve. Benjamin wanders the world as he grows younger and wiser. The love of his life (Cate Blanchett) and he have a passionate but sometimes celibate lifelong love affair, but are ultimately pulled apart as they age in different directions.

Pitt's a passable Benjamin, and Blanchett is curiously so-so Englishly flat as Daisy (another F. Scott Daisy!), but the real downside to BENJAMIN BUTTON is its resemblance in the second and third reels to FORREST GUMP. I joked to my companion that ""Life is like a box of chocolates,"" and only later found out that the same screenwriter did both scripts. So there.

Sadly, the FORREST GUMP-ness of BENJAMIN BUTTON really robs this film of a wonderful chance to be memorable: What happens to you if you grow wiser and more experienced as you grow younger, stronger and more capable? What does a man do with his life when he's born at eighty-five and knows the span of his years? By treading safe ground and eating chocolates, BENJAMIN BUTTON makes of itself an utterly forgettable film.",1242086400,,1456,4.792828685258964

Benjamin invites us into the experience of being an outcast in the age of youth oriented worship.  In this outer limits like film, Brad Pitt brings to life a character by the name of Benjamin who has so little identity that he floats across the screen innocently recreating that invisible person that every one of us has been made to feel like at some point in our lives.  Creatively, Benjamin carves out a unique and fascinating life for himself.  From undesirable beginnings to being an uncontrollably desired object of affection Brad Pitt delivers a knock out performance bolstered by his ability to use non-verbal facial expressions and body language to render you helplessly compassionate to his fate.  To compliment this cinematic dive into the digital special effects canvas is perhaps today's prima movie star, the Goddess herself, Cate Blanchett.  Ms. Blanchett delivers a performance that leads the story line into a realm that only the actors of decades past could create.  This motion picture delivers it's message to the viewer in such a way that heart strings are played sensuously like a Spanish guitar.  With lighting reminiscent of silent film, Tilda Swinton plays the glow of 2 a.m. encounters of lustful passion as if it were her only sustenance.  Yes, we root for Benjamin.  We root for love, in a way that could only be conjured by past masters of the screen.  For todays younger audience this is a romp into an unknown secretive world of passion. BRAVO!",1242086400,,1680,5.476744186046512
3754278,4,B001PO5N6G,"Although throughout you feel the movie stripped heavy inspiration, pathos, and motiffs from Forest Gump, the movie is detailed and well crafted.  Surprisinly, for 165 minute length, I didn't feel the movie dragged, but instead was decidedly conscientious of not over explaining and thereby propeling the narrative forward.  There are some logical gaps, but the characters are engaging and have a certain amount of charm.  Benjamin's inheritance was an easy excuse to fund his vagabond lifestyle, and the Paris accident was another fairly indelicate deus ex machina. Conversely, the overly-elder Benjamin special effects were shockingly excellent and whimsical.  A solid, but not classic release
that does have its meditative moments.",1242000000,,733,5.636363636363637
3754279,4,B001PO5N6G,"I saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in the theatre about a week after it was released to critical acclaim and talk of Oscar. Expecting a masterpiece, I left the theatre very unsatisfied. I felt I had just watched ""Forrest Gump 2,"" sans the entertainment value of that film. I admired The Curious Case for it's scope and beauty, but was very disappointed with the story, especially with the amount of critical acclaim it was getting. I initially thought it was the most overrated film of 2008. When the Criterion Collection released a 2-disc special edition of the film, I reluctantly returned to it to see if I'd missed something.

Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and the screenplay for Forrest Gump (the ladder being uncredited of course), The Curious Case opens in a New Orleans hospital where an elderly woman is dying as Hurricane Katrina rolls in. Her adult daughter begins reading aloud from a journal written by a man named Benjamin Button, who was ""born under unusual circumstances."" As the woman's narration fades into a Louisiana-accented Brad Pitt's, we learn of how Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) discovers his wife dying after giving birth their son. When he sees the child, he panics and drops it on the steps of an elderly-care home managed by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), who accepts the wrinkled, unhealthy baby as her own not expecting it to live very long. Years later, Benjamin (as he's named) is seven, looks seventy, and is confined to a wheelchair. Living among the elderly, Benjamin meets the granddaughter of one of the care home tenants, Daisy, and falls instantly in love.

As Benjamin brows older (and his body, younger), he longs for adventure and takes a job on a tugboat captained by Captain Mike (Jared Harris). After leaving home, Benjamin quickly racks up plenty of life experiences including an affair with Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton), the wife of a British Trade Minister. Their brief affair of course leads to a delayed, profound, and predictable effect on Elizabeth's life.

Of course, we watch as Benjamin goes through almost everything one can go through in their lifetime, but everything leads back to Daisy (played as an adult by Cate Blanchett).

There are sequences that are spellbinding, such as the intentionally aged scene involving Mr. Gateau (an unrecognizable Elias Koteas), the clockmaker and the sequence showing unrelated events creating a sort of domino effect.

The plot is the biggest issue I have with this film. Eric Roth, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00005LC4Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>, wrote this screenplay. Had another writer penned this script, Roth likely would've sued him for plagiarism. The plot structure, Benjamin's experiences, and Benjamin's and Daisy's relationship are so similar to Forrest Gump, it wouldn't be a stretch to call this film ""Forrest Gump 2."" The essential difference is that Forrest Gump, while having an array of memorable characters, was an event movie; what situation would Forrest find himself in? ""Benjamin Button"" is a character movie; what situation will find Benjamin? Guess which film is more entertaining.

The most unoriginal thing Roth did was use a hummingbird as symbolism. The feather (from Forrest Gump) and the hummingbird represent the same thing in both films. Roth's script is possibly what kept this film from a Best Picture statuette.

Script aside, Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore; 3-hour character studies with no real balls-out action or visual effects that mainstream audiences are accustomed to. However, this film has Oscar-winning visual effects that are truly incredible. Brad Pitt plays the seven-year-old Benjamin Button all the way through his mid-twenties (or sixties, depending on how you look at it) and I was amazed to find that his face was digitally applied to smaller actors. This effect is incredibly impressive and there's not a single flaw. Makeup effects are stunning too. It's fascinating seeing Pitt go from an old man to early-90s Pitt.

The art direction of early 1900s New Orleans is absolutely beautiful; becoming a sort of picturesque, swampy paradise, with the beauty of a painting.

The cinematography is all digital, including the coloration for the scenes that take place long ago. It never looks like it was made to look old, but simply is old. The ""struck by lightning"" scenes look like old silent film stock (these are probably the sequences shot on 35mm, mentioned in the accompanying Criterion booklet). The cinematography is masterful and should've won the Oscar.

Not a single actor is miscast in this film. Pitt is an underrated actor doing some terrific work here and Blanchett has a timeless beauty and classic quality that fits any era. Henson more than deserved her Oscar nomination as Benjamin's strong-willed adoptive mother.

David Fincher, who has directed audience favorites&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000050FEN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B0007DFJ0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>&nbsp;has directed his most mature effort here. This film is evidence that Fincher will very likely pick up an Academy Award one day for his direction.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button explores themes of love, time, aging, etc. All were explored to much greater effect in Charlie Kaufman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Synecdoche-New-York/dp/B001P3SA8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Synecdoche New York</a>, a superior film. This film will no doubt appeal more to a mainstream audience as those themes are presented in a much clearer way here.

Upon second viewing, I didn't dislike this film as much as I did before. It's a beautiful, very well-made film that's just not as good as it could've been. It's certainly not one of the best films of 2008, with it's Forrest Gump by way of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Fish/dp/B0001GOH6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Fish</a>&nbsp;storyline. With it's flaws, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is still a monumental achievement of filmmaking.

Cate Blanchett was amazing as Daisy--her character was lively, vivacious, and stole the presence of the movie more so than anyone else. It can be a heavy movie to digest because it revolves around the theme of life and death, the phases of life, and time.

The curious case of Benjamin Button is something very different, very surreal. Told from the perspective of an old child, who becomes a young man, the story is about life and, most importantly, death. Exposing the viewer to the different views that people have on others who are ""different,"" one can see how Benjamin (Bradd Pitt) is affected by all of the events surrounding his unusual birth. Living in an elderly retirement home, Benjamin is shown how death is constantly affecting the life of many people. People come, and they go. Of course, this film is not only about the glooms of life, but also about love. In the eyes of Benjamin, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is his perfect damsel. The intriguing part of the story-telling is how the couple come to meet in different points of their lives. Seeing their relationship grow is certainly peculiar, an old man, who is a child, falling in love with those gorgeous blue eyes. This film is not just that, but rather a fusion of art and movie making. The cinematography, the editing, the pacing, the music, it all comes together, woven in perfection, creating a world where there is bad, but plenty of goodness and love. Director David Fincher knows how to get his audience what they want, an amazing story with incredible acting and pacing. By the time the credits roll, we realize that we were taken on a journey, full of life, death, love, and most importantly, that no matter who you are, life treats you the same. This is a film for the ages, one that will be studied for many years to come.

The Blu-Ray:
Whoa! As soon as I saw those buttons falling, forming the Paramount and WB logos, I was stunned. From the get-go, this film is reference material on Blu-Ray. All of the special effects, CGI or prosthetic, looked impeccable, and this Blu-Ray helps boast these effects at home. There are no artifacts or any blemishes, considering the films was shot on digital cameras. Perfect picture quality!
The audio is another great aspect of this BD. A talky film, dialogue is always prioritized, but when the rears need to kick in, they do. Bass is powerful, when need be, and the subtle atmospheric effects are always present. A wonderful DTS-HD MA mix. Overall, a solid, demo-worthy disc, courtesy of Criterion.

It's looooooooooong.

It's Forrest Gump in reverse, only without the grand spectacle or sense of historical involvement or human connection. It has no soul. The reverse aging is a gimmick with no real purpose or meaning.

At the end, you get the feeling that not much has happened, and slowly.

I admit it has great visuals and effects and sense of period, but to what end? Each event and encounter left me wondering, so what? Who cares?

Forrest Gump's adventures and interactions showed us how silly we are, or how shallow, or how much better we could be, or what was important in life. Benjamin's, on the other hand, don't seem to point to anything at all - it's empty. In the end, nothing has been accomplished apart from an expensive exercise in backwards-aging Brad Pitt; you feel that you have gained nothing and experienced nothing.

No, wait. There is one thing to be gained, near the end, when he's a kid again, demanding his breakfast. He uses a vulgarity but the scene - all of 4 seconds - is hilarious (and sad at the same time). But that hardly makes up for 3 hours of nothing.",1241568000,6,1164,4.492890995260663

Since 1988, the producers of `The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON' have been trying to get this film made.  First in the hands of Steven Spielberg, the director became too busy with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Jurassic Park"" that the script was passed on to a variety of writers, directors including Ron Howard and Spike Jonze and talents that were up for the part such as Tom Cruise.  It took almost 20 years to get this film made but fortunately, everything came together when David Fincher (""Zodiac"", ""Panic room"", ""Fight Club"", ""Se7en"", ""Alien 3') took on the director's helm for this film.

With a unique screenplay by Eric Roth (""Ali"", ""Forrest Gump"", etc.) and Robin Swicord (""Practical Magic"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", etc.) and the casting of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, these names behind the the 2008 film would prove to be magic, not only in box office sales but also to be nominated for 13 Academy Awards (winner of ""Best Achievement in Art Direction, ""Best Achievement in Makeup"" and ""Best Achievement in Visual Effects"") and grossing over $329 million worldwide.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

When it comes to ""THE CRITERION COLLECTION"" releases, I have not been disappointed.  The company prides itself in releasing a film with the original director's intention.  Also, making sure that their releases are quality releases.

For ""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON"", there were a few segments shot on 35m film but the majority of the film was created in the digital realm, without ever being output to a film element and transferred.  The film was shot on the Viper FilmStream and Sony F23 Digital cameras and color corrected by Jan Yarbrough on FilmLight's Baselight system.  This High Definition master was converted directly from the Digital Intermediate color space to SMPTE Rec.  709 24 frames-per-seond at 1080p.

The video quality is absolutely gorgeous.  Blacks are black.  No signs of scratches, dirt or artifacts.  Having been shot on digital video, ""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON"" sports magnificent video and just a variety of colors.  You can see the details in every scene and this is just a film that sports stellar picture quality.

As for audio, the original theatrical sound mix was optimized by sound engineer Ron Klyce for home-video listening.  The audio is featured in DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless.  Although the film is primarily a dialogue film, everything from the rain and wind (recreating Hurricane Katrina) to the sound of the boat on sea, the crickets, the sounds of Louisianna and hearing the jazz music in the French quarters, the machine guns and tracer rounds during World War II, every channel on your home theater is utilized.  Of course, this is not an action film  but nevertheless, the film sports crystal clear audio and for scenes that utilize background sounds to the action scenes, you're getting the best audio presentation.

So, both picture and audio quality are magnificent.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Now, this is where ""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON"" continues to shine.  I don't think I have seen the filmmaking process covered so much in detail than what is presented on this Blu-ray disc and because of that, this is one of the best releases in terms of special features that showcase the filmmaking process.

DISC 1:

Audio commentary featuring Academy Award-nominated David Fincher -  David Fincher is one of those director's that is very detailed on the filmmaking process.  For those who love to hear about the direction and what one wanted to accomplish, this is where you find out the details on what is behind-the-mind of this director.  David Fincher's commentary was great!  The pacing was good and he kept delivering with details and what he wanted to accomplish.  Very well-done commentary!

DISC 2:

The second disc features the bulk of the features and this disc is packed!

  * The Curious Birth of Benjamin Button - This segment allows you to watch a near 3-hour feature of the making of the film but I highly recommend viewing them separately because there are segments that are separate from the ""Play All"" feature.  I will have to say that this is the most detailed special feature I have seen on Blu-ray that covers the filmmaking process.  Each feature is quite lengthy, informative and anyone wanting to get into film or appreciate the filmmaking process is going to love this segment.  Here is what is included:

- THE FIRST TRIMESTER

  * Preface - (3:08) Director David Fincher discusses his involvement of the film and discussing how the death of his father and the emotions that he had, came to play in directing this film.
  * Development & Pre-Production - (28:56) Kathleen Kennedy (Producer) and Josh Donen (Former Executive at Universal) discuss how they have been trying to get this film made since 1988.  How it landed in the hands of Frank Oz to Steven Spielberg, to Ron Howard and then Spike Jonze and rewrite after rewrite and nearly two decades later, having David Fincher directing the film.  Very informative details on the pre-production phase.
  * Tech Scouts - (12:21) This segment features the various scouting locations for this film.  ""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON"" features so many locations and so many time periods, that this was going to be a challenge for the film and crew.  But everything worked out (especially in post-production) in making these locations come alive for the characters.
  * Storyboard Gallery - Storyboards of the locations
  * Art Direction Gallery - Gallery on the art direction of the film.

- SECOND TRIMESTER

  * Production Part 1 - (26:09) This featurette includes the casting process and interviews with the cast and behind-the-scenes making of the film.
  * Production Part 2 - (29:03) This featurette features interviews with Donald Graham Burt (Production Deisgner) and the creation of external parts of the homes to make things look authentic of that time period, creation of the tug boat to the silicone casts.  As well as creating a feel of winter with ice and snow during the month of May and everyone interacting with the director.
  * Costume Design - (7:38) Interview with Jacqueline West (Costume Designer) of recreating the various genres and using actual photos from that time period and the script as a way to come up with ideas.
  * Costume Gallery - Gallery of costumes for the film.

- THIRD TRIMESTER

  * Visual Effects: Performance Capture - (7:41) Interviews with Editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.  Assembly of the sound and how they interacted with the Director of what worked and what didn't work.
  * Visual Effects: Benjamin - (16:55) One of my favorite features on how they did the face replacements.  Interviews with Eric Barba (Visual Effects Supervisor) and the various production meetings they had in getting things right.  Interview with Paul Lambert and Janelle Crenshaw, Compositing Supervisors of Digital Domain.  How they would capture Brad's face, use of silicone masks and how one wanted to quit because what the filmmakers wanted didn't seem possible.  But they managed to make it happen.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON"" is a fantastic film!

The pacing of the film takes its time and thus it is told in 165 minutes but it's the gradual ride of watching Benjamin's life unfold in our very eyes through the various decades.  To watch the people that touched his life and vice versa, but then once you get to the third leg of the film where he and Daisy are now around the same age and fall in love, you just anticipate how things will end.

Screenwriter Eric Roth knows how to captivate the audience.  He manages to slowly pace things in a format that many may compare to another film which he wrote, ""Forrest Gump"" but is anything but.  The acting of the talents are just amazingly well done and makes every scene come alive.  Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett are both magnificent in this film but the supporting actors, may it be Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abbot for her scene with Benjamin in Russia or Benjamin's mother Queenie played by Taraji P. Henson and even Jarrid Harri as Captain Mike, each of these characters contribute to this movie and have all brought something special.

With the direction of David Fincher, screenplay by Eric Roth and the acting sequences to be tremendous, the film continues to marvel with its beautiful cinematography and what was created technically via visual effects.

""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON"" has gone farther in technical achievement and pushing veterans in their field to do what was considered impossible.  Every scene featuring an elder Benjamin Button to the ballet dancing Daisy, were all other talents but with technology, the ability to take Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's face and mannerisms and digitally make things come together.  Everything looks realistic.  And nothing looks fake, the virtual world looks realistic.

This crew had to capture the 1920's all the way up to the present and everything from scouting locations, visual effects, costume design, set design everything came together fluidly and looks so amazing!  And the fact that nearly everything was created digitally, the high definition transfer of the film was absolutely perfect.

Great care went to the visuals, the audio and the fact that this is part of the CRITERION COLLECTION, quality is what we got in all levels and I can't imagine why a cinemaphile would not like this Blu-ray.  It's absolutely reaches perfection on all three levels of picture and audio quality and special features.

""The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON - THE CRITERION COLLECTION"" reaches perfection on all levels for this Blu-ray release.  For fans of film and the creation of film, this is the type of release that one can just be happy with.  You definitely get your money's worth.

Highly recommended!",1241568000,6,13004,4.997204100652376
3754301,4,B001PO5N6G,"You know the story: a baby is born old, and grows younger as he matures.  It's a strange story to bring to the big screen, though with some special effects, director David Fincher (and ain't this an odd movie for him to man the helm of) manages to pull it off.  The script does a fairly adequate job of tackling the issues that go with such a story: the old man falling for the young girl; the numerous awkward encounters and amusing-yet-touching ""growing pains.""  The love story, too (which becomes central to the film during the second half) is rendered effectively.

The problem is that the film lingers; it's a bit too long for it's own good.  This is a major error, of course, but it's at least partially forgivable: the film is beautiful to look at, from the ballets to the war scenes.  It's just a bit regrettable that there is so much of it...it becomes a bit overwhelming after a while, a bit too much of an emotional impact.  Still, note the 4 Stars in the review.  That's largely due to the caliber of acting presented here.  Pitt is the central figure, of course, and he's as riveting as he's been in most of his recent movies.  Cate Blanchett is a marvel as always, carrying herself with poise and dignity.  Tilda Swinton has a good few scenes as the uptight British woman Pitt falls for in a hotel; Jason Flemying, as Button's father, is another standout; and Jared Harris, as the captain of a tugboat, is simply fun.  The real scene-stealer here, though, is Taraji P. Henson, as Button's adoptive mother.  She shines, definitely deserving that Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress.

It's a bit too long for the plot, and very indulgent on the part of the filmmakers, but THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is definitely worth a look or two.  It's moving, emotional, and definitely a sight to behold.",1241481600,2,1816,4.561728395061729
3754302,5,B001PO5N6G,"The clock runs backwards-that is the opening symbol of the movie, a clockmaker whose son is killed in WWI creates a clock that runs backwards so all the boys killed in the war can live full lives. When I was a kid I thought life was something you had already experienced and you were telling the story to somebody, and that is the structure of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

The story is told in flashback form, mirroring the life lived in reverse theme. An old woman dying in a hospital as hurricane Katrina rages outside the hospital, as the woman's daughter reads a diary by Benjamin. Benjamin is born as WWI ends, his mother dies in childbirth and his father discovers the child is born as an old person. He abandons the child at an old people's home and Benjamin grows up, but he's also growing younger at the same rate he would grow up. Benjamin fits in at the old people's home, when someone asks him how old he is and replies 7, they think he's just an old person with a great attitude. As Benjamin grows chronologically older he experiences some of the same experiences as a child would, a growing sense of wanting to know more about the outside world. He meets Daisy a beautiful red haired, blue eyed girl who is about 8 to his 12 and introduces him to a curiosity about girls, even though Daisy's grandmother assumes he's a dirty old man. In his late teens, Benjamin notices he's growing younger and he inadvertently gets a job on tug boat that takes him on a series of adventures around the world. He's promised Daisy to send a postcard from every place he visits and he lives up to his promise. His adventures as a sailor carry him through World War II, and when he returns home he's starting to look noticeably younger and when he runs into the Daisy he discovers she's now a young woman in her early 20's and a dancer, and she's as in love with Benjamin as he is with her. Unfortunately, life doesn't allow us to be with the person we're in love with, at least not at first. Their love becomes the love of a lifetime and all the time Benjamin becoming younger as Daisy ages and they're able to meet in the middle. As Benjamin becomes younger the movie demonstrates that childhood and old age aren't that far apart in experience. At the end of the movie we see the magic of love and how chronology isn`t everything in age or love.

Brad Pitt as Benjamin is absolutely solid in the performance, it's nuanced, there are no pyrotechnics in his performance but he's believable at every age of Benjamin from a man in his 80's to a teenage self. Cate Blanchett as Daisy continues to be a chameleon on the screen, ably playing a young woman, middle aged, or as Bob Dylan, or even Katherine Hepburn. Taraji Henson is worth mentioning as Benjamin's mother, she's a talented actress whom I first noticed in Hustle & Flow gives another fine performance here.

The screenplay is by Eric Roth who also wrote Forrest Gump and while there are some similarities, but it's not the same type of movie where Benjamin's adventures have him bump into every famous person or event during his lifetime. Benjamin's adventure through life are less ostentatious but no less important in quality of a life lived. The story is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story and in certain moments you can still see the genius Fitzgerald's talent assert itself.

The DVD edition is a one disc set and there are no bonus features or commentaries, there just may not have been room due to the length of the movie.",1241481600,3,3500,4.481191222570533
3754303,3,B001PO5N6G,"Hollywood has made enough big, sweeping 'lifetimes-condensced-in-two to three-hours' movies, that things had better leave a really,really, really powerful and lasting impact or you'll find yourself doing what I did, literally hitting the fast forward button to get to the gist of each the overly staged, overly dramatacized 'life stages' , that started becoming super predictable. It's like, ok, here we're going to see Pitt's father come back into the picture and reconcile, then later die. check. Here we see his tug boat captain, and later we'll see his demise.check. ...here we see Pitt's mother who raised him, who is signifigantly older now, and by then you KNOW it's a matter of time before we see her funeral, check. ...Here we see his wife suddenly have an unannounced out of the blue change of heart and move back to new orleans (but by now, your not surprised), check....Oops , did I give this movie away? Yes, the gravitas of each stage of the movie becomes less and less as literally EVERY scene is overwrought with lifes 'big moment's'...it started to take away from any poignancy it might otherwise have had and made the whole movie feels like a run of the mill hollywood flick, with the typical melodramatic shtick. That was a shame too, because the cinematography is spectacular, and all the little attention to period details made this a great movie to look at. Someone mentioned the great liason scenes between Pitt and Tilda Swinton and that was really a great , intimate part of the movie, both storywise and the beautiful and oozing with atmoshpere hotel lobby where they met each night..But as things move on, your hit two dozen times again, scene to scene with stages in Benjamin's life that shoot for that spectacular grandeur and elegance, and then jump to the next stage, that the whole movie starts to loose something and become sort of typical. Kind of a shame. I also think they could have edited the runtime down, it's a bit too long , and probably would've restored some poignancy. The other thing that I found surprisingly lacking, was it never really felt like Pitt's character was engaging...It's kind of hard to describe, but you never got to see any clever or interesting or unique dialogue that would lead his wife and Swinton's characters to gravitate to him...maybe the idea was they just picked up on his 'specialness'. Pitt just kind of 'low-keyed' it through most of the movie, and it's hard to say if that added any realism. In the end , the visuals are truly fantastic, but the 'start to finish' styled retelling of Benjamins story lost steam as it went on.",1241481600,2,2602,4.7844444444444445

3754326,2,B001PO5N6G,"Hollywood seems to be undergoing a midlife crisis. Indeed the box office seems to be yearning for the day gone by with 'recent' pictures such as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', 'The Poseidon Adventure', and the upcoming montage of horror flicks including the new 'Friday the 13th'.
The recent Christmas season brought us another Hollywood 'remake' titled ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" which is loosely based on a very intriguing short story by the great F. Scott Fitzgerald. Now for those of you folks that are still eager to see this you may want stop reading now!! Last Warning!!
At the risk of sounding like that pretentious friend that we all have (let's call him Howie) that says ""Oh the book is so much better!"", I have to agree with Howie.
The Premise of the story is that a man is born old and ages backward until he passes as an infant. The movie is set at turn of the century in New Orleans where Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is deserted by his father onto the steps of a nursing home with a small wad of cash. Benjamin undergoes all the hardship that may be expected of a young man in his eighties. He naturally has a difficult time relating to 'youngsters' his age. He falls in love with a young girl 6 years his junior (he appeared of course to be much, much older than she). He falls out of love with her, ends up in Europe, and decides to have an affair with the wife of an English diplomat. After a while he goes back to New Orleans looking much younger still and rekindles the love of his youth (enter Cate Blanchet). The movie goes on at a slow and very predictable pace until Benjamin dies as a baby with a keen sense that he has been there before. The film tries to make us sympathise with Benjamin but I felt nothing but complete indifference. The directors try to tug -nay yank at our emotions, but all I felt was boredom.
I've also heard certain 'gushy' critics compare Benjamin Button to Forrest Gump. What is it that we loved about Forrest? We didn't love him for his handicap. We loved him because he overcame his handicap to achieve amazing feats and did so without a touch of malice.
A much better version of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is Mr. Fitzgerald's. The story is hardly recognizable and much more comedic with a touch of whimsy.",1241395200,7,2282,4.435714285714286
3754327,3,B001PO5N6G,"Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the type of movie made for Academy Award season. Based on a F. Scott Fitzgerald story, we witness a man who is born old and ages backwards. It is an interesting premise, and the acting is well done. Brad Pitt plays the lead role, and shows off his skills while portraying Benjamin at different ages. Taraji P. Henson gives an academy award-nominated performance as the motherly figure who takes him under her wing, and Cate Blanchett plays the love of his life. The story spans several years, even generations. The makeup department did an amazing job at portraying this. The main issue I have with the movie is that it is entirely too long. By the time the most emotional part of the story came along, it was nearly three hours later and there wasn't enough to keep me interested until then.",1241395200,3,827,4.594594594594595

And then along comes The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a touching tale about a tragic romance spanning the entire lives of two people, one of whom ages in reverse.

The first disc features an audio commentary by director David Fincher. He talks about the arduous task of applying Cate Blanchett's old age makeup and how it affected her performance. He talks about how they avoided sappy sentimentality whenever possible. Fincher also talks about how they cast various roles in the film and what they were looking for. He tells all kinds of interesting and engaging filming anecdotes about the challenges of shooting on location with his trademark dry sense of humour. This is another outstanding track by Fincher as he offers eloquent observations and tells entertaining stories.

As with all special edition DVDs of Fincher's films, Benjamin Button documents various aspects of the production in detail. Entitled, ""The Curious Birth of Benjamin Button,"" this making of documentary is broken down into several digestible sections.

""The First Trimester"" documents the pre-production phase and Fincher kicks things off with a surprisingly moving preface where he recounts the death of his father and how that drew him closer to the material. This section takes us through the origins of the project and how Steven Spielberg almost did it with Tom Cruise. We go through the long screenwriting process that lasted several years. We also see Fincher and his crew scouting locations that would span several years and countries. Also included are storyboard and art direction galleries.

""The Second Trimester"" examines principal photography with all kinds of behind-the-scenes footage. We see several sets being built with various key crew members talking about their work on the film. Several major cast members talk about how they got involved and their impressions of the film and of Fincher's legendary reputation. We also get to see how the tugboat was built on a soundstage where all of its scenes were shot. There is fascinating insight into the elaborate aging makeup. Aspects of costume design are also covered, including a gallery.

""Third Trimester"" takes a look at the film's groundbreaking visual effects. We see, in great detail, how they seamlessly digitally grafted Brad Pitt's face onto other actor's bodies. It is amazing to see just how much work was involved. We also see how they did the CGI for the tugboat scenes and other things, like the background plates for scenes that took place in exotic locations. Other aspects, like sound design and Alexandre Desplat's atmospheric score, are examined. It's great to see Desplat at work and interview soundbites where he talks about his working method.

""Birth"" features footage of the film's premiere in New Orleans with the cast and crew reflecting on the experience of making the film and what it means to them. Also included is a gallery of production stills.

3754332,5,B001PO5N6G,"Very loosely based upon a short story by the great American author F. Scott Fitzgerald, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a beautiful movie that is both personal in focus, but epic in scope. Set mostly in New Orleans, the film follows the life of a baby boy whose mother dies during his birth on Armistice Day, the end of WWI, November 11, 1918. The baby is so deformed that his father considers killing the child by dropping him in the river, but is stopped by a policeman. Startled the father runs through some streets and down and alley and leaves the baby on the steps of the first reasonable house he comes to. It turns out that the ""house"" is actually a retirement home for the elderly and the baby is found by the chief caretaker of the place, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Queenie is unable to have children of her own and decides to adopt the child because even if it does look like a devil, it is one of God's children, too. She names the baby Benjamin and in time he begins to grow. As time goes on it appears that instead of growing older Benjamin is growing younger. Such a curious case that Benjamin Button.

THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON features some extraordinary acting. Brad Pitt gained most of the attention for his performance as Benjamin, but Pitt's performance is really overrated. I'm not saying he doesn't do a good job, but Pitt actually doesn't show up as Benjamin until about a third of the way through the movie. The reason Benjamin Button is so memorable as a character isn't because of Pitt's acting ability, but because of the makeup and special effects. The real star performers in the film are Cate Blanchett as Daisy and Taraji P. Henson as Queenie. Blanchett is one of the best actresses of the age and Henson proves that she is a rising star.

The visual effects, set design, costumes, cinematography, and editing are all notable. In addition, the film has a wonderful score that augments the story that is told. This is the rare movie where all the elements of the movie come together seamlessly as they help create the realistic and authentic world from the past in this fictional tale.

Like most great works of art, there are a several meanings you can take away from THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON. There are some who feel the movie is about death and how one goes about facing death. There is an underlying tone of sadness that pervades the picture. However, this sadness is underlying and isn't always prominent. I believe that instead of death and dying, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is, instead, about living. It is true that many characters in the movie die or are in various stages of death throughout the movie. But as Benjamin tells the audience from his own journal, death is just a part of life. All of us have to die, but it is up to us to choose whether to live or just exist and if we chose to live it is also our choice of how we will live. Death, disease, war, accidents, and lost love are all a part of life, but despite the sadness and sorrow life truly is beautiful and the world is full of wonder if we only choose to see it.

It should be noted that there are two versions of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON available on DVD. If you are looking for just the movie with no frills, you'll want to purchase the single disc version. However, if you're a bit of a cinemaphile or are a huge fan of the film, you'll probably want to check out the special two-disc version that has a ton of special features, including interviews, featurettes, and special coverage from the film's premiere.",1240531200,,3569,4.469325153374233

3754344,4,B001PO5N6G,"When one suspends disbelief anything may be possible. This is what the screenwriter, Eric Roth is banking on as filmgoers tread through the turnstiles to view this somewhat serendipitous form of artwork. Roth installed a similar mystic formula with Forrest Gump, and what a success it was. Button may not be as effective, but is of superior quality to say the least. This being said, the two Roth screenplays stand alone on their own merit, and should be adjudicated separately.

There is a subtly smooth poetry attached to the dynamics of the picture. I found myself enthralled by the effective musical score. It is one of the best I've ever been entertained by in film. Though the length of the film is a staggering 167 minutes, the time spent is critical to the plot and story. Enigmatic yet talented director David Fincher uses these minutes to allow the story to regressively age much like the main character. Those who attempt to deliberate the story with rhyme or reason will assuredly be repelled by the films length, viewing it as an ordeal. However, the suspension of disbelief has its privileges, and the imaginative will cherish the extension.

The cast is exceptionally talented, including Cate Blanchette, Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson, Julia Ormond, and Elias Koteas. All performances by the aforementioned were well done and very professional. The trouble for me is that some were too professional, and with a hint of starch. The most engaging from this group was Julia Ormond who plays Daisy's forlorn daughter. Swinton delivers an illuminating depiction as one of Button's lovers. Taraji P. Henson, playing Benjamin's mother, proves to warrant 'major force' status in cinema. As for the intricate Mr. Button, Brad Pitt unleashes a rock solid performance; displaying a fine texture of consistency and veracity from age 70 to 17.

So often it occurs, where screenplays for fantasy and romance type films become stuffy and arduous, but this wasn't the case here. Screenwriter Eric Roth never attempts to enlarge upon the essential intimacy of Benjamin Button's private hell vs. the grand nature of the surrounding events. The characters are uniquely capsulated and do not overwhelm the story. Equally admirable, is the editing, which is transitionally effortless. The cinematography, art direction, and set decoration are all outstanding. Visually, this is astonishing and superb film making.

Depending on one's sense of imagination, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button may lead you along for an enchanting expedition or a dismal expos. Pertaining to self, it was the former.",1239926400,2,2593,5.166666666666667

3754346,4,B001PO5N6G,"Director David Fincher employs spectacular cinematography, subtle digital photography and the backdrop of one of America's most unusual cities to film an extremely loose adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and manages to fascinate his audiences as they glimpse at one man's life even though the film's running time stretches on for an almost excruciatingly uncomfortable two hours and 47 minutes.

The film's premise revolves around being born old and living life in reverse. It flirts with the idea of being dependent in the beginning and at the end no matter which way one starts out putting more of an emphasis on the years in the middle where we are responsible for ourselves and can fully savor and enjoy the moments we create as if they are mini works of art. As illustrated by Benjamin's exploits, all the people that flow through one's memory with their stories and viewpoints help formulate all those big questions whose answers defy identification and perhaps are rendered irrelevant when thought about in context with little perfect pearl moments that group together to fashion a necklace of experience that reaches beyond larger absolute ideals with the tangibility of the senses rather than that of solely the intellect.

Most important of all, perhaps, is the notion that as we move through life at times we walk with others who move in the same direction. Their time with us is ephemeral yet relevant to what we need at the time as the ultimate and lingering wisdom they impart provides a building block to our progressive development. Sadly all relationships, good and bad, are fraught with the same fragile rule that all things--be it a mother, father, lover, child--must pass.

The fact that main protagonist Mr. Button, played with a pleasant insouciance by Brad Pitt, begins as an infant octogenarian complete with cataracts, arthritis and heart disease adds an obvious nuance to the curiosity factor that an audience would possess for any character that is depicted on the big screen. While a definite amount of curiousness does describe a life that begins old and becomes younger as time progresses, the actual aspect of viewing life and the world as a vehicle in which to exercise and expand one's natural curiosity amplifies what could be only the strange subject of a sideshow to a larger platform of universal proportions.

The players in this assembly more than adequately come together with a synergy that emphasizes that the sum of the parts do indeed create a whole that exceeds each individual piece. During the first person narrative of Benjamin's story, the focus on Cate Blanchette's (Daisy, Benjamin's main squeeze) face manages to convey the inner loveliness of a character that matures over time from the more selfish thoughts of self, to thoughts of Benjamin, to their shared life together and then most beautifully later on to those who need her most. In a smaller role, the typically androgynous Tilda Swinson glows like a nascent star with a complexion awash in the soft light one would affix to one about to fall in love again and explore another human being.

In the same vein, the city of New Orleans beams with its own special personality and that hint of mystery that one cannot see by just scraping the surface. For once, the filmmakers do not over do the Creole/Cajun flare of Southeast Louisiana with the usual blare of Bourbon Street jazz and Southern-fried bayou caricatures that depict the city and its environs in an extreme light devoid of appeal but long on kitsch. Instead, New Orleans is filmed as it is with a quiet diffused hauteur and distinct character that no other city in America possesses. The shotgun houses shine in clapboard glory; streetcars gleam with old-fashioned charm; Lake Pontchartrain births a brilliant tangerine and pink grapefruit sunrise adrift with placid waves in balmy air that suggests a private world of privilege that those still mesmerized by the third world images circulated during Katrina will fail to recognize. Only insiders see New Orleans from this perspective. An Oscar nod here for the lovely whimsical cinematography that utilizes an `Amelie' quality (sepia sequences, reverse photography, etc.) during certain segments to add comic relief (the seven strike of lightning) and to stress the coincidence in little events that domino effect into something larger and more consequential.

Where the film fails is in its telling of Benjamin's story as Daisy's deathbed disclosure. This overly sentimental contrivance seems more appropriate for the Lifetime or Hallmark Channel rather than the lead-in for a plotline that has a hard time balancing its wonder and its sorrow. The shadow of Katrina looming in the near future adds nothing but insult to injury, reminding the audience of the current plight of New Orleans of which the Bradelina brood, as relatively new citizens, have taken a special interest. Perhaps the filmmaker intended to yet again emphasize the idea that yes, relationships do come to an end. Daisy and her daughter (Julia Ormond) must say `goodbye.' On a larger level, Katrina's destruction will sever ties to a city, to family members, to beloved pets and homes that housed generations. More akin to the story, Daisy's daughter must bid adieu to someone she barely remembered; the pain of this is left open-ended. Only Benjamin with his backwards look at the world has the dogged complacency to handle all the death that crosses his path without going ballistic-fatalistic, but then again he was pretty much born dead. We are expected to believe that a young precocious child would be chemically attracted to a wizened old man with a child's height--now that's a bit of a stretch. Confused images of the storm, hummingbirds and the ironic joke of the clock intended to reverse time muddy the waters further--none of these recurring ideas are really given substance or actual definition--they just appear whimsically like Benjamin himself.

Bottom line? ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' can be long and at times seem like a long airplane flight where occasional stretches up and down the aisle are essential to survival. Thinkers will question the relevance of the main character's curious ailment and ponder over the various messages the film seems to throw out. Blanchette wows as the lovely Daisy while Pitt uses his celebrity to sing the praises of his adopted city during his celluloid evolution from shriveled oldster to . . . none other than Brad Pitt. Recommended.

3754347,5,B001PO5N6G,"This is an amazing film in every way. From start to end, a dazzling experience.

We all know the story: Benjamin Button is born as a monstrous, ugly baby. As he grown into a child, we see he is not just ugly. He is 80 years old... and aging backwards. At the same time the love of his life, Daisy, is growing up to become a world class dancer. As they both grow, their lives and experiences drive them apart... until they meet later in mid life, where they finally experience the same maturity. But obviously, as the aging process keeps its course, they must part again.

Thematically, this is a subtle tale of two people in love who are destined to meet again and look after each other even being in different stages of their lives. Or a story of a love that must be tested to the extreme.

But this is just one of the film's triumph. Visually, the film is striking as we see Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett getting younger and older with amazing special effects. That element alone is an experience that deserves to be seen.

This film boosts every production value you can think of and even those who do not like the genre or the themes must admit this is an amazing accomplishment.

The cast is superb. Brad and Cate are just the tip of an impressive row of great actors: Tilda Swinton (always astonishing), Julia Ormond, Elias Koteas, Jason Flemyng and the amazing Taraji P. Henson as Queenie, the woman who runs a nursing home and decides to take young Benjamin left at her doorsteps.

There are several thematic points of encounter between this film and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>&nbsp;and they are pretty clear if you think both films were written by the same screenwriter (Eric Roth). But the universe of these stories is very similar and those thematic points are unavoidable: the lone character that goes thorough life alone, the moments of happiness that cannot last and the many ways the world turns bringing two people together or away from each other.

STILL, this film is a winner in its own right and deserves the attention of any one who's looking for something different and amazing. Mr. Fincher really did it!

This film will be available in three editions:
DVD single disc,
Criterion Collection 2-disc DVD edition,
Criterion Collection 2-disc Blu-ray edition (the obvious choice).",1239408000,,2417,4.965346534653466
3754348,5,B001PO5N6G,"I absolutely LOVED this film from the writing to the acting
to the cinematography and cutting edge special effects!
If this had been any other year, instead of a year of many
extraordinary film performances like MILK, DOUBT, THE READER,
SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, THE WRESTLER, THE CHANGELING, ETC.,
then THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON would've swept the
awards shows and been the dominant movie of the year!
But it was also the year when the powers that be decided
to uplift the underdog...and so that's why films like
SLUMDOG, THE READER, AND THE WRESTLER were given an audience
that they otherwise might've never had in a regular year
of film-making where big budgets & names usually rule!
All that aside, this was a fantastic piece of work and
Brad Pitt definitely gave an Oscarworthy performance!
Taraji P. Henson was also fabulous as his big-hearted
surrogate mother and deserved the supporting actress Oscar
or at least the Golden Globe  for her performance.
Cate Blanchett was also fantastic as well!
The innovative special effects and cinematography, which I believe
did actually win an Oscar, were deserving of it because they really
raised the bar!--I can't wait until this 2-Disc version comes out
so I can see what they did behind the scenes.
Some people criticize this movie as a ""Poorman's Forest Gump""
but they are completely missing the point and level of sincerity
and originality this movie possesses!
I believe time and DVD release will vindicate this movie being dissed
by the Oscars, SAG & GOLDEN GLOBES by the many fans who will enjoy
this truly special piece of film history!--It did well in the
box office too!",1238889600,4,1634,4.920289855072464
3754349,5,B001PO5N6G,"Although I though this film should have definitely won the Oscar for best film of 2008, it still does not top Fincher's all time masterpiece, Fight Club.  Whereas Benjamin Button is a seamless work of narrative, historical context, make-up magic, and visual effects on par with any summer blockbuster, Fight Club had one of the most poignant antiestablishment messages of the 20th Century, and will take its place alongside the masterpieces of that time period.  Now, this film is an absolute delight to watch, even as it breaks your heart.  No real scientific explanation is given for Benjamin's condition, although the philosophical side of the story tends to lean toward predetermination and poetic justice.  The real meat of the story is seeing the two love interests' lives intersect, while both realize they are doomed from the start.  The aging make-up and CG effects are astounding, it's really tough to tell sometimes where Brad Pitt ends and the computer imagery begins.  As everyone knows by now, the 2nd half of the film is a heart breaker, watching Benjamin devolve into a senile child, until the tear jerking ending, made all the more resonant by the approach of Hurricane Katrina, which I felt really symbolized the death of the New Orleans these characters knew throughout their entire lives.  The final shot was both chilling and comforting, bringing closure to an epic story that will go down as one of the saddest romances in film history.",1238716800,2,1458,4.9753086419753085
3754350,5,B001PO5N6G,"The career of David Fincher is to be highly commended, and it's about time he got an Oscar nom. My first notice of his career was ""Alien"", not liked by many, but my 2nd fave in the Alien series. Certainly, Ridley Scott was inventive with the first Alien movie; James Cameron blew it all out of the water with ""Aliens"". Both directors were establishing their early efforts well. ""Alien"" was Fincher's opportunity to create new stuff to the franchise; after ""Aliens"", that was a tuff act to follow. Still, he created a world that was new, different and gave Sigourney great chances to kick alien butt. I liked it even better than the first. I was made aware of Fincher; darkness, intrigue and a new style of film-making. Then I saw ""Seven"", and many others by Mr. Fincher, and, finally, ""Zodiac"", which I thought brought his purity of thought to fruition.  Well, I watched ""Benj Button"", and I knew it was a long film, but with the background of the admiration I've grown to expect from Mr. Fincher, I was open for any amount of craziness done with class. Fincher succeeds. A bizarre story, indeed, dark overtones abide in a relatively simple and sweet story. Love is everywhere, and a driving force throughout. Love, as seen through the eyes of every person involved, is not taken lightly; mortality is second. Love of a child, a mother, a lover, a comrade, a teacher...ALL well-examined. I repeat, I was never bored for a minute. I'm an older male, and could relate to the material. It's a very bizarre story, but in the hands of David Fincher, and his brilliant screenwriters Eric Roth and Robin Swicord, it all makes perfect sense. The flawless editing of Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall puts everything in a perspective to keep it all coherent. Then there's the performances, not a weak link in the bunch. Brad Pitt has been criticized for not being ""present"", but he handles the complications very well. I really loved Cate Blachett; all the rest, Taraji Henson, Tilda Swinton, Julia Ormond among others, all perfection. This is a film that will live on as a lesson to film-makers. Taking an impossible story and making it plausible...well, I'm impressed and have no end of admiration for this film.  UPDATE: I have the 2-disc Criterion DVD, and it's fine. Some of the extras explain too much of the FX, which might destroy the magic for some. I really love this film.",1238457600,3,2367,4.6875
3754351,5,B001PO5N6G,"Wonderous movie that captivated me from the get-go. Which surprised me a bit, since I wasn't overly interested in seeing it, despite the rave reviews. Boy, I was wrong. It's been a long time for me that a 2-1/2 hour movie has gone by so quickly - with so many movies today, I get antsy around the 1-hour mark. Not this one - with it's superb acting and special effects, and especially it's great storytelling, it was like a great book that I couldn't put down",1238198400,5,459,4.348837209302325
3754352,5,B001PO5N6G,"Upon first introduction of this film, we know that it is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The short story tells of a boy born as an old man who, within a few hours can talk and act as such. To avoid embarassment, Benjamins father forces him to dye his hair and play with the local children as a real child. All Benjamin wants to do is read, smoke cigars and have adult conversations as an adult would. Being a short story, you cannot really expect a feature film to be wholly adapted from it, you have to expect massive changes and extensions in order to present a worthwhile and fluid picture to be enjoyed by the masses. What would likely be a film under 1 hour long if it was adapted word for word from the story, we were presented with a treat of a 2 and a half hour story told from the death bed of an aged Cate Blanchett in a pre-hurricane New Orleans hospital.

To start off the story we are presented with a metaphorical plot device in the form of a train station clock running backwards, which was made as a hope that it would mean all the dead soldiers of the first world war could come home alive.

The story as told to Daisy (Cate Blanchett) by her daughter reading from a diary is that of Benjamin Button, an incredible man whos mother gave her life for and was abandoned by his father (Jason Flemyng). He was born with the appearance of an old man, with all the ailments to boot. He was left on the porch of a New Orleans nursing home to be found by one of the nurses known as Queenie (Taraji P. Nelson), she adopts him and christens him with the name Benjamin. Throughout his early childhood Benjamin is expected to die any day due to the illnesses he has and the way he looks, so is forced to live in the home as if her were one of the elderly relatives.

What Queenie starts to become aware of is that as Benjamin gets older, he does not get weaker and sicker as predicted but he's getting younger and fitter. Whilst still looking old but being about the age of 7 he meets a girl who is the daughter of one of the elderly residents known as Daisy. They become friends but cannot be around each other too much due to what he looks like (quite frankly I'm glad they didn't take it any further too early as it was a bit creepy). As Benjamin grows older, he meets his father again, but is not told who he is. He just thinks he is a friendly stranger who offered him a ride and a drink at a bar. Benjamin then moves out to enjoy the adventures of life and is forced to deal with some adult adventures he wouldn't experience if he looked his age.

What I can really say about this film with whole hearted honesty is that I absolutely loved it. From start to finish it felt genuine, the maternal love of Queenie for her adopted son came across as authentic thanks to the sublime acting of Taraji. The affair scene with Tilda Swintons character, (although I truly dislike the woman as she looks like someone who was repeatedly hit in the face with a dog by a tramp, and sounds like the queen if she smoked 5 packets of cigarettes a day) is done really well and you get the feeling that Benjamin (Pitt) is genuinely falling for her.

Apart from the main plot of Benjamin Button being quite heart wrenching at times, the sub plot of an aged Daisy keeping herself alive until the end of the story is told is quite something. The make up, setting and in some cases special effects all come together well to present a believable setting of a progressive early 1900s New Orleans. The superb performance of Taraji P. Nelson deserves special mention as she now shows the world some genuine acting talent. This has to be Pitts oscar win as for this role it would truly be deserved, however, I would not be surprised if it were highly overshadowed by 2008s biggest blockbusters.",1238025600,4,3791,4.281729428172943
