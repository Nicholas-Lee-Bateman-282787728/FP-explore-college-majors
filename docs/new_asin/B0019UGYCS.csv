3444027,4,B0019UGYCS,"The dog deserves an Academy award, and the satirical skits on Hollywood are great. It certainly was thrilling for me to see the stars of the 1930's & 1940's in the 1970's. Favorite gag- a pitchman says to a studio executive- ""How about this idea for a movie, a tornado takes a girl from Kansas to a fantasy land where she meets a man made from tin, a lion, and a strawman."" Executive- "" Will you get out of here!""",1216080000,12,413,4.175

3444030,5,B0019UGYCS,"Jonny Weismiller as a stage hand? Just one of many scattered throughout this movie. Movie itself is enjoyably funny. Madeline Kahn, Bruce Dern and Terry Garr main characters. Besides the dog of course. Buy it, you'll like it.",1403481600,,225,4.947368421052632
3444031,2,B0019UGYCS,"When I saw this movie in the theater I was wowed by the number of cameos of old Hollywood stars still alive in the 70s. I bought this DVD because Netflix doesn't carry it. What was I smoking ...er... thinking back then? The movie is nothing without the cameos, which aren't as terrific as I remember. And in all those years I still haven't changed my opinion about Victor Mature or the Ritz Brothers -- who, comedically, make Mr. Mature look like Groucho Marx. I had such a star crush on Madeline Kahn in those days, but even she and Bruce Dern couldn't save this turkey...I mean...dog of a movie. And, yes, by the end of this second viewing I even hated the %#$@ dog.",1400716800,5,668,4.352
3444032,1,B0019UGYCS,The only saving grace of this unfunny comedy is spotting the many movie stars of the 20s-40s who appear in cameos.  The film is devoid of wit and charm and gives the impression the director and actors were making up the script as they went along.  On my Ten Worst Comedies of All Time list.,1388966400,,290,4.254545454545455

3444035,1,B0019UGYCS,This dvd was of such poor quality. It did not play to the end. It continually would start and stop. The defects became more frequent as you got into the film. It spoiled what could have been a pleasant viewing. It was not worth the money. If all the copies are as poor as this copy it should not be sold.,1377734400,,304,4.0
3444036,5,B0019UGYCS,"1976 saw the release of Won Ton Ton The Dog Who Saved Hollywood, and it  is very good. I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre. Cameos were done by some of my favorite veteran stars Joan Blondell, Yvonne De Carlo, Tab Hunter, Ann Miller, and Barbara Nichols. A film you can watch with anybody.",1374710400,3,297,4.2105263157894735
3444037,3,B0019UGYCS,"This movie was recommended by a friend; I had never heard of it before.  I was therefore floored by the list of stars it features.

It's a waste of acting talent, though, with no discernible character development in the script and direction.  It is funny in places, and holds up a mirror to some of Hollywood's foibles (such as producers backing many bad sequels to a hit movie rather than taking a chance on any of the good story ideas that have to be out there).",1374192000,3,464,4.372093023255814
3444038,5,B0019UGYCS,"A fun movie with many cameos. I found it hard to identify them all. The comedic acting is great, and Madeline Kahn is just wonderful; nice to see her in a good role.",1373328000,2,165,4.03030303030303

3444041,2,B0019UGYCS,"I'm watching this almost 40-year-old film for the first time and I haven't read any reviews.  But I have to say, and I'm probably quoting, ""The hero is a dog and so is the film.""",1333065600,,178,4.085714285714285

3444043,5,B0019UGYCS,"Won Ton Ton:

This is a fun movie - especially for adults who remember the old time Hollywood stars.  It's not a tear-jerker, it's not deeply intellectual, it's not a slasher type, it's just fun.  If you love the movie stars from the past you almost have to look at it twice to recognize them all.  Cameos, cameos, cameos!  Buy it!",1254528000,7,331,4.360655737704918

3444045,3,B0019UGYCS,"OK, it was funnier when I was in college. Or maybe old age is getting me and I just thought it was.  This could have been such a great movie...great story but no plot after 20 minutes.  Glad they used so many Silent screen stars...but the movie lost steam as they tried to be clever. It never works but the studios keep trying...Might be good for the kids or if you want to see Buster Keaton and peers, some for the last time...",1229731200,,428,4.144578313253012

3444047,4,B0019UGYCS,"WON TON TON, THE DOG THAT SAVED HOLLYWOOD (1976) is a story set in silent-era Hollywood of a starlet, a hack screenwriter and a German Shepherd. The script is slight, but the cast memorable:

Bruce Dern/Madeline Kahn/Art Carney/Phil Silvers/Teri Garr/Ron Leibman

With cameos by (listed alphabetically):
Robert Alda/Morey Amsterdam/Army Archerd/Richard Arlen/Billy Barty/Edgar Bergen/Milton Berle/Janet Blair/Joan Blondell/Rory Calhoun/John Carradine/Jack Carter/Cyd Charisse/Jackie Coogan/Broderick Crawford/Dennis Day/Yvonne De Carlo/Gloria DeHaven/William Demarest/Andy Devine/Alice Faye/Stepin Fetchit/Rhonda Fleming/Eddie Foy Jr./Zsa Zsa Gabor/Shecky Greene/Huntz Hall/Dick Haymes/Sterling Holloway/Tab Hunter/George Jessel/Fernando Lamas/Dorothy Lamour/Jack La Rue/Peter Lawford/Phil Leeds/Keye Luke/Guy Madison/Victor Mature/Virginia Mayo/Mike Mazurki/Ethel Merman/Ann Miller/Ricardo Montalban/Dennis Morgan/Ken Murray/Louis Nye/Walter Pidgeon/Aldo Ray/Ann Rutherford/Dean Stockwell/Regis Toomey/Rudy Vallee/Nancy Walker/Doodles Weaver/Johnny Weissmuller/Jesse White/Henry Wilcoxon/Henny Youngman

Richard Arlen, Jackie Coogan, Jack LaRue and Henry Wilcoxon were all silent screen stars. Doodles Weaver was a member of Spike Jones & his City Slickers; he narrated their horse race record ""Feitelbaum."" Billy Barty's stage career began in vaudeville when he was a young child. Also here are two of the (then) surviving Ritz Bros. and Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez, whose surprisingly funny guest appearance on Groucho's YOU BET YOUR LIFE TV quiz show led to a film career!

There's too many other names here to go into each performer's resume; it's sufficient to observe that all of these folks had their heydays.

8275328,2,B0019UGYCS,"With all the Old Hollywood stars given cameos, this should have been a film-lovers delight. However, running only
92 minutes, most of these celebs go by too fast to even identify. Many have no dialogue at all ... just a shot
sitting in a chair. And the title is quite misleading. Won Ton Ton (The Wonder Dog) sorta saves just on studio,
which then dumps him. Stars Madeline Kahn and Bruce Dern do their best, but are given almost nothing with
which to work. A sad disappointment, worth seeing only to imagine what coulda been,",1496102400,,526,4.5473684210526315
8275329,5,B0019UGYCS,"I ordered this movie from amazon in the summer and we watched it today. It is a good movie about a german shepherd named won ton ton that really liked an actress named este(madeline kahn). He followed her all over the place. He even found her when she married the bus driver played by bruce dern, who also seen the dog. It has a lot of old time movie stars in, so keep your watch out for them throughout the movie. Won ton became a star in hollywood and even put his footprints in the hollywood walk of fame. It is a good movie for young and old. even your dog might like it!",1474588800,2,575,4.052631578947368
