1102416,5,6305931046,"This is a great Teletubbies video with some laugh-out-loud silly moments and some touchingly beautiful moments, as well.  There are some points of this video that make me realize how Zen the Teletubbies are and how wonderful it is that they have no hidden agendas; they simply enjoy life.  La La feels like taking a walk and asks sleepy Dipsy to join her and when Dipsy says, ""no"", there's no offense taken; La La simply says, ""okay"" and happily goes on her way.  There's a beautiful live action sequence where a guy takes a bunch of kids out to the forest to catch falling leaves.  Dipsy trying to figure out how to get his hat back from the pumpkin is downright funny.  This is a great show for both my toddler and his mama.",1023667200,11,726,4.388059701492537
1102417,5,6305931046,"This is a great production, with age appropriate lessons about seasons. It provides a good Halloween program that's not scary. It teaches please and thank you, and uses a Jack O'Lantern to teach the names of facial features. This video comes with a useful parents' guide. Smiles, laughter, clapping and bouncing by the children were abundant. ""I want to watch it again pleeeease."" ""Now I want to make a pumpkin with leaves and glue."" ""I liked the way they made the pumpkin face."" Best for ages 0 to 2.",1000425600,10,501,4.640449438202247
1102418,2,6305931046,"My 2-year old granddaughter and I are great fans of the Teletubbies. Their programs on PBS and their video tapes which we have previously acquired bring continuous pleasure. However, in The Magic Pumpkin the producer/creators of things Teletubbian have bombed out. There is seemingly endless repetition of unstimulating sequences of foliage being attached to a pumpkin in vain attempts to decorate it. In addition to producing some very unattractive results it is repeated past the point tolerable even by a 2-year old. Worse still, when the pumpkin is delivered to Teletubby Land, the Tubbies never actually have contact with it. This is frustrating to the children who identify themselves with the Tubbies because they, the kids, are deprived of the vicarious experience of interacting the the pumpkin. Save your children and yourselves from this one. Spend your money elsewhere.",991094400,11,881,5.345323741007194

1102472,5,6305931046,This DVD came quicker than we expected it to.  It plays just fine and we have used it over and over already.  Good price for hard to find DVDs that PBS no longer broadcasts.,1248912000,,173,4.0588235294117645

1102474,5,6305931046,"I don't know what makes the Tele-Tubbies characters so interesting to young children but my nephew is mezmerised by them. The redeeming value is that there is basic/simple teaching that is accomplished - ABC's, counting, etc.",1198972800,2,225,5.277777777777778
1102475,3,6305931046,"Not the worst Teletubies DVD, but not the best either.  The cut scenes, (the bits where the teletubies show video on there stomachs) are very ordinary and good candiates for the fast forward button.

The best bit, however, is the pumkin scene itself.  Towards the end the pumkin, magically obtains Dipsy's hat and is quite funny as the Teletubies try to get it back for Dipsy.

As a parent, I think this DVD attempts, in a small way, to teach the kids about ownership and sharing.

If you are looking for a fantastic Teletubies video and have a PAL capable video, then get on to the UK amazon site and get bedtime.  I can't recommend this video enough and is clearly the best teletubbies video by a long way.",1106438400,3,708,4.449612403100775
1102476,4,6305931046,"One night after coming back from a club with my friend Ramon, we turned on the television and saw this playing. We were both drunk among other things. We started watching it and really found it funny and witty, if I had children(which I can't since I'm gay) I would let them watch these DVD's. I really enjoyed the teletubbies, so I'm sure little kids will enjoy it and get something educational from it. Peace.",1097539200,3,411,4.493333333333333

1102478,1,6305931046,"It's amazing to me that this alleged kids troop of televisions infurry jump suits still gets people going. Doesn't anyone realize that our kids should be watching less tv? Don't parents understand that kids who see big furry creatures with televisions as their stomachs will want to watch television more. Shouldn't we be getting our kids to use their imaginations? ALl rhetorical questions, I know, but please. We want to encourage our children to think, not to tune inand tune out.",1093219200,2,483,4.9753086419753085
