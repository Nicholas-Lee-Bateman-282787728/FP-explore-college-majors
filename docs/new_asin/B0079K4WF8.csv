When you get a good look at them or when they allow you to get a good look at them - holy crap.  It's like eating authentic Chinese food for the first time and thinking there is no way that a foreigner, a Silk Roader, could have missed this about these Celestial Imperialists.

The food is sophisticated, clever and original and unlike anything else (I haven't had knockout Indian food yet but I imagine it's spectacular) - but Chinese food in its original form would have been an advisement and a warning - now long forgotten or no longer widely acknowledged:  this is a very supple intellect not to be trifled with or crossed.

PRESUMING ONE ATTENDS international film festivals as cherished opportunities to catch things outside the main-stream & otherwise not-necessarily-available (and NOT just to ""pick up chicks""), one could come across, as I did at the year-before-last's P.I.F.F.

""Life Without Principle,"" as a title, is a posit more than an accusation: what happens -- what ENSUES -- when ""lines drawn"" have become erased, variable, subject to manipulation by others, on the basis of little more than whim?

Like none-too-few post-modernity works (Stacey Levine's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dra/dp/1891241311/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dra-</a>&nbsp;comes to mind) a lot of the concern becomes that of a new architecture: not stable or unstable by design but by happenstance, by mergers of wills and coincidence, the end result necessitating a details-in-flux rendering to avoid being, simply, Dishonest.

Tellingly, it isn't until the Third episode that we get to the Triad (Chinese mafia) segment; already, we've seen how these thinly-sliced decisions play out in two other (not-unrelated -- how ""unrelated"" can markets from one another BE?) venues, necessitating Life-threatening (if ""Life"" starts with ""Livelihood"" concerns) before we descend to the dregs of the black-market economies one would usually associate with the Visceral.

In retrospect, much of the ""busyness"" of To's concoction doesn't just have to do with his exemplary skill as a director/scenarist -- it would, one'd have to think, have to do with his alertness and attunedness to What It Means when the world's most populous country (more a ""Civilization-State"" than a ""Nation-State,"" as Martin Jacques has pointed out), ends up processing the accelerated-possibility mainframe that are swinging like booms through the Structures everyone's been relying on to Get By, all along ... the result is Individual Choices, and the method of dealing with it is Open-Eyed Immersion.

I've paid only scant & passing attention to the accomplishment of this film as a cinematic experience: shockingly, the minutiae-of-life stuff feels as cliff-hanging, as heart-wringing and breath-taking, as the more ""macho"" stuff in the third episode (helping also lend that sequence a bit more pathos, a bit more attention paid to the minutiae that fuels, irretrievably, THAT life, too!

8512892,4,B0079K4WF8,"Life Without Principle looks like a crime film, plays like a morality tale, and unfolds during one of the most significant events in recent world history. It should come as something of a relief that it is not a violent potboiler, a moralistic sermon, or a political social study. In the hands of  respected auteur Johnny To, it is so much more and a completely entertaining jot in filmmaking. Out now on DVD from Vivendi Entertainment after playing a few US film festivals, but failing to receive even a limited North American theatrical release, hopefully this movie will find an enthusiastic audience waiting, it should easily appeal to a large number of viewers with many different interests and open minds.

Set, as it is. with the recent global economical finical meltdown as a back drop. The plot has three different storylines converging as three desperate people's paths cross on the frantic day of the  collapse of the Greek government. Taking place in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong, police inspector Cheung (Richie Ren) is investigating the murder of a loan shark, while dealing with a number of personal crises of his own. His wife, Connie (Myolie Wu) is desperate to buy a condo out of their price range, his father is terminally ill, and has left him custody of a young sister, that he never knew existed and who's mother has run off.

 A low level, but loyal to a fault triad member named Panther (Lau Ching Wan) tries in vain to get his incarcerated boss, Wah (Siu-Fai Cheung) bailed out of jail, when he comes to the aid of another friend, Lung (Philip Keung) who has made some very dangerous back room deals with triad money.

 Last is Teresa (Denise Ho), a bank employee being pressured to meet her quota of new investors and finally pushed to the point of  near deception to snare potential investors before a twist of fate makes her future even more uncertain.

The story isn't a preachy one, even though we deal with gamblers, crooks, thieves, swindlers, and other morally ambiguous characters. We get inside their motives, some are greedy, some are honest, some are steadfast, all of them are victims of circumstance, some will win and some will lose.  We get a more full understanding of what happens when average people must abandoned their principles too survive.

In the last decade or so producer-director Johnny To, unfairly dismissed at times as being the HK ""Jerry Bruckheimer"", has developed a strong following with his mostly superb crime thrillers. Titles like the Cannes film festival Palme d'or nominated Vengeance (2009)  and Election (2006), with their mixing of elements from American film noir, French new wave, and Hong Kong heroic bloodshed movies. Life Without Principle is somewhat of a departure, it's more in the ambitious style of a Wong Kar Wai film, but many of his themes and stylistic techniques are visable.  Also, real hardcore devotes of To's should be aware of his penchant for slipping into other genres at will, including comedies, superhero flicks and dramas, Chow Yun Fat even won a HK Oscar for To's child custody tear jerker All About Ah-long.

Appropriately apathetic camera work and astute editing from Sie-Keung Cheng and David M. Richardson, respectively, two frequent collaborators of To's. They keep the film flowing at a breakneck speed, even when the events sometimes seem rambling or disjointed. These fluid filmmaking techniques also help the movie to over come it's sometimes stodgy opening moments to arrive at a satisfying slow burn of a conclusion.

Life Without Principle is a prime example of the fine film work that is still coming out of Asia, that all too often goes ignored in the western world.  Filed with relevant situations and a full understanding of our current global financial situation, not to mention strong amiable characters, even if they are lowlifes. This is the kind of good quality filmmaking that I think a lot of movie goers crave, but can't always find, maybe that's because some of these fine films are being relegated to the backs of the continuously vanishing video store.

8512893,4,B0079K4WF8,"On the surface ""Life without Principle"" (""Dyut meng gam"") looks like yet another Hong Kong crime drama, but the 2011 Johnnie To film, while dealing with a familiar subject, also allows us to look deeper into the greed-driven modern society we live in, seen through three characters all in a desperate situation.

Teresa (Denise Ho) is a banker selling financial products, who needs to turn her business results around quickly. Panther (Lau Ching Wan) is a fiercely loyal gangster who must raise the money to bail out his sworn brother. Inspector Cheung (Richie Ren) is a hardworking police officer whose wife Connie (Wu Myolie) wants to purchase an expensive apartment room as investment. The three persons and those close to them are severely tested when a global economic shock hits the Hong Kong financial market.

""Life without Principle"" is exactly about what the title says. Crimes may be committed (in a violent way), but the film's focus is on ethics and integrity of the people left in an unbearably uncomfortable position. Among the three stories loosely connected together, Panther's is the most impressive, with Lau Ching Wan's memorable performance that makes his character most credible and sympathetic among the three.

Director Johnnie To has been associated with gangster movies ever since directing his intense ""The Mission,"" but the prolific director in fact has made other types of films including comedies and romances. ""Life without Principle"" shows that the veteran Hong Kong director has an interest that extends far beyond the noir genre, and is able to make a film that is entertaining and insightful.",1362182400,,1627,5.15530303030303
8512894,4,B0079K4WF8,"A bank officer, a cop, and a criminal are all in need of money during the global financial crisis; how far will they go in order to get it? The story is deeper than that, but I'd rather not spoil the twists and turns this plot has in store.

I usually associate Johnnie To with amazing shootouts and action sequences with gangster storylines, but this film leans towards drama more than towards action. It starts off slow, but it eventually picks up the pace as it tells the story of the criminal. All of the stories are connected, by the way, and it's done well. It effectively shows what people would do, and what people would abandon (their principles), for money. I really enjoyed the ending, as well. The acting was great, and the music was amazing, although it really has one standout tracks that plays at the beginning/end and during the transition from story to story, I believe.

Overall, Life without Principle is a thoroughly entertaining drama, although it does have a slow pace. As of 11/19/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre or director.

Life Without Principle has some strong blood and violence. No sex or nudity.",1353196800,,1200,4.704761904761905
8512895,5,B0079K4WF8,"Film titles are often obscure, exaggerations or misleading but this one is spot on.
If you can be patient with the slow developing and seemingly not going anywhere opening scenes as well as some disjointed flashbacks where the film presents and interweaves different characters, then you're in for a Southern Chinese burlesque style lampooning of the pettiness and greed of Triad gangsters; petty wannabes and financial/banking capitalists. Poignantly, as we listen to each group, it becomes increasingly difficult to tell them apart. Well acted and scripted caricatures of gangsters greedily haggling over small monetary gifts; bankers and financial advisors manipulating and profiting off of the ignorance of vulnerable clients. All within the backdrop of one of many recent market collapses.

The financial, banking and market dialogue was so surprisingly intelligent that I thought I was listening to CNBC analysts selectively rationalize how greed is good, and how expendable people are for the sake of more money.

English subtitling (perhaps a remnant of the British education system) was of better quality than what's found in US English courses. This film continues the excellent script, directing, location and set quality coming from studios as geographically diverse as in Argentina, France and Hong Kong.",1344384000,2,1317,5.54726368159204
8512896,4,B0079K4WF8,"The movie starts out interesting as a look into Chinese investment banking industry. Brokers are pressured to sell investments. They are pushing BRIC, a portfolio of 20 stocks that invests in firms in Brazil, India, and China...something I personally wouldn't mind owning. It is ""high risk."" The bank charges 2%. People on low fixed incomes are allowed to invest their life savings in the deal. Teresa (Denise Ho) is one such broker who is torn between ripping people off and doing her job.

Yuen (Hoi-Pang Lo) hates the banking system and keeps his money in liquid savings. When the EU economy crashes, its ripple effect hits Chinese investors. Yuen is now rich as he has money to loan at 30% interest rates. Given a window of opportunity, Teresa manages to obtain a bag of money belonging to Yuen, a man who seems to disgust her. The film's idea of humor is to make puns of BRIC and brick. And:

Who ordered noodles before the banquet?
The fat guy over there.

Later it does engage in more sophisticated humor, even a bit of mild irony.

I was more fascinated when they made an arrest. They said something similar to the Miranda rights and offered the criminal a hood to wear to shield himself from the public, unlike in the US where the cops parade criminals around the police station doing ""the walk of shame."" Inspector Cheung (Richie Ren) is a straight laced detective/ police officer. His wife Connie (Myolie Wu) wants to lease an apartment out of their price range.

The crime syndicate is a brotherhood, so everyone is confusingly called ""brother"" or ""sister"" or ""older sister"" or ""Fourth brother."" It is difficult to tell who is blood related and who is not, possibly a translation issue. The gangsters, banking, gambling, and investment industries are all related in this film. There is also a plethora of US name brand products in the background.

The film shifts from the banking industry plot to the crime subplot. I initially thought they were chronological, but as it was they were concurrent and it takes you up to the point when they both come together. We then run the cop subplot through. At this point the film picks up.

The story was mildly interesting, but what was more interesting was watching the Chinese operating Hong Kong like real capitalists. Most of the signs were still in English. I am giving the film 4 stars mostly due to the modern cultural insight into China and the promise it shows in Chinese film production. It was refreshing to see a Chinese film where the actors don't spend a lot of time fighting horizontally in the air, defying gravity.

8512898,4,B0079K4WF8,"Although this Johnnie To movie seems to start off a little slow it soon entertwines the stories of three different people, in very different jobs, who are all in need of money for various reasons. This takes place during the global economic downturn of 2009 in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong. It's an interesting story of greed and the lengths people will go to and the principles and morals they will cast aside to attain money. The first main player is Teresa (Denise Ho) a bank loan officer who is not making her quota of customer sales. She pressures customers into investments that are risky at best with no seeming qualms about what this could do to these people's lives if everything crashes. The second player is Inspector Cheung played by Richie Ren, who's wife is trying to buy a luxurious condo in Hong Kong that is really above their means while her inspector husband is busy off trying to solve the murder of a loan shark. The third main player is a gangster named Panther played by Ching-Wan Lau who is anxious to help bail out his mob boss.  The interconnections between the three players and others in the movie seems to be a metaphor for the global interconnections of the current financial markets. The movie involves stock trading, corruption, loan sharking, theft and sometimes just plain luck. It's an interesting tale with good acting and good cinematography. It's not your usual Johnnie To shoot 'em up movie but there is violence in it. I give it 4 stars and recommend it if you like stories of financial dealings and don't mind films that are weaved together out of 3 plots to create one movie.",1338595200,,1622,4.651567944250871
