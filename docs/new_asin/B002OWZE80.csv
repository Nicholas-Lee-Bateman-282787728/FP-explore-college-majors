3963549,5,B002OWZE80,"Oh My God...I LOVE THIS!!!!

I loved David E. Talbert's plays before but now he's taking it to another level. I saw this play live in Los Angeles at the Kodak theatre and have been waiting to get the dvd ever since!  I've loved Morris ever since Boyz In The Hood, but I have to say this is my new favorite from him. He looked so good in the play. So did everyone. This play had me laughing and screaming at the television the whole time. It was like I was on a roller coaster of emotions. It was definitely worth the wait and something I will be watching over and over and over again!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-E-Talbert-Presents-Love-In-The-Nick-Of-Tyme/dp/B002OWZE80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David E.

3963550,5,B002OWZE80,He's done it again! David Talbert is truly a gifted writer.  The quality and clarity of the dvd makes you forget it's a play. I felt the story line touched on several different aspects of every day life. I could relate to many of the characters and I believe that anyone watching this will be pleasantly surprised.  Great Work David. Keep up the good work.  Morris Chestnut and Avant were pleasing additions.  Both did well.,1259971200,,424,4.613333333333333
3963551,5,B002OWZE80,"I am a fan of all David E Talbert's work. I have all his plays that are out on dvd. I went to see Love in the Nick of Tyme live on stage in New York. I loved it. I was excited to hear that it was coming out on dvd. I still get thrilled seeing it again. Morris Chestnut as always did a wonderful job. He is an outstanding actor. Ellia English, Avant, Andre Pitre, Blu Mitchell and Terry Dexter were all great. My first time hearing Terry Dexter was on a song she performed with Jaheim called Remarkable. She has a wonderful voice. Andre Pitre is just so fine. Blu Mitchell was hilarious as Elgin. Vivian Green showed her true talent as a song writer. David E. Talbert, you have done it again. I can't wait for your next project. The show was all around amazing.",1259971200,,760,4.141891891891892
3963552,5,B002OWZE80,"It is an honor to write a review on this play.  Initially I just wanted to support a David E. Talbert project.  The more I heard about it the more excited I got about it.  Well, it arrived and I popped it in right in the middle of spelling review with my son (I just don't do that!) When I say I couldn't stop watching it, I mean it!  It was very entertaining, uplifting, funny, interesting and most of all R-E-A-L..

Ladies you'll want to go out and order something from UPS in hopes of getting THAT delevery man! Ya gotta get it to know exactly what I mean.  You won't be sorry.  It is well worth the investment. Men, the leading lady will make you pay close attention and be on TYME...everytime.  Ya gotta get it to know exactly what I mean.

Wonderful job David, Lyn and each and every person that had anything to do with this project. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

3963553,5,B002OWZE80,"I bought this dvd for my girl, cause she's probably Morris Chesnut's #1 fan. After hearing her scream at almost every line, I came
in the room and started watching it with her. I've seen a couple plays on DVD before but this on tops them all. At first
I couldn't really tell it was a play because of how good it looks on my 52inch screen. It really looks like a movie and a play mixed together.
Most folks are gonna just think it's for the ladies, but fellas... I have to admit, I enjoyed it just as much as my girl did.",1257638400,16,520,4.009615384615385
3963554,5,B002OWZE80,"I was watching Mo'Nique and she hyped this play so had to see it for myself!  I am not of color but must say I thoroughly enjoyed this play with the twists and turns it took.  Davis Talbert did a fantastic job and had fabulous actors!  I hope he does more plays as I look forward to seeing more rich comedy!

Great play!  Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed!",1272844800,,359,4.071428571428571
3963555,3,B002OWZE80,IT STARTED OFF SLOW. IT GOT A LOT BETTER TOWARD THE END. I LOVED THE END.,1271030400,,73,3.625
3963556,3,B002OWZE80,I really though that this play was going to be the best but after watching it twice once by myself it is alright but i really didn't like the role that Morris chestnut played it's just not him he reminds me of Denzel washington in Training day didn't like his role in the movie either,1269043200,,284,4.181818181818182
3963557,5,B002OWZE80,This play is awesome and uplifting and funny! There is hope yet for real love in the nick of TYME!,1268784000,,98,3.95
3963558,5,B002OWZE80,"I thoroughly enjoyed my selection.  The events that occurred in the movie were true to life.  I enjoyed the manner in which the events all played out to bring the final conclusion.

Certainly was ""food for thought"".",1268438400,,215,4.756756756756757
3963559,5,B002OWZE80,"I loved the DVD.  It made me realize that I can still find love. You don't have to accept just anyone or anything, You have God on your side and he makes things possible. Just be patient and things will happen.",1268438400,,210,4.121951219512195
3963560,5,B002OWZE80,I am a huge fan of David E. Talbert's stage plays and I must say that this one is the best I have seen yet.  Each one gets better and better.  The music is and AWESOME!!  Vivian Green is an AMAZING artist and he couldn't have chosen better to write lyrics.  There aren't enough words to describe how great the cast performed each song and their characters!  Since I saw the plays on BET I have been collecting them.  David's plays are a MUST HAVE for your video collection.,1268006400,,473,4.258426966292135
3963561,5,B002OWZE80,I thoroughly enjoyed this play.  The actors were awesome and so was the singing.  Morris Chestnut was the cherry on top.,1267142400,,120,4.666666666666667
3963562,2,B002OWZE80,"I was not pleased at all with this play.  I have seen his plays in the past and this one was no comparison.  It was soo predictable and not enough singing. What was the point in having Avant in the play if you wasn't really going to let him sing? As for Morris Chestnut, that was a waist of a fine black man because he really didn't have that much of a role,which was predictable everytime he was to show,and he was the main man. It was boring to the point I kept pausing it just to make it through. I could not believe this was a David E Talbert play. I'm just very,very,very disappointed. I was expecting soo much more. Maybe next time because I will continue to support my brotha. I just pray he gives me better material to work with.",1265673600,,737,4.146853146853147
3963563,5,B002OWZE80,"Although I saw this play in person, I think they could a better job filming this stage play for the DVD version. Loved the concept of the play.  Just do a better job with the color quality.  It was too dark.",1265587200,,207,4.024390243902439
3963564,5,B002OWZE80,"Great Play! I enjoy all of David E. Talbert's Plays, he sends messages in all of his Plays. The Play ""Love In The Nick Of Tyme"", starring Morris Chestnut was awesome.",1264550400,,166,4.387096774193548
3963565,5,B002OWZE80,"The play was excellent! The cast was great, n Morris did his thing with his fine self!",1261958400,,86,4.117647058823529
3963566,1,B002OWZE80,This play appears to be directed more for the mainstream crowd versus christians.  Mr. Talberts other plays has more of a christian message than Love In The Nick of Tyme.,1261958400,,170,4.666666666666667
3963567,5,B002OWZE80,"My wife and I watched this play, and we both enjoyed it very much it was very entertaining.",1260835200,,91,4.111111111111111
3963568,4,B002OWZE80,"Interesting, just not quite what I thought it was, good play, I would recommend to others.",1260835200,2,90,4.6875
3963569,2,B002OWZE80,"I was full of anticipation when ordering the film off Amazon when I heard Morris on the local radio station in Washington DC.  Morris is my boy so I was so geared up for this stage play just to find out that the story line is so weak and the leading lady need more acting lessons.  The only funny part was the crack head part taken from Dave Chappelle show. I must admit it did pick up a little at the end, only at the end.",1260835200,,423,3.9069767441860463
3963570,3,B002OWZE80,Good though but how many people will review the movie anmd think about their actions?,1260835200,,85,4.733333333333333
3963571,5,B002OWZE80,This play was off the chain!!I buy a lot of play and this is far one of the best plays i have seen in a long time!!!You have to add this to your collection.,1260835200,,156,3.6176470588235294
3963572,5,B002OWZE80,This is a excellent play and it really shows how love does win in the end.,1260230400,,74,3.6875
3963573,5,B002OWZE80,"I usually don't check for plays on DVD but I have seen a few of Mr Talbert's.  Fabric of a Man is a favorite I watch over and over.  But I got this one to see Terry Dexter.  I'm a fan of her music and she posted the release of the play on facebook.  This play is a joy to see and especially to hear.  Vivian Green did an amazing job with the music.  I knew Ms Dexter could sAng and it was very pleasant to see her acting was on point.  She and Amdre Pitre gave life and vitality to those songs and the storyline (why my UPS driver don't bring me love?).  All the actors and singers were good.  Especially good to see Ellia English and hear her voice plus she put some real sass in her character.  All in all you will not go wrong and will probably do like me and watch it over and over again.  Oh yea, Morris DID look good + he's a fine actor! David E Talbert, next ""Tyme"" I will check for your play on DVD!",1260230400,,907,3.848648648648649

8376515,5,B002OWZE80,"The female lead was a bit awkward, I thought, but other than that, the play was written well and professionally acted out and not overdone. You won't be disappointed. It's not preachy but yet, even the unbeliever will grasp its message.",1402444800,,236,4.780487804878049

Story well acted out.  Singing and music very well performed.

Always enjoy works by David E. Talbert and this was no exception.

Look forward to purchasing the next project.",1284681600,,265,5.238095238095238
8376519,4,B002OWZE80,"Initially I just wanted to see this play because it has my husband in my mind Morris chestnut in it but besides that boy was i in for a surprise. I couldn't stop watching it, very entertaining and kept my interest in more than just Morris.

Wonderful job David!",1275264000,,261,4.326530612244898
8376520,4,B002OWZE80,I truly enjoyed this play.  I feel that Morris Chestnut played a characted that he usually doesn't play and it was a refreshing change.  I'd like to see more plays from him.,1273795200,,173,4.375
8376521,3,B002OWZE80,I thought Morris would have a much bigger role.  Only wanted to see the play because of him.  I felt disappointed when the play was over.,1272931200,,137,4.230769230769231
