8277474,5,B001AHPB56,I teach the play The Crucible and his is a great little intro to the Salem Witch Trials and the theories about the causes. It gives the class a great discussion starter.,1483315200,,169,4.3125
8277475,1,B001AHPB56,"This was so boring and lame. they do a bunch of scientific experiements to figure out why it happened. I could care less, I wanted a docu about the witch trials, and found myself watching a bunch of science geeks perfroming tests, and worst a hypnotist at the end trying to induce mass hysteria. So stupid.",1470528000,,306,4.482142857142857
8277476,3,B001AHPB56,"Unsolved History: The Salem Witch Trials is a dynamically edited documentary that could also serve as a rockumentary of Ozzy Osbournes early MTV days. Witches! Evil symbolism! Overacting! The face-melting edits shift the viewer around the screen violently, even when a scientist is simply baking bread.
 The rockin documentary begins with a laundry list of possible causes for the Salem witch trials, including political motivations, profit motives, hysteria (possibly induced by foul rye, thus the scientific bread-baking)  or more likely some dread combination of these factors.
 In order to solve history, the folks at Discovery Channel begin by presenting it: Tituba was the slave who inspired Reverend Samuel Parriss daughter Elizabeth and her cousin Abigail Williams to believe that they were under the witchs spell. Soon the town exploded into madness, and after it ended, twenty-four accused witches were dead.
 Within the dynamic structure of the energetic documentary, scientific experimentation is conducted. When one drops a dummy off of a forklift from the neck and no one is around to hear it but some shabbily-dressed scientists, what does it have to do with the Salem witch trials? Not much really, because the accused witches were hung from the neck and not dropped off of galleys, or indeed forklifts, which seems obvious from the x-rays. No, these poor souls were strangled to death by rope, as the rather gruesome images remind us over and over again until we either get the point or a sandwich.
 The ergot fungus grows on rye, and a lonely scientist has commandeered Walter Whites meth lab (likely due to the notorious lack of contaminants) in order to determine this: Did over-exuberant rye munching lead to the hysteria that overtook the young girls? The ergot fungus is known to cause visions and such, but it should die when heated during baking. Yet, there is only one way to be surebake bread on TV! The viewer flies around the reimagined drug lab watching chemicals drip through tubes and is presented with intercut footage of actresses writhing on the floor with demons in their eyes. Its all very compelling, and it turns out that: yes! Ultraviolet circles have proven that some of the ergot fungus has survived baking! Has history indeed been solved? Probably not, since everyone in Salem likely ate a similar amount of rye, as did anyone in New England or the world who had access to rye (a lot of people). Also, the amount of ergot required to spike the needle past batshit also causes gangrene, the effects of which are presented several times in the form of blackened fingertips on a stock-photo hand. Because no gangrenous girl reports surfaced from the annals of the Salem witch trials, we can imagine that this probably wasn't the cause of the shenanigans.
 History, in this case, has probably already been solved as well as its going to be. Still, within the often ridiculously over-the-top construct of the documentary is an amount of somewhat useful scientific information. We get a sense of the suffering of the innocents. We also get the idea that at least some of they hysteria may have been due to chemical factors, and the well-known names and facts are also presented in the documentary. More weight!",1427500800,,3247,4.992606284658041
8277477,4,B001AHPB56,"I always have found the Unsolved History series well-made, informative and entertaining. The Salem Witch Trials is very good in content, quality and entertainment. However, there is one (personal) theory that I wish they had addressed, but didn't. I don't want to speak too much about the program's theories, as it may be a ""spoiler"" for potential viewers, but here's my own theory, all/one points of which may have happened, or a combination of the following:

1.  The minister's daughters were known to have dabbled in black magic with the slave, Tituba, and got caught. I think they simply decided to shine the light of guilt on someone else, i.e., the ""witches"". Witchcraft was a very serious offense, punishable by death. Perhaps, being small children, they thought it would end there, and not mushroom into a territory-wide witch hunt. Of course, then they'd be forced to keep up the fiction. Other girls later joined the ""fun"" to get attention, for amusement, etc.

2.  The resulting witch hunt and trials were entertainment, sort of Puritan reality TV. In an era and culture that had no TV, reality or otherwise, and very limited acceptable public entertainment, this would've provided many months of drama and excitement for the populace of Salem and the surrounding areas.

3.  Hacked off at that neighbor who keeps letting Bossy the Cow wander into YOUR yard?  Had an argument with that woman down the street?  Suspect that merchant cheated you? Hmmm....sweet revenge. It only took a mere pointing of your finger to see your enemy accused of witchcraft and even perhaps elimintated forever.

All that said, I highly recommend The Salem Witch Trials. Even though I believe that my therory is something to be considered, the program is well thought out and informative, and the best I've ever seen on the subject.  I've watched my copy several times since buying it a month ago, and still enjoy the documentary.",1351987200,,1920,4.953271028037383
