5852244,1,B00DS79H10,"Really poor movie, very bad acting and a plot that failed to even give me a single scare. No meat to that plot. Seriously, save yourself time and money by not watching this.",1385942400,2,173,4.2727272727272725

5852246,1,B00DS79H10,"Amish Amy (Jessica DiGiovanni) has returned from Rumspringa and becomes a devout member of the community. Her brother Daniel (Clayton Myers) has chosen not to return and is now shunned. Amy is being courted by Robert (Kurt Mason Peterson) who does not believe she has the power to see evil souls. This is an odd Lancaster, Pa. community, one where women pluck their eyebrows and only older members of the community have Pa. Dutch accents. Amy can see evil souls and is sought out by outsider Chris (Christopher Atkins) to help her clean her community of evil with a combination of lemons, dolls, and chanting.

The few special effects are low budget CG, something you might expect from a bad 90's film. The plot lacked depth and the actors lacked the ability to deliver convincing lines. If you can make it through the entire film it is worth one punch of your ""hacker card.""

5852248,1,B00DS79H10,"Terrible! Such a terrible film. This is the first time I'd be reviewing about a movie. I felt I am inclined to share my thoughts because you will be wasting your time watching this film. This movie was acted terribly, the script was horrific, visual effects were just horrendous, and the music is cheesy.

I had high hopes for this film as I was checking out the IMDB reviews, it had a couple of reviews, not much, and both seem to be on the same page on how great of a horror movie this is. I don't know what they were thinking, really, but I was disappointed. To sum it up, this film is a sort of movie that was made by high school students straight from a high school project.

It had a good premise, but just the delivery overall was bad.",1380844800,3,742,4.181818181818182
5852249,4,B00DS79H10,Amy is a psychological horror film. It's about Demonic possession in an Amish community. Lots of suspense. I was on the edge of my seat. Great movie to watch during the Halloween season.,1380758400,,186,4.666666666666667
5852250,1,B00DS79H10,"The concept is intriguing, a string of inexplicable occurrences plague an Amish village. Amy, a pious young woman, is haunted by visions of possessed children. At first, no one believes her. She's actually denigrated by those around her for it, until death and madness wreck havoc on the once peaceful community. It's not entirely original, but the novelty of its setting piqued my interest. Unfortunately, the movie's just not very good.

One would never believe the man behind this film was a professional, a veteran of over 60 movies. R.P. Patnaik wrote, directed, and scored ""Amy"" and all three aspects are excruciatingly lackluster. Though the overall concept is interesting, the execution suffers from what one would assume is inexperience, but Patnaik's resume claims otherwise. Considering his credentials, one must then question his actual abilities.

The writing is bad, bad, bad. Leaps of internal logic give the impressions of a disjointed plot, much of which doesn't make much sense anyway. The happenings are never given an origin. Is this Amish or aboriginal folklore? Is it New Age hokum with a Christian bent? As the creator is from India, does it have roots there? It's never explained, so we just don't know. I'm not sure what the sperm-like phantoms floating around the village are because we're never told, but the effects are cartoonish and rather amusing.

The directing/editing isn't smooth, giving the movie a student film vibe. There are occasionally some beautifully framed shots, but that's the extent of the skill level here. Along with the bad writing, the poor directing/editing makes the movie feel uncomfortably choppy. The acting is strictly community theatre level. It ranges from respectable to painfully appalling. Jessica DiGiovanni and Kurt Mason Peterson do the very best they can with the material, but they are surrounded by amateurs who drag them down. Christopher Atkins, the only star of this charade, is so somber and monotone that his performance borders on caricature and I found myself laughing more than once. At least he took the project seriously, but it sure won't bring him any further offers.

The music is terrible. It's overwrought, formulaic, and inadequately cued adding to the rough student film vibe, it only succeeds in further alienating the audience. As Patnaik has supposedly composed the score for 60 films, this should have been the highlight of the movie. As it is, it's just another disappointing facet of a genuinely bad experience.

I love indie cinema, especially no-budget Do-It-Yourself movies made for the fun of it, so I'm quite forgiving of amateurish charm, but with a claimed multi-million dollar budget and a 60-plus film resume for the writer/director/composer, the basement level production mistakes of this movie are simply unforgivable. In fact, I've seen many DIY backyard epics that were much better than this. The untimely, schizophrenic and homophobic twist at the end certainly didn't earn any brownie points either. As I wish I had my 90 minutes back, I can't say that I recommend this movie to anyone.",1380758400,5,3092,5.176

5852268,2,B00DS79H10,"This movie made little sense. The dialog had people talking to each other like they hadn't heard what was just said. Weird s*** would happen and nobody would address it. Like - did you not just see that? You have nothing to say about it? Then Atkins' character comes in and gets in the action wth absolutely no reason for him to be there. We're just supposed to be like ""ok sure, makes sense."" But it didn't. Thing is, I wanted to like this movie! It had everything, but it was just executed so poorly.",1457481600,,502,4.294736842105263
5852269,1,B00DS79H10,"Cool DVD artwork, terrible c-horror movie. No scares, lame acting.

It all starts with the opening scene: ""Amish"" girl has nose ring scar. (Amish are forbidden to wear nose rings). When you open a video that can;t even get the basics right, you know you're in for a really lousy ride.

CON: Annnd it goes downhill from there.

5852271,4,B00DS79H10,It's hard nowadays to come up with some originality but I was able to watch and although I kinda figured out the killer until I was confirmed I was lead to believe it was someone else. Just the way it was wrapped up seemed typical. If they didn't through in the typical mish mash for the ending this would of been an awesome movie. But it was worth my time.,1396137600,,357,4.114285714285714
8597017,1,B00DS79H10,"I think this movie might just have the worst opening credits of all time. Highly annoying. Be prepared to hit that skip forward button A LOT. Actually, on second thought, you should probably just avoid this film all together.",1497484800,,225,4.794871794871795
8597018,1,B00DS79H10,"No idea what's going on here. This is a 1 star movie, others got that because I couldn't give a 1/4 star, so its at the top of the trash heap - for what that's worth. Lots of hanging out laundry and comments like ""Mr Miller just made a buggy for his new horse"" which sounds a bit like Mr Miller is overly fond of that horse, I would have liked to know more about this interesting Amish tale... the horse and buggy romance would have been far better than whatever was going on in the plot. I don't know if was confusing, ill thought out or just so deathly boring I lost my way... I suspect all three. As for the high star ratings, one admits it was because their grandfather was in it. Well, sorry, but the rest of us just aren't that interested in your grandfather-though I hope no one else knows he was in this debacle. You can skip this and never have to worry you missed anything... you wouldn't have made sense of it anyway.",1488240000,2,928,4.161111111111111
