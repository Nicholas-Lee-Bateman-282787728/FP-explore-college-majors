683072,3,6303560326,"What could be more exciting than watching, on a small screen, ice and snow coming at you at over a 100 mph.  That's the basis of this film; but, more importantly, it shows the courage, ingenuity, and the will to survive by the people who visit Ski Resorts for fun and recreation.  Heat up your drink, sit back, and relax and book your next vacation at a ski resort.",1238976000,,365,4.27536231884058
683073,1,6303560326,You need to watch this movie expecting it to be a spoof on disaster movies to get the jokes. Rescue team waiting to catch  the kid hanging on the ski lift wire are not standing under him - when he falls they all watch him hit the ice off to the left. But first they make the kid wait until a camera man is set up to get it on film!! All the special effects scenes during the avalanche are hilarious. Watch how a chunk of snow coming in the resaurant window eventually causes the chef to put a huge pot of boiling hot soup on his head! This movie is a riot!!,1097712000,2,557,3.9292035398230087
683074,4,6303560326,"Yes, this movie was made by Roger Corman, but I think that this is actually one of his better films! The plot is very interesting, and VERY 1970's, but it is still a relevant plot for today's audiences.  Plus this film has that '70's camp feeling (although I hate camp! But oh well...)

The film is about a ski lodge owner (played by Rock Hudson) who invites his ex-wife (Mia Farrow) to the grand opening of the lodge in the Colorado Rockies.  Hudson really wants to get back together with Farrow, but she has a thing going with a nature guy (Robert Forster) who is a ranger or something; he does plant the bombs to start 'controlled avalanches' I know that much.

Anyway, a lot of famous skiiers and ice skaters also show up, one of them, a pro skiier with his new wife, who is traveling with her sister, a pro ice skater, and the wife's ex-husband, a famous news reporter also shows up, so there's a kinda pointless love triangle going on.  Then, at dinner, Hudson's hilarious drunken mother (a sweet little old lady by day) starts thinking she's in Hawaii and then The famous Skiier and Ice Skater get drunk and go have sex in the guy's cabin.  His wife then enters, and runs out into the snow, half naked, screaming her head off.

The next day the wife shows up in the cabin and threatens her husband, but he throws a glass of milk at her, tells her that if she's going to kill anyone, it should be herself, and then kicks her out of the cabin.  Then Hudson, who wants to get back with his wife, but who always becomes bright-eyed at the sight of his secretary, gets a glass of OJ in his hot-tub from his nude secretary.  He then demands that some guy fly out to the lodge today to bring him some important papers.  Meanwhile, Farrow and Forster have spent the night together in his cabin in the middle of nowhere; Forster has gone to trigger another controlled avalanche.  Hudson is then judging an ice-skating competition, and the famous skiier has gone up the mountain to ski.  Then the plane with the guy with the papers gets caught in fog or something and crashes atop the mountain, exploding, and setting off some of the worst, grainy, avalanche atock footage i've ever seen!  Then the snow (which up close is a whole bunch of styrophome chunks) traps a lot of people, kills many, and destroys half of the lodge.  Then there is the whole aftermath of trying to save the people who are trapped, which goes pretty fast.  Then another protagonist, who had just been rescued from being burried alive, gets put into an ambulance which skids off the road, falls into a gorge and explodes, pretty brutal.  Then we get to the ending which is really, odd...well you'll just have to watch the movie.

So, overall, ""Avalanche"" is actually a fairly well done B movie from 1979, i actually enjoined the soap opera-like love triangle and and the suspense of ""who will survive?"" So, although the effects are dated, the dialogue pretty dry and sappy, and the plot full of holes, the movie is actually pretty good!",1093996800,22,3007,4.488073394495413
683075,5,6303560326,"The title says the tale.  It is a forgone conclusion that ice and snow will fall, but the plots and subplots are intriguing.  Albeit the special effects aged, but the cast is superb, I really enjoyed this film.",1068768000,10,210,4.5

683141,3,6303560326,"One of those B-movies that really are funny - if you don't expect too much. Anyway; many films with a far higher budget (see ""Meteor"") deliver much less. But: the best feature of the Blu-ray is the short interview with Roger Corman in the extra section: almost a lecture on filmmaking with a shoestring budget.",1424736000,,310,4.654545454545454

683143,4,6303560326,"Roger corman who's more famous for making low budget
Action thrillers & Horror films during the 70's
makes an attempt to Produce his one and only Disaster Genre film called AVALANCHE
the plot is basically about a Mountain landslide full of snow that crashes and destroys a Holiday resort
Produced by Roger corman, Directed by Corey allen

the DVD release had no extras of course
so Distributor Kino Lorber decided to add new special features to their blu-ray release of the film
a new recollection interview with Roger corman
a new recollection interview with Actor Robert Forster
and the Trailer has been given a new HD transfer aswell
a new HD remaster has been given to the 1:85:1 widescreen picture
so the the picture quality does look much better than the previous dvd release that's for sure
the story line is alright written, but not excellent

so time to upgrade to blu-ray for this film mainly cause of the 2 new interviews as extras
so i gave this blu-ray 4 stars at least worth some money",1416009600,8,999,4.670454545454546
683144,4,6303560326,"Rock Hudson. Not as his best, but I really enjoyed it. The leading lady was a bit underdone. But than I never liked her as an actress. They story line was pretty good. Not boring. I will watch again. The picture quality could have been better.",1412035200,,243,4.304347826086956
683145,4,6303560326,"This is producer Roger Corman's low budget take on the big-budget disaster films of the 70's. While it takes nearly an hour for the actual avalanche to take place and the special effects cannot be considered top notch, the cast of old pros do their best to entertain you and they do. It is nice to finally see this film in its original aspect ratio after seeing it in a theater in the mid-70's. Scorpion Releasing does another fine job of presenting the film in the best possible manner, even though the extras are light (just an original trailer and on-screen interviews with Corman and co-star Robert Forster). Still, it's a nice film for me for nostalgia reasons and it is always great to see these B-Films get a great presentation. Scorpion Releasing is proving to be the go-to company for obtaining little-seen genre films in great condition on both DVD & Blu-Ray. When Scorpion joined forced with Kino Lorber, it gave Scorpion a whole new range of films to release. That is good for all us genre addicts.",1411862400,2,1010,4.648044692737431
683187,2,6303560326,"Not even close to what I remembered. Even by 1978 standards this is awful. bad editing, bad acting, bad dialog, bad effects, bad sound and bad soundtrack. Don't even start me on the horrible dance sequence, why? Let's take Rock Hudson...did he need the money? All he did was yell, shout and scream. Who decided that Mia Farrow was beautiful? Jeanette Nolan is the plucky, loud obnoxious old lady. I always take these 70's disaster movies with a grain of salt and my tongue firmly in cheek but I remembered this a better, boy, was I wrong...the worst of all of them. You care about no one,  all terrible people and actors. Silly sub-plots. Just embarrassing all over the place. At about 83 minutes into it there is a ridiculous crash that just made me laugh when it shouldn't have. Really....skip this, it isn't even a good bad movie.",1411430400,,833,4.590604026845638

683192,5,6303560326,"Thanks to producer Roger Corman, this one made its Region 1 debut outside of Canada for disaster collectors everywhere.  Although not one of the better Rock Hudson or disaster films, Avalanche had some cool special effects that were used in other avalanche-themed disaster films through the Eighties and Nineties.  Still a chestnut in anyone's collection.",1369872000,2,355,5.4363636363636365
683193,5,6303560326,Rock Hudson stars in this little gem. In the 1970's disaster films were moneymakers and everyone in Hollywood probably did at least one. A B film but entertaining. Lots of action and soap opera.,1361923200,,194,4.735294117647059
683194,4,6303560326,"Was looking for the original version, well I found it!  My fiance and I watched this one together.  We both enjoyed it.  This is the one he kept mentioning to me, but I thought we already had it.  Very Good.  Rock Hudson!!!!",1361750400,,224,4.238095238095238
683195,2,6303560326,"The camera work was immediately off-putting and not a little distracting.  There were an overabundance of medium and close-up shots that made everything seem tight and confining.  Couple that with poor lighting (half the time one actor or another was unlit....in the same shot!), and the result is the sense that no one knew what they were doing, including the editor who sharply cut every sequence so abruptly it felt like they were pressed for time.  This was especially odd since they took all the time in the world to eventually get to the point, the avalanche.  If you like your Styrofoam on the chunky side this movie is for you.
As for the actors: poor Rock Hudson came across as frantic, Mia Farrow seemed more capricious than usual, they should have let Rick Moses sing, and Jeanette Nolan did what she was best known for....BIG performances.  Only Robert Forester came across as genuine, which made him seem out of place from the rest of the hams.
Best scene, trying to calm a hysterical woman with a glass of milk.
Otherwise, this only serves as a primer on how NOT to make a disaster movie.",1313539200,7,1102,4.630769230769231
683196,4,6303560326,"I enjoyed this movie. It showed what happens when arrogance takes over. I know a couple bosses who is like that. It's their way or no way.
