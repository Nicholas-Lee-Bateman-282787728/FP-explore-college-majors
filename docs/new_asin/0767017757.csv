7793233,5,0767017757,"This 5O minute tape is the 1st tape in a volume of four 5O minute tapes all on the rat pack. Volume 1 shows the beginnings of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and Peter Lawford BEFORE they became the Rat Pack. It also includes info on ""Skinny"" D'Amato (the italian who gave Frankie his 1st break in 1939 and Dean Martin his in 1946, & who also helped mold Sinatra's behavior and became his life long friend) Other people included on this tape are Humphrey ""Bogie"" Bogart (it shows how he had an important influence on the rat pack) & Jerry Lewis, Dean's sidekick before he started to hang w/ Frank and the boys. EXCELLENT footage is include like Sinatra performing in the EARLY years, Sammy as a little boy tap dancing, Dean Martin doing stand up w/ Jerry, etc. and GREAT still shots of the guys too!  Although there wasn't much on Joey Bishop, it is still a MUST for rat pack fans!!",987638400,12,895,4.391566265060241
