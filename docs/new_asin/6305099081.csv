963252,4,6305099081,"Well they are back. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon in another film together that shows how great they work together and what great comes from  it as a result. And sadly, Odd Couple 2 is the last film for this dynamic  duo due to Matthau's death in July of 2000. This film picks up 30 years  after the original. Felix is living in NYC and Oscar in Florida, the two  haven't seen eachother in 17 years. But they are brought back together when  Oscar's(Matthau)son is getting married to Felix's(Lemmon)daughter. They  meet up at the L.A. airport to take a road trip up to where they live. Many  mishaps during their trip cause for a delay of gettting their and lots of  comedic fun. This film isn't the duos best, but it certainly is very good. I  have never seen the 1st one and if you want to see this, u don't have to see  the original. All you have to know is that Oscar Madison is a slob and  Felix Unger is a neat and paranoid. And of course that they used to live  together. If you are a fan of either one of these stars of them both as a  duo, this is a must see. Its sad that this is their last film together. If  you liked this and/or want to see anyother of their films together i would  defintly reccomend Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men, and Out To Sea. Rated PG-13  for language.",967939200,8,1286,4.166666666666667
963253,5,6305099081,"If there's a sequel that lives up to the original movie, this is it! Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon star in the incredibly funny reunion of  Oscar Madison and Felix Ungar, Odd Couple 2. Having performed in the stage  play for which the original movie was based, I was a little sceptacle  whether or not Neil Simon could write another screen play that could live  up to the hilarity of the first. After viewing this movie my fears were put  to rest. It was just as funny as the first ( if not funnier). Lemmon and  Matthau deliver a perfect performance that stayed with in the continuity of  the characters that they portrayed thirty years ago. A real laughfest!",967593600,4,661,4.504201680672269
963254,5,6305099081,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau team up again in this teriffic comedy as the infamous Odd Couple. After being  away from each other for seventeen years, Oscar Madison (Matthau) and Felix Unger (Lemmon)meet again,this time  to travel to the wedding of Oscar's son and Felix's daughter. On the way  they encounter tons of crazy characters and situations,after losing Felix's  expensive suitcase-along with their map-and forgetting the name of the town  they are driving to! This hilarious road trip is a great display of the  famous team of Lemmon and Matthau",962496000,21,556,5.122222222222222
963255,4,6305099081,"God bless Lemmon and Matthau!. They're getting older, but they are still the greatest. There was a lot of risks re-teaming Felix and Oscar after thirty years and after the first Odd couple, but the final result is a  funny road movie: and when the two clowns meet at the airport, and Felix  runs to Oscar, well, all of us would run with him. Thanks to Amazon I had  the chance to see it in Italy (where the picture wasn't distribuited in the  theatres).",928108800,3,453,4.357142857142857
963256,5,6305099081,"I don't know why the critics thought this movie was not up to par. I thought it was great. Maybe the critics based this movie soley on the plot, as it was just about the misadventures of these two great comedy actors on  their way to a family wedding. But this movie was sooooooooooo funny!

In ""The Odd Couple II"" Oscar and Felix are reunited for a wedding after 17 years of silence.  Unfortunately for them, everything goes wrong during their trip.  While trying to get to their kids' wedding, they get arrested three times, attempt to hit on two younger women, and take a ride from an old man who dies a short way into the trip!

I have read all the complaints of juvenile humor and inappropriate dialogue, but in my opinion, this is still a funny movie, and a beautiful tale of friendship between two clashing personalities.

964698,5,6305099081,this movie is hilarous. jack lemmon and walter matthou are so funny together.  the movie is great.  the product is by far a 5 out of 5 movie.,1163030400,8,141,4.0
964699,4,6305099081,"hm. where to begin. i'll start with the gripes. this movie came out 19 years after the original , which was probably 15 years too late. both actors are obviously aged, simon has lemmon drop two f - bombs, which i've always found sad when  an actor has aged and everyone thinks its funny if he/she can 'shock' us.

anything else ? no , not really.

Now let's see what i found to enjoy about this film, and that would be every wonderful scene. its true that everyone has aged and its no longer 1969, but simon's script is wonderful and funny as hell, and matthau and lemmon still maintain the great comic timing that made them household names. The story is slight, the visits to the sheriff perhaps a bit overdone, but there is a lot to reccommend this comedy. For one thing, I watched it tonight with several other people and we LAUGHED. Matthau especially was born for broad comic delivery and very New York accents and dead-on delivery. His throwaways are better than most screen lines nowadays!

And of course there is a bit of wistfulness about watching these two comic greats work together for the last time (three if you count Simon, and we have to count Simon - he's writing lines funnier than ever, even if he does lean on the lamentable f- bomb  a few times. ) I got this film super cheap and it sits right next to its funnier predecessor; maybe not a precise complement, but a terrific way to spend a rainy evening with a big bowl of popcorn.",1152230400,3,1451,4.399253731343284
964700,5,6305099081,"There are some people that get along perfectly.  It is almost as if they are made for each other.  Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) and Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon) are definitely not some of those people.

 The Odd Couple 2, directed by Howard Deutch, is a comedy based on Neil Simon's hilarious play about two ex-roommates (Madison and Ungar) brought together after seventeen years for the marriage of their children.  Madison is the ""pig"", and Ungar is the ""human vacuum cleaner"", and together they are absolutely priceless.  After meeting at the airport to begin their road trip, the pair faces continuous obstacles on their way to the wedding before finally arriving.

 As the disorganized Oscar Madison, Walter Matthau delivers an utterly brilliant performance.  His portrayal of Madison is flawless from beginning to end.  Quite the flirt, Madison tries to convince some women that he is ""not as old as [he] looks.""  According to him, he had ""this plastic surgery done recently, and the quack doctor botched it up.""  This is only one of his many desperate attempts for his ""candle to glow one last time,"" that Matthau has down to a tee.  A total and complete slob, Madison does not hesitate to drop his trash from his apartment window and leave the cats to clean up the mess.  It is this carelessness that Matthau exemplifies so brilliantly.

 Jack Lemmon is absolutely terrific as Felix Ungar, an extremely organized man that lives for cleanliness and order.  There is no doubt that Lemmon was the man for the job, with his many quirks and idiosyncrasies.  Ungar has a laminated suitcase as well as scheduled times to eat, sleep, and use the restroom. His need to have food every four hours is a result of his ""low sugar condition.""  With his ""unusually small windpipe"" and allergies, he must constantly clear his sinuses with a ""FNAH!"" that remains extremely funny throughout the entire movie.  Lemmon manages to turn every strange mannerism and peculiarity into side-splitting fun for all that are watching.

 Not only do both actors do fantastic jobs, but also their chemistry onscreen makes the movie that much better.  Their personalities ""mix like oil and frozen yogurt,"" and it is this clash that provides such great comedy.  Madison sums up his feelings about Ungar, declaring that his ""hair got whiter, [his] ears got bigger, [his] nose got longer, but [he] still retains that unique, elusive pain in the ass quality that drives [him] berserk.""  No matter how much they get on each other's nerves, their care for each other remains clear.  Having been friends for many years, Matthau and Lemmon's relationship off-screen is reflected in their acting.  There is no doubt that there is something special about this dynamic duo.

 The Odd Couple 2 is an unforgettable comical knockout that has us laughing from start to finish.  It is clear that both Madison and Ungar have met their match, and we all can only hope that someday we too will find that one special person to challenge us forever.",1133395200,5,3003,4.889108910891089
964840,3,6305099081,"The LA Time Theatre Critic once said about one of Neil Simon's lesser plays ""A bad Neil Simon play is better than most other's best work.""  When you add into this mix Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, a terrible SLM film is better than most other's best!  And this is not a terrible film.  Lemmon and Matthau would be simply funny reading a telephone book.  A telephone book written by Neil Simon read by Lemmon and Matthau would be hysterical.

Jack and Walter slip back into their most famous alter egos, Oscar and Felix, thirty years later.  Oscar has been exiled to Sarasota, Florida.  Felix is still in New York.  They are reunited when Oscar's son and Felix's daughter decide to get married in California.

They meet up at the airport and start a 200 mile road trip to the wedding.  The sight gags are silly but for some reason Lemmon and Matthau actually make them funny.  The best scene are the simple one on one scenes with Jack and Walter.

Christine Baranski (""Cybil"") and Jean Smart (""Designing Women"") make a hilarious appearance as Thelma and Louise wanna be's.

If you love Jack and Walter or Neil Simon, this is a must have DVD.  If not, then pass.

964841,2,6305099081,"What a disappointment. Watching Matthau and Lemmon struggle so hard to make this clanker enjoyable was nothing less than depressing. Part of the enjoyment of the first Odd Couple was the clash of personalities between Felix's anal retentive, obsessive/compulsion and Oscar's boorish impatience. This film hardly touches upon that struggle and, instead, becomes a watered-down version of one of the Grumpy Old Men movies. In fact, this movie seems like a compilation of other Neil Simon movies. When Felix and Oscar get lost in the Californian desert, it's ""The Out of Towners"", except in reverse. When Oscar's son gets cold feet on his wedding day and camps out on the roof, it's like ""Plaza Suite.""

Also the use of the F-word and of middle fingers just makes the movie seem all that much more desperate for laughs. Lastly, the Florida/California milieu is just inappropriate for these two neurotic but iconic New Yorkers.",1120521600,18,923,5.072368421052632
964842,3,6305099081,"Any doubts you might have about the wisdom of reprising these classic characters are erased in nanoseconds once you hear Neil Simon's ballistic one-liners zinging from Oscar Madison's surly countenance.  Although we haven't seen Oscar and Felix for 30-odd years, they clash like it was yesterday. Ageism taketh a mighty blow as you've never heard such fresh and funny geezer jokes.

Granted the film drags in the middle, and Simon wanders from his generally credible plotlines to the ridiculous (must be that move to Hollywood). But the opportunity to see Felix clear his sinuses in public again makes such venialities utterly forgivable.  It's the same scene from the first Odd Couple, but you'll heartily welcome an encore because it's too funny to be wasted on one movie.

It's regrettable that Walter Matthau, one of the all-time great comic actors, was never cast as W.C. Fields during his film career; imagine what he could have done with that role. But I thank the stars he hooked up with Simon and Lemmon.",1116547200,,1013,4.9411764705882355

just as moving too

see this movie

Lemmon and Mathieu ravish just as much as Felix and Oscar as they did in the first Odd Couple movie

see this

you'll laugh and be moved too at times

with the whole story

worth the laughs every time I play this in my dvd player

it will be a hit with young and old folks 90 years from now",1109289600,4,364,3.76

You also really don't get the flavor of messy-man verses neat-noid-man, but just the fact they are stuck with one another again and they keep getting in these absolutely ridiculous situations is just to good to pass up.

964846,5,6305099081,"Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, two comedy greats, pair up again in this hilarious film.  In The Odd Couple II, it has been 17 years since Oscar and Felix last saw each other.  They are reunited to go to their children's wedding.  Along the way they get arrested three times, encounter two lovely ladies Thelma and Holly, and get on each other's nerves no end.  After making such a hit as Odd Couple, making a sequel was risky business, but Walter and Jack pulled it off!  Sadly it would be their last film together.",1087084800,35,516,4.446808510638298
964847,3,6305099081,"Most ""number twos"" in movies are a lame echo of the original,and this picture is no exception. What is most noticeable in the two protagonists is the passage of time. Some scenes were still funny, but a sad melancholy pervades the film, which has very little to share whit the brilliance of the original odd couple. Not so bad as the ""Grumpy old men"" movies, but some of their sour flavour is felt there.",1026604800,4,404,4.472972972972973
964848,3,6305099081,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are back reprising the roles they played on Broadway and on film, those of Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, respectively. Lemmon and Matthau work brilliantly together and after several years of starring in ""grumpy old men"" comedies, this was to be their last pairing together.

It's been over twenty-five years since THE ODD COUPLE and seventeen years since Felix and Oscar last spoke to each other. Felix is still in New York and Oscar is in Florida. However, the two are reunited in Los Angeles to drive together to a very special wedding: Bruce Madison (Oscar's son) to Hannah Unger (Felix's daughter). Along the way, the duo falls into all sorts of misadventures and can never seem to leave a particular small California town.

However, this wasn't quite The Odd Couple. The wit and drama that made the original so fun and entertaining to watch just isn't in this sequel. It's as though as Oscar and Felix aged, their humor staled as well. The premise of the film was so promising, but there are lots of things that just don't work. For instance, Oscar and Felix were best friends, 17 years is a long time to never communicate with one's closest and dearest friend. Still, the film does star Lemmon and Matthau and their comic chemistry is brilliant. The movie is worth watching just for that.",1015804800,,1326,4.735930735930736
964849,1,6305099081,The original Odd Couple is one of my 10 favorite movies of all time so I was excited to see what Oscar and Felix were up to now. After viewing this tragedy I had to go back and watch the original again just to get the taste of the sequel out of my mind. There is far too much bathroom humor in this movie and it has none of the subtlety and wit of the first movie. This may be Lemmon and Matthau but it definitely is NOT Felix and Oscar.,994118400,5,437,3.8131868131868134
