4529709,4,B0052CKBBO,"Why rating?
I was surprised that I enjoyed this movie because I expected it to be a classic movie, which usually means a three star if it is decent.  I gave it four stars because the acting was good and I enjoyed it quite nicely.
Like or Dislike?
The acting was good.  It wasn't cheesy like I expected it to be.
Who recommend?
Nice romance with a patriotic flair, so for the patriotic romantic anglofiles amerifiles.",1398816000,3,416,4.4605263157894735
4529710,5,B0052CKBBO,"Loved the storyline, music, dancing!  James Cagney delivered a humorous yet touching performance.  West Point is really portrayed well with it's rules and discipline.  Despite this rigidity the caring attitude of cadets shines through.",1390867200,2,235,5.852941176470588
4529711,5,B0052CKBBO,"I really loved this film. All the main characters are favorites of mine, especially Louis Hayward. Overall the acting was excellent & I thought the story unfolded in an interesting way, thanks to the acting. I would recommend this film for anyone to see who enjoys seeing a good movie, even if they did not kknow who any of the actors were.",1389657600,6,340,4.5
4529712,5,B0052CKBBO,"I first saw this movie in 1949-50 when it seemed to be the only movie shown on TV,  each night just before sign off. My in-laws, with whom my husband and I lived had a console TV with a screen that may have been only 7"" and certainly was no more than 9"". Roller Derby was the only other show I saw at that time. I searched for this movie for years, never finding it when I collected or taped VHS, and never saw it broadcast by AMC, TCM or any other channels. I would have taped it even with commercials, if necessary. Let me know when the movie, THE TRAP, becomes available.",1356998400,,574,4.079646017699115
4529713,5,B0052CKBBO,"Loads of fun. The three leads, Louis Hayward, Richard Carlson and Tom Brown are like old friends. Joan Fontaine lovely and charming. Shot, at least in part, on location at West Point. Several scenes at The Thayer Hotel. I've stayed there. This is the real deal. The print quality good enough. If you like these people, you will certainly like this film.",1315612800,,353,4.709677419354839
4529714,5,B0052CKBBO,"I saw this movie on television in New York about 1950. About twelve years after its release. To a ten year old boy it was fun, exciting and got me gung ho about West Point and its traditions. Yes, it was another Hollywood version of life at the academy. This movie was never intended as a documentary. I saw the movie again years later. At that point I enjoyed the actors. Louis Hayward who I had the pleasure of meeting(about 1975) was a really nice guy. He certainly never entertained thoughts that this movie would win critical acclaim. The movie did however provide grounds to hone his skills as an actor...which he became quite accomplished at. Two years later he was a very capable actor/star playing the dual role in The Man in The Iron Mask, followed by THe Son of Monte Cristo. Both were swashbuckler roles. He was a rather modest gentleman, and a decorated marine during WWII. I met Don Barry on location in Del Rio, Tx in 1968 for the movie Bandolero. He had a bit part in the movie...his better days behind him. We talked at great length because I was very familiar with many of the movies he had made. He was surprised that someone would know so much of his career. (As a movie buff, it was natural for me to know). For Richard Carlsen, this was also another early role to hone his skills. All in all, this movie was entertaining.......it is a movie I will watch again if given the opportunity.  -pepe38",1306627200,3,1416,4.446153846153846

4529716,5,B0052CKBBO,"This movie surprised Me!  I clicked on it because I love Joan Fontaine.  This movie was well acted, the story was well done but not 'over done'.  Great values are displayed prominently in the film.  I am quite sure that I will buy this one to add to my collection.",1445731200,2,264,4.22

4529718,4,B0052CKBBO,"I really enjoyed this movie.
The picture quality was above average.
There were several Academy pictures during this era covering West Point
and Annapolis. Usually involving tradition and Football.
I've loved them all so far.",1436745600,,224,5.428571428571429

8453774,3,B0052CKBBO,A combination of pre-war propaganda for the Army and boy meets girl and the coor of candets. Some interesting charaters from central casting and a hint of life behine the walls at the trade school.

8453781,5,B0052CKBBO,"The arrogant Cambridge student in the description is an American schooled in England because his U.S. Army colonel father is assigned to the U.S. embassy in London.  I don't think that arrogant is really the right description for Louis Hayward's character.  I would describe him as irrepressible and self assured with a self depreciating sense of humor.  What ever he is, he is likeable and entertaining.  Joan Fontaine is fine as his romantic interest.  There is a strong supporting cast and nice black and white cinematography.  The movie opened to mixed reviews in 1938, but the studio was happy enough with Hayward's performance that he was signed to a contract.  Leonard Maltin gave this movie two and a half stars out of four.  I streamed the movie with Amazon Prime so can not address any dvd's.",1454630400,3,802,4.845588235294118
