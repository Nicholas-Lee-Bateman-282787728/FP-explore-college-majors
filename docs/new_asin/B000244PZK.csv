Much of the Russell profile consists of footage of the venerable Dan Morganstern, jazz critic and director of Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies, discussing Pee Wee's music and his painting. Morganstern is always insightful. However, the DVD focuses more on Pee Wee's painting, which Russell started in 1965, than his jazz contributions, which date from the mid-1920's.

The few portions of archival footage featuring Pee Wee's playing are truncated; very cool, but very short. This profile of Russell deserves about ***1/2, because better musical footage is readily available elsewhere. (You can find several longer and utterly fascinating clips of Pee Wee on Youtube.) The DVD's segments with Pee Wee talking are not clearly recorded and would have benefited from having subtitles available.

The segment profiling Baby Laurence is skillfully edited. The profile explains the art and impact of Laurance's wonderful tap dancing, and it is simply better produced than the segment on Pee Wee. Much of the footage is Baby Laurence himself explaining his steps. When a third party adds commentary, the points are lucid, relevant and brief. That said, some of the footage with dancing is quite dark, making it difficult to follow body movements. This profile is 28 minutes long, and the time seems to rush by.

Bottom line: ****1/2 based largely on the strength of the segment on jazz hoofer Baby Laurence. Note that only one side (NTSC format) is designed for USA players. If your DVD will not play, flip it over.",1314662400,4,1570,5.101167315175097
