8753310,5,B01CJU66J2,"I really like this DVD. It is very varied, both in speed and in the landscapes. As the title suggests, they take you through forests or dunes, which is very relaxing, which is supported by the slower speed. Another cycling route is very fast and it takes you up the mountains. This video is my favorite because you can pedal really fast here. Due to the variety of this DVD, exercising on the exercise bike is fun again.",1463097600,3,420,4.397435897435898
8753311,5,B01CJU66J2,"Relaxing as well as a great addition to my regular workout on my stationary cycle.  It makes my workout go faster.  There are three cycle rides to choose from that feature different scenes of forests, sandy roadways and mountainous terrain complete with the sound of birds and ocean waves.  No shaking camera, stunning full color professionally filmed footage.  I really enjoy this video.  It is one of my favorites because of the variety of scenery it offers.",1460332800,,460,4.922077922077922
