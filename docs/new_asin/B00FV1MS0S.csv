6031594,5,B00FV1MS0S,"Great price, and the quality is good too...i was amazed because i have already shielded two guitars and a bass with this roll and i have plenty left for at least two more?",1390521600,,171,4.212121212121212
6031595,5,B00FV1MS0S,"enough to do a couple or three guitars, seems to be good quality. My partscaster is ultra quiet (and I'm no great shakes at soldering)",1441324800,,134,4.4
6031596,5,B00FV1MS0S,"I used this to shield the body cavities on a Mexican FSR Stratocaster. Fender did use conductive paint in the cavities but for some reason I feel better with the copper foil. I did not use this foil for the pickguard since for that I have a pre-cut copper foil shield from Monte Allums.
The adhesive side is very sticky and the foil is thin. This made it difficult to cover the cavity sides with one long piece. I used shorter pieces of foil and it became manageable. Took a little over an hour to complete the job.",1438128000,,515,4.26530612244898

6031617,5,B00FV1MS0S,"I used this to shield my Fender Stratocaster guitar, it worked out great. I personally used it with ""WD Copper Shielding Foil 8"" X 12""  ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFDPVW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 ) to ensure I had enough to cover the pickguard as well.",1415750400,,266,5.82051282051282

6031634,5,B00FV1MS0S,"I have a late 80's Vandenberg that, and back when I bought the thing I didn't know the ins and outs of single coil pickups.  The Vandy actually did have good shielding around the electronics cavity, but now with the magic knowledge of the internet, I now know I could add shielding in the pickup cavity.

This tape is exactly what I expected... copper tape with conductive adhesive.  I used multiple strips in the pickup cavity, no folding over, and we had successful continuity all the way through to the ground.

Of course, that doesn't take care of every piece of buzz or hum you hear, but it takes care of a lot.  Be sure to turn off the fluorescent lights, monitors, and other bits of interference, too.",1391385600,6,708,4.5
