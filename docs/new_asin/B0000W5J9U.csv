8004054,5,B0000W5J9U,"In this incredible two-part episode, the turtles are caught completely off their guard by their most powerful enemy, the Shredder.  I guess the guy doesn't take getting a water tower knocked on top of him very lightly, huh?  This is why I love the new series so much.  We see the turtles fighting for their lives in this incarnation.  And they don't always win the day either, as seen in part two.

  The only reason I enjoyed Tales of Leo was because of the story line dealing with Shredder and Baxter.  This poor mad scientist has taken enough from Saki, and he's finally putting a plan in motion to get revenge.  Its also interesting that Shredder doesn't suspect the turtles of surviving the attack.  Great set up for the next few episodes!",1145145600,2,744,4.568181818181818
8004055,5,B0000W5J9U,"Although this DVD did NOT have any special features different from the ones on previous DVDs, it has what I think are some of the best episodes released so far. The alternative ending for ""Kirby"" was more of an ending than the TV version, if that makes any sense. Although the 2-part ""Shredder Strikes Back"" episodes are somewhat violent, and at times even morbid (esp. pt 1), the excellent humor makes the fighting and tension less tedious, while not distracting us from the main plot. And just when things are looking really grim for our heroes, another ray of hope for them is another cheer from the crowd. (i.e. Casey ""crashes the party""). And I've noticed--perhaps it's only a coincidence--that when the episode is particularly crucial to the story arc, the animation is better than usual. Watch ""The Shredder Strikes Back: pts. 1+2"", and you'll see what i mean; there is much more detail, fluid movement, and creativity in the action sequences, making the episodes more captivating and fun to watch. The one exception on this disk, animation-wise, is ""Tales of Leo"". Because the 2 preceding episodes were so carefully animated, the difference in this episode almost turned me off when i saw the quality. It wasn't bad; in fact, it was quite normal. But it's like on a CD, when there are a lot of GREAT songs, but the ""finale"" song is only ""okay"". But I did like how ""Tales of Leo"" went into some of the turtles' past, while showing what was happening between Stockman and Shredder.
All in all, I found this DVD highly enjoyable, and, except for ""Notes From the Underground"", the most entertaining yet.",1077580800,5,1607,4.763440860215054
8004056,4,B0000W5J9U,"This DVD is pretty great and has a few of the best episodes the show has offered thus far.
And incase for those wondering, yes, it includes the full ending to ""The King"" :)",1074902400,3,172,4.088235294117647
