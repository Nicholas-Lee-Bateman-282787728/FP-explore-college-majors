1407709,3,B000059PPA,"Fraught with over obvious symbolism, Hartley's early feature is nonetheless a joy to watch. Hal here shows us his uncanny ability to cast his characters perfectly came early in his career.
Adrienne Shelley is a near perfect foil to herself, equal parts annoying teen burgeoning in her sexuality (though using sex for several years); obsessed with doom and inspired by idealism gone wrong she is deceptively - and simultaneously - complex and simple.  Her Audrey inspires so many levels of symbolism it is almost embarrassingly rich (e.g., her modeling career beginning with photos of her foot - culminating her doing nude (but unseen) work; Manhattan move; Europe trip; her stealing, then sleeping with the mechanics wrench, etc.)
As Josh, Robert Burke gives an absolutely masterful performance.  A reformed prisoner/penitent he returns to his home town to face down past demons, accept his lot and begin a new life.  Dressed in black, and repeatedly mistaken for a priest, he corrects everyone (""I'm a mechanic""), yet the symbolism is rich:  he abstains from alcohol, he practices celibacy (is, in fact a virgin), and seemingly has taken on vows of poverty, and humility as well.  The humility seems hardest to swallow seeming, at times, almost false, a pretense.  Yet, as we learn more of Josh we see genuineness in his modesty, that his humility is indeed earnest and believable.  What seems ironic is the character is fairly forthright in his simplicity, yet so richly drawn it becomes the viewer who wants to make him out as more than what he actually is.  A fascinatingly written character, perfectly played.
The scene between Josh and Jane (a wonderful, young Edie Falco  . . . ""You need a woman not a girl"") is hilarious . . . real.  But Hartley can't leave it as such and his trick, having the actors repeat the dialogue over-and-over becomes frustratingly ""arty"" and annoying . . . until again it becomes hilarious.  What a terrific sense of bizarre reality this lends the film (like kids in a perpetual ""am not""/""are too"" argument).
Hartley's weaves all of a small neighborhood's idiosyncrasies into a tapestry of seeming stereotypes but which delves far beneath the surface, the catalyst being that everyone believes they know what the ""unbelievable truth"" of the title is, yet no two people can agree (including our hero) on what exactly that truth is.  A wonderful little movie with some big ideas.",1073260800,13,2412,4.972636815920398
1407710,5,B000059PPA,"As in The Book of Life, Hartley exaggerates the limitations he's given so that they seem like a style. And, they are. Burke isn't the block of wood he seemed to be the first time I saw this, and Adrian Shelley crawls under your skin and lays eggs that hatch days, weeks, and even months later. And the script? Hard to do it justice, but I will say that this is one for repeated viewings. Don't rent it, buy it! You won't be sorry.

1407782,5,B000059PPA,"Love the movie - but the quality is no ""blu-ray"".  It's more like a clean VHS Copy than a true hi-def blu-ray movie.

1407783,2,B000059PPA,"I got sucked in by the reviews, and having seen some other Hartley movies, I had high hopes. I don't know how many of the lines I winched at, but the cliches were flying fast, some of the worst dialogue written. So, maybe the acting was good considering what they had to work with.",1402358400,,281,4.222222222222222
1407784,5,B000059PPA,"This film was made in 1989. It was compared to Woody Allen's work at the time because it was quirky, funny, profound and filled with zingy one liners throughout. It was made by Hal Hartley who would continue to be compared to Allen if Allen weren't Jewish and his films could at times have happy endings. In 2014 you will have to search high and low to find a love story this good being made present day.

23 year old beauty Adrienne Shelly was Hartley's muse. She played a just graduated from high school girl en route to Harvard. Her love interest is a rumored murderer now working as a mechanic for her father. In typical quirky Hartley fashion no one seems to know who he murdered or why and his list of victims is entirely based on local gossip.

The relationship between the girl and her father is absolutely hilarious as well. They are at cross purposes throughout. When he tries to put a spoke in her wheels, she turns around and becomes an overnight success as a lingerie model, splashed all across the New York papers, which sends him into a tizzy. She is also convinced that the world is on the brink of a nuclear disaster and this hilariously peppers all her exchanges as well.

If you have never seen this film, you need to change that now!

1407785,5,B000059PPA,"This is a great first film! I would put it up there with Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have it"" and Jim Jarmusch's ""Stanger Than Paradise""
I am just kind of stunned how these guys got so good so fast! I love Hartley's dry style. Thank god someone out there is making films with a different feel for reality than typical filmmakers aim for. The plot is fun, and the acting is cool, AS Hal Hartley aged he got more sophisticated and definately made better sound tracks than this but I am not sure any other films of his are this fun to watch.",1393804800,,535,4.203883495145631

1407789,5,B000059PPA,"This is Hal Hartley's first film, shot on a shoestring budget, but with incredible success. If you are familiar with Hartley's films, they involve clever dialogue, circular conversations, and understated performances. Some may mistake this for poor acting or filmmaking; those people are missing the point. The Unbelievable Truth is a remarkable achievement for a first-time filmmaker, and launched him and Adrienne Shelly directly into making Trust, another picture that should be seen by anyone who enjoys challenging, independent cinema.",1366761600,,540,5.7625
1407790,5,B000059PPA,"This one is less underrated than just plain unknown. It was the first film for both Hal Hartley and Adrienne Shelly (described by the Onion's A/V Club as ""the thinking person's obscure object of desire""). Hartley went on to become one of the best independent filmmakers in America (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Fool/dp/B001ZMCDY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry Fool</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Such-Thing/dp/B001NV5LKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Such Thing</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trust/dp/B00A32H1E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trust</a>) and Shelly to become an indie-film queen both as an actress and later as writer and director (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waitress/dp/B0011Y4A5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waitress</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-ll-Take-You-There/dp/B001IHYZO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'll Take You There</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sudden-Manhattan/dp/B00005TRZB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sudden Manhattan</a>). As with all of Hartley's work it is quirky, funny, talky, and thoughtful; as always, Shelly is charming and perfect. The story is small and in places bizarre, but the characters are beautifully drawn: Josh, a mechanic who is more like a Shaolin monk, is released from prison and returns to his hometown.  No one there can seem to remember exactly what he did to get sent to prison in the first place, but it just MUST have been pretty bad.  Audry, a cynical high school senior wrestling with the meaninglessness of life, falls for him.  And, yeah, it's just that simple; it's less about story than about the interactions between the characters.  It's funny, but smart-funny, not goofball-funny. Well, okay, it's a little bit goofball-funny too, I suppose. This is a small, rough, sparkling diamond of a movie. If you haven't seen it, give it a shot.",1365811200,,2072,7.620833333333334
1407791,4,B000059PPA,"That nailed it. You have to don't you?. I just really get it when it comes to Hal Hartley. If you don't, you probably won't be reading this. This is not his best film. My vote goes, by a narrow margin, to Henry Fool. But, this is good. As usual it's well acted and has dialogue with that special Hartley realism. What is that? I sometimes think that really interesting creatives create the dialogue people should have but often can't because we are all too inhibited and self-possessed. Sometimes this is like the things you wish you had said and sometimes it just seem to have a truthful ambiguity. ""Hell, I don't always know what I mean so don't ask me!"" The story, as usual, is about a guy and a girl. This time a very young girl with a significantly older guy who has a history. It turns out it's a false history, constructed like most opinion from falsehoods and misunderstandings. Also, the desire to protect someone you love. Sometimes life does involve taking a bullet for someone else. The true meaning of love? Or is it just a death wish? I think by now you have either stopped reading or you have bought it.

1407820,4,B000059PPA,"Along with Simple Men and Surviving Desire, the Unbelievable Truth is one of Hartley's best films. Firmly entrenched in the 80s when it was made, this lightweight comic romance has a lead character of the wonderful Adrienne Shelley (RIP) as a young woman who negotiates college versus work deals with her parents while believing the world is going to end via nuclear disaster at any moment. Into this comes the hero, Robert Burke in his gorgeous youth, as a newly released prisoner coming back to his hometown. The script is brainy banter and just walks the fine line between stage and actual people, which is one of Hartley's best talents. The earlier films like this one (pre Amateur, for instance) still have a light touch with the dark edge instead of the dark edge with blacker humor like the later films: for fun, romantic, cynical college-educated Hal Hartley, watch this.",1360454400,,879,4.866666666666666
1407821,4,B000059PPA,"Don't know how he does it, but the way Hartley gets the actors deliver their lines and the timing of the pauses really makes his films get to the core of the emotion or issue at hand.

1407823,5,B000059PPA,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a movie that constantly makes you think about the journey we call life. The writing is the key.,1299283200,,150,3.870967741935484
1407824,3,B000059PPA,"I'm usually a pretty hard-line guy when it comes to movies. I'm the type who likes foreign films and classics and cerebral character dramas. The Unbelievable Truth is much lighter fare than that. Looking at this movie analytically, I can't exactly say it's such a great movie. But for whatever inexplicable reasons, I find it highly enjoyable.

This movie doesn't have the most exciting plot. Most of the plot events are actually pretty mundane everyday slice-of-life events of ordinary people's lives. But there is something about the texture of this movie that is appealing in a unique sort of way. I just like being in the space of this movie.

It takes place in one of those small towns in America where everyone has known everyone else for a long time. Yet it's not sweet or bucolic like the Andy Griffith Show. But people are connected in a believable way. I like the way the people in town just bump into other familiar people in the course of their everyday lives, and it's nothing surprising to them. There's just enough of a touch of eccentricity to make the movie fresh and unusual, yet it doesn't wear quirkiness on its sleeve the way so many of these independent films do.

One of the two main characters is a cute teenage girl obsessed with nuclear war. The other is an ex-convict recently returned to town, who is soft spoken and cerebral and whom everyone describes as ""like a priest or something."" The movie has an appealing musical score that I can't get out of my head. This isn't a laugh-out-loud sort of comedy, but it does have a humorous tone.

Yet beneath all this, there is a subtext of ideas for the cerebrally adventurous. It contemplates the nature of money. The practice of making deals, of bartering one good for another and what role that practice plays in life, is a recurring theme in the movie. Is life just a series of deals to gain assurances that certain things will be delivered? Or is there a point where one must accept that there is no certainty and have some faith?

No doubt, many who watch this movie will wonder where on earth I'm getting that. They'll watch it and see only a cute, quirky, inconsequential comedy. But for cerebral perceptive viewers, you'll find something here to chew on.

I always appreciate some info about sensitivity myself, so I'll give some here. Unfortunately, there is some excess profanity that for my taste was unnecessary and detracted from the film. Though there are a couple of mentions of sex, there are no sexual encounters at all in this movie. There is no violence.

I have to give this only 3 stars because much of it pretty lightweight stuff, and not the strongest story in the world. This is not monumental drama. But in terms of pure enjoyment, it's probably more like a 4 star movie for me. It's atypical for what I usually like.",1251676800,,2815,4.618

1407826,5,B000059PPA,"I was saddened to hear of the tragic and senseless passing of the beautiful actress Adrienne Shelly. Nobody can watch Hal Hartley's ""The Unbelievable Truth"" and not be struck by how talented and engaging Shelly comes across onscreen. At the time of the film's release it seemed as if she was a star in the making. However, she seemed more content to stick with modest indie films and sporadic appearances in acclaimed TV shows rather than become a fixture in vapid Hollywood product that would have increased her exposure. Eventually she moved behind the lens for what was shaping up to be a very interesting directorial career. Sadly, we will no longer be able to witness her growth as an artist, but as a small consolation we still have films like ""The Unbelievable Truth"" and ""Trust"" to remind us of her once luminous presence.",1163116800,15,830,4.770833333333333

He becomes smitten with his boss's kid; and she too, with him. But the fledgling relationship at times seems to be dead before it can take off. I guess one definitely learns patience in prison. Also nearly everyone gets into shoving matches. This was my second Hal Hartley film after seeing Simple Men on VHS many years ago, and although Simple Men will always be my favorite of Hartley's films, I might actually prefer the acting and dialogue here.

THE UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH: There's no doubt that Hal Hartley's films are an acquired taste, or that his sense of humor is more intellectual than visceral. His dry, stilted dialog is executed with an arch, deliberate delivery which gives everyone a certain quirk: an awkward detachment, making them sound more like people reading the written word than conversing. But this calculated constraint serves to accentuate the absurdity of our poor human attempts to grapple with deeply philosophical issues, like faith and trust: the dialog sounds like syllogisms of formal logic. And the ending of this particular Hartley entry is a philosophical spin on a French bedroom farce, with the principals all lurking around looking for ""truth"" instead of a tryst.

The result is a caustic, contemplative comedy about people trying to be rational rather than human--and usually losing the battle. Hartley specializes in ""dangerous comedies""; absurd situations which could turn tragic with a single wrong gesture. And his actors work wonders within these limits: Burke is a young Christopher Walken, and beautiful, baby-voiced Shelly, a gamin marionette. If Hartley's first morsel doesn't whet your appetite, don't quit before trying his main course, ""Trust.""",1422489600,,1501,5.198347107438017
