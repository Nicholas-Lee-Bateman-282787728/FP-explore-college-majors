It is a VERY funny movie that also has some very real emotional parts.  This is also so with ""Bride for Rent,"" a fantastic movie which I rate 5-stars+.  I picked up ""My Illegal Wife"" when I was in Manila -- and I am glad I bought it -- it is very funny with some real life and raw emotions thrown in between the lines.  I would recommend if you really want a laugh of a corny but wild plot that goes awry.",1529712000,,683,3.927536231884058
8672044,4,B00MG301X0,"A little corny but cute. I missed seeing this movie in the movie theatre here in Southern California, so when I saw this available on dvd, I thought I'd buy it.  Had I known how corny the movie was, I probably would not have bought it.  But, it did entertain me enough that I did not regret buying the dvd.  It's a keeper and something I'd watch when I want to view some mindless fun.",1472428800,,384,4.093333333333334
