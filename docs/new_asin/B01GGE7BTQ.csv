7759954,5,B01GGE7BTQ,Powerfully intense film with a refreshingly honest take on frontier life. Brutal and brilliant!,1468627200,,95,5.857142857142857
7759955,5,B01GGE7BTQ,"Fantastic film!  The actors are amazing.  Chad Michael Murray like you have never seen him.  Apple does not fall far from the tree with Francesca Eastwood Daughter of Frances Fisher ( Great Cameo) and Clint Eastwood.  She pulls you in from the moment you meet her. Teri Polo played a fantastic role of the religious mother holding on to Jesus but...................  Love love love the film.  A roller coaster of emotions and while on the edge, loved where it landed.  JT Mollner is a great Director and Writer. Ther entire cast worked thanks to JT's vision.  Great cast Luke Wilson, Ben Browder, Madisen Beaty, Keith Loneker, Duke Mollner and more.....  I am sure we will see more of his work, with out a doubt!",1468627200,3,712,4.67741935483871
7759956,5,B01GGE7BTQ,I'm familiar with JT's work from his short films. Once again he proves he can shock and awe. You'll see what I mean within the first two minutes of the film and the duration of the film.,1468627200,3,186,4.054054054054054
7759957,2,B01GGE7BTQ,"Do yourself a favor and watch something else. I'll give it 2 stars because of the acting and cinematography. The writing on this was just bad though. This was a perfect example of a movie where somebody tried to be ""shocking""  to overcome a bad plot all around. Many scenes were far too drawn out and not as dramatic as I think the writer was going for. I thought about stopping watching in the first few minutes because the pause on everyone leaving the bank was annoying, and the conversation between the 2 girls screamed that it was trying too hard to push boundaries. I don't mind graphic content, It wasn't that it shocked me, I just thought the movie all around was very poor. It was one of those movies where I kept thinking of aborting it midway, but felt I was too invested, and maybe it would get better. It didn't. Don't waste your time.",1514073600,,848,4.401273885350318

7759959,1,B01GGE7BTQ,"Where do I start?  This movie is one of the worst movies that I've seen in a while, glad it was free with my Prime subscription because I would have been furious if I paid for it.  I love westerns, but there is so much bad, I don't know where to start.  The plot is ok and the cast prob. did the best job they could with the dialogue and director. The director is all over the place, I don't understand, was he drunk?  Never realized how good directors make a difference.  The music, I've never complained about a music score or a director's skill.  But it was ridiculous, we would start laughing when the music cued in.  Who picked the music score?  Must be the director. And the dialogue, it made no sense at all.  I thought that the cast had a difficult time saying the lines without laughing.  It finally hit me at the end (yeah, I watched it all) the it was like a horrible Tarantino movie.  The director must be a huge fan and this was his version, it failed.  I love love Tarantino and this is  just plain bad and would never be mistaken for Tarantino.",1507680000,,1059,4.208955223880597

7759966,1,B01GGE7BTQ,Really disappointing from start to finish. Expected better given Broader and Wilson. Miss Eastwood has talent but this was a real waste of her talent. Sappy music throughout. Terrible dialogue. Poor direction. Sad lack of acting talent. Real waste of time.,1505433600,,256,5.2682926829268295
7759967,5,B01GGE7BTQ,"Finally a Western that tells a different story that is still believable.  Them pioneer girls had grit and had to be tough as nails.  I can't imagine why this movie doesn't have better ratings.  I thought it was awesome and completely unpredictable in the sense that there were so many possible ways the movie could go, but it was never obvious.  Events were lightly suggested but never obvious enough to give away the plot.  Great movie!",1505347200,,437,4.697368421052632

7759969,1,B01GGE7BTQ,"I own a lot of western movies. Often there wonderful morality tales. Clint Eastwood's daughter stars in this very dark and doubtful movie. Probably the movie never should have been made. Clint Eastwood has had some of the best westerns ever made. This movie though needed Input from someone to pull it out of the gutter! Others I know ejected the movie at the FIRST scene. I watched the entire movie, twice. Just when you think the movie could not be worse, it falls into greater disgusting bloodiness. Besides not being very well set in any form of authenticity or decency, not a a work of a even good writer. Makes Devils Rejects look great, which was a classic. This one just makes mankind look hopeless, if this is a new wave of western, the old classics will greatly outsell this trash!",1503187200,,791,4.577464788732394

7759974,4,B01GGE7BTQ,"I really did enjoy this movie. I respect when a director tries to show the damage a bullet can really do to the human body, This movie may be a little to much blood and gore for some. I think the movie may have been on point with the education level of a lot of people back then, and the way things were excepted especially out in some of the more remote areas then. I really enjoyed the twist and turns the movie took, just when you thought it was over or you knew the ending, Bam, anther twist. And I thought most of the new young actors/actress  did a really good job.",1499558400,,571,4.053097345132743

7759978,1,B01GGE7BTQ,"Ugh. This is probably the biggest stinker I've had the misfortune to view in the past year. By giving it 1 star, I am actually being forced to be far more generous than this film deserves. Horrible script, awful acting, WTF soundtrack that tries far too hard to be edgy and thought-provoking, but only succeeds at sounding silly and pretentious. This ragged little waste of celluloid can best be described as the bastard mutant spawn (but not in a cool, superhero sort of way) of an infernal cross-breeding between a particularly low-quality 60's spaghetti Western (yes, Clint Eastwood, I'm looking at you), and a D-grade, first-year film school project of some myopic Tarantino wannabe who simply doesn't yet comprehend the fine balance between clever, well-paced, expressive dialogue, coherent and cohesive plot lines, and relevant violence. Yes, believe it or not, on-screen violence should be relevant to the plotline in order to be justified, and not simply viewed as being gratuitous and out for cheap shock value. I did watch this till the end, because just at the moment I couldn't believe it could fail worse than it already had as barely passable entertainment, it would astound me by attaining some new, embarrassing pinnacle of bad form and tasteless - albeit laughable - storytelling and cinematography. This one will stick in my brain for a long time to come, and for all the wrong reasons.",1496880000,,1404,5.004273504273504

7759980,4,B01GGE7BTQ,"A gang of outlaws viciously rob a bank in Cuchillo, New Mexico and make off with the loot. Knowing they are being pursued they take a detour and go through an arid valley to throw off their pursuers.

They rock up at an isolated farmhouse and Chapel where they take captive the preacher, his wife and their two squabbling daughters. Over the course of the night secrets are unmasked and allegiances change in a constant ebb and flow of emotions and it seems that some scores just have to be settled.

Now this is a very good Western, it is realistic, well acted and does not pull any of its many punches. It starts off with the intention to shock and grab your attention and then keeps that up for the duration. There are a couple of points where you do question the on screen antics but to mention them runs the risk of being a plot spoiler. And in the final analysis they do not overly harm the full impact of this rather good and inventive film.",1494633600,,948,4.320224719101123
7759981,5,B01GGE7BTQ,"Get ready, this is a roller coaster of emotions.  Bank robbers fleeing from law enforcement and a bounty hunter find the home of a ""Christian family"".  Not the case.  The family is as dysfunctional as one can find.  Throughout their ""family"" ordeal, we find incest, sibling rivalry to a point of cruelty and a mother who turns her head to the obvious.

The main outlaw finds comfort and what seems to be love or caring for the youngest daughter, who tries at all expense to please her captures.  The twists and turns makes this a movie you can't help but find horrific but intoxicating.  Every time you think you know what's about to happen your shocked.

Even if excessive gore doesn't bother you, this film still suffers from poor acting, a bad script, cliched cinematography, nonsensical sound track, and a total lack of vision.

7760110,2,B01GGE7BTQ,"This is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.  If it were better written, it could have been interesting.  But, it ended up as a hodge-podge of pointless, sometimes really graphic scenes.  None of the characters are at all likeable.  In fact, the least despicable of the group seems to be the preacher who molested his daughters - which is saying a lot in itself.  I know that was kind of their point - to point out that there are no good guys, but the story was too choppy and the scenes did not  fulfill their purpose.  They would have been better off with scenes that actually told the story.  Cut the extended, graphic shock-value scenes and extend scenes that actually pushed the story forward.  You could have chopped most of the characters out of the movie and it wouldn't have made any difference to the story at all! The acting was stiff and uncomfortable; I think the actors realized this was going to be a really bad movie too...I'm not saying they were all bad, some of them put on good performances, but the moments of ""great acting"" were far outweighed by the moments of terrible acting or pointless scenes.  They didn't do enough character development.  People made decisions that were unexpected, but not in a way that makes sense because they didn't spend enough time on character development.  I actually watched the movie twice in the hope that I would find something good to say about it the second time through...Unfortunately, I am still really disappointed.  The best scene is still the ""almost rape"" of the preacher - it was funny and very disturbing at the same time!  Ben Browder provided the only interesting moment in the whole movie.  With a bit of work, this could have gone from a bad movie to a really great movie.  You can see what they were going for, and it really could have been great!  Unfortunately, they focused too much on the shock value and destroyed any potential the movie might have had.

7760138,5,B01GGE7BTQ,"This is a very strong and personal movie, and at the same time a major contribution to the post-modern contemporary western.
It plays on different layers, using the imagery and the elements of the classical western while developing a claustrophobic plot way closer to the first period of Roman Polanski, especially Knife in the Water, Repulsion and above all Cul-de-Sac. The use of 35mm film gives the image an overall texture of great beauty, in phase with the typical western locations.
The aim of the director, namely directing a western which, by some aspects, doesn't look like any of the previous westerns in Cinema History, is perfectly achieved. The path that he uses is fairly violent and unhealthy, and he has no problem leading us gradually to an increasingly darker place, the same as other fascinating directors/writers like Sam Peckinpah, Clive Barker, Dario Argento... or Roman Polanski. Still, in that somber universe, he manages saving room for genuine love.

Henry (Murray) and his gang of outlaws are on the run when the find a frontier house. They decide to hide out in there against the wishes of the family that lives in it. What starts off as a simple idea to hide soon expands into a dynamic that no one involved can explain or expect. There have been many many westerns that have come out in the last few years. Most of them awful, a few decent ones and then ones like this. One that isn't terrible and one that is worth seeing, but at the same time one that isn't all that memorable but it is watchable. The movie seemed to try way to hard to be like a toned down Hateful Eight but came off as more of a soap opera. There are some really good things in this and the twists are interesting and I do think it's worth seeing, but really only once. Overall, a movie that is entertaining as you watch it but a day or two after you won't remember half of it. I give this a C.",1469404800,,1011,3.9852216748768474
7760176,4,B01GGE7BTQ,"After a bank robbery which involved a few killings, Josiah (Luke Wilson) a bounty hunter is called in. The gang pulls up at a farmhouse with two daughters which has its own hidden demons.

The film includes dark humor, plenty of killing with blood splatter, and an inkling of ""A Dirty Western."" I hated to see Aunt Ester (Frances Fisher) die, (sorry for that plot spoiler, but then again you can count the survivors on one hand). At two hours the film dragged on as it spent too much time at the farmhouse, which they could have consolidated.

This is not your typical western, written, directed, and produced by JT Mollner who managed a good job at consolidating all that in one credit. Many facial close-ups of Francesca Eastwood. Film is a bit raw.

7760177,5,B01GGE7BTQ,"if you like westerns and aren't afraid of language, violence and blood, Outlaws and Angels is the movie for you. The violence and gore aren't just attention-getters, they're a strong dose of what you don't usually see in a western--what really happened in the Old West. Life was brutal and survival was the only thing. Mollner captured that convincingly and has challenged conventional wisdom about how the Old West was.

The movie is probably the most thought-provoking western I've ever seen and makes me question some of my beliefs about family, struggle, retribution, vengeance, forgiveness, and faith.

It's an engaging story that unfolds in layers. Some of the people you think are good are not. Some you think are bad might be heroes. You won't see the ending coming, so hold on to your hats.

The nuts and bolts parts of the movie--the cinematography, sound, lighting, editing, writing, all of it-- are top notch. The cast was fantastically chosen with each person fitting the role they played well.

I don't watch many movies more than once. This will be one I do. I forgot I was watching a movie and my imagination took over--probably every filmmakers desire.",1469318400,4,1169,4.918781725888325

7760182,3,B01GGE7BTQ,"It seems another member of Clint Eastwood's brood is ready for stardom.

Francesca Eastwood, 22, his daughter with actor Frances Fisher, is one of the bright lights in writer-director JT Mollner's otherwise uneven feature debut, Outlaws and Angels, a violent and perverse paen to the trashy spaghetti westerns and giallos that Italy pumped out in the 1970s.

A low-budget heist story that's been marinated in a seriously twisted and disturbing sense of humor, Outlaws and Angels stars Chad Michael Murray as Henry, the leader of a gang of thugs who seek shelter at a preacher's remote farmhouse after pulling off a blood-soaked bank robbery in New Mexico.

Farscape's Ben Browder sports a squirrel's tail of a mustache as the preacher George Tildon, who cowers as the four bad men attack his wife (a Bible-thumping Teri Polo) and two teenage daughters, the mean-spirited Charlotte (Madisen Beaty) and bullied baby sister Flo (Eastwood).

Thing is, Flo ain't too upset about being taken hostage. She falls head over heels for Henry, telling him about the horrible Cinderella life she's lived with her hateful family.

She admits she wants to be an outlaw.

Eastwood and Murray are wonderful together, playing off each other's growing psychosis as they egg each other on to rain holy hell on the rest of the family.

The lively cast includes Francesca Eastwood's real-life mom Fisher, Nathan Russell, and Luke Wilson - who does a madcap turn as an ax-wielding bounty hunter who goes after Henry and his crew.

Mollner has had some serious film-fest success with his short films, including Flowers in December and The Red Room.

He's an inventive filmmaker, although here prone to dropping too many hipper-than-thou references to the mega-violent flicks of Quentin Tarantino, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone.

When he's not trying so hard and takes the time to do his own thing, he creates enjoyably twisted satire.",1469145600,12,1912,5.079872204472843
