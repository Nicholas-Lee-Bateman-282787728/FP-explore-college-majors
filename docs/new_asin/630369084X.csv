699545,5,630369084X,"Video Violence 1 has a good story to it and well executed. I love seeing a video store with vhs tapes, something I grew up with. It has lots of gore and the meat slicer part was probably one of the best scenes i've seen in awhile. After seeing many horror fans rave about this, I can see why. A must own for horror buffs.

Video Violence 2 is one of those sequels that takes what people enjoyed from part one and shows it more. Homer and Eli now have there own tv show and it's pretty entertaining and sick. It's not as good as part one but still very fun to watch.

Overall, a must have for any horror fan. Two great movies for one low price and plenty of gore.",1252454400,,662,4.007575757575758
699546,1,630369084X,"Then you here you. ""Video Violence"" is one of those movies that are so poorly made than any attempt to elevate it beyond junk would be unrealistic.

However, it's quite a different story when you write a review on something like this and say that this is ""classic junk!!!"" (which it is).

Director Gary Cohen made himself a winner of a trashy flick(I never heard of it till years later and with most OOP flicks this one is probably best left unfound). The story itself is just a setup for gore, trash and brief nude scenes setup to entice the viewer. Just think of a very cheap porno movie and you know what production values to expect.

The story is about a couple (not really bright as seen by the *ahem* ""twist"" ending) that stumbles upon a town's secret...which I won't spoil. I'll just say that it centers around the production of snuff movies.

The acting is poor, very poor. Even if these guys had looked at the script ahead of the time, it wouldn't have changed their performance!!!

Of course all this adds to novelty of junk films like this. You love to see how bad they are and thus put them in the classic category of ""it's so bad, it's good"".

I will say though that the villians in this flick are disgusting and horrendous and to an extent lifelike of what you would find in the minds of any serial killer. If this was a movie produced on a Hollywood budget with big name actors (think Vacancy), then a movie like this would have gotten more attention.

I heard there is a DVD release, but I wouldn't spend a dime on it. For me this is one of those flicks that are at best worth a buck or two and you save them for those special times when you and your buddies are kicking back but not a flick that you would spend money on. The movie has memorable lines at well...including one cameraman who mutters ""did I miss anything"" when he wants to know if he miss any gore that didn't get caught on film.

Anyhow, worth a rent for a laugh but nothing more unless you're really into this kind of flicks.",1191196800,,2008,4.3076923076923075
699547,5,630369084X,"Please, pick up this DVD.  If you're a fan of low-budget consumer camcorder shot movies from the 80s (and especially if you tried to make them) you'll love it.  Video Violence 1 is actually a great movie, with a great story.  It centers around a small community with a secret that gets ""exposed"" when someone returns the wrong video to the local video rental store.  Pretty neat!  Acting is above average for most lower budget flicks from this time.  PLUS, there are tons of shots of the interior of an awesome video rental store with big box rentals.  Now that's already a part of americana's past.  Video Violence 2 is not quite the thriller that part 1 is, but it has it's moments.  It's a much more humerous sequel.  Still good, though.

This is one of the more respectable attempts put to digital format coming from the Retro 80's collection, though it's hard to find these days, and even harder to find it priced reasonably.",1503619200,,387,4.791044776119403

7852514,5,630369084X,"If you really like gore movies or if your a gorehound like me, then this movie is for you! I'm a serious movie collector and I must say that this movie is just one of the goriest movies I have ever discovered in my life. I watched this movie on VHS tape when I was a kid and it didn't seem to be really appealing to me at that time, but now I really love all the gore it has to offer. It's better on dvd. The second movie could use some improvements. It's not as good as the 1st one, however you still may like it anyway. It repeats a lot of the snuff films from the 1st movie on there. I thought it was more funny than scary especially when Ike made that electric chair. I think you'll bust a gut laughing at it! It's like Ripley's Believe It Or Not on crack. Anyway, I recommend the 1st one for sure.",1456963200,3,802,3.9263803680981595

7852516,5,630369084X,"Gary P. Cohen made these films on a NO-string budget in 1986 -87 and IS the dirt-bag answer to anti-snuffs-ploitation and pays very slap-happy $2 tribute to hershell gordon lewis via the old-days of D.I.Y. horror while making fun of off-the-grid television stations like channel 56 which had wally george on it back in the 1980's and public access tv in general and proves anybody with just a whisky napkin of an idea, bring your friends in for the fun of it, cam-corder, new jersey, azusa, covina, small town usa, no expectations neighborhood cinema, anti-domestic bully, video-tape era, trade amongst your friends gore film and i love stuff like this, becasue at the heart of this film is the soul of a civil libertarian punk-rocker whom just wanted to be seen/heard and was a ma 'n' pa video store owner himself and i am very proud he still remembers the old-school reagan days of america when we the people were left to our own ""devices"" especially those whom cared only about the blue-collar crowd and loathed the don of wall-street ""trump"" just because we could.

7852519,3,630369084X,"I had no experience with ""SOV"" horror films before watching Video Violence, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with it. The gore effects are excellent, and in a world obsessed with CGI nowadays, it's always good to see practical gore effects done so well. For the most part, it's a fairly light-hearted and over the top little movie, but there are a few scenes which are genuinelly unnerving. The acting is OK-(highlights include The Sheriff and Eli) and although the script has a few plotholes, you really have to overlook them for this sort of movie.  Also worth getting purely to see the inside of a 80's video store, which I really enjoyed seeing, and will give many viewers a great sense of nostalgia. It also has one of the coolest opening music themes of all time. However, I must say the movie does overstay its welcome a little, clocking in at over 95 minutes.

3.5 out of 5

The other film on the DVD is Video Violence 2. Which I did not like at all. The whole thing felt so pointless and didn't really have a plot. The gore effects weren't as impressive either. The scene with the sheriff and his electric chair was the sole highlight in the whole film. At least it only goes for 75 minutes.

7852521,5,630369084X,"I found VIDEO VIOLENCE, a shot-on-video horror movie from 1987, to have an interesting social commentary in its depiction of a small town obsessed with making their own ""splatter"" films. We live in a time where people are videotaping things like tornadoes, fights, and stunt attempts; the Internet, and YouTube in particular, has made it easier for people to achieve some kind of recognition. Watching VIDEO VIOLENCE today, it's not hard to find parallels between the storyline and what's happening with the Internet today. The sequel, which takes the splatter to public-access television, further exemplifies this point, especially the commercials. Intentionally or not, VIDEO VIOLENCE is right up there with THE RUNNING MAN (of the same year) and David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME as a strangely prophetic depiction of the lengths people will go to see sex and violence.

Gary P. Cohen states in the interview that this movie came about after a mother entered the video store where he worked (with a 5 year-old daughter in tow, no less) and rented I DISMEMBER MAMA. The mother asked if it had any nudity, and Cohen said that he didn't know but it had violence. The mother said that as long as it had no nudity, it would be acceptable for kids to watch. (There's a re-enactment of that moment in VIDEO VIOLENCE.) This also adds a satirical element in that it takes on the concerns of most people that violent movies cause people to commit violent acts. (The ""Pizza Boy"" scene in VIDEO VIOLENCE 2 furthers this point.) If one were to remake VIDEO VIOLENCE, it would make for an interesting satire on the Internet era and how people are affected by it.",1272499200,3,1647,4.8612099644128115
