764647,5,6304039565,"This has got to be the greatest movie of all time!  I enjoyed all the dialogue in it -- there's a lot of witty remarks, comebacks, and jokes.  The acting by Colonel Fell is terrific.  But I think the thing that gets me  the most are the exchanges between the two main characters, Colonel Kane  and Captain Cutshaw.  They discuss the problem of how a loving God could  possibly create a world in which ""all of creation is based on dog eat  dog, and the little fish are eaten by the big fish"", a world in which  people suffer.  There's a very human element to this movie, even though it  is sometimes advertised as a horror movie.  The movie as a whole, but  especially the final scenes, are very touching.",922752000,4,704,4.323076923076923
764648,5,6304039565,"I originally saw this film in the theatre and never forgot it.  If you have the chance to see it, don't pass it by.  Stacy Keach is wonderful and yet you can't help to feel sorry for him.  He manages to save the men from  their insane lives for brief moments and finds his own salvation during the  process.  The barroom fight scene is the most memorable you will ever see.",922579200,2,373,4.183098591549296
764649,5,6304039565,"A secluded retrofit for the battle fatigued who might be less than forthcoming with the real reasons they are present. Enter Keach. The first scene, as he drives up, is amazing. The actors, many who you will  immediately recognize, are great. The writing witty, introspective and  clipped to the right pace. Blatty's sleeper is a wonderful respite from the  wholly violent, non- thinking films all to present today. I enjoy the film  and have seen it many times. One word of  caution. Once started, don't  leave. There are many points that speed by and if you miss 'em, well, you  will have missed the movie. Great flick.",919296000,3,621,4.747663551401869
764650,5,6304039565,"During the Vietnam war, an abandoned castle in the Pacific Northwest becomes the site of a highly experimental mental hospital for shell-shocked soldiers (who may be faking).  Psychiatrist Colonel Kane (Keach), arrives  to take over and begins to earn the grudging trust of the patients,  especially Capt. Billy Cutshaw (Scott Wilson).  Thing is, Kane's got issues  of his own... This is a brilliant movie which manages to combine humor,  violence, madness and theological angst with a what-the-hell-was-that pace  that will put blisters on your eyeballs.  Unfortunately, for some reason,  this film is virtually unknown.  If not for the wonder of cable TV, I'd've  missed it myself, but now it's one of my all-time favorites. In short, SEE  THIS MOVIE!  NOW!",916444800,4,759,5.225
764651,5,6304039565,"It's hard to categorize this movie.  You'd expect horror from William Peter Blatty, the man who gave us unforgettable scares (and new uses for pea soup) in the Exorcist.  But nothing is what it seems to be in this film. Ninth Configuration takes place in an imported European castle nestled deep in the Pacific  Northwest.  In it are housed an interesting group of inmates: high-ranking military officers, and one astronaut, who are all suffering from inexplicable mental disorders.  They are isolated, and given unconventional therapies in an attempt to  determine if they are truly ill, or merely slacking. Since nothing seems to work, a new head shrink is called in.  His name:  Kane, played by a wonderfully stoic Stacy Keach.  He immediately makes an impression on the inmates, truly listening to them, and in some cases indulging their whims.  But there are undercurrents here; Kane seems to have a past, which figures into the development of the story, and ultimately, the ending. What makes this movie so fun to watch is the excellent acting, mostly from genre actors, such as Joe Spinell. The dialogue is clever, and the movie actually makes you THINK.  There's a lot of talk about good and evil, and the hows and whys of man's existence. All in all, a great movie well worth getting.  END",897782400,9,1298,4.85

764771,1,6304039565,"The best thing about it is the title image of an astronaut and Christ on the cross.  At times I wasn't sure if I was watching some kind of bad comedy or a really inept drama.  The acting, except for Stacy Keach is way over the top.  Not to mention how this ninth configuration idea has anything to do with the main story of the Stacy Keach character.  I guess they thought that if they let the guy that wrote the Exorcist make a movie on his own it would be great.  They were completely wrong.  Friedkin made the exorcist great.  This film suffers from focus and direction.  Have a nice day.",1482537600,,591,4.214285714285714

764778,5,6304039565,"I saw this sometime around 1990 in my late teens an it made a big impression on me. I agree with another reviewer, it is a one of a kind movie. Too hard to explain. There is some violence, but I think no matter how disturbing it is, it is probably the best kind of scenario for violence in a movie. Sort of like the violent scenes in Pan's Labyrinth....uncomfortable and disturbing but necessary for the movie to work. It might be a bit of a guy movie...maybe??

Already a Keach fan, Mike Hammer of course, but after seeing this movie, I have a whole new level of respect for the actor. I think it is his best work.

Same director as The Exorcist, etc.

764952,4,6304039565,"Over looked upon its release ""The Ninth Configuration"" takes a page from Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" setting a mystery in an asylum for the mentally unstable. This film is more than a mystery though as the inmates dig into questions of metaphysics and the fine line between sanity and insanity that we all walk.

Stacey Keach (who replaced Nichol Williamson in the role)plays Col. Kane a psychatrist with an unconventional approach sent to #18 a mental instutition. He's there to determine who is sane and who is playing at being insane. Kane find all of the inmates challenging but one of the inmates a former astronaut named Cutshaw (Scott Wilson) suspects that Kane himself is insane and doesn't realize it. Cutshaw was placed there after losing it after canceling his own launch to the moon.

""The Ninth Configuration"" is the second part of a trilogy examining good and evil by writer/director William Peter Blatty. The first part was ""The Exorcist"" directed by William Friedkin (who was originally supposed to direct ""The Ninth Configuration"")and written by William Peter Blatty based on his novel. The third part of the trilogy was ""Exorcist III"" which Blatty wrote and directed from his novel ""Legion"". Each part intersects with the other with the character of Cutshaw appearing in ""The Exorcist"" (he's the astronaut that Regan states will die in space).

""The Ninth Configuration"" remains an unusual film with dark comic elements infused into the drama. It's not for everyone but it is quite brilliant.

The Hen's Tooth blu-ray features the best looking transfer of ""The Ninth Configuration"" that has ever appeared. Unfortunately, it isn't a perfect presentation simply because of the way the film was shot, the type of film stock used to shoot the film  at the time. Don't be fooled by the condition of the opening titles--the film does improve in image quality but it is variable with the image sometimes being soft, other times with a nice detailed image. Regardless, this improves on the DVD release with bolder colors and image quality. There is a glitch during the opening titles that occurs (possibly due to the damage of the negative) but, aside from that, the film plays smoothly from beginning to end. ""The Ninth Configuration"" will never be mistaken for a demo disc for blu-ray but fans will be happy with the improved quality. The film transfer is a at a healthy 29.99 Mbps on a 50 gig disc.

The film did receive a 70mm presentation at one time (blown up from 35mm)with a multi-track mix but, unforuntatley, the multi-track mix is missing. Since the multi-track and original multi's are missing, we are stuck with a mono presentation of the soundtrack. The mono sounds quite good.

Hen's Tooth ports over the special features from the Warner Brothers DVD including Blatty's (moderated by film critic Mark Kermode)commentary track which provides some insight into why Blatty felt the need to continually recut the film and his approach to shooting the film (also he provides some interesting trivia about shooting on location in Russia).

We also get an a featurette with film critic Mark Kermode (and interviews with Blatty) focusing on the meaning of the film.

Rounding out the special features are 20 minutes of outtakes from the film presented in 480i.

We also get a DVD in addition to the BR disc.

Although ""The Ninth Configuration"" isn't a perfect blu-ray, it improves on previous editions of the film on home video and features some terrific special features.",1416528000,4,3486,4.982788296041308
764953,5,6304039565,If it were possible to give this film more than 5 stars I would. My favorite movie of all time. The little quips between characters and intense portrayal of Colonel Kane by Stacy Keach make it very unique. The amazing ending is reason enough to watch. The final frame still sends a chill down my spine and with feeling of joy. Blatty is still my favorite author and The Ninth Configuration has cemented him as my favorite director as well.,1412899200,4,439,4.5

764989,5,6304039565,"This is the kind of movie that will alter the way you decide to choose your movies, whether or not you are for it or against it. To me, this is the best film ever made, harrowing, humorous, underappreciated, and absolutely unforgettable (ironic, for a film that is always watched more than once--that right there should tell you something about the level of quality at work here). I find it fascinating how many reviewers are comparing this movie to today's market offerings; they seem to point out the acting, the pacing, and the story. And they are right because ""The Ninth Configuration"" represents a by-gone era of great filmmaking and great acting that will never be repeated in this way ever again. I can't say anything more about it.
The DVD edition does have an annoying hissing/mist sound traversing through the first half of the movie; the sound is not remastered at all, and the picture seems to be a sub-standard transfer. In my dreams, I am seeing a newly released BluRay with a new audio commentary by Blatty and Keach, a three-hour 'making of' feature with never before seen footage; a complete 4 minute cut of the fight sequence in the bar, and a new interview with Scott Wilson about the film, and an archived one from Jason Miller. Plus, additional radio spots and TV trailers. Oh, if only...What is most annoying is that my old VHS copy seems to have better sound and picture than this current release, and I am very upset with that aspect of the DVD. However, the Mark Kermode/Blatty commentary track offered here is very good indeed and very much worth hearing; the deleted scenes are welcome but could have used Blatty's video introduction to each; the very short 'making of'/introductory piece is good, but not nearly extensive at all. Hopefully one day Blatty will issue a definitive BluRay cut of his masterful film. I am a fan of ""The Exorcist"" too, but ""The Ninth Configuration"" stands head and shoulders above the rest of rare and unusual movies that are out there.

If there are enough of them, and the writers have a strong concensus of opinion, I consider them a useful guide, and a safeguard between me and a waste of time and money.  Occasionally, they have been a bit deceptive.  Never have I seen a movie that came so close to fooling all the people all the time.  Actually, I watched about half an hour of this turkey, and then thought it would be amusing to look it up on Amazon, and see what funny one-star reviews I could read.  Assuming that everyone else would be as appalled at it as I was, I didn't plan to finish watching it.  My jaw dropped, and I laughed with disbelief as I saw the average rating, and read a few five-star reviews lauding this poorly conceived, amateurishly directed mess.  Luckily, I found a couple of one-star reviews, to reassure me that I hadn't been transported to another (highly inferior) world.  Some of the writers insisted that if I only watched the whole thing, it would prove itself to me, and all would be revealed.  Or something.  Alas.  It remained a pretentious waste, trying so hard to seem deep or at least mysterious.  I can only hope that there won't be too many unfortunates who are tricked into watching (or buying!) this thing, and that those who actually gave it great reviews are enjoying themselves, feeling oh so superior to us poor barbarians who just don't get it.  I suggest you watch something else, like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Awakenings"", ""Girl, Interrupted"", ""The Snake Pit"", ""Rain Man"", or ""The Ruling Class"", instead.

Blatty takes on fear, loneliness and God with a dash of mental illness for flavor.  Vets of all people just can't admit their fear, and unwittingly become slaves to it.  Fear and faith are both things that mankind struggles to understand while courting an addiction to science.  Science cannot even explain human love, yet we cling to it, like dope, hoping that maybe next time it will work on our problems.  So, what is truth?  It's unfailing love in the heart of each human being; and science is grievously jealous and impotent.",1362096000,2,635,4.575221238938053
764995,5,6304039565,"I was a bit of a fanatic about this film when it first came out. I worked across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theater when the Ninth Configuration showed for only one week. At that time, it's title was ""Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane"". I was blown away by the film and saw it three times during that run. A few weeks after it closed, it appeared on a cable channel called ""On T.V."" as a special showing ""One time, One night only"". I taped it and still have that scratchy VHS in my collection. The film disappeared after that.

There are three cuts to this film that I know of. About a year after it's opening in Hollywood, I read about a showing of the film near Capistrano, CA. I made the trip and saw the film in it's second cut. More dialog was added and a few things were changed that altered the mood and mystery of the piece. To be honest, I was disappointed. For instance in the original cut, when Cutshaw goes back and visits the clinic at the end of the film, the door to Kane's office swings open slowly on it's own. That is what draws Cutshaw to the room where he reads Kane's letter. Also, it was not clear in the original cut that Kane took his own life, it appeared as if he had been stabbed by the biker (which still would have given Cutshaw his ""one example""). Perhaps the original version was too subtle. Then there is the San Antone song that I personally thought was a horrible addition to the film and so out of place. San Antone?? It's been years and I'm still not gettin' it. There are other subtle changes, too many to list here. Most involve expanded dialog. Blatty appears to have tried tinkering with his film several times in an effort to make it more commercial or more like the book.

The third cut is the commercial DVD release of the film which I think is the worst of the lot. Of course I am basing this on having seen the original which was my favorite edit.  There is a PAL version of the film for sale which reads ""Original Version"". It's not the original version but it is about as close as you are going to get to the original edit of ""Twinkle"". It's actually the second edit. It does have the weird San Antone song at the beginning. I edited out that little prologue in a copy I made for myself. If you skip the music montage at the beginning, it's about as close as you are going to come to the original experience and what I think is the best version of the work.

This is an extremely powerful film about powerful themes. Scott Wilson's performance was off the charts great. His monologue at the window is stunningly beautiful. Stacy Keach has done great work all his life and this is one of the finest performances in his catalog. The film is full of great actors. Blatty as the doctor who is not a doctor. Flanders, Loggia, Jason Miller all treat this as though it were a labor of love.

If you can get it and play it, get the PAL version and skip the prologue and go right to the countdown. It's the wildest of rides! Highly recommended.",1360627200,4,2983,4.272566371681416
764996,5,6304039565,"If you've never seen/heard anything about this movie but stumbled upon it, then let me say that its truly a unknown(ish) gem. Although its the true sequel to The Exorcist (lets not laugh too much at Exorcist 2....ok I guess so) its not horrific per se. It deals with the same motifs of guilt, acceptance and redemption, but its umm funny. Not kinda smirking, but laugh out loud funny. Weird...an Exorcist sequel thats not only very thoughful (I can imagine a lot of dicussions after watching this) but thoroughly engaging, emotional and quite brilliant. Writer of the Exorcist, William Blatty, also directs and makes great use of the setting and situations. Scott Wilson is nothing short of superb as the reluctant astronaut turned mental patient. I won't give away the plot points (as I'm sure they're readily available), but the entire movie is something to behold. Not easily catagorized (I pity the marketing team that had to advertise this) but a true cinematic masterpiece.

765059,4,6304039565,"For me this is two thirds of a great film, a bit let down by a final act that gets a little too didactic and simplistic in it's ideas, and a touch too obvious in its twists.

At an isolated asylum U.S. soldiers are either faking madness to avoid war, or are really crazy, or some of both. There's also an astronaut who's mission had to be scrubbed when he had a last minute breakdown in the capsule, (wonderfully played by the brilliant and often sadly underused Scott Wilson).

A top military psychiatrist, played by Stacy Keach, is brought in to try to figure out who is who, madman or faker. But very quickly it's clear that Keach's own character, Kane, has more than his own share of demons.

The film is an unique and often successful mix of tones, from high comedy (one of the inmates is trying to stage Shakespeare with an all dog cast), to deep philosophical talk, to action, to mystery. And in the end it is a very religious film, most of all.

The cast is great from top to bottom, and the cinematography is very strong as well.

Some critics see this as an overlooked masterpiece, one of the best films of it's time. Although others are far more tempered, and some downright scornful.

I'm much more towards the positive, but for me the somewhat simplistic and heavy handed nature of its final central themes and arguments damages the wonderful, often loony and bewildering complexity of what has preceded it.

Still this is well worth seeing. A film that bravely strives for greatness and comes up a little short will always win my heart before the mass of films that don't strive at all.",1349049600,,1600,4.496551724137931

765066,5,6304039565,"The Ninth Configuration is quite simply the very best movie ever made.  A lot has to be taken into consideration when reviewing the best movie. I will keep it short and sweet. The movie is described as a supernatural thriller and it is that and even more.  I saw this in movie theaters when released as a kid, and thought it was great, and some 30 years later it ranks #1 in my book.  First, the plot is multilayered.  There are many plots within the plot.  Secondly, although the movie is a supernatural thriller, it is also a comedy.  The jokes will have you rolling.  The acting is wonderful and after watching several times over the years, it is crafted with perfection relative to the emotion due to the subject matter of the film.  Ok, now, the horrible truth.  Today, film quality has been enhanced and greatly improved, so you will notice that this is an older film; however, it remains a top film for its plot, acting, and character placement, editing, storyline, humor, ability to make one think etc.....  This movie is considered by many a classic. Buyer be aware that there are several versions of the film.  I do not want to spoil the movie, so I will just say that I enjoyed the original theatrical version better.  This version shows the alternate ending in a weird clip of super low quality.  The alternate ending was the original theatrical ending.  It is, in my opinion, a better ending.  It is my hope that someday that this original ending will be made into a disk version like the video tape version.  All in all, this movie will make one think, ponder, and wrestle with many facets of life.  On the surface, a great movie.  Below the surface, a little slice of heaven on earth.  If you are 18 or older and you have not seen this movie, you are missing out on one of the truly great movies.  If you are 18 or older and really enjoy movies and have not seen this movie, then you have missed the very best.  To provide an idea from the reviewer perspective: Best song ever: U2 - Where the streets have no name, Best novel (tie) The Brothers Karamazov & The Lord of the rings; best movie - The Ninth Configuration.

765117,3,6304039565,"I hadn't seen this film for many years and had even forgotten it existed. When if entered my radar I immediately wanted to see it again as I remembered liking it a lot. Upon viewing it again I was a bit torn. Yes, all the good things these other reviewers have said about it are correct. It's witty, well acted, well directed. There is mature discourse concerning faith in God and Good vs. Evil.

I suppose where I have a difficult time is the depiction of the inmates. I cannot say that these people are crazy. Eccentric, yes. Crazy?.................no. Films such as ""King of Hearts"" or even ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" depict mentally ill people this way. As though they are merely lost in LaLa Land when mental illness is, in fact, very sad and horrible. There are scenes in other movies (""The Exorcist"" comes to mind) that show it in a truer form. These inmates are clever, thoughtful and amusing. They can speak intelligently on complex subjects and consider mounting productions of Shakespeare using dogs. Colin Wilson defined going crazy as the loss of will. These guys still have their will. Now, we do find out that Cutshaw is faking it (sorry for the spoiler). He does so out of fear of dying out in space alone. Nothing crazy about that. But what of the rest of these guys? Are they really nuts or are they disguising some similar fear?

I don't want to take too much from this movie. It's well worth seeing for any number of reasons. And whatever anyone says about the bar room fight is true and maybe then some. This is a wake up call to much of what happens previously in the movie. I give it three stars and it's really Three and a half because there really is so much worth seeing here.

The viewer is put off-balance from the start -- and this is refreshed by the many odd turns-and-twists as the presentation flows along -- like a wildly zigzaging Northwest greenwood whitewater stream. The ""Pacific Northwest Castle"" is in Hungary by-the-way -- that misty rainy greenwood sure LOOKS like here [Pacific Northwest]. The winding road up to the Castle looks like adventure too.

Indeed the foreground and background settings are used thru-out in accord or discord with the dialog and activity of the excellent words, acting and actors. They not only have some of the most witty, clever, intellegent lines EVER -- but act with wonderfully fitting feeling via eyes, voice and body -- which does get VERY INTENSE many times.

The Exorcist is the ultimate study of evil in modern cinema.  This film is the ultimate modern study of goodness.

I greatly admire The Exorcist, but I love this film.  It's as facinating as The Exorcist, but far more challenging to the viewer.  For those who take the trouble to understand it, it's far more rewarding, as well.  It's inspiring and profound.  It's something that stays with you, in the best possible way.

I had nightmares about The Exorcist many years ago as a child, but this film inspires the best kind of waking dreams and visions of goodness, and awakening to something far beyond mere entertainment.  It's a film for adults, and one that tries to be profound - and succeeds.

If goodness and oneness with the Source of all goodness is the meaning of life, as all true philosphers, begining with Plato, believe it is, then this film just might be the most successful at bringing this idea to the screen ever made.  But this is not just a film of ideas.  It's a film of depth of both thought and feeling.  It's a film, as Blatty himself says, of love.

Maybe this film is not for all tastes, as some have said.  But, if you believe that life has meaning, and that visionary depictions of goodness can inspire a life of meaning, as Plato himself did, then this film is not to be missed.

765125,5,6304039565,"Although spoilers exist all throughout the internet pertaining to The Ninth Configuration, they are to be ignored at all costs.  Those who read them are cheating themselves, and those who write them are gravely insulting this fine movie.  People who watch this film for the first time without any expectations, preconceived notions, or any other ideas as to how the movie ends are to be envied.  One reviewer was very smart to add in his/her review that you don't ask a great filmmaker if they seen this before, you ask them how many times.  Even most of the negative reviews are about the DVD transfer (which I'll admit does leave something to be desired) and not the actal film quality.

Being one the first films to deal with Vietnam Era Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Apocalypse Now being another), TNC was one the first great films of the 1980s.  Here, the military commandeers an abandoned medieval castle in the Pacific Northwest(?) to treat a group of highly intelligent, but mentally unbalanced soldiers who may or may not be faking their ailments.  The patients range from an artistic type who tries to turn the facility into his own version of the Sistine Chapel to one who directs his own Shakespearean productions - starring dogs!  There is also a multiple personality case who one day believes he is a German scientist who can walk through walls and a foul-mouthed nun the next.  Now the story takes an even sharper turn toward the bizarre.

A seeming compassionate and understanding Dr. Hudson Kane (an amazing performance by Stacy Keach) transfers to the facility.  His treatment of patients at first appears to be calm and nonjudgmental, even when the patients become belligerent.  His most challenging case is Capt. Cutshaw, a Marine astronaut who saw no actual combat, but lost his nerve before his rocket blasted off.  At this point, some of the patients begin to wonder about Kane's sanity.  And to make matters more complicated, in order for Kane to get to the bottom of Cutshaw's problem, he has to confront some very uncomfortable truths about himself.

You may hear it a lot of times; but in this case the words ""They don't make'em like they use to"" definitely apply.  Rarely does a film nowadays explore spirituality in a positive way that TNC did.  For all of its profanity, bleak themes, and a very violent bar fight; it is one of the most uplifting and life-affirming films I have ever seen.  It has often been said something cannot be both intellectual and religious.  This film takes that myth and rips it to shreds.  Unlike some ""religious"" movies that try to push an agenda down the viewer's throat via emotional pandering (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>, anyone?), TNC uses logic.

765168,5,6304039565,"""The Ninth Configuration"" will be one of the most confusing, rich and absolutely bizarre films you've ever seen (if you do see it, which seems unlikely).

Based on William Peter Blatty's fairly confusing and average novel, he seems to work far better as a screenwriter than a novelist (with the exception, perhaps, of ""The Exorcist"") with a middleman to guide his otherworldly ideas into a more concrete and understandable cinematic form.  Even still, this is one zany smorgasboard of a film: set in an abandoned Gothic Castle where insane and frustrated Vietnam veterans are observed--it seems--by the ominously serene and kind Army psychiatrist Col. Kane, played with a sort of demented Gary Cooper style by Scott
Wilson.

Jason Miller is a soldier who won the Congressional Medal of Honor and who now prefers teaching Shakespeare to dogs than fighting in combat.  As he recites some of Julius Caesar to his pooch, determined that the little furry mop will be a star on the stage, he remarks to the bemmused Ed Flanders: ""It's a labor of love, but someone's gotta do it.""  Another AWOL black soldier dresses up in a Superman costume, has a taste for blackface, and frequently loses his pants.  The dialogue ranges from serious literary discourse to unbearable pretentiousness.

Wilson's Captain Cutshaw and Stacy Keach's Kane are the most important characters in this mind bogglingly complex meditation on the true nature of man and the cosmos.  No one is quite who they seem, least of all the gentle Col. Kane.  As stone gargoyles hover (not unlike the one we see confronted by Father Merrin in ""The Exorcist"") and a St. Christopher's medal becomes the vehicle for a recurring and horrific flashback, things slowly fall into place like the notes of a deranged piano score.  You really can't talk about the film's plot without revealing it, and part of this amazing experience is the gradual discovery of truth about the characters; in order to believe in Col. Kane, however, one has to believe in a sense that a man like Barnes from Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" could reform himself and start reading Teilhard De Chardin.  This is what Blatty asks, however, and without patronizing anyone: the belief in the redemption of the individual no matter what the circumstances.

This is one powerhouse of a film and in a certain sense one needs a strong stomach and an active mind to appreciate it; the themes touch the very core of human life.  Watching it once is kind of fruitless unless you're extremely quick on the uptake.  The self sacrificial gesture at the end is something one has to ponder to take seriously.  All flaws aside, though, and there are many, one has to admire this sometimes goofy but painfully sincere effort on the part of Blatty.  One of the most memorable films I've had the privilege to see.",1195257600,6,2812,4.863731656184487
765169,4,6304039565,"Someone loaned me a copy of this about 2 years ago.  I finally watched it tonight.  You can learn two things about me from this:  1.  I have too much of a backlog of unwatched and unplayed stuff to get to anything quickly; and 2.  Don't lend me anything you want to see back soon.

I can see some people not loving this movie.  At first, it feels like a cross between M*A*S*H (complete with vets in drag a la Klinger) and Cuckoo's Nest.  What looks like the original ""mystery"", whether the vets at the creepy castle/hospital are faking their illnesses, is superseded by a bigger one...what's the deal with Stacy Keach's character?  (Keach plays the most humorless, tightly-wound shrink ever.  He is excellent.)  The way that mystery unfolds feels brilliant.  However, by the end the movie had abandoned the inmates whose behaviors were so compelling at its outset.  Then, as the movie progresses, Blatty develops his philosophical theme that some may have difficulty with.  Through some superbly-acted scenes between Keach and Scott Wilson, Blatty questions God's existence in the face of all life's misery.  Without the crowd-pleasing horror, this is Blatty taking the 'Good v. Evil' issue from the ""The Exorcist"" quite a few steps further.

Too few of the reviews I've read tonight acknowlege Ed Flanders' work here.  As in ""St. Elsewhere,"" he is once again the soul of sanity in the midst of chaos.  His understated comedic acting in the movie's first half is (synonym for ""brilliant"" which I already used); yet, his reaction in his last scene is absolutely heartbreaking.  My favorite part of going through the film a second time was seeing how some of his dialogue and expressions, puzzling the first time around, ended up making perfect sense.  [To digress, Flanders' passing has always bothered me.  He seemed sincerely nice in ""real life"" and I was sorry to learn (like most of us, too late) he'd suffered from depression.  I recall Betty White, on a talk show, admitting to a crush on him after she guest-starred on ""St. Elsewhere.""  They may have even dated after that.  I thought they'd be a perfect couple...I wish he could have found happiness.]

There are unresolved issues and (apparent) possible plot flaws aplenty:  here are the ones that bug me so far...If Kane's assignment was a mistake caught early on, how did Fell have time to learn and theorize about Kane's inner motivations for following through with his ruse?  Why was Kane able to go out and rescue Cutshaw alone, especially after what we'd just learned?  I was also disappointed in the lack of closure between Kane and Fell.  Kane had to have realized what Fell had done on his behalf.  There is no payoff for the character of Fell despite those efforts.  Next...what the hell happened to the other inmates?  We see that one has recovered (and been promoted), but the state of the castle in the last scene had me wondering if the other guys weren't inmates at all, but just placed there to help Kane.  Then I realized that couldn't be.  Right?  (Much) Less importantly, Why does the lead biker (and only the lead biker) wear eyeliner?  And how did said eyeliner get him to be leader of a scuzzy biker gang rather than just beaten up?

The features include a mostly helpful, somewhat pedantic commentary from Blatty and a bunch of outtakes whose accompanying on-screen explanations are very helpful and interesting.  They make it clear that other versions of this film exist that edit out crucial parts.  Caveat Emptor.  Well, I started this movie at 8:15 p.m. and, dear Foot, it's now 2:42 a.m.  Good night everybody.",1191888000,2,3596,4.800978792822186

The acting is sensational, Keach is great as the coiled, barely keeping his demons at bay Col Kane, and Scott Wilson is Oscar calibre as the sensitive, burned out Astronaut.

Now that I've seen it, I'm belatedly spreading the word about it to all my friends.

I don't know if I'm more amazed by Blatty's skill as a writer or a director. I'm bowled over by every aspect of this production. It's hard to single out any one thing, because there are too many things to praise. I guess I'm most impressed by Blatty's skill in weaving a very intricate story. The first half hour doesn't make any sense, but we can still tell we're on to something great. We can simply sit back and enjoy the incredible dialogue. The rest of the movie fulfills its early promise. The plot comes together in a delightfully complex way. Blatty skillfully throws in a couple twists I didn't see coming. And it's all held together by Keach's brooding performance.

Beneath the surface mysteries of the characters' true identities and inner motivations, the core of the film deals with the question of the existence of God. Blatty spins out an intricate and compelling argument for God's existence. As an atheist, I didn't buy his argument, but I was very impressed with it on an emotional level.

If you step beck, you're forced to admit that the whole scenario of the movie is ridiculously improbable. But Blatty's skill in telling the story more than makes up for this. Like most of you, I sensed many layers of meaning in this film. But I've only watched it once so far, so I still have many more viewings ahead of me in which I can plumb its depths for the riches I sense are in there.

 Written and directed by William Peter Blatty (he of `The Exorcist' fame,) THE NINTH CONFIGURATION is tough to categorize - is it a comedy? a farce? a science fiction thriller? The movie contains some big surprises, and after it's first act and a half of knock-about comedy settles down to some serious issues. The transition is a bit jarring but overall acceptable.  Hey, you're in for a bumpy ride with this one.  Keach, seeming a little too subdued in the early goings, is just about perfect as the troubled colonel.  Better yet is Scott Wilson, late of `In Cold Blood,' who gives a world-class performance as the grounded astronaut.  Holding them, and the story, together is Ed Flanders.  Really a terrific ensemble cast.

 The disk contains many deleted scenes (we learn Blatty has cut this movie differently many times,) a short featurette hosted by the movie's fan Mark Kermode, and a commentary track with Kermode leading Blatty through the film.  Kermode seems more interested in the film than Blatty, and seems at times struggling to bring the wandering Blatty back to the movie.  If there's a flaw to the movie, and I think there are a couple, Kermode introduces them in the commentary track.  I won't reveal the plot, but this chair strongly believes Blatty should have used the `protection' shot Keach begged Blatty to take - the scene in question occurs late in the movie, and the `protection' shot is included in the deleted scenes section (although the other shot is used in the film.)  We didn't need the letter or Wilson's discovery of the medal, either.  By then we get it already, and Blatty would have had a stronger end without them.  They diffuse rather than build the drama, and I think it's the ending, more than anything, that keeps this off of the top shelf where all the classics are.  Blatty has made his mind up about the movie, and its meaning, but some of the best movies leave the conclusions to be drawn by the audience.  Very good movie, but I was let down by the ending.",1147046400,4,2971,4.82806324110672

Kane (Killer Kane) is provoked to using his ruthless fighting abilities to defend himself and his patient played by Scott Wilson against a biker gang. I am glad to have found that is on DVD and available through Amazon! I purchased it and have reaquainted myself with the film. The fight scene is just as powerful as when I first saw it, but now I can place it into the context of the film! I feel the film is a bit absurd in the way the patients are shown to pretty much run the asylum, which I don't think is plausible within a military controlled institution. However, the performances by Keach and the rest of the cast make up for this and the film is both interesting and exciting. Look for many great actors playing somewhat secondary roles as patients and asylum personnel...Jason Miller, Robert Loggia, Moses Gunn, Neville Brand; all combines to add to the depth of this film. Stacy Keach is excellent as Col. Kane the psychiatrist/patient who is in denial of his war experiences in Vietnam; how this experience applies to his fight with the lowlife bikers is very well done.

Seems that in this bizarre environment it is been attempted to determine whether the inmates are really nuts, or feigning insanity to avoid enlistment. In this isolated, secret military base, the newly appointed commander in charge (marvellously played by Stacy Keach) proves to be more disturbed than the men under his care. The patients (brilliantly portrayed by Scott Wilson, Jason Miller, Brad Dourif, Joe Spinell, George DiCenzo, Robert Loggia, Moses Gunn, and Blatty himself, among others) decide to take matters into their own hands. Each has an apparent hilarious affliction, but as in most of Blatty's work, there is an underlying theme concerning faith and the meaning of life and death. The entire cast is superb. A fascinating, surreal tale with an unexpected ending. (Be forewarned, however: this unsettling film is not for all tastes - the famed barroom fight scene is somewhat uncomfortable).

765246,5,6304039565,"The Ninth Configuration (William Peter Blatty, 1980)

There are some movies that will stay with you after you've turned off the VCR or left the theatre. Some of them will give you a couple of days or weeks of mulling over; others are with you for life. The Ninth Configuration is of the latter variety.

The story revolves around Hudson Kane, an Army psychiatrist (Stacy Keach) sent to a remote asylun in the Pacific Northwest during the closing days of the Vietnam War. Together with the asylum medic, Col. Richard Fell (Ed Flanders, a longtime member of the cast of St. Elsewhere), Kane is tasked with figuring out which of the inmates are really insane and which are just faking it to get out of combat duty. His top priority is recently-committed astronaut Bill Cutshaw (Scott Wilson, recently of Pearl Harbor and The Way of the Gun), who takes an almost perverse interest in Kane, with the two of them immediately set at odds by Kane's Catholicism and Cutshaw's aggressive atheism.

While it is the deeper issue of Cutshaw's lack of faith and Kane's immersion in it that turns an otherwise good film into a great one, even without that particular driving force, this would be a worthwhile film. The cast of inmates are simply stunning to a man, and the situations they're given to act are no small potatoes. Jason Miller, who previously collaborated with Blatty on The Exorcist, is Lt. Reno, a man obsessed with adapting the work of Shakespeare for dogs, and Cutshaw's best friend among the other inmates. Robert Loggia's character, Bennish, is convinced he's on Venus and only needs his flying belt to get home. Fromme (played by Blatty himself) is convinced he's actually the camp medic, and keeps stealing Fell's pants. Et cetera. The staff aren't much less crazy than the inmates, and they, too, are perfectly cast. Just putting the ensemble together without a script and giving it free rein to improvise for two hours would make for a good movie. Blatty, however, takes things to another level with the conflict between Kane and Cutshaw, setting up a familiar love story plot (two people who need each other, but refuse to see it themselves) in a therapeutic setting. You never feel, however, that you're in the middle of a bad romance film, or even a buddy-cop picture. Both Keach and Wilson play their roles with more obvious intelligence than the actors in your average genre flick, and as a result, the audience never feels manipulated. In fact, the movie's big plot twists end up taking a back seat to the Kane/Cutshaw relationship; it's not that the revelations of the various mysteries Blatty sets up are any less startling than they are in a mystery film, but that the mysteries are simply stage decoration in Blatty's morality play.

Flawlessly executed, a perfect film in every way. Easily one of the hundred finest films ever made. Do not miss it. *****",1108944000,11,2874,4.788306451612903
765247,5,6304039565,"I've seen my share of films that have been good and bad. I've also seen movies that could similar to others. When it comes to The Ninth Configuration, I now know that there can be films that are original and don't borrow from other sources. This movie is not only one of a kind, it is also very moving and philosophical. If not dramatic with some twists and turns. Even the scene involving a bar room brawl between Stacy Keach and various actors playing vicious bikers (who literally get their tail-ends kicked brutally and fatally by Keach)was very original, if not unique.
The Ninth Configuration examines the after effects of the Vietnam War on various veterans who have suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome and other various traumas. It also examines the various themes of religion and why the world itself is going to hell in a handbasket. It also points out the old question that many have often asked. Is there a God? And if so, why does he let evil get away with various things?
A cult-classic like Blade Runner, with elements of witty black comedy that are almost like those from the movie M*A*S*H, The Ninth Configuration is a moving drama and excellent masterpiece. Not only does it have solid acting from the likes of Stacy Keach, Scott Wilson (who won a Golden Globe for his role in the film), Ed Flanders, Steve Sandor, Richard Lynch, the late Joe Spinell, Will Luckling, Robert Loggia, Jason Miller (as a soldier directing Shakespearean plays with Dogs, a very original and enjoyable plot element), Moses Gunn, and Tom Atkins, it also has some very interesting and powerful moments. Especially the surreal scene where a NASA astronaut discovers THE crucifix on the surface of the Moon.
If you enjoy films that are original and touches upon serious themes, like faith and religion, and state of humanity, then you are in for a surprise when you view The Ninth Configuration. It is a movie that still entertains many, and still keeps asking the same questions that man is still seeking the answers to.",1053993600,35,2022,4.763532763532764
765248,5,6304039565,"That's what Captain Cutshaw says to his psychiatrist. He continues:
"" Maybe you're P.T Barnum. . . He put a panther and a lamb in a cage together and there was never any trouble. The public went lollypops! Look at that! A panther and a lamb, and they don't even argue!. . .but what the public never knew was that it was never the same lamb. That (expletive deleted) panther ate a lamb every single day at intermission and then they shot him for asking for mint sauce. . . Animals are innocent, why should they suffer?. . . Why should children suffer? ""
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There's an in joke in Hollywood: You don't ask a director if he's seen "" The Ninth Configuration "", you ask how many times.
It's a cult classic. A supernatural horror film without anything seemingly frightening or supernatural, set in an insane assylum, set in a gothic castle. It's a mystery, a Christian martyr movie (no,I'm not kidding), an ensemble production of superb actors speaking some off THE best dialogue written, it's --it's-- Wiliam Peter Blatty!
Who, after writing ""The Exorcist"" (another easy 5 stars) put out a couple of lame ""sequels"" until he gathered enough clout to write and direct what he considered the TRUE sequel, which has nothing to do with little girls possesed by demons, but still everything to do with Good vs. Evil.
It's Vietnam and a number of officers have gone psycho--or are they faking it?  Due to the controversial nature of the war, it's being kept secret. At one of these bases--set in an abandoned castle in a remote forest, of course--top USMC psychiatrist, Colonel Kane (Stacey Keach) is sent to investigate.
Astronaut and head loon Captain Cutshaw (Scott Wilson) wonders if fellow officer/inmate Jason Miller (Father Karras in 'The Exorcist') may be right when he says "" I tell ya he's Gregory Peck in 'Spellbound', he's sent to take over the assylum but he's crazier than all of us! ""
For his part Kane is determined to help the men, especially their 'leader', Capt. Cutshaw.
The film focuses on the clash between these two bizarre and enigmatic characters.
Cutshaw: "" You're on your way out! I'm acting on orders so to inform you. ""
Kane: "" Who ordered you Cutshaw? ""
Cutshaw: "" Unseen forces far too numerous to enumerate.""
 Their psychotherapy slowly becomes a metaphor on the ancient debate of the impossibility of God, given the reality of evil. Brilliantly scripted by Blatty.

Kane: ""Perhaps we're all fish out of water...I mean if fish could survive, actually survive out of water, they'd all go crazy. Perhaps we're all meant for a much better place. ""
Cutshaw: ""You're so dumb you're adorable.""
Naturally, more than talk is needed. The action in the film is the turning point upon which the author/director hangs the plot twist as to who among them--and among us --is really crazy.
The answer might surprise you. An amazing film.",1050451200,59,2904,4.862626262626263

765250,5,6304039565,"A brilliant mixture of witty humor, gothic settings, enigmatic characters and theological debates about the existence - or nonexistence - of God combine to provide a rare insight into men experiencing the onset of madness after suffering the horrors of war.  Written, directed and produced by the author of 'The Exorcist', William Peter Blatty, 'The Ninth Configuration' is a challenging movie that not so surprisingly fails to make much sense to a first time viewer, though it makes a powerful impact on anyone who does see it.  Set during the time frame of the Vietnam War, Blatty deftly melds a variety of psychologically puzzling characters, supplying them with the most spellbinding and eminently quotable dialogue you are likely to ever hear in a film and placing them in an eerie castle in the Pacific northwest being used as a military asylum.  What follows is an undeniable cinematic masterpiece - densely macabre on the surface and slowly stripping away it's often shadowy foreboding layers until the incredible and shattering ending.  A film that inevitably defies any sense of classification, it can be viewed as a drama, a mystery, or a thriller, but in the final analysis it most appropriately fits the label of a theological thriller like it's predecessor 'The Exorcist'.
Simply put 'The Ninth Configuration' is a wow of a movie.  Everyone is superbly cast and gives an unforgettable performance, especially Stacy Keach and Scott Wilson.  There's never a dull moment after the credits run: we first see an astronaut abort his lunar launching mere seconds before take off, leading to his admission to the asylum; before a new psychologist arrives to assume command we are treated to a scene of the inmates gathering together in the castle grounds to welcome him and its here we are first introduced to them, their eccentricities and various states of mental condition; barely does the new head of the asylum get to his office before one of the inmates barges in, demanding to be evaluated for treatment, behaving quite bizarrely and sounding every bit like a lunatic.  But all is not as it appears as we soon find out.  Blatty proficiently weaves a deep mystery amidst the conversations the new asylum head has in various encounters with the inmates and also the Marine staff.  Sidesplitting one-liners, raving solicitations for help, demented delusions, fantastic irrational rants and heartfelt pleas for mercy and understanding ceaselessly intertwine one another resulting in a chaotic conundrum that will soon take it's toll on the asylum head.
Through the years following since it's initial release (1980) the running times have varied from as short as 99 minutes to a lengthy 140 minutes; reportedly some even rarer prints run as long as three hours!  Other running times still in circulation via countless video issues can vary between 109 - 119 minutes.  This DVD version is the latest preferred presentation by Blatty who provides some enlightening commentary that is beneficial to ardent fans and newcomers alike.  A Special Feature called ""Outtakes"" includes several deleted scenes that sheds some light onto sequences included in the final cut shown here, clearing up some quirky confusing dialogue; additionally there are two alternate endings within this area that subtlety change the film's ending.  A cult classic immediately upon release, 'The Ninth Configuration' is a movie that benefits from repeated viewings; I'm guessing you'll find that repeated viewings will be impossible to deny yourself - in fact you are likely to find it habit-forming!",1040169600,9,3578,5.16955017301038

Mr. Blatty should have known, as a professional writer, that this was the kind of self-indulgent stuff that should never have seen the outside of his wastebasket. My guess is that he had so much fun writing this piece that he made the mistake of thinking that meant it was good. It isn't.
It's very much like watching a Kevin Smith movie. The script is just the writer talking and talking and talking, knocking himself out with his own cleverness rather than trying to tell a story to an audience. The difference is that Kevin Smith occasionally is funny.
The performances are universally underpar. What you get to see is a bunch of actors being allowed to go with their first impulses in every scene. They haven't been directed at all. Poor Scott Wilson looks embarrassed at what he's being allowed to get away with. Every scene looks like a blooper. A painful thing to watch.

765344,5,6304039565,"Into an  old castle used as a political asylum by the U.S. government comes a new head shrink  (Stacy Keach) who may be crazier than the rest of the inmates...and who may be the infamous ""Killer Kane,"" responsible for a massacre in Vietnam. His presence proves to be disruptive...and oddly enlightening...to the assorted oddballs who populate the castle.
William Peter Blatty wrote and directed this eccentric adaptation of his own novel, ""Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane.""  Laced with clever, often comical dialogue and sometimes heavy-handed symbolism, the film proves to be as unusual as anything ever produced by Hollywood. The film's occasionally uneven pacing can make parts of it a chore to watch. But for those who persevere, the movie proves to be quite satisfying in the end. Keach gives a standout performance as new shrink; Blatty uses the actor's natural aloofness to emphasize the character's detachment from reality. All of the supporting characters are great; they're mostly brilliant men who either got in the way of the wrong people, or failed at a critical mission, or simply knew too much. Shut away from the world, they become emotionally and spiritually despondent, seeking anything to give their lives meaning...and to keep their fading sanity alive. One is trying to perform Shakespeare using an all-dog cast; another truly thinks he's Superman.
Yet despite their desperation, they're largely unnerved when Kane arrives, and rightly so, for he disrupts their existence in subtle ways...especially the doubting Captain Cutshaw...even as Kane's own sanity becomes questionable. The film has many standout moments, but the two most memorable have to be the amazing (and brutally violent) barroom fight, and the heavily symbolic ending, in which we have echoes of Michaelangelo's ""Pieta."" The film's ending may remind some of the finale to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and the two are indeed similar...but whereas Kesey was largely making a statement about the counterculture of the 60s (with a little religious symbolism thrown in), Blatty gives us a movie that is brutally honest about man's search for religious meaning, for God. The film isn't afraid to ask tough questions about faith and doubt. Like Kubrick, Blatty explores the theme of dehumanization; here, it is as a touchpoint for the film's more philosophical moments. Multiple viewings may be required to catch all of the symbolism and meaning within, but ultimately, it is worth the effort. A real underrated gem that's awaiting rediscovery...on DVD, perhaps? Fans of this may also like the powerful (but hard to find) Argentine film ""Man Facing Southeast."" It too, is replete with religious symbolism.",1008115200,6,2688,5.261072261072261

I would recommend  this film to anyone truly interested in a fine movie going experience.  Also see 'The Exorcist 3' by Blatty, featuring Flanders and Miller.",966211200,3,433,5.144927536231884
765413,5,6304039565,"Roger Ebert once said that Casablanca was the sort of movie that improves upon multiple viewings, because the first time we see it we're too involved in the plot, too concerned about what is happening and why; seeing the  movie again gives us the chance to appreciate the nuances. Those comments  certainly apply to The Ninth Configuration.
The plot is a good one, and  people who enjoy thrillers and mysteries will find enough action and plot  twists in the film to rival Hitchcock's best works. But what makes this  movie so special are the terrific performances (by Stacy Keach, Scott,  Wilson, and Ed Flanders), the witty dialogue,  and the religious  undercurrents. Too often movies treat religious belief with sentimentality  or scorn, but the Ninth Configuration deals with faith and doubt in with a  deftness and dignity that isn't patronizing to either side.
It's the  sort of movie that you immediately want to talk about with someone...which  could be difficult since so few people have seen it. Case in point: I host  a movie party every Thursday night. Every time a new member joins, I ask  him or her to compile a short list of movies that he or she has seen but  thinks others haven't but should. These lists serve as our guide for film  selections, and the attendees love movies and have broad tastes. But not  one of them had seen The Ninth Configuration. My father recommended it to  us, and we watched it last October, and thus far it remains the club's  hands-down favorite, beating out classics such as The Sting or The Lion in  Winter. Many of them have passed the title along to friends, who have also  enjoyed the newly discovered gem. And it has provoked hours of conversation  among us.
I can't think of a movie that would appeal so well to the  casual viewer, the mystery lover, the film buff, the occasion bible study  group for that matter.
Many movies are worth seeing. This one is worth  owning.",956448000,115,1926,4.6946107784431135
765414,5,6304039565,"I first encountered this movie in an obscure video rental shop inside my university campus 12 years ago. It was the title that intrigued me and i rented the tape because of it. I never expected it to be a subtle,  intellectual, philosophical movie of complex proportions (that is,coming  from Exorcist director William Peter Blatty). Being a die hard  existentialist, i deemed that the movie dealt with almost every salient  point existentialism is exploring - absudity, the meaninglessnes of life,  the questionable existence of God, the nature of 'goodness' and the need to  uphold one's 'meaning' and 'purpose' in a meaningless world.
Set in  mental institution, a group of 'mad' war veterans were housed as patients  exploring their own little wayward delusionary worlds. There was the hammer  armed patient wrecking a wall because its atoms won't let him pass, and  there was an ex-astronaut who suddenly had a dreadful phobia of space  because there's nothing out there - no God and no meaning. The protagonist  (played by Stacey Keach) was torn between his violent past and his  ruminitve nature and relentless effort of disciplining himself - what in  effect defines him as a human being in the context of being good or evil?
The morality play in the movie is tremendous exploring simultaneously  the nature of creation, the nature of man, the nature of insanity and the  nature and purpose of God. The title phrase - The Ninth Configuration, sums  it all up in an ironic, cerebral metaphor cast in the vast ocean of chance,  that is - It is easier to believe that life on earth arose from proteins  randomly forming patterns up to the 'Ninth Configuration' (despite the  large statistical improbabilty), than believing in a God. This scene was  played out in the movie as a dream sequence where-in astronauts were  digging something on the lunar soil and beside it eeirily was a crucifix w/  Christ's figure. The effect was surreal, suspended, displaced animation.
At the end of the story, however, the purpose and meaninglessness were  resolved, and that there is after all a pattern and an order in which  life's sufferings and travails were molded from.
This is a must see film  for people who likes to see a cut above run-of-the-mill films. A thinking  man's movie that arms him with a grain of thought we often take for granted  due to the orbits we mindlessly traverse - our existence and purpose in a  supposedly 'absurd' and 'ruthless' universe.",954201600,7,2462,4.907766990291262
765415,5,6304039565,"William Peter Blatty must surely be the most underappreciated artist of our time. The Ninth Configuration is a punch in the gut to the reductionist, cynical world.  This is crystalized in the moment when Scott Wilson's character considers the relative madness of Hamlet - truly, if he was crazy, or if the more extreme madness of all those around him made him seem to be.

In that hope, is our own. And if Killer Kane is worthy of salvation, perhaps we all are. What a beautiful, lyrical, important film.  Also wonderful performances from four actors sadly no longer with us: Ed Flanders, Alejandro Rey, Joe Spinnell and the great Jason Miller.",954115200,3,644,4.783783783783784

765418,4,6304039565,"Let me just say that, between this film and The Exorcist III, I have a feeling that the world may have been deprived of some absolutely amazing work due to studios unwilling to take a gamble on such a filmmaker as  Blatty.  Perhaps I'm way off base with this assumption, but all I know is  that William Peter Blatty is an extraordinary writer/director.  He has a  surrealistic approach to telling his stories, a style in which the audience  must pay attention in order to piece together the information.  Rather than  alienating the viewer, it allows him/her to become all the more absorbed in  the worlds Blatty creates.  He also has quite an extraordinary visual sense  that is all his own.  As I said, I can't help but think that Blatty has a  true masterpiece in him, one even better than The Ninth Configuration, if  only he would step behind a camera once again....",948499200,5,871,4.607843137254902

Yes you know the formula. But you do not know the whole story or the purpose of his presentation. It is not wasted on dogs. I now have a new insight to Hamlet.

At first this theological thriller seems ambit dated; with old cars and old music background. It may also appear a bit slow. However it is the interaction between Col. Vincent Kane (Stacy Keach) that is the movie not the filler.

This is the second of a Batty trilogy.
The Exorcist
The Ninth Configuration

For the people interested in the media of the movie, the Blue-ray really cleans up the film and adds a few extras. The extras include a voice over commentary.",1486857600,,851,4.470967741935484
