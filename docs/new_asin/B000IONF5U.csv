It won't play on any DVD player that is old enough to not be capable of playing burned disks.  I'm sure had I a chance to actually SEE this DVD, it would have been great. But unfortunately for me, until I go out and buy a brand new DVD player, that won't happen.",1213401600,3,351,4.072463768115942
8147122,1,B000IONF5U,"She spent a good quarter of the DVD on warm up and stretching.  Anyone at the Intermediate bodybuilding level has the sense to warm up before starting.  You couldn't fast forward the DVD either, just had to endure it.  Once she got lifting she kept up a fast pace.  I have been taught to use more control rather than momentum and to lift slowly up and down to get maximum work out of the muscle.  If you want a long stretch warm up and a fast lift, this is for you, otherwise get something geared to mens workouts.  You can always modifiy them for women, but they do a better job of getting serious.",1211932800,5,599,4.2105263157894735
8147123,5,B000IONF5U,"I haven't been working out for very long - about 3 months - and I've tried alot of different tapes, but this one is the best so far.  Francesca keeps you going the whole time, not needless time wasted talking.  She just keeps you working and motivated.  Of all the tapes I've tried, this is the best.  You'll enjoy the challange.",1194480000,4,329,4.344262295081967
