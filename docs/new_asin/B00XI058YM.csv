7167767,5,B00XI058YM,I have found the series very enjoyable. Their approach in proving or disproving various myths often with a bang or a boom let alone an explosion & using science in a comical way to teach the verious myths I can't help but enjoy & be educated. This also goes to the announcer who adds his take on the myths. I think his role is often overlooked & adds spice if it were to the show. Each adds to the show to make it a very terrific & educating show.,1438214400,2,447,4.033707865168539
