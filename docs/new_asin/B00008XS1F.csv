7988268,1,B00008XS1F,"I bought this based on great reviews and almost didn't make it through the first time around-it was 1 of the dullest workouts I've ever done and the Instructor was totally in motivating-almost seemed Robotic. I am an at home workout fanatic and have quite an extensive DVD collection. I enjoy doing Tracy Anderson,Tonique,Squeeze Stronger,Jessica Smith and many others-I found this workout mediocre and felt that I wasted my workout time doing it. Since purchasing it,I noticed that our Library has it-I wish I could have just borrowed it. As it is,I couldn't even sell it on EBay-wound up donating it",1428710400,,601,4.96039603960396

7988271,5,B00008XS1F,"I'm delighted to find this DVD, as my VCR finally died and I need this more than ever to improve my skiing.

Jennifer Kries is encouraging without being patronizing, and every exercise is explained thoroughly, with lots of reminders about form and breathing.  She demonstrates most of the movements and the students in the tape, who look anywhere from strong and svelte to pretty normal, always demonstrate variations for less strong or flexible practitioners.  Kries points out the differences early in each exercise so you're not waiting to hear the adjustments you'll make when starting out.  I really needed these because my core strength wasn't great at first.  In the way-back times I'd been a rockclimber and backpacker so I was naturally strong in my core, but had gotten completely out of shape except for long walks.

Let me tell you, I saw a difference almost immediately.  After two weeks of doing this tape twice a week I started to feel a significant difference in my flexibility and balance; after about 6 weeks I was able to do all the repetitions in the tape and had dropped a pants size just from improved muscle tone.  And the yoga and dance exercises also gave my upper torso and shoulders that nice graceful looking firmness and improved my posture immensely.

One thing that made this less intimidating is that Kries is shaped like me.  Although she's as toned and slender as you'd expect a Pilates instructor to be, her boxy pelvis is the same as mine.  A wide pelvis means you'll never look like a supermodel, who needs to be shaped more boyishly, and I appreciated having an instructor who looked like I did once my weight dropped and my strength was great.

Eventually I did take some Pilates mat classes, which I never would have tried if I hadn't learned the movements in Kries' program.  The instructor was great and the class more strenuous, but between classes I made time for Target Zones, and continued with Kries after I quit that gym.  I imagine an advanced Pilates student might not feel challenged, or might think there's too much yoga in Target Zones, but for a general, whole-body toning program it's a fantastic tape/DVD.",1297555200,6,2161,4.774193548387097
7988272,5,B00008XS1F,"works well, nice to look at, and she really explains why you're doing this and emphasizes breathing and form.  Great for beginners!",1238976000,2,131,4.954545454545454
7988273,5,B00008XS1F,"Although I mainly stick to Tae Bo and kickboxing, I also like to throw the occasional yoga and/or pilates workout into the mix for flexibility and strength.  I love Jennifer Kries as an instructor - she's always peppy and cheerful without becoming annoying, and she does a great job of explaining the poses in such a way that even yoga newbies like myself can easily understand.  Because I've enjoyed Kries's DVDs in the past, I chose The Method: Pilates Target Zones: Upper-Mid-Lower Body when I needed a dedicated abdominal routine.  As usual, Jennifer does not disappoint!

The workout is divided into three 25-minute segments: Abdominal/Centering, Lower Body/Grounding, and Balanced/Lengthening.  The segment titles are a bit misleading, however; the first two, Abdominal/Centering and Lower Body/Grounding, focus on the abdominals via a series of ""roll ups,"" while the last portion, Balanced/Lengthening, is an interesting mix of yoga and ballet.  The distinctions between Upper, Mid, and Lower Body aren't as discrete as the titles would have you believe.  Nonetheless, each segment is challenging and effective - I've noticed a definite improvement in my abdominal strength and overall flexibility since incorporating this DVD into my fitness program.

Abdominal/Centering, the first segment, begins with some breathing exercises, and then alternates between yogic stretching and increasingly difficult pilates ""roll ups"" that really (and I mean REALLY) challenge the abs.  Lower Body/Grounding is more of the same, but this series incorporates the use of a lightly weighted bar to assist in the standing stretches and give a point of focus in the ""roll ups.""  Even so, you don't have to run out and buy extra equipment in order to take full advantage of this workout - you can very easily substitute a broomstick or similar object for the bar (I use my Richard Simmons Ab Roller!).  Finally, the Balanced/Lengthening section leads you through various yogic postures, including the Sun Salutation, the Proud Warrior series, and Awkward Chair (this one really works your legs!).  Kries also includes a few ballet exercises, such as plis and ankle presses (again, great leg work!).

I have absolutely no complaints about this DVD - which is very rare for me!  The exercises are great, the instructor is engaging and encouraging, and the DVD format is suitable (i.e., each segment is its own chapter on the DVD, so you can easily customize your workout).  Upper-Mid-Lower Body is especially worthwhile for those looking to firm their tummies.  Along with Tae Bo: Billy's BootCamp: Ab BootCamp, this is my favorite ab workout.  And it shows - my six-pack is coming in quite nicely!",1132531200,27,2684,5.233644859813084
