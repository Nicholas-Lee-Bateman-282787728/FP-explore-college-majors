2608564,5,B000GG4XTW,"Tracy's Animated Crew, September 3, 2006
Reviewer: Bennet Pomerantz ""Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"" (Seabrook, Maryland) - See all my reviews
Chet Gould's classic comic strip Dick Tracy got a make over in the 1961 animated cartoon series.

Dick Tracy was the point man of this cartoon series. He assigned cases to his junior detective/comic sidekicks Joe Jitsu (a karate Charlie Chan wannabe) and Go-go Gomez (a speedy quick Mexican detective). Both sidekicksa are voiced by Mel Blanc (the voice of Bugs Bunny). These junior detectives  combat cases with classic rogues' gallery of Tracy's villains like Flattop, Itchy, Mumbles, Prune face, etc.

These so-called sidekicks were so much stereotypes. However this was theideal of most 1960's animation and cartoons. The aninmated  stereotypes were normal for TV at that time

The animation is good and crisply done for 1960 TV animation, unlike the 1960's Marvel moving pictures or filmation stuff with DC heroes (with Superman, Batman ,etc). It is fair in animated standards, not just lips moving like Clutch Cargo. It was UPI Studios who also did Mr Magoo cartoons, so there was a sense of quality to it. In my opinion, It fared better than most of today's stuff tv animation has to offer other than Hanna Barbara animation , which to me was and is the gold standard of cartoon excellence. I think Ed, Edd and Eddie for an example of the worse of today's animated stuff. This  DVD has no extra features, just good clean family fun. It is worth getting for a keepsake of great 1960's animation.

However if you want good animated TV Tracy adventures, I am holding out and waiting for TV Funnies with eight minute Tracy Episodes (which are unavailable for DVD at this time). Until then, this will have to do for my TRACY fix.

2608574,4,B000GG4XTW,"THE DICK TRACY SHOW-COMPLETE SET: Made for TV cartoons of the sixties utilized ""limited animation"", a money saving technique pioneered by UPA and HANNA BARBERA, whose programs depended greatly on voice characterizations to carry the story. Adapted oh so loosely from CHESTER GOULD's popular comic strip, THE DICK TRACY SHOW was played for laughs, with its lantern jawed detective (character actor EVERETT SLOAN) mostly outsourcing crime capers from behind a desk. His team of bungling gumshoes consisted of CARY GRANT-channeling bulldog HEMLOCK HOLMES, the CHARLIE CHAN clone JOE JITSU, GO GO GOMEZ (MEL BLANC doing a less hyper variation of his SPEEDY GONZALES) and apple filching beat cop HEAP O' CALLORY (think ANDY DEVINE). GOULD's grotesque gallery of villains, here given personalities patterned after famous film baddies, included BB EYES (EDWARD G. ROBINSON), FLAT TOP (PETER LORRE) and THE BROW (JAMES CAGNEY), who proved as inept as their captors. Each five minute 'toon featured a brief ""Crimestopper Tip"", most of which now seem hilariously dated...unlike TRACY's ultra-cool two way wrist radio, the ""cell phone"" of its era. ""Six, two and even...over and out!""

2608577,4,B000GG4XTW,"Here in Chicago these cartoons were shown after school (4:30 PM) on WGN TV, Channel 9 on a show that went by the same name as the cartoons.  It featured WGN's multi-hat wearing personality Ray Rayner as Sargent Pettibone in a police station setting, with his side kick Tracer the dog.  Ray showed these cartoons along with another called QT Hush.

It's a big difference between sitting down and watching these quickly viewed cartoons back to back on DVD versus one or two between conversation, commercials and other happenings on a TV show like Ray had.  Too bad Sony did not include (despite what the information on the back said) the Crime Stopper Information edited in between say every four or five cartoons.  I'm taking away a star for Sony listing the segments but not including them.

I have a bootleg of the series that has the crime stopper material plus a great commercial for the Dick Tracy remote controlled cop mobile from one of the great toy companies of the day, IDEAL. I think the CSI segments are a good model for police/community relations for young children.  If you are curious about the CSI segments, here's a summary.  They are presented by Tracy and focus on a particular topic. For example, there is one that shows how communications between the station and patrol officers in the field are carried out.  Another explains how finger prints are gathered and clues recovered from the scene of the crime and another that explains the role of a police officer.

The artwork is harsher looking than the cartoons.  There is little if any animation and mostly just illustrative drawings that shows police officers (male & female)and bad guys in a setting (police station, bank, city street etc.)supporting the topic.  The CSI is very interesting and informative even if some of the technology used in the illustrations are long outdated.  Even so it's nice for young children to be able to compare the technology and equipment from then to today.  Amongst the tips dispursed are some common sense items like keeping crooks out by simply making sure doors and windows are locked.  Young boys and girls are even urged to consider a career in law enforcement. As interesting and informative as these are, I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that young children who already saw police work as interesting, also found these bits of information as a source of inspiration.  The CSI run less than a minute and then it is ""on to our next cartoon.""

I like The Dick Tracy Show cartoons with it's interesting villains and odd good guys.  The show takes me back to the days of coming home from school and watchng kids TV programs.",1360195200,2,2641,4.741794310722101

2608579,1,B000GG4XTW,"If you have never seen this show before and like to collect cartoons I suggest going and getting the first disc for 96 cents at Walmart.  This show is horrible, it rarely has Dick Tracy in it, basically he just tells this dog to go get the criminal and then at the end the dog tells him he got the criminal.  The bonus, at least on the first disc, is just Dick Tracy giving useless service announcements, I think that is what they'd be called.  What I don't understand is if this is a Dick Tracy cartoon why isn't it about Dick Tracy.  It has the criminals so it should have been called 'the villains of Dick Tracy'.  Also, the gags are done over and over and the first time they weren't funny.

2608582,3,B000GG4XTW,"Chester Gould's comic strip creation, police detective Dick Tracy was adapted for the animated television program The Dick Tracy Show (1960-61) which ran for one season.  An impressive total of 130, five minute episodes were produced, however they do not reflect the more serious tone or style of the comics, where Tracy took a more frontline role in the solving of crimes.

In the cartoon, each episode opens with Tracy at police headquarters, receiving a phone call reporting some crime or problem.  Tracy then calls one of his detectives in the field using his wrist radio, and assigns them the case.  Tracy's detectives include, Joe Jitsu, Hemlock Holmes and the Retouchables, Heap O'Callory, and ""Go Go"" Gomez.  Tracy usually leaves headquarters to help his detective wrap up the case.

In regards to Tracy's detectives, humor based on ethnic stereotypes is a major component, particularly in the case of Joe Jitsu and Go Go Gomez.  Jitsu, is Japanese, speaks in broken English, has protruding front teeth, wears glasses, and is a martial arts expert, while Gomez is Hispanic, wears a large sombrero, is frequently shown relaxing, and is often reminded by Tracy to get on the job.  Hemlock Holmes is a talking bulldog, apparently British, who has a voice like Cary Grant, while Heap O'Callory is an overweight Irish beat cop, in the habit of lifting goods from fruit stands.

Looking back now, it's obvious that the cartoon heavily incorporated ethnic stereotypes, which would not be viewed as racially sensitive today.  Regrettably, this was fairly common practice back in the early 1960's.  Later, when The Dick Tracy Show was in syndication, it was taken off the air in many markets for being potentially offensive.  While it's possible for an adult to try and make some allowance for the stereotyping, and view the program with some kind of perspective, The Dick Tracy Show probably isn't something that you would want to show to impressionable young children, who do not have the ability to filter what they are viewing.

The colorful and distinctive villains are one of the most entertaining elements in the cartoon.  Typically working in pairs, they include BB Eyes and his partner FlatTop (17 episodes), Prune Face and Itchy (23 episodes), The Brow and his buddy Oodles (24 episodes), Sketch Paree and The Mole (21 episodes), and Stooge Viller and his amusing pal Mumbles (32 episodes).  Cheater Gunsmoke makes two appearances, and several of the criminals are involved in assorted solo adventures.  All together, the villains are a rather unsavory lot, usually prone to violence and gunplay, while Tracy's detectives typically rely on other methods to gain the upper hand.

When it comes to the stories themselves, they tend to be rather formulaic and kind of similar, depending on the particular detective handling the case.  With only about four minutes to work with, it takes some real creativity to avoid falling into a rut, and the writing is often up to the challenge, and actually seems to improve as the season progresses, as additional writers are involved, and many adventures take place outside of America.  Hemlock Holmes appears in 45 episodes, Joe Jitsu 43, and Heap O'Callory just 9, before being phased out of the series.  Go Go Gomez doesn't make an appearance until Episode 52, but finishes strongly, appearing in 35 episodes.

The four discs in the set are housed in a very attractive book type case.  The Image quality of the cartoons is very good, as the source material seems to have been pretty well preserved.  The style of animation is actually quite good, and the music is also quite lively.  Because of the nature of the program, the appeal of The Dick Tracy Show today might be limited to dedicated Tracy fans, or those with nostalgia for 60's cartoons, for whom the ethnic based humor of the program may not come as a complete surprise.",1332633600,5,3879,4.950617283950617
2608583,5,B000GG4XTW,"Although these cartoons are most likely politically incorrect, I shill like them, I used to watch them when I was a kid.  I knew other kids my age that watched them, some from other ethnic groups, I never heard a bad thing about them.  Enough of that stuff, I love these cartoons.  Thank You.

2608584,4,B000GG4XTW,"I had totally forgotten that signature call sign, but it jumped out at me in a brain flash as soon as Tracy signed off his two-way wrist radio in this classic(???), offbeat cartoon series.
Being nearly 50 years since I had seen any of this foolishness, what did I remember before viewing the dvds?
1). That I didn't like this show very much, especially the talking dog and his Keystone Kops team. Even as a kid I wanted a more serious show.
2). That Tracy appeared only at the beginning and end of each cartoon, dispatching some cartoon cronie to do the field work.
3). That Tracy said at the beginning of each show, "" Ok Chief, I'll get on it right away.""
4). That Go-Go Gomez and Joe Jitsu were regulars, rounding up Tracy villains such as Flat Top, The Brow, Mumbles, The Mole, Pruneface and others.

After viewing more than my fair share of THE DICK TRACY SHOW, I will say that this show is not very funny. I didn't laugh a whole lot. But I did find myself thinking that these cartoons weren't too bad, at least not as bad as I thought they were going to be. I liked the modernist look and especially the opening credits as the squad car speeds along. And there's an abundance of well-timed quips from heroes and villains alike. Even the dog character, Hemlock Holmes, didn't really bother me now, and he and his Retouchables squad provided the funniest cartoons of the set, though that may be stretching it a bit.
The one character that I had completely forgotten was the Andy Devine take-off, Heap O'Calory, but it all came back to me when he got his tips from the bongo playing beatnik, Nick.

This is really a great set for what you get: 4 dvds containing all the TRACY cartoons ever made and a nice comic book! But it's hard to get through any more than a half dozen of these cartoons in one sitting, and although they're quick paced and contain some zippy one-liners, they're really not all that funny and are best enjoyed for nostalgic purposes only.",1318896000,,1961,4.444444444444445
2608585,1,B000GG4XTW,"Dick Tracy was too good a property to miss with show-biz; it missed.  Only the Fleischer brothers in their Superman mode could have done it justice; instead the once fruitful UPA firm, now dying from limited animation, did its best to ape the dread King Features Popeyes for television, and succeeded.  (The former Disney man Dick Kinney worked both projects).  One doubts UPA ever took Chester Gould's strip seriously; it aimed for a spurious comic angle and homeopathically diluted his creation into a witless, offensive mishmash.  No TV producing team ever had more of an obsession with the lamest running gags and the most idiotic non-sequiturs.  Perhaps the apex of nonsense is ""Lab Grab"", where The Brow and Oodles gulp down gallons of Tang-colored potions to make themselves invisible.  You must see it to believe it for its sheer stupidity.  Yes the ethnic stereotypes are b-a-d but I submit the third-rate Cary Grant impersonation Hemlock Holmes is the single most annoying character in animation history, with the white male Heap O'Callory not far behind.  Only the uncredited Everett Sloane as Tracy does himself good; happily he's largely a bystander to this assault on the senses.

Sony did its part by omitting the Crimestopper Tips mentioned on the back cover (not that they would have helped) and indulging in some clever misspellings in the menus, like ""Pearl Theif Grief"" and ""Esacpe from Sing Song"" (SIC!).  Stop in the name of the law!",1295740800,3,1455,5.0
2608586,5,B000GG4XTW,"With over 100 short episodes contained in this DVD collection obviously I'm not going to even attempt to review much of the episodes. I bought this DVD set because like others have mentioned I also liked this show when I was younger. I saw the cartoons for the first time in the early 1990's...and I believe it was in 1990 and 1991 right around the time the Warren Beatty DICK TRACY movie was a big hit. Anyway...I liked what I saw and never seen the cartoons again after the channel took them off the air once the movie's popularity started to die down. So, when I saw this DVD available I bought it. I've watched all 4 of the DVD's and I often rotate between DVD #3 and #1 more than I do #2 and #4 but they're all good.

One disc is devoted almost entirely to adventures featuring Joe Jitsu while another has a majority of Go-Go Gomez adventures. Heap O'Callory isn't featured nearly as much while Hemlock Holmes is confined mostly to the first and second disc. In one of the episodes Hemlock Holmes and the Retouchables have to be rescued by Joe Jitsu...marking one of the rare moments where two of Tracy's underlings are featured in the same episode. The Retouchables are a spoof of The Untouchables but with a comedic twist inspired by the Keystone Cops. One of the running gags is how the Retouchables can never remember their orders. For example: suppose there's a robbery at a shoe store on piper street. Well, the Retouchables in unison would mangle their orders by saying something like ""there's a pipe robbery at a shoe story"" and another may 'correct' that description by saying ""no, there's a pipe store being robbed on shoe street"", etc. etc.

In almost every instance they take off in their car, filled with the brim and full of excitement, totally forgetting about their leader, Hemlock Holmes, who is always seen chasing the car with his arms flailing around hollering for them to stop.

Most people perhaps don't know that pretty much all of the villains and the underlings who worked for Tracy had voices based on celebrities, both fictional and non-fictional, of the time period. Paul Frees often provided the voice for Flat-Top and Go-Go Gomez but the characters were also voiced infrequently by Mel Blanc but it was Frees who handled most of the episodes with those specific characters. Benny Rubin, a veteran actor from vaudeville and radio with a long run on Jack Benny's program, provided the voice of Joe Jitsu.

Flat-Top's voice is patterned after Peter Lorre; Joe Jitsu's voice is patterned after Charlie Chan; B.B. Eyes has a voice similar to Edward G Robinson; Brow's voice is patterned after James Cagney; Prune Face's voice is patterned after Boris Karloff to some extent; Itchy's voice can be interpreted as an exaggeration on Joe Besser; Hemlock Holmes' voice, of course, is patterned after Cary Grant; Heap O'Callory's voice is based on Andy Devine; Stooge Villar's voice is a run of the mill ""tough guy"" one may hear on old-time radio's Damon Runyon Theatre. Oodle's voice is the stereotypical dumb guy voice while The Mole has a voice which makes one feel as if the character has dirt stuffed up his nose from all the digging that he does. Sketch Paree has the debonair suave voice patterned after stereotypical French villains. The most bizarre voice, of course, is the one from Mumbles.

I found the cartoons to be completely entertaining...I loved them as a kid/teenager in the early '90s but seeing that I'm a bit older now I get the biggest kick out of the vocal work and the culture references. The banter between Prune Face and Itchy is hilarious as well. ""Itchy, STOP that scratching!!"" is something of a catchphrase. Another recurring feature is the ""HALT!!"" scene where the cop on patrol can freeze time, typically at a crucial part of the story, in order to call in to Tracy with an update. After the phrase ""six-two and even, over and...out!"" is said the action resumes.

Each short cartoon features almost the exact same opening scene...with Tracy at his desk wrapping up a conversation with his boss and then alerting one of his underlings via the wrist watch radio what the next assignment is going to be. This is a great collection of Dick Tracy cartoons.",1289001600,2,4208,4.718367346938775
2608587,5,B000GG4XTW,"These cartoons are great fun. Our family really enjoys the cartoons from the 1940's thru the 1980's. The characters and their descriptive names make these cartoons alot of fun. However since they were made so long ago, they may not be exactly considered to be politically correct. There are some stereotypical characters that are still entertaining, but might make some overly sensitive people uneasy. For that reason I would recommend that the be enjoyed by older children and adults.",1257724800,4,485,5.151898734177215
2608588,1,B000GG4XTW,"I will preface this review by stating that I am a big fan of cartoons. Everything from Disney animated movies to the old Hanna-Barbera yogi Bear cartoons and everything in between... as long as there is something of value in it.  By that I mean humor, excitement, talented voices, good animation.... or any combination of those things.  SOMETHING of value.  I will also mention that I love the character of Dick Tracy that Chester Gould created.  The old Chester Gould comic strips are wonderful.  Now, as for These Dick Tracy Show cartoons.... they are absolute garbage. Forget about it. Unfunny, uninteresting, unexciting, boring... not even worth purchasing just for nostalgia's sake. I honestly don't understand how this show existed for 130 episodes.  It must have been purely on the Dick Tracy name recognition alone.  Now, I remember seeing re-run episodes of this show when I was very young, and I seem to recall enjoying them then.  But I was VERY young. I doubt that these cartoons could hold even a ten year old child's interest for a full five minutes today.  It's really amazing how weak they are.  Although the character animations of the criminals, from Flat Top to Itchy to BB-eyes, Prune Face, the whole fanciful gang of them... are fairly well represented, these criminals in the cartoon show are absolute idiots, unlike Chester Gould's original characters. Dick Tracy himself rarely appears in any of the episodes, except at the last 15 or 20 seconds to scoop up the criminals who have been nabbed by his ""junior"" detective squad of dull uninteresting profiles. These helpers include Heap O'callory, a fat ( Heap -o- calorie... ha ha...) uniformed officer who is so inept he has no buisness being anywhere near a police uniform. Hemlock Holmes , a talking bulldog in an inflatable policeman's hat, who teams up with a keystone-cops type of motley crew of idiotic officers called the Retouchables ( a weak satirical bow to the Untouchables ). A Hispanic officer called GO-GO Gomez from south of the border, an absolute abomination of a character who lathers up the stereotype of every bigoted view of mexicans. And Joe Jitsu a Japanese detective who actually is shown to have some intelligence, has some humorous lines once in a while, but ultimately is not nearly enough to carry the show. I found only one thing of value in purchasing this set of DVD's.  The set comes with a comic book reprint of Chester Gould's original Dick Tracy comic strips, about 30 pages worth.  It's great. BUT, a paper comic book reprint of Dick Tracy strips is not worth the price of buying this set of DVD's.  I watched three of the four disks, somehow managing not to pluck my eyes out and stomp on them out of sheer boredom, but I knew if I watched any more of this that I would end up in a  straight jacket,so I skipped the last disk simply for sake of preserving my sanity. As you can probably see , from my review, I can not recommend purchasing this set.

However, I was very pleased to see all the episodes intact, including full begin themes, (unlike the disappointing releases of Batfink without its begin song).

Fortunately I found a ""fell off the truck"" copy on eBay for less than half price, because upon playing the first disc I realized that these are pretty much for kids only. Aside from a few adult references (such as using a Peter Lorre-like voice for Flattop) these are not very clever, and definitely do not hold up as adult entertainment by any stretch of the imagination. I guess I was fooled by my own enjoyment of many great reprints of the original Tracy strip (which I see is now coming out in new editions ~ look elsewhere on Amazon) but after 3 of these cartoons I knew I was going to be trading this one in at Coconuts.

Even though I don,t see the crimestopper tips the cartoons are still good as can be.",1160784000,5,350,4.014285714285714
2608592,4,B000GG4XTW,"When I saw this DVD set, I just had to pick it up for nostalgia sake.  One reviewer was a bit harsh but admitted that they did not see the show when originally aired in the 60's.  What's the saying?  Sometimes you ""just had to be there"" in order to find appeal in DVD releases of old TV shows such as this.  As is often the case it is far more about simple nostalgia and fond recollections than perceived quality.

As a kid in the 60's, the ""Dick Tracy Show"" was a favorite and after popping in the first disc and seeing that high overhead street scene with the traffic parting and that music...a flood of memories came back.  Of course looking at it now with my adult eye it was pretty cheesy stuff.  I had totally forgotten that Dick Tracy doesn't really do anything other than hand off the assignments in the opening scene and check in at the end.  I wonder why?  Is it that Tracy was drawn too seriously and wasn't meant to be funny and therefore let his cartoon-like ""crime-busting pals"" take over?  Funny, as an adult, and why I would even notice such things, I found myself picking up mistakes, errors or things that don't make sense.  Geez, it's a cartoon, but I noticed that there is no nameplate on Tracy's desk when facing him but with the angle from behind it suddenly appears...and the nameplate is facing him!  Things like this only add to the appeal.  OK, this is sad.  What's next?  I'm going to notice Deputy Dog and Yogi Bear don't have pants on...or the fact that they talk?

Anyway, though I am not sure I can sit through all 130 episodes, it is a hoot to catch up with ol' Mumbles, Flattop and Pruneface as well as GoGo Gomez, Joe Jitsu and of course, Heap O'Callory!  Get it?  A rather plump cop named ""Heap O'Callory"".  It went over my head as a kid and I just made the connection watching it as an adult.

Good fun if you grew up watching this show or if you have young kids in the house.  For me, since the entire series is on one attractively priced DVD set, it was an easy choice.",1160524800,31,2007,4.256613756613756

The back cover says it includes Tracy's CRIME STOPPER TIPS (The short inbetween segments from the original show) BUT unless they are a REALLY well hidden EASTER EGG, I haven't been able to find them.  Other than that, I am glad this set was released Un-Censored!",1160092800,11,400,4.605633802816901
2608594,4,B000GG4XTW,"At last on DVD, here are all 130 UPA five minute cartoons. Hailing from 1961, this series was created with Dick Tracy creator, Chester Gould as consultant. However, it's a very light, slapstick-style cartoon with the modernistic, minimal look UPA was known for. In the late '50s- early '60s this was all the rage, as animators tried to find limited animation techniques to fit TV's limited budgets. At the same time, they had to compete with stock theatrical cartoons making their way to the small screen, which had lavish studio facilities and bottomless wallets.

Hanna-Barbera would be the winner in the TV sweeps, offsetting limited animation techniques like characters running past the same tree or barber pole again and again and reusing heads and bodies by animating in layers (cels), with sparkling dialogue, top notch voice actors, whimsical character design, bold graphic style and a new paintbox of bright colors.

UPA is better-known for Mr. Magoo, whom UPA successfully transferred from award-winning theatrical cartoons to a number of TV series (which have yet to make DVD). Shown initially in syndication and later as The Dick Tracy Show, this UPA series was extremely popular. Tracy has an office job in this show, merely dispatching jobs to his team of crime fighters: Joe Jitsu, Go Go Gomez and Hemlock Holmes (a British bulldog). They may be considered stereotypes by some viewers, but the idea was to pit diverse and exaggerated good guys against the outlandish bad guys who people Gould's comics. Usually cartoons took these ideas straight across from the movies. Joe Jitsu is part crime-solver par excellence Mr. Moto, and incorporates the then-current rage for ju-jitsu. The Retouchables, the theme music cues us, recall the Keystone Kops. Rather than the dark tone of Gould's strip, however, the series has the light, slapstick tone echoing kids' TV of the time.

The packaging is an attractive album which opens to reveal four one-sides discs. Mine came packaged with a free 64 page black and white comic of Gould's first three Dick Tracy adventures (which have nothing in common with the cartoon) advertising the plan to reprint Gould's entire comic series. That may be a limited-time premium. At any rate, here's UPA's first entry on DVD; let's hope Mr. Magoo isn't far behind.",1159488000,31,2304,5.073878627968337
8131627,5,B000GG4XTW,"It takes me way back when as a young lad I loved this cartoon, and I had to buy this because it's part of my early years. Now as I watch them it's like walking down memory lane. Courageous cat and minute mouse too. As a collector I like the hunt. Sure cartoons are corny, but when you see what's on tv now, well I'll take corny anytime!",1526428800,,336,3.9558823529411766
8131628,4,B000GG4XTW,"Nice set of DVD's, nicely packaged and presented.  I took a star off because the audio seems to be uneven from episode to episode-not terribly so, but I did notice it.  I love these old cartoons, and I love Dick Tracy so I think these are great.  I can understand how some see them as boring, but I don't.  I don't think the creativity and cleverness is anywhere near, say, that of Rocky and Bullwinkle, but The Dick Tracy Show is colorful, fun, and I am happy to have the whole collection.  There is something about the simple animation and abstract art of these old 'toons that is really magical.",1515628800,,598,4.4

8131632,5,B000GG4XTW,"In spite of the fact that these cartoons are now politically incorrect and they may be considered to have stereotyped some races and nationalities, I enjoyed these cartoons.  I don't think that they meant to cast aspersions on anyone.  I enjoyed them and still do.  It's funny that Dick Tracy really did nothing in the cartoons except to put one of his squad on the case.",1492905600,,371,4.590909090909091
