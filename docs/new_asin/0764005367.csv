7788409,5,0764005367,"I was so excited to buy this video! As a younger fan of That Girl, this was a great opprotunity for me to have owning this tape. I was born twelve years after the show was off the air, but I'm a huge fam of Marlo Thomas and I wanted more episodes of That Girl to watch after TVLand took it off hte air too. I was heartbroken when this happened.  When I saw that these tapes were for sale, I immediatley bought them. I now have the complete two box sets of tapes. They r the best! I suggest you try them for yourself!! Have Fun! Always remember that Diamonds, Daisies, and Snowlfakes and a little That Girl is all you'll need.",985651200,4,625,4.08130081300813
7788410,5,0764005367,"So what if the 2nd episode on this tape is not the one described on the box! It's still our beloved Marlo! All 3 episodes on this tape are great as they are on the other 2 tapes. Watching any ""That Girl"" episode  is such a refreshing break from the realities of today. Ann Marie  represents all of the good things in life that seem to have fallen by the  wayside. Thank you Anchor Bay for bringing ""That Girl"" back into  my life!",932774400,4,429,4.132530120481928
7788411,3,0764005367,"This video, entitled 'Guest Stars' is one of three in a new gift set.  There are nine terrific episodes from the first season and up to 1971.  All of them are great reminders of what we found fun and sophisticated in the  New York City of the 1960's. Marlo Thomas wears fabulous designer clothes  and super hair.  Good fun! The only disappointment (and this may not be  known to Anchor Bay Entertainment) is that the advertised episode with  Ethel Merman entitled, 'Pass The Potatoes, Ethel Merman' on 'Guest Stars'  is not on this video or on any of the other videos in this set.  Ethel  Merman is NOT in the second episode as described.  It does have Ann Marie  at an audition but Ethel Merman is nowhere to be found.  After viewing all  nine episodes, the Merm does not appear anywhere.  The description on the  video box reads ""Episode two finds Ann overwhelmed to be appearing in  a walk-on part on stage with Ethel Merman.  After being tongue-tied and  applauding inappropriately the first-day of rehearsals, Ann avoids Miss  Merman in embarrassment.  Donald, trying to be helpful, invites the star to  dinner at Ann's apartment, where her presence attracts the attention of all  the neighbors.""  Over the seasons, there were two 'That Girl'  episodes with the Merm. These are classic and I purchased this set in order  to have a permanent record of at least one of them.  Perhaps Anchor Bay  Entertainment can advise how they will rectify this unfortunate situation.  To all Ethel Merman fans -- avoid this video until the appropriate changes  are made.  To all 'That Girl' fans -- run, do not walk -- to pick up this  great video set.",926121600,12,1642,4.692579505300353
