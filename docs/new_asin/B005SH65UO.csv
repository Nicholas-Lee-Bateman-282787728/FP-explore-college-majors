4883808,4,B005SH65UO,"Thank you Thank you THANK YOU!

I am SO GLAD to see this original U.K. version, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, is being released! As a major aficionado of all things Arctic and Antarctic, I SO BADLY wanted to watch this as it originally aired on the Discovery Channel. Alas, I could not endure more than a few minutes of that insufferable, blowhard, windbag Alec Baldwin's pretentious narration. It just made the whole thing seem silly and really ruined what would otherwise have been a film experience of flawless quality. So I forewent the experience.

Now I see that there is such a thing as justice and will be able to enjoy the series after all!

Thank You to the filmmakers for correcting their mistake! I will buy the DVD set and I will breathe countless sighs of relief every time I watch!",1334620800,9,802,4.594405594405594
4883809,5,B005SH65UO,"I cannot understand why some people are being so analy retentive as to cry, ""Wolf!""  Just because some of the sequences were filmed in a zoo, or a studio, or a 'controlled environment.'
The series itself is visually stunning, & makes many valid points: not least that life in those harshest of climes is life on the very edge of existence.
What was filmed in the Arctic & Antarctic was television at its best.  The fact that not everything of the story could be filmed in those places, but had to be filmed elsewhere in conditions that best ensured the safety & survival of the subjects & the camera crew, only completed the picture.
It took nothing away from the reality, only adding to it by filling in the blanks; & had the programme been halted midway through a sequence, just to say that the next bit was filmed in a zoo - the magic of the moment is lost - the continuity is broken.
Nothing was done to intentionally deceive, not unless you're into extreme cynicism & conspiracy theories that is.
Did those people know that the dinosaurs in otherwise 'factual' TV series, weren't filmed in real life?  They were nothing more than the (best guess) imaginings of scientists, palaeontologists & CGI?

4883810,5,B005SH65UO,"Part 3 of second CD, called The Last Frontier is very educational and beautifully done. I had to watch it twice with a laptop next to me so I could do the search for all the places that they were talking about to see the exact geographical locations. I think it's critical for human creation to accept the responsibility not to disturb the animals we encounter, and to encourage everyone to respect and protect the natural world. What a privilege it is to see wild animals undisturbed in their natural environments and no one accomplishes that like the crew of BBC and the talented, dedicated and educated David Attenborough... I wish David lots of health since he truly is indispensable... No better way of watching a nature documentary than having David as the narrator with his own unique accent and personality. All the UK versions are with David but producers change the narrators for some countries but regardless the PLANET producers, a BBC production is the one when comes to cinematography, quality new shots, locations and education... Simply Bravo.

4883811,4,B005SH65UO,"Below find an opinion of a reader of the Telegraph in the UK who watched the series. I agreed that BBC should disclose that part of the series was done in a zoo. When I take pictures of animals in the zoo I always mention the fact the animal was in captivity. It is the same animal that you can see in the wild but out of its natural habitat. This is a big difference for the photographer (easy to make good shots) and for the animal (relax and behaving different as it would be in the wild).

charlescawley from The Telegraph.com.uk
12/14/2011 09:14 PM

I was lied to because the programme did not state that a part of its report was done in a Zoo.  There was nothing said to indicate that the footage had been deliberately made to look like 'as if'.

This is called manipulation.

Had the BBC indicated in the credits that certain part had been deliberately created 'as if' then all would have been well.  But it did not except well away in another context.

It was deliberate manipulation... adjustment of facts to suit the programme makers and to make a good story.

Jackholt, you would not like to be manipulated, or perhaps you would?  It is a dangerous attitude not to tell people and leave them to be deceived into thinking footage is genuine rather than constructed to pretend.

Yes it is about a life cycle, not of a particular animal, but it purported to be of the life cycle of bears in the Frozen Wastes, not partly in a Zoo.",1324080000,11,1438,4.352059925093633

4883813,4,B005SH65UO,"This review is based on the UK Blu-Ray release and, so far, based on what I've read, the US release will be identical (as with Human Planet). Unfortunately, once again, Discovery seems to be planning to air their own butchered version, this time replacing David Attenborough with Alec Baldwin. I'm sure I don't have to recommend to most of you to seek out Attenborough's version.

This is the latest flagship release of the BBC's Natural History Unit, the next in line in the epic 'Planet' series after Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Life, and Human Planet. It was produced by Alastair Fothergill, executive producer of Planet Earth, and shares several similarities with that release in terms of structure and approach.

David Attenborough not only narrates this one in superb, warm and energetic form, but even makes a couple of appearances in the harsh Antarctic locations at the age of 85! The writing seems to be a collaborative effort however, and is somewhat chaotic.

This seven-part seven-hour series covers the natural and wild habitat of the Arctic and Antarctic circles, covering indigenous life, their survival tactics, hunts, and mating cycles, as well as the landscape and natural events, most of which involve ice in dozens of surprising forms, and the extensive effects of the seasonal cycle. The first episode is a kind of overview, four more episodes cover these habitats during the four seasons, the sixth episode covers various human explorations, studies and residents of these regions, and the final controversial episode covers melting ice and global climate change.

I recently re-watched Attenborough's Life in the Freezer (also produced by Fothergill) in preparation for this series, figuring that this would cover much of the same ground and would probably be a remake/upgrade (as with Planet Earth). Unfortunately, I guessed correctly, but this series adds the following:

- Arctic footage (Life in the Freezer only covered Antarctica). But even this footage is not always fresh, having seen polar bears, arctic wolves and other Arctic animals in many previous releases such as Planet Earth and Life.

- Breathtaking landscape footage in high definition. You've never seen so much ice and snow take on so many forms and do so many awe-inspiring things.

- Upgraded footage in high definition. A lot of the Antarctica footage covers the same ground as Life in the Freezer, except this time they use the latest technology and go the extra mile (or hundred miles) to create the perfect shot.

That said, I felt that Life in the Freezer, in its mere 3 hours running time, educated me better and more systematically. Although Attenborough gives us a wealth of facts and knowledge on this release, the overall writing and structure is lacking. This is mainly due to the chaotic and whimsical structure similar to Planet Earth that splices together any spectacular footage it could find regardless of its educational value. Categorizing the footage under which season it happened in is simply not enough guys.

Let's illustrate this with a specific example: In Life in the Freezer, Attenborough discussed and showed us lichens to complete the picture of life on Antarctica. But, evidently on this release, lichens were deemed too boring and they were replaced with yet another bloody and action-packed hunt instead.

Other details:
- The quality of the picture and sound is top-notch as expected.
- The first overview episode doesn't repeat the same footage used in later episodes as they did with Life/Planet Earth, but cuts out footage from several scenes in upcoming episodes instead to provide a random selection of upcoming attractions. So it is not as repetitively annoying, but it is still the wrong thing to do in my opinion.
- As on previous releases, each episode ends with 10-minute behind the scenes footage. Except this time, some of the scenes that are covered aren't on the episode we just watched, which is a bit weird.

In summary, at least half of this is a remake, and the structure is very weak, but the footage is breathtaking, there are many moments of dramedy as with the Life series, there is some new and surprising behaviour, and the not-so-new is upgraded. So I'll give it four stars. Personally, I think the best reason for getting this is the breathtaking footage of the ice and landscape.",1323388800,193,4335,5.023676880222841
4883814,5,B005SH65UO,"It is about the life of animals and the seasons in the Arctic and Antarctic, which cover about a third of the area of the earth. It was filmed in HD using the latest technology, which gives this series the edge over previous series. It was three years in the making.

I have been retired for about a year. So I have been buying quite a few of David Attenborough DVD's, to update my education, as I have been working overseas for 20+ years. I have to confess, that I get bored with the plight of Polar bears, whales, penguins and seals very quickly. It covers many other species than the big four, plus superb landscape filming and I did not get bored. I am now up to episode 7 out of 7 as it aires in the UK. Frankly, the camera work was superb, slow motion and time lapse, under-sea, terrestrial and overhead. David's narration was excellent, it kept up my interest. For my fellow Amazonians, this is a must see/listen, it is stunning.

Episodes:
1. ""To the Ends of the Earth"" (This includes Scott of the Antarctic)
2. ""Spring""
3. ""Summer""
4. ""Autumn""
5. ""Winter""
6. ""The Last Frontier"" "" (humans in the Arctic and Antarctica)

UK Review of BD Discs (see below for Region Free issues in USA)
This series was shown for the first time on television in 2011 and created considerable admiration for the latest levels achieved in the photography. Shortly after, in 2012, the Blu-ray version of the series became available to even greater acclaim. Now the same discs can be viewed via the latest 4K televisions, a level of technology which was unavailable for the general public at that time.

The broadcast experience, both visually and sonically, was arguably the best achieved at that time and continued a very long run of natural world triumphs. These have regularly pushed the boundaries of technology relative to their vintage at the time of recording and this series was no exception in that line of development. With the aid of increasingly available 4K televisions, it continues to pack an awesome punch visually.

The structure of the series is essentially showing the transition though the seasons of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter with two flanking programs providing an introduction and a conclusion. Each program follows events in the two Polar Regions by alternating between the two. This allows the viewer an opportunity to make appropriate comparisons in terms of their similarities and differences.

The commentary by David Attenborough for many viewers, and that includes this one, is an integral part of the success of these programs. At all times the depth of his understanding and his commitment and belief in what he says is absolute. It takes the experience far beyond casual, although awe-inspiring, visual entertainment and deeply into the realm of studies. These are delivered in a way that transforms what could be an academic exercise into a gripping natural drama that has implications for all life on earth. The responsibilities for human-kind are made clear as well as the consequences of human behaviour.

Quite apart from the main feature of each program there are also the additional 10 minute features added on, in this case appropriately entitled Freeze frame, which give an insight into the making of part of each program. The second documentary in this series, for example, places a team of just two into the Antarctic to document the lives of the penguins which meet up to breed there. This is the most unimaginably inhospitable environment where prolonged storms lasting for days and with winds of up to 130 mph are a recurring feature. An enduring memory of this sequence is the increasingly deadpan sense of humour exhibited by the two men which leads Attenborough to suggest on more than one occasion that he would doubt their continuing sanity!

The above is only intended to give pointers as to what lies within this series. To do full justice to the series requires an understanding and appreciation that can only be gained by purchasing the discs.

This is a wonderful series and one which may never be repeated as global warming takes its destructive course. This makes an imperative viewing experience.

Frequent experience:
I have found that my Sony Blu-ray player will not play certain UK discs even though they are region-free whereas my Toshiba Blu-ray player has no problem playing the same discs. (USA comment column)

Helpful reply:
You have to have a player that will convert the 1080/50i PAL format into 1080/60i (or 60p), otherwise the discs won't play. I have the Oppo BDP-103 which is spec'd to do it and these discs play fine.  (RW-USA comment column)

Haven't I seen enough of the frozen areas of the earth in other BBC documentaries?""  Let me tell you, no, you have not seen enough of the frozen areas of the earth.  And you can probably stand to see many more scenes of polar bears and penguins.

We were both completely and totally taken aback after watching even the first episode.  Our eyes were glued to the screen as we saw things that we had never seen before (and we have seen MANY nature documentaries) - volcanoes in Antarctica with ice caves; a male polar bear carefully stepping in a female's foot prints as he follows her to find her; and the formation of a gigantic ice berg.  These are just a few of the things in the FIRST episode alone.  I am still awed by the images.

And, unlike Planet Earth and Blue Planet, David Attenborough actually appears throughout this documentary instead of just being the voice over the video.  I don't think any BBC documentary could be complete without his characteristic voice.

We are huge fans of the BBC, and this documentary did not disappoint us.  If anything, we are even more diehard fans of this company and the amazing documentaries that they produce.",1474675200,15,1312,4.540425531914893

I bought this a year or so ago from Amazon and had not watched it.  I loaned it to a friend and have asked for its return and the ""friend"" simply will not return it.  So finally, I gave up and ordered a second one via Amazon--from someone called ""My Moovies"". [That's right; 2 ""o""s.]  out of Lexington, Ky.  It  arrived this morning. The package says at the top: "" 3-Disk Complete Series Collection"" and in the middle of the package ""The Original UK Series Narrated by David Attenborough"".  [Also, I might add, that is how Amazon describes it on their web site.] ..OK Great!  I open it up and to my amazement and ANGER-- there is a total of  ONE[!!!]  Disk.  Not the 3 I paid for --or 2--but 1  [!!!]  You know how  there are 3 little plastic ""pages"" in the containers housing a 3 disk collection. There is just a single circular ridge to hold the ONE disk that is enclosed.  The single disk is labeled FROZEN PLANET: Disk Three; On Thin Ice & Bonus Features.

I'm more of a science / history documentary geek than my wife, and it's held my wife's attention, and it's informed us on some of those animals you or I will never get to see in the wild. From watching whale hunts, to seeing Polar Bears fight, to seeing the ugly elephant seals claim their harem, to watching millions of penguins gather - it's worth it.

It might make even those of us who could care a little less about animals and science even perk our ears up and say, ""It's amazing that they fly from the north to the south pole,"" or ""Wow those are smart!"" Good stuff",1414713600,,835,4.380645161290323

If you appreciated Planet Earth, you would equally appreciate and enjoy Frozen Planet. It documents the absolute beauty and sometime brutal and extreme nature of our beloved Earth at its south and north poles. You will greatly appreciate the work that these individuals have done, especially at brutally cold conditions.

This was also my first long exposure to David Attenborough's narration. I had heard him here and there. But this collection (as well another equally excellent nature documentary entitled Africa: Eye To Eye With the Unknown) was my first opportunity to see him and his narration for an extended and cohesive period of time. While I greatly enjoyed his presentation, and while I have not yet seen his narration version of Planet Earth, I am not sure if I could fare him above Sigourney Weaver as I believe she did an excellent job for Planet Earth.",1397952000,2,981,5.055555555555555

So I ended up buying the whole series of the show and we again watched it together many times now. And surprisingly, he still loves it as much every time we watch.

4884226,5,B005SH65UO,"Walt Disney ruined nature videos for me at a young age. They always seemed contrived and patronizing, even to a grade schooler. Later on I found out they were also fraudulent, with phony scenes and made up ""facts,"" the most famous of which is the lemmings jumping off a cliff en masse.

Jacques Cousteau lured me back to nature videos with his scientific focus and spectacular photography. I didn't even know that David Attenborough existed until a few years ago, two generations after he'd become a British icon of nature television. After being blown away by his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-of-Birds/dp/B000069HXL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life of Birds</a>&nbsp;series, I was hooked on Attenborough.

So it was a surprise to me that there was such a controversy when his Frozen Planet series was being televised in the U.S. with the videos redubbed by Alec Baldwin, and that one episode would not be shown, due to its controversial nature.

Now that I've had a chance to see the series, I understand why Discovery Channel made their decision, although I still don't agree with it. First, though Attenborough is known in America, he never reached Jacques Cousteau's popularity here. That, combined with just enough Briticisms and comparisons to confuse most American viewers (""playing Granny's Footsteps in the snow,"" ""six times the size of the United Kingdom"") must have seemed enough to justify substituting a familiar voice and some minor rewrites. The decision to not air the On Thin Ice episode, about global warming, was less justified. Although there was no way to substitute Attenborough's narration for Baldwin's since Attenborough appeared on camera for much of that episode, I think American audiences will figure it out. It's well worth a tiny bit of discontinuity -- that episode is probably the best one of the series. (Discovery Channel did eventually air the episode.)

While the other episodes are spectacular, they are a bit repetitive -- the vastness of the arctic and antarctic, the polar bears, the penguins, the orcas. Life is nasty, brutish, and short for the polar wildlife. But the On Thin Ice episode explains just what's going on in terms of melting icecaps and rising sea levels at the Poles and what it means for the rest of the planet. It's clear and indisputable, and quite alarming.

Once again, this BBC Planet Earth production is a masterwork of photography. Certainly as much photographic expertise was involved as was scientific expertise. Some of my favorite scenes from the series are the extras that show how the filming was done. The cutting edge equipment, the ingenuity it took to figure out how to get some shots, and the patience involved were all quite remarkable.

Our family is very squeamish when it comes to the brutish aspects of wildlife. These videos did show animals being hunted, and sometimes getting caught. To not show that would make the series unrealistic. But they also didn't dwell on the capture scenes. Once the animal had been caught, the action cuts away before the scene becomes gory. So it's not Disney, but it also isn't Wes Craven.

Lots of extras as well as English & French narration, and English, Spanish, and Canadian French subtitles. Or you can turn off the narration altogether and just listen to music. When it's 105 here in a month or two, an hour of arctic ice will be just the ticket.

4884227,5,B005SH65UO,"Some viewers will stand in line for films of CGI effects creating other planets or ecosystems or strange creatures inhabiting earth all set in the midst of extraordinary pictorial visions. And yet those viewers may simply ignore BBC projects such as this, regarding them as mundane.  But to have the opportunity to see the splendors of the Arctic and the Antarctic - places that really do exist without the need for CGI effects to make them overpowering - is at once breathtaking and terrifying. Such magnificent cinematography in these three discs courtesy of BBC exceeds the imagination of beauty as we know it, and yet are we in the process of destroying it with our ever-increasing disregard for the maintenance of our planet?

Films such as this capture the wonder of nature, the awe-inspiring majesty of endless stretches of ice and snow, the beauties of the wildlife, the power of nature at her best and most glorious.  The narration of Richard Attenborough adds to the spectacle, not only because he is a great broadcaster but also because he cares in his private life as a naturalist to preserve the wonders he describes so well.

There have been some fine films about the two ice-clad poles of our planet - films that place a story in front of the landscape to enhance the story.  But here the landscapes ARE the story and the magnificent animals that call these regions home are great symbols of overcoming odds of climes and conditions and continue to populate their special species.

If watching the sheer beauty of these films is not satisfying enough for the viewers, then consider the fact that these may be disappearing horizons and for many of us these images may be the last we see of the glories of the Arctic and the Antarctic. For that reason alone it is well worth adding this splendid set to the library - for safe keeping.  Highly recommended on every level.  Grady Harp, April 13",1365984000,4,1905,4.734138972809668

The visuals in this series are unforgettable.  The Emperor penguins live in the most extreme conditions in the South Pole and the photographers were there to film the 70 mile trip from the ocean that the males and females took.  Mating took place and when the eggs were hatched, the females transferred the egg to the feet of their mates.  Then the ""girls"" made the challenging and laborious trip back to the ocean to feed for three months while the males hatched the eggs while being beaten by terrible winds and unbelievable sub-zero temperatures.  They are near starvation by the time the females come back and relieve them of their duties.  By that time the eggs have hatched and again the transfer is made from one parent to the other.  Those photographers endured everything the penguins endured without being able to cuddle together for warmth.

For those of you who are interested in seeing life in the polar regions, this one's for you.  The way in which the DVD set is arranged - by season - is a great way to see how the arctic and antarctic regions are during the different times of the year.  The contrasts are amazing.

One might think that the last episode, ""On Thin Ice"", would be a politicized treatise on global warming, but it is just the opposite.  It tackles the problem head on, and provides a great overview of the problem.  No matter what your feelings about this problem are, this episode is a nice summary of what seems to be known about the topic without preaching one way or the other.

In my opinion, what makes this series shine is its narrator, David Attenborough.  While many actors and actresses have taken the challenge to narrate a nature series, none comes close to the throaty but tame voice of Mr. Attenborough.  There is also something about hearing a British accent narrating a nature documentary which just makes it all the more better.

4884342,2,B005SH65UO,"The combination of breath-taking Artic/Antartic video content and the stewardship of David Attenborough give this BBC program redeeming qualities---but having already seen the Americanized version on TV with Alec Baldwin narrating, this original British version to my surprise was simply not quite as good. The video content is mostly the same, but the Baldwin version is presented in more dramatic fashion, I feel. Some of the scenes are rearranged to more exciting effect, the narrative copy is surprisingly different and more effective, and the deeper-voiced Baldwin actually delivers a better read than the legendary Attenborough.

I've been a huge fan of Sir David Attenborough ever since the preeminent Life on Earth series, but for me he doesn't quite bring the same commanding presence that he did 30 years ago (even though he does appear on camera on location at times in this series).

I suppose if I hadn't seen the US version, I would have liked this one more. A great deal of time and effort went into the cinematography of this program, but in the end it's certainly not as enlightening and captivating as Life on Earth or other past Attenborough efforts.",1357344000,9,1169,5.051813471502591

David Attenbourough is very much involved in this film, and will not be out-done, as he shows a genuine concern for the wildlife. This film shows the Arctic wildlife enduring through the most hostile environments on Earth, as they struggle on a daily basis, to survive the best way they know how. This film is on par with the other top-notch BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth, Blue Planet, and Life. The BBC has set the bar with this film because, its one of the best in-depth nature documentaries this year. This movie looks realistic on Blu-ray, and the time-lapse footage of frost expanding in slow motion, has never been seen before. The time-lapse footage of a frozen river, and its motionless water fall, thawing out and re-flowing again, was a first time ever.

Rumor has it the the US version doesn't have the last episode about global warming. That episode is fantastic, and it's not as if David's pressuring you to stop your way of life and become an Eskimo. The episode simply states facts and is indeed very interesting.  I thought at first that this Series was going to be similar to the other frozen episodes in some of the other series, but there is plenty of new footage. Repeats are a minimum. I'd def suggest this!",1355011200,,611,4.407079646017699

The documentary was great. I have to say that some of the footage is quite breathtaking and on my big plasma tv the images are something else. I don't imagine I could live to see all these different animals but by watching this documentary I feel I've lived a more filled life.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't go into detail about the actual documentary but I have to say it is a must to add to your collection, and if you don't have a collection it wouldn't be a bad one to start one with.

This is one of my most favorite. Visually stimulating and educational with a broad focus, not just promoting the political flavor of the month, ie. global warming, but more about conservation of our natural earth. Nature is not always warm fuzzies and it was portrayed as it is funny, sad, awe inspiring and yes, even violent. Nature is, after all, nature and I personally didn't think there undue focus on the gore, but more about the survival of living creatures in a most unhospitable environment. Frozen Planet is well worth watching and owning. I know I will watch it many more times with my grandchildren as well.",1345680000,3,793,4.795620437956204

This disc set won't allow me to select the menu button , this irritate me because I have to watch threw four movie trailer before it displays the main menu.

Is this away of advertising to help pay for this release?

I paid good money, not to be irritate by bunch of trailer at the beginning that won't allow me hit the main menu screen to play the Frozen Planet.

The other thing, it doesn't allow me to start where I left off at. If you are going to put together a 3 dsic set with 7 plus hours, you should at less apply this feature to this disc.

Few other Documentary I own has this feature applied to there disc set.

What I like about this disc set :

They don't show the animals eating there kill, a big plus to me, because I can't stomach that. I remember when National Geographic  was on tv a long time ago, they show the animals pulling off the skin of the animal. I thought that was way to much detail.

So of course I watched it, and was really amazed at how good it was.  Yes the plight of the polar bear and penguin have been done to death, but the footage is fresh, I have never seen polar bears in battle, and there is other new stuff.  I was impressed with the photography, which is ever advancing, so much that planet earth, and the dvd releases are outdated in terms of photography techniques. Some of the material has the ""well I've seen this before..."" but of the six episodes the least interesting was the Summer one.  The seventh episode ""On thin Ice"" I have yet to see (and have no desire of seeing).
I admit I am more intrigued by warmer climates (especially when it involves turtles and lizards) so I am biased.  But I really enjoyed it.",1341964800,,861,4.2317073170731705

There is also tons of great learning for adults as well it has a happy medium.  It's not too in depth but it is a really fun program to watch.  I am also surprised that the global warming card wasn't played stronger in the last episode it goes into the warming and changing environment but i didn't feel it was overboard in pushing an agenda.  Great fun and enjoyable to watch over a few weeks of time.
+ great footage
+ great narrating by David Attenborough
+ interesting story-line, kids can follow as well as adults
- some footage was recycled in separate episodes
- they often return to the same subjects instead of finding new and different things...ie polar bears, killer whales, grey wolves

My favorite footage has to be from the underwater ice and the caving on Mt Erebus, overall 4 for 5 for making entertainment meet learning.",1341446400,6,1001,4.632768361581921

And of course the wonderful voice of David Attenborough as the narrator is just divine. If you love nature, and love to see it up close and in vivid detail and color, this disc set is for you. It is very similar to other series such as Earth. It is divided into sections based on the seasons and what goes on at the North and South Poles at those times. And at the end of each season section there is an added treat of behind the scenes footage showing how they made the film...which of course is the part where you realize that what you have been watching is even more incredible because of the risk to human life to film it.",1337817600,,784,4.233333333333333
