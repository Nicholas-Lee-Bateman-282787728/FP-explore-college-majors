2729840,4,6301955102,"This is one of the few opera DVDs which I am eager to watch again.  Filmed in the Russian countryside and St. Petersburg the staging and acting make this gorgeous production mesmerizing and emotionally affecting.  The attractive actors look and act their parts and lip-synch convincingly.  Every one of the singers is superb and the Bolshoi company has this music in their blood.
The downside is that this film has considerable cuts - all of them internal (cuts within scenes or arias).  It's not disastrous and I  guess it's better to want more than wishing the singers would just get on with it and stop dawdling (Fleming/Horovsky and Chilcott/Hampson).  The sound is not modern state-of-the-art, but my ears adjusted quickly to the good quality 50's production.  The color changes slightly from time to time and there are a few extremely small hiccups during the transitions from one roll of film to the next.  For me, however, these flaws don't  affect my enjoyment of this excellent film one bit.
So, 5 stars for the singing, acting, sets and staging and 3 stars for the (re)production values for an average of 4 stars.  Wish Amazon would provide for rating those two different values separately.
Highly recommended - plus it costs about half that of the opera house productions.",1192492800,50,1284,4.902777777777778
2729841,5,6301955102,Although this opera plays like a movie all of the opera excitement is still present.  The movie is lipsynced where they have different actors and different voices for each actors but this doesn't really pose a problem and the piece moves well. The music is beautiful along with the russian landscapes and ballroom scenes. Much better than the opera we just saw which had just a couch and two chairs for one act. This was a really enjoyable opera to watch so I suggest you just sit back with a bag of popcorn and enjoy the movie.,1012780800,8,528,4.443298969072165
2729842,5,6301955102,"This gorgeous production of Eugene Onegin was absolutely thrilling to a devotee of this opera such as myself. The cuts here and there did not particularly bother me, as they were tastefully done from a musical  standpoint. Occaisionally, the splicing between scenes and tableaux was  poorly done, but again, that is only the blink of an eye. I particularly  enjoyed Lenski's singing, it was light and and absolutely effortless. The  interpreations were wonderful, the scenery (the open Russian countryside)  was unmatched. I very much enjoyed the production, although it must be said  that anything Onegin I have a real partiality to.",963446400,11,634,5.227722772277228
2729843,5,6301955102,"This 1959 (or 1958, depending on your source) production of Tchaikovsky's opera based on Pushkin's novel in verse stars the famous Russian soprano Galina Vishnevskaya as Tatyana.  But you won't see her because, with the  exception of Prince Gremin, all of the principal characters are depicted on  screen by non-singing actors.  The synchronization of the actors and  singers is very well done, and the actors are very good, and easy on the  eye.  It is a beautiful production, with breathtaking locations in St.  Petersburg and the Russian countryside and excellent attention to period  detail.  The soloists, chorus, orchestra and corps de ballet are from the  Bolshoi Theatre.
Also see the more recent Russian production of  ""Eugene Onegin"" (1998).  Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler star in the  non-operatic film version--see ""Eugene Onegin"" (2000).",962323200,18,848,5.325757575757576

8168330,5,6301955102,"I was so lucky to find this extraordinary production purely by chance; to start with, it is done in the most faithful and lavish Luchino Visconti style, with utmost attention to detail, beauty of the voices and actors; it is even more striking that young men - Onegin and Lenski - are exceedingly handsome; much more than the heroines Tatiana and Olga.  While Onegin is a stunning cold blond  beauty in Byron/ Childe Harold -style, Lenski is a passionate romantic beau, appropriately a brunette with long tresses, looking rather as Goethe or dark Schiller.  This is all completely in accordance with Pushkin's lines, and illustrates the marvelous juxtaposition, just as Pushkin describes the two friends:

""They struck a friendship; storm and silence,
 Prose and poem, flame and iceberg
 Could not be different enough"".

And this is just the beginning; as the film proceeds, more amazing images enfold, eventually making an informed viewer (meaning the one who knows and loves Eugine Onegin as Pushkin's poem) believe that this movie is the exact pictorial reincarnation of what Pushkin had imagined for his characters, scenery and every possible nuance.  It must be said that the same result simply cannot be achieved in an opera house, because here in the film all the actors are gorgeous or truthful to their description in the poem, and plus all scenes are filmed in the authentic  Russian environment - be it a summer field, or a frozen snow-covered duel spot, the nabk of Neva river in St-Petersburg, or the ball.  Cinematography is at highest quality here.

It is astonishing to see how much thorough preparation work had been done, and how much respect for the works of art  had been paid.  One thing that strikes the viewer immediately is that Tatiana looks exactly as in Pushkin's own sketches to Eugine Onegin!  And so does her nanny.  Olga (Svetlana Nemolyava) is also a portraiture of Pushkin's description - blond and a little plump; here she act as flippant and emotionally dumb to poor Lenski as Pushkin intended for her - a shallow, empty and opportunistic character - a total opposite of Tatiana, of course.  Tchaikovsky musical genius did not measure up to Pushkin literary one and he failed to reflect that difference in the young ladies music, although Olga does not have much music in the opera anyway.  Certainly, however, on cannot say that Tchaikovsky's music to Eugine Onegin is the best ever written by a Russian composer,  while Puskin's poem is still an unsurpassed masterpiece of Russian language.

However, the music makes its best in a film like this - so opulently, devotedly and exceptionally done.  The singers are also excellent, and it helps immeasurably that they are all native Russian speakers.  Galina Vishnevskaya (Rostropovich's wife later) is splendid in singing Tatiana.

Watching and listening to this film/opera, I suddenly realized that Pushkin had described his own death at a duel in graphic details, only that he, contrary to Lenski, did not die immediately.  Also, what a witty reference to Werther in Lenski's image!  It is another sign of Pushkin's incredible sense of humor and intelligence; no wonder that eventually he had become so isolated - who could rival him in his imagination, coupled with such wits?

It seems to me, especially after re-reading the poem after watching this film, that Pushkin actually expresses himself via the pensive and passionate Tatiana and the romantic dreamer Lenski, while at the same time ridiculing himself though Onegin's eyes, with Onegin representing rationality and reason.  It is worth much contemplation to note that at the end of the poem/opera/film, no one wins.

The end of the opera is  anachronistic compared to the actual poem;  in original poem, Tatiana ends her conversation with Onegin with the most famous, immortal  words in Russian literature :

""I love you (I am not beguiling),
but to another I belong,
and will be his my whole life long"".

After this words, she exits, and the poem finishes.  This to me in poetry akin to the great baroque/classical tradition of music - splendid discipline of form; expression is strong, short and powerful, concentrated and targeted.  However Tchaikovsky, who is already a contemporary of Wagner and the romantic period with it endless formless boundless puddle, has created a continuation of the scene, where Onegin implores Tatiana to flee together;  which of course resonates more with Tchaikovsky own times - we can see Liszt and Countess d'Agoult here, or Anna Karenina and Vronsky, or Emma Bovary and Rodolphe Boulanger.  But here one can  appreciate once more the immense magic of Pushkin's true genius versus mysoginy of Tolstoy, who made Anna karenina an incurable hysteric; or we can admire the elegance of aristocratic Pushkin versus soupy melodrama of bourgeois romantic realism of Flaubert - Tatiana is not Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary; she is too sane for the former and too clever for the latter - and how she rebuffs Onegin!  Only if Emma Bovary and Gustave Flaubert had the insight and intelligence of Tatiana Larina and Alexander Pushkin.  Alas, Tchaikovsky fell victim to the fashion of his times, with the cult of vulgarity gradually taking hold.  He should have finished the opera where the poet did.  However, Tchaikovsky in many other works seems to have a great difficulty to end an opus, just as his contemporaries;  Eugene Onegin musically is not his highest achievement, yet in this film the music lends itself pleasantly.

Needless to say, the debate about ""Eugine Onegin"" continues from the day it was published to this very day, as this is one of the most fascinating works written in Russian and world literature; many interpretations are given to explain the characters and their actions, and even when I was a schoolgirl in Moscow, in 7th grade we were discussing in class whether Tatiana did the right thing or not by rejecting  Onegin.

For a Russian, this story is an eternal enigma.  Why did Tatiana leave Onegin? Why did she not escape with him - with a man she presumably loved so passionately only a few years ago and according to her own words, still loves him?  Onegin is obviously not a Rodolphe Boulanger;  he did indeed behaved nobly, not taking advantage of Tatiana's passion for him; he cautioned her against ruinous mistakes, so in fact he acted as a gentleman.  Why is she so stern with him now -she loved him so madly!  Could it be that she has become a marital martyr, intoxicated of her own virtuousness?  Or is she now a hypocrite and conformist, bound by social conventions  and afraid to follow her love?  Or maybe she simply does not love Onegin anymore, despite her words  - after all, she was a young virgin then, and now is a mature woman, possibly enjoying intimacy of her husband, while Onegin brings back only unpleasant memories of humiliation and rejection she had suffered with him?  Maybe she now has another secret lover and does not want Onegin at all, while letting him suffer more by speaking her love for him?  Or is she a revengeful fury, who takes more pleasure in humiliating her offender than to pursue happiness with the man she actually loves, unable to forgive and forget?  Or maybe ... this is not the end of their love story?  There are many indications that Pushkin intended to write the next chapter; but... it never happened.

Through Pushkin's unparalleled genius, Eugene Onegin poem stirs the mind and imagination today as it did in Pushkin's and Tchaikovsky's own times - major Russian literary critics, as Herzen or Belinsky, devoted numberless pages to the work.  And in me, this film provoked all these and many more thoughts and ideas, but in this review format it is not possible to discuss in detail the pinnacle of Russian literature and a high mark of Russian music; naturally, I give it five stars for the excellent overall quality.  Just to think that post-war USSR was in ruins, with people desperately lacking in everything, and yet such a grandiose production had been made to assert the spirit of Russia and her omnipotence, power and might, is impressive.

Such films are not made anymore; it is a true rarity.  Definitely the sound quality is reflective of the date it was made - in the 50s, but this should not detract a thoughtful and appreciative viewer from the beauty of this masterpiece.

Highly recommended.",1298073600,28,8364,4.916607270135424
