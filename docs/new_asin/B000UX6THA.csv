8215448,3,B000UX6THA,"I can't believe the reviews here.  It's true Norbit was not classic Eddie Murphy but it is mildly entertaining.  The trouble with a comedic brilliance  is that once you've reached the top, everyone expects every word to be hilarious.  It must be impossible to continue working when everything you do is tainted by what you've done.  This is a slick made for money and gimic type movie but Eddie's Work in it is fantastic is dumbed down by the script.
In the age of reality tv, I'm happy that they are still offerings like this.
I found it more entertaining that I did Coming to America.",1209600000,,586,4.490566037735849
