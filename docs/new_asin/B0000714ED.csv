1798226,5,B0000714ED,"This was made years before his stroke, so his health issues aren't really touched upon here.  Like every African American, I love  his music.  Unfortunately, I never knew much about the man.  Here you get to hear about his rise to fame, his family, his musical influences, and even his home decorations.  Stars like David Bowie, Whitney Houston, and others praise him as well.  Unfortunately, Lutha screams, ""None of your bee's wax.""  when it comes to his sexual identity.  As much as folk love you, Lutha, you shouldn't be afraid to come out.  I'll be here for you, honey!  We need gay, black role models like you out there to be representing for us!  Everyone should peep this documentary.  Also see the chapter on him in ""The Greatest Taboo:  Homosexuality in Black Communities.""",1077062400,27,782,4.7894736842105265
7973569,5,B0000714ED,Loved it!  This is an interview with Luther.  As a super-fan it delighted my heart to see Luther talk about his life and his music.  I don't know of any other interviews of him available for purchase so this is a rare find.,1473638400,,223,4.1395348837209305
7973570,3,B0000714ED,"Today is April 20, 2015, and it's Luther Vandross's birthday. So, today is the day I celebrate his birthday by watching this documentary with him. It's been ten years since Luther passed away, so watching this documentary brings back memories of him as to what a great singer he was.

This movie is a documentary with Luther Vandross talking about his life and musical career. I would watch this movie every now and then, and remember what a great singer and person Luther was. What I also like about this movie is the interview with Luther talking, his appearance, and how slim he was. The Luther I see in front of the camera talking in the interview is what I like to see, know, and remember; not big and heavy. I not only like Luther Vandross as a great singer, but a person just being Luther; like Whitney Houston said in this movie in one of the interiews is that not only was Luther a great singer, but what a great person and fun guy he was to be with. I can also believe that Luther Vandross was not gay, and that he was a normal guy just being Luther and a great singer. I remember that this documentary came out in 2001, which was Luther's 20th year of his musical career. It also shows his mother talking about him, and when she was pregnant with him and almost died. And Luther's musical director and close friends talk in the interviews. Luther passed away on July 1, 2005, and this documentary brings back good memories of him and how great he was. And by remembering Luther and just by looking at his appearance as my favorite singer, I like him thin. I don't like the big and heavy Luther, so the thin Luther Vandross is what I would like to know and remember as my favorite singer. This documentary should even be watched on Luther's birthday April 20th, or on July 1st the he passed, to celebrate his life and legacy as to what a great singer he was.

There's also a movie called ""The Best Of Luther Vandross,"" a 1991 VHS tape with all of Luther's videos from 1981, and I have that video cassette tape copied on a DVD. That was a movie that came out ten years before this documentary was made, and that movie shows interviews with Luther talking within his videos just like this documentary. And I would watch that movie with Luther's videos, along with this documentary, so that there would be something else for me to watch with Luther Vandross. And there's a also ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single, a DVD with three videos from Luther's last 2 albums and that came out in the same era as this documentary. So, even when I watch this documentary with Luther, I would also watch that DVD single with those three videos, along with the videos from ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" movie. I would also play Luther's music as well.

This documentary was also made in the same year when Luther came out with his self-titled debut album, ""Luther Vandross,"" with the J Records label. And I have that 2001 album by Luther Vandross, and a 2003 album, ""Dance With My Father,"" that Luther came out with after that album and before he passed away. So, even when I watch this documenary with Luther Vandross, I would also play those last 2 albums with his music, and his music from some other albums that he put out. I remember back in 2001 when I first saw this documentary with Luther on the BET channel, and I liked it. I not only would watch this documentary to remember Luther as a great singer, but to also see and remember what he looked like as slim Luther.",1416528000,,3469,4.400311526479751
7973571,5,B0000714ED,"This video provides some great first hand accounts and experiences of Luther's life. It was nice to hear Luther talk about his life.  Also, it was great to hear Whitney talk about him too. When I think about the best voices to ever sing, Luther and Whitney rise to the top. This video makes me grateful that we had a chance to experience them both in our lifetime.",1388102400,,364,4.352941176470588
7973572,4,B0000714ED,It was really great to see this interview with Luther and how he came up with so of the most amazing music in the past 30 years or so.  It was really a great history lesson.,1361404800,,173,3.8055555555555554
7973573,5,B0000714ED,"MR LUTHER VANDROSS, in my opinion, is the greatest male vocalist of this generation. The close attention he pays to detail is truly painstaking. His smooth creamy voice is unmistakable. I own all his amazing albums!!!.
I always wanted to take a journey through his life and mind, just to know him some more...and this beautiful DVD truly did it!!, from his childhood to his rise to the very top of the business in his own words.
I never know that he suffered so much pain by the passing of his dad and three other siblings..I felt sorry for him.
His personal life was and is still a mystery to me. The name LUTHER VANDROSS has never ever been intimately associated with any known woman, he was never married and have no children of his own, there are hushed whispers that LUTHER VANDROSS is a closeted homosexual but I guess ""we must mind our f@$%&ing business"" !!! I like that. He was very close to his dear mom. He was basically a funny person with some health problems which eventualy took his life..shortly after his mom passed too...may GOD rest thier souls...The only drawback..it could be longer !!.
This concise look at LUTHER is excellent, a must have for fans, highly recomended !!!.",1304208000,,1193,4.605633802816901
7973574,5,B0000714ED,"BET's biographical dvd of Luther Vandross ia an outsanding videography of the late great legend.  Since Luther's death, I purchased the narrative and have seen it at least 50 times.  It is well written and very insightful.  Every time I watch it I learn something new about Luther.  However, unlike so many others, I did not hear any underlined inuendos of confessions of gayism.  Furthermore, I do not believe that Luther was gay.  I remember clearly how the rumor was started and how he and his publicist tried hard to refute it.  But, Luther was a brother and once he was tainted .....oh well.  I think that if people read the biography of Luther by Craig Seymour, along with watching this dvd, they would get a better understanding of this great man and who he really was.",1151020800,6,776,4.613138686131387
7973575,5,B0000714ED,"Excellent DVD, Luther talks about him and the things that went on in his life.  This dvd is the only one that I know of that has Luther actually doing an interview.  Many people are on the dvd but most of it is Luther.  A must have for Luther fans.",1124496000,13,248,3.92
7973576,5,B0000714ED,My onlly regret is that this documentary wasn't longer. It gave a very concise and complete history of the life and music of Luther Vandross. It's a must have for a artist collection on dvd.,1123200000,12,190,4.457142857142857
7973577,5,B0000714ED,"this DVD surrounds itself with enlightening viewers of the fulfilling life of Luther Vandross. his accomplishments, his rises and falls...which were far and few in between, as this singer/songwriter maintained a steady climb, safely and most assuredly to the top.

I would highly recommend this DVD to any and all desiring to see Luther and learn of a great one who has graced our presence and left his mark on all of our hearts.

thank you BET, for this legacy.",1122940800,11,462,4.7625
