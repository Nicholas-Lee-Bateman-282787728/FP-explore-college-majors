4643830,5,B005BO5QBS,"Excellent set of BBC ""remakes"" of the famous Rattigan plays, with some of the great UK actors of the late 20th century.

The gem of the collection (IMHO) is Heart to Heart, first shown on television in 1962.  In the opening sequence we see a British Television Company (BTV, not BBC!) studio which is a seemingly disorganised clutter of thick cables and heavy cameras, silently manipulated by technicians.  The control room contains a battery of cathode ray tube monitors and the atmosphere is tense.  The cameras are trained on a small raised platform with a couple of  chairs upon which the interviewer and his subject face each other.  The part of the interviewer is played by Kenneth More.  He is not the cheery young chappie that we came  to know in most of his films, but a mature and intelligent man stressed by his job in front of an audience of 15 million.  At the same time, he is trying to overcome a drinking problem.  A breaking point is reached when the interviewer comes before the cameras with a dodgy cabinet minister who presents himself as a bluff man of the people -- played brilliantly by Sir Ralph Richardson.

This play takes us back fifty years to a technically primitive era of television, with its cumbersome cameras and flickery black and white pictures, watched by millions of viewers before audience fragmentation set in.  But Terence Rattigans theme is 100% up-to-date: the psychological pressures and the moral dilemmas of people who are overexposed to public view, whether in the media or in politics.  The play is recommended viewing for todays troubled times.",1374105600,14,1593,4.833948339483395
4643831,3,B005BO5QBS,I was unfamiliar with most of these plays and felt that they did not measure up to the standard of the author's The Winslow Boy and The Browning Version.,1358812800,,153,4.310344827586207
4643832,5,B005BO5QBS,"I am a fan of Terence Rattigan so I was already familiar with most of the plays. However I was not prepared for the high quality of the acting. Most of the actors are simply superb. The BBC commercials are indeed intrusive, but the rest is definitely worth experiencing.",1357084800,16,270,4.530612244897959
4643833,4,B005BO5QBS,"This is a collection of Rattigan plays featuring the very finest of British actors and directors.  It is indeed first rate and worth the high price.  Warning: This is serious theater, and not something designed to attract most American movie-goers.

There are two slight problems.  The packaging is cheap, and the discs will not stay in place. I heard one of our discs rattling around before I opened the package.  Fortunately, there was no damage.  Secondly, each disc contains five minutes of commercials, which you cannot accelerate out of or click off.  I've never seen this before, and don't care if I never see it again.  BBCA is to blame, and if you watch that channel frequently you won't mind the stupid commercials.  In any case, buy this collection, as it is marvelous.",1322006400,28,780,4.804511278195489

8464074,5,B005BO5QBS,"A good set of plays by a once very popular playwright, but not one we see very much of these days.  Filmed plays are always difficult and that is no exception in this set of Rattigan plays.  Nonetheless, most of us rarely get the opportunity to see plays much less plays with such fine actors and actresses as this collection of film plays has.  Many of Britain's finest actors and actresses are in these plays, in many cases early in their careers.",1481328000,3,449,4.451219512195122
8464075,1,B005BO5QBS,"i did not purchase this because i did not know the plays included. none of the reviewers mentioned them, though one person said there were nine, nor did the editorial review staff for amazon. the same is true of the noel coward collection. i am not one to buy a pig in a poke.",1480032000,4,276,4.12962962962963
8464076,5,B005BO5QBS,"A superb collection by one of the great dramatists of the twentieth century. However, for Bond fans, I found the Sean Connery drama the weakest of the bunch.",1472860800,,157,4.642857142857143
8464077,4,B005BO5QBS,"I don't often go to see plays because on the whole-- and please forgive the bigotry-- actors (or more precisely actors' inflated egos) annoy me, and they tend to be more untethered under the limelight than in front of a camera.  So it was with some hesitancy that I picked up this Rattigan set, and with minor justification.  I consider Asquith's 'The Browning Version' and Delbert Mann's 'Separate Tables' to be two of the finest mannered dramas ever filmed, and not in small part thanks to Mr. Rattigan's estimable storytelling skills.  But after watching the nine features included in this BBC collection I'm left a little underwhelmed by the performances.  The early stuff ('Heart to Heart' and 'Adventure Story' in particular) is, forgivably, overacted, and the others, while perfectly enjoyable on an intellectual level, come off somewhat dry and lacking passion.  With these caveats in mind, I still recommend this tribute to a largely forgotten (and here, at least, provincialized) talent, but don't expect fireworks.  3 1/2 stars for content and presentation (extras are negligible).",1468886400,,1092,5.211428571428572
