7970463,3,B00006JMRC,"Horror fan Steve (Peter Stanovich) wants to make a video/film in an abandoned and possibly haunted studio of his idol. The studio was stopped being used when an actor died while filming. The script he has in mind is: ""Naughty Sex Kittens vs The Giant Praying Mantis."" The film must be shot in nine hours in 55 minute intervals. The lights must be out 5 minutes of every hour while the deaf night man makes his rounds.

Yes, it is campy. In some ways it spoofs horror slashers, but doesn't do it well enough to be a spoof. It is just a silly film with a lot of nudity.

7970464,4,B00006JMRC,"Slaughter Studios was home to some of the best cheesy movies around.  But it all came to an end when an actor was killed on the set when blanks were replaced by real bullets.  Vacant for many years, a horror fan has created a plan to break into the studio and film a movie in one night.  He has the guard's schedule mapped out, located power, and recruited a cast.  They are all set to make the film.

But once inside the studio things begin to go wrong.  The far-from-professional actors take too long to do their scenes, they don't do as they are told, and they start wandering away.  This is a horror film so you know the inevitable happens.  As each person finds themselves alone they become a target to a killer.  Who is the killer?  Is it one of them?  Is it the ghost of the dead actor?  You will have to watch the film to find out.

This one is pretty good for what it is.  Our main character, the director wannabe, seems patterned after Dom Deluise for looks and flamboyance.  One of the girls cast in the film is obsessed with the dead actor.  The plot is almost cute until the horror starts.  While essentially a slasher film it is low on the blood and gore (but not non-existent) which is a nice change.  The film makers look to have had a lot of fun making this one and it rubs off on the viewer.  Check it out.",1169078400,5,1324,4.16205533596838
7970465,5,B00006JMRC,"Slaughter Studios is more than a movie. It is more than an event. It is life itself. There is no one that can place themselves right alongside a character in this film and not yell Oh my God! Thats me!!!
First we have our Director. A man with a dream, a camcorder, a two page script, and an array of misfit actors. See him try to get everything together for the ultimate movie, yet see his dream smashed on the rocks of a stormy beach. The cast won't cooperate, the night watchman is lurking about, theres a ghost, and a horndog Arab boy. Who can win with this much against them? Alas our hero dies miserably, film unmade.
Next is our Horndog. What 12 year old boy didn't act like this? What 20 year old man? What 30 year old man? Yes the story and character are as old as mankind itself. Guys like big breasts and think of sex 23 hours a day (when they're not eating).
Next is our Starlet. She is beautiful, spoiled, a pain in the arse, and drugged up. She reminded me of my prom date in everyway. She won't take her top off until shes drugged, she cant be raped until shes willing. She dies without knowing whats going on. How many lovely bimbos do we know who are just like this? God bless them all.
Now for our Goth. Shes smart, she hot, she wears black lipstick. Not nude as often as Id like, but an able bodied chum you can depend on. Like all Goths.
On to our Super-Chested Fantasy Girl. Ah, now heres a woman! Stacked in front and back. Her downfall is her love for the dead actor. Her scrapbook and devotion reminds me of my Marilyn Monroe collection. Though I never met her, Ive been in love with her all my life. I can only hope she doesnt kill me someday.
How about the Demure sex kitten? Shes quiet, you can walk all over her, and shell take all your abuse. To boot she has a great body and looks swell with her hair down. Shes like the cousin in your own family that you wish you weren't related to. You might as well forget about what you're thinking everytime you see her. Believe me, I gave in to temptation. Family reunions were never the same. She doesnt like my wife and my old lady won't let us out of her sight for a second. Its a good thing I married a cousin through marriage. Of course theres always the lesbian fantasy, but we get that in our film here.
Finally we have our Im just a dude in a bug costume guy. The common man, the good man, the man of virtue and truth. Oh how well known you are my friend, though unappreciated. I salute you sir. For the common good of society, you are the corner stone.
Good Night.",1073347200,3,2542,4.158215010141988
