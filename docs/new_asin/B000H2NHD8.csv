8136058,5,B000H2NHD8,"After watching the first two installments of this amazing collection of specials it amazes me the leaps in changes in quality.  But that's not the only thing that's gotten better over time, like fine wine, Bob Hope just gets better.  This time around Bob tours through Vietnam, USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the USS Bennington.

Phyllis Diller is absolutely down right hilarious in her stint with Bob, creating a great combo of sarcasm and self cynicism.  Then there's the usual suspects of Joey Heatherton, Anita Bryant, and Miss World; all gracing the DVD with their beauty, brains, and interaction with the legend, Bob Hope.",1164931200,,632,5.048076923076923
