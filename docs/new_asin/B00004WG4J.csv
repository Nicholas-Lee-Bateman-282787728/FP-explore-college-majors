1363925,3,B00004WG4J,"Ballykissangle is a series that follows the ups and down of a small beautiful town in Ireland. This series focuses on the final conclusion of Peter and Assumpta relationship and unfortunately it leaves much to be desired. Thank goodness for the supporting cast who delivers to the fullest in each episode which leave viewers who love the series wanting more and looking forward to series four? Episode eleven and twelve between Peter and Assumpta was poorly written and not to give away the plot, but after the drama that builds up from the previous episodes and series one and two (Which are excellent); the final conclusion was rushed and quite simply unmoving due to the fact that it leaves the viewers unfulfilled. From the research I have conducted the final plot was Dervla Kirwan inspiration. I speculate if there are any regrets on her part or that of Stephen Tompkinson. However, with Tina Kellegher, Tony Doyle, Peter Hanley, Gary Whelan, and Deirdre Donnelly is quite enough to make the purchase of this DVD and with anticipation series four, five and six, worthwhile!",1107734400,5,1079,4.934065934065934
1363926,5,B00004WG4J,"These two episodes of Ballykissangel are excellent representations of the series.  They allow you to feel the joy, pain, and humor of the characters of Ballykissangel.  The series captures the culture and the atmosphere of  small-town life in Ireland.  I highly recommend this volume and the series  as a whole.",928195200,16,311,5.14
1363937,4,B00004WG4J,Can't believe that the entire series is not offered! Very disappointing to be cut off in the midst of viewing the excellent BBC broadcast,1424476800,,137,4.75
1363938,5,B00004WG4J,"Absolutely loved the Ballykissangel, all the seasons, this one is no exception. I was sad to see the original ""Ballykiss"" end.",1424476800,,126,5.0476190476190474
1363939,5,B00004WG4J,I loved this series and was in middle of the 5th season when Amazon took it off about a week ago so I didn't get to finish the 5th and 6th Season. Bummer.,1424390400,,154,3.696969696969697
1363940,4,B00004WG4J,"This is the season that completely changes the direction of the show, but it's quite good. Sadly, this series is no longer available on Amazon to stream.",1424390400,,153,4.703703703703703
1363941,4,B00004WG4J,"The first four seasons of Ballykissangel are absolutely delightful.  I binge watched all the way through.  The actors who brought these fascinating characters in a small Irish village to life do a wonderful job.  Unfortunately, the latter seasons with the loss of main characters, turn over in the minor roles, and a too convenient death make the latter seasons while worth seeing to the end take a much darker path.  It is understandable why the series was cancelled.",1424390400,,468,4.961538461538462

1363957,5,B00004WG4J,"Great Irish show. However, half way through viewing the third season, a message came up that it was no longer available.  Hopefully, it will come back.",1424390400,,151,4.8076923076923075
1363958,5,B00004WG4J,Excellent. It is a shame that is no longer available for Amazon Prime.,1424390400,,70,4.461538461538462
1363959,5,B00004WG4J,There aren't enough stars in the sky to rate this series! Why can't the U.S. Film industry put out quality entertainment of this caliber?,1424390400,,137,4.75
1363960,5,B00004WG4J,"I loved it- I wish Amazon had given a slight warning when they were pulling it from instant video...I was in the middle of an episode, had to break to make dinner, and POOF gone.
I would reco season 1 and 2 most",1424390400,,211,3.9302325581395348

1363968,4,B00004WG4J,"I must say that I have arrived late to this series since it is now 2015.  I definitely have enjoyed it.  But I became irritated with the caustic/grumpy Assumpta and the moody Father Peter.  I realize that they probably played their roles via the directors orders, but it was tiresome.  I was not sad when Assumpta died.  I had enjoyed the sub characters more, along with the beautiful country side.  I would definitely encourage viewing of this past series.",1420243200,,457,4.7215189873417724
1363969,5,B00004WG4J,The classiest and most sensitive write-out of a character I've ever seen in series TV.  Well done.,1420243200,,98,4.764705882352941
1363970,2,B00004WG4J,"I was furious about the last episode of season three. If the actors wanted to pursue other things, surely there were better ways to handle
the story. I have lost my enthusiasm for the show after that.",1420156800,,200,4.4324324324324325
1363971,4,B00004WG4J,"having been to Ireland, it was nice to recall how beautiful the countryside is, and that life in the village revolves around everyone and all their foibles.",1420156800,,156,4.814814814814815
1363972,4,B00004WG4J,"I debated about giving this a five star review, but thought not. Sometimes, in the writing, things said were later played like they were not. I appreciated the tension building they had going, but with the male and female leads being as good as they were, they missed the mark a little. It was, however, charming, seemed to be very Irish Village-ish and I came away glad I watched. I liked the guy who played Father Peter Clifford very much, thought he was outstanding in this role. When he walked into the sunset, I lost interest.",1420156800,,531,4.541666666666667
1363973,3,B00004WG4J,"The series drags and the season end was depressing.  Left me feeling bad for a long time.  The only interesting characters in the show were Father Peter, Asumpta, Brendan, the female vet whose name I can't spell, the Doctor (who is rarely on) and Ambrose (NOT his wife).  However the central character is the Priest and somehow the series writers seemed to forget that beginning i season 2. I find myself skipping through parts to get to Father Peters scenes and those of Brendan.  SPOILER - every time you get invested in a character in this series they leave.",1420156800,,561,4.636363636363637

1363992,5,B00004WG4J,"Never saccharine, rarely absurd, this absorbing series features interesting, absorbing, imperfect characters whom one quickly comes to care about. Like Northern Exposure or Doc Martin set in Ireland, BallyK is funny and tender in equal parts. A great antidote to lonely evenings and grouchy moods!",1419292800,,297,5.622222222222222

1364065,4,B00004WG4J,"Season 1 was good. Season 2 was better. Season 3 was by far the Best.
I believe the series should've had one additional 90 minute episode at the close of season 3 to neatly wrap up any dangling loose ends. The show could've ended then while it was at its peak, both, in quality storyline and ratings. The cast changes just couldn't recapture the intensity of the chemistry of the main characters who's departure left such a tremendous void that their ""replacements"" couldn't begin to fill.",1412380800,,489,4.6976744186046515

1364115,5,B00004WG4J,"I was surprised by this series of six seasons I was and am still entertained through season 4, as far as I've gotten so far. The series is set in Northern Ireland some time in the 1990s after shoulder straps were necessary to carry a cellphone and just before they became so small, they were easy to lose. Place one English priest in a very small wholly Irish village, Ballykissangel, populated by characters and you have the makings of an entertaining tale of good deeds, misdeeds and no deeds that is mostly comedic but occasionally dramatic. There's plenty of brogue as one might expect but it's all easily understood.",1406851200,,621,4.706422018348624

The tight knit group of neighbors are a varied group who do not always see eye to eye, sometimes fight, and often take care of each other. They are an appealing, and sometimes complicated, group of characters. The stories server up equal parts drama and humor.  I am up to season 4 and have enjoyed most of the episodes.

We are huge fans of this series. Out only regret is that we didn't discover it until a couple of months ago, almost 18 years after it started. Thanks, Amazon Prime, for bringing this to us.
I meets our Not-A-Soap-Opera Test, since the people (most of them), although human, are doing the best they can to live good lives, love and support each other, and lift each other up. Character development is great, story lines are well done, and most of the characters are likable and believable. If we had any complaint, it's that too many beloved characters are killed off or moved away
Watch three episodes: you'll be hooked.",1405468800,,668,4.669491525423729

1364146,3,B00004WG4J,"Sorry for this spoiler if you haven't seen Season 3, yet. I have never much liked a series where the primary characters are killed off or otherwise written out of the story. Even though the name of the show (Ballykissangel) indicates a story about the ""town"", too much continuity is lost when two of the primary characters leave the show. It becomes a very different (or repetitive) story. I was terribly disappointed at the way the story line changed with the new characters.",1405123200,,476,4.746987951807229

Believable characters, a homespun town in the beautiful countryside, people trying to do the right thing & having to struggle to figure out what that is.  I came to love them all--beautiful, ugly, colorful or drab--and I will very much miss that little world, that little pub, and how it all fit together.  I'll imagine each of these people going on in one way or another, and think of them fondly, like friends from some un-repeatable time in my life, years ago.  The wrapping-up of the very last episode was as necessary for me as it was for the series.  I'm only sorry there's no more!",1403740800,,748,4.75968992248062

1364168,5,B00004WG4J,We love this show so much that we saw an episode almost every night until the end of season 3 when Asumpta died and the priest left. I hope it will still be interesting after the disappearance of these two main characters.,1403395200,,222,4.309523809523809
1364169,5,B00004WG4J,All of the characters are well developed and acted. Each episode is a combination that includes amusing interactions or situations and those that are more complex and difficult for the relationships involved.

I love getting to know the folks of this small Irish town, with their faults and virtues and their patience with each other.  I love watching Father Peter ""mature"" as a person, and his honest trying to grapple with the mixed pulls inside him, his ideals versus his real self as a human being.  I've gone on myself trying to imagine how Peter handles the shock dealt him by ?Fate?, where does he go from here?

Love the people of the village and especially Father Clifford and Assumpta.  Just discovered this recently.  It is an older program but a good story is good no matter what the age. Wish there was another program that could close to the quality of writing and acting!  Beautiful location! I keep telling others about Ballykissangel and my sister finally watched it and she also greatly enjoyed it.  There is so much junk on TV.

1364195,5,B00004WG4J,"...to the series, despite the fact that I long ago left the Catholic Church.  I must have had the 1st season on my ""Kindle carousel"" for several months before deciding to watch it with my wife.  The relationship which developed between Assumpta and Peter was heartwarming.  The light-hearted antics of the other characters was always entertaining, but the feelings of the two main characters for each other overshadowed everything else that went on.  I read that they fell in love on the set, and that seems to have added to the genuine feelings that they portrayed in their characters.

When Assumpta died, I was nearly as devastated as Peter!  Seeing Peter subsequently don his backpack to walk out of the village of Ballykissangel was indescribably sad to me.  I was literally ""in mourning"" for a week afterwards; couldn't think of anything else!  Seems silly, I know  ... but the feelings between the Peter and Assumpta seemed to transcend the fact that it was simply a ""TV series"".  I have to say that this was the most powerful story of unrequited love that I have ever read, or seen, in my 59 years.

We've continued watching further episodes, but, though they are still worth watching, the heart and soul of the series died with Assumpta, I'm afraid.  I guess I'll have to get the series ""Wild at Heart"" to see more of Stephen Tompkinson's acting...",1399593600,3,1357,4.752136752136752

I just felt that The series would have been better if Assumpta had not died and Peter had left the church and had made a life with her. It would have been interesting to see their lives when a new priest was assigned. The show lost a lot of heart when these two characters departed.

Not to repeat other reviewers, we were introduced to some villagers who were multidimensional, some who provided comic relief and seemed to never learn a single lesson.  There were characters who had tremendous integrity, and some never admitted their shallowness.

 Ballyk presented magnificent landscapes.  Ballyk made me envious of village life, yet also taught another side - surviving in a place where everybody know your name and your family's name fife generations back.

Most of all, I really loved the people of Ballk.",1394755200,,664,4.927927927927928

1364247,5,B00004WG4J,"I fell in love with Ballykissangel within 3 minutes of the very first episode.  The characters are real, they dress like real people, they aren't all 'beautiful', they are people that I came to care about. These are well written stories with great characters & the episodes grow from each other, altho, each can also stand alone.
The series was shot in the Irish town of Avoca, believe me, if I could, I'd go there.
Ballykissangel is also a learning experience, when a character is busing to work & working long hours is asked why he stays, the answer is ""Look at this"" and the scenery is beautiful.  When a character comes back to town after being gone for many years, the depth of feelings the townsfolk have is remarkable, but then, many of these people have been born & raised there as have generations before them. There are festivals, events, deaths, marriages, births, arguments and always a sense of who these people are. They are Irish.
To see a beautiful small town, with people that know each other, to meet the characters - and they are memorable is a treat, a treasure.
I own the entire series. When I get sad, I go to Ballykissangel.  I can't recommend this enough.",1394064000,,1179,4.578199052132701

Asumpta Fitzgerald is the local public house owner and avowed anti-priest and all things Church who slowly changes her thoughts after Father Clifford arrives and shows his compassion and care for his ""flock"".

1364289,5,B00004WG4J,"This series is a gift, as simple as that.  In the past then have been occasions when we would rush through as many episodes of a program as possible.  With BallyK we treat it as dessert or something special to lift our spirits.  Cannot remember an occasion when were not smiling or grinning at the completion of an episode.

This is a simple tale about life in a small town in Northern Ireand.  The characters are real and the acting is truly splendid.  It was spruced some years ago, so you don't have fancy graphics or astonishing visual effects.  But the issues are real and important and these people work through them together.

This is a winner.  You'll be very pleased you've found it.",1391731200,,692,4.516129032258065

1364291,5,B00004WG4J,"I have enjoyed most of these episodes. The story takes place in Ireland and it's interesting to see the cultural differences. The (fictional) village of Ballykissangel is supposed to represent a tiny village of maybe 200-300 people, though there are times in scenes when many more people appear than seems real for such a place. There is one scene that takes place in a grocery store that is far too big for this town. I'd expect such a store in a city of 10000 or bigger. But these are minor complaints.
Sadly, for me, the two main characters leave the show after season 3. So far, episodes in season 4 are disappointing.",1391299200,,622,4.5625

1364315,5,B00004WG4J,"Powerful television. Takes a bit to get into the cultural differences (I am a Yank, lol!). But what a view of village life. More, the slow burn of the romance between Father Clifford and Assumpta Fitzgerald, probably couldn't happen in the States. We are just too impatient. More, how all the relationships evolve might be too sophisticated for Americans. We just can't wait to see how things turn out.

Not since the 80s, has television been this patient. I have to say each episode seems to draw me in more deeply. We own the whole set, so we CAN watch Ballyk one after the other. We are now at the start of Season 4 (tonight maybe with a nice cuppa, curled up on the sofa?). The thing is, after the power of Season 3, I wonder if it CAN ever be THIS good?

We'll see...

Long running series have cast changes, and I have noticed that when Father Peter and Assumpta weren't in the episode(s), I missed them. Now, with the two leaving the series...I worry whether it can ever be this good again.

Instead of centering on the priest or Fitzgerald's Pub, it seems as Quigley gets more action than any others.  All in all, however, Ballykissangel remains one of my favorites.

1364345,5,B00004WG4J,"They should have ended the show as abruptly as they a life, and a relationship in the next to last show of series three.  I've watched all the shows of all the series, and for me, it ends when Peter (Father Peter Clifford) tells Asumpta that he loves her, and her comment about removing his collar before saying that. Until that moment, this show was five stars!  I refuse to watch the rest of that show. I've seen enough of death & suffering. I am a disabled firefighter-medic and nurse, disabled due to a fire injury. I was brought up in the Catholic church, was an altar boy and considered the priesthood, until I realized how much I liked girls, and left the church many years ago, and what Peter started feeling, with lots of help from Father Mac, is what I felt. Why couldn't they have allowed Asumpta & Peter to go off the show, happy, and together?? I thoroughly enjoyed the first three series. The characters were complicated, and fun. The enjoyment left with Asumpta's death and Peter's leaving, after throwing his Roman collar in the river. Besides Niamh and Ambrose (another destroyed relationship later on), the only other interesting character is Orla, sister of the next priest to come to Ballyk. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Asumpta & Peter grow from mistrust and prejudice on the side of Asumpta, to their hardly unknown growing feelings for each other as the show, and the first three series built up to that final act. Despite my name, I'm told I have Irish in me, and one movie, ""THE QUIET MAN"", and two acts, ""CELTIC WOMAN"" & ""BALLYKISSANGEL"" have piqued my interest in Ireland, at least the first three series of Ballyk. I'll only watch the rest of them, as my wife hasn't yet seen them all, as I have, and I would rather not. These first three series are as entertaining as they can be, and I have a few favorite episodes.  ""WHEN A CHILD IS BORN"" is one of them, as Peter starts to question what he does. All of the series seem to want to paint a certain picture of the ""church"", which isn't a good picture, always, especially with Father Mac and his ways of bias and lack of what I would call true Christian virtue. Peter & Asumpta were the main characters, but other characters shine through, but it is the loss of Peter & Asumpta that brings this show to an abrupt and sad halt, and  it never picks up again. The show also paints a certain picture of the Irish, and the priests, who never seem to let the opportunity to have a drink go by, or the dirty dealings of Quigley and Dooley to be so up front.
But, this show really brings out some serious social issues in an honest way, such as young girls abandoning babies on the priest's doorstep, domestic violence, among others. This show is important, and great for bringing these issues out in the manner they did. But later, a woman, Niamh, tells Father Peter, the first time she ever spoke to him, (Series 1, first show), that she doesn't believe in divorce, changes her outlook in a later series. Another tragedy is portrayed. This world is full enough of tragedies, that what was a decent show doesn't have to resort to ""soap opera"" thinking. Thank you for the first three seasons, at least until it came to an abrupt and painful end, in ""THE RECKONING"", the last part of which I'll never watch again, when Father Peter is basically forced to give Last Rites to the woman he loves, and whom he knows didn't want them. The rest of the series are hardly worth watching. Sad, but true.",1388361600,,3478,4.489731437598736

Now that I've moved back, I've been trying to find it again. Some of the Seasons I watched on videos from the library and eventually began looking for the other seasons online. I was happy to find them on Amazon.

This series takes place in a small town in Ireland. I believe it's aim is to show typical everyday life through several diverse characters. A new priest comes to Ballykissangel. He's English. The community shows its reluctance to accept this person in many ways. For heaven's sake he's English!! It's great fun to watch the interactions. And then there's the priest needling his boss. Brian Quigley another character runs just afoul of the law and his two bumbling helpers add great comic relief. Other characters are just as compelling and believable.

 I have loved every moment watching this series. Especially the first few seasons. Other reviewers have said the last two seasons were not as fun and were not as well written. I agree that they moved slower and seemed a bit blander, but I enjoyed them anyway.

As with most ""gentle humor"" TV programs coming from Great Britain, in this case Ireland, the writing far surpasses most of those written here in the Colonies. My only complaint is that the program, at least as provided on Amazon Prime, does not provide closed captioning.

I didn't like when they got rid of different characters and sometimes with no explanations to why or where.  The characters were like your friends.  I find myself going back to the different episodes to make sure I've seen everything.  I think I actually must've skipped one without realizing it.

1364406,2,B00004WG4J,"This isn't the first time that a series from across the Pond has done weird things to their main characters.  I'm assuming the two lead players, Assumpta and Father Peter, wanted out of the series because killing her off and dispatching the mourning priest in agonizing despair was such a horrible ending for these two after three seasons of a build-up and I felt totally manipulated.  I would have been happier if their relationship had stayed under wraps and both had simply left for less dramatic reasons.  After this plot point, which neatly but cruelly wrote them out, the writers and creators threw caution to the wind and killed off another main character as well. I know this because I scanned the rest of the episodic blurbs and that was enough for me.  Really ridiculous how many twists and turns the village inhabitants took in the last three seasons and as a Hollywood veteran, I know  when a series goes on too long the staff starts looking for things to keep it interesting.  Frankly as soon as I saw that they were going to kill off one half of a just-budding love affair, I disengaged.  Reviews should have a spoiler alert and a warning: Do not bother with this show unless you are willing to get a few gut punches after you are well and truly invested.",1370476800,5,1269,4.563876651982379

I don't know where Season 4 is going to take me but I can't imagine it will get better as I don't see the previous father coming back.  That would be the only thing that would make Season 4 better.

Too much of Brian Quigley and his startups to get rich.  Something better has got to happen for me to go on with Season 5.  It's gotten tired and the remaining actors do not draw my interest.",1367452800,,655,4.134920634920635

1364434,5,B00004WG4J,"We recently discovered this gem about a rural Irish village. Originally it was anchored around a new priest in town but life centers on a pub and its regulars. While humorous the series does not flinch from the awkward and unpleasant facts of life--the property, the complications of drinking and of romance. Unlike idyllic views of rural life it shows the grudges and lack of privacy. In also shows the changes in the Catholic Church in Ireland and the role of the Church in Irish life. The series was made in the late 90s.

In spite of its willingness to tackle these issues, it is a humorous and uplifting series. Try two or three episodes and you will be hooked.",1365811200,,666,4.55

1364516,5,B00004WG4J,"Ballykea fans know what happened. Apparently the two lead actors playing Assumpta and Father Peter wanted to leave, and so they were written out in a real traumatic series of events. Niamh takes over the pub after Brian buys it, and a new young priest is assigned. What's the big deal? The series is still great; in fact, in my opinion, it's even better, as opposed to when it was focused on the relationship between the sultry but skittish proprietor of Fitzgerald's pub and the conflicted priest. I couldn't ever quite buy the whole premise of Father Peter's strong attraction to Assumpta. Why her? Yes, she was hot and all that, but she was adamant in her rejection of the totality of Christianity and God. I'm no expert, but I am a Catholic, and I know a few ex-priests. I don't know any of them who gave up the priesthood for an atheist or agnostic. Quite the contrary, they seem to have taken up with women of strong faith.

Regardless, without Assumpta and Peter to obsess about, there is adequate time to delve into stories about the many other wonderful and interesting characters in the series: Padraig, Brendan, Eamon, Liam, Donal, Siobhan, Brian, Niamh, Ambrose, Kathleen. And of course, compelling new characters enter, most notably Sean Dillon and daughter Emma.

The greatness of the series is due to the intimacy and beauty of the surroundings, the depth of the characters, the fascinating language and the full gamut of human emotions, all of which are presented so artfully in each and every episode.

Some of the shock proved to me just how connected I had become with the characters. I found myself swept away in the emotion. So much so that I was still thinking about it a few days later. This rarely happens with anything I see on television. What is amazing to me is how much has been conveyed throughout the series without being said. This is a credit to the actors, writers, and directors.

Also, the relationships that are depicted seem so much more real than so much of what I see on American television. I traveled to a small town in Ireland and lived there about a month while I was student teaching. Ballykissangel always mentally takes me back there. It is about community. The characters have depth and richness. It is particularly small town. It is particularly Irish. Wonderful.

I had caught a few episodes on PBS, but then started the series at the beginning. I am glad I watched it in order.

It is almost impossible not to be affected by the scene in Niamh & Ambrose's kitchen when Peter relays his Polar Bear analogy to Assumpta - just one of the all time great scenes in TV - perfectly acted, perfectly written(complete with some terrific background orchestration during this particular scene). Just brilliant.

Series 1 ignited our interest in Peter and Assumpta as the sparks flew between them. Series 2 gave us many an enticing moment between the two of them and we begged for more. Series 3 however, took the viewers on a path that many did not want to go and resulted in many alternative endings being written by viewers and posted on fansites. Ballykissangel continued for another three series, but for many viewers, it ended with the departure of Stephen and Dervla in this third series. Series 3 remains well written and acted with many delightful and heartwrenching moments, but in contrast to the previous two series it is overall 'heavier', emotionally infuriating, has Stephen and Dervla absent for two episodes and has the most unsatisfactory ending of all time. Having said that, if you've watched Series 1 and 2, you can't not watch Series 3. Sit back and enjoy, then write your own ending!

1364524,3,B00004WG4J,"My family and I were delighted by the first 2.5 seasons of BallyK. It started out, as another reviewer pointed out, as a humorous series about the trials of a young English priest in an Irish village. It was also quite refreshing to see a Catholic priest portrayed in a sympathetic light. However, by the end of Season 3, it felt as though the writers were unable to stand any more positive portrayals of Christianity, and resorted to Father Peter losing his faith in the aftermath of Assumpta's death - a reaction I consider rather unlikely. By the end of Season 3, the series had also swapped its lighthearted feel for a prolonged grimness. This season is definitely not as enjoyable as seasons 1 & 2.",1137801600,23,703,4.587301587301587
1364525,5,B00004WG4J,"It is interesting that I find 16 reviews for series 3, and only a few for series 1 and 2.  I assume most everyone who watched season 3 had also watched the earlier seasons.  This reaction appears to come from the writer killing off Asumpta in such a cruel fashion. Would I have preferred a different ending?  Probably so. I don't think Peter could have lived without Asumpta, that was a done deal. However that was a pretty cruel way to deal with that situation. Still it did bring out some characters as they dealt with the tragedy. I really don't see the third season being notably of less quality than the early seasons.  It just ended with the major tragedy, that is the big difference.  True, the character of Fr. Clifford (Peter) changed as he was torn between his love of Asumpta and his love of being a Priest. And I certainly preferred the old Peter to the anguished one. However the third season brought other characters out, as Asumpta and Fr. Clifford were absent for a number of episodes trying to make some space between each other. Niamh became much more important, and I felt a very appealing character.  Her convincing Peter to perform last rites on Asumpta demonstarted her willingness to take charge when necessary, a quality that was brought out in the third season in other ways as well. If you like PBS type stuff, such as Mystery or English dramas, you will very much enjoy this series I believe.  It would not appeal to a mainstream audience.  Just as PBS does not.  I think that is a good yardstick, if you like watching PBS type stuff, and generally prefer that to most of what you get on mainstream TV, you should like this very much.  This show is not boring, something new is always happening.  I had a hard time turning it off, staying up late to watch episodes.",1135987200,39,1792,4.5
1364526,5,B00004WG4J,"I would disagree with the reviewers who felt season three marked a disappointing downturn in this series.  In fact, I think this season provides the first real opportunity for all the characters to deepen--the first two seasons were characterized by wit and a certain lightness, but at the expense of many in the cast (Donal, Liam, Siobhan and even Niamh) who functioned mainly as stock figures, important only in moving the contrivances of the plot.  The plotlines in season three may have been more straightforward, less intricate (although the baby episode with the return of Father Mac's past was certainly very layered) but they were more natural, more human.  I found that I didn't mind that the ""main"" characters--Assumpta and Peter--were absent for the center of the season.  I was completely drawn into the lives of everyone else in a way I wasn't during the first two seasons.

I've not seen the rest of the series, as I've just joined it as a dvd watcher in the States.  However, I'm curious and interested to watch Ballykissangel continue, despite the departure of two very important figures--there are many more who intrigue me just as much.",1134604800,13,1154,4.922680412371134

1364530,4,B00004WG4J,"I've been a fan of this show since the late '90s and am thrilled that it's finally been released on DVD.  While the first two series were superb, as others have noted, the third series is lacking in some respects. Many episodes in S3 are fantastic and I enjoyed seeing several secondary characters get their days in the sun.  For example, we see more of Ambrose's police work, Niamh mellows out considerably, Padraig's ex-wife returns, Brendan and Siobhan get an interesting storyline and a secret from Father Mac's past is revealed.

However, Assumpta and Father Clifford are MIA for several episodes and when they return, their characters are often angsty and irritated.  Do they have some redeeming moments? Yes, but the fact that both Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan are ready to leave is evident in their performances.

While the final two episodes will knock your socks off, they sadly are the death knell (in more ways than one) of this once-great series.  Kieran Prendiville also departed at the end of S3 and thus series 4 and 5 took a nosedive.

If you are a fan of Series One and Two, I would definitely recommend buying this DVD--but you should probably stop here.",1128470400,24,1181,4.788177339901478

1364532,4,B00004WG4J,"Unfortunately the special feature on ""Ballykissangel: Complete Series One"" gave away from happened at the end of Series Three, so I have the (dis)advantage of watching these episodes knowing what the payoff was going to be.  That made me acutely aware of how things were being set up, although what I really noticed was how much these Series Three episodes avoided dealing with what was coming.  Unfortunately, in doing so the series got it away from what made it so charming, having ""outsider"" Father Peter Clifford deal with the quaint problems of the locals.  Granted, this allow some of the other characters to emerge more fully, especially Soibhan and Padraig, but Series Three turning out to be such a transitional set of episodes must have surprised fans of the show.

Episode 14, ""As Happy as a Turkey on Boxing Day"" (Written by Barry Devlin, First aired December 21, 1997), offers complications at Christmas time.  Peter has a roommate in Timmy, who is not only Father Mac's nephew but about to be ordained, while Bryan is desperate to avoid Ambrose's mother.  Meanwhile, Padraig's son, Kevin, falls down a mineshaft and no one knows it.

Episode 15, ""When a Child is Born"" (Written by Devlin, First aired March 1, 1998) Niamh is close to giving birth to her baby and the visit from Imelda, Ambrose's mother, is not helping.  Meanwhile, Kathleen discovers a statue in the church has started to sweat and the faithful flock to BallyK to see the miracle, much to the annoyance of Peter.

Episode 16, ""Changing Time!"" (Written by Rio Fanning, First aired March 8, 1998), has the locals protesting Brian wanting to bulldoze a local beauty spot.  But when Peter and Assumpta are left alone at the protest site one night their conversation leads each to a big decision.

But his problems force Brian to lay off Liam and Donal and while Peter in on retreat, Father Mac decides to prove that he does not need a curate at BallyK.

Episode 19, ""I Know When I'm Not Wanted"" (Written by Niall Leonard, First aired March 29, 1998), starts with Peter coming back to BallyK to discover that his home has been rented out because of Brian's bankruptcy.  It seems the town is upside down and to top it off Assumpta shows up back at the pub married to Leo McGarvey, while a challenge with a rival pub in Cildargan serves as a distraction.

Episode 20, ""Personal Call"" (Written by Felicity Hayes McCoy, First aired April 5, 1998), finds Assumpta and Leo are not getting along, so she starts a woman's group, which does wonders for Niamh but rubs Kathleen the wrong way.

Unfortunately, Ambrose has arrested all of the regulars at Fitzgerald's for drinking after hours.  Peter makes his decision and then has to live with the consequences.

Episode 25, ""Amongst Friends"" (Written by Prediville, First aired May 10, 1998), finds Peter deciding about his future in BallyK.  Meanwhile, not only Leo but also a reporter have shown up in town wanting to know about the relationship between Assumpta and the curate.

The last two episodes stand out from the rest.  If ""Ballykissangel"" was a situation comedy geared down to an hour-long format, then these last two episodes are more like a dramedy.  Certainly things get decidedly more serious.  Unfortunately, while the producers were smart enough not to have the show's theme music play over the end credits of ""The Reckoning,"" they still allowed it to play over the opening credits of the next episode.  To say what happens is shocking would be an obvious understatement, but it is hard not to be affected by the joke Peter tells about the young polar bear.  There was definitely chemistry between Peter and Assumpta, but it is hard not to notice this is a BBC series set in Ireland and conclude that an Anglican audience would read it much differently than a Roman Catholic one.",1124409600,9,5432,4.777301927194861
1364533,1,B00004WG4J,"I can't even say how much I loved this whole series. It's very unusual to really care about the main characters in a sitcom, but Peter and Assumpta really got to me. Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan were fantastic! Which was why I was so furious at the ending. It didn't even fit in with the rest of the series and seemed to me like the writers, or whoever, were trying to get revenge on two actors who wanted to leave the show early. It left me feeling very sad and just.... deflated. I might not have watched it at all if I'd known this was going to happen. Not sure If I'll order the fourth series when it comes out, or not. I'm curious as to what happens to some of the other characters, but I'm not sure it's worth it.",1116806400,17,727,4.126760563380282
1364534,2,B00004WG4J,"After the terrific first two seasons this was a huge disappointment. Peter apparently underwent a personality transplant and spent most of the season whining and feeling sorry for himself (when he wasn't out of town). The  other characters were just going through the motions, and the stories lacked the life and spark of the two previous seasons. The ending was cheap and manipulative. The whole series is spoiled for me now. I won't even be able watch the first two seasons again with any enjoyment.",1112486400,11,501,4.894117647058824
1364535,4,B00004WG4J,"I started watching Ballyk in the middle of Season 5 and was hooked though I was only able to watch the episodes haphazardly in my pre-TIVO days.  When the series started being released on DVD, I picked up my copies and watched the first two seasons for the first time and became a fan.  I recently picked up the third season and was a little disappointed.  Overall the episodes were great.  However, I felt that Stephen Tompkinson's character, Father Peter Clifford, went from being very likeable to somewhat painful to watch.  His feelings for Dervla Kirwan's character, Assumpta Fitzgerald, reasonably explains some of this change.  However, I wonder if he was just getting tired of the series.  In the end, both Dervla and himself wanted to leave the series after Season 3 and this resulted in a very abrupt ending.  I believe that adding one or two episodes may have eased the transition to Season 4 and would have produced a more satisfying ending.  However, the ending was quite thought provoking which cannot be said of many series.  If you are a fan of the series, you will not want to miss this collection of episodes on DVD.  If you know nothing about the series, start with Season 1 and work your way through.  I think you will get hooked as I was.  On a technical note, I was disappointed in the lack of extras other than a cast bio.  That and Tompkinson's performance on the later half of the episodes resulted in my 4 star rating.",1111881600,20,1444,4.5680933852140075

1364537,3,B00004WG4J,"I'm Irish and I know that all their wars are merry and all their songs are sad, etc., etc., but this is ridiculous.  This was a wonderful series until they decided to blow it up and take a completely different tack than the one that originally attracted people to it. i.e., the story of a young English priest in a small Irish village. And until the last episode of this series, they did a great job telling that story.  The characters were well-defined and well acted and the humor and quirkiness definitively Irish, but the center of the whole thing was the English--accent on English-- priest and when he disappeared, as far as I was concerned, the whole series collapsed, particularly in light of the way in which the two central characters were dispatched. If Kirwan and Tomkinson wanted to leave, surely the writers could have come up with a better, less abrupt and disappointing way to allow them to do it.  At any rate, it was great while it lasted but the episodes that followed this series were an awful letdown, even with the appearance of Colin Farrell and several other interesting Irish actors here and there.",1109376000,65,1123,4.661616161616162
7925126,3,B00004WG4J,"I enjoyed S1 and S2 immensely, but in S3 the writers seem to lose their minds and instead of a nice little community story, they gave us a soap operaish slightly slimey relationship between the married bar owner and the local priest.  Father Clifford's childish simpering around Assumpta and then his whining and crying at her too-predictable death was offputting and unbelievable. We already know he had blurred the lines with another female, played by Lena Heady in S1, so he should have known to keep his boundaries intact.  Falling for the sharp tongued and not very likeable Assumpta was completely out of character.  Also, he should have been too busy as the only priest in the parish to be spending so much time in that pub. Epi 11 was badly done all around.",1508889600,3,765,4.6940298507462686
