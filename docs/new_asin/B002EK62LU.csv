8367806,5,B002EK62LU,"This DVD is inspiring and got me started on the raw food path. The food is simple, beautiful, and delicious and Minh and Ronnie are delightful to watch and listen to. Everything I've made from this DVD has been wonderful! Many thanks to these lovely people.",1250640000,6,257,4.608695652173913
8367807,5,B002EK62LU,"This DVD, ""The Art of Living Food"", is beautifully produced, and the recipes are clearly and gracefully presented.  I like the way it begins with an emphasis on simplicity and moves to more complex dishes. Perhaps as important as the valuable guidance on preparing raw food is the serenity that Ronnie and Minh both express. They validate my hope that a raw food lifestyle will yield that supreme benefit: more inner peace.",1248998400,7,423,4.875
