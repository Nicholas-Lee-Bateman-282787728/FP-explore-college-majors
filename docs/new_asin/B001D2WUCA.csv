3523303,3,B001D2WUCA,"Where did the information come from that Season Two will have uncut episodes?

There's information from Shout now that the set runs 900 minutes.  Since there were 37 episodes in Season Two, that comes to 24 1/2 minutes per episode, and half-hour series in those days ran 26 minutes.

It could be worse, though, because they're including an episode of ""Window on Main Street,"" so if the 900 minutes includes that, that comes to 23 1/2 minutes per episode, which looks like syndication prints to me.",1219276800,4,497,4.755813953488372
3523304,5,B001D2WUCA,"It is great news to have it verified that the entire Season 2 of Father Knows Best will contain only uncut episodes.  I'm glad it will also contain Stage to Yuma (episode 40) which is never shown in syndication.

I hope the season 3-6 releases will also include only the uncut versions of each episode. In addition, since the season one release by Shout Factory contained at least 14 edited, syndicated episodes, I strongly recommend that as part of the bonus material included in the release of seasons 3-6, that each of those seasons contain complete uncut versions of 3 to 4 of the episodes that were the syndicated versions in the season one release. This would be an excellent way to provide the fans with the complete uncut version for every episode of Father Knows Best. I hope bonus material in a future season release will also include the original pilot episode for the series.",1217376000,8,887,4.67948717948718
3523305,5,B001D2WUCA,"Shout Factory and the family of Robert Young and estate of Eugene Rodney should all be given kudos for listening to our wishes for ""Uncut"" episodes of this classic slice of Americana- Father Knows Best!  Sony also deserves credit for co-operating with Shout Factory in searching in Sony's vaults to be able to present the Season 2 set in complete uncut episodes! This is GREAT news that should be greeted by all of the fans of this show with applause and pre-orders for this set!

Bravo to Shout Factory, Robert Young's family, the estate of Eugene Rodney and Sony!",1217289600,35,565,4.696969696969697

3523365,5,B001D2WUCA,"Transfer over to DVD is pretty good quality.  I thought I would purchase a few of these seasons of the show.  As I explained in my review of the first season and many of my DVD collections I value the Special Feature sections of some of the actors who are still alive and can talk about the show or some of the other actors who are deceased.  The young girl in the show who portrayed Kathy talks about how nice Robert Young was to her in the show.  I guess he had 4 children of his own in real life.  The actress who played Kathy was hired, she thought, because her looks were similar to Robert Young's youngest daughter who's name happened to be Kathy.  But the antics of the Anderson family in Springfield continues and everyone in the family except the Father seems to know that Father Doesn't always know best!",1438992000,2,814,4.322368421052632
3523446,5,B001D2WUCA,"""Father Knows Best"" is a good show and is a warm family comedy that gives lessons to children like in the episode ""Bad Influence"" where Bud (played by Billy Gray) has a friend Artie (played by Guest star Lee Ericson) who keeps giving Bud gifts. The teenager learned you can't buy friendship by giving gifts and buying things for people that he was liked and was a friend because he liked him and he didn't have to buy his friendship by giving him expensive gifts. The acting is superb by all in the show. Another episode ""The Big Test"" had Bud bring home his report card from school with the grade D and how he studied and got the highest grade in school and how the teacher thought he couldn't have done this without cheating though Bud proved he was smart and had studied and the lesson from the episode was showing teenagers they could learn if they study they would do better in school. Elinor Donahue plays the older sister Betty and Lauren Chapin plays the youngest daughter Kathy. Jane Wyatt and Robert Young play the Mother and Father in the show. The Anderson family are a very Loving and kind family. They show how to be a good person and a friend and being kind and considerate of others. We needs shows like this now.",1436486400,,1229,4.418502202643172

But after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did!  The 2nd Season is not at all like the editing of the 1st Season.  I guess SHOUT read the reviews of dozens of dissatisfied customers and decided to fire their editor.

Father didn't always know best, but he did know when he made a mistake and faced up to it.  its all about family, no matter how difficult it can be, he demonstrated gratefulness, patience and the values of having that family.  it was a show pointing toward lessons, entertainment and fun.  a Family show that you can sit and watch with your kids.  its a show for everyone.

Some of the episodes are a little bit out of character of the main theme.  Perhaps that is due to different writers doing different episodes; but generally they are consistent.

Also, for some reason my students have been asking me all kinds of questions about what it was like when I was growing up in the 50's and 60's.  I took these to school and let my students watch on special days.  THEY LOVE THEM.  I was not expecting that result, but now they actually ask to see them.",1329868800,,549,3.9454545454545453

3523676,3,B001D2WUCA,"Go back in time, when life was simpler (or seemed to be), as always, Robert Young is excellent, he always was in any part he played. Jane Wyatt is top notch, but where did they dig up the actors who played the children? Elinor Donohue was so bad, I wince at her acting, she also was bad when she was on the first season of the Andy Griffith Show. To make matters worse, the writers made Betty appear to a moron with no sense.

Bud was okay, I suppose. But when I watch Kathy, I want to slap her. When kids grew up in the fifties, a child who behaved like Kathy does would be disciplined, and unable to sit down until she obeyed her parents. Ironically, she was a good little actress, but she played a brat. As I said, I like this series, but I doubt I'll hold my breath until all seasons are released.",1253577600,,801,4.101910828025478

3523725,5,B001D2WUCA,Season Two arrived today. I watched the episode Kathy Makes Magic. Its great. Uncut with fine video and audio. Much improved over the quality of Season One. As many times as I've seen this episode it was a real treat seeing scenes I'd never seen before.,1226275200,22,253,4.521739130434782
3523726,5,B001D2WUCA,"I used to watch this every morning & again late afternoons during the mid 1980s on The CBN Cable Network which was a channel that once showcased the finest vintage sitcoms ever.

I watched Bachelor Father, Dobie Gillis & Father Knows Best everyday & had my video machine going to put 'em all on tape. As a result I've got loads of Father Knows Best episodes & have even transferred some to DVD as the show hadn't been yet made available on DVD, so my homemade DVDs were something to tide me over anyway.

I'm very pleased to see the series finally get the DVD treatment. I, like some of the others am displeased & think it unfortunate that some of these are syndicated prints. However, as this is a true rarity & has been scarce in rerun markets over the years, I'll gladly take the first & second season & every & any additional seasons that become available in the future. Episodes of Father Knows Best in any DVD offering, syndicated and/or otherwise is better than not having it in any form at all. Sure, I'd love having the completely unedited prints same as many others who have griped about this, but if the syndicated are the majority of prints available in this set, then so be it. They will due until some distributor makes the unedited ones available. For the time being, I'm satisfied.

Some of my favorite episodes were the one where Kathy played a sleuth to unravel a mystery, the one where Kathy is a real tomboy & in the closing scene she makes a grand entrance to her date in a lovely dress. The one where Kathy takes a friend's baby sister & wants to be her mother which had been in one of the earlier shows.

Betty awaiting word on her boyfriend, the jet pilot, Betty being a snob to Bud around her friends, the christmas show which featured Wallace Ford as Santy. Great, great episodes. These plots had morals & The Andersons are a staple of 1950s middle class wholesome americana.

I also LOVED Father Knows Best: Home For Christmas, one of the two reunion movies of 1977 (hadn't seen the previous one, Father Knows Best Reunion).

I thought Billy Gray (Bud) was so cute & endearing as he had gotten into his upper teens!

Elinor Donahue (Betty) was so down-to-earth & upbeat & had some of the most comical one-liners in some of the earlier episodes where she'd make a sharp-witted remark about Bud to Father! She also had a warm & bright smile that was remarkable.

Lauren Chapin (Kathy) was everyone's favorite half-pint tomboyish kid sister who at times felt neglected & was always there with a shoulder. I bought Lauren Chapin's Father Does Know Best autobiography back when it was first released & am proud to have it in my library of favorite publications/memorabilia. I empathize with all she's overcome & the inner strength & determination that got her through it in the long run. We LOVE you, Lauren!

Jim & Margaret were there with words of wisdom & instilled values in their children which is timeless & makes this show appropriate for kids of all ages. It's also clean & inoffensive & makes the grade as a classic worth having in your DVD library of really good 1950s family sitcoms. I'm an avid fan of the vintage radio series as well!",1226275200,2,3169,4.526223776223776
3523727,5,B001D2WUCA,"Here it is: the best season (in my opinion) of FATHER KNOWS BEST, with a wonderful DVD release.  Every episode is complete, from the opening titles right through the ""Screen Gems"" logo at the end.  They run close to 26 minutes each!

Video and audio quality is excellent.  A few episodes even include the original sponsor cards during the opening/closing credits.

Why is this the best season?  Everything clicks here: acting, writing, direction, music -- the sometimes silly storylines that permeated the first half of the first season are gone, and this second season more than builds on the momentum of the end of the first season (when the show was starting to get a lot more interesting).

Lots & lots of classic episodes here, including:

* ""Advantage to Betty"" (Betty doesn't play tennis as well as the team champ, but gets more attention from the press because she's prettier)

* ""Persistent Guest"" (Bud's homeless friend visits and won't leave)

* ""Family Reunion"" (No one wants to go to Margaret's family's reunion -- except Margaret)

* ""Father, the Naturalist"" (Kathy loses her Little Squaws nature folder in the woods)

There are very nice bonus features, too: a ""flashback"" episode from the final season, another episode of ""Window on Main Street,"" more interviews with Elinor Donahue and Lauren Chapin, and the long-missing ""Stage to Yuma"" Western episode that fans have been seeking for years.  (The version of ""Stage to Yuma"" presented here is pristine, unlike the underground copies that have been floating around for awhile.)

I'm delighted that Shout! put so much love & care into this FATHER KNOWS BEST set, and recommend it highly.",1225411200,27,1653,4.985401459854015

3523729,5,B001D2WUCA,"I help maintain the fatherknowsbest.com website, and i just want to stop the uncertainity whether or not the season 2 dvds are complete.  They are complete with each episode running about 26 minutes.  There are no music alterations (like they did to ""the Fugitive"" or ""My Three Sons"".)  The Screen Gems logo is on the ending credits, and some episodes have the sponsor opening and closing credits, things true fans love to see.  The episodes came from uncut masters from the Sony Vaults.  It is 50 years old, and originally was on film, so you will get the occasional specks that film has, but the overall picture is so sharp you can actually see the nail marks on some walls! This DVD set is about as close to perfection as you can get.  (Minor flaws: the expanded version of ""First Disillusionment"" doesn't have the opening credits, and they used 1st season episode photos in the menus of the DVDs). For most everyone who watched the series in the past 25 years, we only got 22 minutes of each episode, so to see the full 26 minutes is a real treat!
