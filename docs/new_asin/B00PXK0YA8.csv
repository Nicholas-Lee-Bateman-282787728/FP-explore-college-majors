8689726,3,B00PXK0YA8,"The movie plays well, the footage is clean and the sound is good. Sadly, there are no extra features, at all. The 2004 DVD 2 disc set had a second disc of extra features that could have been added onto this Blu Ray and they are nowhere to be seen.

Things like the original trailer, cast interviews and commentary (one of the last things Buddy Hackett did before his passing) have all been omitted in this release. Unless you are a stickler for video quality, this reissue doesn't have much to offer.",1470528000,4,500,4.434782608695652
8689727,5,B00PXK0YA8,I like this version  over the dvd version  because  there were not any black spots  in the movie. The color  of the  format of picture  is pretty much hd. I would  recommend  this  to anyone. All smiles here.,1461888000,,208,4.2368421052631575

8689730,3,B00PXK0YA8,"The Love Bug isn't exactly a Disney classic. It's enjoyable, but largely forgettable and lacking the production values the very best of Disney's live action output from the 1950's and 60's had. Still, you can't go wrong with Buddy Hackett. The antiseptic romance is fairly dull, but 'Herbie' livens things up as only an inanimate object, imbued with a sense of the supernatural could. This Blu-ray transfer is problematic. It's soft, on occasion, almost out of focus. The razor-sharp crispness we've come to expect from hi-def is decidedly lacking. Part of the problem is owed to imperfect elements. But contrast herein looks a tad boosted to my eyes; the colors a tad overly bright and the grain exaggerated beyond what it ought to be. In some scenes its barely visible while in others it decidedly distracts. Inconsistencies aside, this isn't a terrible Blu-ray. But it has a long way to go to rate a perfect score. The seller was great. You can buy with confidence.",1424476800,,968,4.872727272727273
8689731,2,B00PXK0YA8,"The Love Bug was the biggest box office hit of 1969 and at that time, Disney Studios' biggest moneymaker since Mary Poppins came out in 1964.  I along with many have loved Herbie, the Love Bug since childhood and over the years, waited for a newly remastered copy of the film to be released along with a new collection of bonus features.  In the year 2003 we got just that; a brand new 2-Disc Special Edition of The Love Bug on DVD to enjoy for many years to come.

With the arrival of Hi Definition film and BluRay, I and many of my fellow fans hoped that one day Disney Home Video would put The Love Bug out on the new format, chock full of all the amazing bonus features that were on its DVD counterpart and much more newly produced features that even the fans could possibly participate in...

But we did not receive this...

Instead, what we got was this 'Disney Bluray Exclusive' title that can only be ordered as part of the Disney Movie Club program.  Now I was fortunate enough to purchase this title brand new from a member that bought an extra copy and was highly anticipating a great newly remastered presentation both of sight and sound, even though I was aware that the Bluray would contain no special bonus features.  That's right folks, you read correct, The Love Bug 'Disney Bluray Exclusive' does NOT contain ANY of the bonus features that were on the 2003 2-Disc DVD release so, DO NOT throw it away or sell your copy!

Now then...onto my review, and I actually recorded these notes while watching the film so it'll basically contain a scene-by-scene commentary.

When you start the film, it appears that the opening credits have been given a complete restoration.  This is the first time, from what I could see, where the opening credit color was truly standing out in bright white.  If you were never able to read these credits easily before, then you'll be able to read them clear as crystal now.

I hate to say this, but the picture quality and sound appears to be highly darkened.  It doesn't look as bright as previously released versions featured on both DVD AND VHS reissues.  It appears almost as if the bluray producers just took an old 35mm transfer and just blew up the frame for a widescreen presentation.  The sound really doesn't seem to have been enhanced, even though it is listed as 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio.  One would think this means that with a sound bar (which I had turned on and up fairly high), the music/dialogue/sound effects would really blast through in the presentation, but they don't.

Going back to the discussion of picture quality, the film has definitely become darker on this bluray presentation.  I'm not sure if this was done to bring out flesh tones for a nice balance, but it's definitely NOT the quality of the DVD that was released over 10 years ago.  There is some excessive graininess and many scenes in the film have ""noise"" if you will, on certain items of clothing characters wear like Tennessee's shirt during the scene where he tells his philosophy on machines starting to think for themselves.  The only item that ever seems to be ""popping out"" on the screen is Jim Douglas' blue race helmet which allows you to really see the individual sparkles when he wears it.

One scene in particular that I found to be just completely ""washed out"" in its appearance was the driving sequence of Carole and Jim in the Thorndyke Special (""Without a real car, I'm only half a man"").

As I continued watching, I just found myself saying ""Dark...dark...dark! It just looks incredibly dark!""  Especially when we see Tennessee and Thorndyke drinking their Irish coffee and Thorndyke accidentally squirts some whipped cream onto Tennessee's hand.

During the Irish coffee sabotage race at Riverside, this sequence really did stand out for me sound wise.  It seems the audio is given top notch presentation when you listen to it.  But this enjoyment lasts only for so long, for as we continue to the scene where Carole comes to try and fix Herbie after the race, due to the darkness of the picture, the eye shadow she has on makes her look almost scary!

Peter Ellenshaw's famous matte paintings from the film still stand out quite beautifully when Jim goes looking for Herbie.  Even on this bluray they look amazing even if after all this time in watching The Love Bug, you're fully aware that they are just paintings and not real.

I also discovered a little bit a trivia or ""watch this closely"" factoid that I never noticed before.  In the time that Herbie ran away from Jim, he apparently got quite a lot of dirt and grime on him, because when Thorndyke tells his men to ""Grab the brute"", and Herbie backs up towards them, one of the men actually wipes away dust next to Herbie's fender revealing a brighter patch of white paint as he grabs onto the car.

Now onto more critique about the picture presentation that's so bad it was beginning to hurt me both physically AND emotionally!

The scene with the Chinese dragon looked so blurry as though it were stock footage, that I wanted to close my eyes because it was hurting to look at it.

I understand by the time Herbie's about to commit suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge, he looks terrible, shattered, gloomy, and just run-down...but due to the darker quality of the picture, he looks so bad that I felt like crying watching this sequence.  Like I felt that Disney went out of their way to make sure that even for a new Bluray release, Herbie looked particularly pitiful in this sequence.

One random observation I made while watching, was that Chick Hearn, the late sportscaster who played the announcer of the El Dorado race looked particularly great on the bluray.  Almost as if he never aged!  He is missed amongst us fans.  Good to see his image preserved here at least.

Ironically, for me the best looking sequence of the whole bluray is the final scene where Jim and Carole get into Herbie and take off for their honeymoon.  That is the best looking scene in the entire bluray presentation of The Love Bug...the LAST SCENE.

So what else can I say about this?  Well, it's time to be blunt, Disney really doesn't care about their classic live action films the way they used to.  Now in today's era of family films, their target audience of kids really doesn't reflect on what was considered ""Fun"" over 45 years ago, and that's sad.  Now-a-days you have kids loving anything that's animated (be it computer or hand drawn) and hating everything that's live-action.  Disney's greatest achievement this past year was Frozen, a computer animated film that made over 400 million dollars at the box office. Now, it seems quite clear with what's happening at Disney parks and with the home video market, that they just don't want to invest in it anymore.  Even Disney's Hollywood Studios (formerly MGM Studios) is being overhauled and the entire backlot tour area where an original Herbie once stood is being demolished from the park completely to make room for a rumored Pixar Themed amusement park.

It is very sad that Disney just doesn't care anymore about these great classics the way we the fans do.  It seems that if anything, the only live-action films of yesteryear that Disney ever cares about reissuing again year after every few years is their Live-Action/Animation hybrid trio; Mary Poppins, Bedknobs & Broomsticks, and Pete's Dragon.  Why?  Because to Disney, this is what sells to kids...never mind the fact that it's primarily a Live-Action film, if it contains a good 5-10 minutes of animation, then kids will love it and beg their parents to buy it on DVD/Bluray for them.

A reviewer posted online recently about the Disney All-Star Movies resort in Orlando, Florida where 5 buildings themed after Disney movies stand (Fantasia, Toy Story, The Mighty Ducks, 101 Dalmatians, and The Love Bug).  The reviewer's title was 'Do kids even know who Herbie, the Love Bug is?', and sadly nothing could be further from the truth.  They don't.

Disney just doesn't care about things of the past unless they contain animation for little kids to love and cherish for years to come.  Unfortunately what us fans were hoping for, a truly remarkable remastering of The Love Bug and the opportunity to contribute and participate in newly produced bonus features didn't happen and looks like it will never happen unless we take it upon ourselves to produce it on our own.

So for this, I can only give this release 2 stars.  Poor quality and a severe lack of dedication and pride.  I guess they ran out of pride when they ran out of cars, right?  I really can only recommend this for Herbie home video completists like myself; those who want to own Herbie movies on every format of home video be it VHS, Beta, Laserdisc, Videodisc, and DVD.  At this point, I now have very low expectations of how Herbie Rides Again will look like on Bluray as I'm going to be reviewing that soon as well.

So to all of you Herbie fans reading this, 'caveat emptor' as Mike Brady says...'let the buyer beware' and hopefully my review has given you all a major eye opener.  Let us hope that we the fans are the ones who'll keep the spirit of Herbie, the Love Bug going for ourselves and not just from what the company that created him puts out at random.",1417219200,21,9242,4.63943488943489
