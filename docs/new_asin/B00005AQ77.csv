In this 60 minute video, Glen Velez provides a relaxed and clear presentation for learning the basic strokes and techniques of  several frame drums.  The video primarily focuses on the  Irish Bodhran and the Arabic  Riq and Tar. Velez does not emphasize the numerous traditional rhythms of each instrument, but explores the tonal colors and creative possibilities that could be applied to almost any frame drum. He demonstrates the basic tones and ornamentation on the Bodhran, Riq and Tar. After an introduction to the respective instrument, he gives a superb solo.  In addition, the video begins and ends with a stellar performance by both Glen Velez and Layne Redmond.  The video also includes a concise manual of the rhythms and concepts presented. This video would be a valuable addition to the library of  any  serious percussionist. Suitable for beginner to advanced levels.
