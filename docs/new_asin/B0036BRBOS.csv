Helicopters,What is wrong with the Asylum ?,They must hate helicopters,Or have past bad Ju-Ju about being trapped by Volcano Ash in airports in Belize or why,Why pick on the poor helicopters...A necessary prop in most B-films since day one of drive-ins.
Tiffany- OK sister you pulled this performance out of some orifice,Thanks.
Paul Logan-So,Next time you'll have even more to do as you take over `The Expendable' job of Action Hero.

4075837,2,B0036BRBOS,"I'm one for hokey and cheap ""icky bug"" movies, but this one has been the worst I've seen in a long time. The special effects were cheesy, the acting atrocious, and the plot simple and by the numbers. The only thing wrong at first glance was that they didn't curse a lot and there were no naked chicks that had nothing to do with the plot.

Despite all, I had a good time laughing at the movie. I didn't know at the time, but the writer/producer is in the movie and dies horribly near the beginning. Kind of a Hitchcock/Shyalaman thing. The hero does the macho thing to the hilt. His muscles bulge so much he can't touch his sides, and he struts around in a very macho ""hero"" kind of way. His acting wasn't that bad, but his ""posing"" was hammed up a bit and over the top.

Tiffany did a halfway decent job as the love interest, however you don't even know she's the actual love interest (except for being the only female in the movie) until the final scene. Huh?

The big problem is the end and how they kill the icky bugs, which are actually giant aggressive Piranhas. What they do to try and kill them is one thing. However, the way they finally accomplish it is so ludicrous, not to mention ""unfinished"" that you are likely to throw something at the TV set. As much as I love cheesy monster movies, when they kill the beasts in the end, there is at least a tad of logic to it. In this case, even stretching the imagination, there is no way they could have killed them all off. I won't say how, but when you get to the end, if you think I'm wrong, let me know why in the comments.

The science is completely out the window, but that is to be expected with this type of movie. I go into them expecting that, and frankly, not caring. I know enough about things to be able to tell when something is scientifically impossible and have no problem rolling with it. In this case, there was not even a modicum of real physics or real science. That is not the intent of these movies anyway, and is one reason I enjoy them so much.

I am giving it two stars because it was at least cheesy and ridiculous entertainment all the way until the final confrontation. I don't think it deserves more stars because even though there were parts of the ending I liked, it made no sense whatsoever and ruined what could have been a decent Saturday afternoon icky bug movie. Usually these movies are better than this. I could blame it on editing, except the whole premise of the ending was wrong to begin with. No amount of editing could have made a difference unless they changed the basic principle behind the final confrontation. Not recommended.",1271030400,4,2627,4.33130081300813

This time by boat, including women, bearing their enormous, frontal-flotation devices! Don't put those in the water! AAAARRRG!! The CGI piranhas sink the boat! Enter Secretary of State, Johnny Bravo, who contacts Special Forces Operative / Male Model, Jason Fitch. Meanwhile, Professor Tiffany, who developed the monster-fish, is having post-genetic-tampering regrets. Fitch heads to the Amazon -where no one smiles, ever!- for answers. Much grimacing commences. Fitch is stonewalled by local military types, but he has a plan, involving his wearing black clothes, which apparently make him invisible. In Washington, Greg Brady wants results, dammit! Little does he know, the fish are growing at an astounding rate! Tiffany said so! Simultaneously, Fitch fends off the finny fiends w/... a knife! I told you he was Special Forces! They could take on a swarm of giant killer bees w/ nothing but a pine cone and grain of rice! Fitch teams up w/ Tiffany for a duet of doom against the killer cartoon creatures! The military, tired of waiting, sends in CGI-copters and bombs the Amazon. BOOM! Secretary Johnny Bravo is ecstatic. Uh oh! The soldiers take over Tiffany's lab! More fishy deaths occur. Greg Brady wears his unhappy face. The piranhas have attained school bus size! And! They! Fly! Fitch fights them off w/ his feet! Time to bomb another river! It would be difficult to track the piranhas, if they didn't pop out of the water like dolphins as they swim. BOOM! BOOM! Dear lord! Can nothing stop these gargantuan bits of computer memory, before they reach Florida? Oh, Greg Bravo, please let Fitch use his ludicrous idea! It's brilliantly, impossibly stupid! Oh, please allow him to lead an assault on the monster fish w/ his seal team! Glory be! Tiffany gives Fitch some parting advice. Yes, I think they're alone now. In the meantime, it's piranha-nado! This movie is beyond description! Beyond adjectives! Possibly, beyond time and space! ADDED MIRACLE BONUS: Tiffany sings on the soundtrack!...",1512345600,4,2181,5.1120448179271705

4075869,2,B0036BRBOS,"Released in 2010, Mega Piranha chronicles events when a mutant strain of increasingly-growing piranha escape from the Amazon Basis to threaten Florida. Tiffany stars as a researcher in the jungle while Paul Logan plays a kick-axx government agent and Barry Williams his superior back in the US. David Labiosa is on hand as a Hispanic militant in the jungle.

While a little overweight, Tiffany makes for a likable protagonist and Logan is spot-on as a Rambo-ish action figure. The jungle and beach locations are good and theres quite a bit of action. Unfortunately, the story isn't very compelling, although it develops some drive by the last act. But its all for naught as the cartoony CGI of the huge piranha and what they're able to do makes you bust out laughing rather than scare you (or impress you or whatever). As the story moves along, the colossal fish are shown jumping into water thats obviously too shallow for them to occupy. It just boggles my mind that The Asylum would blow all this money on cast and locations and then plague the flick with such lousy F/X. One worthy brief scene occurs during the beginning, however, when Tiffanys character amusingly pays tribute to the great Apocalypse Now, which will be missed by most viewers because its not one of the more popular lines from that movie. Speaking of Tiffany, she sings the end-credits song Frozen Skies and its pretty good.

Bottom Line: Even viewed as a parody, ""Mega Piranha"" is bad, Mega Bad.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Belize, Los Angeles and Long Beach.

4075901,3,B0036BRBOS,"I realize this movie is not meant to be taken too seriously, but I think it could have been a lot better if the creators took it just a little bit more seriously.  The movie is actually not horrible, but there are a few moments of horrible acting and other non-sensical things.  Why is the Venezualian military so hell-bent on capturing the scientists when they have the huge-piranha crisis on their hands which they seem to not be concerned with?  And why are the Venezualian military wearing completely generic uniforms with no markings or rank whatsoever?  Why are the giant piranhas all jumping out of the water suicidally into buildings?  Why are the Navy Seals shooting underwater weapons at them for 10 minutes but fail to do any damage, all the while the piranhas are not attacking them?  And the worst of all in the ending!  The ending is the absolute most anti-climactic letdown I have ever seen.  The premise is if they can draw blood from one of the piranhas, it will create a feeding-frenzy and they will rip eachother to shreds.  They manage to blow up one of the piranhas, but then nothing really happens, and everyone is celebrating.  Movie over.  Huh?!",1359763200,,1169,4.681372549019608
4075902,2,B0036BRBOS,"This is a movie genre called ""bad on purpose"". Of course it is low budget. It's almost designed to be comedy, but without the explicit intentiom to make you laugh or be in the AIRPLANE or TOP SECRET vein.

The producers gives clues all the time to make you wonder ""how bad is that"", or ""how ludcricouse this extra or special effect is"" or ""how is possible such absurd continuity error""? But it is all on purpose, even the amazing corny lines.

Example 1: our Seal hero and main character is toutrageously wooden face, obviously on purpose (Firch, I think was his name) is in a hot car chase with the bad guys. At the front seat with him is the girl scientist (Tiffany) and at the back seat is another scientist. But, in a lot os shots during the car chase, and I mean clearly visible an explicit shots at broad daylight), Firch is alone in the car. Absolutelyt nobody with him.

Example 2: Firch is batlling the piranhas at the ende of the mvoei, while Tiffany and other top guys from the US governemnt are monitoring it. Ouf of the blue, Tiffany says the wonderful line by the radio: ""Come on baby, you're doung fine!.

Example 3: I could not skip the marvellous becaj scene when a woman is hit by a PIranha at the beach line. Firch runs to her and says: ""Take it wasy, everything will be alright"", and the womans dies the next second. Soon after, Firch is attacked by a bunch of piranhas. He lays back at the sand and fends all of them by kicking them away...

It's all on purpose. It has its fun moments. But, is it worth the minutes you lose of your life watching it? I don't know. I lost mine.",1358985600,,1598,4.2781456953642385

4075904,1,B0036BRBOS,"My teenage son got this straight-to-DVD movie (and Syfy Channel) for my last birthday and 9 months later finally watched it.  Frankly, this could be a 2-pronged test case in film school.  A good argument could be made as to how to make a film with a miniscule budget and still make money.  While there is nothing noteworthy otherwise, there are plenty of moments of unintended laughter.  It kind of reminds me of all those 50's horror films the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" guys made fun of.  They would have a career with this clunker.

With some of the worst acting you will ever see, former teen pop star Tiffany leads the cast as some kind of biologist experimenting on fish in the rivers of Venezuela.  When the American ambassador and the foreign minister are out on a party boat with several local topless ladies, they are attacked by a very aggressive school of piranha.  So aggressive they eat the boat before getting to the good stuff.  The American secretary of state, who acts like he's the secretary of defense, sends in a lone special services agent (Paul Logan) to get things under control.

Logan and Tiffany have about as much chemistry as two piranhas.  Somehow, the genetically modified piranhas are doubling in size every few hours and are headed for Florida.  Along the way, they eat buildings, a guided missile cruiser, a submarine and shake off an atomic bomb.  These dudes are tough, but no match for Fitch (Logan) and some Navy SEALs armed with underwater rifles.  The movie is bad, real bad.",1348099200,2,1519,4.704545454545454
4075905,2,B0036BRBOS,"This movie was in my local Walmart $5.00 bin. I focused on the words, ""Tiffany, nudity and adult situations."" Fortunately the three did not meet. By the time Tiffany gets on the screen, the nudity is over and nothing to write home about. Like the Mega piranha, Tiffany has mutated and gotten huge, move over Sally Struthers. How big was she? She couldn't get raped in a Venezuelan prison. Likewise Paul Logan gives us his most unmemorable performance.

The special effects were so bad, I was crying out for ""Mega Shark"". They had women on nuclear submarines with a control room that looked more like my living room, than an actual submarine control room. The Secretary of State describes the fish as traveling in ""groups"" (not schools). The fish absorb nutrients through the skin, yet jump on to land to eat people. In addition to battling various sizes of poorly generated computer fish, Tiffany and Logan must also battle rogue elements of the Venezuelan army.

4075906,3,B0036BRBOS,"In Mega Piranha, tiny predatory jungle fish are swollen to immense proportions by science. If you wonder why, you are watching the wrong movie. Of course being gigantic also gives the mega piranhas the ability to leap miles over land and into the air, and to make anything they land on (and comically wedge themselves into) explode. If you wonder why, you are once again watching the wrong movie. Since these direct-to-video creature features are more or less totally predictable, I've broken this review into key areas:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Tiffany. You know, the singer from the 80s who did girl-pop covers of songs by older, better musicians then got naked in Playboy when people got sick of hearing her. She's actually pretty good here and brings a touch of quirky irritation to an otherwise by-the-numbers role.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Solid. Man creates giant piranhas for literally no reason, then not even nukes (!) can stop them. I won't give away what DOES stop them, but it's silly.

Carnage:
Outstanding! The way the mega piranhas attack humanity is to launch out of the water and crash into stuff, whereupon they stick out of the landscape wriggling like big, living jarts. This alone isn't super threatening, so they also explode. Or make stuff they hit explode. It's a little unclear. Did I mention the navy tries to nuke the piranhas?

Awful Effects:
Hilarious. As mentioned above, you get to see demolished towns with big cartoony fish wedged into them. Also the navy's secret base is a matte painting of Bio-Dome Photoshopped onto an oil-rig. And when battleships shell the piranhas, they just digitally superimpose muzzle flashes onto the motionless cannons.

Romantic Subplot:
Forgettable. I forgot about it completely. I'm just assuming there is one, because there ALWAYS IS.

Big Action Truck:
Nobody gets a big action truck, instead they get an assortment of action boats. This makes sense when fighting piranhas.

This movie is worth it for the hilarious action sequences, but the rest is as boring as wet toast. Fast forward is your friend during this crushing cinematic ordeal. That said, I still really got a kick out of it. This is probably a sign that I am clinically insane, so you shouldn't listen to my advice too closely.",1344988800,,2260,4.931578947368421

action,terror,explosions. And

happy ending. So do more good
reviews ok.",1334620800,,157,5.076923076923077
4075929,1,B0036BRBOS,"Okay, I will preface this review by saying a few things: You can tell by the cover alone how bad this movie is going to be and may set your standards relatively low. Take those standards and set them considerably lower. Second of all, do not take this movie seriously. And third, do not actually pay money for this atrocity.

Hey, we all love movies where big killer animals run rampant and kill a bunch of people, right? This movie reminded me a bit of Deep Blue Sea...just a bit. Basically what happens is this itty bitty lab in Venezuela (I think) being funded by the U.N. has been experimenting on piranhas and created some kind of super-evolved form. But some of their specimens are either stolen or have escaped and are now breeding in the wild. First you see an idiot woman deciding to swim in an Amazonian river, and she and her boyfriend get pulled under and eaten a la Jaws. Then these piranhas bite through a small boat hard enough to sink it and eat everyone on board (you do get to see some topless chicks before this happens and for some, that may be this movie's only redeeming quality).

So someone involved with the government comes down to South America to investigate the boat incident because some important person was aboard and the Venezuelan government is convinced it's due to terrorist activity, but this agent (Jason Fitch) finds a trio of scientists who explain to him about the fish, how they were responsible for the boat attack and also tells about how the fish are evolving and growing. You learn that these fish will double in size every few hours and that they need to be stopped before they reach the States. The local military decides to shoot the fish to death with bullets and missiles...just blindly firing into the water and assuming they're all being killed. Well crap on a stick, only about 50 fish died and they're going upstream toward the ocean. I can't imagine why just shooting randomly into water wouldn't be enough to kill an entire school of fish, even if they are huge. And they are just plain hilarious to watch when they start wrecking the harbor - these whale-sized fish are hurling themselves out of the water and into buildings. There are many sky shots where you see fish stuck head-first in flaming buildings flailing around. Why would a fish do that? The number of fish were not decimated in any way despite so many making suicide jumps onto land either. In fact, I think as the film went on and the fish got closer to the U.S., they may have multiplied.

Eventually these piranhas reach the Florida Keys and The Secretary of Defense decides to launch a 20 kilo-ton nuclear missile at these fish when the government realizes these massive creatures are moving in too fast. This missile does absolutely nothing to harm these fish and they actually manage to sink the submarine by biting it. Next step is to send Fitch and a bunch of other people in scuba suits into the water with rifles and are told to blow the fish away or shoot them in the eyes. Oh, well, the scientist confirms that the fish's bodies are so strong and evolved that these bullets - which can sink a sub, by the way - cannot penetrate their flesh. So the divers are told to shoot their gills. No good. The fish manage to dodge the bullets too. Eventually a Venezuelan helicopter with the annoying military general becomes fish food when Fitch uses a ""fish whistle"" to call one of the enormous piranhas to actually leap out of the water and grab the aircraft in its mouth. From here, Fitch ducks into a coral reef that the fish cannot get into (but it can crush buildings) and shoots the helicopter until it explodes, blowing the fish's face open. This causes the other piranhas to gang up on the dead one and eat it, and we are supposed to assume they eat each other to death.

Yes, that's how they are killed - nukes don't even scratch them, but they kill one another because one died. The special effects are just funny because they're so bad - several flight scenes looked like a helicopter toy was being dangled in front of the camera lens. Others were just lazy in which the helicopter doesn't even change angle, but manages to do a 90-degree turn. I also love some of the random things the characters do that make no sense at all...like Fitch's phone battery dying and Tiffany (the female scientist) tells him to put it in his mouth for a few minutes to recharge it enough to send an SOS call. Because hey, sticking batteries in your mouth is always a wonderful idea. Or how this same scientist manages to use a tank of oxygen to fuel a helicopter just long enough to get it over the water and land it at a military base. Just...huh?

This is just such a cheesy movie, but it's a TV film, so you can't expect it to be genuinely good. Frankly I though it was horrible, and I wasn't even taking it seriously in the least. The computer animation is atrocious, there's a lot of obvious laziness, and several sequences are shown over and over again. I don't know if this was meant to be a serious film endeavor or not, but if you just go in knowing it's gonna be cheesy as hell, it might be more enjoyable because you're going to be laughing at how awful it is. A fun thing to do with a movie like this is to watch it with friends, mute the volume and add your own improv dialogue. If you watch it while under the influence of any sort of recreational substance, it could very well become a spiritually uplifting experience or maybe you'll discover the answer to one of life's deepest questions. But even if you watch this thing sober, believe me, you're gonna want to drink very shortly after the film begins.",1330732800,5,5638,4.475218658892128
4075930,3,B0036BRBOS,"OMG!!....Funniest movie i've seen in a while!!!  I knew from the start that this movie was probably going to be a little cheesy but not THAT much!!!...My abdomen's muscles are still sore from all the laughs we had!! I hesitated a long time between giving this one 3 or 4 star but i knew i definitely had to review this. I said i would share with people if i was going to be entertained and i was!!!

I finally decided to go with 3 stars, as i like movies with a good plot, good acting and cinematography, this one was a little bit of a letdown on that side so i realise a 4 star rating (which should be almost perfect) was  too much for this movie. Yes the acting is bad, but just like another reviewer said: its so cheesy its good!!! And its true!! I think i never laughed that much while watching a movie before!! This is probably better than any comedy film i've seen in the past few years!!!

When the movie started i notice there was something wrong with the way the actors were playing their role but its only after the 1st 20-25 minutes i realise this was the most cheesiest film i've ever seen. From this point i started to laugh at almost everything the actors were saying and doing......i  just couldn't resist...i  remember we actually had to stop the movie 2 or 3 times after the 1st half hour cause i was laughing too much and was gasping for air!!...lol...and every time i tried to stop laughing and looked up at the screen to keep watching the movie, i just coudn't because everytime, one of the actors was saying something too cheesy or was tryin to look mean and serious and  i just started laughing even more cause it was so bad!!

I actually think it was done this way on purpose and they did a really good job. I'll be checking more of those Asylum movies for a good laugh that for sure...i heard they had lot's of other cheesy movies like this with giant monsters and creatures. I'll be looking into it.

I will not talk about the plot or the special effects more than that cause i don't think its worth it. I would rather leave it as a surprise cause that's what it was for me. I wasn't expected to laugh so hard and it turned out i had such a good time!!! If you don't mind cheesy movies and you wanna have a good laugh then go for it...you'll definitely have a good time!!!! ......3 stars well earned for an hilarious movie....good times!!!!

ENJOY!!!!!",1324944000,,2377,4.297539149888143
4075931,5,B0036BRBOS,"The Asylum and SyFy have done it again. They made another SyFy original movie that not to many enjoy. First off I saw this with my mother when they showed it on TV and she thought it was horrendous and unwatchable. I begged to differ and thought it was pretty funny. The plot of this movie is something of the mind of a 4th grader would make up. A US Ambassador to Venezuela was going on a Boat trip to in the Orinoco River when the boat was attacked by Piranhas. The Venezuelan government thought this was an assassination. The US Government calls in Special Agent Jason Fitch to see what happened. He finds out the boat was attacked by Mega Piranhas that are going to get bigger and bigger and attack.
  Aside from the plot being extremely ridiculous, this movie turns out to be an unintentional comedy. Another thing is that this movie is more enjoyable if you have a bunch of friends over your house for riffing the movie.
Now on to the picture transfer. 10/10. The Picture transfer for this Blu-Ray is actually amazing apart from the movie being a low budget B movie.
The Audio quality is a 10/10. I didn't have to turn the volume up on this movie one bit.

4075932,5,B0036BRBOS,"I sat up late in my living room with insomnia, when this movie came on the sci-fi channel. It was so preposterous that I had an out of body moment until my son came down for a late-night snack. He stopped in front of the TV, and in two minutes he looked at me and said, incredulously: ""Really?"" Then he burst out in deep bass teen testosterone laughter. He went into the kitchen and returned with a huge smorgasbord of leftover bbq ribs, brown rice & red kidney beans, a thick slice of my favorite online vegan ""The World's Best Carrot Cake"", a bag of kettle chips, a banana, a chobani blueberry Greek yogurt, and a 20oz cup of ""low fat"" chocolate milk. He sat down on floor rug watching this crazy movie, eating 20lbs of food at midnight, and looked at me and calmly said: ""movies like this make the case for legalizing marijuana"". If he wasn't a lithe, athletic teenage boy who ate like 5 lumberjacks and 4 pregnant women, several times a day, Id've sent him to Labcorp just on circumstantial evidence.

So, about the story: Genetically Modified Piranha take on everything from a Navy nuclear sub, to a lone wolf martial artist and a lone wolf scientist. They're growing by the minute, went from fresh to salt water, and finally make it to Miami Beach, where they are eating everyone including a news reporter who got swallowed whole, (is that a bad thing?). Suv-sized, juicy, flying, voracious fish stuck in condo windows, 15 stories high, it's hilarious! My son and I laughed so hard, I almost had to do the Heimlich on him with his mouth full of food.

This movie makes me think of the triple feature movies they used to show in the NYC Times Square area when I wad a teen, and we kids would cut class to see them all. The first movie would be an A-rate film like Indiana Jones, the next would be a B-rate, like Fast Times at Ridgemont High or Robocop (this would be Mega Piranha's slot), and the final would be something C-rate & ignorant like Cheech and Chong, or Dolomite (This could also be mega piranah's slot).

This movie cheered me up, and made a great bed-time story. Everyone involved in this movie, from the writer, producer, director, actors, etc. must've been smoking some serious stuff to put this movie out.",1315094400,3,2227,4.493827160493828
4075933,5,B0036BRBOS,"What more could you want in an all-star cast. A bubble-gum pop star from the 80's who is aging right along with those who know who she is. That's right, Tiffany, saw you standing there, and then you were eaten by a fish the size of a house, and it's all her fault.  And if that is not vintage enough for you, here's the story ... Greg Brady.. err... I mean Bob Grady as Secretary of State.  Barry Williams as the equivalent of Hillary Clinton in this role is just a bunch of fun.  And then we have the leading man with the most talented abs I've never seen before.  That's right, Paul Logan, best known for his riveting role of ""Joe"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stripper-Wives/dp/B0001XGO1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stripper Wives</a>&nbsp;(Don't worry, I don't know who he is either.)

Freakin' Tiffany screwed up a fish experiment, and basically made Piranha breed at mega rates, mega speed and mega size.  Like every hour goes buy, they range from small fish, to kickable size, then land loving human size, and then flying 18 wheeler size, destroying not only boats, but crashing into skyscrapers and hotels.  Brilliant!

Of course you start out with some boobies, and a few more boobies, and some gushes of blood because woman love to go swimming topless in murky water of course.  But we gradually get to the impossible to escape period of growth where the fish just simply chomp down boats in layers and then eventually just swallow them as the become ""mega"".

There is not one bit of acting to be found here, and that's just fantastic.  Paul Logan pretty much did his Keanu Reeves school of method acting so spot on, that he actually sounds like him.  Whether he's kicking or punching fish, we're just rooting for his abs and can't help to throw in a few ""whoa! dude!"" exclamations here and there.  Speaking of claymation, Tiffany is strategically dressed in scientist garb, and if anyone deserves an award here, it's the wardrobe department who suggested the bulky forgiving vest.  Lastly, you cannot say anything bad about Barry Williams, the guy is TV royalty as Greg Brady.  Sure, he tries his best impression of a cast member from ""24"", but at least he tried!  I highly recommend searching Barry on YT for a recent video called ""Let's Do Lunch"" where he sings and dances about lunchboxes... now THAT is talent!

Eventually common sense has to kick in during the movie so it can end, and you are just left wanting more munching fish. But go all out and get the Blu-ray... and you'll still have money left over for the alcohol companion needed to view this majestic cinematic achievement in film.",1311206400,8,2658,4.845132743362832

4075936,5,B0036BRBOS,"This is the most glorious pile of crap I've ever witnessed. I'm pretty sure at this point that Syfy has figured out that the key to success is by making terribly hilarious science-fiction flicks that become cult classics. Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus was wonderful in its own right...a shark eating airplanes out of the sky, terrible acting, and some of the worst CGI I've ever seen in my life. But Mega Piranha takes the cake. There were piranhas eating boats, jumping into buildings, eating people left and right. This movie displays the worst actors in the world doing what they do worst. The poor line delivery and tragically bad writing make this movie absolutely perfect. The CGI is *so* bad in this movie that the fish look like someone drew them freehand onto pieces of paper and then held them in front of the film. I'm not even exaggerating.

If you love crappy Syfy movies as much as I do, then you *need* to watch this one. I implore you. I almost bought it at Blockbuster when I saw it, but, having never seen it before, I decided against it. I saw it on the Syfy channel a month later and instantly regretted passing it up and bought it on here. It's possibly the best worst science-fiction movie in the history of, well, ever.

PLEASE make your life worth living and buy/watch/rent this movie. Your life will never be the same. Something smells ""fishy"" in Venezuela....*wink wink* I'm hilarious........",1309305600,5,1417,4.664
4075937,3,B0036BRBOS,"Ah the absurdity of The Asylum and their dedication to creating affordable ""Mock-Busters""- knockoff imitations of major Hollywood releases.  So for Bay's Transformers, The Asylum created a look alike Transmorphers film.  When Snakes on a Plane was released, The Asylum already had Snakes a Train available on DVD.  For Aliens Vs Predator, there was an Alien Vs Hunter.  For the Da Vinci Code, there was a Da Vinci's Treasure.  And for Piranha 3-D there is this, Mega Piranha.  I haven't seen seen Piranha 3-D yet, but I doubt it's anywhere near as crazy as The Asylum's Mega Piranha.

The only thing resembling a known figure in this movie is someone known only as Tiffany, perhaps better known from about 2 decades ago as a jail-bait pop singer.  Though in her late thirties here, she is still pretty cute.  I only mention this as that fact makes the film a bit easier to take, because, oh... it's so bad.  But it's bad in a rather charming and entertaining way.  The story is this: a trio of bumbling Scientitians have engineered a race of Giant Killer Mutant Piranha, just for the hell of it.  Oops... they escaped!  Now a Smart Chick and a Tuff Guy have to save the world from the killer fish.  I think I might have written this story when I was about 6.

Nothing you'll see onscreen really makes any sense.  Luckily, the actors themselves aren't taking the movie too seriously, and how could they?  You'd need a Marlon Brando or a Morgan Freeman type actor to lend any amount of gravitas to such a stupid idea.  It's completely mindless.  In one scene, an idiotic scientist exclaims, ""These things must be doubling in size every two days!""  While another disagrees, countering: ""No!  This is exponential growth!""  That's good writing!

Between the ludicrous lines, the Spanish 101 foreign language students as extras, and the Sepia filter on the camera lens, this is some kind of movie.  Everything explodes and the tough guys all have their snappy one-liners.  Tiffany outdoes herself with her acting, particularly as she ineffectually rages on the beach, ""I just want to kill them all!""  This movie is filled with laugh-out-loud moments.

There are some scenes in bad films that end up being captured and recorded online for endless posterity... those are the scenes that make movies like this better than the sum of their awful parts.  This movie is full of such scenes.  Sure, the dialog and story were written with kindergartners in mind.  Sure, the special effects are only special in the ""Rides the Short Bus"" sense.  Nowadays it's all CG, but just a few decades ago it would've been rotoscoped animation.  Either way, it's about as believable.  But when you see Piranha the size of houses leaping out of a shallow river, into hotels and offices and exploding like bombs, you'll know you've found a bit of a gem in this low-rent picture.  You'll even overlook the plastic Nerf toys standing in as futuristic dart guns!

It's fun and funny and probably one of the most entertaining of the Syfy Channel ""Saturday Night Movies"" that I've seen.  Don't pay money for this, but please trick one of your friends into renting it, because it's a must see.",1304553600,4,3158,4.740808823529412
4075938,5,B0036BRBOS,"Don't get me wrong this movie is crap but it's that reason alone that makes it outrageously funny.  As far as bad movies go Alien Vs. Ninja is at the top of my list for most pant-wettingly funny but Mega Piranha is a solid second.  I watched this movie with my friend and we both agree that the scene where the piranha leap out of the water, crash into buildings and explode is priceless, as well as the scene where the guy is kicking the fish, that's great too.  Anyway this movie is packed with bad acting, crappy CG and over the top scenes that will leave you teary eyed.  Watch this flick on netflix because it's worth every minute.",1303689600,,636,4.275
4075939,5,B0036BRBOS,"Okay, this film WILL NOT appeal to everyone.  The acting is horrid, the SFX are nothing special and the basic plot will cause the head of any viewer looking for some trace of common sense to explode.

But, if you're in the right mood, this film is a treasure trove of laughs and ""What the hell"" moments.  Piranha munching on helicopters, leaping down a river like a school of salmon, and even hurling themselves into seafront highrises.  And don't even get started about the hero kicking the nasty fishes as he's attacked on the beach!  I still laugh at that moment.

It's a crappy movie, and I won't try to convince you otherwise.  But it will likely appeal to fans of low grade cinema.  If you enjoy the old Roger Corman stuff (like Attack of the Giant Leeches), you might give this one a try.  Anyone looking for something more serious, I suggest you stay far away.",1301702400,,868,4.477707006369426

I was thoroughly entertained and enjoyed this movie.",1301529600,,328,4.875
4075941,4,B0036BRBOS,"""Mega Piranha"" is another one of those hilarious knock-off epics cooked by Asylum Studios. Of course, these legendary cheese-meisters are exploiting the big studio 3-D remake of ""Piranha,"" and they have taken the concept far beyond the absurdly outrageous. Mind you, nothing about this outlandish opus is remotely plausible. Nevertheless, Asylum has delivered a standard-issue creature feature with enough cinematic sophistication to keep you laughing uproariously at the ridiculous subject matter rather than the people who produced it. Okay, the computer-generated piranha look pretty goofy, but only the most gullible will suffer traumatic after-effects when they bathe alone in a tub. In another one of those hideous scientific experiments gone awry, genetic researchers in Venezuela have created a strain of piranha that mutate into an indestructible predators that double in size and threaten millions.

""Mega Piranha"" opens like the classic movie ""Jaws"" with a gal who goes skinny dipping with her boyfriend. No sooner do they hit the muddy Orinoco River than ravenous piranha hit them. Along come a U.S. diplomat, Ambassador Arnold Regis (Eric Forsberg of ""Alien Abduction ""), and a Venezuela politician on a boat with a couple of big-breasted, bikini-clad babes. While they were discussing politics, the toothsome fish attack, gnaw holes in the hull and make a feast out of them. U.S. Secretary Grady (Barry Williams of ""The Brady Bunch"") alerts buff Special Forces operative Jason Fitch (Paul Logan of ""Cannibal Taboo"") by web cam. According to Grady, Venezuelan Junta Commander Colonel Antonio Diaz (David Labiosa of ""The Entity"") believes terrorists blew up the politicians. Furthermore, the CIA fear the incident may spark an anti-American military coup. ""I need you to check out that river bottom and tell me what really happened before we have another Afghanistan on our hands."" Fitch catches a commercial flight to Venezuela. Before Fitch arrives, UCLA genetics researcher, Dr. Sarah Monroe (pop vocalist Tiffany), wildlife biologist Eli Gordon (Jesse Daly of ""Another Gay Movie""), and microbiologist Brian Huggins (Jude Gerard Prest of ""Teen Vamp"") conduct their own investigation. Piranha are growing at an exponential rate and will triple in size in 36 hours. Indeed, disaster looms!

When our highly-decorated hero lands in Venezuela, a desperate Monroe accosts Fitch at the airport and warns him that Diaz is close-minded and paranoid. Fitch discovers this characteristic for himself later. Meantime, she explains she had been working on hydro-biological experiments. Basically, Monroe and her colleagues have been escalating the size of the local food supply by genetically re-designing species of marine life to make them more robust. She was involved specifically with piranha. What? Why create bigger, meaner piranha? Predictably, those carnivorous piranha escaped captivity and began breeding. Monroe hands him a fragment of the boat hull. Fitch finds no trace of explosives in the sample. Diaz takes Fitch for a chopper ride over area where the boat sank, but he refuses to let him investigate. Moreover, Diaz confines Fitch to the base. A stealthy Fitch slips off the base and gets a local to take him up river. Donning scuba gear, Fitch plunges into the river and swims up to the Arawak Indian Dam in an Orinoco Inlet where he encounters the pugnacious piranha. At first, he slashes at them with his knife. In a shrewd bit of foreshadowing, writer & director Eric Forsberg sets up the ending as the omnivorous piranha converge on the wounded fish and maul it. Fitch wades ashore. A single piranha pursues him with a vengeance. The fish lunges at him, and he stabs it repeatedly until it dies. Fitch slams the dead flesh-eater on Diaz's desk and the colonel cannot believe his eyes.

The scientists inspect Fitch's specimen and learn it has two hearts, triple-thick skin and is an hermaphrodite! Meaning, it can replicate by itself. Since the piranha are holed up behind a natural dam, Huggins recommends they drain the estuary before the fish grow large enough to escape. Instead, the villainous Diaz launches a helicopter assault. They blast the bejesus out of the river, but the fish survive. Of course, Diaz doesn't realize his error. All he knows is the secretive scientists are responsible so he arrests them. He tortures poor Dr. Huggins. Meanwhile, the resilient piranha really begin to grow. Fitch helps Monroe and her associates escape. However, the piranha are heading up river by leaps and bounds. The scientists believe the fish cannot enter the ocean; piranha are fresh-water inhabitants and salt water will kill them. Grady arranges for a destroyer to blast the fish. Predictably, the piranha survive the bombardment, eat the ship, and enter the ocean.

Scenes of piranha leaping out of the sea and suicidally smashing into buildings with explosive impact will make you laugh until your ribs hurt. The scene where Fitch juggles piranha on his boot heels makes this worth the rental price. Make no mistake, these fish make formidable fiends, and Colonel Diaz amounts to a non-stop villain who gets his just deserts. Another way of putting it is he becomes a just dessert for the fish. Before this 93-minute schlock concludes, these gluttonous fish gnaw up a U.S. Navy destroyer, an Ohio Class submarine--the U.S.S. Florida, and a helicopter hovering over the ocean! If you're going to take an idea to the limits, you must trash every modicum of credibility, and the Asylum people have done so with grand gusto. Every character constitutes a hopeless stereotype, but Forsberg never lets the action loiter. The imagery of a school of piranha hurdling down river is side-splitting. A competent cast maintains straight-faced expressions throughout no matter how improbable events turn. Unlike sci-fi mutant movies of the 1950s that justified themselves as cautionary tales about science run amok, ""Meg Piranha"" harbors no such flighty pretensions. This film is strictly fun for fun's sake. The computer-generated imagery doesn't look too bad. Viewers who take themselves seriously should probably pass up this half-baked fish tale. ""Mega Piranha"" qualifies as so bad that it's good!",1301443200,,6220,5.260825780463243

Tiffany is back as Sarah Monroe; this time she's an ichthyologist and geneticist working on improving the fauna of Venezuela's Orinoco River by developing giant flying exploding mutant piranhas. Sadly Lorenzo Lamas is nowhere to be found this time, but ""Mega Piranha"" has something even better: special forces operative Jason Fitch (Paul Logan,) who wears more black than Johnny Cash though he can't act nearly as well, and Barry ""Greg Brady"" Williams as the senior US government representative who spends most of the movie speaking ludicrous dialogue into his cell phone.

The film is mega-schizophrenic with a bit of everything sprinkled in: a wholly improbable and entirely unbelievable romance subplot between the expressionless Fitch and Monroe (as a scientist Monroe should have been able to see there's zero chemistry there!) and an evil South American military despot, with concomitant international relations complications, which are endlessly silly. I was particularly fond of the subplot about the criticality of timing for the US Navy battleship (in truth the ship changed appearance several times, but when it sank it was definitely supposed to be a battleship) to shell a river. The confusion about what the ship is supposed to look like is just one way the people at SyFy exhibit their ignorance of nautical weaponry to hilarious effect; by far the most amusing scenes involve a surface ship and a nuclear submarine being eaten by giant piranhas. (It's actually even funnier than it sounds.) There's lots of equally incredible helicopter action, some great hand to hand (and gill to gill) fighting on display, much over-emoting, incredibly huge continuity issues, and a conclusion that must be seen to be believed. Surely the best way to deal with a giant piranha feeding frenzy is to swim right through their school, right? Obviously.

This movie has it all for cheese lovers: a loopy premise, a terrible script, over the top acting from everyone involved, and hijinks that wouldn't fool a six year old. I particularly love the scene where Fitch escapes notice of guards by straddling two beams just above head level which the guards walk under. I guess they didn't notice him because it was the middle of the day and he was dressed in black. (Ponder.) The special effects need to be singled out as well: apparently no cost was incurred by the filmmakers for their menacing fish CGI. This is truly one of the worst exhibitions of computer-generated effects in the last ten years, and those effects add to the deliciousness of the film immensely.

4075954,3,B0036BRBOS,"Political discussions between a U.S. ambassador and a Venezuelan foreign minister (btw, yes, it is absolutely necessary to have half naked women and champagne around when having such serious talks) are rudely interrupted by a school of overly-ferocious piranha. Sure, the boat they were on was in their turf (being the Amazon Websi...um... River), but our carnivorous friends don't jump the food chain directly to humans, as a rule. I suppose being a genetically altered species of piranha, though, would constitute different rules. Give former 80s pop star Tiffany a round of applause; twenty years ago, she ruined a Beatles song. Today, she potentially has ruined civilization with mutant piranha that, unlike her popularity in the music industry, grow bigger and bigger.

4075955,5,B0036BRBOS,"God bless The Asylum.  Nobody makes low-budget rip-offs of major studio films like these guys - and I think Megapiranha may be their best release yet.  Where else are you going to find Greg Brady (Barry Williams) as Secretary of State ordering military strikes on a foreign country with no apparent involvement by the Department of Defense or the White House?  Where else can you find 80's pop sensation Tiffany playing a genetic scientist?  Best of all, where else could you find humongous piranhas hurling themselves out of the water smack dab into warehouses and other buildings or snatching a helicopter right out of the air?  The fact that the filmmakers didn't have the budget to make the CGI effects look even remotely real just makes a good thing even better.  Little things mean a lot, as well.  For instance, there's one scene where the Secretary of State is speaking to his special forces guy over the phone; it's obviously dark outside at the Secretary's Washington location, but it's the middle of the day in Venezuela.  Apparently, no one thought to check Venezuela's time zone which is actually half an hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time (Chavez made the half-hour change in 2007 because he didn't like being in the same time zone as the US).

Our story begins with the US Ambassador to Venezuela joining a foreign minister and a bevy of bikini-clad young ladies on a leisurely sail through the middle of the jungle.  Suddenly, a school of super piranhas attack, sinking the boat and eating everyone who was on it.  Of course, no one else knows what happened.  While the Venezuelan government claims it was a terrorist attack, Secretary of State Bob Grady sends his top Special Forces guy, Jason Fitch (Paul Logan), down there to find out what really happened.  I like to refer to Paul Logan as ""Iron-face.""  Apparently, at some point in his childhood he held a clenched-teeth, tough guy face for so long that his face actually froze that way, rendering him incapable of making any other facial expression whatsoever.  Fitch barely makes it off the plane before he's accosted by Dr. Sarah Monroe (Tiffany) telling him the ambassador's boat was attacked by giant piranhas she had been experimenting on.  Venezuela's Colonel Diaz disagrees - and remains disagreeable even after being convinced of the truth.  Can Fitch and Monroe's team find a way to stop the megapiranhas - which are growing ""exponentially"" in size and breeding like crazy to boot - before they make it to the coast, spread out across the whole western hemisphere, and eventually take over the world?

If ever a movie begged for a ""Things I Learned From This Movie"" list, it is this one.  Here are just a few things I learned from Megapiranha.  First off, when you're trying to increase the food supply by genetically engineering larger versions of existing animals, it's probably not a good idea to include piranha on your experiment list.  Megapiranhas double in size every 36 hours and can eat through sheet metal.  If you're at the beach when megapiranhas attack, do not take cover in a warehouse or any other large building because the megapiranhas will fly out of the water and crash into the roofs of these large structures, immediately setting them ablaze.  Your best defense against a megapiranha attack in the water is a commando knife; if you are on land and find megapiranhas flying toward you out of the water, your only hope of survival is to immediately lie down on your back and start doing bicycle kicks.  If you are a government official and do not have time to order the evacuation of, say, Miami before megapiranhas will reach the shore, an imminent hurricane warning makes for the perfect cover story.  The only way to stop a school of megapiranhas involves dropping armed gunmen directly in the water alongside them.  Navy Seals can speak normally even with snorkels in their mouths.  You can tell if there are any megapiranhas whatsoever in a large body of water simply by pointing a box that detects fish sonar at the water.  If you're an American citizen and happen to be arrested in Venezuela, some little scrawny soldier is going to continuously yell at you in Spanish regardless of whether or not you understand the language - and you might be subjected to Venezuelan torture, which consists of a soldier hitting you in the head with a phone book if you refuse to give him the answers he wants to his questions.

Needless to say, this is a hilariously bad movie that I enjoyed tremendously.  I wouldn't even want this movie to be given the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment because Mike and the bots couldn't make this any funnier than it already is.  It was a little depressing for me to see how much Tiffany has changed since her pop princess days, but the only thing more unstoppable than a pool of gigantic piranha is time itself.  I suggest you watch this movie with a bunch of your friends - I guarantee a good time will be had by all.",1291248000,7,4956,4.733410942956927

Three stars for being fun and taking the piranha monster-movie genre to a new level.

The characters are competent and believable enough for this movie.  The piranha special effects are hilarious and effective. However, the ending is a let-down.  A different, more complex ending requiring Tiffany's knowledge might have made this a four-star movie.

4075959,2,B0036BRBOS,"When we take the time to sit and watch a movie like Mega Piranha we know what to expect.....somewhat.  We know we'll be seeing washed up stars(or total unknowns), ludicrous science, horrible cgi beasts(in this case, fish), splashes of gore, and almost zero originality plot wise.
So yeah, I expected these things, hell, I enjoy these elements when the mood is right, but what I wasn't expecting was just how grueling an experience it was to sit through this film.  Yes, all of these things were present, but something just wasn't working as it could have in the hands of a different director.
Plot is simple-genetically mutated piranha are growing exponentially in Venezuela.  Stone faced beefcake Rambo type guy is sent to figure it all out.  He meets up with Tiffany and her fellow scientists(they're meddling is the cause of all of this, you see) to stop the rampaging(and growing) piranha and also stop an evil Venezuelan military dude.
The movie must have been made for people with very short attention spans as the action begins very soon after the start and pretty much never lets up.  It feels like one very long action sequence, making 90 minutes seem like 8 and a half hours to me.  I suppose many folks will like this aspect, but for me, being bombarded with action sequences becomes very uninteresting and numbing, kinda like how it feels about an hour into getting a tattoo(assuming your tattoo is a 2 plus hour jobber like mine are.  Otherwise you can readjust that number to about 40 minutes.  Everybody's got a tattoo these days, right?).  And speaking of short attention spans, here's my biggest gripe with the film-Director Forsberg had decided to shoot this film like a friggin' music video.  That is to say that Forsberg is completely unable to keep the camera still.  You know the drill, as it's so prevalent to films these days in some sort of lame attempt to be ""cool""-the camera gets herky jerky, speeds up/slows down, every scene change or action is accompanied by a ""whooshing"" sound.  The film also uses that extremely tacky and irritating device where when each character is introduced, we get a black and white freeze frame and caption across the screen(accompanied by the ""whoosh"") stating the name and title/occupation of the character.  As if we really care who half of these chowderheads are.  Even scenes where people are standing around talking have to have the camera whizzing all about.
Sorry about the rant, but I absolutely despise this type of technique, and it really seems out of place for this kind of film.
I gave it two stars instead of one coz there are a few amusing scenes amongst the boredom.  There is some cool and funny fish carnage(scenes of the giant fish jumping out of the water into buildings is a hoot as they explode like a bomb) that I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy.

4075960,2,B0036BRBOS,"I'm one for hokey and cheap ""icky bug"" movies, but this one has been the worst I've seen in a long time. The special effects were cheesy, the acting atrocious, and the plot simple and by the numbers. The only thing wrong at first glance was that they didn't curse a lot and there were no naked chicks that had nothing to do with the plot.

Despite all, I had a good time laughing at the movie. I didn't know at the time, but the writer/producer is in the movie and dies horribly near the beginning. Kind of a Hitchcock/Shyalaman thing. The hero does the macho thing to the hilt. His muscles bulge so much he can't touch his sides, and he struts around in a very macho ""hero"" kind of way. His acting wasn't that bad, but his ""posing"" was hammed up a bit and over the top.

Tiffany did a halfway decent job as the love interest, however you don't even know she's the actual love interest (except for being the only female in the movie) until the final scene. Huh?

The big problem is the end and how they kill the icky bugs, which are actually giant aggressive Piranhas. What they do to try and kill them is one thing. However, the way they finally accomplish it is so ludicrous, not to mention ""unfinished"" that you are likely to throw something at the TV set. As much as I love cheesy monster movies, when they kill the beasts in the end, there is at least a tad of logic to it. In this case, even stretching the imagination, there is no way they could have killed them all off. I won't say how, but when you get to the end, if you think I'm wrong, let me know why in the comments.

The science is completely out the window, but that is to be expected with this type of movie. I go into them expecting that, and frankly, not caring. I know enough about things to be able to tell when something is scientifically impossible and have no problem rolling with it. In this case, there was not even a modicum of real physics or real science. That is not the intent of these movies anyway, and is one reason I enjoy them so much.

I am giving it two stars because it was at least cheesy and ridiculous entertainment all the way until the final confrontation. I don't think it deserves more stars because even though there were parts of the ending I liked, it made no sense whatsoever and ruined what could have been a decent Saturday afternoon icky bug movie. Usually these movies are better than this. I could blame it on editing, except the whole premise of the ending was wrong to begin with. No amount of editing could have made a difference unless they changed the basic principle behind the final confrontation. Not recommended.",1276214400,,2627,4.33130081300813
4075961,4,B0036BRBOS,"After watching this a second time, I cannot sit silent any longer.  If you like bad/funny (as opposed to bad/boring) movies, Mega Piranha must be seen!  This is either a brilliant parody or a totally inept effort (I think both), but it is fun.

Ten things I find great about this movie:

1) The hero, Jason Fitch, steps off the plane, a scientist (80s pop star Tiffany) stops him and explains the danger of the Mega Piranha, and he believes her!

2) The hero: He never changes his expression, and always wears black.  Even when he is sneaking around in broad daylight he is wearing black!  There is a montage of him sneaking into the government base in daylight, and at one point he is about ten feet up, straddling the pathway (and dressed in black), and the guards do not even see him.

3) Fitch lying on his back and using bicycle kicks to fend off the attacking Mega Piranha.

4) Another reviewer noted the inconsistancies of the background shots from out of the car windows, but what about the jungle?  The river where the Mega Piranha live is surrounded by dense jungle; but when the two scientists visit it it is scrub and looks like the hills surrounding Los Angeles.

5) Regarding the two scientists, I love the part when they watch a Venezuelan soldier being eaten by the Mega Piranha.  There are several cuts between the attack and one horrified scientist trying to run and help while being restrained by the other scientist.  The acting and the length of the scene make it hilarious.  Did they just repeat the shots of the scientists?

6) Another gaffe I did not notice reviewed is the US naval ship.  From far away it looks like some kind of frigate, but when it fires, and later when it sinks, it is obviously a battleship.  And why is it that in these Sy Fy movies naval personnel are allowed to have long hair (the captain has it slicked back) and no insignia on their uniforms?

7) The MEGA PIRANHA!  They change size from scene to scene, they can jump out of the water and travel quite a distance (which is how they escape into the Gulf of Mexico), and they explode when they hit something!  Among the delights of the movie are the shots of the Mega Piranha which did not explode: they stick out of the buildings with their tales wiggling. And of course, like its cousin the Mega Shark, the Mega Piranha can leap out of the water and grab a passing aircraft (in this case a helicopter).

8) The characters: I was rooting for the bad guy Venezuelan officer, because  I don't blame him for wanting to get rid of the scientists.  They caused the whole problem and we are supposed to side with them?  I think Barry Williams is supposed to be the Secretary of State.  I did not know that the Secretary of State micro-managed such operations.  He walks around without aides or secret service and actually travels to the most dangerous area (although he is protected by the SUPER BUNKER).  I can't imagine Hillary Clinton doing that.

9) The many other things: The bad guy's helicopter flys away and then, after an interval of hours, reappears out of nowhere at the end.  Doesn't the helicopter need fuel?  At one point the heroes do not notice Venezuelan soldiers with guns attacking them until the soldiers are about three feet away, but in the next shot the heroes have gotten away. And there is so much more...

10) Finally, there is a SUPER BUNKER on a US government oil rig type base.  It is written on the screen a few times so we know that this is not just any US government bunker...it is a SUPER BUNKER!

This is so bad that it had to be made with tongue in cheek.  Perhaps Paul Logan is acting that way as a parody of that type of character, and why, after casting 80s pop star Debbie Gibson in Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus, cast Tiffany in another Mega fish movie unless it is intentional?  (Hey, how about Paula Abdul in Mega Barracuda?)  But then there are those moments which seem legitimate, such as when Tiffany is in shock, chanting that they can't stop the Mega Piranha; her acting seems unintentionally funny.  Regardless, it is fun!

I bought Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus and I can't wait to buy this to have a mega double feature with mega female popstars from the 80s.",1275264000,15,4202,4.465879265091863

The main reason I even gave this one two stars is because I absolutely love this kind of stuff.

It is made by SyFy pictures, and that should say something by itself. what's more, the storyline and the acting are jumbles that tell you about things that seem to make sense in some way until you get to the ending.
