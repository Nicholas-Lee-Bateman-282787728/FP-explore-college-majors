4404899,3,B004LUK61I,"A fair Roald Dahl-penned suspense-drama, 'The Night Digger' (a.k.a. 'The Road Builder,' MGM UK, 1971) suffers from the somewhat guileless artistry and flat storytelling approach of small-screen director Alastair Reid.  Performances are very good-- perhaps the primary thing to recommend about TND-- but the overall feel of the film never quite matches the level of intensity necessary to fulfill the demands of Dahl's multifaceted, psychosexually charged script.  What we're left with, then, is a routine treatment of a routine serial-killer mystery/melodrama that in more skilled hands might have been a real chiller.  Still, it's a reasonably entertaining hour-and-a-half, compelling enough to keep a fan of the genre's attention provided he bears in mind there's nothing here that hasn't been done many times before, and after, and done more stylishly.  3-minus stars.",1385251200,3,871,5.625954198473282
4404900,4,B004LUK61I,"The Night Digger (Alastair Reid, 1971)

These days, Alastair Reid's entry in who's-who-in-film is pretty much set in stone; he directed Traffik, the 1989 TV miniseries remade into a heavy-handed, almost entirely unwatchable movie by Steven Soderbergh eleven years later (and then remade yet again into another TV miniseries!). Thankfully, no one has thought to remake The Night Digger, the kind of just-this-side-of-cheesy mystery where all the stars were in alignment when someone worked it up: Reid directing, a script by Roald Dahl (Tales of the Unexpected) from a novel by Joy Cowley, one of New Zealand's most successful writers. And my god, what a cast. Patricia Neal, of course, who was married to Dahl at the time and worked on all his projects. Peter Sallis. Graham Crowden. Pamela Brown. Jean Anderson. Yootha Joyce. And I'm just scraping the tip of the iceberg.

The plot is a simple one: Maura Prince (Neal) is a not-so-young-anymore woman who has devoted her life to taking care of her invalid mother (Cleopatra's Pamela Brown in one of her last roles). Her life is shaken up when a young stranger (Excalibur's Nicholas Clay) arrives and starts to woo her. Question is, is he the Night Digger, the serial killer who's been preying on lovely young things around the countryside?

It's very low-key, and not very fast-paced, which pretty much guaranteed that it wasn't going to make a huge splash at the box office. But you put this caliber of cast together with the connections on the other end of the camera and you're bound to get something wonderful. Such is the case here. There is atmosphere galore, and the acting is about as you'd expect (which is to say if you're not a fan of Britcoms from the seventies, you might not find it as wonderful as I do). There's a plot twist at the end (which I understand is not in the original novel) that could have been done without, but it does fit and isn't completely out of the blue. Not easy to find these days, but definitely worth tracking down. Patricial Neal's performance is reason enough to watch this; everything else is a bonus. *** ",1363046400,6,2100,4.760989010989011

BUT wow, what a sketchy moral outlook: the serial killer is not only handsome & likeable, a flashback even implies that his desire to kill isn't really his fault, as he was abused as a boy.",1511395200,,330,4.171875
8434844,3,B004LUK61I,"Alternately known as The Road Builder in the UK, this is a disturbing, unpleasant, but well-mounted 1971 thriller, with elements reminiscent of Hangover Square, Psycho and -- curiously -- Hitchcock's Frenzy (even though Frenzy was actually released one year *after* The Night Digger). Written for the screen by Roald Dahl, The Night Digger is exceptionally well-acted, with superb performances from Patricia Neal, Nichols Clay (best-known for playing Sir Lancelot in Excalibur 10 years later) and Pamela Brown, all aided by nuanced direction from Alistair Reid.

Cinematographer Alex Thomson, best-known for his late-career work in fantasies and lavish period pieces, shows a grittier side here, with harsh, clinical, high-key lighting in the decaying manor house where much of the action takes place.

Bernard Herrmann's score isn't among his best, but is very well-done, and really ignites the scenes where it is used. His inimitable, surging string-writing adds incalculable tension, while his theme for Neal's character (and her regrets about life) provides a melancholy air of nostalgia.

All said and done, while The Night Digger is unassailably ""well made"" it is an almost intolerably depressing film, and not what you'd call ""enjoyable"". It looks forward to the general tone of early-mid 70s films, and the vogue of dark subjects and downer endings. Another critical problem is the casting of Neal, who is a fine actress, but only nine years younger than Brown who plays her mother. (I also have trouble believing that Clay's character would fall in love with a woman Neal's age. Perhaps their affair was born of a Freudian ""mother fixation"", but the film never infers this is the case.)

This movie is also depressing on another level, because it should have been Frenzy that Bernard Herrmann scored, not this.",1489795200,,1819,5.2620689655172415

8434848,4,B004LUK61I,"The most distinct impression you get from ""The Night Digger"" is the obvious influence of Alfred Hitchcock.  There's a certain psychosexual aura that permeates the proceedings but, alas, director Alastair Reid has the minutia of the Master down pat but is at a loss in the suspense department.  The nature of the misogynist killer, Billy Jarvis (Nicholas Clay), is revealed much too early depriving the film of a much needed pulse.  That said this film should be seen for the terrific performances of the leads.  Patricia Neal has never been better as the physically and emotionally scarred caregiver Maura Prince.  Probably in her mid-forties at the time the film was made and recovering from a life threatening stroke Neal makes Maura a pillar of strength even while the character she plays is breaking up inside.  Neal even uses the effects of her stroke to her advantage imbuing dimension to her performance. Pamela Brown avoids clich  managing to engender some sympathy as Maura's mean spirited and controlling adoptive mother.  Clay's work recalls Anthony Perkins' turn as Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" and makes Billy wholly original and empathetic.  ""The Night Digger"" is ultimately a film that falls short of its lofty ambitions but worth checking out.",1438646400,,1255,5.112745098039215
8434849,5,B004LUK61I,"Long live Nicholas Clay.  His talent and hotness is forever captured in this (his first) haunting film.  The end is a bit abrupt.  I wanted a little more and I can see why Bernard Hermann suggested the ending be changed.  It's also great to see Patricia Neal back after her stroke, working her real life trauma into the role.  Having a talented writer like Raold Dahl (Neal's husband at the time) adapting the screenplay elevates the film as well.  It has a Hammer Films look to it - a huge plus in my book.... And I think the exteriors are in fact Oakley Court which was used in numerous Hammers as well as Rocky Horror.  I highly recommend this film.  And if you are captivated by Clay as I am.  I suggest a double feature with ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" - the sexiest film of all time.  What could be better than Nicholas Clay and Sylvia Kristel?!  I can't imagine anything...",1425081600,2,877,4.41875
8434850,4,B004LUK61I,"A better than average thriller with expert performances by Patricia Neal and Nicholas Clay and screenplay by Roahl Dahl.  This movie takes an interesting angle on the familiar psychopath stalker narrative.  Strangely, the stalker himself is a somewhat sympathetic character as he he is depicted in the round with good and bad qualities.  The fact that he is young and handsome and very much broken adds to the complexity of our emotions for him.  We are partially privy to the roots of his pathology and guess much of what isn't directly revealed about his past.  Though his crimes are execrable, he seems to be trapped and agonized by them.  The fact that we and Patricia Neal's character never witness these events, at least in their worst aspects, gives us room to feel pity.  Furthermore, Ms Neal never seems to be in jeopardy herself.  Her age and motherly function protect her from the killer's rage.  It is rare to find a tale of this ilk in which a female lead is not in grave jeopardy and very much in jeopardy throughout.  Her evolution through the course of the narrative is nearly as disturbing as his.  She finds herself protecting him and sleeping with him to recapture something of her lost youth and lost opportunities for love.  Both she and he have been warped by overbearing mothers.  Hence their connection.  Meanwhile, he so desperately needs the motherly attention that she so much wants to give.  In the end, it feels more like a tragedy wrought by internal character flaws than a thriller.  A refreshing change from the usual, though just as disturbing for the unexpected and inappropriate feelings it evokes as for the violence revealed or implied.",1410825600,,1673,4.817543859649123
