896591,2,630454636X,I love The Wonder Years - I truely do.  I rented this movie because I insist on watching all the movies that Wonder Years stars are in. Here what I've got to say about it: It's the stupidist movie I've ever seen in my  life.  It's so stupid that it's funny that it's so stupid.  UGH!!  I give  this movie two stars and only because I feel sorry for it.,920764800,2,352,3.9571428571428573

In this mind thrilling adventure through the underworld; a boy named Brian gets challenged to sleep in his brothers room where there is a so called monster. Brian gets so worked up trying to catch the monster he makes a trap. When Brian catches him, he convinces him to go to the underworld with him. In the underworld he meets some funky and radical monsters. After some cool adventures Brians brother gets kidnapped by the evil ruler of the underworld. Brian and his friends save him by using one power that can kill the monsters, but you have to find this power out by watching the movie.

COMPARISON: I would compare this movie to Harry and the Hendersons.
 ACTOR/ACTRESSES: Brian Stevenson  Fred Savage
 Maurice  Howie Mandel
Their performance was amazing.
THE GOOD: Its one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, it won't get boring, and if you by it you will never regret your decision. The range of age is from 5-unlimited in my opinion.
 THE BAD: It could be frightening for some younger viewers.
THE UGLY: The visual effects weren't the best Ive seen but made the monsters look realistic.",1449619200,,1130,4.7055837563451774

897750,3,630454636X,"Brian Stevenson traps the monster under the bed after being blamed for a number of 'accidents' around the house, and the kooky creature invites Brian to join him in the monster world below. At first, scaring kids and living a life without rules seems great, but soon, Brian realizes that he has been lured into becoming a monster, himself! LITTLE MONSTERS is better left to fond remembrances, since the film does not play nearly as well to the older crowds as it does for its intended younger audiences. Howie Mandel performs his third-rate 'Beetlejuice' impersonation as the monster, Maurice, whose wackiness is way more annoying than entertaining. While the story here certainly has potential, the limited budget and shabby production quality take away from the overall enjoyment of the film, although elements of the plot can be seen in Disney's wildly successful animated feature, MONSTERS, INC. Kids are sure to enjoy the sillier scenes where Brian and Maurice play pranks on the other children, but parents be warned.. There are still enough frightening moments in LITTLE MONSTERS to terrify children under 10.

Second, there are curse words that are totally inappropriate for kids, like the monster pulls down Fred Savages pants and a girl monster says ""nice a$$"", that's just one of several examples.
Third, and most important, the whole movie has a weird and unsettling feeling to it. But during the climax, when the little kid, who is about 5, is strapped to the wall, with darts thrown at his head, the main monster pulls his face off, exposing his slimy face with his bloody eyeballs hanging out, it was time for me to hit the stop button. My kids were relieved to have it over.
It's a bad 80's, albeit very mild in comparison, horror movie. Adults will find it corny and obnoxious, and kids will find it bizzare and frightening, the stuff that nightmares are made of. In short, just awful.",1312416000,9,917,4.464285714285714

There's no moral or lesson. It's not that fun at all. The images are too scary for most kids and visualy unpleasing. The Monster World is not even that creative. It looks like the backstage of the set. There's a ton of unexplain story issuses like the parents getting a divorce. It's also very mean-spirited. The pranks,the father and monsters are all cruel. Not only that,the cruelty in this film amount to nothing. Overall, avoid this movie at all cost. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1292284800,4,659,4.739130434782608

897999,1,630454636X,"Oh my gosh-this is probably one of the worst movies I have seen with my kids ever!!! The kids in the movie were great, the premise, or where I think they were trying to go with it, had potential, but the final product was just was a big FAIL. Not sure if Beetlejuice came out before this movie, but it seemed to me that Howie Mandel's character-Maurice-was based on Michael Keaton's character of Beetlejuice, which I absolutely loved! It was an epic disaster. I couldn't understand much of what Maurice was saying as he was too busy bouncing off the walls, and flailing his arms around. On top of this, I had to listen to a jingling, tinkling sound every time Maurice moved-which was every nanosecond, no down time with this character. I guess he was wearing metal things on his clothing-very annoying. Maurice was very irritating-I know my 10-year old son would have told him to take a hike, ""Hey, dude, take it down a notch. You're such a spaz.""

I keep hearing about how ""endearing"" and ""timeless"" the friendship between Fred Savage's character and Maurice was. I just didn't feel it, yet I cry during cat commercials and most corny movies-I am very emotional : ) I found Maurice to be an idiot, extremely stupid, and plain mean. If you see the movie, then you'll understand per the terrible pranks he does to the kids he is supposed to scare (pouring out a school kids apple juice, then urinating in the bottle while the child is sleeping upstairs, scraping tuna off kid's sandwich and replacing it with cat food, trying to scare the death out of a baby in her crib, etc.). If this had been rated R, maybe even PG-13, and done better (maybe it was director's fault), then they could have gotten away with it. I think the movie went so far to each extreme: creepy, then back to endearing, but it just flopped.

Beside all the foul language coming out of the kids' mouths, the final straw for me was when the leader of the ""underworld"" (character's name is Boy), grabs a child monster for doing something that made him mad, and trying to squeeze the life out of him/her (couldn't tell what gender) and threatening it with bodily harm and then finally rips its head off. During this rant, ""Boy"" is telling the young monster-prior to ripping its head off-how much he enjoys scaring it, and in a very weird, creepy, undulating voice. I swear, I was sooo creeped out. It was almost as if he was having the big ""O.""

I got up at this point and started to clean up around the house. I let my kids finish watching it, but I absolutely do not recommend this movie for children. It is pointless, has gratuitous violence and, unlike other reviewers, I think the ""barely there"" friendship message, that gets lost in the midst of the other garbage, is not worth the inappropriateness of most of the movie.",1286064000,12,2795,4.53069306930693

898060,5,630454636X,"Little Monsters is a funny and slightly moving family comedy that reminds me of my childhood days when I first saw the movie - I just wanted to share it with my daughter =-D It is not for everybody though. My daughter thought that is was a good movie and wanted to watch it again...she is 4 years old any movie that she finds entertaining we have to watch at least 3 times; it may have been a little ""mature"" for her but I watched as a kid too and I turned out alright.

To sum it up. Fred Savage plays Brian who moves into a new town; he keeps getting into trouble and blamed for things that he didn't do. He eventually captures Howie Mandle who plays the monster Maurice. Maurice introduces Brian to the monster world and secretly tires to convert him. They become friends in the meantime. Brian has a disagreement in monster morality and decides it is not for him. Boy (<---Creepy bad guy monster) kidnaps his little brother Eric (who is Matt Savage) and Brian and Crew go to save the day. Maurice is a true friend and helps them get Eric and get out of monster world. At the end of the credits is the best when the call and tell their parents that they are in Malibu...

I still love this movie and I am 25 now. Although, it is not as funny as it was when I was a kid. After I watched this movie back in 1989 - 1990 I put the sarin wrap on the toliet...thought it was so funny...ended up being grounded. If you are one of those very overprotective parents I do not recommend you let your young one watch this movie. If you don't think putting sarin wrap on the toliet is a funny childish prank...you should probably not watch this movie...",1240099200,3,1643,4.212698412698413
898061,5,630454636X,"I remember when this movie first came out. Snooty critics ripped it to shreds but the kids loved it. Two critically acclaimed critics did a scathing review of the movie but the movie still had its fan base. Besides who cares about the wayward opinions of the same high brow Beavis and Butthead critics that gave Speed 2: Booze Control two thumbs up? Exactly, now lets move on.

Story: Eric Stevenson(Fred Savage) moves into a different state and has a hard time adjusting there. He later on befriends a mischievous monster named Maurice(Howie Mandell) that is easily harmed by bright lights. Eric and Maurice become friends and they visit Maurice underworld home. Later on Eric's brother is kidnapped by the same creature that bullies Maurice as well as the ruler of that underworld and now has to rely on the help of Maurice as well as a friend and a former bully to help him retrieve his brother.

This movie brings back a lot of memories and after seeing it recently it still holds well after all these years. Howie Mandell is hilarious as the wise-cracking but fun-loving Maurice. Fred Savage as well as the rest of the cast is good also. I love the imagination of the writers also. Sure the movie has some dark undertones but as I kid I loved it and as an adult I still love it. The sets are creative down to the monsters. Now for the people that are comparing Maurice to Beetlejuice, there is a stark contrast there: Maurice is a likable doofus with a heart that sometimes takes his antics to far(like using hands to chew up an unlucky person's homework). Beetlejuice, on the other hand is an unlikable creep that put his ulterior motives before anything else. There is a very big difference in character there.

Little Monsters is one of those movies that defined childhood memories of the 80s. You cant mention great movies that defined the 80s without mentioning Little Monsters. That's like talking about movies that defined the 90s without mentioning T2: Judgment Day. Its impossible.
Plus Little Monsters is not only creative and unique but its also fun to watch something that is absent from a lot of movies nowadays. You remember the word ""fun"" right? Its what movies used to be before they became mundane and extremely repetitive. I recommend this movie to anybody that is a fan of 80s movies and I also dare you to not get choked up in the final scene where Maurice says goodbye to Eric. You look at me and tell me that scene doesnt move you to tears. Ahh, the memories. Movie like this are the reason why people always go back to the 80s and after the recent crop of garbage out now who can blame them?",1236470400,3,2619,4.568085106382979

Howie Mandel and Fred Savage give fine performances in this caper based on those childhood fears of monsters under the bed or in the closet.
The monsters could have been made scary but were tonned down for younger children although, the two head monsters could scare younger children.
 Brian (Savage)discovers a strange world under his bed where he soon makes friends with Maurice(Mandel). As Brian has just moved with his family to a new area and has no friends he and Maurice start a nightly rampage of mayhem to get children in trouble with their parents. This soon effects his school work and when he gets the girl he likes into trouble over her homework he decides to stop. Unfortunately the head monsters are keen to make Brian a permenent monster so they kidnap his younger brother forcing Brian to enlist the help of his girlfriend,his brother's friend and the school bully to save the day.
