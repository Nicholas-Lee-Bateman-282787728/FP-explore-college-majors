3907361,4,B002CWKU0Y,I love all of Pam Grier movies she is a very good actor no mater what role she plays she can do her thing,1400284800,,105,3.4166666666666665
3907362,5,B002CWKU0Y,"One of the best blaxploitation bangs for the buck on the market. 2 top-tier Pam Grier titles chock full of violence, nudity and storylines that just aren't made with this kind of gusto anymore.",1396051200,,193,4.705882352941177
3907363,5,B002CWKU0Y,"I was so glad when I seen this movie collection that had one of my idols, Pam Grier in it.  I just couldn't believe it and it is classic '70s movies.  Both of these movies were so good.  I am glad that I got it. I hope that this helps someone else buy this movie collection.",1380758400,,274,3.857142857142857
3907364,3,B002CWKU0Y,"Black exploitation to the nth degree but Pam is a trooper to be in this trashy ""black is beautiful"" movie.

3907365,5,B002CWKU0Y,"Who is Pam Grier's contemporary?  Nobody.  Anything with Pam is a guarantee adventure ride and Black Mama, White Mama/Foxy Brown are two fine examples of what 70s cinema was all about, action, action, and action.  Pam had a cameo recently in The Man With The Iron Fists, she's still around and still has that unique presence that draws you in and keeps you captivated, why she has not received a Life Time Achievement Oscar is beyond me.  Far from her only great performances, this double feature is a  fine introduction to her work.  If you don't know Pam, you don't know 70s cinema.",1364083200,2,584,4.621359223300971
3907366,4,B002CWKU0Y,"The acting is not so great, but anyone who is a fan of Pam Grier, will enjoy seeing her in action.  Actually, I liked FOXY BROWN best of all her Blaxploitation films. Most nudity of Pam, heh heh.  Black Mama/White Mama is from th esame Roger Corman genre of Women in Prison films so many teenage (and old, too) guys loved from the 1970s. Same old B-grade actors around the Extravagant Pam.  Again, seeing Pam naked in multiple scenes is th ereason I went to the drive-in movie theater to begin with during my Junior High and High Schol years in the 1970s.  I am another white guy who LUVs Pam. Actually, most of the BLOG reviews about which I read, are written by white guys who grew up in the 1970s and are infatuated with Pam Grier.  I could write about the movies, the plot, th ephotography, the b-roll backgorund scenes from the Phillipines; however, I never watched a Pam Grier movie for the theatrical drama.  I watch Pam Grier movies to see PAM GRIER naked. Both of these movies, combined on one DVD, are excellent if you like little plot and lots of Pam's jiggling breasts.",1350345600,,1081,4.434343434343434
3907367,5,B002CWKU0Y,"Item was purchased as a gift for a friend.  I remember seeing this movie at the drive-in when it first came out.  I was too young to appreciate the ""badness"" of this film, and others like it.  Now that I am an old guy...I love, Love, LOVE these '70s Schlocktaculars!  Revolutionaries, Harem girl, prison shower scene...

Let's see if those Merchant Ivory guys can TOP that!  Yeah, I didn't think so.",1299024000,,399,4.549295774647887
3907368,5,B002CWKU0Y,"Pam Grier fans will love this ""double feature"" of two of her best films:
  Pam and her co-star Margaret Markov spend most of ""Black Mama, White Mama"" (from a story by Joseph Viola and Jonathan Demme; 1973)  handcuffed together; similar to Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis in ""The Defiant Ones."" Karen (Markov) wants to help her revolutionary friends. All tough-talking Lee (Pam Grier) wants is to grab a stash of cash and escape on a boat. When Karen's friends help her and Lee escape prison, it's a wild race through the jungle; as they defeat sadistic, lesbian prison guards and even temporarily dress as nuns! They are pursued by Pam's frequent co-star Sid Haig, who is easily distracted by some easily bedded babes. ""Black Mama, White Mama"" is a perfectly entertaining mix of adventure, action, and comedy.
  Revenge is especially sweet when Pam Grier stars as super-sassy, super-sexy ""Foxy Brown."" And, as the title song says, don't make Foxy mad-- or you'll find out she's ""Super-Bad."" ""Foxy Brown"" (1974) reunited Pam with ""Coffy"" writer-directer Jack Hill. ""Foxy Brown"" follows a successful formula; very similar to ""Coffy."" Foxy Brown  has a score to settle with the drug-dealers who put a hit out on her boyfriend Michael (Terry Carter).  Foxy first unleashes her fury on her no-good, dope-pushing  brother Linc (Antonio Fargas), who is also responsible for Michael's murder. Foxy goes undercover as a  prostitute and, while helping a prostitute escape, engages in an obligatory lesbian bar brawl. After her cover is blown, Foxy ingeniously turns the tables on the scumbags who torture her at a ""ranch."" But the  unique revenge Foxy takes on central villains Steve and Kathryn (Peter Brown and a delightfully over the top Kathryn Loder) has to be seen to be believed! ""Foxy Brown"" is super-entertaining, super-fabulous fun!!",1282780800,,1832,5.076666666666667
