8060862,5,B0009HBPGW,"This workout has been out for awhile, but it is so awesome that I bought a replacement when my older version wore out.",1476748800,,118,4.173913043478261
8060863,4,B0009HBPGW,"Great Workout, unfortunately, I had to return this dvd due to skipping on the dvd itself",1461628800,,88,4.5625
8060864,5,B0009HBPGW,As anticipated,1410739200,,14,6.5
8060865,5,B0009HBPGW,"This is a really good tape for an intermediate stepper. Just a few complex moves, but since Rob's build-up is excellent, there are good alternate moves for less experienced steppers. I never get tired of this DVD and consider it my ""plan B"" when I can't decide what to play.",1254009600,,274,4.5
8060866,1,B0009HBPGW,"I ordered this DVD, and received a case and disk that both had this title on them, but surprise! the DVD is actually of a whole different topic, not the one it claims to be. Don't buy a used copy! I am guessing that mine came from some low quality bootleg operation that doesn't read english and never realized the mix-up.",1237248000,,322,4.295081967213115
8060867,5,B0009HBPGW,I met Rob Glick 2 years ago. He is amazing. I am happy to have this dvd because I love to see the layers he uses. Plus you can rewind to learn the layers. He makes stepping so much fun that you forget you are working out. He is as good as they get.,1236124800,,248,3.611111111111111
8060868,4,B0009HBPGW,"Although I would call myself an advanced stepper in terms of stamina and strength, I'm completely hopeless with routines that are more than basic athletic steps.  Rob Glick is a fantastic instructor and the routines are great for the right person (if you like Christi Taylor or Cathe Freidrich, you'll love Rob Glick), but despite stubborn efforts on my part, I just can't master his style.

If you consider yourself an advanced stepper and are very familiar with both dance and step terms and are comfortable with routines that continually change, you'll really like this workout.  If, like me, your favorite step workouts are more basic (Gin Miller, Gilad, Kathy Smith), you might struggle with the frustration level you'll encounter with this workout.",1184198400,12,754,5.1138211382113825
8060869,4,B0009HBPGW,"This is quite a good workout.  I'd always heard of Rob Glick, but this is my first dvd of his and I like it.  It uses a lot of unique choreography and that is what separates it from the rest of step workouts and makes this interesting.  It's fun, funky and fresh.

It's easy to follow because he explains each move well, and he keeps adding on to the combinations to make one big combination.  It's a little over an hour, but it's great and motivating and he's a very good instructor.",1149120000,3,484,4.217391304347826
8060870,5,B0009HBPGW,I bought this 2 years ago and still love it!! It's exceptionally well cued with lots of options & modifications.  The moves are dancy but not hard follow (as long as you're not a beginner. High energy and excitement from beginning to end!,1127174400,7,238,4.534883720930233
