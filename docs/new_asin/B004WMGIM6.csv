8445300,5,B004WMGIM6,Awesome film! Albeit a bit messed up. Look to IMDb for more details.,1426809600,,68,4.3076923076923075
8445301,5,B004WMGIM6,"Revenge: A Love Story beings with Chan Kit visiting a young pregnant woman, and chokes her husband to death. It turns out Kit also killed the young woman and removed the fetus, dumping at a river nearby. Through a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Kit fell in love with a mentally retarded girl, Cheung Wing. When Wing is mistaken for a prostitute by a man, Kit beats the man, and takes Wing to the police. Unfortunately, the suspected rapist is a police officer, and the corruption of this officer quickly spreads to the others as they proceed to rape her and frame Kit. When Kit is released, hell breaks loose...

The story in this film is an effective story of unconditional love and revenge. Although it starts off brutally, the film does take time to develop the fragile relationship between Kit and Wing - a poor kid and an innocent woman. I can feel the love between the characters, and I can feel the pain when the officers commit their atrocious crimes. It follows a brutal path, until its phenomenal ending. If you're not comfortable with sad, even depressing endings, this ending may be overwhelming; it does try to end on a bittersweet note, though.

The acting is great from the entire cast. The performances are believable, and there is chemistry between the two lead characters. The film uses a dark, gritty atmosphere, and occasionally blends slow-motion sequences to create its own unique style. The music is fantastic, the theme is mesmerizing. Although the story is nonlinear, it is fairly easy to follow. The story is also paced ferociously.

The Hong Kong Blu-ray features superb picture and audio quality - two factors that helped create the gritty vibe of the film. This Blu-ray does not have an English Dub, but does feature English Subtitles - there are a few spelling and grammatical errors, but they ultimately work well. This Blu-ray also features a Making-Of Featurette and the trailer.

Overall, Revenge: A Love Story is a fantastic revenge thriller - the pure brutality and meaning of the film is very effective. It's a film that will stay with you long after its end. It breaks the ""Hollywood"" rules and follows it's own path much like the iconic South Korean revenge thrillers. I highly recommend Revenge: A Love Story to those that can stomach it.

Revenge: A Love Story features strong violence and blood, and nudity and sex (an inaudible rape scene.)",1370304000,,2394,4.800970873786408
8445302,4,B004WMGIM6,The disk arrived fast. It was in it's original box and wrapper.  The Blue-Ray played excellent.  The movie also came with english translation.,1363392000,,142,5.130434782608695
8445303,3,B004WMGIM6,"This is a Hong Kong film that deals with the revenge sub genre that keeps the action ramped up right from the start and through out. It stars Juno Mak as Kit who wrote this as an original idea and got some help from others for the screenplay. He plays a small town grocer whose speciality is making steamed buns for the less than appreciative locals.

One of his regulars in Sola Aoi who plays the beautiful but mentally `retarded' Wing. By circumstances partly in the contrivance of Kit they come together. Not long after she is brutally gang raped by the local cops. He not only is forced to watch but is then framed for assaulting a police officer whilst `resisting arrest'. So we are set up for pure medieval revenge and the audience are fully behind him.

The twist is that this is particularly brutal and not in the slightest way in `eye for an eye' territory. What follows is a fast paced and often violent story that has more twists than a sack full of rattle snakes on speed. It had me gripped for the most part, then comes the `however'.

The story is told in a series of chapters which have titles indicating the moral tale to come and these are all well balanced and played out well for the first hour or so of this ninety minutes offering. Then we start to get a few too many holes in the plot, where reality is dumped at the altar of keeping the plot `exciting'. Then we have some poor SFX which were unnecessary and poor in execution.

The final twist has some impact but is essentially one of those `not again' moments, but to say anymore would be a plot spoiler. Comparisons to `I Saw The Devil' are ambitious at best.

It works for the most part, but only if you suspend belief for the greater part, and that is fine for a lot of people. So if you want an action film with some gore and lots of corrupt cops then sit back and enjoy, if you can not help but analyse everything then might be one to skip. All that said, I still was gripped up until very close to the conclusion so a reluctant three stars but I am trying to be objective.",1334793600,,2053,4.253846153846154
