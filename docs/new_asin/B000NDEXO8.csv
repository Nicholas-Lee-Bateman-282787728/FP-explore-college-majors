2764939,2,B000NDEXO8,The first season started with a TV Pilot movie starring Loretta Swit as Cagney. Then 6 episodes with Meg Foster as Cagney. That was the first season. I cancelled my pre-order as soon as I found out these episodes were not available. Sorry! But don't try to sell me a lie! Let me have the pilot and original episodes as shown. Otherwise FORGET ABOUT IT!,1177459200,7,352,4.430769230769231
2764940,5,B000NDEXO8,"I am glad that the older crime dramas such as ""Hawaii Five-0"", ""Ironside"", and now ""Cagney & Lacey"" are finally being put on DVD. This show was unique in that it was the first time that two basically average looking women played the leads in a TV show that was not about the fact that they were just average looking women. The show was also ground-breaking in that both detectives in the partnership were women - smart, capable women. Women had gradually been integrated into TV police forces over the 15 years prior to this series, but prior to this they were usually part of a crime-solving team such as on ""Ironside"". The balance in this show was not through the well-known old cop/young cop formula. Instead, both detectives were 30-something women. The contrast came in the form of their marital status and their personal situations. Lacey was married and a mother, and Cagney was single.

Technically, this is not season one of this show. There was a pilot and six episodes during the 1981-1982 season starring an actress other than Sharon Gless as Detective Christine Cagney. This DVD set contains the 22 episodes that comprised the 1982-1983 season which is technically season two.",1174521600,35,1189,4.828431372549019
2764941,5,B000NDEXO8,"This was a landmark series.  I remember it being part of the CBS Monday night line-up after Newhart and Kate & Allie.  Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly dominated the Emmy Awards for the entire run of the series - no other dramatic actress on TV during the 1980s could come close.  The most vivid episode I recall was from season 2, I believe as Sidney Clute was still alive, called ""Heat.""  Mary Beth is held hostage during the summer in a boxcar.  Tyne was - no IS incredible!  I can't say enough about this series or the two actresses.",1172534400,16,531,4.313131313131313

2764944,5,B000NDEXO8,"This four-disc set represents the first and long-overdue U.S. DVD release of the landmark police drama Cagney & Lacey.

This remarkable series, which dealt with controversial social topics, ended up being quite controversial on its own. It began with a pilot in 1981 starring Loretta Swit and Detective Christine Cagney, and Tyne Daly as her partner, Detective Mary Beth Lacey. When the show debuted as a series the following year on CBS, Cagney was portrayed by Meg Foster while Daly reprised her role. The show suffered poor ratings and Foster only last six episodes. She was replaced by Sharon Gless in the pivotal role of Cagney, while Daly remained in unforgettable portrayal of Lacey. It was widely reported that Foster's portrayal of the very tough Cagney along with Daly as a second woman lead, was making viewers uncomfortable that Cagney might be gay. Officially, the network explained Foster's replacement by saying they feared viewers might have trouble ""telling the two leads apart.""

Ratings remained low and the show was cancelled after only one season, but the saga was far from over. An unprecedented outpouring by fans who worked tirelessly to bring the show back on the air was rewarded by its return in 1984. It finally went off the air in 1988 after 125 series episodes, while four reunion movies followed.

The 22 of the first season episodes featuring Gless and Daly are on this set, along with a new two-part documentary about the show.

Cagney & Lacey redefined gender roles in TV dramas. Now, it hardly seems possible that a series starring two women leads would be a pioneer in overcoming the glass ceiling that prevented women from obtaining untraditional jobs, but it was. While another groundbreaking cop show, Police Woman, starring Angie Dickinson, should also be lauded, it was Cagney & Lacey that went much further in focusing the series spotlight on two professional women, and dealt directly with the sexism that they encountered among the public and within the own New York City police department. Eventually, Cagney was promoted to Detective Sergeant.

Through the years, the show also dealt with drug abuse, alcoholism, racism, rape, and balancing a home life while having a successful career. Daly was two win four Best Actress Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Lacey, while Gless won two of the coveted awards for Cagney.

The primary cast included Al Waxman as Lt. Bert Samuels, John Karlen as Harvey Lacey, Carl Lumbly as Detective Mark Petrie, Martin Kove as Detective Victor Isbecki, and Dick O'Neill as Charlie Cagney. Sidney Clute, who played Detective Paul La Guardia, was only in four episodes before passing away. Show creators and producers decided to leave his picture and name at the start of each episode for the remainder of the series as a tribute to the fine actor.

This set includes the following episodes: Witness to An Incident, One of Our Own, Beauty Burglars, High Steel, Hot Line, Internal Affairs, Mr. Lonelyhearts, Conduct Unbecoming, I'll Be Home For Christmas, Recreational Use, Hopes and Dreams, The Grandest Jewel Thief of Them All, Affirmative Action, Open and Shut Case, Jane Doe No. 37, Date Rape, Burn Out, Chop Shop, Let Them Eat Pretzels, The Gang's All There, A Cry For Help, and The Informant.

Let us hope that the remainder of the series, including the pilot and the Foster episodes, will also be released on DVD much sooner than it took for this first boxed set to be released.",1171497600,86,3457,4.948275862068965

The stories were very good, the characters were compelling, but the development of the respectful but challenging friendship between the two very different women (Tyne Daly as Mary Beth Lacey and Sharon Gless as Christine Cagney) is what made it truly outstanding.  There is a terrific ensemble cast.  My favorite other character is Marcus Petrie, played by Carl Lumbly.  He is anything but the stereotypical black cop, or, for that matter, a stereotypical white cop or white man or black man . . . . or whatever man.  He plays a kind and sincere man who has a loving relationship with his wife.  Harvey Lacey, played by John Karlen, is also a terrific character.",1460073600,2,710,4.778688524590164

2764967,5,B000NDEXO8,"This was one of television's best crime drama series ever with two of television's finest actresses, Tyne Daly (played Mary Beth Lacey) and Sharon Gless (played Christine Cagney). Ironically, Sharon Gless was the third actress to play Christine Cagney after Loretta Swit (in a television movie) and Meg Foster (in it's first 6 episodes).

Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless won 5 Emmys for their performances as Cagney and Lacey. It is easy to see why after a few minutes. The actresses and their characters work well together. Cagney is the single woman and daughter of a New York City police officer while Lacey is married to Harvey and a mother of two sons who lives in a crowded apartment in Queens, New York.

Despite their strong performances, there is an equally strong supporting cast of male characters like Al Waxman, Emmy winner John Karlen, Carl Lumbly, Martin Kove, and Martin Clute. The writing is strong and relevant to social and controversial issues like domestic violence, drugs, date rape, etc.

This series won plenty of well-deserved Emmys and Golden Globe awards during it's five year run on primetime television. For a series who fought to get on the air and stay there, this show displayed strong independent women like Cagney and Lacey. They became role models and symbols of what women could be in the world today as it was 30 years ago.

While watching the first season, I am awestruck at how I missed it. Perhaps, I was just too young to see it. If only the series was shown in syndication again to today's audiences, I am sure that they would want a more contemporary version of the series. Unfortunately, there is something sad about watching the series and it was seeing the old New York City skyline with the twin towers.",1412726400,3,1745,4.749174917491749

2764976,4,B000NDEXO8,"I'm a fan of buddy cop TV series, most notably NYPD Blue, the golden standard for all such shows. Cagney and Lacey rates 75% in scriptwriting, interest, dynamics among team members, and staging, 90% in acting. It is sweet and feminine in its approach to daily situations in fighting crime and the relationship between the main characters is similar to sisterhood.

One episode that dealt with burnout on the job was very much on the mark...Lacey is shown walking off the job and family to spend a day incommunicado at a beach where she meets a flakey woman spouting hippie sentiments about life. As with most TV episodes, this is wrapped up neatly with a bow in just 50 minutes, but it echoes many sentiments in the overworked professional mother.

For its time, it was progressive and even edgy at rare times. Compared to today's buddy cop genre, it is PG-sanitized, however. You can watch it with your preteen children, although questions they may ask can be a good opener for serious discussions, e.g. about predators.

A definite addition to my collection.",1339891200,,1060,4.813186813186813
2764977,5,B000NDEXO8,"This review is of the release of the first full season of this CBS police series, which, according to FOX Home Entertainment and MGM, is ""The True Beginning"" of the series. The series started as a TV movie by that name in 1981, with Loretta Swit (best known for ""M*A*S*H"") as Chris Cagney, and Tyne Daly as her partner, Mary Beth Lacey. ""Cagney & Lacey"" as a series premiered in March 1982 and ran for 6 outings on Thursdays from 9 to 10, with Meg Foster as Chris Cagney (Lacey was unchanged, as Tyne Daly still played that role). The ratings were very low for that 6-outing tryout, and so CBS tried again in the fall, changing to Sharon Gless for the role of Cagney. This time, the series went a full season of 22 outings on Mondays from 10 to 11 (1982-83, the season presented in this release), but ratings were very low over that run, and again the series was cancelled. This prompted an intense hue and cry from loyal viewers, and summer reruns in 1983 drew in new viewers who wanted to see what these remarkable women were like. Finally, CBS brought it back for good in March 1984, and it ran until August 1988.

In addition to the title characters, others included Lt. Bert Samuels (the late Canadian Al Waxman), boss of the 14th precinct in NYC where Cagney and Lacey worked; Detectives Petrie, Isbecki, and La Guardia (Carl Lumbly, Martin Kove, and the late Sidney Clute); Lacey's husband Harvey (John Karlen); and their sons Harvey Jr. and Michael (Tony La Torre and Troy Slaten).

Here are the 22 outings of this ""True Beginning"" release, as listed on the two slipcases:

Disc 1A:
""Witness to an Incident""
""One of Our Own""
""Beauty Burglars""
""High Steel""

Disc 1B:
""Hotline""
""Internal Affairs""

Disc 2A:
""Mr. Lonelyhearts""
""Conduct Unbecoming""
""I'll Be Home For Christmas""
""Recreational Use""

Disc 2B:
""Hopes and Dreams""
""The Grandest Jewel Thief of Them All""

Disc 3A:
""Affirmative Action""
""Open and Shut Case""
""Jane Doe #37""
""Date Rape""

Disc 3B:
""Burnout""
""Chop Shop""

Disc 4A:
""Let Them Eat Pretzels""
""The Gang's All There""
(Featurette: ""Breaking The Laws of TV, Part 1"")

Disc 4B:
""A Cry For Help""
""The Informant""
(Featurette: ""Breaking The Laws of TV, Part 2"")

The 22 outings of this ""True Beginning"" of ""Cagney & Lacey"" are presented on 4 double-sided discs as listed above; the first 3 have 6 outings apiece (4 on one side, 2 on the other), and the last one has the remaining 4 (2 on each side). The last disc also has a two-part documentary about the series (or at least this first full season's worth of it); each part is on one side of the last disc as listed above. The 22 outings have only English as an audio option, but English and Spanish subtitles are included, as are closed captions. The 4 discs are in 2 slipcases; each slipcase has the same image as the package, but there are episode listings on the other side of each case.

In short, this is a fine release of one of television's classic police dramas, and one with two outstanding actresses (at least IMO) in the leads, and therefore one that is worth a purchase, despite the omission of the 6-outing tryout of early '82 with Meg Foster.",1325462400,,3122,4.575268817204301

2764990,5,B000NDEXO8,"""Cagney and Lacey"" starred Sharon Gless  and Tyne Daly as police detectives Christine Cagney (Gless) and Mary Beth Lacey (Daly) who went onto win Emmy Awards for their roles on this dramatic series. The show premise is about these two people who happened to be female police officers, who had separate outside lives, who came together as partners and close friends in their profession. The story lines are still relevant, tackling many issues, and based on this truly the series hasn't really aged much. 'C&L' did a total run of 125 episodes over 6 years with this duo.

In regards to product their first season 22 episode DVD is well worth the purchase, although in my opinion it got even better in later seasons. This disc offers a bonus documentary that includes interviews with both of the leads, cast, the executive producer, and creator. The episode quality is clear and the packaging is fine.

That said I'm honestly hoping that the remainder of the 6 seasons are released and I'm looking forward to the movies they made in the 90's released in 2009. I'll be buying it!

These two ladies are terrific actresses who both could act the phone book. Tyne Daly's portrayal of Mary Beth Lacey is one I personally respect as I'm a working mom too.

2764992,5,B000NDEXO8,"These six episodes of Cagney & Lacey star Tyne Daly as Lacey and Meg Foster as Cagney. The Pilot movie (starring Tyne Daly and Loretta Swit as Cagney) was such a hit that they quickly produced 6 episodes for a series. The Producer wanted Sharon Gless to play Cagney, but she was under contract to Universal and unavailable. After these 6 episodes were completed the network (CBS) agreed to renew for another season on the condition that Sharon Gless play Cagney. Gless was released from her Universal contract and the rest is history. She went on to play Cagney for the remaining 6 seasons and either Daly (4) or Gless (2) won an Emmy for those six years.

Some say that this is the true Season 1, even though last year's studio release of episodes 7-28 is called ""Season 1"" (the first ""Gless as Cagney"" season). Episodes 1-6 are important as they lay the foundation for the series, and demonstrate how difficult it was for the lady cops to deal with their predominately male work environment while dealing with their other personal issues and homes lives.  This was not a cop show. It was about two women and their relationships and struggles in life.... they just happened to be cops.

This series consists of 125 episodes, the pilot movie, and four TV movies made after the series was cancelled. These are the first six episodes. They are an important part of history and a welcomed sight on Amazon.",1212278400,2,1402,4.645161290322581

Watching season one just gives you a little taste and makes you long for more episodes, even though you know the outcome of what is coming.  As the series advanced, the writing got better and better, along with character development.  Barney Rosenzweig really knew what he was doing and there will never again be another Cagney and Lacey.

2765002,5,B000NDEXO8,"""Cagney and Lacey"" was my favorite show back in the 80's, and it's still one of my favorite shows of all time.  Compelling story lines and top-notch acting combine to make a show that's entertaining to watch and hard to forget.  Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly traded honors of winning the best actress Emmy for a drama series every year during the run of the show, evidence of the high-caliber of acting that was routine for ""C&L.""

I was curious about the editorial review's comment about the show's ""dull moments"" and ""occasional descent into tedium.""  I have watched every season of ""Cagney & Lacey"" and cannot recall ever experiencing a ""descent into tedium.""  Certainly, watching Season 1 anew, I have not encountered any dull moments.  Does the show offer cliff-hanger, heart-stopping action every nanosecond?  No, because ""C&L"" is not just an action show.  The focus is more on developing engaging storylines and in-depth characterizations.  This is what sets it apart from a typical action series.  The viewer becomes involved in the characters' lives, their personalities, their relationships.  The chemistry between Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly as Detectives Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey is wonderful.  My eyes are glued to the screen when they are in a scene together--great stuff!

As for the DVD's themselves, the shows are on four double-sided discs.  Though I prefer single-sided discs, double-sided ones seem to be more common for hour-long shows, and these discs have performed flawlessly, so I have no complaints.  Disc four has two ""featurettes"" about the making of ""Cagney & Lacey,"" each a little under twenty minutes long.  Sharon Gless, Tyne Daly, producer Barney Rosenzweig, as well as other cast members, writers, etc., are interviewed about the show.  I enjoyed watching them, and it was interesting to see the cast members as they look today.

Barney Rosenzweig, the producer of the series, has said that MGM elected not to promote the DVD release of ""C&L,"" assuming that an older show is not going to be a big money maker anyway, and thus shooting itself in the foot as far as sales are concerned (that's my paraphrase).  And if sales of Season 1 are not good, MGM may not want to release further seasons of ""Cagney & Lacey.""  (Does anyone see a Catch-22 here??)  So, if you are considering buying Season 1 or think you would like to have the option of buying subsequent seasons of this classic show, I have one piece of advice:  BUY SEASON 1 TODAY!  I, for one, am prepared to purchase every season of ""Cagney & Lacey"" that comes out on DVD and will be profoundly disappointed if seasons two through six are not forthcoming.

If you enjoy quality entertainment, buy ""Cagney & Lacey - Season 1.""  You will not regret it!",1191974400,5,2749,4.860215053763441

Partners (detectives) working in a man's world is quite challenging.  These characters were an inspiration back in the '80s and, I believe, that they still are.
  I have been anxiously waiting for this to come out on DVD.  It has been years since I have found C&L being broadcast in syndication.  Well, I am not disappointed.  This set may not have any frills and is double-sided but the quality of the picture on my HGTV is excellent.  I enjoyed each and every episode.
  This is almost like a drug.  I am missing it already and want the next season.  I need a C&L fix.  I will purchase all episodes if MGM changes their minds and continues to release the rest of the seasons.  In the mean time, I am thinking of buying a bootleg version of the series.

I sincerely hope that the entire series is released.  My husband, who watched Monday Night Football while C&L was on in the 1980s, missed all of this wonderful series.  He watches the show with me now and loves it.  We are not fond of the television programs out there today (you cannot watch a police drama now  without gore and graphic violence) as the characters are not developed well.  We cannot watch most dramatic television now for fear our children will see it.  We can do that with C&L.  That was part of the beauty of C&L.  The story was not just about the police work.  We got to see the women outside of work and how work and family affected them. I cannot imagine why anyone would complain about the quality of the picture.  Give me a break.  It is a series that was filmed 25 years ago for television when home theatres and high definition where not even thought about.

I am confident that I am not the only one that would buy the series for myself and as a gift for other family members.  Please, don't stop with just these 22 episodes.",1186876800,2,1189,4.292792792792793

2765019,1,B000NDEXO8,"Ironically, this CAGNEY & LACEY set has the words, ""The True Beginning"" on it. But it is neither the beginning, nor is it true. C&L began as a TV-movie with Tyne Daly and Loretta Swit. When it was optioned as a series Swit was still committed to M*A*S*H, so the first six episodes had Meg Foster playing Cagney. The show did not catch on, with critics complaining the two characters were too similar. So, they brought in Sharon Gless, who looked different than Tyne and more like Loretta Swit. The chemistry worked and, after a slow start, the show became a success.

But this set, allegedly calling itself ""The First Season"" completely ignores the genesis of the show, starting it off with the second season episodes with Sharon Gless. The first episode makes you feel like you've been dumped into the middle of something already in progress, because that's exactly what's been done. The whole idea with DVD sets is to get the complete story - not a ""best of"" set, nor the edited versions you see on daily or weekly TV. By sweeping the pilot and the entire first season under the rug as if they never happened, the creators have robbed us of the very ""True Beginning"" of the show that they falsely claim this to be. I realize many people don't remember the Meg Foster episodes, or are even aware that they exist. But this set uses double-sided discs. It would have taken exactly one more disc to include the pilot and all six Meg Foster episodes. They could have called it ""The First and Second seasons"" as they did successfully with ""Quincy"" - which also had a limited first season run with episodes that differed from the version of the show that people eventually came to know. And if a fan had wanted to ignore the pilot and first season episodes, he or she could simply have started with Disc 2.

Other DVD sets include thing like unaired pilots and deleted scenes to show you more about the beginnings of a series. Here, whole episodes have instead become deleted and unaired. What a sad precedent. What next? Skipping the first season of MANNIX where he worked for Intertect? Starting THE AVENGERS with the Diana Rigg shows? Thank goodness this didn't do only the Jim Phelps episodes of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, or skip the early HAPPY DAYS where Richie had an older brother. Shame on all those who made the decision to ignore a portion of this show's history and then had the nerve to label this travesty ""The True Beginning!""",1184803200,22,2431,4.612009237875289

2765022,1,B000NDEXO8,"After receiving a ton of other DVDs of old TV shows, I came to expect a certain ""collectible quality"" to the discs and packaging. This set is sadly lacking in both areas.

It contains two plain discs in thin plastic holders. Both holders have the same photo and information on the front. Nothing distinguishes case one from case two.
Unlike other collectible sets that have colorful plastic discs, these discs are plain, silver colored and non-distinct. It's impossible to tell one disc from the other without a magnifying glass. To make things even worse, the discs are double-sided, so we're issued two instead of four.

This garbage is grossly overpriced at $25.99. Even the thrill of watching Cagney and Lacey again hasn't soothed the feeling of being cheated.

I'm really shocked and angered that other reviewers haven't taken issue with the cheap dollar store packaging and design. To comment only on the C&L show, which we all loved or we wouldn't be here, and not on the quality of the item itself defeats the purpose of these reviews. I reply heavily on Amazon's customer review section to make an informed decision before I buy. Many of these reviews were actually written BEFORE the product came onto the market. That's pathetic.

The picture is fine. The sound is fine. But if you care about quality and getting what you pay for, you may be highly disgusted with this dollar store quality DVD set.

2765025,5,B000NDEXO8,"I think this set is great!  I loved the TV show, I used to tape it on Lifetime years ago, when I worked and it was on during the day.  I really hope they come out with the rest of the seasons as well. I enjoyed it when they got more involved in the characters life outside of work in the later seasons. More home life, Lacey buying a house, Cagney's alcoholism, and relationship with her father & boyfriends. None of that is in this set, this is truely the beginning. Pretty straight forward police work, some of Lacey, Harvey and the kids, but not much, and it shows the women's interaction with other officers on the force. I like Sharon Gless as the only Cagney in this set. I could not warm up to the other woman who played the character in the first few episodes, I am glad she is not included. Good clean entertainment, not a lot of violence, no gore or bad language. It shows police woman trying to have a career and a private life. Tyne Daly is great as always.

2765026,1,B000NDEXO8,"I'm giving this only one star because in my opinion this is falsely advertised by the studio releasing the DVDs.  The time has come for the government to step in and set down laws for releasing films.  I am tired of paying two, three, and four times to see the same film or tv show.  First it comes out and scenes are missing.  Then it comes out again in a restored version. Then a directors cut.  Then again with lost footage found.  There needs to be a law passed that once a film is released in the theater THAT is the film.  Period.  No changes made.  THIS IS THE SECOND SEASON OF CAGNEY AND LACEY.  The first season started March 25, 1982 with actress MEG FOSTER playing the role of Cagney in the episode called ""You Call this Plain Clothes?"" and ended after six episodes with the final one being ""Better than Equal"".  What this set contains is season 2 which began October 25, 1982 with the episode ""Witness to an Incident"" and with Sharon Gless taking over the role of Detective Cagney.  Why didn't they just start the dvd release with the actual season one?  Why the lie?  Also, what about the original pilot movie for Cagney and Lacey that starred Loretta Swit?  What happened to that?  M*A*S*H* would not let her out of her contract to do the tv series so they got Meg Foster instead.  Why wasn't that included on this set as well?  I can just see them continuing to release this set and then a few years down the line it will be re-released with the original movie and the actual 1st season with Meg Foster  and then viewers will be expected to buy the series all over again.  Something needs to be done about this.  HOW CAN A STUDIO LEGALLY CALL THE SECOND SEASON THE FIRST SEASON?  I don't get it. Also, these are two sided discs which I am not a fan of either.  Two sided discs are usually trouble and seem more prone to damage.  So far I haven't had trouble with any of the discs.  I've watched a few episodes on some of the discs and they played well, but I still don't like two sided discs.  What is nice is that they included the little promo teaser that used to run before each episode.  A lot of dvd releases omit that but they're included here and that is a nice touch.  Also, the Featurette BREAKING THE LAWS OF TV - The Making of Cagney and Lacey was excellent.  Gless and Daly are both in it, along with several other major cast members and key production people recalling episodes and their experiences filming the series.  I just wish that as long as they had these people on camera, that some commentary tracks could have been produced to accompany some of the episodes.",1182211200,13,2597,4.338877338877339

But I have to say I think they made the right decision starting with these episodes. I still have my disintegrating VHS copies of the entire series, and MY season 1 has exactly these episodes - same order and everything! Many thanks to all involved for getting this series on DVD - PLEASE keep the seasons coming. Incredibly good writing, and the acting? What more can be said about Gless and Daly - they ARE Cagney and Lacey.",1180310400,,573,4.364485981308412
2765036,5,B000NDEXO8,"I just finished viewing the DVD set of C&L and enjoyed the episodes just as much now as I did when they first aired. I know there has been some flack about the pilot movie and the first six episodes with Meg Foster not being released first (or at least included on this set) but I agree with another reviewer who said that releasing Sharon Gless' first season is probably a marketing strategy to determine public interest. Of the three Cagney's, Gless is the most widely associated with the show and therefore, the most marketable. Hopefully sales will be high enough to merit the release of every season, including the pilot film, Foster's episodes and the reunion movies.

As far as the DVD set goes, it features great cover art on the box. There are four DVDs inside with episodes on both sides of each DVD (I actually prefer discs where the episodes are all on one side but that's a minor quibble and I'm sure that four discs [as opposed to six] was cheaper to produce). There's also a featurette, ""Breaking the Laws of TV"" which explains C&L's evolution. Although it's a great ""extra"", it's broken up into two parts, with one part being on one side of the last disc and the second part being on the flip side. It would be much more convenient to have it all as one feature on one side....but again, another minor quibble. I didn't notice any edited episodes (but it's been quite a while since I've seen the original airings, so who knows).

Overall, a pretty good package and hopefully the first of the entire series (Loretta and Meg included)!",1179964800,10,1549,4.548387096774194
2765037,5,B000NDEXO8,"BUY THIS!!! If you are a fan of C&L or fans of Gless and/or Daly from other projects or if you just like good old fashioned drama, then this series if for you.  This show is character driven. It was made before all the focus became on technical stuff like autopsies and ""crime scene investigation""...before the MTV Generation with shaky cameras, lightning fast scene-jumping for those plagued with TV-induced ADD, and no real character development.  This show isn't really about cops and robbers. It's about the lives of two smart, lovely, real women, best friends, who have to balance their families, careers, and each other.  You'll get interesting stories and award winning acting in every episode.

Some of you are disappointed that they didn't include the first season with Meg Foster.  Maybe that will come, but personally, Sharon Gless is the only Cagney to me, the one I loved in the role.

For those of you who are C&L fans already, please buy this!  It's what we've been waiting for for so many years.  From what I understand, Barney Rosenzweig, who produced the original series, is pushing hard to get the DVDs released. If the the fan support is there and the sales are good, the entire series, complete with the TV movies and Meg Foster's Cagney, will eventually be realeased. Go Barney!",1179705600,6,1300,4.798206278026906
2765038,5,B000NDEXO8,"...but I posit that (A) since Gless is whom Avedon, Corday & Rosenzweig wanted for the role from the beginning (but couldn't get her, as she was under contract to another series at the time), and (B) since Gless' portrayal of Cagney is most widely associated with the series, this market-testing release of the episodes beginning with Gless as Cagney is appropriate-- and is probably the best success-insuring move for an initial DVD release, if we ever want to see the rest of the series in this form.  (And we do, WE DO!)

I think Mr. Barney Rosenzweig knows what he's doing, here.  Perhaps the pilot (with Loretta Swit) and the ""first"" season (with Meg Foster-- dubbed season zero by some) will be released together in some sort of pre-series package down the road, especially for collectors and hard-core fans.  But for now, I dare say that the seasons most people want to see are the ones we came to love with Sharon Gless.

Somewhat grainy, yes they are, in this first package.  I understand that it's pricey and tedious to clean 25-year-old negatives from a predigital era.  I think they look fine, even on my HDTV, and even showing their age the way they do-- I'm just glad to have them at all, preserved in this format, at my fingertips.  So hey, they're a great deal online-- you won't be sorry, and buying them will send a message that yes, in fact, we do want to see the rest of this series on DVD!",1179619200,4,1410,4.5019607843137255

I enjoyed every minute of it.  I am from the UK and ordered from the States as I couldn't wait for June for it to be released here!

Buy it, you won't be disappointed!  Great acresses and great stories.

2765040,5,B000NDEXO8,"""Cagney & Lacey"" is my all-time favorite show.  I haven't seen it in years, and I've sorely missed it.  Now, I have it on DVD, and it's just as good as I remember it being.  It's such a great drama with strong female leads who could be tough, but also vulernable.  It's also a testament to the value of close friendship. The acting could not be better! Many thanks to Mr. Rosenzweig, Ms. Gless, Ms. Daly, and to everyone else who pushed this DVD release or was involved in its original production.  Please keep the DVDs coming!  And please don't make us wait too long!",1179446400,3,568,4.3619047619047615
2765041,4,B000NDEXO8,"I eagerly opened this set I received today and discovered that the 1st season is a little short.  Why would they not include the original episodes with Meg Foster in this supposedly complete first season?????  Fans realize there was a cast change, and although Sharon Gless proved to be a great Cagney, I still would have liked to see those earlier episodes.  I hope they at least consider releasing them separately.  Given how long we had to wait for this release, I think it probably not likely we'll ever see those.",1179100800,5,518,4.65934065934066
2765042,5,B000NDEXO8,"The First Season set of the series is out and it may not be the ""original"" maybe sometime we can get the Pilot and Original First Season, Still this Set is well worth it. It even contains the ORIGINAL closing card orion title card! I was surprised it wasn't replaced. Little details like that show that someone was thinking about the show form the vantage point of a fan or in my case someone who hasn't seen the show in years in fact barely remembers it! So this show is really good, great writing and great acting from Tyne and Sharon. I hope Fox/ MGM doesn't drop the ball on releasing more seasons in a good time window.",1178582400,4,624,4.296610169491525
2765043,5,B000NDEXO8,"I absolutely loved this show when it aired in the 80's and it holds up just as well today thanks to great acting and terrific scripts.  I hope the show finds a new audience in it's DVD release - those born too late to enjoy the initial run of the show don't know what they're missing!  Tyne and Sharon totally dominated the Best Actress Drama category of the Emmy Awards during the show's six-year run - no other actress stood a chance.  They were phenomenal.  The ups and downs of Chris and Mary-Beth's partnership/friendship kept me absolutely riveted.  It was the realistic portrayal of the two ""WOMEN who happened to be cops"" that had me hooked from the beginning.  I'm anxiously awaiting my Mother's Day present - the DVD along with Producer Barney Rosenzweig's long-awaited book, CAGNEY & LACEY ... AND ME.",1178323200,5,812,4.683098591549296
2765044,5,B000NDEXO8,"I can understand why people are not happy that Meg Foster is not included since she was the original Cagney. I never really took to her character on this CBS drama series but I did enjoy it when Sharon Gless was added. I think she added a bit sassy-ness and was probably not you're ""stereo-typical"" female New York city detective. It will be glad to see the character who played Harvey,Lacey's husband. I felt he was an excellent actor and probably should have gotten a little more recognition. If you ever watched ""Third Watch"",the female police officer character who was married reminded me alot of Detective Lacey.",1177977600,6,617,4.775700934579439
2765045,5,B000NDEXO8,"I'm glad this is finally coming out but like other posts I agree this is not season 1 its season 2!

I don't see why the pilot movie with Loretta Swit and Tyne Daly and more particularly the first six episodes with Meg Foster as Chris Cagney aren't included on this DVD set.

I haven't seen the Meg Foster episodes for over 20 years and I'd like to see Ms Foster's performance as the feeling was she dropped because of the pressure from the network that Cagney might be thought of as gay and that Meg Foster in general,got a raw deal.

The paring of Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless was of course ideal but like a lot of C AND L fans,I get annoyed that the Meg Foster episodes are being ignored.",1177804800,11,689,4.165413533834586
