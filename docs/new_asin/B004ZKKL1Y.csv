4509755,5,B004ZKKL1Y,"Webster is one of those shows that I loved as a kid in the 80s, but it wasn't shown much on tv since.  I had a couple of episodes on tape that I watched over the years.  I bought the first few seasons on dvd.  I've been watching the third one and I think the show holds up well.  It's funny, weird, and sad at times.  It reminds me of Punky Brewster in some ways.  Teaching lessons and showing that family is important.  If you love 80s sitcoms you should enjoy Webster.

Be sure to check out the really cheesy episode called ""Almost Home"".  It was supposed to be a pilot for a spin-off, but it never got picked up.  It has a lot of bad acting and bad writing.  But it's also funny at times.",1339891200,,691,4.007352941176471

8450068,5,B004ZKKL1Y,I'm so thrilled to have found Webster on dvd. I've always wanted to have a collection of my own. I enjoy showing these shows to my children. It's NOT all the filth they show now days. I enjoy watching shows that are more family friendly. Shows without all the nudity. I wish the shows now days wasn't as trashy. The shows from back in the day was put together much better than now days. The shows now days are nothing like what I & others enjoyed watching. They take everything too far.. It's crazy. I will continue to buy shows like this for my family to enjoy.. I really enjoy watching these family friendly shows. They are the BEST EVER!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend. Great Product..........,1374192000,,692,4.544
