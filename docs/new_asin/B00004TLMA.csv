7922968,3,B00004TLMA,"This episode appears after the events of ""Gravity Jailbreak"" and before ""Cutting The Galatic Leyline""
 But cartoon network skiped over it and went from ""gravity jailbreak"" straight to ""cutting the galatic leyline""
 The show starts out with a brief history about the Hot Springs Planet and tells how 3 people came and turned it into a tourist attraction.
 Gene and company, arrive at the planet, The gang for some fun and relaxation, Gene for the 3 rare caster shells needed to complete the set of 20 caster shells to use to battle the unknown in the Galatic Leyline.
 Gene and company (after a brief recap on their fact finding mission to find the wizards who can make the 3 rare caster shells) board a train to the hot springs resort.
 The gang does have some fun in the hot springs, Jim finds himself the center of attention of 5 lovely ladies, Melfina and Suskia relax in a hot spring, but Asisa has a semi-hard time trying to find a spring hot enough for her. She finally finds one that looks like a bubbling lava pit.
 Gene on the other hand finally finds 2 of the wizards he is looking for and after getting a brief history on the origins of the caster gun and shells, agrees to the proposal that the wizards offer him for two of the three rare caster shells.
 Gene's trips up the mountain is funny and his 3 failed trips back down the mountain is something out of a Wile E cartoon.
 Gene finally gets the third and last rare caster shell from the third wizard and at the same time fulfills the deal he made with the other 2 wizards.
 Armed with the 3 rare caster shells, Gene rejoins the gang and head back to the Outlaw Star to tackle the mysteries of the Galatic Leyline.

 Part 2 of the tape starts off with a roll call of all heroes, villians and starships. With that complete, the Galatic Leyline is now open for business.
 After watching the failed attempt of Asisa's people entering the Galatic Leyline and returning half-mad, Gene sets course for the center of the Galatic Leyline. Right on his tail are the McDougle Brothers and the Kei Pirates.
 All three ships make it into the center of the Galatic Leyline and as Melfina and Gene disappear in a flash of light by the Guardian of the Galatic Leyline, the remainder of the cast are left (in what would be called a mexican stand off) staring at each other, waiting for the other person to make the first move.

 There is some minor cursing and three scenes where a computer generated bikini wouldn't have helped censor the action. There are some funny moments to break up the tension of the story. Plus certain subject matters would have been diffcult for kids under 13 to understand and extremely embarassing for parents to explain to them.
 The bonus is that you get to see the a TV trailer for Outlaw Star at the end of the second show.",1026864000,2,2806,4.440545808966862
7922969,5,B00004TLMA,Cartoon Network couldn't sensor this one so it was not shown on TV.  If the US were Japan the little kiddies would have seen soft core porn.  The episode is very funny but the story is about Gene getting Castor shells.  I figure its the last comical show before the final three that takes them to the Layline.  Every Outlaw Star video is worth getting.  (I have the whole collection.)  And for those of you who have seen it on Cartoon Network; once you see the real stories on video you will feel like you are watching a totally different show.,987120000,10,544,4.336633663366337
