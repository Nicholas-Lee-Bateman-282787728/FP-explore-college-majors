1803371,1,B00007AJE3,"Sylvester Stallone is a coming of age Academy Award nominated Actor/Screenwriter, A legendary Action star, and a Hollywood heavy who has lasted over 25 yearsin the spotlight. His newest feature 'Eye See You', however, is a bad movie.
First of all, it lacked any character development. The first scene has Stallone's character Fed Cop Jake Malloy buying a ring for his lovebird. That scene immediately takes you to Malloy with his cop buddies talking about a slasher who is killing cops. Then, one of the buddies gets home and gets killed, then Malloy goes home to his lovebird, and the next morning he gets a call about his buddy's death, he heads to the scene, gets a phonecall from the slasher as he's breaking into his house and killing his lovebird. All in the first 10-15 minutes! Where's the logic? Where the character background? Why is this happening? Nobody knows.
Next, Malloy goes into a deep depression where he turns into an alcoholic and comits suicide. This behaviour ends Malloy up at a detox unit for troubled cops. And here is where the poorly rated fun begins. A snow blizzard hits the area, breaking any contact between the detox unit and the outside world. Malloy is stuck in detox with a dozen other cops and one of them is the slasher.
By the end when you find out who the slasher is, you have no idea what brought him there, why he is killing cops, and why he has harrassed Malloy.???
This movie is forgettable. Very poor script at worst. And Sly's acting is nowhere near Rocky status. Just the same old puppy eyed look on his face and the same snarly voice. The worst is where Stallone crys over his lovebird's death, it's more aching for the viewer to watch him overact than it is crying over the lover. That's how bad this movie is!
I wonder where has Stallone of 1976 gone? Was it a strike of good luck that turned him into a star? Only the rest of his time will reveal that secret!
Eye See You final words: don't See it unless you really feel like watching another Stallone movie.
Not recommended

1803372,3,B00007AJE3,"Why has this movie gotten such a bad rap?! I enjoyed this film. The last three movies I have seen are ""XXX"" and ""Blood Work"", and this movie.  Of the three ""Eye See You"" was by far the best movie!  It is a shame that this did not make it into theatres. this is Stallones best film in a long time. ""Driven"" and ""Get Cater"" are Stallone movies that deserved the straight to video route but not this!  This movie is not a msaterpiece but it is a good movie and totally enjoyable.  I recommend Stallone fans check this one out. Although I must say there is one laughable scene, its when he is having a nightmare, you will know what I am talking about when you see it, and I hope you do take the time to check it out.",1041897600,2,712,4.028368794326241

1803374,1,B00007AJE3,"First of all, i want to say that i was a stallone fan for many years  but sadly his decisions(apparently deciding to retire from action films and refusing a 20 million dollar paycheck)after the great 1996 film DAYLIGHT left somewhat to be desired. Stallone was a great action hero and i looked forward to his high profile movies(usually 2 each year)but now stallone is just a shadow of himself and his latest films have not been up to pass quality and standards. After viewing this EYE SEE YOU film,its not at all hard to understand why it was on the self for so long. Finished in 1999,it was only released outside the important usa/canada market in ....2002!This is simply a sad piece of violent filmmaking with very few bright spots which truely deserved to be unsuccessful and its another faux pas in stallone s career.",1041379200,4,822,4.6689655172413795

1803376,2,B00007AJE3,"Another thriller/ slash trash movie from the director of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and starring Hollywood's greatest method actor Sylvester ""Wam ham slam!"" Stallone.
After his wife is brutally slain by a psychotic driller killer, FBI agent Sly attends a Detox center for burnt out action heroes... uh, I mean cops; which just happens to be located in a remote mountain area. Predictably they get snowed in and after other patients start getting murdered, Sly comes to the brilliant conclusion that there is a maniac loose in the center. D-TOX is a lot better than DRIVEN but there's still awful dialogue. ie. Cop to Sly: ""Whatsa matter Malloy?, ya used to be one of us before you became a Fed"". There is also an impaling scene stolen directly from Stallone's CLIFFHANGER. But dat's jist some DAY-ZHA-VOO know what I'm sayin'? Still, things could be worse. At least he hasn't made ROCKY 6... yet.",1038355200,4,901,4.782051282051282
1803377,5,B00007AJE3,"I was supposed to have the first review. ""Eye See You"" a.k.a. ""D-Tox"" stars Sylvester Stallord. His character goes to rehab after he falls into a deep depression. Bad job, bad life. Peasants (common-folk) know how that feels. A killer does a number on patients in the hospital and Jake Malloy (Stallone) goes after him. This is the first Stallone movie to go straight-to-video and it's a shame, a mortal sin that it didn't play in the theaters. Stallone is immortal.",1037404800,6,466,4.765432098765432
1803378,5,B00007AJE3,"There are always the pseudo critics who know more than us -so they say. But, hey, watch this movie to have your own opinion. Stallone makes the movie. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers: there are very few actors out there with his cinematic presence. Don't just rent it, buy the DVD. The atmosphere is good, so is the photography and music, and it does have Sly in it too. Only that alone makes it worthwhile.",1037232000,4,423,4.3
1803379,5,B00007AJE3,"For some weird reason, this movie opened in theatres down here in Mexico some months ago , skipping tha opening in the USA for reasons that only the distributors know. Maybe they think that it is too mediocre or even bad to risk money promoting it. Well, the movie is not bad at all. It is actually pretty good; it doesn't try to reinvent the genre or to be the most original flick of the decade, but there are still great things about it. The biggest quality of it is that it stars Mr. Sylvester Stallone. He is a legend, he has a strong cinematographic persona, and it is obvious that he made an effort in this one. He plays a burnt out cop, a fed who hasn't been able to catch a serial killer, a cop killer. It is understood that he is not a superhero, he is a regular cop, someone who has problems doing his job (don't we all?), he hasn't been able to do what he was supposed to do, and when the killer focuses on him and the one he loves (Michael Corleone said: when they come for you, they come for what you love), he just breaks. He splits. He's then sent to rehab, in the mountains. What a surprise that, in the rehab center, there's a killer doing his own. It doesn't sound very original, I know, but check Sly out: he lost a lot of weight to play the part, his eyes tell you how really hurt he is, how much he has suffered, how desperate he is. Please, give him a chance. I do believe that it is us the fans who must support the guys who have given us so much fun all these years. Buy the DVD, recommend it, you will NOT regret it.",1036108800,14,1541,4.055737704918033

And a halfway house for cops in an almost windowless building isolated  in snow blizzard country with a bad boiler and bad generator, not to mention no regular snow plough through there?

Tom Berrenger is second billed, an initial draw for me but his number of lines can be counted on your fingers. He mostly stsnds around and looks dumb. Huge waste of his talent.",1372896000,,614,4.828571428571428

Score: 1/5 nothing I can remember
Action: 2/5 packed, yet it did not grab me in any way
Scenery: 2/5 nothing pleasing; the building where they filmed the movie is artistic though

1803478,3,B00007AJE3,"Being Stallone's big fan since a long, long time, I usually like to watch him even in his weaker films - and God knows he did some VERY bad ones (remember this ""Cobra"" thingy?). Although expecting a lot, I found that this film was at best a rather average thriller/slasher/action movie. I did not regret watching it, but thinking about all the lost opportunities to make a real masterpiece made me really sad.

It is hardly a spoiler to say that most of the film happens in a very peculiar detoxication center, specialising in help to police officers, who other than addiction often have also mental issues. Because of events in the first 15 minutes of the film, Stallone's character (FBI agent Jake Malloy) is not only an alcoholic but he is also suicidal. In the detox center other patients all have serious issues too - one of them is disfigured because when trying to kill himself he was so high, that he just managed to blow his cheek in pieces... And then, one of the patients dies, apparently by killing himself... And after that things go south really, really fast...

The film has some strong points. The cast is amazing, as other than Stallone himself, we have Kris Kristofferson, Tom Berenger, Robert Patrick (T-1000 from Terminator 2, also known as the ""The Liquid Metal Guy"" ), Charles S. Dutton (who played Dillon in ""Alien3""), Courtney B. Vance (ADA Carver in Law and Order Criminal Intent), Stephen Lang (well before he became worldwide known by playing Colonel Qaritch in ""Avatar"") and Robert Prosky (remember the desk sergeant in ""Hill Street Blues"", the one who said every morning to the cops ""now go and do to them what you wouldn't want them to do to you""?). But sadly, finally rather little use is done with this huge mass of combined talent and ugly mugs... In the first part of the film we can briefly admire Dina Meyer (remember Dizzy Flores in ""Starship Troopers""?) and by casting her Stallone made a perfect choice - but her screen time is sadly rather limited... Of all those good actors, only Robert Patrick is used to some extent accordingly to his potential.

The facility itself, which is a kind of former NORAD command bunker on the top of an isolated mountain, also offered a great place of action and some of its potential was well used. Placing the whole story in the middle of winter and start a furiously raging blizzard soon after all patients arrived were also good ideas.

However the scenario is ultimately rather weak. Interactions between all those colourful characters are reduced to little else than some screaming and stereotypical arguing. There is almost no humor. Once things start to turn badly people make all kind of most absurd decisions, especially walk a lot with guns in their hands ALONE in the dark maze of bunker corridors, without any apparent reason other than allowing somebody (or something) to kill them. Last but not least, the mystery is revealed too early and in a way which I didn't find very logical.

This could have been a great thriller, but its potential was in great part wasted. Being a huge Stallone's fan, I do not regret that I watched it, but I do not think I am going rewatch it anytime soon. And if you are not one of Sly's devoted fans, you risk to be even more disappointed - so watch it at your own risk.",1349654400,,3289,4.634648370497427
1803506,1,B00007AJE3,"My suggestion is not to let the kids watch this before they go to sleep, even more so not during the day either. Violence is one thing but this goes beyond violence and shows a psychopath on a killing cops and women rampage. Not just your run of the mill rampage but a horrific almost realistic look at how he commits his crimes, i.e. drilling a hole through the eye hole and into the eye of the looker, e gad, get me out of here. Totally unrealistic half way house in Siberian Alaska, where cops go to work out their problems, but slowly die off from suicide or is it the psychopath that has found them--- give me a break.

It could have been better if done right. Definitly one of Stallone's worst. Skip this one. Believe me you don't want to sit through this garbage.",1306022400,2,410,4.074074074074074
1803510,1,B00007AJE3,"Amazingly, this dull and incoherent flick cost $60 million!  Maybe that's 'low budget' in Hollywood, but the same $$$ could have financed 100 or more better indie movies.  I try to avoid watching drivel like this, but it caught me by surprise ... a friend told me he thought this was Stallone's best movie.  I'm not a Stallone fan, but I really hope my friend was wrong; this is a really bad movie.

The plot is dirt-simple and as unencumbered by side-stories or character development as your favorite Mother Goose rhyme.  So it should be a pretty easy story to tell.  Well, apparently not ... at least not for Jim Gillespie, the director.  His big success was ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,""  but after seeing ""Eye See You,"" I suspect Gillespie's modest success with 'Last Summer' was mostly due to the screenwriter, Kevin Williamson, who also wrote the ""Scream"" movies and the TV show, ""Dawson's Creek.""  Unfortunately, there's no Kevin Williamson on this lame flick.

A few points:

Originally called ""D-Tox,"" this movie was filmed in 1999, but was so poorly received by the execs at Universal (not exactly an art house studio) that they sat on the U.S. release until 2002, when, renamed as ""Eye See You,"" it was given a 'limited' theatrical run, then went directly to video.  (Hey, you can run but you can't hide: this really is a $60M Universal Studios movie...!  And it totally sucks!)

There was an obvious decision to film this flick entirely in shades of battleship-grey and, for visual excitement, steel-blue.  I'm serious -- look for a primary color in this movie (other than blood).  This can be a good visual device, and other (generally better) movies have worked within a limited color palette.  But, if the visuals are dull and the plot is dull, as is the case here, ya probably got yourself a dull movie.

And that's what we got:  one dull movie, with no redeeming factors.  It's not even ""camp,"" except in execution.",1305504000,,1937,4.708333333333333
1803511,1,B00007AJE3,"Eye See You (D-Tox) stopped being watchable once you got past the start.  The premise of the movie had potential, but somewhere along the way of actually putting this idea on film, something went horribly wrong.

A cop (Stallone) becomes a wash down and is sent to a snow covered rehab for cops in the remote wilderness of Siberia, where his victorious rival (for reasons that make no sense) is also taking up residence.

Despite the list of magnificently dull actors, the film still flops, as the plot is overly paltry. Character development is abject (they all die too quickly). There is no suspense. Scenes are pasted and cut together without any transition.  It is wrought with cliches, stereotypical characters and feebleminded acting from each actor in this film.

I am in approval of the people with the unfavorable reviews, as this is one of Sly Rockhead's worst movies.",1286150400,,878,4.865771812080537

This was a big mistake, as I consider ""Eye See You"" one of Stallone's best films.

""Eye See You"" is about F.B.I. Agent Jake Malloy. (Stallone) He is assigned to the case of a cop-killer. While Malloy is investigating a new murder, he gets a call from the killer himself. The killer is at Malloy's house, and we can see him ringing the door-bell. When Malloy gets home, he finds his wife hanging dead in the living room.

The grief sends Malloy off the deep end and causes him to become alcoholic, forcing Malloy's colleague, Detective Hendricks, to sign Malloy up at a remote detox clinic in a snow-covered part of Wyoming. The clinic specializes in rehabilitating alcoholic cops. But the killer murders another patient and assumes the patient's identity at the clinic. While Malloy participates in group therapy sessions, the killer starts killing the patients. Among the endangered patients are Jaworski, Slater, Noah, Conner, and a dozen others, one of whom must be the killer. One by one, the patients start falling prey to the killer and, starting with the facility's director, Doc, the killer starts targeting the staff as well. Stallone is good in the lead role experiencing a wide range of emotions. Director Jim Gillespie gives you a murder mystery rather than an action movie.

1803515,3,B00007AJE3,"3 of 5 stars for the cop-killing psycho suspense movie Eye See You. When I first read the product description I thought that this would be a great movie. Then I put it into the DVD player thinking oh this wasn't going to be good. Well, I watched it and decided it was actually good. So, we have Stallone in the role of a cop trying to track down a cop killer. Early-on the psycho goes after Stallone's family. That pushes his character into serious mental problems for which he needs help at a remote snow-covered group hospital in the middle of nowhere. The hospital specializes in helping cops with problems (drinking, drugs, mind). So rather than spoil it, let's just say this becomes a good creepy suspense movie.

Very interesting settings for the hospital. Well acted. Stallone showed good maturity as an actor by not over-powering te movie or other charaters. Well made suspense movie. Worth watching and I do recommend it.",1259798400,,930,4.705521472392638

An excellent cast is wasted in a poorly made slasher-fest that defies credulity.

1803517,3,B00007AJE3,"I'm not sure if they could have come up with a worse title if they tried, but if you can make it past that, then this actually isn't a bad little thriller.

The cast is top notch with Stallone, Tom Berenger, Charles Dutton, Robert Patrick and they even pull Kris Kristofferson and Rance Howard out of mothballs too. It's almost a shame that this cast wasn't given a top notch script to work with.

The basic storyline, which we've all seen before, is that a cop (Stallone) draws the attention of a lunatic. The lunatic decides to come after the cop and his family. Where ""Eye See You"" gains some originality, is when Stallone is sent to a detox facility in the snowy mountains. A group of cops who are having a tough time dealing with their jobs are gathered together in an old bunker as kind of support group. Of course, one of the cops is an imposter, and is actually the lunatic who has chosen Stallone as his next target.

The snowy bunker set deep in the mountains is a great setting. The bunker with its stark concrete walls and poor lighting add to the atmosphere as well. I think the biggest problem with ""Eye See You"" (besides that awful title) is that the story moves along too quickly. This type of film works best when it goes at a slower pace, building suspense. ""Eye See You"" just clicks along so fast, it's almost as if they are afraid to slow things down, and instead of building mystery and tension, they rush right into another murder or action scene. The supporting characters are barely distinguishable, which means that you can't really involve yourself guessing who the killer may be.

I wasn't expecting much, and was nicely surprised by ""Eye See You"". If you want to pick this up for a 90 minute diversion, you could do much worse, just be sure to keep your expectations low.",1242604800,,1799,4.475609756097561

The critics savaged this movie calling it a turkey and worse.  Imagine my surprise when I kept watching it!  I got hooked.  After reading what the critics had said about ""Eye See You"" I almost feel guilty for liking it.

This is a gripping thriller.  It's an underrated movie that I never heard of.  Was it ever released in theaters or did it go directly to DVD?  In any case, it reminds me of Agatha Cristie's ""Ten Little Indians"" as everyone starts getting murdered.  The premise of ""Eye See You"" is intriguing--a bunch of cops with emotional problems become stalked by a homicidal maniac in a secluded, snowed-in asylum.  I'm not a big Stallone fan but it doesn't matter here.  The entire cast is good, regardless of whether you like Stallone.  It's unfortunate that this movie was deep-sixed by the critics.

1803527,4,B00007AJE3,"Not counting Rocky Balboa, which just hit the theaters a week-and-a-half ago, it's been a long time since I've seen Sylvester Stallone in a movie I really enjoyed.  The only reason I ordered Eye See You was because the premise of a serial killer hunting down cops seemed so intriguing.  I have to admit to not expecting very much from the movie.  I figured it would simply be another throw away, but boy was I surprised.  I found myself caught up in the film within the first few minutes and then trying to guess whom the killer really was throughout the rest of the movie.  While not great, Eye See You is much better than most viewers might think, considering that it was never released theatrically inside the United States.

The movie centers around Stallone playing Jake Malloy, an F.B.I. agent whose fianc has just been murdered by the serial killer (a brilliant psycho that usually chooses cops as his victims) he's trying to catch.  Traumatized by the event, Malloy turns to alcohol as a way of dealing with his inability to save the woman he loved.  His close friend and fellow agent, Hendricks (played by Charles Dutton), eventually gets him into a very special rehab center that's geared directly toward cops and their situations.  The center is run by an ex-cop (Kris Kristofferson) and is located in an old military facility that's been vacated out in the wilds of Wyoming.  As one might guess, there are male cops and female cops, along with white cops, black cops, and Puerto Rican cops, not to mention American cops, British cops, and an old Canadian Royal Mounted Policeman who's played by Robert Prosky.  All the police officers have experienced some kind of trauma in their lives and are trying to deal with it in their own unique way, the common denominators being alcohol and drugs.  The catch here is that one of the cops is not who he seems to be and before long the group of people begin to drop like flies as they're mysteriously killed off.  It doesn't take Jake Malloy long to realize that the man who killed his fianc is now at the facility, playing a deadly game of cat and mouth with him.  Who will live and who will die are the big questions facing Malloy as he gets himself together in an effort to face the killer who changed his life forever.

My actual rating for Eye See You is more like 3   stars,  But, since I couldn't put that, I opted for going to four stars because the movie has such an excellent cast (Tom Berenger, Charles Dutton, Courtney Vance, Robert Patrick, Kris Kristofferson, and Robert Prosky) and proved to be a delightful surprise to me after I'd just watched three clunkers in a row.  Stallone's role also proved to be more character driven than many of his past ones, giving him an opportunity to display his acting chops.  And, believe it or not, Stallone is a decent actor when he has the right material to work with.  The movie was filmed entirely in British Columbia as a lot of TV movies are today.  The daylight photography is beautiful, but three-fourths of movie is either filmed at night, or inside the cold, stark, lifeless facility.  The extras on the DVD include several deleted scenes and interviews with all of the main cast members, except for Sylvester Stallone.  I have no idea why Stallone isn't interviewed when it could've been so easily done during the filming of the movie.  Still, all in all, Eye See You proved to be a fun experience, and I certainly don't mind adding it to my film collection.  Last, but not least, if you really want to see Stallone in top form, go see his newest film, Rocky Balboa.  It goes back to the quality and acting of the first ""Rocky"" movie.",1167523200,11,3651,4.568356374807988

1803530,4,B00007AJE3,"This film makes a very intriguing blend of action, psychological thriller, horror, crime drama, and mystery. It contains elements of a wide range of differing genres, but still remains coherent. The problem with such a fusion is that you inevitably won't appease devotees of any one specific genre; rather, most will be put off by the presence of other less familiar genres. ""Eye See You"", is a unique and claustrophobic venture that is almost as unorthodox as the rehab facility in which it's set.

The direction of this film certainly doesn't break any new ground, or explore unconventional techniques in order to create a one-off atmosphere, but it does have a certain eerie charm, even if slightly vapid at times. In the end, the fitly selected filming location made up for a more-or-less garden-variety directorial exertion.

What stands out most in this film is Sly's spot-on portrayal of a man going cold turkey after an extended period of constant drunkenness; he really captured those first couple of days quite expertly (although not for nearly long enough). After his trembling, nuanced interpretation of an alcoholic during the detoxification process, Stallone returns to his action hero origins and takes charge as only he knows how. Then, a truly well plotted whodunit ensues!

""Eye See You"" is best suited to film enthusiasts, not fans of a specific genre. The minor flaws are more than compensated for by the many strong points, solidly earning it a 7/10.",1118620800,4,1471,5.045267489711934

The all-star cast makes this movie entertaining and chalk full of great actors who know how to act! The story itself is original and very suspensefull! Perhaps the best one I have seen to date!
This title is one of the more gruesome Stallone films with people's eyes getting drilled (although you don't actually see it happen but you do see the aftermath) and people getting their throats cut and what have ya. Definately not for the person with a touchy stomach.

Then it goes off its beam a little, including a puzzling scene where Stallone shoots a man hanging, with duct tape over his mouth.  Did they think this was the serial killer?  Got me.  Anyway switch to a remote detox clinic in Wyoming (actually a beautifully filmed British Columbia) run by the lifeless Kris Kristofferson.  Here Stallone is joined by a series of cops who are also suffering their personal demons:  Robert Patrick is an obnoxious beefed up bore; Robert Prosky brings a little dignity to his role as an aging cop who supposedly deserted his partner who got killed; Sean Patrick Flannery in a brief but intense role as a cop who witnessed an explosion that killed 20+ children; Christopher Fulford as a British cop with a fear of the dark; Courtney B. Vance who spoke so soft I'm not sure what his role was, other than being the ""religious one"".  Jeremy Wright and Ms. Alvarado were wasted in non-dimensional roles.  Polly Walker was pretty as Jenny, although her range was limited.  Charles S. Dutton played every cop you've ever seen including Dennis Franz.  And why Tom Berenger as a handyman?  Director Gillepsie did everything he could to point the murder finger at Berenger.
So what's good?  Stallone, amazingly, does a pretty convincing job, a low-key but intense portrayal.  The cinematography is gorgeous, giving the winter scenery both a breathtaking beauty and an ominous evil.  And the finale is very well executed.

1803535,4,B00007AJE3,"Why the studio wouldn't release this film to theatres, and instead choose the direct-to-video path, is beyond me.  This is a good film.  Stallone turns in one of his most heartfelt performances here; if you're looking for ""Tango and Cash 2"", look elsewhere.

Playing FBI agent Malloy, Stallone's character is hunted by a sadistic serial killer, the film's antagonist.  Malloy's fiancee is murdered by this man.  Heartbroken, and emotionally shattered, Malloy subsequently falls prey to alcoholism, and is sent to a remotely located detox for cops.  Believing his fiancee's killer to have committed suicide, Malloy discovers later that the serial killer is still alive, dispatching one cop after another at this isolated retreat.

If you are amoungst those who believe that Stallone can't act, watch this film, along with ""Copland"", and the original ""First Blood"", to be persuaded otherwise.  Stallone takes a very humble approach to this role, playing this character in an understated fashion.  His take on Malloy is that the pain of having his fiancee viciously murdered has left Malloy in a constant state of emotional disarray and vulnerability; it's in this state that he must confront his fiancee's killer.

Stallone shows us Malloy as someone who has been nearly destroyed as a result of his inner pain and turmoil, but he's also a man who is, by nature, a person of great emotional control.  Stallone evolves his character as the film progresses; the more Malloy discovers how the serial killer is continuing to menace him, the greater control Malloy seems to be able to maintain over his emotions.  It's as though discovering that his nemesis is still alive has given Malloy the focus he needs to reclaim his soundness of mind.

Granted, one could call this film predictable, but it doesn't subtract from one's enjoyment of the film.  If you're a Stallone fan, and you like his more serious work, you'll love this.  My one complaint is that, at barely over one and a half hours in length, there seemed room for some additional character development for Malloy.  However, ""always leave 'em wantin' more"" is the key to success in movie-making, and it's certainly true here.  Stallone made me sympathetic with the inner turmoil Malloy experienced, and I found Malloy's regaining of his focus and resolve to be quite believeable.  There's definately a progression that Malloy goes through.  Stallone handles his character's emotional journey with dignity, showing Malloy's raw emotions up front, but also allowing us to glimpse his character's identity as a law enforcement officer and as a man.

I strongly recommend this film, both to Stallone fans, and also to fans of character-driven suspense films.  Although this is not a complicated film, it is a tale well told, and a performance well-acted, both by Stallone, and also by the supporting cast.

Sadly, the Italian Stallion's latest film venture, titled in America as ""Eye See You,"" isn't exactly all the trailers make it out to be.

I was trying to describe the plot to a friend of mine, then I gave up and said, ""It's just a slasher flick."" When you get right down to it, that's all the movie is.

I enjoyed the entire cast. Charles Dutton as Stallone's supportive friend -- I always like him. Kris Kristofferson as the head guy at the detox place -- yeah, he was good too. I'm a big fan of Tom Berenger and Robert Patrick, so I especially liked seeing them in this movie. Patrick's performance was excellent, playing a fellow ""patient"" at the detox center who is a rather callous macho jerk. He had a funny haircut, which somehow enhanced his peculiar character. Berenger, (appearing a little more slim than I've seen him looking in other recent films) was amusing as the down-to-earth caretaker who always seemed to be wearing of those furry caps with ear flaps, or a baseball cap. I started to think of his character as the ""ear flap hat guy"". Robert Prosky had a small part, but he did a good job playing another ""patient"" -- an aging cop with many skeletons in the closet. I must say, I was impressed with the quality of the actors they got for this movie.
The production values on the DVD are fine as well. There are a few extra goodies on the DVD -- ""deleted scenes"" being one (I always like deleted scenes).

(Possible Spoilers)
Stallone is a Federal Agent tracking a cop killer.  Naturally the killer goes after Stallone's girlfriend and Stallone goes off the deep end.  Finally his partner convinces him to enter a detox center for police officers.  Unfortunately it seems the killer has tracked him there.
The movie could have been good.  Stallone has the hangdog character down perfect at this point in his career and there are some very good supporting actors backing him up.  My biggest problem involved the usage of the villain.  The movie kind of dropped us right in the middle of the opening case and didn't explain any motivation on the background of the killer.  There was no proper antagonist really thrown into this movie and the character seemed more a throw away than anything else.  It's a shame really because there were some tense moments but with nothing to really play against, the movie ultimately fell flat.",1043539200,3,1083,4.939226519337017
1803541,2,B00007AJE3,"Things are complicated.  Sly's 'latest' film ""D-Tox"" is actually shot in 1999, and has long been on the shelf.  It is more confusing, because it is sometimes referred to as ""Eye See You"" while in UK, Japan, and many other countries, it is released theatrically as ""D-Tox.""  Why this confusion, as if reflecting the lack of confidence of moviemakers?
The fact is, the film is very awful.  Let me say hurriedly that I found Sly's acting is not so bad.  There are interesting supportsing cast including Tom Berenger, Polly Walker, Robert Patricl, Kris Kristopherson, and Charles S Dutton.  But the result is simply bad.
The story opens with mildly interesting premise, and it is about a detective Jake (Stallone), chasing the serial killer (who has killed 9 cops already), but cannot still have a clue.  The killer is always one step ahead of him, and Jake finds that the next victim is someone who is very close to him.  Unable to recover from the shock, he gets drunk until he is sent to an institute for rehabilitaion built in isolated mountaions in Wyoming.  Yes, for D-Tox.  But the killer somehow stalks Jake there, the patients dead one by one, and to make matters worse, the connection between the place and the outside world is shut down by the heavy snow.  Now, Jake is trapped, seeking the criminal among the immates.
OK.  The story is most incredible, but the fatal mistake is that there is no suspence in the course of the film.  First of all, you cannot just tell character A from B, so there's no point of searching for the culprit.  Moreover, those characters, trapped in the lonely place, should have been more frightened by the situation, but the reality is they are not.  And I don't know what to do when I see in the opening credit that this ""killer"" calls 911, make a statement (with title sequence a la ""Se7en"", and conludes with the comment ""Thank you for you time.""  Seriouly.  The things go automatically, and when you finally come to know the truth, you are certainly underwhelmed, losing any interest in the story.
The acting is overall bland or hammy, and even Polly Walker seems sleepwalking (why is she here?).  The only saving grace is Dean Semler's photography that captures the terrifying effect of blizzard.",1043366400,,2238,4.709511568123394
1803542,3,B00007AJE3,"You can read about the actual plot of the movie in a thousand different places, so I won't bother, but for anyone disappointed by Sylvester Stallone's last two efforts (Driven, Get Carter), this is a step in the right direction for my favorite movie star. But forget about the corny one-liners and impossible physical feats that we may have seen 10-15 years ago from Sly. While this movie has action, it's definitely a thriller movie that could even pass as horror. Many scenes are gruesome and violent. This is a good, solid movie that blows away his past two releases, yet is nothing like anything he has ever done. If you're a Stallone fan, you're going to like this movie. And even if you're not, it's still enjoyable for anyone who likes a good thriller.",1043280000,,759,4.62962962962963
1803543,5,B00007AJE3,"Very entertaining movie. Lots of breathtaking action, sustained by an interesting plot. Don't expect to find too much in-depth psychology or to hear lots of subtle assertions; the actors are excellent and only say what is needed for the spectator to fully and deeply enjoy the show. I never got tired of it !!
The part I liked less is probably the beginning. But as soon as Jake enters the remote asylum, the story takes another turn and the plot develops. The end is absolutely great: first, because, before you reach it, you cannot guess wat it will be like; second, because the action is excellent and nasty Slater gets precisely what he deserves. On top of al that, there are some nice pictures of snowy hiiltops.
It is definitely a good movie to watch if you need to relax, unwind or change your mind.",1043280000,,806,4.56551724137931
1803544,3,B00007AJE3,"I remember first hearing about the premise for D-Tox, and I thought to myself, that's a movie I'd want to check out.  That was three years ago.  Now that the movie's on DVD, I finally got the chance to see this much delayed (and much maligned) film.  My opinion?  Neither particularly good nor bad.  It's a mostly middling picture, but it's certainly better than Stallone's last few theatrical releases (Driven, Get Carter).
The plot, as it goes, stars Stallone as Jake Malloy, an FBI agent who's chasing after a cop serial killer.  But Malloy's life spirals into a downward spin when his fiancee is brutally murdered by the killer.  Heavily depressed, he finally enters a D-Tox center for cops situated in the mountains of Wyoming, just as a blizzard hits.  As it turns out, one of the rehab patients isn't who he says he is, and the patients and staff are getting knocked off one-by-one.  As the body count rises, Malloy suspects the one responsible is the same man who killed his fiancee.
D-Tox has an undeniably fun premise, and the first twenty minutes are fast-paced and compelling.  The killer's method of dispatching his victimes is morbidly amusing; he drills their eye out through the peephole of the front door, and we get to witness this not once, but twice.  Not so amusing is his calling card to Malloy, the phrase ""I see you.""  After the opening murders, we even get a tense foot chase and some gunplay, which had me suspecting I'd be in for a riveting thriller.
Not so, once the movie hits the D-Tox center, things go downhill, oddly enough.  The center itself is a visually striking set, even if having such a depressing-looking rehab center in the middle of nowhere doesn't make much sense.  Security here is virtually non-existent, which I suppose is understandable, given that the place is just starting up, but still doesn't seem very wise.  Anyway, it's still a great setting for a potential slasher.
But the movie fails to build up maximum suspense.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few mildly heart-poudning moments here and there, but the possibilities of grade-A paranoia are largely unfulfilled.  The killer could almost be anyone (though the beginning rules out the possibily of the killer being a woman are non-white male), but there are hardly enough moments where director Jim Gillespie lets the characters fears and suspicions confront one another.
Equally lackluster is the whodunnit aspect.  The identity of the killer is revealed rather early and, to be honest, I can't even remember what his motive was.  Not helping matters is the fact that few of the characters are even developed at all.  Aside from Stallone's and Polly Walker's characters, I can't remember anyone else's name.  To be fair, though, the cast is largely decent in their roles (and with good actors like Charles S. Dutton and Robert Patrick, I wouldn't expect anything less than decent).  Hell, I'd go so far as to say that even Stallone is good here (in all fairness, though, there are worse actors than him around), and his chemistry with Walker is fairly palpable and believable.
The pacing and suspense does pick up a bit in the last half-hour, which delivers just enough tension and excitement (loved the final fight between Malloy and the killer) to make this a so-so viewing for anyone the slightest bit interested.  If there's one bit of consistency here, it'd have to be the excellent cinematography, which captures the bleak essence and isolation of a blinding snowstorm.

1803545,5,B00007AJE3,"I saw the movie and I have to be honest, I was amazed by it. I mean, this movie wasn't released in theaters in North America so my expectations weren't high, but I was really happy that I saw it. Sly is great as usual, all the other actors are doing a fantastic job on this picture. The story is very good, even though there's a lot of violence at the beginning and at the very end, but it fits with the kind of movie and with the situation the caracters are in. Of course if you don't like that kind of movie don't bother seeing it but if you're a fan of Stallone or you like suspense pictures, this one's for you. It's not a classic but it's a movie that'll entertain you for 95 minutes. I really enjoyed it.",1042329600,2,710,4.042553191489362

7974511,4,B00007AJE3,"This film was originally called Detox.  Then they called it The Outpost, and finally they gave it the titleEye See You.  It was shot and finished in 1999.  Heavily reedited, reshot, and then left to gather dust on someones shelf.  Years after the fact, they decided to whisk it through a couple of theaters, then released it on DVD.

The plot involves a serial cop-killer who believes in Natural Selection.  He wants to return humanity to a state of 'dog eat dog' but realizes that cant happen if police are around to preserve order.  That, and the fact the police ruined his first foray into serial killing.  Basically, hes out for revenge and fixates on FBI agent Jake Malloy (Sylvester Stallone).  He pursues the agent to an isolated detox center out in the middle of nowhere.  The detox center is filled with cops who are addicts of one kind or another.  At this point the plot utilizes a standard slasher flick formulatrap a group in an isolated place then pick them off one at a time.  Practically everyone is a red herring.

I liked this film precisely because it is (more or less) a standard slasher flick.  Im not a fan of Stallone but I thought he did a credible job of holding this picture together.
It stays in my collection for future viewings.",1504569600,,1257,4.553571428571429
