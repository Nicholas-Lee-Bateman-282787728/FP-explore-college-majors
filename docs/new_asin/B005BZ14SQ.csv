8464673,4,B005BZ14SQ,"As a fan of China documentaries and ones about US manufacturing this DVD provides insights into both topics.  The director poses the question of whether Chinese manufactured items are good for America.  He shows the consumers being wowed by cheap electronics, but the flip side is that some US manufacturing sectors are struggling.
While the director looks at textiles in some detail, as an easy to discuss and visually appealing theme, he could go much further.  US manufacturing of advanced energy systems would tackle two parts of the trade deficit at once:  a.  imports from China, and b. oil imports.  Advanced energy systems (solar, nuclear, and more) would become a valuable export to China and reduce that deficit and simultaneously reduce oil imports.  Just one catch:  long term government funding of R&D is needed, a sort of 21st century Apollo project or Manhattan project.",1400544000,,885,5.097222222222222

8464675,3,B005BZ14SQ,"After watching it twice looking for a deeper meaning, as far as I can tell, here is what this video will try to convince you of 3 things:
1. The Chinese have a harder and more ruthless work ethic than Americans do.
2. They also don't view inventive ideas as the property of the inventor, so copying does not have the negative stigma it has here.
3. Economic condition are so bad in China that workers are willing to work and live so cheaply that we should feel guilty about buying Chinese goods.
They do not deal much with the issue that if we didn't buy cheap Chinese goods those same workers would be in much worse shape.
Even though the DVD presentation was really not bad, if you already believe all of the above, you would not get too much out of this video other than a little human interest and scenery.",1380672000,,810,4.300653594771242
8464676,5,B005BZ14SQ,"I honestly recommend this highly.  One of its themes - that Americans in general have no clue about China and form opinions based on an appalling level of ignorance - comes thru gently, but clearly.  The film maker did a great job of just interviewing people in multiple roles and making the viewer think, without rendering judgment on anything.  You need a lot more than this to form any valid opinions about anything China related, but this is as good a place to start as any.",1363132800,,478,4.534883720930233
8464677,3,B005BZ14SQ,"In one way,  this video is made in China; and it's a documentary about not buying stuff made in China. Haha.
Seriously, there is nothing new here.  Don't waste your time and money.  It's a bit contrived.  Obviously the economic upswing of China has been unstoppable for years.  And at times this video is almost like a commercial that
sets its sights on making one feel almost benign about it.  The Chinese, who are so paranoid about what is said or shown about them, seem to have no qualms about what some of their people say in this video.  Are this kids still alive or free over there after what they said on film??  Was not the footage reviewed by Chinese authorities before it left their country? If so, and accepted by them, then there appears to be no real problem.  Although I have no issue with anyone on this planet making a better life for themselves,  it seems a bit contrived that one would make a documentary about the situation, but offer no anwers; but show a seemingly happy and healthy (staged?) Chinese population. The country side is verdent, the streets in the city are clean, the factories visited are spotless (again, staged?).  The documentary creator and his GF visit a large play in upper China. They are the only people in the seats, yet a full musical production is put on  for....whose benefit?  A commercial for China to the west?
Don't waste your time or money with this one.  IF you must, then review the outakes and interviews that were cut from the main documentary. They shed much more light than the film itself did. Otherwise, I feel the Chinese allowed this to happen only because they manipulated it.",1333756800,,1639,4.587628865979381
8464678,4,B005BZ14SQ,"This 90-minute film visits a few Chinese manufacturers and interviews several Americans and Chinese to obtain a diverse collection of insightful opinions on the current economic cold war between the US and China.  It veers off course a bit and spends more time than necessary, in my opinion, to discuss China's human rights issues, but the information presented is fascinating nonetheless.  The film first aired on CNBC in June this year and is one of the better and more in-depth documentaries on the subject.

The film has been released on DVD and Blu-ray by Earthchild Production.  The Blu-ray, which I bought, is a burned disc in BD-R format. Not all players can play BD-R discs, so check your manual.  The 1080p picture is fine, as is the stereo soundtrack.  Other than on-screen, unremovable English subtitles for the Mandarin comments, there are no other subtitle options.  Bonus features include about an hour of interview segments not included in the film.",1318032000,6,965,5.031446540880503
