8361126,3,B002BEXFL4,"The first TV Lois Lane - not long after she left the series - is found in this Commodore film, one in a long film series with Clyde Beatty.

Rather episodic: she has a nice role (over too soon) as a big game hunter who delivers wild animals to various venues. Having taken over her business from her Father, she struggles - a big part of her tribulation is competitor, Gruman (played well by John Wayne supporting actor, John Doucette). He' s not nice to humans *or* animals. Beatty saves his life...and *he's* he's out of the picture...then CB manages to capture a large gorilla, which will help Coates and her enterprise. some scenes depict practices which today would not happen with professional hunters. It's 1953, and all the ""dark continent"" clich&eacute;s abound.

(Bizarre scenes involving the burning of Coates' cages: Clyde's assistant, Grant (played poorly by Stanley Farrar) drops his cigarette lighter; a safari staffer, picks it up and accidentally misuses it and the place goes up. He never says, where's my lighter? oh no, maybe...? half-spoiler, sorry).

Nice touch involves the rescue of two ""native"" woman from a violent ritual (encountered by the troup as they fin d their way to a Hospital to treat Grant, who has been bitten by the ""tse-tse"" fly). The ""Boy King"" (Shelby Bacon), actually put in the position of Judge and Jury, is also rescued, in a sense: he makes his decision but he is [temporarily] kidnapped by Clyde and co., used as a human shield for the big getaway, then returned, unharmed. Bacon gets a big close-up, expressing amazement at the courage of the (initially) hostile appearing group.

Interesting how legitimate hunter-explorers today do all they can to subdue an animal, to study, and return. This might be of value to children today to show the contrast and how far we have, in this discipline.

Excellent script gets elemental directorial treatment.",1387324800,,1897,4.915625
