4043774,5,B0030CLTLY,"Well...SAVE a lot of space and money. The
18 DVDs----here----are the ones to buy. I'm
baffled at the $1.60 a (today anyway) disc
price...
I have seen this more expensive, elsewhere,
and for as high as $75, u-s-e-d !

Buy it!
If I didn't already HAVE all of the Charlie Chan
flicks available, I wouldn't THINK about it... I'd
JUMP on this deal!",1413158400,14,343,4.444444444444445

4043776,4,B0030CLTLY,"This boxed set is in flimsier cardboard than the original sets. The discs have different art than the original, so there are no double sided discs (hence the deletion of Beyond that Curtain - remade later by Toler in a much better version called  Murder over New York).  As stated by another reviewer there are eighteen discs of the twenty three movies known to be in existence, not counting the Monogram series. But having watched six of the ones in this set, these 18 discs seem to be the same as the ones in the original much pricier sets with the same special features, same menus and same quality (or lack thereof). The cardboard cases have slits to slip the discs into, so that this total set is about an inch in width and this is the selling point for me. In my copy of this boxed set unlike another reviewer I have copies of MURDER CRUISE and RENO. The five that are not in my set are: (Charlie Chan in)PANAMA,RIO,THE WAX MUSEUM, DEAD MEN TELL, and CASTLE IN THE DESERT which are all great Toler movies and all in Volume 5 of the original release. But I can save about a foot of  space, even if I keep Volume 5  which I already have. So for a collector running out of space for my 30's mysteries, this set is a great deal.",1403568000,32,1230,4.266094420600858
4043777,4,B0030CLTLY,"20th Century Fox has done a great job at releasing the excellent Charlie Chan series of films in boxed sets.  This particular collection combines 18 of the previous films into a nifty compact collection.  Anyone who likes older films and classic mysteries would do themselves a favor by picking this set up.

There are some good and bad points about this set.

THE GOOD:  This set not only has the films from the boxed sets, but carries over most of the extras as well.  The 18 single-sided discs are conveniently arranged in three fold-out ""albums"" and everything is brightly labeled.  The films are completely restored and have never looked better.

THE BAD:  This set does not have every film from the boxed sets, so this is not a complete substitute. The disc with MONTE CARLO says to ""Flip it over for BEHIND THAT CURTAIN (1929, an early Chan film).""  However, there is no ""other side.""  Also, the last film in this collection is partway through the what the fifth boxed set contains at MURDER OVER NEW YORK, omitting DEAD MEN TELL, IN RENO, IN PANAMA, MURDER CRUISE and CASTLE IN THE DESERT.

So if you want to continue buying the complete series you'll have some overlap with the fifth boxed set.  Unless another volume like this one is put out, but no word on that.

All in all this is a great set for what it is.  Completists might want to judge if this is way to go for them.",1271894400,48,1385,4.484

8385730,4,B0030CLTLY,"This is a good set and you get all the films that were included in the 4 much larger box sets plus 2 films from the 5th set. But if you plan to buy this as a replacement for the larger box sets you should hold on to one disc. ""Charlie Chan in Monte Carlo"". The reason being that in the original set this was a double sided disc with the B side containing the 1929 film ""Behind The Curtain"" which was the first sound film to have the Charlie Chan character in it. In this set that disc is single sided and does not include this film. Although the menu will say it is on the B side. Other than that all the special features from the original sets are included.",1512518400,,658,3.992424242424242

8385734,4,B0030CLTLY,Great addition to our classic movie collection - love Charlie Chan.,1470787200,,67,5.181818181818182
8385735,5,B0030CLTLY,"Great collection with fun extras.  Charlie Chan is so kind and funny and has a wonderful relationship with his family.  He's such a great character.  Warner Oland and Sidney Toler bring something special and unique to their portrayals, and I love both of them.  The racist moments are really jarring to me, but aside from that, these movies are really great.

The discs were actually dirty on the back, so I was very worried they wouldn't play.  (I tried to gently clean them, but I couldn't.)  But I've played three random discs fully so far, and they all play perfectly.  And this set was such a great value.  18 movies!  And such a small footprint, too.  I am so glad I got this collection.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.",1463184000,10,741,4.53030303030303
