Now, I'll be able to watch anytime I want to in comfort.  This 1-hour version of the ""Dam Busters"" documentary is far better, in my view, than the 2-hour version that came out a few years later.  The 1-hour version has everything a person would need to understand why the mission was necessary, the amazing engineering by British scientist Barnes Wallace, and why so many young airmen from the RAF risked their lives in an effort to destroy 5 dams in the German Ruhr valley.  Of the 19 aircraft sent out to bomb the dams in May, 1943, 8 were lost including their crew of 53 men.  But 2 of the dams were badly damaged and took months to repair; moreover, over 1,000 German lives were lost, mainly due to drowning.  The Germans had to re-deploy defense forces from the Eastern Front to prevent the British from trying again and this helped the Allies immensely in placing Germany in a vice from both east and west.  Anyone interested in World War II who has not seen this video should try to get a copy.  It is simply superb, with narration by Liev Schreiber.  --Jim Wheeler, Tucson, Arizona",1524441600,,1237,4.457777777777777
7981292,4,B00008BG2B,"As a WWII history buff and a fan of the ""DAMBUSTERS"" Movie starring M.Redgrave, for many years.  I was Very Happy to see that someone had made an actual (Up-to-Date) Documentary on this subject.  This Video answers many questions the ""Movie"" didn't go into (Understanding, that at the time the Movie was shot, many of the details and tactics used would have been still Classified).  I was very interested in the first-hand accounts form a number the crewmen and ground crew that took part in the raid.  The live action and 3D graphic re-creations were very well done.  The only reason I gave this a 4 Star Rating, was that this documentary was only 1 hour long.  There is so much more to this story that could have been added to make this an easy 90 minute to 2 hour long Documentary, but most important... Where's the DVD?

P.S.  There's a reason why the ""DAMBUSTER"" Movie is hardly ever shown in the U.S.A. anymore, if ever on TV.

Take a guess.

Thanks to the Small of Mind and Weak of Heart.  A piece of History (...far more important than is realized).  was REMOVED from reality and dropped into the P.C. (Politically Correct) Black Hole.  Hopefully one day,  we'll all grow-up and put away our childish things.

I'm sorry for the Rant... I'm just not a Book-Burner at heart.",1122595200,,1280,4.552631578947368
