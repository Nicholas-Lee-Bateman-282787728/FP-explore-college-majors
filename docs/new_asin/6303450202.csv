649927,5,6303450202,"I'm a mom of two and my mother bought us this movie when my 1st son was born he was about one he loved it.  I've never seen anything keep his attention that long.  When my 2nd son was born my three year old was watching it and at 5 months my other son sat in the middle of the floor enraptured with this movie, he will sit throught the whole thing even after three months of watching it.  We've bought many of the wee sing videos in the past three years and I'd say this is the best one and it's not even bad for the parents.",977961600,7,525,3.8425925925925926

The storyline is bound to capture the imagination of children and the  songs (many of which will be familiar to you), dances and acting are all  superb. If you have never seen a Wee Sing video, this is the one to start  off with. (I personally do not like their other videos or music CDs - this  video is an exception).",968371200,15,395,4.090909090909091

651625,5,6303450202,"Very fun Children's DVD with lots of songs from year's past (many I recall from my own childhood).  It is a joy to listen to and watch for any age children.  And parents, you'll probably be singing along with many of the songs.  It is simple, yet creative.  Reminds me a little of the old show ""Patches & Pockets"" where the toys come to life (but not quite so silly).  My 3 1/2 year old just loves it and it captures the attention of my 9 month old.  She watches intensely & bounces (her version of dancing) to the songs.",1195257600,,521,4.16

651627,5,6303450202,"My children wore out our VHS copy in the late 80's.  Every niece and nephew was given a copy and it played non-stop for every family ""reunion"" vacation we had for 8 straight years.  Everyone(their parents, older siblings and the kids) love the music, the story and the characters.  I was so happy to see that I could buy it for my 1st grandbaby!  Well it's official, he loves it too, and my daughters were so excited to sit and watch it again, and again.  It contiues to be a happy memory for our family. In this season of my life I am blessed to have ""extra"" funds, so now I can afford to get Sillyville, too!  I can't wait to see it with my grandbaby!",1189814400,,653,4.142857142857143

651630,5,6303450202,"We got this tape for our first when she was 3 years old, some years ago. I think she (and her parents) watched it a couple of hundred times! This year, our younger one, also 3, has taken to it, just as her big sister once did (and she too is enjoying watching it all over again).

From an adult point of view, it is a bit hokey  at first(I had a hard time keeping a straight face listening to the ""Dutch"" Girl). But it captivates you over time, and we came to realize that this is a real class-act of a children's video; very much an overlooked classic.  Absolutely the best, a must for every DVD shelf.",1171152000,,603,4.093220338983051

651632,5,6303450202,My daughter is 4 years old and she enjoys watching this dvd. I have to admit I also enjoyed watching it with her.  My daughter began to sing the songs to an adult friend of ours and our friend was amazed that my daughter knew the same songs we grew up with.  It's a great DVD and it teaches our children songs that are so innocent in nature. I love it.  OOOPS! I mean my daughter loves it.,1168300800,2,389,3.9615384615384617

It was fun watching the toys come to life and seeing them dance and sing a lot of old favorite songs. It's now being enjoyed by my family again - more than 10 years later! My 3 year old and 20 month old thoroughly enjoy watching, dancing, and singing along with Punchinello, sailor, muffin man, and all of their toy friends.

This would be a fun addition to your video library.",1128297600,2,481,4.285714285714286
651707,3,6303450202,"We had gotten some very used VHS tapes (Wee Sing Rock Candy Mountain, WeeSing Kingdom & Wee Sing Train) from a family member whose children loved Wee Sing as little children. We soon discovered our little too adored them so we decided to add to our collection. Aftr reading several reviews for Wee Sing - Grandpa's Magical Toys it seemed like a good choice. However, I am disappointed in this one. It just doesn't have the same ""something"" that the others do. The songs aren't as catchy & original and the charcters are mostly people as opposed to ""puppety"" charcters (like Tusky or The SnoodleDoodles from the other videos). It's a cute video but it's not a favorite.",1127088000,7,668,4.669491525423729
651708,5,6303450202,"We stumbled on the Wee Sing videos when my twins were about 18 months old. Grandpa came along at 2. I guess I have to owe part of my sanity to him and Peter. He and Barney came out about the same time and the plush doll came to visit the house, but the TV screen never showed it. GRANDPA GRANDPA was all I ever heard and I was only too happy to show it. My boys and I would sit around and sing the songs I'd grown up with. No ""children-only"" themes. No swords, lasers, guns, punching, kicking, etc. Good, old-fashioned song and dance. A little hokey, but in a good way. I've bought this in video form for every person I know having a child. My cousin has had her second baby and I'm now getting the DVD for her 3-year old. Can't think of anything better.",1123891200,4,754,4.067114093959732

The songs are catchy, the plot is enjoyable- and well, I have a lot of sentimental attachment to it, I'm willing to admit, but I just feel that this movie (and some of the other sillyville movies, too) is a lot BETTER than the stuff they put out for kids today. I also have to confess that I haven't seen it on DVD as of yet, but even if the quality is no better than it was on VHS, I still plan to order it right away simply because the DVD will last longer! Great film. Get it for your kids, cousins, whoever you have an excuse to buy it for!",1118793600,,632,3.984251968503937

I am trying to purchase it for my granddaughter but unfortunately it has been discontinued and where available is very high in price.  It is a great video to have but for the price now offered it is ludicrous.  I hope in the future it will come back and for the price originally sold for.,1040947200,8,565,4.137614678899083
