1961715,5,B0000Z0I8E,"I was introduced to this Sitcom while visiting my daughter in Hawaii this summer.  Even though it was several seasons into the series, I was able to relate to the story line and characters...made me laugh like I haven't in several months.  I will be purchasing the entire series!",1188345600,2,279,4.673469387755102
1961716,5,B0000Z0I8E,"This is a funny, well-paced show that American audiences can relate to.  It's your typical family!",1186531200,2,98,5.125
1961717,5,B0000Z0I8E,"MY FAMILY series one review

Ben Harper (Robert Lindsay; Jericho, Hornblower) is a dentist who has to suffer his children, with the aid and hinderance of his wife Susan (Zo Wanamaker; Harry Potter). The eldest, Nick (Kris Marshall; Murder City, Love Actually) is a 20-year-old layabout constantly trying various get-rich-quick schemes rather than get a real job. Middle-child Janey (Daniela Denby-Ashe) tries to rebel while milking her parents for money and stuff. The youngest and brainiest, Michael (Gabriel Thomson) keeps mostly out of the spotlight as he takes potshots at everyone.

Series one is an excellent comedy about a modern dysfunctional (though fictional) family, sporting witty scripting, fun situations and stunts, and great casting.

There are eight episodes:

The Serpent's Tooth - Susan and Janey sees another dentist.

Pain In the Class - Michael is being bullied.

Droit de Seigneur Ben - Ben's assistant arranges a date for Janey.

The Last Resort - Ben and Susan go on a sort of second honeymoon.

Farewell To Alarms - A rash of robberies inspire Susan to get an alarm.

Death Takes A Policy - Nick's new girlfriend is an insurance saleswoman.

The Awkward Phase - Michael's first date.

Much Ado About Ben - Ben has a mild heart attack, prompting him to change his life.

I have only seen the first three series, and they get progressively worse. This, however, is well worth the purchase, as it is very entertaining throughout.",1180396800,6,1452,5.02928870292887
1961718,5,B0000Z0I8E,"This series is just perfect.  The writing is sharp and witty, and the characters extremely likable.  This is a series that is hard to stop watching.  I went through all the episodes in just two sittings!!  I can't wait for the next season to arrive.",1179014400,11,249,4.466666666666667
1961719,5,B0000Z0I8E,"This show is the funniest thing to appear on the BBC since Tony Blair. Ben Harper is a wonderfully sarcastic character, no doubt influenced by John Cleese's Basil Fawlty (as hinted at by several in-jokes). If you are a fan of Fawlty Towers, and/or Brit humour, this is the show for you. Imagine Basil with a family, and a wife who gives as good as she gets, and you get the picture.

This will keep you laughing for years, and provide dozens of wonderful one-liners to annoy your friends with.",1171238400,2,493,4.477777777777778
1961720,5,B0000Z0I8E,"Family television at its best!  I highly recommend this most entertaining series to anyone who likes good television and wants to laugh with every episode.  Writers and actors of this caliber are hard to find and when we do, we must encourage them to keep going.  The cast is so wonderful and  believable as well as funny.  I could see it over and over and find myself laughing again and again. But really, what is more important than laughter in times of stress and every day life?",1160611200,4,482,4.494252873563219
1961721,5,B0000Z0I8E,"There are a lot of Brit-com series with great humor, but I have to say ""My Family"" tops the list.  I have been buying the series over the years from the UK in PAL format and have watched it over & over.  Unlike current US sitcoms, this series has good old fashioned family humor--like it ""could happen to you"".  Some scenes are so unbelievably hilarious--you have to rewind to see what you missed through the tears of laughter.  Buy one series and you will not be able to wait for more to be produced (Six series have been released in the UK--and the quality of the comedy never dies--excellent writing and acting by all the ""My Family"" cast)",1154476800,23,642,4.415254237288136
1961722,5,B0000Z0I8E,"My Family has to be the funniest and best show ever created.  If we only had more access to the show in the United States.

Anyone interested in viewing the show before buying should tune to the BBCA channel on cable/satellite.

Please help this show work it's way to television here!",1146009600,18,284,4.529411764705882

1961734,5,B0000Z0I8E,"Our family really enjoys My Family, the TV series.  We were so disappointed when it went off the air and now we can own the series.  This is one hilarious show that has held up over time due to the fine comedic acting and chemistry of the entire cast.  Laugh-out-loud funny.",1377820800,,274,4.333333333333333
1961735,5,B0000Z0I8E,"I have to thank Maryland Public Television in the DC area for having the wisdom to broadcast this show. Otherwise, I would, sadly, have never known about it. MPTV seems to know instinctively what their east coast audience is going to like.  Now - when is WETA-UK going to get onboard and broadcast ""My Family"" as well? (their endless decades of re-runs of the stale and ancient ""Are You Being Served?"" is getting more than tiresome.)  ""My Family"" is a keeper for sure. The laughs just keep coming, and the writing and acting are first rate. I bought the DVD cuz I wanna watch the episodes over again, they're so good.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that all the seasons DVDs are available in Region 1 format.  Hope they will all be, eventually.",1375660800,,742,4.598484848484849
1961736,1,B0000Z0I8E,"MY FAMILY is one of those programs that make you despair whether television has advanced in any profitable way over the last few decades. Set in a mythical suburbia, where the house is perfectly upholstered and decorated (even though the family appears to be struggling for money), it contains the kind of sitcom stereotypes familiar for generations: the harassed husband Ben (Robert Lindsay), the streetwise housewife (Zoe Wanamaker), and three know-it-all kids (including Kris Marshall and Daniella Denby-Ashe).  The plots remain the same throughout: Dad tries to impose his views on the rest of the family but finds himself continually outwitted.  Any changes to the nuclear family - a consequence of feminism, perhaps - are conveniently overlooked.  Given the talents of the cast involved (both Lindsay and Wanamaker are accomplished actors in all media), one wonders why they wanted to become involved in this farrago. Probably for money: the series continues to be repeated on the BBC's international cable channels, which should provide the cast with plenty of residuals.",1365033600,,1078,5.366863905325443

1961738,5,B0000Z0I8E,"This series is in a vague way a type of british ""Roseanne"" a lot of wise cracking and put downs but in a non offensive way. The characters always kept it humorous. They are addictive.",1356566400,,183,4.257142857142857

1961740,5,B0000Z0I8E,"This has to be one of the funniest comedy series I have ever seen. The family members are so different, but it works. Ben reminds me of my hubby. I love this. It is a must watch. My favorite character is Nick. How stupid can one person be. He has me in stitches.",1354579200,,262,3.9622641509433962
1961741,5,B0000Z0I8E,Saw while visiting relatives and decided I need to check out a whole season.  Very funny and enjoyable. Too bad it isn't on TV anymore.,1345420800,,135,4.4
1961742,5,B0000Z0I8E,Love BBC's version of a sitcom. Excellent story lines and the actors do a good job of not laughing it up while they are doing their bit. Fantastic. My only concern is when I get to the end of season 4 what then...I'll have to hope that I can buy the UK versions from season 5 onward to season 11 so that I can continue to enjoy this vibrant comedy.,1329955200,,348,3.9857142857142858
1961753,4,B0000Z0I8E,"this show is very funny.even though season 1 is not the funniest of the series; its very funny, the favorite episode on the disk is when they decided to get an alarm system in their home, i won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it .but you will love it,",1326067200,,257,4.0588235294117645

1961756,5,B0000Z0I8E,"Best British sitcom for the first 4 years anyway.

The Harpers are the funniest family in Britain along with learning important lessons along the way. Ben and Susan have a special rapport but their oldest son Nick makes the show the funniest ever.
Enjoy!",1289174400,2,254,4.7727272727272725
1961757,5,B0000Z0I8E,This show was always so funny on BBC America.  I couldn't resist buying season one first & eventually going to buy the other ones.,1284681600,,130,4.416666666666667
1961758,5,B0000Z0I8E,"I love this series! I first got interested after seeing the Christmas special on BBC America this past year. Since then, I've watched three series of it. The fourth is the last available, and I can't wait for more to come out!",1280361600,2,226,4.404761904761905

1961761,5,B0000Z0I8E,"Nothing beats a good english series when it's well done; and this is certainly the case here. Exquisite script backed with very good actors and the end result is an excellent time in perspective.
The only bad thing about this is the presence of only 6 episodes, if only good things last a bit longer!!",1221782400,,301,4.490909090909091

8004743,5,B0000Z0I8E,"Several years ago BBC-America ran the first few seasons of ""My Family"". And every afternoon it was on, I recorded it.  It is the FUNNIEST sitcom ever!  Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker are perfect as a middle class couple, in love but always playing the game of one-upmanship. Kris Marshall steals scenes as a late-teen-early-20s do-nothing son who is always looking for a quick buck (er, pound) from his parents or from some other scheme. His plan to sell Christmas trees is our favorite episode (can't remember now which one of series 1 to 4 it is in). We watch it every Christmas.

We were able to get the first four series in Region 1 (US-Can.version), waiting patiently for 10-or-so years for the rest to come out.  I come in here periodically to check if there is any indication that these Region 1 DVDs would be available in my lifetime. So now they've got the COMPLETE set in only Region 2 (Eur.verson).  Well, that's some progress, I suppose. Does the British TV industry think we're not worth it over here?",1500076800,,1016,4.622222222222222

8004749,5,B0000Z0I8E,"This is a remarkable comedy series for all of the four seasons available, but the first season has to be one of the funniest comedy collections ever recorded.

The only thing that can compete with it for hilarious television comedy is the collection of the twelve episodes of of John Cleese's Fawlty Towers.

The writing, the acting, the casting are all, as the Brits would say, spot on. Zo Wanamaker resembles a living cartoon character, an extremely funny cartoon character. Robert Lindsay is a perfect foil for her. Kris Marshall as the oldest son has some great moments.

Some of these episodes can make you laugh until you have tears in your eyes.

This is not a charming, sweet, lovable cast like the cast of the wonderful The Good Neighbors (aka The Good Life), but it is a terribly funny cast.",1398124800,,801,4.659574468085107
