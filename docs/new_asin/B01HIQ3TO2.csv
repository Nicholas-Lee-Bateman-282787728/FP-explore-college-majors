7787546,5,B01HIQ3TO2,I Just saw this at the movie theatres this morning with my little sisters. It was a special one day event at my local theatre and it didn't disappoint. This movie is filled with heart beautiful art work and such a great story line. I don't want to spoil the film so I won't be giving to much information about the story but I absolutely loved it. It's a great family movie with such an encouraging message. Barbie never dissapoints. I'd definitely recommend it. This also has to be the most detailed Barbie movie ever.,1469836800,19,518,4.463157894736842

7787576,5,B01HIQ3TO2,"Very good message for young girls to see. I'm not a huge fan of Barbie and we don't watch the Dreamhouse series, but this one is different. Barbie uses character traits such as courage, bravery, instinct, following one's heart, respectful opposition, teamwork, being magnanimous, and owning up to one's mistakes to ""save the day."" I feel good about our young daughters watching this. No ""bad guys"" in this one, just adventure. You see Barbie grow in confidence in this one, and display humility.",1485561600,,495,4.975903614457831

7787581,4,B01HIQ3TO2,"I was hesitant to purchase this movie because again Barbie is voiced by another person instead of Kelly Sheridan, but the movie was very good. The only reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is her voice. I do like Erica better than the one girl they had previously voice Barbie in one other movie, but she's just not Kelly. The songs and scenery were great. I enjoyed the space theme and how Barbie loves all the animals. It was a real pleasure to watch.",1483920000,,449,4.232558139534884

7787599,3,B01HIQ3TO2,"I really love the way the movie looks, the outfits, backgrounds, special effects, but the story was okay. I think they tried too hard to get us to believe that Barbie was just a regular girl that we can relate to. For example. her being late, clumsy, etc. I totally understand and can definitely relate those things but I didn't have to see her knock something over each time she stepped into a room. The characters seemed like stereotypes of teenagers (always hungry & joking about food) rather than actual teenagers. I also understand that I am not the target audience (I'm 25) so with that in mind I get it. I did enjoy the plot, she's trying new things even when she is scared, following her heart, and riding a hover board! Like always, I'm excited for the next movie.",1480636800,4,773,4.48936170212766

7787609,1,B01HIQ3TO2,"My review on this is based solely on how Barbie was portrayed in this movie.  She's shown as shockingly and unhealthfully thin, to the point that in this house, we've dubbed this the movie with ""anorexic Barbie"" as the star.  I realize this is just a cartoon, but young girls watch these things.  I first realized the power these movies had over my daughter when around three years ago she said she wasn't pretty because she wasn't thin like Barbie-and our girl is a very healthy weight.  And the Barbie shown in that movie was down right voluptuous compared to the one in this movie.

It ended up becoming the start of a few years worth of building up and talking about the importance of understanding with a healthy body image looks like, and how that isn't always portrayed in movies, media, or other forms of entertainment.  So while I'm glad to be able to have had this dialogue with my daughter, if she hadn't been open with me about her feelings I never would have known that was how she was processing it.  So I've had a love/hate relationship with Barbie movies ever since.  I buy them if our daughter asks for them, but we always discuss body image concerns afterwards.

And for impressionable young girls, the body image shown for Barbie in this movie is unhealthfully thin.",1478649600,3,1285,4.576419213973799

I loved the idea that they were in space, but there wasn't enough talk about actual space for me. Call me crazy, but I like my Barbie movies to have a bit of substance to them, and this one just didn't have what we were looking for. Puppy Adventure was such a great movie, wish they would make more like that.",1477353600,5,419,4.25

7787621,4,B01HIQ3TO2,"In a galaxy far away, Barbie is enlisted to help save the star light (?). I like that there are no real bad guys or even much real rivalry among the characters. The King comes closest, being single-minded and supercilious. Sci-Fi Barbie is pretty neat with the best animation yet exhibiting good textures and lush backgrounds.

7787624,5,B01HIQ3TO2,"Animation for Barbie movies have come along way.  The way they animated Barbie's face in this movie reminds me a bit of Rapunzel from Tangle, and hmm her hair looks like someone's from Frozen...  With that said, it seems that the people behind Barbie movies are taking notes and trying out what works and I noticed that along every 15 minutes interval, the movie would have music/singing to break up the dialogue - which is great in keeping the little one's attention.  Movies that have just dialogue would loose the attention of my 6 yo pretty much about 15 minutes into it.
So animation:  Beautiful world graphic., Beautiful character animation. However when it comes to the animal, typical of most Barbie movies, there is just something off.  The pet in this movie is tolerable but still can use improvement.
Story: The focus is mostly about the adventure of going to far off places, meeting new challenges, and meeting new people (and in Barbie movies, they will become good friends).  The conclusion was rather non-eventful but typical of most Barbie movie, there is always that morphing of clothing to that glam outfit at the end...with added sparkles.  It's quite spectacular.  Actually in this movie, Barbie did this morphing dress move twice.
Music: I actually find the music very well done.  It's catchy and upbeat.  Every time the movie breaks into music, my little girl would dance to it.
So in conclusion, it was a very enjoyable movie.  We actually rented the movie first, but my little girl keep wanting to watch it again and again that I've decided to buy a copy to add to our collection.  5 stars",1476576000,2,1613,4.762589928057554

7787642,5,B01HIQ3TO2,"I have all the Barbie movies, but my new favorite one has to be ""Barbie: Star Light Adventure"".

I really enjoyed this one, because we see a much younger Barbie-barely a teenager.

She's very much a free spirit-impetuous, not always thinking before she acts or speaks, but kind hearted, as well as telekinetic, and able to communicate with animals through music. She lives on a forested world called Para-Den, with her widowed father, and rides a hoverboard, which allows her to travel all over her world.

She, along with four other talented teens, are called upon to restore a universe where the stars are going out.

Her fellow teens from other worlds include:

Leo: an expert pilot, who's also a prince.
Sal-Lee: A world-class hoverborder, where Barbie is only a regional champ.
Sheena & Kareena: telepathic twins, who often speak & think as one.  One has the power to negate gravity, & the other can increase gravity.

They are assembled to help a King named Constantine-a pompous, overly-confident ruler, who is used to having things HIS way, or else.  He is convinced that HE is the one who can save the galaxy.

Barbie has a few run-ins with the King, including being late to a royal ball, being late to a training session with the others, and not controlling her pet Pupcorn, a furball who ""pops"", and turns into a cat.

Despite their differences, they are able to work as a team, and come to realize that Barbie is the true leader, and conscience of the team.

Because this movie is unlike any of the other worlds of the previous Barbie movies, the writers have a lot more leeway, on creating alien sets, characters, and worlds.  It is a nice break from the previous ""earthbound"" Barbie movies.

It is thoroughly enjoyable.",1474761600,,1733,4.717607973421927
7787643,4,B01HIQ3TO2,By far one of the best Barbie movies yet. The movie was funny and the animation was great the first thing I noticed was how amazing there teeth were and there eyes were so pretty. The colors and animals were so vivid.,1474761600,,217,4.190476190476191

7787646,5,B01HIQ3TO2,"My daughter loves the Barbie movies and this one was a hit! It is fun that it is on other planets with cool space creatures. Love that there is no girl drama or need for Barbie to find a prince to make everything all better. The main song is permanently stuck in my daughter's head now, good thing it is cute- lol. It is fun and entertaining and a great family movie.",1474416000,2,367,4.111111111111111

7787648,5,B01HIQ3TO2,From Naiya (age 5): I liked it because it was Barbie & it was really cool.,1474243200,,74,3.6875
7787649,5,B01HIQ3TO2,"We watch a lot of Barbie movies in my house, so when a new one comes out, Im just as excited as my daughter- since it something new!! This is a very cute movie. As with other Barbie movies, its great in showing girls doing something strong and powerful. Barbie uses her brains, gifts and athletic ability, showing a well-rounded girl. Its not a love story which I like, while there is a slight love interest- its very subtle, older girls would pick up on it more. Pupcorn is adorable, and of course means another Barbie pet will be making its way onto my house as well.  I loved the scenery and the unique animals from the planet that Barbie lived on.",1474243200,5,651,4.336065573770492

7787658,5,B01HIQ3TO2,"I started watching the Barbie movies when I bought Princess & the Pop star for my 2 year old in 2014. The music in the movies is great!
