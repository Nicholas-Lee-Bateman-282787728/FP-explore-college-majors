8265509,3,B0017APPWU,"For those trivia fans, this was the third Sacrifice that involved a tournament (the first two involved the World & Super X Cup) but this one was based around the tag team tournament to crown new Tag Team Champions...however, TNA decided to use a format in having four ""established teams"" face off against 4 teams picked at random (a throwback to WCW's old ""Lethal Lottery"" concept) with one of the random wrestlers being the Womens Champion in Awesome Kong.  On top of this, Kurt Angle suffered an injury which caused him to be removed from the World Title match earlier in the show.

Team 3D vs. Sting & James Storm - This was more of a ""put a storyline over"" segment than an actual match as it was all about Sting & Storm not getting along to the point where Storm just went to the floor while Sting fought off both members of Team 3D before they finally stepped aside & let Sting slam Storm through the table setup in the ring (funny moment).  Again, this was to continue the Sting/Storm storyline more than anything...and a complete waste of a Sting appearence.

Christian Cage & Rhino vs. Robert Roode & Booker T - Just like the previous match, two recent enemies were teaming with each other here & they were getting into it before Rhino & Cage even came out to ringside.  Unlike the previous match, this was an actual match that went back & forth between both teams with Booker & Roode making the blind tags with each other throughout the match that would eventually lead to their downfall.  Decent match for what it was with an aftermath that's been building up for the past month now...and hopefully on the DVD, they'll switch the camera angles so everyone watching TV doesn't see what's going to happen for around around 20 secs. before Mike & Don notice it to sell the shock value.

Kip James & Matt Morgan vs L.A.X. - Third time in a row, two enemies teaming together as Morgan & Kip were no strangers to each other in the past weeks as well but unlike the previous two teams, they were actually trying to work together.  While Morgan did showcase some ""Undertaker"" like ability, the match was too short (less than 5 mins.) to really get into.

A.J. Styles & Super Eric vs B.G. James & Awesome Kong - This match didn't make alot of sense story wise as it was Eric Young/Super Eric who cost A.J. the tag titles in the first place but now they're acting like buddies to the point where A.J. was referred to as Eric's ""super hero buddy.""  Besides that point, this match was all about the ""Chyna"" factor in Awesome Kong as A.J. was resisting fighting her at first until she wouldn't let up from attacking.  From there, Kong didn't do much but what was done was impactful & played a factor in the end result in her team's downfall as Super Eric slammed her (that's right the comedy act overpowered the dominate monster) onto B.G.  One moment to look out for was the ending when Styles went for a springboard but slipped and crashed face first.  Just like the previous matches & the entire ""quarterfinals"" of the tournament...the match was short, decent for what it was, and served it's purpose in eliminating all the ""egotistical 8"" random teams from the tournament.

Terrordome X Division Match - Due to Kurt Angle's injury, the winner of this match would take his place in the main event.  This structure is similar to WWE's Elimination Chamber in that it's a caged dome with the way to win is to escape through a hole at the top.  With all the X division contendors in this match & them trapped inside this dome, it was a huge cluster which not much room to do anything else except highspots.  So if you like non-stop spotfest then you'll enjoy this but look out for when Kaz went to take down Creed but got shoved off into an Alabama Jam (get well Bobby Eaton) onto Jimmy Rave.

Team 3D vs Christian Cage & Rhino - Cage & Rhino were still selling what happened earlier after their match & Team 3D focused on Christian's neck & head throughout the match.  Average match between all four.

A.J. Styles & Super Eric vs L.A.X. - Styles was selling his mid-section from the crash & burn earlier as the action went back & forth between both teams with it being fast paced action right off the bat with the chain wrestling between A.J. & Homicide.  Hopefully on the DVD, they'll switch the camera angle to hide the heavily botched pinfall since A.J.'s shoulders weren't flat on the mat.  This was the best tag match in the tournament yet.

Makerover Battle Royal/Ladder Match - All the knockouts are in the battle royal & the final two will wrestle in a Ladder Match with the winner getting a title shot while the loser gets her head shaved...except for Gail Kim who won immunity so if she loses then the last knockout eliminated in the battle royal would get her shaved.  Just like any time TNA has a multiperson match that has more than one stage (ala ""Queen Of The Cage"" at LockDown), they got the first stage over with pretty quickly as the only thing noteworthy in the battle royal was Khan tossing Hemme out but instead of straight to the floor, Hemme hit the apron hip first on the way down.  The Ladder Match was between Gail & Roxxi with Angelina Love being the one who should get shaved if Gail loses so she constantly kept interfearing with Velvet Sky getting involved as well.  The battle royal part wasn't anything special as it was just a way to shove all the knockouts onto the PPV but the Ladder Match was just bad because of the constant interfearence from ""The Beautiful People"" (TNA can't think of a better name than that?) made this match a dud.  The crowd was chanting ""Fire Russo"" afterwards during the headshaving but with the booking of this match, you could see why.

L.A.X. vs. Team 3D - Before the match even got started, all 4 men were brawling on the outside.  This used the typical babyface/heel formula as Team 3D kept working over Homicide throughout most of match building to the hot tag for Hernandez before all four got into it each other ending with L.A.X. regaining the Tag Team Titles...ironically from the team who beat them for it 13 months earlier.  One moment to really look out for was when Johnny Devine came to ringside & got into a confrontation with Hector Guerrero resulting in a double stomp through a table.

TNA Champion Samoa Joe vs Kaz vs Scott Steiner - This was a good main event as they went non-stop with nobody looking like a weak link or being carried by both men.  Kaz looked like he deserved to be in that match which is impressive considering all the bumping around he did earlier in the night & how he's been booked all year.  Steiner put on one of his strongest performances in months and even dominating both men at various parts of the match while Joe put on the type of performance you would expect from him while doing a great job selling that his shoulder was hurt.

In the end, this was far from a classic & would have been an above average PPV except the knockouts match & the ""Lethal Lottery/Egotistical 8"" tournament rounds really dragged this PPV down & took time away from the other matches that were average to good.  This PPV illistrates the problem with TNA right now which was the same problems that existed somewhat in WCW that the wrestling talent is there but they're using the ""quantity over quality"" formula by trying to shove all the talent on every card & the poor illogical booking making the product look bad and at times, a joke.  Anyways, I would give this PPV 2.5 stars but since we can't do half stars, I'll be nice & round it up to 3 so unless your a diehard fan of tag team wrestling...this is one event I would skip.",1211068800,,7615,4.472924187725631
