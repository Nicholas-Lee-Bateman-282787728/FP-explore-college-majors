3939478,5,B002JYPV7W,I just tried the workout and it was great!  I love being able to take a real yoga class in the comfort of my own home.  I don't always have time to schedule a class so this DVD is perfect for me.  The workout was challenging and easy to follow.  The explanation of the poses was easy to follow.  This is definately not a DVD that will collect dust in my closet.,1259712000,,361,3.9583333333333335
3939479,5,B002JYPV7W,"I have to admit straight from the top that when I saw the promo clip for this dvd at totalfitnessdvds, I was not impressed.  Then after I got the dvd and previewed it, I was still not impressed.  Then, this morning I did the entire dvd (I had a rare 90 minutes to myself)and I was quite supprised that I enjoyed it, worked hard and felt good afterwards. The best aspect of this class is the preciseness in the execution of the poses.  Iyengar would be proud.  On every single pose, the angles were perfect.  You will not injure yourself.  Here is what you get in the dvd:

Full vinyasa practice 60 minutes.  This class starts seated and then goes into a down dog, up dog sequence.  Next is sun salutation C followed by several standing poses such as: warrior 1, warrior 2, warrior 3, twisting lunge, triangle, extended side angle, half hanumanasana, crescent pose with shoulder stretch, pyramid, standing split, wide side angle, goddess pose (wide legs bent knees) with shoulder stretch, wide angle forward bend with hands clasped behind back, side plank, quad stretch in low lunge position, seated twist.  She does the poses in a flow format with plank, pushup, up dog or cobra to down dog in between.  There are lots of push ups and once the flow starts there are no breaks until you rest in pigeon.  The back bending sequence is very simple but hard.  You do bridge pose holding one leg in the air. I may have missed a pose or two but what you will get is a class mostly of basic standing poses that are designed to cook your legs. The poses are not overly creative ala Shiva Rea; but they are held long enough for you to feel your muscles work.  If you are a beginner, this flow will challenge you to keep your form and keep up.  It moves at a moderate pace with no breaks. Although Stephanie does encourage you to rest in child's pose  whenever you need to.  To my suprise, I rested quite a bit.  If you are an intermediate yogi, you too will be challenged to keep your form while moving from pose to pose and doing all of the push ups. I appreciated that there was a student on the dvd that did modifications with a block and strap.  There are no seated poses here other than seated twist.

Abs routine 30 minutes:  This is the hardest abs routine I have ever seen on a yoga dvd.  I struggled through this section.  The hardest poses were dolphin side plank and dolphin twist hip lifts.  (watch the clip at yoga journal to see what I mean) She also includes simple backbends,lunge and side gate stretch in this section. This section also includes thread the needle shoulder stretch and ends in wide legged child's pose.

I must mention that all the poses with their sanskrit and english names appear at the top left of the screen.

Pose guide 5 minutes:  Stephanie goes over the proper form for chatarunga with do's and dont's.

About the teacher:  Stephanie is in voice over and gives excellent precise, timely instruction.  Her instruction is do detailed that you will not need to look at the screen, unless you want to check your form. She talks...a lot, giving form pointers. Which leads me to the question ""Who is this dvd for?"" It is for advanced beginners to intermediate students.  Advanced students may be bored as there are no arm balances, no inversions, no intense seated stretching and no upward bow. It is also for those who don't like their yoga dancey a la Shiva Rea, or super fast. It for those who like a clean, straight forward, classic yoga class with excellent instruction.  If that's you, then get this dvd.  It is challenging enough so that you can grow into it. Unless you are in great shape you will sweat and feel proud of yourself that you got through it.",1259193600,128,3688,4.473053892215569
3939480,5,B002JYPV7W,"The yoga practice on this DVD will change your life!  Stephanie Snyder is a wonderful teaching with amazing insight and teaching skills that are second to none.  This dvd is classic yoga that is uupdated and sequenced to challenge and fulfill anyone who follows along.  It can be physically demanding but the results & rewards after practicing with Stephanie's dvd are great!

This dvd is a very good tool for anyone who wants to practice yoga at home.  There are options for modifying the poses and Stephanie's direction are very easy to follow.  The vinyasa practice is invigorating and moves at a very comfortable pace.  The poses flow easily from one to the next, taking you through a well thought out practice.

The Core Strengthening section of the dvd is one of the best core workouts I've ever done.  Yes, it is challenging but the results are so great.  You will definitely know that you've worked your entire core section when you are done with this.  It is the type of core work that gets results and you will want to do it over and over again.

Stephanie Snyder is a fantastic teacher and I have been able to take her class in San Francisco.  The dvd is just like being in her class but having her all to yourself.  This dvd is a must have for the anyone who does yoga at home - trust me, even if you don't do yoga at home, you will with this jewel!!",1254700800,23,1362,4.396
3939481,2,B002JYPV7W,"This was a really boring yoga DVD.  The instructions were very detailed, and it was a good sequence, which was good, but the setting was an empty room with bare walls, and just a faint disco beat for music.  There was no commentary such as encouragement, reinforcing the benefits of yoga, etc.  Just plain instruction.  I did the entire 60 minute routine and had no desire to ever play this DVD again.  I've tried many yoga DVDs, several of which I liked (especially Maral Hadidi and Kerry Bestwick), but I just did not like this one.",1453852800,,534,4.520833333333333

3939483,5,B002JYPV7W,Another great yoga journal DVD. I like the pacing on this one as compared to other yoga DVD's but compared to other yoga journal DVDs this pacing on this one is faster. It's less instructional and more follow the poses and flow. I would not recommend this to beginners and those who want to take time and adjust well into a certain pose. It's more cardio than alignment if you're into that.,1451088000,2,390,4.430555555555555
3939484,5,B002JYPV7W,Stephanie Snyder is one of my favorite yoga instructors I've taken at the national level. Extremely knowledgeable and kind. I recommend this DVD both for her as an instructor and for Yoga Journal for always publishing high quality work.,1447632000,,236,5.076923076923077
3939485,5,B002JYPV7W,"One of the BEST yoga videos that I've EVER purchased.  I thought it was going to be a fairly easy flow sequence, what I found is that while it is a series of flows, I was sweating like crazy and actually sore the next day!  I would recommend for all levels of practice.",1441065600,,269,4.056603773584905

3939487,5,B002JYPV7W,"This is a comprehensive yoga video that is 1 hour and 25 minutes. The video is made up of many different routines that also incorporate up dog, chataranga, plank and down dog. I recommend this video if you do yoga regularly already. The routines are challenging so I don't recommend this for beginners.

It is hard to do the whole video, so I think that a 20 minute routine a few times a week, is enough to see some results.",1437523200,,424,4.3
3939488,5,B002JYPV7W,One of the best yoga DVDs I have ever tried in all of my 12 years of experience. I am addicted to this one! It is challenging enough and she is very good at explaining how to do each pose. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good work out. I sweat more doing this than I do on an elliptical or treadmill at the gym. This is better than yoga X (p90x) because it isn't as long. I make time to do this at least 3 times a week. It has helped heal my shoulder and neck injuries from a car accident. Can't say enough about this one!! Try it!,1435104000,,542,3.8482142857142856

3939492,5,B002JYPV7W,I used this video to kick my husband's butt- on a day he said you can't get a good workout at home.  He made it 14 minutes in (and is a regular runner) before having to take a break.  So good for a beginner/intermediate to get a good workout in!,1400025600,,245,3.88
3939493,3,B002JYPV7W,"If you are interested in a super run-of-the-mill, no frills, average-as-heck yoga video, you've found it. The instruction is somewhat below average, and the instructor herself, at times, seems bored. The postures are all the same ones you'd find on any other video, EXCEPT, that the toning portion contains enough pilates that one would question whether or not it should be called 'yoga for toning' at all. I think a better title for this workout is ''Pilates for Toning, Yoga for strength.'' In the pilates portion, this below-average instruction does make for suboptimal pilates workout - both in terms of safety and results.
The cover says it all, really, when it shows her in a pilates move, in bright colors next to a wall. Shot in a closed room, the only thing that inspires is the brightly contrasting colors chosen for the instructor and her compadre - certainly its not the sound, instruction, nor workout quality.",1393718400,6,923,4.923076923076923

3939495,5,B002JYPV7W,"The teacher's instructions are clear and easy to follow once you have watched her perform the asanas once or twice before trying to follow the video directly.  It gives me my most challenging yoga workout, even though it does not contain anything so advanced as a headstand.  I find it very useful for strengthening and toning the thighs, core, and arms just as the routine is meant to do.",1392076800,,389,4.6231884057971016

3939497,5,B002JYPV7W,I'm a beginner in yoga and this one was quite the workout for me. I think it will be a good routine to work up to and watch myself progress to do the harder stretches.,1390262400,,167,3.8
3939498,5,B002JYPV7W,"I love this video. I used to practice yoga three-four times per week. I'm now down to just one, and trying to get back into my former form. This video is tough. It runs at an hour and twenty some minutes. I've been able to make it through 50 minutes thus far. It's a goal each week to get further. She doesn't stop for anything, and she holds the poses for a very long time, which is what makes it challenging. I like the basic format. She has someone next to her doing the modifications. I enjoy the fact that it's quiet and peaceful. Her voice isn't obnoxious, you barely notice her once you get into your practice. There is mention that it will take some time to get through this entire practice and really own it, which is a welcome challenge for me. I would recommend this video to those who have done yoga before and are looking for the next step (intermediary).",1389139200,6,868,4.298780487804878
3939499,5,B002JYPV7W,I did this workout 10 times before going to an actual YOGA studio for classes.  That's when I realized that I actually learned a lot about YOGA in this program.,1384819200,,160,4.333333333333333
3939500,5,B002JYPV7W,Build heat and strength. Release stress through integrated breathwork. Excellent practice for the home! Just wish they had a total body short practice as well as the long 60 minute one. Sometimes (a lot of times) there are just not enough minutes in the day to complete a 60 minute practice.,1379548800,2,291,4.7254901960784315
3939501,5,B002JYPV7W,"I never post feedback, but I really loved this yoga video. Stephanie Snyder leads perfectly and I was able to follow without even watching some of the time. She does a lot of chaturangas and vinyasas so be forewarned. It is the perfect intermediate workout for those that practice yoga several times per month. I rented it the first go around and will purchase this video now!",1377216000,,376,4.626865671641791
3939502,3,B002JYPV7W,This is my first yoga video and I am definitely a beginner yoga-ist so this video was very fast paced for me. I couldn't find any time to relax while trying to keep up with the positions. Also she repeats a lot of the same positions which left me a little disappointed since the video isn't very long to start with.,1375315200,,315,4.180327868852459
3939503,2,B002JYPV7W,"It is an ok routine for moderate yogis. i am much more into the power yoga that GAIAM's Rodney Yee CD's are about & found this to be slow moving. However; as a Physical Therapist, I do find this to be a good toning workout for not so advanced yogi's.",1373241600,4,250,4.02
3939504,5,B002JYPV7W,I am a yoga newbie and I couldn't do all the poses as the instructors did (this is definitely an advanced DVD) but I felt so good after. I have watched other videos with Ms. Snyder and I love her style of teaching.,1373155200,,214,4.0

3939506,4,B002JYPV7W,"This DVD is fine for the occasional workout style yoga practice. It is a little boring and repetitive for me. After practicing and teaching for over 10 years, it is hard to find a DVD that isn't boring. However, if you want something that will work your body and not be too full if yoga philosophy, this DVD makes a good addition to your library. Not for beginners.",1371686400,2,365,4.382352941176471
3939507,5,B002JYPV7W,"I have been searching for a yoga dvd that is both a real workout and real yoga. I absolutely love this. Depending on the day I can't always get through the entire 60 minute training, but I will when my arm strength increases a little more. I love the constant instruction, because when I do yoga there is at least one small child in the living room with me doing something involving running around, crashing things together, and asking me questions constantly. The constant instruction helps me keep on track with the yoga while I yell ""stop that, I don't know, stop torturing your sister!"" over and over.

I rented the video from Amazon instant video to try it out first, which I think is an excellent option by the way. The quality of the video is fine, the reason I gave the instant video version 3 stars is that (at least with my blu ray player) there is no way to pause, rewind or fast forward instant video. This means if you would like to do the second 30 minute session you will have to do the 60 minute session first and then the 30 minute next time. This is not a big deal when you're just trying it out but I certainly wouldn't purchase the video this way, when I knew for sure how much I enjoyed it I bought the DVD version instead.",1371600000,3,1244,4.271186440677966
3939508,5,B002JYPV7W,"I thought I was in great shape until this!- Excellent combinations of exercises, perfect timing and cueing. Best yoga video I have (and I have a lot!) Don't let the instructor's sweet smile fool you - this is a challenging video!",1368489600,,229,4.609756097560975
3939509,5,B002JYPV7W,"Stephanie Snyder's voice is so soothing that you feel transported to the Amazon or a spa. She's right on target with her timing and pointers and very descriptive with how you should be moving. Her pointed instruction makes it easier to focus and complete the movements with the correct form. The 60 minute balanced section is great for all because it is challenging for those who may not be as flexible and it is easy enough (with modifications performed by another woman on screen) that you can complete some form of the movements and feel accomplished. However, be ready to ache when you try the 30 minute core exercise. It is intense and difficult and your abs will be chastising you afterwards. Good luck!",1367280000,,709,4.725806451612903

3939512,4,B002JYPV7W,I was looking for a yoga DVD to compliment my other fitness endeavors and this one fits the bill.  The yoga part is about 55 minutes which feels about right (although I was expecting 90) and it has a well paced consistent flow.  What I found most helpful is that because of the voice instructions I did not have to look at the screen most of the time (unless a new move popped up).  I could listen and follow which helped me relax and enjoy the practice.  The down side of this DVD (this the 4 instead of 5 stars) is the core workout at the end which I bailed on.  The moves were not particularly challenging however if you're looking for a light ab workout this might be great.,1361318400,,678,4.184615384615385
3939513,4,B002JYPV7W,"Solid, well-paced and challenging for the intermediate yogi. A good add to the DVD library but the one complaint is that the instructor is flat and technical - she is kind of boring. But the workout is worth it.",1361145600,,211,4.435897435897436
3939514,5,B002JYPV7W,"I thought she was great. We do this video every other day now.  Very pleased with it.  This is a challenging intermediate class, with good overall workout and a lot of arm/shoulder opening things, and lots of thigh work.  I was concerned from the look of it that this would be too pilate-like but not at all.  I like her a lot, she talks you through breath the whole time, and while its not VERY spiritual, it is a nice work out and she thoroughly talks you through the moves.  I vote her for best buddha-like ahimsa gaze of any yoga video teacher.",1360454400,2,548,4.281553398058253

3939516,5,B002JYPV7W,"I was looking for a more challenging workout, similar to the Vinyasa Flow class I do at my local yoga studio. I did this workout this morning for the first time after downloading it to my Kindle Fire. It was great to have the instructor right next to my mat! There is not much warm up, but once you get going there is a lot of strength work for legs, standing twists, and good variations for easier levels of the more challenging poses. I will be doing this on a regular basis. Haven't done the core workout yet, but I've looked through it. Looks like a good combination of yoga and pilates. It's nice to have the two workouts to do together, if I have time, or to alternate between days.",1359072000,,688,4.259541984732825

It still continues to be a challenge, which is why it is in constant rotation on my video playlist.",1341878400,,329,4.344262295081967
3939526,4,B002JYPV7W,"I enjoyed this yoga routine immensely. I have been doing yoga classes and following videos for a while but I do not consider myself an advanced practitioner. I thought this video was challenging in that some poses are held for a long period or some of the moving sequences include four to six poses before returning to downward dog. Further, there isn't a moving/holding poses phase and a stretching phase; rather the strenuous is mixed evenly with the relaxing. This keeps you active and working throughout the first 50-53 minutes. With the exception of the crane pose (which every class and video seems to include.) I did not think any of the poses were too difficult to perform.
The abs and fitness portion are seperate, which is a shame. The video raps up the yoga fitness routine with a final relaxtion and then moves on to the abs portion. It's not a negative, you just have to skip ahead if you want to include the abs routine in the yoga workout.

I would recommend the video to anyone who has done a little yoga previously and is familiar with some of the common poses. The video is not for beginners; the narrator regularly only says the sanskrit names of moves (even common ones) and there is little instruction on how to perform poses.",1337472000,2,1247,4.591928251121076

I run and ride a bike pretty much every day, I'm in a fairly decent shape and I found myself sweating 10-15 min into the video but had no problem completing the entire hour and a half- with an exception of one pose, which I believe may take quite a while to train.  Definitely would recommend for anyone.",1315872000,6,489,4.373626373626373
3939530,5,B002JYPV7W,"This DVD is a butt-kicker. It is nearly a total body workout. It goes through a good warm-up, then it works your upper body, lower body, and core quite thoroughly, stretching all along the way. I work out a lot, not just with yoga, and I find this to be the most efficient hour of fitness in my week. If I only have a few days a week to work out, I do this DVD for those three days. It has cured the pain from my old rotator cuff injury, and it has done wonders for my hamstrings.

WHAT DOES IT WORK?
This routine is great for quads, gluts, core, and shoulders. It provides a lot of balance, which is great because I hate spending time on rotator cuff exercises and the like.

WHAT DOES IT NEGLECT?
This routine doesn't hit your pulling muscles at all, so it is good to supplement with pull-ups or something similar. It includes a fair amount of pushing (e.g., yoga push-up/dive bombers), but if your a guy, you probably can do a lot more, so supplement with push-ups and dips.  To be fair, my wife, who is also very fit, finds the upper body portion of this DVD to be very challenging. You could also hit your calves a lot harder on other days.",1309564800,2,1145,4.195454545454545
3939531,4,B002JYPV7W,"Good video but too many jump backs.  It seems that jump backs become ""fillers"" for time in yoga videos.  Good poses and instructions for poses in between jump backs, however.  The abs part is super.  Very  strengthening and toning.",1307232000,2,231,4.82051282051282

3939533,5,B002JYPV7W,"After following quite a few yoga videos, I found this one to be by far the best. I've only been doing yoga for 2 months, can do most of the intermediate poses, and am attracted to the practice for the intensity of the workout and how much it pushes me, and not necessarily for the spirituality/mental health aspect of it.

This video is precisely perfect for getting to the point of the physicality of the practice, and is quite sparing of long introductions, profound messages about the self, coaxing words of peace and inner joy, etc compared to other videos. There is only a very short intro before the instructor gets straight into the poses. The intensity builds up and you find yourself sweating a lot within 20 minutes. She explains the poses well without compromising intensity and the asanas have both flow and variety.

Am very pleased with this product and will probably buy the video (am only renting now).",1302048000,8,918,4.695652173913044

I have had wonderful results with this style of yoga and really enjoy it.  It is very active, challenging and invigorating.

The sequence she created is easy to follow but not easy to do.  Poses are very challenging but not discouraging.  I highly recommend this.",1291161600,,439,4.931506849315069

That being said, I just didn't seem to tap into my usual 'yogic energy' while going through the poses. The instructor's voiceover is very flat with no humor or inspiration infused into it. I like my yoga to be a good workout, but to be a little more on the spiritual side (jivamukti, kripalu, anusara). The pictures on the screen were also incredibly uninteresting. There was a lot of instruction, which may be good for beginners, but which I find to be distracting.",1280793600,12,639,4.517241379310345
3939541,4,B002JYPV7W,"Stephanie Snyder teaches at Yoga Tree in San Francisco and I have been to her classes.  The vinyasa routine was way to slow for me and spent too much time explaining basic things that experienced yogis already know.  People fairly new new to yoga who want a strong vinyasa class should like this.

I could not do the core routine past the first set of exercises because it hurt my back.  Actually it didn't hurt my back because I didn't actually do them but I fast forwarded through the entire 30 minutes and I know all the excersises would have had me laid up in pain.  I think part of her back ground is Forest yoga and I have found that Forest yoga is awful for people with back problems.

Stephanie is a very good teacher and extremely popular in the Bay Area.  However, avoid her style if you have back problems.",1277683200,3,817,4.3355263157894735
3939542,4,B002JYPV7W,"I was looking for an intermediate vinyasa flow DVD and this is it! The 60 minute flow portion is just that, you are constantly moving and work up a sweat. The music in the background that some people have complained about I did not find annoying or out of the norm at all. In fact it's almost so soft at times I didn't even realize there was music playing. Yes the backdrop is just a painted wall but I was hardly looking at the screen during the practice cause she had me moving so much. The poses comfortably go from one to the other with little to no awkward stop/pauses/weird transitions.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does lack standing balance poses and floor work, but I suppose that is due to the 60 min length as opposed to a longer 90 min class.

Great DVD for intermediate vinyasa, would definitely recommend.",1271030400,3,847,4.320754716981132
3939543,5,B002JYPV7W,"I purchased this DVD through Yoga Journal last week and today was the first chance Ive had to go through it. I did the full flowing set of vinyasa. I agree that the music could have been a little more ""spiritual"" but the work out itself was a dynamic set.
I have been doing yoga for 7 years off and on and this presented a very good workout. I was sweating and even shaking in these poses which is something I have not had for awhile and at my level of experience.
I suggest this for those who 1) are able to hold poses for at least 5-10 breaths. There are many vigorous binding and extended poses that are held for a long time. If you do not have the stamina to do them you can always do as she suggests and go into childs pose but a good foundation with both strength and stamina are definitely required with this DVD. 2) I would not suggest this DVD for beginners. Though she does have a partner in there with her who does modifications its still something I believe that beginners would struggle with. Since struggle would perhaps impede further exploration of yoga I would not recommend this as a starter video. I would call this an intermediate level video. 3) Finally the instructor for this video goes through proper alignment and yoga posture names. She is on the ball and if you find this guiding to be a bit distracting I would try to rent this from your local library first.

On a whole I honestly have nothing to say bad about this DVD. Yes, the music is a bit ""busy"" for what I am used to in my practice but given the level of athleticism to this set I think it still works.
I am so grateful I purchased this set and I cannot wait to develop my practice through her guidance!

Blessings!",1266796800,6,1701,4.246913580246914
3939544,4,B002JYPV7W,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD directly from Yoga Journal.

This latest DVD release from Yoga Journal magazine is intended to build strength as well as to provide toning benefits by offering two vigorous yoga practice sessions.  Both routines are led by Stephanie Snyder, a vinyasa-style instructor known for her rigorous classes and workshops in the San Francisco area.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:  Flowing Vinyasa Practice--Complete Core Practice--Vinyasa Tutorial (a brief review by Stephanie on how to properly perform chaturanga & upward dog)--Play All--Credits.  Stephanie and her assistant, Marie (who shows some modifications) practice in a fairly sparse studio with wood floors, blue walls, and fake ""windows.""  Stephanie teaches via voiceover while fairly up-tempo music plays in the background.  Stephanie cues in both English and Sanskrit, and both the English and Sanskrit names for the postures appear on screen.  (One additional note:  Stephanie and Marie have their mats oriented so that they are facing sideways; I found this confusing, as I was never looking at the TV and could not see what what they were doing. I found it easier to follow the practice when I turned my mat so that the short edge was facing the TV.)

Stephanie describes the Flowing Vinyasa Practice as ""yoga for fitness.""  Given this, it is important to note that there are down dog to chaturanga to up dog vinyasa transitions throughout this ENTIRE 55-minute routine, from the beginning right up until the very end.  In addition, Stephanie also frequently transitions using a 3-legged down-dog pose (i.e., swinging one leg up into the air and then forward).  Stephanie begins this practice on hands and knees, immediately coming into dog pose for some down dog to plank flows.  She then moves into several repetitions of sun salutation A with low lunge (half-split is also included) and then sun salutation B with high lunge.  The sun salutations conclude with a chair twist.  Stephanie then introduces several different series of standing pose flows.  Her sequencing is fairly unique--for example, the very first sequence is a high lunge series which includes a challenging balance posture, warrior 3, crescent lunge with cow-face arms, and a lunge twist.  Postures in the next series include warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, side angle pose, and finally triangle with first a half bind and then a full bind.  The last major standing sequence flows from pyramid pose to revolved triangle to standing split to a seated twist.  There is a side plank transition, and then Stephanie concludes the standing work with a wide-angle forward bend and goddess pose with eagle arms.  Transitioning to the floor, Stephanie performs low lunge with a quad stretch, bridge pose with a leg lift, a pigeon (Marie does thread-the-needle as an alternate).  The finishing postures for this practice are a reclined twist and a very brief (2-minute) savasana, although Stephanie does encourage you to hold relaxation pose for at least five minutes.

The Complete Core Practice is 28 minutes long; Stephanie performs this routine alone.  In this practice, Stephanie also begins on hands and knees.  Here she performs a few simple cat/cow flows but adds a pelvic roll to this.  Coming to the back, she starts with a simple crunch and then continues with several Pilates-like movements such as straight-leg lowers, adding a twist to increase the difficulty level.  Returning to an all-fours position, Stephanie comes to her forearms for dolphin plank pose and then performs some challenging side plank work from this position.  Moving through sphinx, she returns to her back to perform a crunch series with the legs in a straddle position.  Next it's back to the dolphin plank stance for some tough oblique work.  After a brief rest, Stephanie once again comes to hands and knees, this time to perform a nice twisting torso stretch.  Following this, Stephanie returns to her back, where she offers three options for revolved stomach pose, and then moves into a double crunch.  At this point, she flips onto her stomach for a brief back strength series involving arm and leg lifts.  The finishing postures for this routine are performed as a flow all on one side, then are repeated on the other as follows:  down dog, low lunge, side angle prep (kneeling), side stretch (gate pose), plank, and cobra.  There is no savasana for this practice, although Stephanie recommends concluding with a final relaxation.

These demanding practices are definitely not appropriate for those new to yoga.  With the exception of the Tutorial, Stephanie does not provide much information on form or alignment, making this DVD more appropriate for those who are at least at an advanced beginner level.  Furthermore, I would recommend this DVD to someone who is fairly physically fit to start, and I would suggest that anyone with wrist issues approach the Vinyasa practice with caution.  I believe that these routines would be best suited for experienced yogis who prefer a more athletic-style yoga practice.  Clips are available on the Yoga Journal web site to help you determine whether this DVD would meet your needs.",1264896000,27,5217,5.0977620730270905

Her cueing is EXCELLENT.....and I know alot about Cueing...I was a fitness instructor for 15+ years.  She is very skilled at it and this makes a huge difference.  The workout is enjoyable AND challenging which is a tough combo for most DVD's/instructors' to create I think.  A Big thank you to Ms. Synder for her work!!",1262995200,5,490,4.843373493975903
3939547,5,B002JYPV7W,"What I love about this DVD is that unlike other workouts it does not make you sit in one pose for 20 plus breaths. I love Baron Baptiste's Journey Into Power Yoga 2 but soem of the poses he holds for longer than I can withstand. Same with Bryan Kest, who's DVD I alternate with Baptiste's. This is a new addition to my yoga DVD collection and is THE PERFECT workout that I've been looking for. Poses are held for a consistent 5 - 10 breaths, it targets all muscle groups within one hour, and there are no anoying new age metaphors used. While I'm pretty advanced in yoga, certain poses that force me to use my thigh muscles are still diiffcult for me. There are comfortable yet challenging modifications of the poses on this DVD. This is really the perfect workout. Not too short, not too long, filled with modifications, sans any irritating allegories with appropriate music to match.",1261094400,5,885,4.5375
3939548,5,B002JYPV7W,"I have tried all of the DVD at once and today I'm sore all over , especially in the legs and abs. The main 55 minute practice is quite a typical power vinyasa routine that is not too fast similar to Bryan Kest for example. It focuses on standing poses such as different lunge variations , hero 3 , half split , revolved triangle & chair and goddess poses with eagle arms etc.. , my butt and legs were working hard and they were shaking at one point. Other poses include side plank , seated twist , bridge (also one legged) & pigeon. I liked that she saved the pigeon for after the backbends. There's a short shavasana. The 28 minute core routine is tough but doable , I found the crunches a little boring since there are a lot of reps although there are a lot of nice variations. I liked that she did plank variations in between the sets of the crunches for a nice ""break"" so you don't do all of the supine ab work at once .After the ab work she continues with some light backbends and lower back exercises like swimming. She ended with stretches for the illiopsoas and obliques which worked hard ( low lunge, side gate prep and a modified side plank) and child pose. The music is general and not interesting but not intrusive. Stephanie's cueing and instruction are clear and helpful. Overall a good and balanced routine that is challenging with no super advanced poses and still there's a modifier demonstrating easier variations.",1261094400,8,1432,4.469465648854962

Stephanie is concise and precise, she gives great instruction through each pose, allowing you to get deeper into the poses.  I also found that the 5 minute instruction is great, since some of the poses she focuses on can be performed incorrectly and cause strain or discomfort.  This video helps to develop both strength and flexibility and is at a great pace.  You remain in each pose for a good amount of time,  yet it flows from one sequence to the next comfortably.  The 30 minute core is a bonus and a great challenge when time is limited.  The music is lame, but who cares  -- I sweat!

It is challenging, and it is a full body stretch and toning sequence. There is an additional 30 min ab workout included, which is very effective at building your core. I wouldn't recommend combining the main sequence with this ab flow unless you are at a really high level of physical fitness. It is very intense but enjoyable at the same time.

If you're a beginner, here's a tip: Maria, the yogi in the video offers small modifications. There are a few really challenging poses you can do with your knee down if you're not advanced enough for it to be comfortable, since her modifications are often still too advanced for most.

There's really only one pose that is beyond the ability of a typical intermediate yogi - the standing split - so when that part comes I try just try my best.
