2655670,5,B000ICM5QM,"At last I can finally see the Pluto cartoons that I've missed, beautifully done with intelligent and genuinely fascinating commentaries.

Well done, boy.",1169078400,2,153,5.6521739130434785
2655671,5,B000ICM5QM,"I bought this collection because I'm a fan of both Disney and animation; but, knowing that Disney had a rep for squeaky-clean characters, I didn't realize these cartoons would be as funny as they are! It seems over the years Pluto's humor became totally forgotten by cartoon fans...but this is one funny character.

As I watched these cartoons I began to realize that some of these could very well be mistaken for Looney Tunes, as the humor occasionally gets frenetic and fast-paced.....if Pluto didn't show up, you'd think these were done by the whackos at Warner Brothers (I intend ""whackos"" in a good way, believe me!).

Pluto's bravado yapping is what gets me cracking up...for example, he pretends to act macho by yapping furiously (as he hides behind a fence) at Butch the Bulldog - and runs away as Butch approaches! There are many other hilarious examples of his yapping throughout the set.

You'll be astonished at the OUTSTANDING job the animators did with Pluto's facial expressions and wonder how they were able to convey to the audience exactly what Pluto was thinking, without him uttering a single word; this is amazing work that we have taken for granted when we watch cartoons.

I also noticed the similarities between Pluto and Donald Duck - these two are the ONLY legendary Disney cartoon characters that actually get mad, pull underhanded pranks, cheat (Pluto checks a gumball machine to see if there's any loose change!) and occasionally prey on the weak. Ya think Mickey would do that? NAH!

Also included in this set are the complete Figaro The Cat cartoons (there are only a few, but the short ""Figaro & Cleo"" is shown TWICE: in the ""Bonus Features"" segment and the ""From The Vault"" segment...why?)

I hope you purchase this set; I bought it, intending to be nostalgic and mildly amused but found myself laffing out loud at ol' Pluto...I think you will, too.",1168819200,15,1882,4.829192546583851
2655672,5,B000ICM5QM,"With volume 2 Pluto collections can be complete! This is a wonderful addition to the Treasures series in every way. The cartoons inlcuded on this disc are wonderfully entertaining.

Picture quality is good, a number of shorts have obviously been restored a few have not, but they still look good for 50 years old and it certainly is more than acceptable and will not distract from your viewing pleasure. All shorts are provided uncut and three Figaro cartoons are also thrown in for good measure.

Bonus features are light but still very entertaining. Do you ever get the feeling when listening to an audio commentary that the people giving want to pause the film or rewind it or show something frame by frame or slow down the action? Well that is what the master class bonus features are, basically they are audio/visual commentaries where they pause the action and discuss certain frames, so even though the cartoon itself is only about 7 minutes the master classes go on for 10-15 minutes. A brilliant idea! I must admit I was slightly disappointed the galleries don't have any of the original posters.",1167696000,4,1105,4.810526315789474
2655673,5,B000ICM5QM,"I just picked this up today, and I haven't even started watching it yet, so I apologize for not reviewing the content.

I did, however, notice that the 'Certificate of Authenticity' states that this set is limited to only 65,000 copies.

This is one of the most limited pressings of all the 'Disney Treasures'

The valuable 'Goofy' collection was limited to 125,000.

Geez, they made 250,000 copies of 'On The Front Lines'!!",1167177600,14,424,4.847222222222222
2655674,5,B000ICM5QM,"This final collection of PLUTO cartoons includes some never before available on home video!  Also included are the three FIGARO cartoons UNCENSORED with the black mammy.

Comparing those cartoons that were previously released on DVD, this all looks like a new film to video transfer for this set.  Don't expect the restoration work like on the Mickey Mouse Treasures, but they are an improvement over last year's Chronological Donald Volume 2.

2655675,5,B000ICM5QM,"Around this time of year, I always check out 'Disney treasures' on the Amazon search to see what my favourite studio is treating me to for Christmas. I am not disappointed this year.

Volume 2 of The Complete Pluto was always going to happen and is most welcome. No news yet on content and extras but its fair to say that they should be up to the excellent standard of the previous volumes.",1162684800,6,390,4.342465753424658
2655676,5,B000ICM5QM,"My husband loves Pluto, his absolute favorite character, but it is so hard to find products that are only Pluto. When I found this DVD collection, I knew he would love it, and he does. So does my 4 year old niece. Every time she comes to visit she spends the whole time watching this collection.",1273622400,,295,4.285714285714286
2655677,5,B000ICM5QM,"Never before available in a comprehensive collection. Images and instances from early, classic Disney cartoons have been referred to, referenced and utilized for innumerable licensed products, fine art, current entertainment in all media as well as at the theme parks. In addition, they remain terribly entertaining. What more can you ask for?",1235779200,3,343,5.615384615384615
2655678,4,B000ICM5QM,I'm a fan of animation. And what collection would be complete without the Disney shorts from times past. A most enjoyable diversion with educational special features. The shorts are charming just as Disney intended. Not as edgy as the Warner Brothers/MGM bunch but they did occupy a different market nich.,1229817600,,305,5.12
2655679,5,B000ICM5QM,This brought back so many childhood memories and i can not wait to share it with my little boy as soon as he is old enough to watch.,1215216000,,132,3.75
2655680,4,B000ICM5QM,This is a great series and the collection is spectacular.  I do like Pluto as a character but the it is the Walt disney treasures collection as a whole that I love.,1179100800,2,164,4.125
2655681,5,B000ICM5QM,"Shipping was relatively fast and the DVD is in excellent shape. And Plute, so far is the funniest set of collection I have watched so far.",1175904000,2,138,4.346153846153846
2655682,5,B000ICM5QM,"First of all I'd like to start off my review of this DVD by saying what a marvelous collection of cartoons this is except Lenorad Maltin pops up again to give his lecture's as he did in previous sets, ok Lenorad it's a different speech but the same idea, we all get the picture so stop repeating yourself again.

Secondly I hear that the ""Disney Treasures"" is comming to and end, I hope it doesent because Donald Duck isin't finished and we could include Chip 'N' Dale's 3 starring shorts in one of them plus Ludwig von Drake could get his own collection.",1173657600,4,555,4.388349514563107
2655683,4,B000ICM5QM,Great! The next volume of The complete Pluto is like the first: Une merveille d'animation et de nostalgie!,1172102400,4,106,4.944444444444445
2655684,5,B000ICM5QM,Pluto is really not a talking character so his dog face says it all.  My small kids love his cartoons because they don't have to understand a lot of words to know what's going on and enjoy the humor.  Every Pluto cartoon shows the Disney studio mastery of conveying emotions and communication with a dog nosed smurk.  Great family entertainment.,1171584000,5,345,4.716666666666667
2655685,5,B000ICM5QM,"Pluto is one of the unique characters in Disney cartoons where the animal behaves like an animal. Humor and wit are created through the context of the story, requiring a more involved plot-line, and through the facial expressions and responses of the characters to their environment and each other.

Although this is a fantastic DVD set, it would have been nice if in addition to the pencil sketches and deconstruction of ""Pluto's Judgment Day"" the actual cartoon was provided as well. Currently you can only get this cartoon from the Disney Treasures - Mickey Mouse in Living Color Volume 1 which is becoming increasingly difficult to find at a reasonable price. It was released as a Mickey Mouse cartoon primarily because it was produced at a time before Disney started providing character spin-off cartoons and Pluto was a minor enough character at the time to just be known as Mickey's dog.

Although it's disappointing to not see the original release of ""Pluto's Judgment Day"", the rest of the set does a nice job of rounding off Pluto's character and providing great fun for kids of all ages. Where I might have some concerns of children imitating Goofy and getting hurt (ala Jacka**'s popularity on MTV) the Pluto cartoons are understood as wholesome kid-friendly fun.",1170720000,5,1275,4.953271028037383

8145232,4,B000ICM5QM,"I didn't buy it when I saw at Best Buy years ago. Then the collectors and speculators bought them all. The only other place I have seen these toons lately is if you stay at the California Grand ($700 per night). So these are a rare treat indeed. The box is in perfect new condition. If DVDs are still around, I will put it in my Will, to who ever is the biggest Disney fan in my circle. I just paid over twice as much for Donald Volume 4, so this was ""such-a-deal"".",1394496000,,465,4.010752688172043
8145233,5,B000ICM5QM,"The second release of Wave 6 The Complete Pluto volume 2 includes all the remaining shorts not included on the first volume of Complete Pluto. The shorts on this set have had some restoration done and most of them look bright and very clean. The biggest problem with this set is that there are only 26 shorts(including bonus shorts) and the extras seem a little light. The bonus material includes some Disney artists describing how Pluto is drawn and how his actions show his emotions. While these are interesting, the extras could have used a little more to pad the set.

The first disc contains 11 shorts and for the first time I would have been happy if they added some of Pluto's other exploits in Mickey Mouse and other Disney character's starring cartoons released on earlier volumes of WDT. There is plenty of room for them, so why stop doubling now?

The second disc holds 15 shorts including some very rare and politically incorrect cartoons. It is nice to see tha addition of the Figaro shorts on this set as well. Some galleries round out the extras for this disc and the set.

This is another great set, but it does seem a little light. I still recommend this set like all of the others so far. It's Disney when it was still Walt Disney!",1378339200,,1249,4.517699115044247
