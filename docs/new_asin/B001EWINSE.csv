8299667,5,B001EWINSE,Fer-De-Lance is a fun film sort of a snakes on a submarine thing. I saw it years ago and had a VHS that I taped off the air. Quality was not so good so I was glad to have the chance to have a better copy. Still not a perfect transfer but much better than what I had. I have not watched Medusa yet but look forward to another B movie!,1428624000,,333,3.704225352112676
8299668,3,B001EWINSE,"Poor picture quality on both with only fair stories, but what can you expect from a dollar store? Medusa has a misleading title (nothing like the Greek Myth).  More of a crime drama. Fer de Lance reminds one of Snakes on a Plane and Snakes on a Train, except this is snakes on a submarine and not nearly as exciting.  However I think this movie was the first to come up with the idea of snakes in a close space",1274227200,2,410,4.1125
