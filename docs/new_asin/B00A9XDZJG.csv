8548785,5,B00A9XDZJG,"My 5 Star Review reflects the workouts in this set only. These are tried and true routines that will benefit you for a life time. I will never part with them. I have nerve damage in my neck/shoulders/arms and CS keeps me moving. These are tough routines, don't let the title fool you. It's more than just stretching.  You receive titles that are not available in their original individual format. SIDE NOTE ABOUT THE PRICING: This title is available at the Classical Stretch site for $45.00 + shipping. Way less than here or other sites.",1367193600,2,537,4.652631578947369
