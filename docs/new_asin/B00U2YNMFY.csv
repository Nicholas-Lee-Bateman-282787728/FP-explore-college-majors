8704306,3,B00U2YNMFY,Not what I expected. The documentary is a collection of interview clips (with basically one camera angle) with various chess experts talking about Fisher.  And there are sub-titles in English. This movie-making technique doesn't lend itself to keeping the viewer's interest. It was interesting but not sure I will keep it in my library..,1507939200,,337,5.2407407407407405

8704308,2,B00U2YNMFY,"I bought this along with Pawn Sacrifice and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bobby-Fischer-Against-the-World/dp/B005CB6MPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bobby Fischer Against the World</a>&nbsp;looking for more biographical content. I rate Requiem last of the 3. I would watch Bobby Fischer Against the World first and then Pawn Sacrifice to compare the actual to scripted events of the 1972 Championship.

Requiem would seem like something used as Extra Features rather than an independent release. It was an hour of interview footage from people who I don't know and don't remember from foreign nations speaking in foreign languages with English subtitles about Fischer. It was insightful but not enough on its own to warrant its own release.

I think they knew that and what angers me the most is the packaging and the facade used to market this footage. The quotes by Fischer on the front may lead you to believe that Fischer is interviewed here. He's not. The pictures on the back give you the impression that this will have video documentary-style footage. It doesn't. They throw a generic photograph in here or there to try to offset the mundane format but that's it. There are no pictures of the actual people/footage used in this feature on the box. The box also says 5.1 Surround Mix which I think is another attempt to fool you into believing that this will be a video documentary. It may be in 5.1 but the fact is laughable due to the actual content.

If you are a chess/Fischer novice and want a video about Fischer to watch potentially with your kids, Requiem is not for you. This should be purchased only if you must have everything (I only know of these 3 videos along with the movie Searching For Bobby Fischer) and viewed last.",1456790400,4,1784,5.144827586206897
