This film reminded me a little of I Spit on Your Grave, but with gay, gay friendly and homophobic characters, and of course lower budget, plus most of the violence against the homophobes was either implied or rather quick. When justice fails gay bashing victims or anyone who's too afraid to come forward, that's the story line of this movie.",1396483200,,458,4.597560975609756
8022738,2,B00026L8QC,"disappointing, having gotten other films by this director i
was sorry for him with this one.  no *real* nudity at all (there has never really
been a story line in any of them anyway so he needs the nudity factor
to have people buy his products ).  don't know if i will buy any of his
work again",1220918400,,294,4.051724137931035
8022739,1,B00026L8QC,"This is seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What a disgrace. It is a shame something so horrible could be produced and actually obtain the title of being a ""movie"". This makes a train wreck look like a butterfly-filled day to Disneyland. I can't find one thing to praise. In all honesty, the film is poorly done porn with a mess of a plot that lacks any sense and yet contradicts itself scene by scene. I feel bad for any actor who was roped into this ""movie"" thinking it would be a legit oppurtunity. I share their embarrassment. This is little more than the attempts of an old man with a video camera finding excuse to film senseless nudity. I want my money back!!!",1150848000,2,683,4.34375
