8371108,4,B002IRO29S,"1808: A boat with valuable cargo is mysteriously set on fire. A special investigator, Won-kyu, is sent in only to face a string of violent murders. Blood Rain is a bloody, mystifying film.

The story in Blood Rain is one of mystery- a whodunit that blends your regular mystery elements with elements of the supernatural to create a mystifying and unique atmosphere. It packs in plenty of twists, some action, and strong violence; the movie really is bloody, with heads being vividly smashed and people being boiled alive. The ending of the film was great, definitely a memorable finale. The story moves at a a consistent pace, usually on the slower side. Occasionally, the storytelling can be confusing as it often jumps from past to present, sometimes concurrently through the editing (similar to the South Korean horror film ""Cinderella""). The film is shot beautifully, amazing costume design and stunning cinematography. The music in the film was also superb, perfectly complimenting the atmosphere/setting of the film. The acting was great.

Overall, Blood Rain is a great mystery film; the cinematography, music, and acting, along with the mystifying story contribute positively to the film; some of the confusing storytelling and editing hinder absolute perfection. Nonetheless, this great mystery is available on Netflix Streaming as of 3/3/13, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

Blood Rain has strong violence and gore.",1362873600,,1469,5.269230769230769
8371109,3,B002IRO29S,"It's as though the producers set out to look like more sophisticated Japanese or Chinese period pieces. As such it's an inferior copy. It's replete with flash backs which seem part of the continuity. That confusion aside, the script itself in chaotic and confusing; it's near-impossible to tell what's happening and why.

Pity the direction/editing and scripting didn't match the very good graphics.

This is an attempt to present a period 'procedural' storyline. The producers must have looked at the best

8371110,5,B002IRO29S,"""Blood Rain"" (""Hyeol-ui Nu"") is one of my favorite, although seldom filmed, genres; the period detective thriller (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Name-of-the-Rose/dp/B0001Z37IG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Name of the Rose</a>).  In a simple formula you take the standard Holmes/Watson archetypes and thrust them into the past into an exotic setting with different rules.

In this case the exotic setting is 1808 Korea during the Joseon Dynasty, on a tiny isolated island called Donghwa famed for its paper making.  The tribute ship from Donghwa, loaded with the paper for the Emperor, has been burned in an act of arson.  This instigates an official investigation from the government to uncover the responsible party for the treasonous act.  Official detective Lee Won-kyu (Cha Seung-weon) arrives on the island and discovers that the problem runs deeper than the burning of the tribute ship.  A series of gruesome murders spark rumors of the vengeful ghost of Kang, a local island ruler who had been executed years ago for the crime of practicing Catholicism.  Detective Lee's sharp intellect cuts through the superstitions of the native islanders, driving towards the true culprit for the crimes.

While in no way a horror film, ""Blood Rain"" delivers on gore and supernatural chills while telling an effective detective drama.  Director Dae-seung Kim wants to keep you guessing as to the true nature of the crimes.  Is it, as detective Lee suspects, a local person with a grudge using the ghost of Kang to cover his or her actions?  Is it, as the locals themselves believe, the long dead spirit of vengeance finally collecting on a debt long due?  The answer may surprise you.

Definitely a bloodier film than most in the genre, ""Blood Rain"" is not for the feint of heart.  A man is drawn and quartered, a spike is thrust into a head and the blood flows like rain.  The DVD case actually emphasizes the gore in the film, making it seem more like a horror story than the detective film that it is, which is a shame, but that is movie marketing for you.

If there is any weakness in ""Blood Rain,"" it is in the slow drawn out pacing capped by a rapid climax and solution.  With a running time of 103 minutes, the majority of the film is dedicated to detective Lee's investigation, with only the last 15 minutes or so being the conclusion.  I know this balance has frustrated some viewers, who feel a bit betrayed by the rapid and ambiguous conclusion.

I personally really enjoyed ""Blood Rain,"" with all of its sweeping pageantry, full of funny hats and ancient court manners, coupled with the dirt and grime of a paper-making factory, and the blood and gore.  Detective Lee is a highly effective character, and his dogged pursuit of the truth keeps a straight line through an otherwise chaotic plot.",1266883200,9,2856,5.036170212765957
