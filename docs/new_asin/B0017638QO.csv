Hating Alison Ashley is based on the novel by Robin Kleine - about a pre-teen girl called Erica Yurken who dreams of being an actress. The story has been modified to instead be teenagers (around age 15) in grade 9. Erica has her dreams of being an actress but at the moment concentrates on being a hypocondriac and trying to navigate her unique family - her father is absent from the picture having taken off, her mum who works as a waiter, her older sister who has a ""blackbelt in being a bitch"", a brother who is lazy and is looking for the easy way out and a younger sister (who is very likeable), Jedda, who has been playing a horse for 7 years.

My favourite storyline in this movie is perhaps the developing relationship between Erica and Barry Hollis (who had only a small wrote in the book). His character is needed to keep the storyline going and his sarcasm is very well written and acted.

My biggest complaint is that Delta Goodrem is in the movie. With such a fantastic cast of new and experienced actors she really does ruin the movie. She looks a lot older than her classmates and her acting is wooden and uninteresting. Thank goodness for Saskia and Alex!

If you can bear to overlook the casting choice of Delta then you will love the film and find that there is something just a little irresistable about.",1310601600,,1438,4.354477611940299
