3043287,1,B000ZOXDFU,This is not a DVD of sketches!  You think you're getting a collection of sketches from the 80's?  Guess again!  It's a SNL over the years talking about who was in the cast and how it changed over the years.,1214611200,21,206,4.1
3043288,4,B000ZOXDFU,"I caught most of this program when it aired on NBC a year or two ago, and I was fascinated by the turmoil behind the scenes that almost killed SNL and the developments that revitalized it in the mid 80s, when I fell in love with the show. I was excited when I learned the special would be coming to DVD so I could put it on my shelf next to the similarly excellent ""First Five Years"" special.

Besides being a solid documentary overview of SNL in the 80s, we get a sampling of important moments, candid commentary and excerpts of the wide range of musical guests over the decade. I was particularly amused to finally see the infamous moment where Charles Rocket uttered the most unmentionable word on television.

The package notes an ""Bonus Featurette"" which turns out to be nearly an hour of extra interviews and clips - essentially deleted scenes from the main show. Nice value!",1206662400,24,881,4.534591194968553
3043289,1,B000ZOXDFU,I've been a fan of SNL since it started in the 1970's. And most of the dvd's that came out over the past few years were very well done and I frequently watch them and when I'm not having a good day they gives me some well needed laughs. That being said this dvd isn't what I had expected. I was hoping for sketches from this time instead it was interviews. I'm not saying they shouldn't have interviews but I would rather see entire sketches and if there were interviews they would be on the extras section.  If you want interviews I guess this would be right down your alley. I just wanted full sketches.,1204934400,24,605,4.260869565217392
3043290,3,B000ZOXDFU,"Obviously the 80's were a rough go for the revolving door of writers, directors and cast members of SNL, this restrospective puts that to the forefront, but leaves you feeling a little sad.
Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy are credited as saving the show from total obscurity and ridicule, retaining rhe praise of their co-cast members as team players and generally talented people. While Jon Lovitz is shown as the only cast member beloved enough to survive one cast literally going up in flames at the end of a season.
The interviews are not complete downers, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is pretty chipper about the experience (obviously she had some success afterwards), Kevin Nealon recalls his time at SNL with great fondness and Victoria Jackson's memories are just fascinating to listen to.
The sad part is watching the footage of the sketches, which were just words being thrown into the air and the audience seemingly laughing at the hope of hearing something funny.
Also Gilbert Gottfried is terribly glum about the situation, with his basic message being ""this was my chance and they set me up to fail"".
There is a light at the end of the tunnel however as 1989 leads into the promise of the 1990's and true comedy to come, but of course we aren't treated to that footage.
If you're looking for a perspective from movie star cast members like Robert Downey Jr., Joan Cusack, Anthony Michael-Hall or Eddie Murphy, you won't find it here.
But if you want a reason to appreciate the magic of the original cast or the joy that was the 1990's, by seeing just how bad it could be and was, then buy this DVD.",1204761600,22,1601,4.680851063829787

3043295,5,B000ZOXDFU,"This is a fascinating light history lesson if SNL 80-89, that is well edited to tell a story of ups/ downs & the legacy of writing talent vis a vis performers, be they new, young or whatnot. Alot of great detailed stories are highlighted with footage of the specific sketch where some unique incident took place, like a toupee  malfunction or unscripted laughter. Most of the names are quite familiar, ( despite the variety of experiences). Some found overwhelming challenges & negative critics, others saw a golden age. Having watched the 70's cast, I was glad to see the 80's get their due, because frankly I find the 70's cast overrated and far from timeless. Not that the early 80's was gold, but the Lovitz Hartman Carvey Jackson Nealon era, soon to include Chris Rock, Farley etc etc was the REAL golden age in my book yet it was hard earned on the backs of people like Murphy, Piscapo, plus Ebersol, Conan, Dreyfuss etc: ALOT of unsung heroes kept that show afloat season after season, (thankfully!)
  The most critcally insightful speaker is Lorne Michael himself, who pulls no punches about the shortcomings and is quite candid and diplomatic about ""putting new wine in the old bottle"" throughout that decade. Amid some powerfully epic funny moments (like Francis Ford Coppola's SNL, wherein Coppola interrupts the live intro and then coaches the audience how to find a place inside from their childhood that produces a laughing reaction so there will be laughter when the host tells the same story again!)

8236235,4,B000ZOXDFU,"""Saturday Night Live"" was about to suffer what was an almost inevitable demise after the brief and disastrous season between 1980 and 1981.  This was all due to the exit of Lorne Michaels (who was the show's principal creative nucleus throughout the first five years) and Jean Doumanian's apparent ineptitude as the former's replacement.  It's obvious to many of us that the vehicle would avert such a fate since ""Saturday Night Live"" is still (after all) functional at 40 years but ""Lost And Found"" documents its survival despite the show's alleged struggles after a near extinction.  It's a shame that the first half of the 80's is in many respects unfairly maligned but the quality of ""S.N.L."" improved thanks to the supervision of Dick Ebersol who (with the assistance of Bob Tischler) eliminated much of the characteristic detriments which riddled Doumanian's brief reign. ""Lost And Found"" also rewards Ebersol his due by his decision to emphasize a young Eddie Murphy (who was so impressive that he could easily hold a candle to his predecessors) as well as Joe Piscopo (who if nothing else was an exceptional impressionist) in an effort to sustain the interest of the audience.  The departures of Murphy and Piscopo left center stage vacant but Ebersol's sensibilities prevailed again when recruiting Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest as well as Martin Short to occupy that same area for his final season at the helm (which in turn was the recipient of widespread critical praise).  Such details are intrinsic to the show's history which is why ""Lost And Found"" is essential to those with a fanatical admiration for ""Saturday Night Live."" Lorne Michaels inevitably appears to lend insight regarding his return and subsequent triumph but is also candid when discussing drawbacks which tainted a once flawless professional reputation (such as the year between 1985 and 1986 in which he found himself in a predicament similar to that of Doumanian's).",1431561600,,1953,5.109717868338558
8236236,5,B000ZOXDFU,Another in depth behind the scenes look at SNL during the 1980s. Just as SNL the first five years gave the history of the birth and early years of the show. This version looks at how the show struggled with following in the footsteps of the original cast. In the early part of the decade as well as the departure of show creator Lorne Michaels. The rise of Eddie Murphy from young featured player to becoming the show's break out star. Also the down years of the mid 80s when the show was mediocre at best. To Michaels return and the shows resurgence towards the end of the decade.  All in all a good get for any fan of SNL.,1431388800,,624,4.2

8236238,4,B000ZOXDFU,"Since the 45 Anniversary special I have been thinking about the older years of SNL, particularly season 10. 1984/1985 was the first year I started watching, and I have fond memories of Martin Short, Billy Crystal, Rich Hall, et.al. For that reason, I was excited to learn of this ""Lost & Found"" special. It is quite well-done, offering a pretty thorough look at each season from the cast and crews involved. It's really interesting to hear about the train wreck of seasons six and eleven (unfortunately I remember the latter), and how they righted the ship with Eddie Murphy, and later with Dana Carvey and crew. However, the period I really wanted to learn more about was season 10, and it had some cool insight from Short, Crystal, Julia Louise-Dreyfuss, Gary Kroeger, Mary Gross, and producer Dick Ebersol. I would have given this video five stars if it included even more from that all-star season... the brilliant Rich Hall, in particular, doesn't even get a mention. That said, I look forward to watching the special again. It weaves interesting music guests and some memorable sketches into the narrative, and it was great to see what the cast members look like today. One of the writers from my beloved season 10 mentions that the show is never as good as you remember when you were in high school, and that's pretty accurate (except for that painful season 11)!",1427155200,,1370,4.784810126582278
8236239,4,B000ZOXDFU,"This is a well put together documentary that covers the 1980s pretty comprehensively.  There are interviews with most of the major players: Lorne Michaels, Dick Ebersol, Dana Carvey, Billy Crystal, Kevin Nealon, Martin Short, Julia Louis-Dreyfous....  Missing some folks like Dennis Miller, Eddie Murphy, Christopher Guest.  There are great excerpts of clips and some backstage photos I'd never seen before.  The infamous Charlie Rocket ""f-bomb"" is shown (though still bleeped.)

One annoying aspect is the musical guests.  They throw in musical guests in a very corny ""Behind the Music"" way.  If the cast is feeling a lot of ""pressure"" in 1980, they will throw in a clip of Queen singing ""Under Pressure"" in 1982.  If Dick Ebersol is said to be protecting them from NBC brass in 1983, they cut to a clip of ""Shelter"" by Lone Justice from maybe 1987.  It's completely contrived and takes you away from the ""feel"" of the time period being covered.  I also would have liked to see some discussion of the bands featured: how they were chosen, some stories behind some of the appearances, which ones were the greatest.

The other complaint I have is that the DVD's title is misleading.  ""Lost and Found"" kind of implies you'll see great full sketches.  Nope.  This is just a little documentary.  I did not mind as I enjoy the behind the scenes looks and discussions, but definitely misleading.

Enjoyable program.  What was amazing was just how awful the early 80s was (aside from Murphy and the Crystal/Guest year) and then how strong it became in the late 80s with Hartman, Carvey, Lovitz, etc.

They should really make these full episodes available to watch on Hulu or Netflix.  I think aside from the 60 minute edited versions that aired on Comedy Central back in the early 90's, some of these have not been shown since they aired live.  Even the ""bad"" years had great musical guests that would be enjoyable to see.",1425513600,2,1915,4.815950920245399
