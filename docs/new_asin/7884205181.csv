8658841,4,7884205181,"This video provides a good overview of the Mt. Huangshan (Yellow Mountain) area of China over a 40+ minute span. It provides commentary in Chinese or English with subtitles. These subtitles are useful since the pronunciations of the speaker are not always clear (hence just four stars).  The video logically progresses around the region and gives you a good sense of what the place is like, the better seasons to visit, etc.  The cinematography is good so you can see how beautiful the place is. While this is not the definitive video of the region, it is worth seeing if you want to know more about this iconic landscape or plan to visit the region in the near future.

While produced in China, this DVD plays just fine on my machine in the US.",1368576000,,745,4.544776119402985
