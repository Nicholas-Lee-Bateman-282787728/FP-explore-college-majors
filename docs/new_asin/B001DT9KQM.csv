8294805,3,B001DT9KQM,"A film which has Dharmedra as the biggest name in the credits. The second biggest is perhaps Shankar Ehsaan Loy, who are favorite composers for big banners these days. They have done a neat job here as well.

The film is classic thriller by all standards. Be it acting, script, direction... anything.

Technically the film is a jewel. Cinematography is top notch. Editing is crisp, narrative fast paced. There is hardly a dull moment. Background score is racy and innovative. Sriram Raghvan proves that the promise shown in his directorial debut was not fluke. He is a director to look out for. And thanks to him, we now have an actor too to look out for in Neil Nitin Mukesh.

So, some may call Johnny Gaddar a cult classic, some call it style exemplified. But in simple terms, it's a good film. Go and watch it.",1304640000,2,813,4.554794520547945
