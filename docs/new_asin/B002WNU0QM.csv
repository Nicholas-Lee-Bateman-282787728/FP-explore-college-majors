4007165,4,B002WNU0QM,"I thought that Prince & Me 4 was much better than 3. It was fun to see the couple  again and the choice for the setting of the movie was beautiful. It of course had its redeming qualities, however it was just a light hearted movie easy,  to watch.",1283040000,,247,4.020408163265306
4007166,5,B002WNU0QM,"I love all four of the Prince and Me movies. Each showing our modern day Cinderella in the trials and tribulations that it takes to live happily ever after after the I DO'S.  Its the one year anniversery for Paige Morgan and Prince Edward and they find themselves spending it in their own Jungle book type adventure.  Something you mind think to find in Indiana Jones films. Paige is now balancing her time as Queen with that of her work as a doctor. That doesn't stop both them from a anniversery trip to Asia even though they each have their own reasons for the trip.  For Edward its to convince the King to accept Denmark's aid while for the queen it to bring her doctor skills to the needed.  As they get ready to attend a royal wedding; however, as like Aladdin falling for the princess in his own story the stable boy has fallen in love with the princess and it up to the royal couple to make the king open his eyes and heart to the sight of true love.  The princess' wicked fiance who believe the common people are slime to make the royals more rich doesn't plan to let his plans ruin and frame the stable boy to get him out of the way. The question of loyalty is brought up as the king's army is sent out by the fiance to stop Edward and Paige from returning the missing elephant and freeing the boy and prevent a enviromental disaster.  In the exotic Asian lands and music makes this stand out among the prince and Me movies as one of the best of the series.",1275696000,12,1467,4.240143369175628
4007167,4,B002WNU0QM,"Queen Paige and King Eddie return!  This time with better script, filming, acting and great location shooting in Asian.  Noted, the last two installments were a tad lame; the first movie is the best, but this one is second, and much more entertaining.  It's still lightweight fare and dialogue, by in large, but there's more adventure and thrills here, but still with the emphasis on the love affair between the two main characters.

By invitation to a wedding, the Danish royal couple zoom off to jungles and elephants and discover a princess not so willing to marry and in love with a poor commoner. Paige to the rescue as she urges Eddy to intervene.  There's intrigue and a trek through the rainforest on an elephant search while being chased by soldiers.

They put money into the sets and outdoor shots.  Our little girls(3&6) think Paige(Kam Heskin) is Barbie on an adventure, and like her many different and beautiful outfits and of course, the elephants.

Also, we kept them from watching the more scary parts, e.g., when the heroes get captured by men waving guns who then tie up and gagged them- more appropriate for pre-adolescent and older.  But overall, it's still very tame: no cussing, nudity, sex- lots of pecks by King and Queen to show their undying love.

If you never cared for any part of this series, you'll still find this one boring, but prettier.  If you're a fan wishing for more and better, you'll love this one.",1273708800,2,1439,4.716
4007168,4,B002WNU0QM,"Paige and Eddie celebrate their 1st year anniversary .

Pros-The lead actors come into their roles as Paige, Eddie & Zorran.
  Solid Plot(More Humor)(Action Scenes)  ( Zorran get's a love interest ).
  Exotic Locations. Film includes extra bonuses.. Behind the scenes, the making of.

Cons- The actor playing the bad guy is terrible .

4007169,5,B002WNU0QM,"I haven't been crazy about the past ""Prince and Me"" movies, partly because the acting was weak and they had corny plotlines. I particularly was disappointed with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-and-Me-3-A-Royal-Honeymoon/dp/B001AR012O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince and Me 3: A Royal Honeymoon</a>, so I wasn't sure what to expect with the fourth installment in the series.

Fortunately,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-Me-4-Elephant-Adventure/dp/B002WNU0QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince & Me 4: Elephant Adventure</a>&nbsp;is far superior to its predecessors. I don't what changed - the director and main actors are all the same - but it's an almost entirely different film. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-Me-4-Elephant-Adventure/dp/B002WNU0QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince & Me 4: Elephant Adventure</a>, Edvard, Paige, and Soren go to the Kingdom of Sangyoon to attend a royal wedding. However, en route, they uncover a love affair, lose an elephant, and save a hill tribe. The plot was both action-packed and emotionally engaging - something to satisfy the boys and girls.

Chris Gere (King Edvard) and Kam Heskin (Queen Paige) will never be my favorite actors, but they seem to have really found themselves in this movie. They're funny, energetic, and confident. Ben Miller as Soren has also morphed from a boring government advisor to a comedic sidekick. He easily had some of the best lines in the movie. The new Asian characters, from Princess Myra to the combative Rayen, are also lively and add to the movie.

The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-Me-4-Elephant-Adventure/dp/B002WNU0QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince & Me 4: Elephant Adventure</a>'s production quality is also a lot better. There's no cheap ski cabins and grainy shots of animals as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-and-Me-3-A-Royal-Honeymoon/dp/B001AR012O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince and Me 3: A Royal Honeymoon</a>. For the scenes in Sangyoon (which is loosely based on Burma, but mixes several Southeast Asian cultures), the cast and crew actually went to Thailand. The sets for the palace buildings are impressive, considering that they were probably built from scratch. Best of all were the jungle scenes, filmed in rainforests. The movie also has a lot of animals, including elephants and orangutans.*

Even if you were disappointed with the past ""Prince & Me"" movies, I do suggest you give this one a try. It makes the previous ""Prince & Me"" movies look amateurish. Highly recommended for families and couples who want to watch a romantic comedy, mixed with a bit of adventure.

* There is a brief scene in the movie when Paige rides an elephant. I wanted to make sure viewers are aware that elephants often go through horrible rituals in order to domesticate them. Therefore, if you go to Asia, you should avoid riding elephants and not support such practices. However, despite the DVD box cover, the elephant-riding scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-Me-4-Elephant-Adventure/dp/B002WNU0QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince & Me 4: Elephant Adventure</a>&nbsp;is short - only a few seconds - so I guess the movie directors realized they shouldn't try to promote elephant-riding.",1269388800,46,3493,6.634573304157549

A great capstone to the story that began with a spoiled prince who managed to annoy his lab partner whose dedication to her life's calling to the practice of medicine  he comes to admire and be sparked by her attractive personality, so different from what he had been accustomed to.

4007328,5,B002WNU0QM,"You would think that the Prince and Me series might get a little stale in its fourth installment but this is one of the best of the four! As King Edvard says in the film: there was adventure, exotic location, star-crossed lovers and an elephant! The chemistry between the three main actors from the 3rd film is really evident; the fighting sequence was fun and well choreographed and it was nice to see Zoren's (spelling?) character having a little more fun for a change. The Thailand setting and culture is portrayed beautifully and you will have a blast watching the final sequence.",1368662400,2,584,4.735294117647059

4007386,5,B002WNU0QM,"I'm a sucker for cheesy romantic comedies, they are light weight and funny, perfect for the times when you just don't know what to watch. I fell in love with the first Prince and Me movie, even with the silly name. When I saw there was a second, I grabbed it right away.  I was kind of disappointed that the role of Paige was recast, but as I watched, I enjoyed it. I had no idea there was a third movie, but when I did, I watched it too, naturally.  I thought it was a little on the lame side, but still a cute movie to put when I need something mindless to watch. Then I noticed they had made a fourth movie, and so, I ordered it.

I was expecting something super cheesy and lame, but the action and fighting scenes were great! The colorful costumes and scenery made the movie very enjoyable.  Even my son watched it - ""for the fight scenes"" of coarse!
This one was much better than the third movie and I really enjoyed how the royal couple was helping someone else rather than fighting their own disasters.

Overall, a fun little movie and a must have to complete the series!",1329264000,,1078,4.213592233009709

4007390,5,B002WNU0QM,"My daughter and I have seen all four of the Prince & Me movies.  Each of them were fantastic, yet different in their own way.  The story line was great and the film was full of adventure, comedy and romance.  We loved it!",1313107200,,221,4.093023255813954
4007391,3,B002WNU0QM,"This movie is good clean fun, with spotty acting. Definitely a children's or family film, but nothing profound here. The one thing that sort of bothered me in this movie is that it seems to be of the genre that promotes strong women--which is a good thing--but does so at the expense of its portrayal of men. Most of the men in this movie (with the exception of the ""bad guy"" and, occasionally, the prince) are portrayed as well-intentioned, but bumbling idiots who fortunately have women in their life who are able to rescue them with greater wisdom and/or martial arts ability. So I appreciate the fact that little girls can watch this and see women who can take care of problems--their own and others--competently, but I would have prefered some stronger males as well. This is what brought this movie down from a four star to a three star movie for me.",1313107200,17,856,4.601307189542483

8383223,5,B002WNU0QM,"I was delighted to see that they FINALLY came out with a fourth movie. Jonathan Firth deserves so much more renown than his overrated brother Colin. His portrayal of Soren was so subtle and nuanced I forgot he was playing a character. This was a truly inspiring love story--that even the most sarcastic among us can win the heart of an Oxford-educated black belt psychologist. I was rooting for the two of them from the moment she stepped on screen. Their chemistry is electric, and there were moments of real tension, such as when she saved his life (no spoilers!).  I'm hoping they continue the franchise with a spinoff featuring these two as a dynamic diplomatic duo. Oh yeah, there was something about an elephant and a prince and princess too, but I was mostly concerned with the main characters.",1515715200,,801,4.7214285714285715
