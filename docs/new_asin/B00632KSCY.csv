4934728,5,B00632KSCY,"Reviewing the movies in this set is pointless you know what you are getting. I can say that on Blu Ray disc the image is stunning. Sound is good too but none of these are sonic tour de forces. If you are looking for the smile-box version of How the west was won you will need to purchase the 2 disc set. However if you are like me and simply happy to see this movie in pristine widescreen, you will not be disappointed. Tonally I do not think the Wild Bunch or the Searchers should be with HtWWW but there are a lot of similarities between these films. HtWWW is the beginning of the ""western"" era, the Searchers is kind of the middle and the Wild Bunch is absolutely the end of an era. I'm very pleased to have this as part of my collection.",1349395200,11,741,4.117241379310345

4934743,5,B00632KSCY,"I bought this for the Debbie Reynolds movie ""How the West was Won""... the other two are just a bonus. I watch them when I get into that western movie mood.

4934751,5,B00632KSCY,"Warner gives you three films here of high quality, all with good to great transfers. Right now the set is about 11 bucks with tax. There really is no better triple collection out there for this price. All three films are legendary for different reasons.

The Searchers got an extensive restoration. This film defined a lot about what we love in traditional westerns and at a very high level of expertise. A John Ford masterpiece.

How The West Was Won, here sans its smilebox version--which to me is too distorted for my liking on my 42 inch--is a wonder to behold for its set design and costumes. If nothing else enjoy the production values here. Stunning realization on bluray.

The Wild Bunch could probably be improved, at the least in its bitrate, but it still is a solid presentation. Peckinpah's classic looks very good for its age, and any viewer only knowing the film from DVD will want the upgrade.

The bitrates are overall a but low to average, but the films do not suffer tremendously from this, and most people will just see a hint of softness compared to the highest bitrate restorations on bluray. All in all this is a must buy recommendation for anyone interested in cinema and art of the period.",1464998400,,1213,4.627906976744186

4934756,5,B00632KSCY,"A great value for three great westerns. The only negative is that you don't get the great ""Smilebox"" version of How the West Was Won which simulates the original Cinerama presentation of the film. You have to buy the standalone blu-ray to get that. The transfer is just the normal 2.76:1 (or so) aspect ratio.",1452124800,,309,4.636363636363637

4934778,5,B00632KSCY,"Three of the greatest westerns ever.  The SEARCHERS is my favorite western of all time and it is in about the top five films off all pictures I have ever seen.  Why John Wayne didn't get the best actor oscar is beyond me.  Wayne didn't play the typical John Wayne part in the film.  And, who can forget the opening scene, and the closing scene. The Door Opens going from complete black to Mounument Valley to receive Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and then at the end of the movie the Door Closes on Monument Valleym back to total black, with John Wayne walking out into the desert.  The performance of Hank Warden as the mentally-challenged adult is worth the award of Best Supporting Actor.  Favorite Warden Line:  ""We thank you O' Lord for what we are about to receive.""  Well, what they are about to receive is about two hundred mad as hell Indians in an attack.

The other two films are excellent as well and HOW THE WEST WAS WON has been repaired and refurbished and has had the two bars of the three separate cameras that was part of the original Cinerama process removed.  You can make out the connections once in a while but if you have ever seen the original you are in for a real treat with this Blu-ray treatment.  In fact, all three movies are spectacularly sharp and the sound is great.

The WILD BUNCH is a real shootum-up and about the most shootum-up of just about any western.  Biggest Shootum-up:  The first twenty minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  I forgot, SPR isn't a western.  Great collection and the most perfect copies of them that you will ever be able to get.",1400025600,,1582,4.440972222222222

4934780,5,B00632KSCY,Two of these movies are among my all time favorite westerns.  The Searchers is about my favor John Wayne western it is one of his better acting performances.  His North to Alaska movie Is very comical.  How the West was Won the other movie included in this package is not very good in my life too much Gore too ridiculous to believe,1389916800,2,332,4.32258064516129
4934781,4,B00632KSCY,"The Searchers and The Wild Bunch are two of my favorite westerns so upgrading to blu ray, for better clarity, was a no brainer. Although I would have preferred another western than How The West Was Won the price was right for the other two movies. I have the DVD version of The Searchers and The Wild Bunch and the blu ray version is a little better in color and sharpness. Enough to warrant replacing the DVD is arguable as the quality is marginally better not fantastically better.",1385510400,3,483,4.5

4934785,2,B00632KSCY,"The Searchers not in original letterbox but  1:85:1, HTWWW is in  original Letterbox or 2.35:1 as is TWB. Saddened that The Searchers is not in original letterbox and would not recommend for that reason.",1377907200,5,203,4.9411764705882355
4934786,5,B00632KSCY,"While The Searchers and The Wild Bunch are much darker films than HTWWW, I'm pretty thrilled to have all three on Blu-ray for such a reasonable price. It is three discs, not all 3 movies crammed onto one disc, but the extras from any 2 disc special editions are not included. The Searchers looks spectacular, as well as being one of Wayne's finest performances. The cinematography has always been stunning, but even better here. This is the best that I've ever seen the Wild Bunch as well. But the most improved award goes to HTWWW. While the ""cinerama effect"" is not 100% gone (there is a version that apes the curved screen effect of Cinerama)those awful lines are pretty much invisible now. Not completely, but it doesn't ruin the viewing, as it had on every other version I saw up until now. This movie see-saws between touching and sappy, between historical and fanciful, and some of the dialogue is downright funny in all the wrong places, but I saw this in Cinerama in 1962 and loved it. Of course I was 8 years old, but I've loved it ever since, warts and all. These are definitely worth the upgrade to Blu-ray.",1372636800,12,1119,4.5721393034825875
4934787,5,B00632KSCY,"Here are three landmark Westerns, gathered together in a single package on BD. Each film has a disc all to itself. All three movies come up well on BD, though the sound could have used a little more restorative work.

""The Searchers"" is presented in VistaVision (16x9 - 1:85:1). Colors are very good, though the sync seems to be off in some scenes between the picture and the voice track.

""The Wild Bunch"" is the Widescreen Director's Cut version (16x9 - 2.4.1), and it looks impressive.

""How The West Was Won"" is a Cinerama production presented in Widescreen Letterbox (16x9 - 2:89:1). Most of the 3-panel ""join lines"" of the Cinerama print for HTWWW have been effectively eliminated, though they are noticeable in any shots where the sky dominates the screen. They've also done some work to eliminate the feeling of the picture on the outer panels curving off the screen, though some scenes are beyond help in this respect.

I paid all of $16.99 for this set through amazon. Quite a bargain!

4934788,5,B00632KSCY,"Three of the greatest westerns of all time in Blue-ray!  I feared that they would try to cram all three features onto one disc (like it was once done in the past).  All three were of excellent viewing quality.  And the sound, superb!  In ""How the West Was Won"", the video and sound combined so that it seemed that I was in the pirate cave with Walter Brennan and James Stewart, or on the flatboat roaring uncontrollably down the river, or on the runaway train while George Peppard and Eli Wallach battled it in out on top of the load of logs.  All for less than $12.  I have recommended this to my younger brothers, but they just want to come over and watch it on my screen.
