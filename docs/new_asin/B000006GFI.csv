1194070,5,B000006GFI,"I grew up in Beaufort,S.C.  Pat Conroy taught my older sisters English at Beaufort High before taking this position on the the island. ""The island that time forgot"" as it was known to us. The movie is a true depiction of how the inhabitants of the island were viewed.  Educating them was nothing more than a unwanted mandate by the government.  The movie was more enhanced by the casting of supporting characters than so closely resembled the real characters. Educating the black population was not a priority as I went thru the schools in that district. It is a sad but all too true to life dicpiction of the way education was carried out during that time period. Viewing this film, and having the truth screaming at you makes one aware of the injustices that lasted so long in the south and last still in some aspects of southern communities. Beaufort has always had very clear racial lines. Only in recent years with the influx of people from across this country relocating there are things starting to change. Change comes slow. This movie shows the desparatly needed changes that were too slow in occuring.
The island was later purchased and turned into a resort. Only then was a bridge erected to connect this island to the rest of the world. Many of the inhabitants moved the north side of the island or were relocated. Imagine having lived there, minimally educated, and then relocated in a society where you have no skills or knowledge of how to survive.",1050192000,55,1463,4.684824902723736
1194071,4,B000006GFI,"In his later career, director Martin Ritt was renowned for his realistic treatment of a slice of life. He achieved a glimmering one in this hidden gem adapted from author Pat Conroy's novel, ""The Water Is Wide."" Its movie version, retitled ""Conrack,"" has the amazing Jon Voight in the real-life role of teacher that Conroy played for a year on a South Carolina island inhabited by mostly African-Americans living in absolutely poverty and ignorance, and virtually forgotten by the world outside. The illiterate children, unable to pronounce Conroy's name, can do no better than ""Conrack,"" thus, the title. Realizing all too soon that he has the near insurmountable challenge of teaching what school administrators have dismissed as the unteachable, Conrack comes up with the strategy of teaching by applying knowledge to his childrens' everyday lives. His efforts, and the childrens' steadily emerging ability to learn, make for an assortment of human emotions, from frustration to out-and-out howling to the bittersweet of the childrens' recognition and acceptance of their lot in life. But while teaching and learning make progress, school administrators are less than impressed by Conrack's methods, and the film head toward the inevitable clash between teacher and school officials and the resolution, we are lead to conclude, is at the childrens' expense. As Conrack, Voight is both stirring and moving without being phony, and he convinces us that the teacher's only agenda is his pupils' betterment. But the child actors who make up the pupils are incredible! They actually make us believe we are listening to a socially and educationally decimated and totally forgotten other world. The film is all the more powerful with Conroy's novel read beforehand for background. Both the movie and book are a stellar acknowledgement of the perserverance of the human spirit and how much can be achieved in even the most forgotten of our brothers.",1046563200,70,1944,5.254019292604502
1194072,5,B000006GFI,"Having just received this video from Amazon.com,(after many years of searching), I am reminded of what a fantastic movie it was, and what a great impact it left upon me. Being able to share it with others now is a joy.  Conrack's enthusiasm for life was contagious to his extremely sheltered students. The reality based conclusion,though emotionally disappointing, exemplified thetenacity of Conrack's core values. I loved this movie, because I laughed and cried.  Jon Voight rocks!!  This is one of my top ten all time favorite films.",1030492800,24,535,5.126436781609195
1194073,5,B000006GFI,"Wow, I'll write it again: wow. This movie was one of the finest films I've ever seen.  Conrack is undoutedly one of the top ten films I've ever seen, based on script. It is the movie that no doubt begot films like Dead Poets Society.  A hands down top ten inspirational film OF ALL TIME. That's right, this film is like one of those sweet smelling aromas you used to sniff right before your mother exclaimed, ""DINNER!""
John Voight is extremely believable as a dream-big teacher in the late sixties.  He takes a job on an island, becoming the only white man on the whole piece of land.  He uses a number of unconventional methods to teach his otherwise completely uneducated class. Soon, though, as is the case with many of these type of films, the powers that be put their foot down and we witness....well, you'll just have to see.
This is a heart-warming, tear-jerking film that will make even the biggest macho men sniffle from a few tears. A true film for the fan on hidden gems. In the case of Conrack, this is purely movie magic.",1029542400,38,1034,4.455026455026455
1194074,4,B000006GFI,"This is about a teacher called Conroy who goes to educate underpriviledged children on an island. They cannot pronounce his name and so call him 'Conrack'. The children have never had much time invested in them before, and 'Conrack' is the first person who has believed in them. As well as being a method lesson in teaching, it is also a good personal film, and even if you don't warm to Jon Voight's character immediately, you will love the little children.",1013126400,5,458,4.666666666666667
1194075,5,B000006GFI,"I'm a teacher in one the largest black-majority school systems in the country, and I can tell you that this film about a one room schoolhouse in a rural, black poverty area profiles the most effective teaching I've seen in movies of this type.  It's not the typical inner-city high school setting with angry students acting out.  The kids in this film are completely ignorant, yet respectful and adorable.  They have not been taught at all until Pat Conroy comes along. Not only can't these children read, write or even count, but they have no vocabulary or knowledge about the world beyond their island.  Conroy teaches the children a love of learning, and the fact that they CAN learn.  Although his methods are not explained, I surmise that he knows that children will not read unless they're interested first in knowledge itself.  They won't write until they have something to say.  Conroy's techniques were unorthodox in 1969, and are not unlike the strategies of new-teacher-saves-urban-high school-kids-movies.  He engages them with movement, demonstrations, nature hikes, music, a field trip to the white folk's town, and with discussions about history, geography, and most of all, the children's home lives.  The movie is directed and acted in such a natural and authentic way, it seems like a documentary.  ""Conrack"" is a moving and enlightening film.",993859200,24,1361,5.09009009009009
1194076,5,B000006GFI,"Midnight Cowboy, not withstanding, this movie cemented my fondness for Jon Voight. Great in Deliverance, he really sank his teeth into this role and it shows.  Great movie about the south.  As a white teacher at an all-black school on an island off the Carolina coast, he may not have had the ideas that everyone else followed, but his methods were effective none the less.  Watch for Hume Cronyn (Jessica Tandy's husband at the time and until her death, in the unforgiving role of the District's Superintendent. An absolutely poignant and special movie. STUDIO: PLEASE release this movie on DVD!",978134400,13,596,4.94
1194107,5,B000006GFI,I love this story.  The author Pat Conroy tells of his first teaching job.  He is so smart and funny and Jon Voight plays the roll to a T.  A must see for all teachers.  Gives thinking out of the box a whole new meaning.,1394755200,,220,3.8222222222222224

1194110,5,B000006GFI,"Excellent movie about a teacher determined to teach poor southern childern self esteem and self value.  All the other teachers had found these childeren to be illiterate and un-teachable, Conrack proved them wrong.",1365292800,2,214,5.484848484848484

1194112,5,B000006GFI,"When is this going to be released on DVD? The VHS prices are ridiculous.

1194113,5,B000006GFI,Conrack: do not recall much about this movie. Family member ordered it for watching winter months when weather is cold.,1354233600,,119,5.0
1194114,3,B000006GFI,"What could be easily dismissed as another `white man saves black people' movie, `Conrack' should get some slack for being inspired of a true story and yet probably held a little more critically for the very same reason.

I was moved by the film and found it to be entertaining and well performed all the way around (Voight is VERY good) and yet I couldn't help but feel as if this film was so whitewashed it was pathetic.  The lengths gone to make Pat Conroy a hero in the eyes of all seems out of place and, from what I've read by other reviewers, unauthentic.  It makes for an uplifting Hollywood biopic, but I'd prefer to see the truth behind the whitewashing.  I really wanted to see the earthy grit behind it all and not just another portrayal of a beacon of `white' light manifested over the uneducated black folk trying desperately to stay under the radar so-to-speak.

Still, Voight and Madge Sinclair are very good here and the cinematography is stunning.  Sadly, the kids are given little to do and the film seems to have little interest in them (another avenue of whitewashing, since the sole focal point is on Conroy instead of the students he helped).  If you like your standard `teacher/student' dramas then this one will do and you'll certainly enjoy it since most of the technical elements are WAY up to par, but if you want something that feels genuine and unaffected by obvious manipulations then I'd avoid this one.",1347840000,,1434,4.622047244094488

1194137,5,B000006GFI,"Please put this movie on DVD for those of us to want to buy it, and there should be many.  I saw it years ago, and was impressed by the poignant message, and the excellent acting by Jon Voight and others in the film.  Why are so many quality films like this from 25 or 30 years ago just allowed to be forgotten, while so much garbage that is being produced today is touted as something we should spend money for?!  This movie, about a white teacher teaching black students on a little island off S. Carolina sensitively and honestly handles the plot.  There is drama, humor, and most important, a racial message that would be important for us today - or any time.  Please answer the request of those of us who know this film's value, and put it out on DVD! Thanks!",1338768000,,764,4.277777777777778
1194138,5,B000006GFI,"I saw this film in the theatre when it was first released.  It made a powerful impression on me.  Many years have passed, and I couldn't remember the name of the film until I looked up Jon Voight on Wikipedia.  Then I came to Amazon to purchase it, and to say I am extremely disappointed that it's no longer being reproduced is an understatement.  This was one of the finest films of all time, and Jon Voight's portrayal of Pat Conroy was miraculous.  A beautiful and poignant film.",1257465600,3,482,4.431818181818182
1194139,3,B000006GFI,"I was disappointed in this film, though it was entertaining. There was no character development among the children, or in fact very much development of anybody. I had hoped to learn something of Gullah culture from this film, and was left wanting. There is no discussion of who these folks are, of their history, why they live in isolation on an island. This film could have been so much better. As it was, it could have been another Robin Williams film with the misunderstood, altruistic clown with a heart of gold battling the bad old establishment. I'm sure the book is much better. This is superficial, lighthearted entertainment at best.",1252368000,,642,4.845454545454546
1194140,4,B000006GFI,"Having never seen or heard of this movie before tonight, I can honestly say it was wonderful.  I grew up in Pawleys Island, SC and I do not know how I've never heard of this but it really relates to a lot of the issues I had to deal with growing up.  This movie is wonderful and Voight gives a great performance.  As someone said before me, if you ware thinking of giving up on your teaching job, watch this movie.  Although it doesn't relate to affairs today, it is a good movie and I really enjoyed it.  It is a positive influence with all the negative happening in the world today.  I have heard many stories about Pat Conroy and this is a good movie.  Voight also doesn't over-exaggerate the SC southern accent like most movie stars do.  He makes it sound normal and intelligent which we are, and not like stupid hillbillies.",1245888000,2,829,4.337662337662338
1194141,4,B000006GFI,"This film captures life decades ago in the Low Country of South Carolina for black children, whose isolation keeps them both ignorant and sweetly innocent.  The arrival on their island of teacher Pat Conroy, or ""Conrack,"" opens their minds to the wider world of Beethoven, Brahms and celebrating Halloween.

Several aspects of the film seem time capsule-ish:  The Low Country's children's awakened thirst for knowledge and respect for their teacher, a bygone optimism compared to this era of student beatdowns of teachers being posted on Youtube; and Conrack's ability to hug the boys and carry the girls into the surf to teach them to swim, which would lead to a sexual contact lawsuit in today's time.

This makes ""Conrack"" seem not so much dated as our current times jaded. I was surprised at how non-preachy and non-syrupy the film managed to be given the way Hollywood today would amp up the ""message"" of the film.

""Conrack"" is well worth seeking out for its optimistic view of children's capacity to learn, and the star turns taken by the ensemble of young actors interacting with lead Jon Voight in one of his best roles.",1232496000,2,1129,4.859375
1194142,5,B000006GFI,"Having seen this gem in college, in a cinematography class, I will never forget it.  Possibly one of Voigt's best ever.  Compare this character to the part he played in ""Enemy of the State"" and you'll be amazed at the spectrum of his acting skills.  The only thing BAD about this movie is the administrator character who is an evil person.  I think he was played by Hume Cronyn.  But his performance, too, is outstanding.  I saw this just recently on one of the oldies networks like AMC.  And I was able to share it with my family who came to love this move.  DO NOT miss this one.  And why is it not out on DVD?  It was a GREAT social commentary of the time.  Scratch that...it IS a great social commentary of the time.  The acting is more than good, it is pure and very real...by all parties.  I highly recommend CONRACK.",1216684800,5,823,4.266233766233766
1194143,5,B000006GFI,"I was a Peace Corps volunteer high school teacher in Central Africa in the early 1980s, and Conrack comes closer than any film I have seen to capturing that kind of inimitable life-altering experience.  I show the film (VHS only, alas) every year to my first-year college students, many of whom will become teachers themselves, as an inspirational example of how to become your own best resource for imaginative teaching, even in this electronic age.  As I predicted, THEY LOVE IT!!  WHY OH WHY is this film not yet on DVD?  We must start a campaign to pressure the studio to transfer this gem as it deserves.",1189987200,,609,4.663551401869159
1194144,5,B000006GFI,"It is hard to whittle down the best of the best of these tour-de-force performers, but Conrack HAS to be  either 1 or 2 TOPS of Voight's career. Stunning, captivating, stirring, thought-provoking...if I haven't given you enough adjectives, you are not worthy of watching....one of the Best of the best.",1185840000,3,302,5.04
1194145,5,B000006GFI,"Based on Pat Conroy's autobiographical novel ""The Water is Wide"", this seldom-seen film is well deserving of a DVD issue from the only current available VHS release of this 1974 film starring a very young John Voight in the lead role.  Set during the height of the Vietnam War, he plays a teacher sent to a tiny island elementary school, where he finds a group of young black students deemed as ""slow"" by their parents and peers, the principal in charge of the school, and his great nemesis, the school superintendant, brilliantly played by Hume Cronyn, who ultimately fires him for his insubordination in teaching the kids too well.  Definitely one of Voight's greatest roles ever, this beautiful film should not be missed.",1176681600,5,724,4.878048780487805

What Pat Conroy undertook to educate the disenfranchised and forgotten black children on a small island a stone's throw from the white elite cities of Beaufort,Savannah and Charleston will amaze and astound. Jon Voight captures the screen with his performance as the ""against-all-odds"" teacher Pat Conroy (later author of PRINCE OF TIDES).What I find still sad at the time of this review is that similar conditions in educational racial lines still exist (and I am a Northerner!)The only knock with this film is the director Martin Ritt's choice of using some of the white Beaufort townsfolk for very minor roles. They are perfectly stiff and downright laughable!!!!Other than that,this film should not be missed by anyone.",1169683200,7,1027,5.385093167701863

1194172,5,B000006GFI,"This story has such a wonderful message.  The movie is acted so beautifully.  It has so much sweetness, some laughs, and many special moments.  Since I first saw this movie as a child, it has been my very favorite movie of all time.  The sweetness he, as a teacher, shows his students, and the respect and love they return are so dear.  The message of giving all children the best education possible, the most experiences to broaden their horizons, and even making education fun are still appropriate today.

He is a teacher on a very poor island in the south.  His students have never been off the island.  They have had very limited education and the principal of the school feels these kids won't amount to much.  As the new teacher, he does all he can to make the kids feel they are all important, he makes learning fun, he tells them about the world off the island, and even takes them on field trips off the island.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  I have seen it many times, and look forward to getting it on DVD so I can watch it again with a clear picture (my VHS tape is wearing out, I've watched it so much).

This is a great movie for the entire family.  It opens up doors for great topics of conversation, including being yourself and standing up for what you belive in.  You just can't go wrong with this movie!",1145404800,12,1325,4.355102040816327

1194174,5,B000006GFI,"Based on a true story (THE RIVER IS WIDE, Pat Conroy). Jon Voight plays a young schoolteacher who goes to an island off the coast of South Carolina and confronts poverty and ignorance. He brings a fresh style and approach to education to his all black classroom, and soon has the kids eagerly learning and gaining some self-respect. It all goes down the tubes, though, when he crosses with the redneck superintendent over a Halloween outing, and he gets fired.

Voight is excellent as the teacher (the ""-roy"" in his name comes out ""-rack"" in the island's dialect, thus the title), and watching him go through his paces is uplifting. The good vs. evil theme can be overly blatant at times, and Voight's driving a van with loudspeakers attached as he admonishes the town (Beaufort) for firing him is over-the-top sentimentality (as is the ending with all the kids lined up on the deck to see him go, as expected as it might be), but the movie is effective and strong most of the time.

It is about hope and love and equality. It is about the magic of learning and the power of teaching. It`s about all the things we are supposed, as a country, to have given up on and rushed, headlong into consumerism. If that is where you are, and you think anyone foolish that thinks otherwise, this is not the film for you. If you hold out hope for the human race, and see promise in the eyes of those who would be more than they are, and those who would see them achieve that goal, you will have a wonderous experience here. It is a celebration of those who would share knowledge, and the joy of those who discover the joy of learning. Jon Voight has never had a more powerful vehicle, and his fellow cast members make this a film once seen, never forgotten. In this story of a teacher reaching out to the most forgotten piece of society, you will find all the hope your heart may need. It ends sadly, but, that is part of the hurt of hope. And part of the nobility of it.",1086825600,13,1125,4.113636363636363
1194178,2,B000006GFI,"As a kid growing up in the state of SC, when the film was released, my friends and family kept wondering who was going to become famous. The racist and segregated South was not entirely depicted in the movie. For the rest of America, believe me...it did't even touch the surface. Education and educational funding didn't exist for the segregated 'Black' schools in the lowcountry of South Carolina. For instance, the first time I ever knew about Chemistry or Chemistry labs was when I was a student at Clemson University. Yes, Clemson ! I was a trend setter, to say the least. Putting all the hatred and inhumanities aside, I love the low country and where I came from. There's nothing like crabbing on a early saturday morning along the marshes and black water rivers of the ACE basin and enjoying the fruits of your harvest (with a cold beverage of your choice, indeed!). The film, for me, summarized and gave the rest of the world a smidgen of life in the south as a descendent of former slaves. I LOVE 'Conrack' and I appreciate Pat Conroy. Pat Conroy IS ""Good People"", as we say in Dixie. So buy the movie, enjoy the movie...and then go visit the SC lowcountry barrier islands.
