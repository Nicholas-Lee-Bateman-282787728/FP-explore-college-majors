The scene where they keep shooting Chris over and over again(he's a vampire) made me laugh until my chest hurt!  There's also some great dialog.  Their other works, such as Journeyquest and The Gamers, are brilliant as well.  Just remember the wisdom inherent in Romans 14:2!",1398729600,,444,4.714285714285714
8249509,5,B00139VW72,"I've been a fan of Dead Gentlemen Productions for years since I first watched The Gamers. These are their first two films, Demon Hunters and Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake combined onto one DVD. Small budget, independently made campus movies that started a fantastic set of videos. Duamerthrax, the Indestructible is a likeable Earthwalking demon set to slay from the left or right with equal glee to escape the Pacific Lutheran University campus. Also, if you love these movies, check out Gamers, Gamers: Dorkness Rising, Gamers: Hand of Fate and JourneyQuest!",1367366400,,562,5.186813186813187
8249510,5,B00139VW72,"Ok, so I went to Pacific Lutheran University where Demon Hunters was made. I was there when they had the Premier showing of it. I even have one of the original VHS tapes of it they sold after the show.

Great film, hillariously funny. The Demon Duarmothrax steals the show and makes fun of campus life, by eating both the liberals and conservatives the ""equal opportunity killer"" as he puts it.

Its definitly campy, and some of the humor is specific to the PLU campus. But anyone whoes gone to college can appreciate most of the humor.

Bottom line, this is comedy. Its not dark and gothy, or particularly violent. the fighting in it is very obviouly not real, but done well in a way to convey hummor, and I didn't find it cheesy at all.

I give it 5 stars in comparison to other college movies. Top notch for its  playing field.",1323820800,,830,4.398692810457517
8249511,5,B00139VW72,I loved it. I wish my college years were like this. And I thought the end of the movie was brilliant,1314057600,,100,3.8095238095238093
8249512,5,B00139VW72,"We have the first films from the group known as Dead Gentlemen Productions. They would go on to make the films Gamers and Gamers: Dorkness Rising. This DVD includes actually 2 films. The first is Demon Hunters, the story of Chris a college slacker whose life is turned completely upside down when the demon Duamerthrax is released after a 1,000 year imprisonment and wreaks havoc on his college campus. Chris (played by Steve Wolbrecht) is saved (sort of) by the Demon Hunters a team of demon and monster killers lead by Gabriel (played by Nathan Rice) and featuring Don Early as Silent Jim (no relation to Kevin Smith's Silent Bob). The movie is very funny and very low budget (they were in college when it was made). The sequel is Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake which follows Gabriel and Chris after their epic battle with Duamerthrax looking for a safe house to rest and recuperate but darkness is rising again. Both films were filmed on micro budgets and were done very well. They are very funny and if you are a fan of independent films (like I am) then you will enjoy it.",1292371200,2,1078,4.590673575129534
