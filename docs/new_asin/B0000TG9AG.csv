1943804,5,B0000TG9AG,"My son loves this DVD.  It has turned him into a Polie Fan for sure.  He loves to watch it right before he goes to bed.  It is one of his favorites and asks for it daily.  It is a typical child's movie and keeps him occupied for hours at a time.  The only drawback is that it is not really long enough - definitely not movie format and there is no repeat play, urgh!!!",1082419200,3,368,3.8533333333333335
1943805,3,B0000TG9AG,"This DVD is cute, but it is not a full length movie.  It constantly puts you back to the menu and has a ton of previews, which can be irritating if your little one is excited about watching!!  Just not one of my daughter's favorites and she is crazy about Rolie Polie Olie.",1080518400,6,273,4.132075471698113

1943810,3,B0000TG9AG,During several of the sceens you see the uncles butt crack :( I don't know why they had to put that in there. Luckily my 2 yr old son and my 3 yr old daughter didn't notice or say anything about it. We like olie but this one made me very disappointed.,1441670400,,251,3.8461538461538463
1943811,5,B0000TG9AG,Such a cute movie! we have always loved Olie! This one was super cute because we where able to watch spring time and an special valentines day one. It was a double dvd for the price of just one :) we are so pleased with it!,1441670400,,223,3.869565217391304
1943812,1,B0000TG9AG,"I loved Rolie Polie Olie as a child and was so excited to share it with my own children. However this DVD has very poor picture quality and the menu is completely impractical. There are long narratives that you MUST listen to before selecting any options. There is no pushing the ""menu"" button on your remote to bypass this option. What a waste. This DVD will most likely sit in our collection and never get watched.",1440201600,2,416,4.4868421052631575

1943819,3,B0000TG9AG,When I got this delivery I noticed I could hear the movie bouncing around before I even opened it. The case was crushed but when I opened it the movie was thankfully fine no scratches. They would get more stars if they could possibly find a better way to package. So there's not a chance for it to break now I don't have a case for the movie.,1425686400,,342,4.044117647058823

1943830,5,B0000TG9AG,"I bought this DVD for my nephew and he really seems to enjoy it.  I have witnessed him watching this on a loop several times, so it must be pretty good to a four year old.  So long as it keeps the kids quiet and sedated, I'm cool with that!",1378425600,,240,3.78

1943833,5,B0000TG9AG,Thank you movie mars for delivery another satisfying order. I love these movies they are so cute and no longer show them on Disney Jr.[which I don't understand why]. My son is named rollan and so I thought it would be cute to get him into the cartoon his new nickname is rolie,1367452800,,276,4.226415094339623
1943834,5,B0000TG9AG,"This has lots of episodes on it, which is great.  A little annoying that you have to keep clicking okay, okay, okay before getting to any of the shows, though.  A quick-start format would've been nice.",1356652800,,201,4.555555555555555

1943837,5,B0000TG9AG,"Excellent DVD TV show based of a popular Children's Story, about a robot family the ""Olie""s. The Olies live in a tea pot (with Grampa living in a tugboat out back)The show is all about the ""Olies"" and their friends.
Halloween Episode is priceless.
My 7 month old son adores Rolie and his little sister Zowie.",1285372800,,308,4.517857142857143
1943838,5,B0000TG9AG,"My wife bought a couple books at a yard sale and my 2 year old daughter constantly wanted us to read these books to her over and over again. So this lead me to find out a little bit more about Disney's Rolie Polie Olie. Well, I found that this show was discountinued and Disney did not carry the VHS or DVD's anymore. So I did a search here on Amazon and lo and behold, there they were. I wound up ordering a few of the DVD's in Used condition and they all arrived perfectly. You could not even tell that they were used, cases were in very nice condition and the DVD's were not smeared or scratched. My daughter loves the videos and they are played constantly on the big TV or on a little one in the other room when Mommy and Daddy want to watch their shows.",1279584000,,758,4.06
1943839,5,B0000TG9AG,Gift for nephew who loves Rolie Polie Olie.  Fast service. Arrived in no time.  Will continue to use Amazon!,1261353600,,108,4.631578947368421
1943840,1,B0000TG9AG,"I have an issue with both of my purchases that I require a reply to.  Neither DVD will play in any of the three DVD players I have at home nor will they play in our portable DVD player.

I would like to return these DVD's for a refund but I don't know how to do this.  If someone could get in touch with me I would appreciate it.

I don't know what the problem is maybe it's becasue Im in Australia and not the US but the DVD'd are of no use to me if they won't play.

Thank you

1943841,3,B0000TG9AG,"Ditto for me on what others have said about the menu options for the DVD.  It's a total waste of time for parents of young children who can't use a DVD remote yet.  Instead of being able to navigate through menu options on your own, you have to wait while there is useless narration and for the option you want to be selected.  And if you don't select your option fast enough, you have to wait until all the narration and selections are over.  Very annoying!!",1201651200,2,459,4.3023255813953485
1943842,5,B0000TG9AG,"This DVD is not a Disney DVD so I was a little nervous about purchasing. To my delight, it is perfect for my little Zowie who loves Rolie Polie Olie. We wished there were collections available. My Zowie loves seeing her ""alter-ego"" on screen as a soupy hero. It does not have special features or games, just a few priceless episodes. The nice thing about it is that it plays automatically after 10 seconds. I can pop it in the car dvd player and it replays for her without needing a remote!",1194566400,,490,4.336956521739131
1943843,3,B0000TG9AG,"All the things the other reviewers say about the DVD navigation are true.  On top of that, you sometimes cannot scroll around on the menu.  Instead you have to wait for the highlight to move around and hit enter when it's on your selection.  What a complete waste of parents' time!  FYI, this is a collection of mini episodes.  Before you realize one episode is over, you're into the next, so portion control to kids is also difficult.  Disney, this is inexcusable!!  4.5 stars for content, 1 star for usability.",1147478400,8,512,4.622222222222222
1943844,5,B0000TG9AG,My daughter just loves the springy chicken!  We watch this all the time and she just goes nuts and finds it fun,1133049600,,111,4.045454545454546
1943845,5,B0000TG9AG,"I gave this DVD 5 stars because the Rolie Polie stories contained on it are wonderful:  funny, clever, visually intriguing, containing wholesome (but not cloying) morals, something that parents and kids can enjoy together.  One set of shorts is devoted to Valentine's Day, one to a nondenominational version of a springtime holiday.  It's a shame this series isn't more widely known and appreciated. My 3 yr old twins and my 7 yr old happily watch this DVD together.

The major criticism is the way the DVD is packaged by Disney. I've never come across a more annoying, counterintuitive set of menus.  You first are automatically subjected to previews of the umpteenth Disney latest release, and you must opt out of the previews by clicking on an exit function.  Similarly, there is no ""play all"" function readily available; you have to individually select which of the sets of shorts you want to watch, then select play in a separate menu for that set.  Worst of all, you have to listen to some irritating narrator blather on about what you're trying to watch and no matter how you try to make your selection, you can't until a certain amount of blather has elapsed. My clever 3 yr old has figured out how to keep pressing play in just the right way to expedite the process, but it's horribly annoying and makes me loathe the Disney juggernaut even more.",1104192000,12,1355,4.716101694915254
