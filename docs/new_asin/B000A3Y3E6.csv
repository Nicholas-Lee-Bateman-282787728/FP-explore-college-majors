8074383,3,B000A3Y3E6,"This is a very simplistic introduction to editing. It is more informative than a hands-on or how to DVD.

You will first be introduced to the kind of hardware you will need to edit your movies. Obviously, you are asked to purchase a computer with a very fast processor and lots of RAM and hard disk space. But you are not given any guidelines to the type of hardware most suitable: basically, just get the fastest and best that's out there. This is good advice regardless of the programs you want to run on your computer, but not necessarily very practical to the majority of us.

You will then be introduced to different techniques you can use to edit your movies. For example, you can turn your movies into black and white; add grains to them to make them look real old, and even slow down the scenes (slow motion). You can also add titles and animation to your scenes, and produce really unique transitions between your scenes. Different software can do that, but you are not shown specific steps of how this is done. You might be using different software than the presenter in this DVD. Basically, examples of what you can do are given, but not how to do them!

Scenes from a 1941 Steven Spielberg movie and scenes from JAWS are used as examples of how transitions work and how scenes can be shaped by adding music. The presenter urges you to watch movies and see how the professionals do it! Again, you are told what you can do, but not how to do it!

I think that what you will get most out of this video is how powerful software can be in shaping your movie. Buy a state of the art computer and professional software and you can make really great movies. But then everybody knows that!",1189382400,,1692,4.413461538461538
8074384,1,B000A3Y3E6,"The video is a waste of time.  Using an ""instructional video"" template from the 80s, the movie presents ""advanced video editing"" as a quick ""how to"" for simple and basic video effects that anyone can learn on their own.  The experts who are knowledgeable, but there simply isn't much presented.  What is there is simplistic, presented without  much explanation and overly simplified.  What you do get are systematic breaks with a 10 second countdown/time-waster stuck in between that help meet the total time length of thirty minutes.  Don't spend your money on this unless $5.00 or less.",1171843200,2,588,5.010309278350515
