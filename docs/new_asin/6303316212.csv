630366,4,6303316212,"As biker movies go, Chrome And Hot Leather is unusual. Biker films, tended to highlight the wild lifestyle of the outlaw biker culture, as desirable. But this film doesn't glorify bikers. In fact, the military establishment, and their straight-arrow values, are the focus of heroism in this movie.

It's true that by the time this film was made in 1971, outlaw bikers were no longer romanticized like they had been just a few years earlier, by the youth culture. Still, it's hard to believe that during the Vietnam war era, when antiwar sentiments were strong, Hollywood goes and makes a film with the military as the good guys.

The plot centers around a Green Beret Sgt. named Mitch, who is headed home after his tour of duty in 'Nam. He's engaged to be married to a beautiful young woman, and ready to begin a new life as a civilian. Meanwhile, as his fianc and her friend are out for a drive, they're harassed by a biker gang. This results in an accident, that kills the two women. Mitch, along with a few of his army comrades, are determined to catch the bikers who are responsible for killing his fianc.

Actor Tony Young infuses the character of Mitch with a steely, square-jawed resolve, to avenge his fianc's murder. The great R&B singer Marvin Gaye, appears as Mitch's Green Beret buddy. Marvin does an adequate job in his role, but he's a much better singer than actor. William Smith plays the biker gang leader. William has appeared in more biker films over the years, than probably any other actor. With his burly, threatening appearance, Smith seems like he was born to play badass outlaw bikers.

Mitch and his Army pals work together as a cracker-jack military unit, to accomplish their mission of nabbing the biker gang. The way Mitch and company carry out their quest for justice, reminds me of the fictional TV military group, called the A-Team. I wonder if the creators of the A-Team, were inspired by this movie.

Chrome And Hot Leather isn't the best biker film around, but it's different. For fans of biker movies, this one won't validate the bikers as cool. This movie would be most enjoyable for those that admire the military, and how it's members triumph over the bad guys.",1261872000,5,2200,4.689119170984456

630368,3,6303316212,"I first saw ""Chrome And Hot Leather"" in 1985. I enjoy the film mainly for the bikes. There are a couple of scenes that really show off the bikes,one in particular when Marvin Gaye rides up to a few guys sitting on a warehouse deck,enjoying a few beers. The bikes in that scene are beautiful. If your like me and into Harleys and nostalgia this film captures a little bit of that from 1971. Unfortunately the ""Mini Skirt Mob"" does nothing for me. Some beautiful ladies in the film though!",1205020800,2,487,4.4222222222222225
630369,2,6303316212,"Since someone has already reviewed ""The Miniskirt Mob"" I'll comment about the other biker film in this DVD package, the best things being that both are very good prints,  both are in widescreen, and both feature some very beautiful actresses.

The saddest thing about ""Chrome and Hot Leather"" (1971) is that it could have been a fairly decent film; at least by American International biker film standards. They seem to have had a large budget; at least enough to cast in quantity if not quality; and to outfit their biker gang (Wizards) with Harley's-something that was often beyond the budget of these things.

They had William Smith, the best movie baddie of the day, for their gang leader T.J. and Michael Haynes for the chain-throwing mama slapping Casey. In fact the whole biker thing is handled pretty well by the standards of the early 1970's.  As are the stunts and most of the action sequences.

Then they had an extremely young Cheryl Ladd (she looks about 16 although she was 18) and former Miss Ohio and Miss America Runner-Up Kathy Baumann (note the John Havlicek Basketball Camp t-shirt she is wearing). In high school she dated someone I knew and she looks about the same in this film as she did then. Unfortunately neither actress gets to show much in the way of acting skills or exploitable assets. .

This is one of those movies the Army and Air Force Exchange Service saw fit to show us GI's at posts and bases around with world back in the early 1970's. To us at the time virtually everything military related was unintentionally hilarious, from Peter Brown's non-GI haircut (if it was a paying role couldn't he at least have cut it enough so you could see a portion of his ears) to the moronic combat training. It got laughs from us for months whenever someone brought up the topic. On the other hand what was supposed to be the film's comic relief, sequences of Peter Brown and Company learning to ride motorcycles is funny only to those amused by things totally lame and stupid.

In retrospect the film never had a chance given its director Lee ""The Man With Two Heads"" Frost and its star, the aging Tony Young. When you look bad in comparison to a non-actor (Marvin Gaye plays Tony's pal) it is time to find another line of work. Young lined up the financing for this baby and hired Frost on the condition he be given the lead. You won't find a more wooden actor than Young, whose character looks like an extremely dour 55 year-old man and is supposed to be the love interest for the two teen actresses.

Several times they appear headed in the self-parody direction (if that is what they had emphasized the film would be a classic) and Smith lets you know that he is playing this thing for laughs. But this tiny attempt at real humor is dwarfed by the unintentional hilarity and the giggles you will get from the many continuity errors that occur throughout the movie.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1204416000,3,2940,4.574144486692015

630371,3,6303316212,"""The Mini-Skirt Mob"" is no classic, but it delivers enough action to make it worthwhile. Diane McBain stars as the leader of a female motorcycle gang (hence the title) who is determined to punish the guy who jilted her. With the aid of her companions, including biker film veteran Jeremy Slate and future cult actor Harry Dean Stanton, she proceeds to harass both her ex-boyfriend (Ross Hagen) and his mousy new bride (Sherry Jackson). Along for the ride, and good in a sympathetic role, is ex-child star Patty McCormack, as McBain's little sister. The photography is excellent as is the color, and the movie doesn't take forever to make it's point. McBain is terrific as ""Shayne"". Very watchable.

630751,3,6303316212,"A vindictive woman, is the motivating force in The Mini-Skirt Mob (1968), an AIP production that features some mentally challenged characters, involved in a series of confrontations that become increasingly more violent.  The acting is generally poor, and the dialog often appalling, but the rather clichd plot does feature enough mean spirited action and hits of sleaze, to be mildly entertaining, to those seeking some late 60's trashiness.

Jeff Logan (Ross Hagen) is an ex-rodeo star who has just gotten hitched.  Unfortunately, instead of wishing him well, his old flame Shayne (Diane McBain), the leader of a female biker gang, is bent on making his life a misery.  Under Shayne's prodding, some of Logan's former co-workers beat him up, while Shayne slaps his new bride Connie (Sherry Jackson) silly.  Only when Logan brandishes his rifle, is further violence temporarily averted.

The Logan's hit the road, towing a mobile home, but Shayne and a small group that includes Lon (Jeremy Slate), Spook (Harry Dean Stanton), and Shayne's sister Edie (Patti McCormick), catch up to the couple, and begin harassing them.  Logan is unaware, but in during the incident, one of the gang is accidentally run off the road and killed.  This provides the justification for Shayne to escalate the level of violence, as the group tracks Logan down, and traps him inside the motor home.

The bikers behave like juveniles, and seem to have a combined IQ below three digits, as Shayne seems to have the ability to convince them to do almost anything.  Logan isn't too bright either, leading to a standoff lasting several days.  A courageous Edie attempts to aid the trapped couple, leading to a brutal and spectacular action sequence, featuring some rather nasty looking makeup effects.  The film's conclusion is a bit clichd, but features some dramatic moments, with some pretty well filmed stunts.

Rather than a solid story, The Mini-Skirt Mob is mostly of interest for its mean and nasty aspects, and couple of instances of shocking violence.  Instead of being about sexy biker chicks kicking ass and raising hell, it is more about a cruel bitch, leading some weak willed idiots by the nose.  Diane McBain does a good job of talking tough, and being outrageous.  Logan and Connie might be more sympathetic, if only they acted like real people, instead of being so indecisive and ill-prepared.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1357084800,,2405,5.048101265822785

630753,4,6303316212,"I choose to watch Mini-Skirt Mob as my follow up double feature to Faster Pussycat Kill Kill this evening, and I was not disappointed, of course by all rights I should've reversed the order, but there was definitely some continuity, both films had good looking, tough, fast living girls, manipulating men to their own ends. I watch and own a lot of movies from this era, and I can't remember ever seeing one that looked this good, both the films in this set have been so stunningly remastered they look better than many of my blu-rays, I don't know how they did it, but the superb color and fidelity of these films makes them just jump off the screen, and that makes them really easy to watch. Mini-Skirt Mob isn't the best biker chick flick I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst either, the action starts fast, the chicks are dishy, and the morality is loose, the movie does lag a bit in the middle, but the last 20mins make for a worthwhile pay off. I haven't watched Chrome and Hot Leather yet, except to check if it was remastered with the same care as Mini-Skirt Mob, and it looks to be just as clean and bright, MGM has done an amazing job with the restoration of these two films, and it is really cool having some old school films looking this good in my collection, I only hope they give this treatment to future releases.",1300665600,5,1341,4.411290322580645

Blondie vs. Brunette. The brunette looked like Jane Fonda. It was like Barbie against a tame Barbarella.  This is for Chrome and Hot Leather. It was awesome, better than Miniskirt Gang. I give it a 5. It was like 2 stories: one of the bikers and one with the soldiers getting revenge. The cover was misleading. That is a shocker (ha).",1470268800,,505,4.372340425531915

Music is a lot of Drum rat a tat sounds probably because the story involves a soldier and comedic cartoony music. Minimal violence and sub par acting. Not worth the time.

7844350,3,6303316212,"This review is for the MGM Midnite Movies release of The 'mini-skirt mob' and 'Chrome and Hot Leather.'

I guess the two movies here are supposed to fit into the 'biker' genre of the late 60's and early 70's which was basically started by Roger Corman with 'Wild Angels.' However, the first one 'The Mini-Skirt Mob' couldn't be called much of a biker movie.

Don't expect any nudity or sex despite the implications of the title 'Hot Leather.' It's really all just hype.

The two movies are filled with all kinds of stars from the time period, though not necessarily 'acting' stars.
The 'Mini-Skirt Mob' stars two actresses with extensive resume's who were former child stars, Patty McCormack and Sherry Jackson. It also stars Harry Dean Stanton, an actor in many 'cult' movies such as Escape from New York and Repo Man, along with appearances in well known movies such as The Godfather, Part II and Last Temptation of Christ and the Green Mile.
'Chrome and Hot Leather' stars Tony Young as 'Mitch.' A young Cheryl Ladd of Charlie's Angels fame in any early appearance shows up briefly as Mitch's girlfirend Kathy. Prolific character actor, former Marlboro Man and bodybuilder William Smith is the biker gang leader TJ. Bobby Pickett, who wrote 'The Monster Mash' appears as one of Mitch's friends. Also as one of Mitch's friends is pop singer Marvin Gaye. Erik Estrada who would later go on to star in CHiPs makes an uncredited appearance.

'The Mini Skirt Mob' is essentially a story about an extremely jealous ex-girlfriend of a rodeo star who wants her boyfriend back. She leads a small biker gang and makes her ex's life miserable. She traps him in his trailer out in the desert along with some of her gang. From here it's up to him to get away with his girlfriend.

'Chrome and Hot Leather' is a revenge story. Mitch, a green beret, and his army buddies go in search for the killers of his girlfriend. He knows it was a motorcycle gang and that's it. Mitch and his buddies learn how to ride motorcycles and start their own 'motorcycle gang.' Eventually they meet up with T.J. and his gang.

The two movies here are decent but not great movies. I thought 'Chrome and Hot Leather' was the better of the two. Even though it was a bit campy it was still better than 'The Mini Skirt Mob' which I felt was kind of ridiculous.

Recommended for 60's drive-in fans only.",1462492800,,2366,4.6324582338902145
