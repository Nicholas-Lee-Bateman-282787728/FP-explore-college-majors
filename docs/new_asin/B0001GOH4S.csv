1999087,5,B0001GOH4S,"Before this set of DVDs, I've seen Secrets of the Matrix set and even though the information is practically the same, I liked the presentation in Secrets of the Matrix better.

In both sets, the first two DVDs deal with information that could partly be called conspiracy, and a whole bit of information that has actually become part of our present reality.  Once something happens, it's no longer ""well, maybe, who knows, or it's ludicrous"", when it happens - like micro-chipping people as if they were cattle - it has definitely become, at least some people's, reality.

The third DVD in both sets is designed to teach people to reclaim their power.  It has become popular to say that certain information has been ""suppressed"" and in these conspiracy theories that Illuminati and people belonging to different secret organizations have kept from people.  This is true, in a way, that such information is not taught in schools, but on the other hand, such information has been available for a very long time to people who desired to know.  The information may have been coded with language and symbolism throughout thousands of years, but it was there and whoever wanted the meaning of it to be revealed to him, and whoever turned within and asked that the information be revealed to him - had the information revealed (from within).

What is different these days is that this information is widely available (even though it is still not taught in public schools).  Those who desire to know - can.  It is not enough just to read books or watch videos - one has to apply this knowledge and this also implies taking responsibility for one's thoughts, emotions and life - instead of blaming the events on someone else. Ouch, this is painful to some people - being conscious of the thoughts they think, accepting the fact that our thoughts create our reality.

On this third DVD - David is explaining the mechanism of how our thoughts create our reality - from our bodies to our environment and providing some sort of scientific analogies - though without your own personal experience - just reading about the law of resonance, about vibration, about the fact that everything is made out of energy (it's both the spiritual viewpoint and the viewpoint of quantum physics) - won't be of much use to you.  Yes, you should read about it and get all the information you can, but then you'll learn and discover how it really works through daily application.

The third DVD in Secret of the Matrix set deals more with the holographic model of the universe.

Since his main topic of this last segment is transmuting fear into love - I'd personally recommend working with A Course in Miracles, though you could also read Kybalion (just for the sake of working with different universal laws) and check out Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East by Baird T. Spalding.  In the end, we all attract into our life - or rather create experiences - we contemplate and entertain our thoughts and emotions on daily basis.",1117238400,42,3008,4.737547892720307
1999088,4,B0001GOH4S,"David Icke is a very brave, knowledgeable guy who exposes the history and goals of the power structure that rules the world, as well as the spiritual/multi-dimensional realities of our existence.  It's a lot of material, and Icke gives a solid overview in this video lasting more than 5 hours.  This was originally recorded after the release of ""The Biggest Secret,"" prior to the year 2000.  This video is now available on DVD in 2004, but unfortunately it is placed on 3 discs rather than just 1, which could have been done with multi-layer DVD recording.  A similar video called ""Ruled By The Gods"" has been uploaded to an Internet site in low quality video; those who wish to have an idea of what Freedom Road covers may wish to search for and view that other video as well as read Icke's books released prior to Children of the Matrix.  There is really nothing available on video that compares to Icke's lengthy exploration of conspiracy history and empowering spirituality.  This video is quite mind-opening & mind-expanding for those who are ready.",1100563200,31,1054,4.795580110497237
1999089,4,B0001GOH4S,"This three-part video by David Icke is an excellent introduction to the theory that the world is controlled by a wealthy elite known as the Illuminati. As far as so-called conspiracy theorists go, Icke is one of the most radical. Rather than presenting his ideas in the purely materialistic realms of politics and economics, Icke looks at it from a spiritual perspective. Life, after all, is ultimately not about money, nations and governments but about energy and consciousness. According to Icke, the Earth has been under the control of a hybrid race (a mixture of a reptilian alien race and humans) for thousands of years. This control is ensured by the maintenance of ""bloodlines"" that have continued from ancient times up to the present. Icke claims, for example, that almost all American presidents can trace their ancestry back to European royalty. I would like to do more research on this; for if this is true, it would definitely be a strong piece of evidence in support of the Illuminati theory. In some ways Part Three of the video is the most valuable, as it describes ways we can take back control from the manipulators. Although Icke says these ideas and techniques have been widely suppressed, the fact is most of what he presents in this section of the video can be found in many new age and channeled books (e.g. Seth, Wicca, creative visualization, affirmations, etc.) that are otherwise tamer and less provocative than Icke's material. People who come from a conspiratorial point of view tend to be invested in the idea that everything they say is highly controlled and secret. The basic idea is that we, through our thoughts and emotions, control our own reality. While this is hardly a novel idea to anyone familiar with the new age or human potential movements, if you agree with it (as I do), you can hardly object to hearing these crucial truths repeated in an original way. I find Icke to be a very persuasive and authentic lecturer (I have also seen him speak in person). I wonder if the idea of a vast conspiracy is wholly compatible with the premise that we create our own reality. If we create everything (or if ""we are everything,"" as Icke also says), then we are also part of the manipulation that is supposedly being inflicted upon us. I actually think David Icke is wise enough to be aware of this paradox, especially compared to some of the ideologues and fundamentalists you find on the conspiracy circuit. The final part of the video, where Icke discusses the significance of the year 2012 is also fascinating, and makes me want to learn more about this. All in all, Freedom Road is an educational, informative and highly original video. Watch it with an open (if also skeptical) mind.",1053302400,15,2721,4.766949152542373
1999100,4,B0001GOH4S,"Hey, It's a good update from David Icke.  He has a lot of good information about the global conspiracy and about the nature of reality.  Check it out if you are interested.",1238284800,,172,4.34375
1999101,4,B0001GOH4S,"This was a very entertaining and well presented seminar by David Icke. It starts off a little slow before he makes a real connection with the audience, but as he gets into the heavy content, it becomes a very interesting and thought provoking presentation.  The content David presents ranges from laser beam like attention to detail to insightful facts then to strange coincidences and then some absolutely wacky stuff that is pure supposition with no chance of being proved.  Some of the coincidences presented, especially in the use of symbols by various regimes, governments and organisations, are quite confronting.
It is also clear that there are close relationships at the elite levels of power: business, finance and political.  Proof of a conspiracy? No.  Proof that the elites in power wish to remain in power to control business, finance and politics? That's a given.  Will the information help you get to your dreams? Unlikely.  Will it cause you to question conventional wisdom? Absolutely! Take what you want from it and leave the rest.  It's great to hear the views from someone who has not been sanitised by the mainstream media.

The real question that remains unanswered is why does David Icke attract so much condemnation from various groups?  Is the information that much of a threat?  And why?",1234656000,8,1313,5.009216589861751
1999102,1,B0001GOH4S,"I've just finished watching the entire 7-hour seminar.  And, it gave me an insight into David Icke's psyche.  Based upon what I've seen and heard over those 7 hours, I've come to a profound conclusion:

David Icke's cheese has slid off its cracker.

What a bunch of New Age mumbo jumbo and hoo-hah.  However, if I ever decide to become a drug user, I'd certainly enjoy his theories more - especially if I could get my hands on the same drugs he used during his Amazon jungle experiences.

I did give him one star, though.  Reptilians and Bilderbergers aside, I have to confess he's an entertaining speaker.  I didn't go to sleep once while watching him.  However, I recall nearly laughing myself unconscious during a few parts of it.

P.S.  But don't listen to me.  I'm really a reptile in disguise (grin).",1222905600,7,806,4.598591549295775
1999103,5,B0001GOH4S,Thank you for having this book available.  I enjoy David Icke's work very much and appreciate all of his efforts to imform us of what is really going on in this crazy controlled world!,1214179200,8,184,4.411764705882353
1999104,4,B0001GOH4S,"You can take Icke's theories, many of which seem nuts to me, literally.

OR, as I do, you can take most of it as METAPHOR. As metaphor, it is perfect, and wonderfully true. How could anyone better describe the monsters who rule our world than to say they are an alien, cold-blooded, blood-drinking reptile race, disguised as humans, seeking to enslave us and keep us poor and stupid? Dead-on accurate! Don't our rulers continually meet in secret conspiracies of one kind or another? Don't they constantly attempt to control the masses, strip us of our liberty, and keep us ignorant? Aren't people failing to realize their full potential because society conspires to keep us all ordinary and part of the trusting, stupid, blind herd? Doesn't society constantly wage war against us to crush our creativity, our uniqueness, our power, our passion and our love?

If so, does it really matter whether this is done by secret alien technology, occult rituals, and mind control, or by TV, junk food, endless propaganda and authoritarian government (""public"") schools?

In this important sense, there is far more core truth in Icke's wild worldview than on the editorial pages of the New York Times.

The DVD is just Icke and a slideshow. Yet he's a great speaker -- charismatic, funny, passionate and likeable -- and it is fascinating viewing. Icke throws out so much info -- at least some of which is true -- that you'll be looking up stuff on the Web for days. I rented the discs and thoroughly enjoyed watching it.

PEOPLE, WAKE UP:  Cold-blooded blood-drinking reptilian monsters REALLY ARE running the world and wrecking your life and controlling you. The State is evil. You have a right to be free to live as you choose. We need to seize our freedom back from these creatures. Icke is dead right about this most essential point, far more so than all the ""reasonable"" journalists and TV pundits and newspaper editorialists. The rest of the story -- whether they are reptiles from Mars or just creeps and criminals from D.C. -- is just minor details.",1197417600,7,2046,4.814814814814815
1999105,5,B0001GOH4S,"I have the Reptilian agenda box set, which is great information, but shame on them for not getting it recorded with better audio. I took it to a huge healing conference and no one wanted to finish it as it was hard to hear.

I can tell you all (as being dubbed an indigo child), this info is very much the truth. These Reptilians are not the only other species out there either, i can assure you of that. The truth of the 3D dimension is so much more than the eyes can see.

Though the Reptilian race is losing the war so to speak, for billions of yrs it has been a viscious battle. Many are choosing to join the Family of Light now as are many other ancient ones out there that have never known Love.

Be open to evolving as a whole for Humanity, take care of our Beloved mother Earth, and take action as best you can to over throw our Country's political agendas, as Our best interests are NOT at the hearts of any in those running our Country. Fight for GMO free foods, holistics and alternatives, for there lies the way to a stronger, haze free America. Yes we are purposly kept in a haze; drugged and in a haze not seeing what is really the Truth. Reptilians are in our worlds leadership, do the research and take a closer look at all they are trying to do; this Land of the Free is such irony; they are working diligently to make that so. Take action and choose Love over war and hate...",1167955200,11,1393,4.171003717472119
1999106,4,B0001GOH4S,"This is a well-presented, seriously engaging lecture by David Icke, which demands repeated viewing in order to take in all of the mind-blowing information.  The choice here is simple; either David Icke is mixing truth (much of it is undeniably true) with lies or conjecture to sell his wares or David Icke is one of the most important researchers, writers, thinkers of our era.  Honestly, I'm not sure which he is yet, but I'm leaning towards the latter.  He seems genuine and inspired and he offers ways to shake off the shackles of toxic modern life.  Whatever you do, don't dismiss him as a lunatic; approach his lecture with an open mind instead.  Throughout these three DVDs, Icke attempts to make sense of our history and how an elite and evil few have been controlling the masses over these many years.  And he does a damn good job!  The final disc offers a spiritual approach to breaking the chains by drawing upon ancient truths and wisdom and bringing it all together in a no-nonsense way.  These dvds are a little pricey, but so is a ticket to the ballgame... and Icke's presentation is much, much, much, more worthwhile.",1148947200,11,1132,4.681818181818182
1999107,5,B0001GOH4S,"This is an eye-opener to say the least, very easy to keep up with, David is  THE expert in this field. His research will enlighten and astonish you as to how we people are controlled and brainwashed by our media and ""elected servants"". Anyone who likes credible history, mysteries, and how this ties into reality will be blown away by this thought provoking piece.
There are those that make fun of David and others like him, there are those PAID to do so for a reason. David Icke is an amazing man, it is he who will  reap the rewards of his work (finally), people are coming to the realization that he just COULD be right!",1126483200,4,623,4.362068965517241
1999108,5,B0001GOH4S,"As the headline of my review accurately states, a friend and I originally got this DVD to sit there and make fun of it and see what all the fuss was about. ""Ha ha, this is gonna be a riot"", we thought.

Well, actually as it turns out, the DVD and Mr. Icke's presentation of information as well as the method of presentation, was quite compelling and professional. Before watching this, I had never read nor had ever seen any of his other DVD's. I had only a vague idea of who he even was, and found the DVD through Amazon's ""other customers shopped for"" feature. A lot of the information he covered in the DVD were new ideas to me, yet confirmed a lot of research I and others I know had done previously which was unrelated to the thesis of this presentation.

After watching this DVD first, and then followed by his other DVD's, I can tell you that if you were going to own or see only one of these videos, this one would be it. This is the only one that covers (almost) the entire spectrum of ideas and information that David Icke and people similar to him are all about. Even though it seems long at 6 hours, it only barely skims everything involved in this whole presentation. But even so, Mr. Icke does a very good job with the time allowed.

Looks like it was filmed in a big black room, David (and a huge projector that shows images (very clearly) behind him as he is talking) walks us through the timeline of history, from the dawn of civilization up to present day covering a sort of ""alternative history"" (providing references) which establishes the basis for his set of big points which he makes near the end, all while making a multitude of small and every interesting points along the way. He asks questions I've never heard anyone ask and sheds light on some things I've always wondered about in the process.

For those who think David Icke is a profiteer only interested in ""taking money from fools"" then think again. He has recently offered his books text to be available online to all free of charge because he ""just wants to get all the information out there"" and I bet that if one asked permission to do the same for his videos, he would happily oblige.

Now I could sit here and spout all the stuff covered in this DVD, but the thing is 6 hours and if you've really read this far and want to know, just see the DVD. If you don't want to spend the money, then rent it on Netflix. To really ""get it"" you need to see everything from the beginning because it'll sound really weird to just lay out the bottom line right here without first establishing the necessary background info.",1122681600,46,2597,4.357438016528926
