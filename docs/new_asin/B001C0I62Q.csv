8603961,5,B001C0I62Q,"FLicKeR is a documentary about Brion Gysin, a talented artist and a far-out person in general. Gysin is recognized in the film for his invention of the ""dream-machine"", which he and others used to expand their consciousness.  The ""dream-machine"" works by creating a moving-pattern of light, meant to be experienced by a participant whose eyes are closed.  If this sounds like an interesting idea to you then you must see this film to hear a colorful and eccentric array of characters talk about the effects of this machine and the wild personality of its maker.

Gysin clearly spent time with many of America's most interesting minds from the counter-culture movement and Beat generation and this is evidenced by some of the people who are interviewed in this film.  WILLIAM BURROUGHS is featured in archival footage and new interviews are conducted with singer MARIANNE FAITHFUL, singer/artist GENESIS P-ORRIDGE of Psychic TV, poet JOHN GIORNO, filmmaker KENNETH ANGER, artist/turntablist DJ SPOOKY, and none other than the godfather of punk himself IGGY POP!

FLicKeR deserves to be seen by anyone interested in the history of counter-culture, mind-expanding art, or in the biography of a truly unique individual, and it is only ONE of THREE amazing films collected as ""The Altered Consciousness Collection.""

This DVD set easily earns all FIVE STARS.",1232496000,9,1353,5.211981566820277
