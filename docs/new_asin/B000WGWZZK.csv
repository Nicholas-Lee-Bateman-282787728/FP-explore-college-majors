2969433,5,B000WGWZZK,"This is one of the real gems in an eight DVDs Time-Life collection of classic country music performances from Grand Ole Opry. This disc includes pioneering artists such as Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Johnnie & Jack, George Morgan, Hank Snow and the Sons Of The Pioneers.  Grandpa Jones, who was already a relic when he appeared in this early '60s performance (and was about to find a whole new audience on ""Hee Haw"") rips into an explosive solo version of ""Good Old Mountain Dew""; Carl Smith sings ""Hey Joe""; Eddy Arnold gives a great version of ""Cattle Call"" and Louvin Brothers fans will delight to see them on a live, mid-1950s version of ""I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby.""

This disc includes fifteen live performances (and no lip-syncing, as far as I can tell...) along with bonus features such as interviews with various Opry veterans. The material is drawn from old Opry TV broadcasts and other venues such as ""The Bobby Lord Show"" and other, long-forgotten shows that were the country equivalents of ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand."" The video quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent -- it's a chance to see many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, the way it used to be.  This collection is a true gift -- highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1197158400,21,1329,4.744588744588745
