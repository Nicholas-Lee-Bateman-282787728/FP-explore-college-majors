See, there's this cat who's hanging out at this art gallery, and he meets this artist chick, who invites him and his old lady to her groovy hideaway in the desert.  And this cat, he really digs this chick, so one night they make love, not war.  But his old lady catches them, and seems she's got a hangup about free love, so she lays a heavy trip on him.  Too bad he doesn't listen, 'cause it turns out this chick is a vampire....

Yes, The Velvet Vampire is a product of its time.  A vampire film replete with hippie counterculture icons and attitudes.  Lee (Michael Blodgett) feels little compunction about committing adultery with Diane (Celeste Yarnall), and when his wife Susan (Sherry Miles) finds out, he answers: ""Okay, so we made love.  So what's the big deal?""  Director Stephanie Rothman (a Roger Corman prot?g?) herself seems to share Lee's attitude.  Susan is miffed at Lee's infidelity, but quickly shrugs it off.  At worst, she threatens to ""get back"" at him by taking a tumble with Diane herself.

Yes, as is common to films featuring young female vampires, Diane swings both ways, although she has no clear preference.  In Vampire Movies, Robert Marrero writes that while Diane ""has no quarrels about drinking male blood ... it is quite obvious that she prefers women for sex.""  Well, it's not obvious to me.  Diane has a male housemate, and her initial flirtations are directed toward Lee (Michael Blodgett), not Susan (Sherry Miles).  Whatever pillow talk she may impart to Susan, Diane's actions speak louder than her words.

The counterculture of the 1960s has not worn well with age.  Cinema's 1940s noir anti-heroes remain influential and emulated, whereas onscreen hippies often appear silly, even unintentionally hilarious.  Yet The Velvet Vampire overcomes its anachronistic milieu, and remains a beautifully haunting film, this despite a low budget and occasionally rough production values.  Its erotic dream desert sequences, underscored with ""dreamy"" acoustic strings, evoke a psychedelic LSD trip.  Possibly, Oliver Stone was influenced by The Velvet Vampire when filming Jim Morrison's desert sojourn in The Doors.  The desert dream sequences within the two films share a deep sensibility, although Stone's larger budget naturally allowed him to shoot more than a bed and mirror upon sand.

Several critics have praised The Velvet Vampire's desert locale.  In Dark Romance: Sexuality In The Horror Film, David J. Hogan regards Rothman's locations to be her ""cleverest twists"" on the vampire legend, citing both the desert and ""clogged streets of Los Angeles.""  Actually, L.A.'s (ineptly filmed day-for-night) streets are barren at the film's start; and at film's end, the characters never get past the bus station.

Still, it's a strikingly memorable scene, intersecting counterculture with vampire mythos.  Susan is escaping Diane through the bus terminal, desperate for allies, when she comes upon a gathering of sandal-clad Jesus freaks, looking like extras from Godspell.  Eager to help, no questions asked, they descend on Diane with their crosses.  The scene is clever, humorous, and strangely poignant.  One simultaneously feels sympathy for both Diane and Susan.

In The Vampire Film, Silver and Ursini remark on the film's ""low-lit interiors full of unnatural colors.""  I didn't find the colors so unnatural, aside from a blue vs. red-orange lighting contrast, a contrast that appears in many horror films (The Lift, The Last Horror Film, aka The Fanatic).  Here, Diane sits in a red room behind a two-way mirror, observing Lee and Susan make love in a bedroom bathe in blue lighting.

More than for art decor, I think The Velvet Vampire makes for an interesting study in the cinematic use of costumes.  In the film, costumes underscore characters.

Morally pure Susan wears bright yellows, whites, and pinks.  Only after she puts on a rough earth-toned jacket (lent to her by a gas station owner) is she able to destroy Diane with her cross-wielding hippie cohorts.

The vampiric Diane primarily dresses in passionate reds and dark red-oranges when seducing men, but in stiff yellow or white dresses when approaching women.

Lee wears ""blue-for-boys,"" but switches to a morally ambiguous striped-shirt after he commits adultery.

Juan (Diane's emasculated Indian housemate) wears a pink top along with his blue jeans.

A dead mechanic's girlfriend (who is spunkier than Susan) wears a pumpkin-orange top when confronting Diane, but this strong orange color is no match for Diane's red top.

Phil Hardy states in his Overlook Encyclopedia that, despite the film's reputation, he can't see any feminist interpretation to it.  I agree there.  The Velvet Vampire is essentially about a vampress practicing a parasitic free love, who is finally defeated by an ""uptight"" woman and her Christian hippie allies.

Unfortunately, this inventive and eerily ambivalent penultimate scene is marred by a final scene; a cheap and unnecessary ""surprise twist"" ending.  Another weak point is the film's in-joke homages that are a little ... too too.  Diane's last name is La Fanu (her dead hubby, get it?), and she meets Lee and Susan at the Stoker Gallery (get it?).

Even so, The Velvet Vampire is an enjoyable tale, imaginative despite its simple storyline, occasionally tense and brutal, beautifully filmed and scored, and one-of-a-kind.",1145232000,,5405,5.1728110599078345
8064906,3,B0009PE5KW,"You don't find many vampires living miles away from nowhere in the middle of the desert, but that is where Diane LeFanu has set up residence.  Then again, Diane isn't your typical vampire.  It gets pretty darned hot in those parts, yet she is able to go out and about during the day (although she doesn't have anything good to say about the sun), and she seems to enjoy the erotic temptress more than the blood-sucking aspect of the job.  With supplies limited in the middle of nowhere, she comes to town periodically to restock.  That's where we meet Lee and Susan Ritter (Michael Blodgett and Sherry Miles), an incredibly uninteresting young hippie couple.  Lee is more than happy to accept this total stranger's invitation to spend a weekend at her abode.  Despite an unpropitious sign or two along the way, the couple finally arrives, whereupon Lee and Diane indulge in some of the most pointedly obvious flirtation ever seen by man (right in front of poor, dumb Susan).  By night, Diane secretly watches her guests; by day, she takes them on a series of mind-numbingly boring desert tours.  It eventually becomes clear that Diane doesn't want her guests to leave; she's far too busy seducing husband and wife (separately, of course) - but, of course, she has to feed eventually.  Things then waddle on to a wholly predictable ending.

The Velvet Vampire is actually fairly racy for its time (1971), featuring a fair amount of nudity.  Director Stephanie Rothman's emphasis is wholly on the female aspect of that whole erotic vampire thing.  Celeste Yarnall is pretty effective as the vampire, especially in terms of the erotic factor.  She's also the only cast member with a discernible amount of acting ability.  I would describe her as a poor man's Morgan Brittany.  The horror comes more in the form of overtones than anything else, as there just isn't a whole lot of blood-sucking going on.

On the plus side, the art show (at the, ahem, Stoker Gallery) that brings our characters together features some pretty good musical entertainment in the form of Johnny Shines singing Evil Hearted Woman.  The film's average at best, but at least the blues riffs are killer.",1136332800,,2173,4.8297297297297295
