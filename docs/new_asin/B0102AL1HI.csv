7304772,5,B0102AL1HI,Monica Bellucci is my dream girl.,1469836800,,33,4.666666666666667
7304773,5,B0102AL1HI,"It was actually kind of hard to find out certain information about this release (the Korean Studio Canal Blu-ray release), but I took a chance because  this is such a great movie...

I figured it be nice to let people know...

It WILL play on US Players (presumably Canadian players, as well).

It is also the 151 minute Director's Cut, not the theatrical version, which is not an option. It is ONLY the director's cut.

The picture quality is quite good, and miles above the 2 Disc DVD set from Universal, which is the only version I have to compare it to.

The only audio presented is the original French track, which I know bothers some people, but not me in the least....the English dub of this film was so bad, it almost made the movie into a comedy.

The subtitles presented are English, Korean and Japanese. They are optional and can be turned off completely.

This Blu-ray is well worth the purchase and I am very happy I took the chance on it.

With that said, I would like to invite anybody that is a true collector of movies and seeks out good imports, to PLEASE post product information of any films you have bought on here (on their review page) and let people know about the product details, whether they are ALL region and will play in the US, as well as both audio and subtitle options.

When I find time, I am going to do the same with other successful imports I have gotten here, but here are a few IMPORTS that I have gotten that are not available in the US, but WILL play on US Players and do have their original English track, all of which can be found on Amazon:

7304774,5,B0102AL1HI,"This Bluray is the Korean version but is in French, as is the original movie, and has English subtitles. I won't spoil the movie, just know that it is well done. Cool story and the Director and Actors do an amazing job.",1463788800,9,219,4.238095238095238
7304775,3,B0102AL1HI,Very upset right now! Nowhere does it say that this is the French version with English subtitles!  Be careful if you are looking for the English dub! Had to pull out the dvd version.,1462492800,,182,4.352941176470588
7304776,4,B0102AL1HI,Awesome I love this movie and the Blu-ray quality is great.,1461369600,2,59,4.454545454545454

7304778,5,B0102AL1HI,"The picture quality is amazing and the sound quality really enhances this great movie. I only wanted to compare it to the plain DVD and watched the entire movie, as if it were the first time. Don't mind subtitles either.",1506643200,3,220,4.525
7304779,4,B0102AL1HI,"A really good movie, beautiful exterior scenes, and action scenes. My only problem is the only Blu-ray version is only available in French with English subtitles.  The regular DVD sound track is in English. If the Blu-ray were in English it would be perfect.",1502323200,,258,4.863636363636363
7304780,1,B0102AL1HI,Movie was advertised in english.when i went to watch it.it was subtitled.false advertisment.waste of time & money.,1496361600,,114,5.764705882352941

7304782,5,B0102AL1HI,A must see if you like martial arts action and drama.  I normally hate sub titles but these don't overwhelm at the point of finding yourself reading more then watching the movie. I own the DVD with the english dubbed and it is not even close to this version. Don't miss this movie. It also has very good cinematography,1493856000,4,318,4.389830508474576

7304784,5,B0102AL1HI,"very good movie , came pretty fast, had no problems, greatservice",1490659200,,65,5.0
7304785,4,B0102AL1HI,"This film does not have any major HD or HDX streaming release. Meaning (apart from hacker sites) you cannot watch this film on Amazon, or any UVVU network (Flixster, VUDU, etc.).

This film, when released in its first HD version (D-VHS, in the Unites States), only included horribly dubbed, English version. Other has bemoaned that this film release only contains the Director's version. However, to my knowledge, it is the only HD, region 1 compatible blu-ray release. If you own a region-free playback deck (such as an OPPO) you may prefer purchasing the German version, otherwise, this is an excellent choice.",1489968000,10,612,5.0594059405940595
7304786,5,B0102AL1HI,"One of our all time favorite movies - since it was unavailable in the US, I bought the Korean version, which is in French language and has English subtitles, so if anyone in the US is thinking about buying this, you are safe and it will play in US Region Blu-ray players",1487980800,3,270,4.211538461538462
7304787,4,B0102AL1HI,"One of my favorite foreign films ever.  Have owned this on DVD for a long time, and since there isn't a legit R1 blu-ray release, I picked this up.

Visually, the print looks much clearer than my old DVD copies (I have multiple), and the subtitles are *almost* perfect - whoever translated the subtitles on this print mistakenly used a lowercase ""L"" (l) instead of using an ""i"" in words.  For example, the word ""Nice"" would show ""Nlce"" and it does this on most words with the letter ""i"" in them.

Also, about 2/3rd of the way in the film, there is one word totally mistranslated.  What should originally say ""Go STRAIGHT ahead..."" instead says ""Go STARLIGHT ahead..."".  But that is the only bad translation out of a three hour movie.

I can deal with these things, but I knocked it down a star because of that.

Also - for those of you who have the deluxe DVD editions - this is a barebones blu-ray release.  There is NONE of the behind-the-scenes documentaries featured on the Canadian 3 disc dvd edition, or the 2 disc US release.

Great movie though.  Those coats at the beginning  - so fantastic.",1486684800,5,1100,4.5

I loved this movie and I hope my friend will love it too!",1484265600,,95,3.8
7304789,5,B0102AL1HI,This movie is extremely hard to find. It is an excellent movie and I highly recommended it!!,1483747200,,92,4.470588235294118
7304790,5,B0102AL1HI,We love this movie!  Drawn into the story and not distracted by subtitles.,1483660800,,74,4.6923076923076925
7304791,4,B0102AL1HI,"Korean version plays in American players fine. Language is French, and you can set subtitles to English. The picture quality looks great.",1481932800,4,137,5.2727272727272725
7304792,5,B0102AL1HI,"Brotherhood of the Wolf is an awesome movie ...however for those looking to upgrade their DVD to the Blu-ray version with English soundtrack then you need to order it from Amazon Germany. This release also includes the Theatrical & Directors Cut of the film !

7304793,5,B0102AL1HI,If you have never seen this movie I would recommend it for those who like historical events with a plot twist.  The movie quality and sound were great.  The fight scenes were even better.  It is in French with english subtitles but that only added to the appeal of the movie.  I was not bothered by that at all.,1478563200,,311,4.220338983050848
7304794,1,B0102AL1HI,Saw this movie years ago.and.loved it. Was very excited about upgrading to.the Blu-Ray and am now pretty ticked.off that it is entirely French audio with Korean subtitles and NO option to change either in the disc settings or. MyDVDBR player. Might as well be a drink coaster. Would be nice if they listed accurately what was being sold. Sending this back.,1478390400,,356,4.852459016393443
7304795,5,B0102AL1HI,I love this movie somethings are hard to believe but the premise is good. I went to the Theater 2 times to watch this in French. Like it better dubbed to English.,1477612800,2,162,4.09375
7304796,4,B0102AL1HI,This is a great movie that I feared would never be on bluray but this import plays perfectly in my sony bluray player.,1473033600,3,118,4.173913043478261
7304797,5,B0102AL1HI,"Best period piece with well choreographed martial arts fights.  There are horrific and suspenseful moments that get you on edge.  Hardly predictable.  A classic in my opinion, to be watched again and again for a French film.",1472515200,4,224,5.0

8721299,5,B0102AL1HI,"Plays on US players. Has really good transfer quality, and the audio is quite good. There is the English subtitles or English overdubbing, which as others say is silly or quite different from the subtitles. If you like this film, this is safe to buy and will play in your US player no problem. It's a huge improvement from the standard def DVD.",1529366400,,344,4.476190476190476

8721301,5,B0102AL1HI,One interesting film. Well worth seeing but be sure to catch the 151 minute version.,1528156800,,84,4.666666666666667
8721302,1,B0102AL1HI,"So this years ago and loved the movie. So I was very happy when I seen it listed and purchased it. Very Misleading because the Title is in English so I just assumed it was. No!!! It is a Korean subtitled French Version. There is English subtitles, but not what I thought I was buying.",1521936000,,284,4.181818181818182
8721303,5,B0102AL1HI,"This is an excellent film, with solid performances all around, and fantastic stunt work. I remember the special effects for the beast were the only knock on the film when it was released, but they are better than I remembered. I love it! Image is sharp and sound is good.",1519603200,,271,4.44
8721304,4,B0102AL1HI,Title is absurd.  Le Pacte des Loups is a better title and even the English version on dvd had this listed under the English title.  French BD is better but lacks the trailer.  The cover on this is fancier.  I'd keep both,1519516800,,221,4.190476190476191
8721305,1,B0102AL1HI,"I own this film on standard definition and was excited to upgrade to blu-ray, but there are some problems.

1) It doesn't look like high definition. I put in my old standard definition disc and the resolution looks the same. So what is the point of this?

2) The English subtitles are wrong. No exaggeration, there are probably over 200 grammatical errors in the English subtitles, and when your brain notices every single one, it really takes you out of the film. Whoever wrote these clearly does not have a grasp of the language and should not be holding a position of writing subtitles. And if the grammar wasn't enough, some of it is just a mistranslation where entire words are left out. It's clearly different than the English subtitles of the American version. Why didn't they just copy those subtitles?? Why redo subtitles that already exist and do them wrong??

3) You cannot watch the theatrical version on this disc, only the director's cut. There are some extra scenes where once you see them, you'll know why they weren't in the theatrical version. They are pointless scenes that add nothing to the narrative. (I didn't take off stars for this reason, but it was annoying)

This is nothing against the actual film, or at least the theatrical version, which I think is great. But if you're like me and have been waiting years to finally get a blu-ray version in French with English subtitles, keep waiting.",1514764800,4,1418,4.728744939271255
8721306,5,B0102AL1HI,Samuel Le Bihan and Mark Dacascos are Excellent.  A Perfect All Action Movie.  The Fight Scenes are Outstanding.,1510704000,,112,5.166666666666667
