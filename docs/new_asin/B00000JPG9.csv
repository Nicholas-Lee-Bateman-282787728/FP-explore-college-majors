The animation is excellent, and the opening segment is so beautifully drawn and flawlessly executed that you have to remind yourself that you ARE watching an animated program. The Celtic music throughout is a welcome bonus, and adds to the impact of this wonderful video.

Children and adults alike will find this charming story well worth the price. If you feel you can't watch it without a child present, RENT one. This is a ""keeper.""",1374364800,,533,4.857142857142857

1236259,1,B00000JPG9,"The description of this DVD claims that it is the ORIGINAL English version of the recording. In fact, the voices have been dubbed in with American actors.

I am not impressed.",1164585600,2,175,4.645161290322581
1236260,5,B00000JPG9,"Sean is the cutest white duck with a British accent you will encounter in a video suitable for all ages. On this the flying south for the winter day, Sean and his friend Puffin, who has a colorful beak that reminds me of a cereal box, are chasing gulls.
They come across a fox but escape for the time being and find Sean's Mother telling them it is time to get ready for flying. Sean bids farewell to Puffin for the winter, hoping to see each other come Spring. Up above the sounds of the other ducks leaving with the flute music in the background of the video. Sean's Dad is late in arriving because he forgot his whistle.
Sean falls from the sky landing in the water while his Mother realizes he got lost and goes to look for him, leaving the Father with his two smaller siblings. Sean makes it out of the water and rain begins. A brown animal named Voley arrives and greets Sean.
Voley wants to sleep for the winter in his burrow in the ground, but Sean states he cannot survive without Voley. "" I could sleep for ages if you told be a very boring bedtime story"". Voley comes back with a funny line, "" You'd only be up every hour on the hour asking for a glass of water"". Before Voley leaves he tells Sean to look for the lambs since they are the first sign of spring arriving.
Puffin ends up lost from the cloud cover with Sean taking care of him and teaching him how to play music with grass.  Soon the lambs are visible and they make their way to the boat with a surprise visit by Voley before finding their parents.
I never get tired of viewing The First Snow of Winter with my children and have watched it many times when they are asleep. It has such an appealing quality with the flute music bringing tears to my eyes and lumps in my throat.

A few months ago my son got our video stuck inside the TV/VCR.  This is a hard to find video.  This is well worth the price, my only complaint is the shortness of the video, about twenty minutes.",1061164800,,1947,4.184
1236261,5,B00000JPG9,"This is a wonderfully warm, endearing and funny story about a little duck who gets knocked out of the sky by an airplane, during his family's annual flight south for the winter. He meets a wonderful animal ""Voley""  (I think it might be a mole)who loves to riverdance and teaches him how to  prepare for the winter. There's riverdancing with the sheep, teasing  squirrels so they can throw down nuts for the duck to hoard, a couple of  chase scenes with a fox, friendship and laughter.  The music is warm, soft  and uplifting. Sean the duck is lovable.  His wonderment at everything that  Voley introduces him to is believable and refreshing.  My almost 3 year old  daughter claims it's her favorite movie, and I really do believe her.  It's  such a sweet movie, that your heartstrings will feel a tug or two  throughout.  There are no really bad scenes, just a fox chase my daughter  loves, and a very happy ending.",950832000,8,915,4.596273291925466
1236262,5,B00000JPG9,"My 3-year-old grandson and I have new favorites in Sean, Puffy, and Voley.  The lessons learned by the little duck are good and sincere...Voley was a master teacher.  The first time, I was apprehensive regarding a child's  reaction to the hungry fox and the separation of Sean from his parents.  However, now that we know the happy ending, the film provides a repeated  happy experience each time we watch it.  I am giving it as a gift to share  with other children at Christmas.  The humorous reference to  ""Riverdance"" is a great touch.  I hope I can find other films by  the same director/writer.",945043200,10,599,4.663461538461538

7913041,4,B00000JPG9,"Bought this for my movie collection for my granddaughters to watch when they stay overnight .... the oldest one is almost 7 and she loved it.  Her little sister, just turned 5, did not like it ... the fox is super scary and there is one surprising realistic, violent scene that sent her flying to my lap for comforting .... cute story, but definitely not for sensitive little ones!  Side note, I actually didn't like that violent scene either!  Sensitive Grama!",1481500800,,461,4.666666666666667

They call it Sean and a Fox movie... they watch it almost every day and every time they get very emotional, especially in the end when Sean is reunited with his parents and twin sisters. The movie teaches good values. This used to be one of the favorites for my son who is now 8. He still enjoys watching it with the girls and they all dance together with the characters when the music comes on. Highly recommend this movie for little kids! I'm planing on buying one for my little nephew.",1391644800,,545,4.25
