8604908,5,B00EF1PKXW,"Samuel L Jackson is not an actor who has the Denzel face, the Will Smith Charm, nor the Shemar Moore body, but what he has is talent. To the world at large Samuel L is known for his uncanny use of profanity but if you know that environment in which he derived from then you would know that he is a reflection of the world of the black male. Samuel L Jackson has a way of making you feel his emotions. In the environment that created a Samuel L you had better be a good trash talker if you are going to walk the walk. ""Say what again!"" He can take it there because he knows that type of lifestyle but he's a well rounded actor because he's great at being a black man, this is a talent that Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't always exemplify. But that's not to say that Cuba is a sell out, it to reiterate the fact that Samuel L Jackson is the people's (black America) everyday black man, jive talking and pimp walking.",1410998400,,907,4.101123595505618
