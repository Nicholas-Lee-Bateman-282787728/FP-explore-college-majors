8552767,2,B00AJX0UHQ,"great information, but there is NO MENU or way to skip from chapter to chapter to view what you want to see without starting over from the beginning every time! for $20 i would expect a video that works properly. because of this i give it low marks.",1398384000,2,249,4.208333333333333
8552768,1,B00AJX0UHQ,"Not really for the experienced cookie decorator.  Also, This DVD does not have a menu, I have two players and  neither of them will skip from chapter to chapter -  I have to fast forward to reach the the instructions I want to review and it seems agonizingly slow and a waste of time.  This is my second DVD and it's the same as the first one.",1394496000,5,343,4.074626865671642
8552769,3,B00AJX0UHQ,"I'll start by saying I'm a fan of Julia's.  I have both her books.  I've been decorating cookies for awhile but I still found it helpful to watch her demonstrations.  A beginner would find it really, really helpful, I would imagine.  A lot of the techniques she describes I learned the hard way, after trying many not-so-successful approaches first.  Wish I had had this video long ago.

That said, as was commented upon by another reviewer, the lack of a menu is maddening.  To stop and return later means you have to hold down the fast forward button until you get to the chapter you left off on, which can take awhile.  I would have given her at least a 4 star had this not been the case.  I also quickly got over her cheery ""Live sweetly!"" slogan at the end of each section, complete with decorated cookie in front of the screen repeating the same mantra.",1391558400,2,859,4.420382165605096
8552770,4,B00AJX0UHQ,"Very helpful details for beginners and those wishing to learn more about cookie decorating alike. My only criticism is that there appears to be no menu on the DVD so it's very hard to watch portions of the DVD without scrolling through the entire thing, this is frustrating.",1391385600,,274,4.729166666666667
8552771,5,B00AJX0UHQ,Loved this DVD which showed a brief demonstration and tips on how to decorate cookies! Highly recommend to new cookie decorators.,1390348800,,129,5.190476190476191

8552773,4,B00AJX0UHQ,"I am a beginner in the cookie decorating arena.. I just fell in love with Julia's video and plus I purchase the book for a backup. Julie take you step by step through the art of cookie decorating.. I just love it. The only thing I do not like about this dvd, is that chaptering is not available for  section. You have to run the whole DVD to get to the section you need. Other that that!!! I LOVE IT.",1381104000,3,400,4.0
