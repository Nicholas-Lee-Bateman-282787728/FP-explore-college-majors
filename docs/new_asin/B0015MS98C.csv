8259165,3,B0015MS98C,"I was very excited about getting this set.  The videos, however, feel a bit dated and bland.  Better than most, and the 20 minute chunk format is great for teaching, but I guess I was hoping for something students would be more excited about.  It's good solid information with interviews from experts and case studies, just not that exciting for high school kids.",1363996800,,363,4.73015873015873
8259166,5,B0015MS98C,"If you are sociology student or just trying to explore more knowledge on society and human interactions, this is the best video for you. The videos give you insight on the way we live, how society is organized, family structure,racial inequality, wemen's right, civil right,and many other relavants topics covered in colleges and universities today. It is 22 video lesson, very entertaining, and it featured real life scenerio. The video cover various interviews with experts, sociologists and other historians. I do recommend this DVD set for students who may no have enough time to read those bulking textbook and who just want to have some knowledge in sociology.",1266019200,2,666,5.175925925925926
