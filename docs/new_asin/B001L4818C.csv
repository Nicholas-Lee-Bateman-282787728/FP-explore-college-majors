But Scotties are not the best puppies for young children.  Scotties play hard, and can be stubborn.  They didn't get the name die hard for nothing.  If you want a puppy you can cuddle and kiss, don't get a Scottie!  They are very independent and only give affection on their terms.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Scottish Terrier.  I have two, but this video makes it sound like they are the perfect dog for everyone and that just is not true.",1244678400,2,593,4.385321100917431
