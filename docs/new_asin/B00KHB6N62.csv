Also the quality of the dvds have gone down, before they were colorful and creative but this disk looks horrible, it's not damaged it just looks really cheap. Also it's missing key plot point episodes and my most favorite episode an American Benwolf in London is also missing, why would that one not be included it is tied in to the monster theme. Even with Animo Crackers not being added, it has a tie in to the next season but since that one hasn't been aired it still is important. I could see not adding Collect This or Cat Fight or even Bengeance is Mine but this was just really disappointing.

I love this season, it had lots of good and funny episodes, but when the bonus episodes are the Zombozo episode and mystery incorporeal when it was already apart of the season it is just an insult, a bonus episode to me would be the Cat Fight and Collect This or actually make this worth something and give us episodes from the next season that hasn't aired yet, it would make fans excited to buy it, just to see the sneak peak at the next season, I mean CN has done that with adventure time releasing a never before seen episode in the boxset.

I was so excited about this season I pre ordered it, and I waited and waited and just the sheer disappointment I love 4 out of 5 episodes that's on it, but I loved so many more episodes in this series this season in particular, please stop insulting your fans and release the dvd sets properly each season isn't even 26 episodes long keep the fans happy and give us the stuff we want to see, again this would be different if we were getting another set with those episodes in it but we aren't seeing this. Some of my favorite episodes aren't being put onto disk, and fan favorites aside, all episodes should be put to disk.

also if this isn't a big sign something got messed up Gut Rot is on the back of the dvd case, yet his episode he appears in is not on the disk what the heck!",1411603200,2,2068,4.256997455470738
6429395,3,B00KHB6N62,"Hello, everyone. I am both happy and upset at this DVD release. I am happy because Galactic Monsters was my favorite season of Ben 10: Omniverse and that it's being released around the time that I estimated it to be. However, I am upset because this release (like the volume before it) does not have all of the season's episodes. It leaves out the other three Galactic Monsters episodes: ""Bengeance is Mine"" (Ben uses Ghostfreak and Snare-Oh, both of whom are shown in the season's intro [with Snare-Oh being seen twice], and the beginning of this episode sets up the plot for the next one), ""An American Benwolf in London"" (Ben regains Benwolf/Blitzwolfer in this episode, who is featured twice in this season's theme song), and ""Animo Crackers"" (Ben unlocks the new alien Gutrot, who is also featured in the Galactic Monsters intro). So as you can see, Galactic Monsters applies to all eight episodes, as opposed to just the last three. Having said all this, I think Cartoon Network should put those three episodes on this disc as they are as much a part of this season as the other five episodes are. It would also be nice if Cartoon Network would round off the set by having ""Max's Monster"" and/or ""Catfight"" as bonus episodes or having a monster alien database featuring Blitzwolfer, Snare-Oh, Frankenstrike, Ghostfreak, and Whampire.",1400803200,7,1339,4.851528384279476

8658890,1,B00KHB6N62,I ordered this for my son's 5th birthday. He was so excited about this gift and when he opened it his feelings quickly changed to disappointment! The case was empty! I am so furious! The case even had the plastic casing on but there was a slit cut on the side so someone could easily slide it on or off. This was deliberate and thanks to who ever decided to rip me off my son's feelings were hurt on his birthday.,1462579200,,413,4.111111111111111
