5716776,4,B00CDV4OEC,"Walter Pidgeon brings his debonaire quality to this screen detective, based upon mystery novels of the 30's, Nick Carter.  The three movies are enjoyable, though in the second one Donald Meek gets a little too much for me; Pidgeon does a fine job caring off the sophisticated detective genre.  My only complaint is:  I wish there were more of these Nick Carter movies made.  If you enjoy light mystery stories, I recommend Nick Carter sits next to your Nick Charles and Charles Chan volumes!",1369699200,47,491,4.809523809523809
5716787,4,B00CDV4OEC,"There are three of these and definitely seemed to be going down hill from one to two to three.  Walter Pidgeon, before stardom came his way, was charming and sassy in the first feature, became somewhat horny and a bit nasty in the second feature and went wholehearted horny and nasty in the third.  At the price for the three, the first is a good enough deal, and you get a chance to see dear Walter with good material and start to sink with somewhat lousy material and almost completely sink with really lousy material.

5716808,5,B00CDV4OEC,"W-B Archives treats us to an engaging trilogy of lightweight MGM-produced murder mysteries, with a steady Walter Pidgeon at the helm. The plots are less convoluted and play out more like traditional crime dramas, in that they are as much about how & why a crime was committed than just a bunch of suspects and a load of red herrings thrown at the viewer on the way to finding out who the true culprit was. Too bad more films weren't made for this character. I would've enjoyed dozens of them - IF they stayed this classy and well-produced. These NICK CARTER mysteries are definitely a cut above the Monogram and PRC studios' programmer offerings from the same era. The action and stakes feel bigger and the posh MGM pedigree is evident throughout. They feature more well-known actors, larger, more lavish sets and treat the viewer to some pretty nifty visual effects to help drive the plots. Don't get me wrong, the airplane footage in the first film, for instance, is obviously bluescreen miniature work. But it shows that at least The Big Lion was trying with these movies.

Pidgeon is so in-charge and yet surprisingly laid-back here. I only know him from his intense turn as the imperious Dr. Edward Morbius in the enduring sci-fi favorite FORBIDDEN PLANET. His work as the dashing, ever-confident Carter has inspired me to start digging up some of his other work. His Carter can be a tough guy, but he's quite mellow compared to some of the other two-fisted gumshoes of the era. Also, he's a self-proclaimed plain old New York City P.I., not some lofty, well-revered world-famous detective. I particularly enjoyed the sly digs at both Sherlock Holmes & Charlie Chan by Carter in the first film, too. Cute. Donald Meeks plays Carter's unwanted, unconventional and slightly unbalanced assistant, Bartholomew ""the Bee-Man,"" aka Beeswax. I found the guy grating at first but some actual character development for him over the course of the three films helped him to grow on me. I have to admit that the bees he raised, (and frequently employed as living weapons!,) were an interesting and admittedly clever gimmick - and they did help save Nick's bacon more than once. In the end, Bartholomew proved to be an enjoyable departure from the usual bumbling, bug-eyed comedy relief characters found in other murder mystery series.

Audio quality is solid & consistent for all three films and the video portion looks good but not great; no artifacting or pixelation is evident, despite encoding 3 1/2 hours worth of films onto one single-sided DVD. Some print damage can be found sprinkled throughout all three movies (specks, scratches, dirt) but it's pretty minor and not enough to really complain about, especially when you remember that none of these films received any sort of restorative work whatsoever. Lastly, PLEASE NOTE: this is a DVR-r/manufactured-on-demand release, which means older and/or finicky DVD players may have playback issues; buyer beware! This W-B Archives Collection 3-film/single disc release also includes the respective trailer for each film but, like most of their other MOD product, there's nothing else in the way of extras and NO SUBTITLES. The movies run a breezy 60-70 minutes a piece. Bottom line: if you like 1940's murder mysteries then I think you'll enjoy these, too. And as Nick always says, ""If I'm wrong, I'll apologize.""  ;-)  5 STARS for these engaging, family-friendly whodunits from Hollywood's golden age.",1420070400,2,3449,5.003484320557491
5716809,4,B00CDV4OEC,"I agree with the reviewer that says Donald Meek steals the show.  I think it is because unlike so many of the old detective sidekicks, the Bee man is a full action figure.

If you find you like him, too, read up on him in the Internet Movie Database web site and you'll find he was really an interesting character.  (imbd.com)",1417824000,,444,4.176470588235294

5716815,4,B00CDV4OEC,"On  the verge of Mrs. Miniver and the other top films he made during and just after the war, and well before he co-starred with Jackie Gleason on Broadway (using his fine baritone voice which can be heard in his early thirties films), Walter Pidgeon did three of his better movies of the era, as Nick Carter. He is a natural for the part and contributes to the generally insouciant role (similar to what Warren William was doing at the same time) the light touch it required. Donald Meek, a supporting player in both A and B films, I always delight in seeing, as I did then. He is an acquired taste, however, and may rather irritate than entertain any given person.
If you like to watch films made during the first dozen years after movies really began to talk (Jolson had only a few lines of dialogue along with his singing in the historically credited first movie to talk), this should be a good relaxing hour for you.",1410566400,2,920,4.443786982248521

5716817,3,B00CDV4OEC,"It's different with Pidgeon as a combination of all what was popular during the time this was made.  It looks like they took a old time radio program that was very popular during the age of radio and tried to bring the series into the movies.  During the 40's the film makers and studios would jump on these radio programs and turn them into movies as the characters already had brand name and well know by a faithful following on radio so they would jump the program to the movies.  There are a lot of examples out there but I won't go into them and just finish this.  The series is very, very ""G"" rated and very dated and it exactly what I wanted.",1409875200,5,649,4.209677419354839

5716821,4,B00CDV4OEC,"Walter Pidgeon played Nick Carter in a series of 3 MGM films in 1939 and 1940 and the three films were released in the last few years by Warner Archives.

The first film was, Nick Carter, Master Detective (1939) which saw Nick heading to California to investigate the theft of plans for an advanced aircraft and sabotage of the factory.

This film is engaging  and breezes by in 59 minutes. The mystery isn't all that complex, but the film is interesting for its look at a time when the aviation industry was very young.

Carter as portrayed on the film, jumped to conclusions and made plenty of surmises about people's guilt, some of which were far fetched but promised repeatedly, If Im wrong, Ill apologize later. A line that would be used in other films, though not as frequently as  here.

The second film was Phantom Raiders (1940) and it was probably the worst of the three. The film was expanded to 70 minutes, but really didn't seem to know what to do with the extra time, so it opted for padding. You could start watching the film ten minutes in and really not miss anything.

Carter is brought in on a case where several boats are being blown up at sea by the same company leading to massive insurance payoff. This film because of the first ten minutes (which gives away the plot) is much less of a true whodunit and more of a battle of wits between Nick and the villain which does work fairly well.

The location shots are good and the plot progresses nicely. Other than the very boring first ten minutes, my big complaint is that Nick keeps trying to bow out of the case in a way that hardly seem consistent with the heroic reputation of the character.

Finally, we have the best film of the series Sky Murder  (1940) which has Nick investigating a murder that occurred in the air. The movie was one of those pre-war films that really dealt with the war in Europe and fifth columnists in the US. This 72 minute film was exciting, well-paced, suspenseful, and with some lighter moments included as well. In terms of B Detective movies, it didn't get much better than this. This movie makes the whole set worth buying.

Overall, I found this to be a very good series of films. The glaring flaw with the series was that the Nick Carter on the screen had very little relation to the Nick Carter off the books. Through fifty years of pulp fiction, Carter had been established as a resourceful tireless he-man who looked at danger and laughed in its face. Carter also surrounded himself with younger detectives who he was mentoring, thus the title master detective.

Pidgeon plays Carter as much more typical Mystery Comedy lead. Carters no fool, but hes also a bit of a ladys man and in The Phantom Raiders hed rather catch up with the ladies and take a vacation than bust up the ring.

And as for assistants, Nick has Bartholemew (played by Donald Meek), a middle aged bee keeper and wannabe amateur detective who attaches himself to Nick with Nicks sufferance more than anything else.

It was Hollywoods practice in the 1930s to pay to adapt characters to the screen and then shove these characters into the formula of the moment, which is why there was a series of Nancy Drew where Nancy was a little bit ditzy, and two Nero Wolfe films where Archie Goodwin was played as a typical punch drunk Lionel Stander character.

Even with this flaw, these three movies are good in and of themselves. The stories are well-written and theres plenty of action for a film of its era though it's not bloody. There were a couple of machine gun scenes in this series that were thrilling.

Even Bartholemew works as a sidekick, particularly in the last two movies. While similar characters from the golden age of film usually became  nothing more than annoying comic foils, Meek turns in a solid performance and Bartholemew actually becomes a valuable asset to Nick in the second and third movies, comfortable with a gun and with using some trick action to get the upper hand on the bad guys.

The series stands up well. Only lasting for three installments meant that unlike Mr. Moto or The Thin Man, the Nick Carter series didn't stick around for one film too many.

The DVD itself is up to the usual standard of Warner Archives with no thrills but three good and very rare films with decent transfers. The only mistake made was that Warner put Phantom Raiders before Sky Murder but this is only of trivial importance as it really doesn't matter which order you watch these in.",1398124800,5,4473,4.561797752808989
5716822,3,B00CDV4OEC,"I don't know, this collection just didn't keep my attention--at least not like the Falcon movies.  If you like having the old movies in your collection, I would recommend you buy it-- if just for that sake.  I was a bit bored watching the triple feature, however.",1397088000,,263,4.574468085106383
5716823,4,B00CDV4OEC,"The Nick Carter Mysteries Triple Feature starting Walter Pidgeon contains three good mysteries.  The first ""Nick Carter Master Detective"" basically introduces you to Nick and his sidekick ""Beeswax"".  It becomes apparent that Beeswax is the real brains in the operation although Nick feels he is as they find the person sabotaging the innovative high-speed airplane.  This feature is 59 minutes long.

The second feature is ""Sky Murder"" features Nick and Beeswax spoiling a spy operation while protecting a woman marked for death.  This feature is 72 minutes long.

The third feature is ""Phantom Raiders"" and once again features Nick and Beeswax solving the mystery of why cargo ships keep exploding in the middle of the ocean.  It is 70 minutes long.

All features are B&W and filmed during the forties.  This was my first ""manufactured on demand"" DVD I purchased from Amazon and was extremely pleased at the quality of the picture and sound.

We are both really into the old detective mysteries that came out of the golden age (Charlie Chan, Nancy Drew, Philo Vance, Thin Man, etc.). But the idea of Walter Pidgeon (the same actor from Mrs. Minver and How Green Was My Valley) playing a hard-boiled detective in his flawless white linen suit? Come on! But I must admit, he's great. The plots are simple and extremely innocent, but a nice change after watching the ghastly nightly news.

5716843,5,B00CDV4OEC,"While this series of films were clearly intended to capitalize on the widely popular Nick Carter and his adventurous exploits, the presence of Donald Meek as ""Bartholomew the Bee-Man"" elevates this series several notches in entertainment.  While intended to be a mere comic relief, Meek's potential as a character and ally sleuth is too much for either Walter Pidgeon or the film itself to contain.

Indeed, the very concept of the ""Bee-Man"" is extremely original.  Not only is Bartholomew a beekeeper by day and aspiring sleuth by night, he is so invested in aiding Nick Carter that he literally has no idea just what exactly Nick's mission is and personally concocts his own fantasy version of the nefarious villains Nick Carter is pursuing.  This also adds a very interesting relationship between Nick and Bartholomew in which Nick tries everything in his power to get rid of the pesky Bartholomew (a nutcase as far as he's concerned), which only further drives Bartholomew to get involved and prove his worth.  The ""Bee-Man"" element adds a further usefulness for the character, as he literally has an endless supply of obedient bees in various pockets on his person that attack and sting on command.

And he certainly does show his worth, by second film in particular has Bartholomew save Nick Carter's life on at least three occasions, including being instrumental in taking down the main villain.  Whether Nick Carter likes it or not, he owes his life to him and should seriously reconsider his repeated offers as an accomplice.  And indeed, by the third film, Batholomew IS working alongside Nick Carter, even taking on his assignments and motivates a less invested Nick Carter in solving the mystery.  Alas, it seems like the filmmakers realized how much Bartholomew literally solved the assignment for Nick and consequently stole the spotlight in the second film and gave him more of a sidekick role and noticeably less screentime in the third.  Still, he gets some very memorable scenes in.

The first two films are probably the best, with an unusually high dose of action for the genre, entertaining plots and, laugh out loud comedic interplay.  The third is good too, but not quite up to the first two.  Very much recommended for those interested in the Secret Service/detective/soldier of fortune genre of the '30s.",1384128000,8,2328,5.0

5716855,5,B00CDV4OEC,"Yea ok I'm old but not as old as these movies but I still love them. Mostly made in the late 30's and early 40's they show a long gone type of humor and morality that no longer exist. Can you believe that Walter Pidgeon was a heartthrob of young girls in the early 40's. I guess he was one of the few left in Hollywood that wasn't in the service.

Take these for what they are. Imagine people sitting in the theater and holding hands and laughing. Hey, they're fun to watch. I think compared to today it was a better time.

Granted, there are many old movies that are ""hokey"" and out of date, but not this one. The plots are engaging as there are unexpected twists. I think that these movies are clever and fun.  Mind you, I am not a professional critic who looks for specific qualities.  I just enjoy old mystery movies that are entertaining with a clever plot and comic relief.

5716881,4,B00CDV4OEC,"The dashing, tall, dark-haired Nick Carter speaks in deep resonant tones.  He is as cool as iced tea;  no matter how dire the situation, he calmly deals with it.  Unfortunately, his sometime-partner Bartholomew the Bee-man - a man who carries bees in his pockets and under his bowler hat - tests the limits of Nick's imperturbability;  at one point, Carter becomes so exasperated with him, that he dumps him head-first into a rubbish can!

He sends a company plane to pick up Nick Carter . . . . (Note:  nice action in this film.)

""Sky Murder"" (1940) (4) -  Ruthless fifth columnist will stop at nothing - including murder - to keep their nefarious movement secret, but when motorcycle cops find a murdered man lying amidst bundles of anti-democratic flyers, Senator Monrose is alerted, and through his well-connected friend Mr. Grand, they enlist the services of Nick Carter . . . .

""Phantom Raiders"" (1940) (2) -  Apparently respectable men are defrauding a British insurance company by secretly blowing up their own ships at sea, blaming mysterious and unknown raiders.
