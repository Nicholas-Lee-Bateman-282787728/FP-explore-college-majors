8048868,5,B0007MCH66,"This incredible concert was filmed in 1983. Although it is from the same tour as the Live Loud Alive lp, it is not the same show as the epic double lp. The show is an incredible performance from 4 incredible players. It is however a dvd that requires an all region dvd player. The video and audio quality are top notch.",1412208000,,319,4.245901639344262
