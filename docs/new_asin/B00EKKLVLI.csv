It arrived wrapped in plastic and was brand new!!",1492041600,,71,4.538461538461538
8606396,2,B00EKKLVLI,"I love the product. The reason for the low rating is because when I got the package the book was damaged , I suppose from rough handling. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars",1480204800,,183,3.972972972972973
8606397,5,B00EKKLVLI,This is the complete movie collection on Blu-Ray with a film negative of movie and a book about each movie.  Each movie has special features and the movies are in high definition.  The cast and crew talk about the making of each movie and how the movies relate to the Star Trek universe.  This is a limited edition collection and is great for Star Trek fans who really love Star Trek.,1470873600,6,384,4.380281690140845
8606398,4,B00EKKLVLI,"Beautiful collection, but as another person posted a couple pics and film cells were put in upside down. Just wish they'd put a little more time into those details since this is for Trek collectors. Aside from that the films and included extras make this a great set.",1466812800,2,267,4.583333333333333
8606399,1,B00EKKLVLI,Leave it to Paramount to let an upside-down screenshot from Star Trek II make it into the final product.,1462406400,5,104,4.526315789473684
8606400,5,B00EKKLVLI,"This is a great addition to my collection. I'd had the collectors' editions (with all the extra features)on dvd and was hoping that they would come out on Blu-ray (the early Blu-rays were the bare-boned releases). I waited a long time and the wait was worth it. I watch them all, even the ones that I don't like as much. I got what I wanted so I am satisfied. Now I would appreciate it if Paramount would release DS9 on Blu-ray.",1457222400,18,428,4.296296296296297
