This story echoes scenes from other movies: The Third Man, the 1941 The Maltese Falcon, etc. It is not as good as either. Its main fault is its overly complex plot and implausible story. After the defeat of Nazi Germany most of its collaborators were revealed and caught. I find it unbelievable that one rich man in a country could be that powerful without anyone noticing. Yes, a newspaper baron has power but only if he can convince most people to act against their self-interest. Its not like selling a brand of cigarettes.",1426723200,,3391,4.87001733102253
