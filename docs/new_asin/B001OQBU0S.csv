3731959,4,B001OQBU0S,"It's funny that I used to make fun of the Lawrence Welk Show growing up. Now I really enjoy listening to the music, and seeing the performers I knew when I was a kid. I also enjoyed seeing the original commercials that were included in this special. Brought back lots of memories.",1389139200,,280,4.403846153846154
3731960,5,B001OQBU0S,My mother has moved in with us and she was a big fan of Lawrence Welk.  It was nice finding this on DVD so she can watch whenever she wants.  The DVD was true to it's claim and it was delivered very quickly.,1366416000,,207,3.7906976744186047
3731961,5,B001OQBU0S,My Mother so enjoy's watching Lawrence Welk every Saturday just as she used to do years before. These bring back such wonderful memories for her. The music and dancing is very entertaining.,1356566400,,189,4.9375
3731962,1,B001OQBU0S,"Again, this is a terrible production.  It is grainy and hard to see.  It was a waste of money.",1265155200,4,94,3.8947368421052633
3731963,1,B001OQBU0S,"Have purchased a number of these Lawrence Welk DVDs for my elderly father (87).  All but the New Year special DVD have worked fine.  As was previously and very accurately reported in a 7/4/09 review, this New Year DVD does not work.  Since I'd purchased it prior to the other customer, but had waited till Thanksgiving to give this New Year (and also the well-working Christmas) DVD to Dad as a slighly-early Christmas present, I only recently realized the defect in this DVD, which was then confirmed when I checked the recent reviews of the New Year DVD and read of the other customer's same problem.  I believe the problem is due to some software/programming code that was not updated when the producers of the DVD apparently decided late in the production process to eliminate one of three episodes.  On the main menu screen of the DVD, the two shows on the DVD appear as numbers 2 and 3, with number 1 not noted anywhere.  When the ""Play All"" command is activated with the DVD player's remote control, the color of the command changes, as it should and does with the other Welk DVDs, but nothing happens, and the actual episodes never come on screen.  Since the other customer had first asked for a replacement DVD of the New Year show, only to have it, too, be defective, I opted to return mine to Amazon for credit.  Even though it had been 6 months plus since I'd purchased this DVD, I was graciously given no trouble whatsoever while discussing the situation on the phone with an Amazon customer service rep., and my account was credited, as I send the DVD back to Amazon, with a return UPS label the customer service rep. e-mailed to me immediately after my phone conversation with him.  Disappointing that the DVD is defective, but not Amazon's fault, and they have made good very easily.",1260835200,3,1799,4.614420062695925
3731964,1,B001OQBU0S,"This dvd did not play. Returned it for another one(same one)and it still didn't play. So I ordered a completly different one and it was fine. Amazon was very quick about the exchanges and refunds. Great place to order from. Prices are great and speedy delivery and free shipping and handling over $25.00, which isn't to hard to do know a days. The one dvd is just a dude. I've bought others and there fine. I rated it one star only because they wouldn't let me rate no stars.",1246665600,2,475,4.348314606741573
3731965,5,B001OQBU0S,The 1960's was the best time for The Lawrence Welk Show. The stage sets were Great and the stars were Great the songs and music were Great and it was starring good looking and family like people and it was just a delight and a joy watching. The Lovely Norma Zimmer sings pretty and is so nice and The Lennon Sisters have a pretty girls next door quality. The costumes are all nice. Steve Smith has the boy next door quality usually singing solos and sometimes with one of the Lennon Sisters. Steve Smith was a regular for 5 years in The Lawrence Welk Show originally joining with The Blenders singing group. Bob Lido sings and plays the violin and Bob Ralston plays the piano. The Lawrence Welk Show is one of the Best musical variety shows in TV History. The 1966 episode was filmed in color though for some reason the DVD release is in black and white. The Lawrence Welk Show is a show that will bring many people happiness and if you like being happy and the family feeling of TV you will want this DVD for your collection.,1236124800,4,1026,4.348958333333333
3731966,4,B001OQBU0S,"I am a bit disappointed with this video.  The shows chosen for this WERE NOT New Years shows, but the first shows of the year.  The 1966 show was originally in color, but was presented in black and white on this DVD.  The picture quality on the 1963 show was only fair.

The two earlier DVDs from Synergy gave three shows, this gave only two.

While these are good shows from the best times of the Welk show, I was expecting a bit more.  They are definitely better than the mid 70s to early 80s shows that PBS pushes down our throats nearly every week!

I hope Synergy continues to offer these 50s and 60s shows in the future, but it wouldn't kill them to clean up the videos a bit more, and offer three shows instead of two.",1233360000,11,725,4.172661870503597

8331157,5,B001OQBU0S,"I enjoy listening to the Lawrence Welk band's specials.  It brought back memories of times I spent with my grandma. She loved listening to Lawrence Welk and shared her enjoyment with me.  The sound and recording of the picture isn't the best, but you can still hear the wonderful band, the great singers, and see the dances. I enjoyed all the specials and episodes of the Lawrence Welk Show.  Glad I discovered them on amazon!",1391040000,,426,4.653333333333333
