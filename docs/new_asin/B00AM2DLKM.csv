8553478,4,B00AM2DLKM,"Forced to leave his beloved country of Poland during Communist rule, this Lithuanian production of the life of the Nobel Prize winning poet and the impact that he had amongst his contemporaries is moving, well done (although a bit clunky at times) and full of vintage photos and clips. I was fortunate to meet Milosz in 1985 when he was a professor at the University of California in Berkley and, although I own and have read several of his books, I never fully understood (and maybe never will) what a complex and spirited intellectual he was. The 21st century world needs to rediscover his message now more than ever because he poignantly and passionately observed and lived through one of the most brutal centuries known to modern man. His writings reveal a remarkable insight between universal themes and personal struggles in a way that very few poets have ever managed to capture.",1400544000,2,886,4.8355263157894735
8553479,4,B00AM2DLKM,"The Age of Czeslaw Milosz is a two-disc documentary that portrays Czeslaw and his life through various people he had become close with throughout his later life. Unlike most documentaries that display very ""text book"" type material, this documentary not only displayed his inspirations, accomplishments, and struggles but it also showed his personality and how much he meant to the people around him. He is noted as the hero of history and literature of his time, but from watching this documentary, it was clear that he was also a hero to many people who knew him personally.

This documentary goes completely into depth of his life, as well as historical events that was going on during, such as World War II. Although the documentary contains such serious topics, the entire tone of the film is peaceful, humorous, and passionate, much like Czeslaw was himself.

Anyone who is a fan of the great Czeslaw Milosz is sure to love this documentary and should see it. It is a highly informative and personal account of his entire life and his life's work with many heart warming stories; and in all the it was a very enjoyable documentary.",1376352000,4,1137,4.825641025641025
