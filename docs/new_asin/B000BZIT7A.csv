8094831,5,B000BZIT7A,"If you like old-fashioned flamenco from the 60's and 70's this is your cup of tea. Not puro gypsy, definitely not nuevo. The sets and costumes are hokey (think Ed Sullivan Show) and the recordings were made before bulerias became so wildly popular, but the choreographies are clearly visible if you are a dancer looking for steps and the falsetas are not hard.",1385596800,2,360,4.73015873015873
8094832,5,B000BZIT7A,"I simply love this DVD.  This is the simple flamenco of the early days when it was just the cante, the baile, the guitar, and the palmas.  There are no cajones, pianos, violins, and all that other ""fusion"" contemporary stuff of today which, to my taste, has corrupted what flamenco originally was.  True, what's on this DVD is stage flamenco, which is to say that it is choreographed, and not the improvised gypsy juerga style flamenco.  But what professional flamenco performance isn't choreographed these days? I'd say the dancing on this DVD is more in the classical Spanish style of Jose Greco or Antonio Gades, with the beautiful body lines and traditional costumes, which drew me to flamenco in the first place.  I wish that the flamenco of today would cycle back to this style, where the men donned the traditional flamenco costumes that really shows off their graceful figures and beautiful body lines, rather than what you'll find today, which is men wearing more baggy street-style clothing with long hair.  And the movements are more traditional as well.  You wont' find any of the modern dance movements in this DVD.  This is flamenco in the purely classical Spanish style.

8094833,2,B000BZIT7A,"Film quality is good, but performances are riddiculous. Maybe shall please flamenco experts.
Performances were filmed in black and white and participants are very old stiled flamenco dancers.",1288742400,,191,5.857142857142857
8094834,3,B000BZIT7A,"Masters of Flamenco - Early Television Concerts was worth the price just to see what popular Flamenco looked like in the 1950s-60s. I had hoped to see some traditional dancing, but only got a lot of machine gun tachoneo.  This technique, when used for most of the dancing, is strictly for tourists and television. The male dancers were trying too hard to look like Rudolph Valentino.",1217289600,7,383,4.803030303030303
8094835,1,B000BZIT7A,"Poor quality video from old TV shows.  Not very traditional in an attempt to ""update"" flamenco in the 1960s.  I'd not buy it. All black and white the cover is not part of the show.",1210032000,4,180,4.114285714285714
8094836,3,B000BZIT7A,"Flamenco is divided into: Cante(song), Guitar, and Dance.

If Cante is your thing, then don't buy this DVD, 1st part has no cante & the recording in the 2nd part is terrible (the sound keeps fading in & out).

If Guitar is your thing, then don't buy this DVD, the camera hardly focus on the guitar player, and as I said, the sound recording keeps fading in & out.

If Dance is your thing, then you should definitely buy this DVD, but keep in mind this is not the Pure Gypsy Flamenco Dance, this is more the Commercialized Flamenco Dance with a lot of Tapping & Castanets which were added to Flamenco Dance for Tourist Attraction.",1137196800,65,629,4.405172413793103
