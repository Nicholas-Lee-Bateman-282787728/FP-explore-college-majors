7768093,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"I actually purchased the DVD for 'Christmas in Connecticut'. I had only seen it once but remember Barbara Stanwyck's performance.  Saw the other one with Diane Cannon and IMO it was really lacking. 'Christmas in Connecticut' on this DVD is more believable and funny.  'The Shop Around the Corner' with Jimmy Stewart, what can I say, have always been a fan. Never heard of 'It Happened on 5th Avenue', it has been added to my special Christmas movie list. The story was very good and some of the actors went on to have their own television show.  Finally, 'A Christmas Carol' 1938, great.  The movies are old and were printed in black & white because at the time it cost too much to use color film.  These movies are old Hollywood, with very sound, well known actors.  All are classics.  If that is what you are looking for, with a Christmas theme, this DVD is it.",1261267200,,863,4.493589743589744
7768094,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"I enjoyed all the movies, but my favorite was It Happened on 5th Avenue. It makes you realize what ""wealth"" really is.",1260748800,5,118,4.409090909090909
7768095,4,B01GWBZ3K2,definitely a necessary addition to your holiday movie collection - and a phenomenal price for all four!,1259712000,,103,5.117647058823529
7768096,3,B01GWBZ3K2,"These four films would cost you you about 4 times the price if you were to hunt for them individually. The only fly in the ointment is that the movies are on two double sided discs. This can send some  screaming into the night,but if it doesn't bother you then you're laughing.
A Christmas Carol(1938)is a Christmas Carol light;for those who want their taste but not all the ""calories""!.Clicking in at a speedy 69 min.it is no wonder this film was a TV staple for years until they began pushing the Alistair Sims version back in the 70s. The film is non stop and is over far too soon. By now we all know the plot of a miserly businessman who abhores Christmas and who gets his wake up call courtesy of three spirits;becoming a new man. The film doesn't linger on little plot nuances(that would have improved it immensely)like the door knob coming to life,or his old love,or his reunion with his nephew,etc. When Owen(Scrooge)argues with Fred watch the spittle literally coming out of his mouth and don't mind the wires when he ""floats"" out the window with the ghost of Christmas present. Also Scrooges'young sister talks very much like Stan Laurel while Feziwig,not to be outdone,does his best Stan Laurel smiling;it's uncanny! 2 1/2 stars.
It Happened on Fifth Avenue(1947)stars Gale Storm(well known later for her own show on TV),Don Defore(to become well known on TV as Ozzie and Harriets'next door neighbour and later Hazel's boss),veteran character actors Victor Moore and Charles Ruggles. Moore is the central character,a street bum,who inhabits a  mansion that gets deserted so many months a year by its millionaire owner played by Ruggles. The games begin when the house becomes inhabited by more and more people and who are eventually caught by the owners' daughter. But she plays along as a fellow down-and-outer and falls in love with an ex-GI(Defore),even getting her father and mother in on the act. The film has its' charm but is not engaging enough to maintain interest on a consistent basis. Moore's den-motherish tongue waggings can get a little old quite fast and he seems a little out of place in such a lead role. Funny enough the gags in this film are the best things about it. Good and funny lines are given just throw away status and  have little of the punch they otherwise would have had in a better film. Further,later in the film there is a beautiful sequence with Defoe and Storm sitting at a wobbly legged table and a waiter who tries to fix it. He comes to one side,goes under and reappears at the other side,and is repeated much to the couples amazement. It is so good it is out of place. Overall there just isn't enough spark in this film to give it any more than a 3 star rating.
Christmas in Connecticut(1945)stars Barbara Stanwyck(of TVs Big Valley fame;and yes she was a substantial star way back when!)who is a columnist who writes about her daily life and her cooking in a beautiful home in the country,with her hubby and child. Trouble is it is all made up;even her boss(Sydney Greenstreet)doesn't know it. But the jig is up when the boss invites himself to her ""place"" for Christmas. Stanwyck enlists the help of her Uncle Felix(SZ Sakall)for cooking and general back-up chores and a hubby-wanna be played by Reginald Gardiner. Throw in a hero GI(Dennis Morgan)who falls in love with this ""married"" writer and bedlam reigns supreme. This is a film that tries hard to be better than it is. Stanwyck and Sakall really do dominate this picture but their efforts aren't enough to save it from its' 3 star status.
The Little Shop Around the Corner(1940)stars Jimmy Stewart as a head clerk who toils in a general store in Budapest,run by Frank Morgan(stage and screen vet and the wizard in the Wizard of Oz).At first all is seemingly ok but Morgan has private troubles with his wife and he thinks Stewart is behind it. As tensions build a new clerk starts at the store played by Sullivan and Sullivan and Stewart start rubbing each other the wrong way. Morgan fires Stewart because of his suspicions and is suicidal. He ends up in the hospital,apologizes to Stewart when the truth comes out and makes him acting manager. All along both Sullivan and Stewart have had pen pals and Stewart is amazed to learn his pal is none other than Sullivan,but she remains oblivious to the end. This is a very smart and engaging film. Lubitsch reigns the actors in and all really under-play their parts to get a more immediate and ""real"" effect for their characters and it works wonderfully. In typical Lubitsch style it is a film that wants to tell its' story in its own way and if you keep with it you will be rewarded hansomely. Many films would have had Sullivan and Stewart in the dark for much of the film(with a double late-film revelation)but here he lets one of the two in on the ""secret"" and we watch how Stewart tries to deal with it,adding an extra dynamic to the plot which otherwise wouldn't have been there. This film deserves its' 4 1/2 stars;the best film in this collection.
All films have been transferred pretty well and all have the same features present on the discs than if you were to buy them seperately. An FYI,It Happened on Fifth Avenue has no features or even scene selections on it at all(!),just a play option.
Overall,for the price,this is a nice collection of mostly average Christmas films with Christmas Carol the poorest,The Little Shop Around the Corner the best and the other two falling into the middle. If you can stand the two double sided discs then this is certainly worth getting.",1258070400,89,5543,4.683076923076923
7768097,1,B01GWBZ3K2,Even though the product detail shows this collection as COLOR.  The only thing in color is the DVD Sleeve!  All movies are BLACK & WHITE format only!,1257897600,22,149,4.481481481481482
7768098,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Christmas in Connecticut is a great holiday romantic comedy about a young woman who writes for a magazine geared to homemakers. She claims to be married, have a child and live on a farm in Connecticut, but is actually a single, childless, apartment dweller. The problems start when her publisher wants her to give a recent war hero a home for the holidays on her Connecticut farm. She consents to marry a long-time boyfriend who actually has a farm in Connecticut to save her editor from losing his job. They arrange to be married on the farm, but the judge doesn't get the job done before the war hero arrives. That creates some awkward moments. The housekeeper tends babies for women who are working during the war, and they are supposed to be ""the child"" but with a different baby showing up each day confusion ensues. Stanwyck's character, of course, begins to fall for the hero, who is also falling for her but thinks she is a married woman and is trying to respect that. It is all good, clean fun and ""What a Christmas!""

The Shop Around the Corner is a very clever comedy whose theme has been repeated in other movies, as mentioned in Annie's review. Clara is falling for the man with whom she corresponds on purely intellectual subjects. She has never met him. At the same time she gets a job in a leather goods shop and cannot get along with her boss (Jimmy Stewart). You can figure it out from there. Delightful fun. Either one of these two movies is worth the price of this package.

It Happened on 5th Avenue is a pleasant film. The owner of a 5th Avenue mansion is wintering elsewhere and a hobo helps himself to the house. He invites in others who need a place to stay in the housing crunch following WWII. Without their knowledge, one of their fellow tenants is actually the owner, who hides his identity to see what is going on in his home.

Everyone knows the story of A Christmas Carol, so I won't elaborate on this one. This is a wonderful set of holiday movies at a price that can't be beat. If you don't like black and white movies this may not satisfy you, but the stories are great and my family really enjoys them. The only complaint I have is that they are double-sided disks and I prefer single sided.",1256601600,64,2227,4.440097799511002
7768099,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Warner's TCM GREATEST CLASSIC FILMS COLLECTION is a series of over two dozen twin packs. The four titles in each set are dubbed one per side on two flip discs. Only some movies include bonus features. Transfer quality of these well-preserved ever-popular films is top-notch. All titles in TCM's ""Holiday"" set are rated in the 7s and 8s at imdb.

Trivia on movies---

Each version of Dickens' famous yule story has its fans, and the '38 A CHRISTMAS CAROL is no exception. This 69 minute Loew's release features an interesting company behind Reginald Owen as Ebenezer Scrooge. Gene and Kathleen Lockhart are Bob and Mrs. Cratchit and their daughter June plays a Cratchit child. Leo G. Carroll is Marley's ghost and Ann Rutherford portrays ""Christmas Past."" Silent-era clown Billy Bevan, who also lent his raspy basso voice to early Looney Tunes shorts, appears as ""Leader of Street Watch.""

In the romantic comedy CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT (1945), Sydney Greenstreet is third billed behind Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Miss Stanwyck's character was based on Gladys Taber, a ladies magazine columnist who lived on a Connecticut farm. John Dehner cameos as a state trooper. Dehner began as a Disney animator, then appeared often on radio-- he was Paladin on HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL. Other cast members: Reginald Gardiner, Una O'Conner and Frank Jenks. Also here is ""ditzy blonde"" specialist Joyce Compton. (To see Miss Compton at her nuttiest, check out Eddie Cline's 1940 turn-of-the-century farce,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-VILLAIN-STILL-PURSUED-HER/dp/B0006IUE98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUED HER</a>, with Alan Mowbray as the baddie and Buster Keaton playing his opposite.)

IT HAPPENED ON FIFTH AVENUE (1947) was the very first ALLIED ARTISTS release. This company was formed when MONOGRAM Pictures and two smaller outfits merged. Frank Capra was slated to direct until producer-director Roy Del Ruth purchased screen rights to this story of a homeless man and his friends who take advantage of a manson left empty while the owners are away for the holidays. The fine cast includes Don DeFore, Ann Harding, Charles Ruggles, Victor Moore, Gale Storm, Grant Mitchell, Edward Brophy and Alan Hale Jr.

Ernst Lubitsch's holiday romance THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (1940) was a first screen adaptation of Hungarian playwright Mikl&oacute;s L&aacute;szl&oacute;'s ""Perfumerie"" (aka ""Illatszert&aacute;r""). This storyline was later used for the 1949 musical,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IN-THE-GOOD-OLD-SUMMERTIME/dp/B0001DCYU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME</a>&nbsp;and in 1998 for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YOU-VE-GOT-MAIL/dp/B000YDBPAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YOU'VE GOT MAIL</a>. Director Lubitsch, who also worked in a Budapest shop as a boy, called this his favorite movie. Unlike most productions, all scenes were filmed sequentially. Cast includes Margaret Sullavan, Jimmy Stewart, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut and in a walk-on, Sarah Edwards.",1253491200,127,3151,6.201372997711671

The Shop Around the Corner is a classic. It's such a great story line that it has been remade two more times: In The Good Old Summer Time (Van Johnson and Judy Garland) and most recently as, You've Got Mail (Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks).

7768167,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"I was very satisfied with this collection of Christmas classics. First, I liked the fact that the films came in individual discs instead on 2 films on each side. Second, this was a really good selection of Christmas movies. I found each one funny and entertaining.

If I were to select a favorite one, however, it would have to be The Little Shop Around the Corner with Jimmy Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, and Frank Morgan. This was a very simple movie with a powerful story. It is mainly about a romance between its protagonists (played by Stewart and Sullavan). They fall in love through letters discussing literature and poetry while constantly fighting against each other at the little shop where they work. A secondary story, an adultery, involves the shop's owner, played by Morgan. The little shop also has funny and down-to-earth characters like Pirovitch and Pepi. I find one of Pirovitch's lines unforgettable. When Kralik (Stewart) tells him that a romance has evolved at an intellectual level through his letters with the anonymous pen pal, Pirovitch answers, ""What else can you do through letters?"" Pepi's sarcastic phone conversation with Mrs. Matusheck in front of the shop's employees and ending in a ""You can draw your own conclusions"" is simply hilarious.

The other two films, Christmas in Connecticut and It Happened in Fifth Avenue were pure comedies. The first one is with Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan, and it's plot moves around the funny adventure of a single woman who writes for a magazine about domestic life. She pretends to be married and with a child, and that she lives in a farm in Connecticut. All this is unkown to the magazine editor (played by Sidney Greenstreet) whose only goal is to promote the ideal family to increase the circulation of his magazine. The plot gets more complicated when Stanwyck falls in love of the war hero she is supposed to host at her farm in Connecticut as planned by the magazine's owner. In order to get out of this mess, the journalist has to pretend to be married and to own a farm complicating matters and creating very funny situations. It Happened in Fifth Avenue reminds one of a Kapra film. It is about people who are down-on-their-luck living in the mansion of a millionaire during the post-war era. There is romance and comedy along with a social message reminiscent of a Kapra film. A Christmas Carol is the 1938 version with Reginald Owen and retells the famous Dickens classic. As the other films, it is well-restored, and in spite of its simplicity and predictability, it can be enjoyed.

In sum, this collection is one of the best TCM classics I've seen. Also, the special features announced in the description here are in the discs.",1481414400,3,2717,4.838709677419355

Not only does it contain the four films shown on the cover:

Christmas in Connecticut (1945)
A Christmas Carol (1938)
It Happened on 5th Avenue
The Shop Around the Corner

It also contains:

Star in the Night (Vintage Oscar-Winning Short) 1945
Jackie Cooper's Christmas Party (you'll see many big stars serving the kids, most of whom I didn't recognize)
Judy Garland Sings Silent Night (along with a church choir)
Peace on Earth (Classic Oscar-Nominated Cartoon in which the animals learn about the meaning of Christmas)
A New Romance of Celluloid: The Miracle of Sound (MGM Short Subject that helps us understand how the then-new sound recording systems worked) (1940)
A Great Story is Worth Retelling (actually a series of text pages)

All of these are great movies and features, I highly recommend this collection that has MORE than the four titles on the cover.

Go Get it, or borrow it from your local library.

As I have time, I'll add my comments about each title.

CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT

Christmas in Connecticut is a delightful holiday comedy. A magazine columnist, adored by many readers, describes her beautiful farm, wonderful meals, and even writes about her husband and baby. The public loves her. The only problem is that all of these details are well-written figments of her imagination.

Now, imagine the comedy that will ensue when her publisher, who thinks she lives on a farm instead of in a small big city apartment overlooking drying laundry, asks her to play hostess for a returning war hero, then invites himself also.

Comedy breaks loose, and you have to see it to believe it.

There is an unexpected bonus on this DVD (at least I didn't expect it). ""Star in the Night"" is a feel-good movie about Christmas, an Inn that is full, and a couple that need a room, ending up in the barn.

Everyone pitches in to help, even the mean old woman who hated the Christmas Carols which were keeping her from falling asleep.

A CHRISTMAS CAROL

I love every version of ""Christmas Carol"" -- even the crazy ones like ""Scrooged"" and the ones with role reversal (ladies as Scrooge, etc.).

What I love about this 1938 version is that Scrooge's nephew Fred likes to slide down the street and interacts early with the Cratchit children. I also enjoy that this version, unlike some of the others, lets us see the reborn Scrooge visit both Fred's house and the Cratchit house at the end. We also see accusations that Scrooge must be mad. Wouldn't that make sense in the real world, if someone hated something all his life, and then suddenly loved it?

I highly recommend this movie, even if it's older than I am. (It came out when my dad was 16.)

If you'd like to learn more about the many retellings of this story, see:

** History, movie adaptations of ""Christmas Carol"": en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_A_Christmas_Carol
** Public Domain: 1910 Silent 11 minute Movie: archive.org/details/AChristmasCarol

Even the 1910 version is not the oldest, there are two older, but you'll still enjoy downloading it and watching it. It's amazing that they could squeeze everything into an 11-minute movie.

I highly recommend this 1938 version of this Charles Dickens classic.

7768349,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"I bought this set to see if  ""A Christmas in Connecticut"" was as good as it was supposed to be. I was not only pleasantly surprised by the goofy cheer of that movie, but I've also been treated to other films of good holiday cheer. In particular, I think ""The Shop Around the Corner"" is an excellent example of good writing not wasted. That it's based on a play is not a surprise.

I can highly recommend this TCM Holiday film collection. You get over 7 1/2 hours of, at the least ""interesting"", and at the best ""laugh-out-loud funny"" entertainment.

Disc 1
""A Christmas in Connecticut"" (1945 B&W 101 minutes)
Subtitles in English, French and Spanish
This movie is probably the best known of the four feature films, and it's a laugh-out-loud screwball comedy. Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane. She writes a successful column for ""Smart Housekeeping"" magazine. The column is called ""Day by Day in the Connecticut Farm House of America's Most Resourceful Home-Maker"".
The magazine publisher (played with glee by the great Syndey Greenstreet) decides to mix patriotism with Christmas spirit, and invites a recuperating sailor to spend a down-home Christmas with Lane's happy family. Of course, the publisher expects an article about the experience to boost circulation: ""American Hero Spends Christmas on Perfect Farm.""
There's only one problem - Lane is not married, she lives in an apartment and she can't boil water. With a lot of zany help, she manages to hold on to her job and fall in love with the sailor at the same time. Totally unbelievable situational comedy, but that's why it's called ""screwball"", right?
Disc 1 Special Features:
....A. ""Star in the Night"" (21 minutes) This short won a 1945 Oscar for ""Best Short Subject/Two-Reel.""
Christmas Eve night, and middle-aged and disillusioned Nick is putting up a new lighted star in his courtyard. He and his wife Rosa own the Star Auto Court, with cabins, a restaurant and filling station - and the lighted star will be seen for 20 miles. He tells a seeming bum that ""Peace and love and brotherhood, it's a lot of baloney."" And he seems to be proven correct by the people who come in. But then, something happens, to all of them, and it is an amazing Christmas after all.
For all that it is schmaltzy and predictable, this is also a heartwarming story.
....B. Theatrical Trailer for ""A Christmas in Connectcut"" (2 minutes) Tag line: ""Finding the Right Man on The Wrong Honeymoon!""

Disc 2
""It Happened on Fifth Avenue"" (1947 B&W 115 minutes)
Subtitles in English and French
A big sign is attached to an old NYC apartment house:
""Michael O'Connor Enterprises - Modern 80 Story Office Building To Be Erected on This Site""
The sign flaps over the scene of the evicted tenants trying to cart their stuff out right before Christmas. But there's one holdout. Jim Bullock in 4G, discharged and unemployed, has handcuffed himself to his bed. The manager pleads, ""But Mr. Bullock, you had ample notice. Please put on your pants and vacate at once.""
It is a futile gesture on Jim's part. Next we see him sleeping on a park bench, when by a Christmas-y change of fortune, he is introduced to Aloysius T. McKeever, a bum of impeccable manners, and, it turns out a place to sleep. McKeever stays in a Fifth Avenue mansion while it's owner, industrialist Michael O'Connor (yes the same one) is away. That McKeever is uninvited is beside the point. From here, the characters snowball and the situation snowballs and by a very circuitous route, every one has a Merry Christmas.
Another silly comedy with lots of heart and some laugh-out-loud moments.
....No special features

Disc 3
""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1940 B&W 99 minutes)
Dubbing available in French. Subtitles in English, French and Spanish
Matuschek & Co is a dry goods store on Balta Street in Budapest, Hungary. Chief clerk Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart) has a pen pal for whom he's all but fallen in love. He's yet to meet her, but one thing he knows for sure, she can't be anything like his argumentative co-worker, Klara Novak, who seems to love to bedevil him.
Christmas is nearly here, and Matuschek asks everyone to stay a little late to redo the display windows. Oh, no, Alfred must get away on time, because he's finally set up a meeting with his ""Dear Friend"". No no, Klara can't stay late, either, because she has a very important first meeting herself.
It's a classic set-up and it is wonderfully done. Here's Alfred talking to Pirovitch, another clerk, about his excitement and trepidation to finally meet his pen pal: ""Ever get a bonus?""
Pirovitch: ""Yes, once.""
Alfred: ""You know, the boss gives you the envelope, you wonder how much is in it. You don't want to open it. As long as the envelope's closed, you're a millionaire.""
Hugo Matuschek is wonderfully played by Frank Morgan (best known as the Wizard of Oz). The whole cast is great - see special Feature C for more. This movie is full of situational humor. It's funny, but usually not in a one-liner way. It's the characters playing off  each other marvelously.
Special Features:
....A. ""Cast & Crew"" This is just a one-page written feature.
....B. ""A New Romance of Celluloid: The Miracle of Sound"" (about 1939 B&W 11 minutes) The first half of this pre-movie short is about how sound is added to a movie. Of course, it's not like this now, but this is interesting. Narrator: ""One time we told you that if it were not for cotton, there might not be any movies today. For it is from cotton that celluloid motion pictures film is made. This time, we tell you that if Thomas Alva Edison had not invented the phonograph, you might never have thrilled to the magic of the talking picture.""
Douglas Shearer, MGM sound engineer, tells us that ""we have a camera capable of photographing a voice"". Everything is presented in ultra-layman terms, but, as I wrote, it's interesting.
The 2nd half of the short is made up of mini-trailers for MGM movies in the making.
....C. ""A Great Story is Worth Retelling"" Written, 6 screens. ""The Shop Around the Corner"" started as a Hungarian play which producer Ernst Lubitsch had wanted to film for years. This movie, along with ""The Philadelphia Story"" (also 1940) made Jimmy Stewart a top Hollywood romantic leading man. It's a plot that's never gotten old. It was remade as a musical in 1949, Judy Garland starring in ""In the Good Old Summertime"".  Most recently, Nora Ephron brought it into the modern era in ""You've Got Mail"". As written: ""In a nod to its source, [Meg] Ryan's store was called 'The Shop Around the Corner'.""
....D. Theatrical Trailer (4 minutes B&W) Mr Matuschek (Morgan) introduces his shop and employees in this charming trailer: ""I'm sure that the bargains you get here will more than make your trip worth while [to Budapest]. It's the kind of a shop where you get a $3.50 value for $3.48.""

Disc 4
""A Christmas Carol"" (1938 B&W 69 minutes)
Subtitles available in English, French and Spanish
Everybody has a favorite movie version of Dickens' classic. This one with Reginald Owen as Scrooge is not my favorite, but it's a nice version never-the-less. A highlight is when the reformed Scrooge brings a goose and presents to the Cratchit house, and Mrs. Cratchit hides in the pantry because Scrooge is obviously out of his mind.
The conversion of Ebeneezer is not so well drawn as other versions (I'm partial to Alastair Sim's Scrooge, as well as the musical ""Scrooge""), but I get teary-eyed at Tiny Tim's death no matter which version I'm watching.
Special Features:
....A. ""Jackie Cooper's 'A Christmas Party'"" (1931, 10 minutes B&W) A pre-movie seasonal short. Nine-year old Jackie Cooper wants to invite his football team to a Christmas party and his mother agrees. Too many kids are eventually invited, and Jackie has to have his Christmas party at MGM Sound Stage No. 2. Lots of cameos by MGM players, such as Clark Gable and Bette Davis serving. Totally staged, of course, so it's no surprise when Jackie makes a speech at the end: ""All the folks at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  wish you and all your folks a Merry Christmas.""
....B. ""Judy Garland Sings 'Silent Night'"" (2 minutes) A young Garland sings one verse as part of a church choir. I'm not sure if this was part of a movie or not.
....C. ""Peace on Earth"" (10 minute color cartoon, 1939) This cartoon was nominated for an Oscar in ""Best Short Subject/Cartoons"".
It's Christmas time in a snowy bombed out Europe. Squirrels have made homes out of army helmets, and carolers sing ""Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men"". Two youngsters ask their squirrel Grandpa, ""What are men?""
Grandpa replies, ""Well, there ain't no men in the world no more, sonnies.... But, as I remember the critters, they was like monsters. They wore great big iron pots on their heads.""
This cartoon was a hit two years before Pearl Harbor. America was still in an isolationist stance in 1939, the year when Britain and France declared war on Germany.
....D. Theatrical Trailer (2 minutes) Titled ""A Fireside Chat with Lionel Barrymore"", the aging star touts the movie ""A Christmas Carol"" with Reginald Owen.

7768350,5,B01GWBZ3K2,Excellent.,1416614400,,10,10.0
7768351,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"The reason to buy this collection is for ""The Shop Around the Corner"" and ""Christmas in Connecticut."" The other two movies--""A Christmas Carol"" (with Reginald Owen as Scrooge"") and ""It happened on 5th Avenue"" are ho-hum mediocre. (To my mind, the best Scrooge is played by Alastair Sim--that's the one to get--or by George C. Scott in a version made of TV, also outstanding). ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1940) is, to quote movie critic Leonard Maltin, the ultimate in sheer charm. And charm is the word for Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. The chemistry between them is palpable and, rumor has it, continued off-screen. They play arguing co-workers in a Budapest notions shop who don't realize they're lonely-hearts pen pals. Frank Morgan is perfect as the shopkeeper who believes (mistakenly) that Stewart is having an affair with is wife. The movie was remade in 1998 as ""You've Got Mail."" Equally charming is Barbara Stanwyck in ""Christmas in Connecticut"" (1945). It lacks the crackle of ""The Shop Around the Corner"" but is fun to watch anyway. Stanwyck plays a magazine writer who's supposed to be a mother and an expert homemaker, who is forced to entertain a war veteran (Dennis Morgan) and her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) for the holiday, on a farm in snowy Connecticut. O what fun it is. Warm Christmas ambience, good supporting cast, and a tad long. If you want to jump-start the Christmas feeling, these two movies will do the job nicely.",1416355200,,1452,4.90650406504065

Jimmy is cruel and Margaret is weak. We already had and love Christmas in Connecticut (annual xmas favorite). We collect ""Christmas Carol"" and have a dozen versions including this one from 1938. This one has the Lockhart family as some of the Cratchits including a young June (Lassie & Lost in Space). A fun surprise was ""It happened on 5th Avenue"" which I had never heard of. It is a delightful story about a hobo (Charlie Ruggles) who lives in a mansion while its owners are at their other house for the winter. A homeless ex-GI  finds refuge with him. The owners daughter runs away from finishing school and stops by the mansion to collect clothes and finds it inhabited.

Shop Around the Corner is amazing and is one of my favorite movies. I would definitely recommend. Watched It Happened on 5th Ave. for the first time and really enjoyed that as well.,1392508800,,341,4.428571428571429

Included are the original ""Christmas In Connecticut"" which outshines the pale  modern  remake and ""The Shop Around The Corner"" which was the inspiration for  the revamped ""You've  Got Mail"" . A superb version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and the rarely seen ""It Happened on 5th Avenue"" complete this disk. If you love old movies, you'll love this collection.",1392163200,,477,5.142857142857143

7768464,3,B01GWBZ3K2,The movies are wonderful! The reason I only gave a 3 star is because of the packaging. All FOUR movies are just stacked together with NO protection from scratches. I had to re-package into their own protective covers.,1391817600,3,217,4.7368421052631575
7768465,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"This is a great value.  Some of the movies are better known that others, but all are worthwhile.  It Happened on 5th Avenue demonstrates how bad the housing shortage was post WW2, blending both comedy and drama.  Stewart is fabulous in Shop Around the Corner which was made into You've Got Mail in the 90s.  Christmas in Connecticut is the best of the bunch IMHO.  Barbara Stanwyck had just played the evil wife in Double Indemnity and wanted a property that would put her in a sweeter light.  She plays a Martha Stewart type columnist, but in reality gets all her delicious recipes from ""Cuddles"" Sakal.  Mistaken identities, the addition of the handsome Dennis Morgan as a sailor on leave etc make this a terrific view.",1391817600,,721,4.674603174603175

It has three of my all-time favorites - Christmas in Connecticut, Shop Around the Corner (the precursor to You've Got Mail) and It Happened on 5th Avenue.  The Christmas Carol is also included, but I prefer the 1951 version with Alstair Sims, however this one is quite watchable too.  These are all great movies that put you in the holiday spirit and that have feel-good endings.  Great family viewing too!",1389916800,,460,4.7974683544303796

'Christmas in Connecticut' is an old favorite of mine as is 'The Shop Around the Corner' with Jimmy Stewart in it. I like 'The Christmas Carol' also but must admit that one of the other versions is my all-time favorite. This is a great collection of Christmas movies.,1389830400,,405,4.413333333333333

I couldn't be any happier with the quality of the films.  I would recommend it this selection to anyone who loves to watch classics around the holidays.  Sometimes I like having them on while I decorate the tree or wrap presents.  The disks do not come in separate containers, they are stacked one on top of the other, but that did not really matter to me.",1389830400,,560,4.346153846153846

7768503,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"If you want to be entertained, this collection is well worth the price. This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is totally upbeat - not completely in sync with the tone of the Dickens novel, but a great pick-me-up offering of the tale and especially appropriate for watching with the younger kiddies (not as scary as some of the more faithful versions). ""It Happened on 5th Avenue"" is just sweet and a wonderful opportunity to see Ann Harding again - one of the major actresses of the early 1930s. ""Christmas in Connecticut"" is a lighthearted romance with a bit of screwball comedy thrown in and ""The Shop Around the Corner"" is visually delightful. The snow effect gives its such a fairytale effect. If these don't put you in the mood for a merry Christmas, nothing will. The only fly in the ointment for me is the casting of Margaret Sullivan in ""The Shop Around the Corner."" She imbues her character with such hatefulness, I find it hard to believe that Jimmy Stewart can possibly love her. Judy Garland's take on the character in ""The Good Old Summertime"" is much more enjoyable for me to watch - the crankiness is softened. On the whole, though, I'll take the earlier version every time. This a collection to add to your collection!",1389571200,,1232,4.655963302752293
7768528,5,B01GWBZ3K2,Collection is as  advertised.  Its a great  and happy addition to your holiday movie collection Although personally I believe the Alstair Sims ( spelling) version of A Christmas Carol is the best.,1389484800,,196,5.0625

7768584,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"Christmas in Connecticut is a must-see for the classic film lover, especially those with an interest in vintage 1940's fashion. Barbara Stanwyck plays a Martha Stewart-type who writes a magazine column and readers think she is the perfect domestic goddess, when in reality she is a fur-coat loving single Manhattan girl, who orders out all her food and can't cook. The pushy publisher of the magazine she writes for invites a WWII hero along with himself up to her pretended Connecticut farm for Christmas. Hilarious complications ensue. Delightful from start to finish.
I purchased this film collection for Christmas in Connecticut, because I couldn't find it sold singly anywhere else, and it was, I am sad to say, a few years before I got round to watching the other films.

I enjoyed The Shop Around the Corner because I'm a fan of the subsequent film it was based on ""You've Got Mail."" I adore Jimmy Stewart. Didn't so much love Margaret Sullavan, she's a bit odd looking. I guess I'm just more used to Jimmy Stewart starring opposite more glamorous women like Grace Kelly and Kim Novak. But the plot is adorable, with the two of them engaged in an anonymous romantic correspondence while being feuding co-workers in real life.

It Happened on 5th Avenue was a charming gem of a movie, with actors I wasn't very familiar with aside from Charlie Ruggles and Alan Hale, Jr. A homeless man stays in the New York mansion of a millionaire who abandons it every Christmas in favor of his property in another state. This time around though, the homeless man finds himself with numerous houseguests, three of whom end up being the family who actually own the house. Characters pretending to be people they are not while celebrating the Christmas holiday all make for a delighful film. More delicious 1940's fashion.

The film I enjoyed the least was the 1938 version of A Christmas Carol. I'm devoted to the 1984 made for TV version with George C. Scott, so for me, anything else is sub-par. I found this version to be pretty cornball, and the only enjoyments for me were Leo G. Carroll as Marley's Ghost, Ann Rutherford as The Spirit of Christmas Past, and Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit, mainly because it was amusing to see him as a younger man. He's familiar as Judge Harper from 1947's Miracle on 34th Street.
But all in all, this was a great purchase! TCM does a great job of making film collections that are sure to entertain and cherish.",1388102400,,2441,4.711943793911007
7768585,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Great collection of old timey  movies.

Shop Around the Corner - The classic James Stewart movie they later modeled ""You've Got Mail"" after for a great storyline.
Christmas in Connecticut - Barbara Stanwick in her youth, had to rake through my youth to realize she was the matriarch of Dallas.  Classic and amusing story.

In the product description, the film summary for ""A Christmas Carol"" clearly states that this is the Brian Desmond Hurst directed version, with Alastair Sim for Scrooge. In great anticipation, I ordered this after hearing raving reviews of Sim's performance. I was disappointed when I opened it up and saw that it was Edwin L. Martin's version. Come on, people.

(Fun to see a young Don DeFore (""Hazel"") and Alan Hale (""Gilligan's Island""). Looking forward to ""Christmas in Connecticut"" next. Glad I got this and being exposed to these unsung Christmas movies. I'm not a fan of this version of A Christmas Carol, preferring instead the George C.

7768678,5,B01GWBZ3K2,I have owned each of these movies in VHS versions and was excited to see them consolidated into one DVD.  Takes up much less storage space and makes it easy to view without changing tapes all the time!  Great assortment.,1366675200,,220,4.475

7768680,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"The big holiday classics are always fun to watch: ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""White Christmas,"" etc. But some of the lesser known Christmas films are much better. Two of the best are in this set: ""Christmas In Connecticut"" with the incomparable Barbara Stanwyck and ""It Happened on Fifth Avenue"" with Charles Ruggles and the delightful Victor Moore. ""Christmas In Connecticut"" centers around an advice columnist (Stanwyck) who writes articles about her idyllic life in the Connecticut countryside. In truth, she lives beyond her means in a New York walk-up. When her magazine invites a young soldier, wounded in WW2, to spend the holidays with her, Stanwyck has to scramble to create the illusion of a life far from her reality. ""It Happened on Fifth Avenue"" tells the story of an aging hobo who moves into the home of a New York aristocrat assumed to be wintering with the wealthy in Palm Beach. Victor Moore plays the hobo, who is happy to share his opulent winter home with others having a rough time during the holidays. When the home's owners come to stay incognito, comedy and romance ensue. Both of these films are incredibly fun and worthy of being part of movie fans' holiday traditions.",1364083200,,1194,4.857843137254902
7768681,5,B01GWBZ3K2,I have a large collection of the Classic Christmas DVDs as well of the more recent Christmas movies.

7768736,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"The five-star rating is not mine alone. I gave this movie collection to several friends and they all loved it. In addition to Alastair Sims' Scrooge performance being universally acclaimed as the best portrayal in the entire Milky Way all the films have a solid, warm feel that is lacking in more recent efforts. My contemporaries - 60ish - loved it. Their grown children loved it. Their grandchildren loved it. There aren't many movie collections that three generations can sit together and watch without somebody going crazy This is one.",1359590400,,539,5.0

7768766,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Four wonderful films, featuring stellar casts.  I wish the films were as originally shown and not condensed, particularly The Shop Around the Corner; I'd rather pay a bit more and receive the entire movie.  I've enjoyed these four films sev eral times since I received them, and have shared them with friends and younger family members who are impressed with the acting, dialogue and peaceful plots.",1358467200,,399,5.03030303030303

7768800,5,B01GWBZ3K2,We love the classics because they still have Jesus in them & they don't have bad scenes or foul language. Love love love them!!!,1358121600,,128,4.375
7768801,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Far and away the best version of ""A Christmas Carol.""  Also, thought I didn't see it as a child I have become a fan of ""Christmas in Connecticut.""  The other two are interesting.  It is a rather quirky role for Jimmy Stewart and the Christmas connection is tenuous at best but good none the less.",1358035200,,296,4.345454545454546
7768802,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Great classic movies enjoyed by every family member!  These movies never ""go out of style!""  Highly recommend Christmas in Connecticut.",1357948800,,135,5.7
7768803,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"I only have watched one movie so far--The Shop Around the Corner--the original movie that inspired the movie You've Got Mail with Meg Ryan starring as the owner of her very own bookstore named ""The Shop Around the Corner,"" the British Comedy Series ""Are You Being Served"", and I believe  a 1940s version of ""The Shop Around the Corner"".  The only thing I disliked was the ""suicide attempt"".  I find movies featuring this and other negative aspects are responsible for the blood and guts spillage you see in movies today, video games, but the worst in every day life on the streets of America.  It actually turned me off, so I have lost interest in watching the remaining three movies.",1357862400,,684,4.675

7768805,5,B01GWBZ3K2,This is a great collection of old time films that will transport you back to the period.  Just be aware that its best to watch around the holidays.,1357516800,,147,4.25
7768806,3,B01GWBZ3K2,"Three stars for the packaging, not the films themselves.
I was happy to receive these 4 films, each on a separate disc, however I was very surprised to find them all attached to one hub, on top of each other in a stack.  Makes no sense to store them this way when there are cases available that will hold 4 discs separately and safely.  Very weird.  Plus, the description on the back of the case indicated that there were two double sided discs instead of 4 single sided discs, as described in the product information on Amazon.  Regardless, stacking 4 DVDs on top of each other is a sure way to end up with scratched discs.  Pretty lame packaging and not up to par with TCM's usual standards.",1357516800,2,693,4.3828125
7768807,5,B01GWBZ3K2,I bought this as a Christmas gift.  It was exactly what he wanted. He loves watching old movies on TCM and loves this DVD.,1357516800,,122,4.083333333333333
7768829,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"Bought these for myself this holiday season and was not disappointed.  A couple of these I had not seen, while the others are always enjoyable to watch again.  Today's movies are just not the same as yesterday's classic.  This collection will not disappoint.",1357430400,,258,4.953488372093023
7768830,5,B01GWBZ3K2,I love these holiday films very much and always have even as a young child.  So now I own them...,1357344000,,97,3.85

7768832,5,B01GWBZ3K2,I love getting film collections. I've enjoyed all the movies in this colllection. Usually there is at least one that's kind of blah but all four of these were really good and I look forward to watching them again next Christmas.,1357257600,,228,4.585365853658536
7768833,5,B01GWBZ3K2,There are so many years that I have waited to see my favorite holiday shows on TV and so many years I never got to see them.  That is why I purchased this DVD so I can see them whenever I want to.,1357257600,,196,3.558139534883721
7768834,4,B01GWBZ3K2,I gave 4 because of the movies being on both sides of the discs rather than single discs.  But I do like all the movies in this collection.  Great for the holidays.,1357171200,,164,4.09375

7768837,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"I've reviewed the four films separately so I just wanted to review this particular edition of 4 movies.
Here you have 4 classic holiday films, though I would not classify CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT (despite the title) and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER as Christmas films. In both films, Christmas is just in the background. Also included is a very classic edition of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, which has seen countless versions through the years.
There is something that adds to the delight of this 4 movie collection. It's the bonus features like a very young Judy Garland singing SILENT NIGHT or the thought-provoking cartoon PEACE ON EARTH. Classic film buffs will enjoy JACKIE COOPER'S CHRISTMAS PARTY. It's Jackie's birthday and he convinces Louie Mayer to let him have his party on a soundstage and who caters the party--some of MGM's biggest stars of the day including Clark Gable and Bette Davis. It's not to be missed.
It's nice to have 4 films together. They come on two double-sided disks. The problem here is the print is VERY small on the inner rim of each disk. You need good light and good eyesight to see which movie is on each side. I guess that is a small annoyance. The movies were crisp and clear and good quality.",1357084800,3,1221,4.683720930232558
7768838,5,B01GWBZ3K2,The best movies to watch while wrapping presents! Nothing disappointing here. All are winners! Possibly a favorite Christmas Carol. Must Have Christmas Classics!,1356998400,,161,6.043478260869565
7768849,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"My daughter loves old movies and has been looking for the movie, ""The Shop Around the Corner""....I believe it's the inspiration for ""You've Got Mail"", with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. I was very excited to find it and the added bonus is the 3 other movies that are in the collection. My daughter was SO EXCITED to receive this set for Christmas. ...Shipping was very quick, price was excellent. Couldn't be happier.",1356912000,,411,4.6438356164383565

7768852,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"They certainly added to our Christmas cheer. ""Christmas in Connecticut"" of course is a classic and enjoyable year after year. I had never seen ""The Shop around the Corner"" or ""It happened on 5th Ave"" and it was a nice treat to find a couple of old movies which are very entertaining. ""A Christmas Carol"" was also charming, even though it's well over 70 years since it had been filmed. The picture quality was very good (if you don't mind black & white). No complaints about the sound either. Sometimes the oldies are still the best!",1356739200,,532,4.552083333333333
7768853,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"I bought this for our Christmas movie collection and it is now our prized DVD. Four movies total on two DVDs. The movies are good, old-fashioned, time tested ones.

7768855,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"I bought this for the old version of A Christmas Carol. Wathing this one over & over on Christmas Eve was a tradion when I was a kid. Worth it to me just for that movie. I haven't watched the others yet, but the quality of A Christmas Carol was what I expected.",1356652800,,261,3.943396226415094

Christmas in Connecticut was good  as well as It Happened on 5th Avenue.  They are silly and predictable but they are also clean and enjoyable.,1356566400,,259,4.354166666666667

7768880,3,B01GWBZ3K2,"This collection is a mixed bag.  A Christmas Carol is very good.  the Little Shop Around The Corner is good,  but Christmas in Connecticut was disappointing.

The 1938 version stars Reginald Owen, and while a nice telling of the story, is not my favorite by far.  If you want the Alastair Sim version, and I think I would because it is simply the best filming of the story that has ever been produced, this is not the DVD for you.  You might have to search for the 1951 version under the title ""Scrooge"".",1355702400,7,467,4.2727272727272725

So each of the four films offers an enjoyable Christmas entertainment. There's not much by way of supplemental features -- but the Oscar-nominated ""Peace on Earth"" cartoon gave me a reason to cheer.

He was wrong.

I love the Alistair Sim version, but according to the DVD case, the 1938 A Christmas Carol movie included stars Reginald Owen, not Alistair Sim. Alistair Sim starred in the 1951 version. I was not happy. He also says ""Watch for Patrick Macnee (Steed in The Avengers) as the young Jacob Marley--the actor made his screen debut in this 1951 production."" 1951? this is a 1938 movie. Too bad Mr. Keogh mixed up the movies. I guess I should have looked up the movie I wanted to see. (P.S. I accidentally called the Alistair Sim movie ""Scrooge"" in my original review - sorry.)

7769017,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"I picked up the Christmas version of the two DVD set from Turner Classic Movies holiday collection.  This set collects Christmas in Connecticut, A Christmas Carol, The Shop Around the Corner and It Happened on 5th Avenue.

I've already written reviews on these four films generally.  Of the four, Christmas in Connecticut was the most humorous with Lionel Barrymore as the rich publisher and Barbara Stanwyck as the recipe columnist who gets caught making up her farm life with a wonderful husband and so on, when in fact she lives in a brownstone apartment in Brooklyn.

Shot Around the Corner was fun with Jimmy Stewart.  The film was remade twice: once with Judy Garland In The Good Old Summertime, and by Tom Hanks where email is used rather than pen-pal ""snail mail"" in You've Got Mail.  Stewart is not bad here, but he's done better with films of that period, It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

The worst of this quartet was It Happened on 5th Avenue and I just could not get into it.  You didn't feel a lot of sympathy for the characters as they squatted at a rich man's mansion, which rich man returns disguised as a bum and interacts with the characters.  It's certainly no Frank Capra!

A Christmas Carol, the 1938 version with Reginald Owen as the cranky miser, was not the best version of the Dickens classic by any means.  Much was missing from the original novelette.

A fun extra with the Christmas Carol film was a cartoon where the world is run by squirrels and rabbits who've made homes out of old battle helmets, for men have all died out!  Quite an anti-war film which was made just before the USA involvement in World War II.

There's a brief clip on the same special features area with Judy Garland singing Silent Night.  Not bad, but the sound quality was pretty bad for her great voice.

Another final feature was the Jackie Cooper Christmas Party.  I recall Cooper from his later films but forgot that he was also a child star.  In this party, MGM's stars come out and serve pumpkin pie by Bette Davis or get to rub elbows with Clark Gable.  It was a clear publicity piece by MGM.

All in all, not a bad quartet of films but certainly not a typical sampling.",1293148800,2,2205,4.52020202020202

7769046,5,B01GWBZ3K2,Four fantastic movies - classics all!  A great value at a great price.  Our favorite is Christmas in Connecticut; we watch it every year at Christmas.  All four are great family entertainment.,1265673600,2,192,4.9375
7769047,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"For anyone who loves the old Christmas movies, this collection is a delight! It has one of my all-time favorites, Christmas in Connecticut (1945 version) with one of the most talented actresses ever, Barbara Stanwyck! The Shop Around the Corner, stars Jimmy Stewart, you can't do much better than that for old Hollywood's great male actors! It Happened on 5th Avenue was a classic that I had never seen before, but was thoroughly charmed by! A Christmas Carol is my favorite Christmas story, and well this film (1938) is a shortened version of the story, it is still worth viewing! All in all, a fine collection that will put you in the mood for a warm and very merry Christmas!",1265500800,6,678,4.658333333333333

7769050,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"This is an interesting assortment of Christmas-related movies.  I was familiar with three of them already:  A Christmas Carol, of course, although this is not my favorite rendition, but it's A Christmas Carol, it's hard not to like it; The Shop Around the Corner is one of my favorites and I didn't have a DVD of this; and Christmas in Connecticut is a relatively recent discovery of mine (thank you, TCM) and it's got such a wonderful cast, headed by Barbara Stanwyck.  None of these are Great Movies, you understand, but enjoyable enough.  The fourth film, It Happened on Fifth Avenue, I'd never even heard of, much less seen.  Really, I would have been okay if I'd never seen it.  It has nowhere near the charm of the other films on these DVDs, although there are some good actors and a decent-enough script and direction.  For me, at least, the main character--the actor's name escapes me now, but he's the first character you meet onscreen--rubs me the wrong way and I found him to be quite unsympathetic, which pretty much ruins the movie.

But three out of four ain't bad.",1264464000,,1079,4.6421052631578945

7769052,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"I loved all the movies but to my surprise all the reviewers mention only four movies.  There actually are five!  Not a single reviewer mentioned the wonderful Oscar-winning short which is on the same side as ""Christmas in Connecticut.""  I had seen this 22 minute short on Turner Classic Movies several years ago and have been hoping to find it ever since.  The problem was that I did not remember the correct title.  Therefore, imagine my delight when I found that ""Star in the Night"" was the little gem on which I had almost given up.

Normally I would have given this collection 5 stars (and more if available) but that the whole collection is on double-sided disks is a serious drawback, especially since the back sides are not even marked.  That seems to be the height of chintziness.

If I could rate contents and format separately, I would give 5 stars for contents and 1 star for the way it is presented.",1263772800,11,911,4.54601226993865
7769053,5,B01GWBZ3K2,"All four of these movies are great holiday movies.  I had never seen Christmas in Connecticut or It Happened on Fifth Avenue and I was pleasantly surprised on both accounts.  A Christmas Carol is the best version that has ever been produced and The Shop Around the Corner is so timeless they keep trying to remake it.  I highly recommend this four pack.  The only negative is that I never know which movie is on which side of the DVDs, but it only takes a moment to figure it out.  These are total feel-good movies!",1263254400,3,515,4.378947368421053
7769054,4,B01GWBZ3K2,"This four pack of three Christmas classics and one lesser known charmer is a great replacement for VHS editions.  The sound and picture quality are very good, especially on Christmas in Connecticut and The Shop Around the Corner. The inclusion of the rarely mentioned It Happened on 5th Avenue was a nice surprise, with its' emphasis on the Depression and the impact on housing and labor. It's not quite as all round great as the others, but is a nice addition for those who want to add to their holiday collection. This is a wonderful set for the price.",1262563200,,554,4.595959595959596
