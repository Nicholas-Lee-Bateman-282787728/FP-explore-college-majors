4319963,5,B004BP79S6,Seeing this made for tv movie again was Amazing! I remembered it exactly as it was shown originally. great performances from the entire cast. This film is still available at 70s-tv.com if interested.,1293408000,3,199,5.0606060606060606
8422143,5,B004BP79S6,"Paul Michael Glaser's finest role! He replicates some of Houdioni's most amazing escapes, ably backed by such TV star notables as; Sally Struthers, Bill Bixby, Vivian Vance and Adrienne Barbeau! Based on the life and times of the great escape artists Harry Houdini, this TV movie presents a highly fictionalized version of Houdini's private life, but displays a relatively factual, accurate version of his public persona and his amazing escapes! A must for any Houdini fan's collection!",1470700800,,486,5.324675324675325
8422144,4,B004BP79S6,"Classic TV movie from the 70s starring Starsky. Pretty cheesy until the seance scene (and well, still cheesy then, but good). It's a rarity.

8422148,5,B004BP79S6,"I saw the original airing of this made - for - tv movie.

I watched EVERYTHING that I could find with Paul M. Glaser featured.  I am still a Starsky & Hutch freak fan!

I do believe that both he and Sally Struthers were very believable as ""The Great Houdinis,"" which is really a love story.",1375660800,2,290,4.142857142857143
8422149,5,B004BP79S6,"I was thrilled to find this movie. it romantised the life and career of houdini and his wife bess.
the movie follows the rise of his career, andconflicts with
his mother. it also takes a look at the supernatural.
Sally struthers plays Bess, Vivian Vance adds a wry sense of humor to lighten the mood, and Ruth Gordon hams it up as Harry's mother.
