8285444,3,B001C0I5Z4,"its really great looking at the early years with some fabulous clips of those old stars, it is at times a little repetitive when talking about stars like gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, but nonetheless some great moments. As it gets towards the present its like someone pushed the fast forward button, barely touching on ironical movies where there were in fact less movies to pick from than in the heyday of musicals, as repeatedly often mentioned yet movies were just headlined with no clips, just sound bites and commentary from the various random 'historians' ... I think this is really disappointing because it's a real miss to show the evolution of musicals with society, and perhaps introduce new musicals to another audience.",1432512000,,727,4.967213114754099

8285447,5,B001C0I5Z4,Not a lot is written or shown about the musical era of Hollywood anymore. This DVD shows current movies to the days gone by.,1388361600,,124,4.208333333333333
8285448,5,B001C0I5Z4,This is one of the best musical docs I have ever seen!  You will keep this and play it many times. A GREAT buy!,1344297600,,111,3.625
8285449,5,B001C0I5Z4,This was an amazing movie especially for musical theatre and movie musical fans.  The clips are great as are the interviews.  Enjoyed the special features too and Shirley Jones tells fabulous stories.  I could have sat for two more hours and watched more.  Looking forward to a sequel sometime in the future!  Loved it!,1311120000,,319,4.833333333333333
8285450,5,B001C0I5Z4,"A wonderful overall history of music and dance in the movies.  My only complaint would be it's too broad a subject to be covered in just 2 discs.
I especially enjoyed the interviews.",1245283200,,182,4.515151515151516
8285451,3,B001C0I5Z4,"Sorry, but this is not a five star product.  It has many fine moments, but it races through the 1930's, and there is about thirty seconds or less of Fred Astaire dancing with Ginger Rogers.  There are no scenes of Astaire in the 1940's, and only the number from Royal Wedding where he dances on the ceiling is shown from the 1950's.  It is inexcusable to virtually ignore Astaire in the 30's and all of the 40's--his RKO musicals in the 1930's with Rogers saved the studio and were break throughs in the genre.  There are plenty of good scenes and interviews, but almost ignoring Astaire brings my rating down, and deservedly so.",1231113600,12,629,4.539823008849558
8285452,5,B001C0I5Z4,"I saw this film when it played at the Palm Springs Intl. Film Festival (where it was a Best of the Fest selection). It is really fun and very entertaining. I'm not really even that into musicals but I love movies and Hollywood history so I checked it out. After I saw it I wanted to rent a ton of these movies by people like Busby Berkeley, Vincente Minnelli, Gene Kelly. Plus it reminded me about great stuff in the 70s like ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Saturday Night Fever."" It even has clips from last year's ""Dreamgirls.""

This documentary has long clips from all kinds of musicals, photos of the production of the movies, interviews with all kinds of stars and directors, I really liked it.",1217980800,22,694,4.464566929133858
8285453,5,B001C0I5Z4,"I was lucky enough to see the premiere of this film at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood.  The best way I can describe it is pure joy.  All of my favorite musicals were here and a few I've never heard of (of which I promptly rented and loved - The Harvey Girls is the die for).  I adored the interviews and the behind the scenes footage (Sound of Music and Funny Girl anyone???).  What I like most about this DVD is that it has the Q&A session with Shirley Jones and director Mark McLaughlin at the premiere I went to.  I kept thinking, ""I wish I could have a copy of it.""  Well now I can.  Here's the content of the bonus DVD I grabbed from their website:
