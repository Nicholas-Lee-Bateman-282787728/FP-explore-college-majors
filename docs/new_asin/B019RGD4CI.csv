7581049,5,B019RGD4CI,"I have been waiting a VERY long time for this film to be released on DVD - and here it is!  This is the movie that made me fall in love with horses when I was about four years old.  Anyone who's every dreamed of making friends with a wild animal will adore this movie, even if it was done in 1958 when movie-making (especially Westerns) had a 'serial' filming style to them. It was a true 'family affair' - written, directed and even starred in by (members of) the McGowan Family - and the theme song that plays throughout the film is one my siblings and I still sing (we grew up watching this on ""Family Classics"" broadcast on WGN-TV out of Chicago on Sunday nights).  Young Molly McGowan lives on a ranch with her father, Mike, and her sister, Melody.  Her father (and the other horse ranchers in the area) have been trying for years to catch the wild white stallion, Snowfire, but none of them have been able to.  After eluding one of the new ranch owners, Mike catches Snowfire, but Molly releases him when Snowfire 'tells' her all about his family and how much they need him and will miss him.  It is a film of action, adventure, misdirection and mystery as the adults vie with this young 8-year old girl who befriends and allies with the bold, white stallion in a quest for the freedom we all long for - and the kind of friendship and loyalty we all dream about as children - and the Young at Heart....",1459728000,5,1408,4.3143939393939394
