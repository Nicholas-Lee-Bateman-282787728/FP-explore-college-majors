8194697,3,B000Q6QCO6,"My daughter and I watched the movie right after reading the book.  I think we were disappointed about some of  the differences from the book (parts left out).  Also, it's a pretty old movie, so it just felt a little dated/dull compared to current movies.  It was OK, but not a favorite. (This review is about kavik.  We haven't watched the other movie in the package yet).",1386720000,,372,4.492537313432836
