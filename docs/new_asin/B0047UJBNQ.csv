Left an east-cost small town for S.F. in a quest for love, Anthony found himself trapped into delusive affairs with a mentally challenged partner, found an odd job and met a much younger street-wise hustler Gavin just for adding to bitterness of an unsatisfaction overwhelming.

In spite some very generally-screened pillow exercising, this film is rather a philosophically-boring drama of solitude so common between all genders and sex preferences round a globe.",1414368000,,485,5.368421052631579

It is February 8. Anthony (Raphael Barker) has moved from Virginia to San Francisco, California. He is trying to get over his relationship with Steve (Scott Cox). On the telephone, his grandmother tells him she will help him pay his way back to Virginia if he needs to.  Tonight, Anthony has company, he met a street kid, Jeff (Travis Romo), and has invited him over. The kid tries to get comfortable and starts asking questions. Anthony really doesn't want to talk about his roommate, Nancy (Goldie Chen) and doesn't want to talk about the man in the photograph, Gavin (Adam David). Anthony will only say, he is gone. Then Jeff says the old lines, ""I'm getting hot in here"", ""Maybe we can find a way to cool down"", ""Would you like to help me out?"". Anthony tells him to stop and that this is all wrong. Jeff asks him if he should leave. The next scene shows them having sex. For Anthony, it is meaningless with no feelings. For the street kid, it is just business. Anthony pays him.
  Later, Anthony eats cold pizza and listen's to his nice grandmother's message, but quickly deletes it. He doesn't care. He listens to a message from Gavin. he doesn't care either.
  The next morning, Anthony is back on the bus remembering all that happened to him this year.
  Now the film takes us back to one year earlier, when Anthony first arrived on the bus from Virginia into the Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco to be with Steven.
  The story jumps around his time with Steven, living with Nancy, when he met Gavin and the one-nighters he had.

4285507,4,B0047UJBNQ,"This tells the story of Anthony (Raphael Barker) who has met a guy in the shape of Stephen (Scott Cox) and has decided to upsticks from Virginia and travel to the gay Mecca that is San Francisco and live with his new boyfriend. Anthony is an `aspiring poet' and so therefore unemployed so is virtually dependent on Stephen. Whilst things go well at first Stephen has past issues that have caught up with him and he is a classic case of having to hurt the ones you love.

His violent and possessive swings in mood mean that before too long it is impossible for Anthony to remain. The story is told in flash back and has a time line that appears at the bottom of the screen to ensure you are not missing the importance of exactly when things are happening. We see how Anthony has so much to learn from the big city and he befriends Gavin (Adam David) a seventeen year old run away and street wise hustler. They form a bond that is more caring than the one he has/had with Stephen. Along the way there is a host of characters that bring the story to life.

This is a slow paced film with a minimalist approach to film making. I can not remember any background music for instance. There is extensive use of the shaky camera approach which always lends itself to realism/docudrama. But it also goes some way to making a somewhat drab scene be filled with more animation. This, as a device, is used to great effect as part of this story is the crushing loneliness of being in a big city where the one person you thought you knew and could trust, turns out to be a controlling egomaniacal bully (that is not a plot spoiler by the way). There are some very awkward scenes and the need for true friendship is at the core of the tale.

This is not a sex fest either, there are a number of bed room `grunting' scenes but it is actually done in a realistic yet surprisingly tasteful way.  Also all of the actors come across (no pun intended) as being very real, they actually have body hair, which makes a pleasant change (unless its one of those rare `bear' movies that is). Even though this is slow paced, there is enough drama to keep you hooked and actually want to know what happens next. It also avoids all of the movie clichs both in terms of the relationship narrative and the whole street hustler thing too. So as a debut effort from writer and director Scott Boswell I feel he has done an outstanding job. If you are a fan of gay and moreover independent cinema then this is one you will want to see - recommended.",1331424000,5,2512,4.315677966101695
4285508,3,B0047UJBNQ,"Others have provided the basic plot. I did not find the film very satisfying.  To me, the constant time shifts (also mentioned above) seemed calculated to provide weight or complexity to an otherwise rather thin and simple story---they were confusing and added nothing to the movie except annoyance.
  Two-thirds of the film dealt with a dysfunctional relationship, and the back-and-forth between those two characters (ex-lovers??) got old fast---as a viewer you had to suffer with them, when most people (most viewers) would have quickly cut their losses and moved on (and away from both of them).  For this reason I had trouble giving them much sympathy, and yet most of the movie kept these guys in your face.
  The more positive relationship, between one of the lovers and an attractive, charismatic street kid, was not fully developed and this, too, worked against full emotional investment in the film.  This kid's actions seemed almost random because we were told (and shown) so little about him. The ending seemed somewhat out of character for this kid in light of his newly emancipated status, but hey.  I felt the film had the potential to be a lot more interesting than is actually was.",1309910400,7,1197,4.95
4285509,4,B0047UJBNQ,I really liked The Stranger in Us. The casting was interesting and the story was something we can all relate to sometime in our life. I would like to hear what other think.,1306886400,,172,4.242424242424242
4285510,5,B0047UJBNQ,"Days after watching  writer-director Scott Boswell's first film effort, it still resonates with me. Well written characters present a story of profound simplicity regarding attraction, loneliness, commitment and the various complications. A fine cast is on hand to deliver the goods, and Mr Boswell has a good handle on what he's trying to convey. The shifting time-frames may seem confusing,  but it doesn't take long to know Anthony so well that it all falls in place. The beginning and end are solidly in place, and if there's confusion in the middle, it all makes sense in the end; the viewer can figure it out if you pay attention. Indeed, Raphael Barker's Anthony is multi-layered and completely presented with dignity and integrity. Scott Cox' Stephen is also multi-dimensional, though his reality isn't as well-explored. Especially good is the enigma of Gavin, an amazing and confident performance by the very handsome Adam Perz, a kid experienced well beyond his years. Anthony's dilemma is whether he wants to be controlled by one or the other. He's smitten by both; it's really about control, whereas Anthony is very much of a free-thinking individual looking for a mutual relationship. The DVD extras are plentiful, including Mr Boswell's delightful Indie short film ""One Fine Morning"". I recommend this film mostly because it's non-judgmental and brutally honest and sincere. Films regarding gay society are too often laden with stereotypes; temper tantrums or other similar histrionics.  Mr Boswell told his story simply, without sympathy. The character of Anthony is a sort of Everyman, and the whole experience was satisfying, at least to me.",1305417600,8,1658,5.249056603773585
4285511,4,B0047UJBNQ,"The Stranger in Us is a great story of a young man trying to figure out is life, and while moody and poetic, the film keeps a truthful edge that never veers into indulgence.",1303689600,4,173,4.117647058823529
4285512,5,B0047UJBNQ,"""The Stranger In Us"" is a smartly written and poignant look at three inter-related gay male characters in San Francisco. This is a gritty and tough film, but one whose central character, played with great depth and emotion by Raphael Barker in another fine performance, has an internal center of well-meaning goodness. The two supporting actors also perform quite ably and much of the script has realistic and thoughtful dialogue and scenario. My one problem with this film is that it is so non-linear in time that I found it confusing. My partner and I had to keep turning the DVD off to figure out where in time we were. There are dates used, but I can seldom remember a film with so much discontinuity time-wise. Some more careful editing could help. I could have knocked  off 1 star for this but it doesn't stop the film from registering emotionally and having an impact or take away from the story itself and its fine acting.",1299888000,11,930,4.636363636363637
4285513,4,B0047UJBNQ,"San Francisco is the melting pot that ingests Anthony, Stephen and Gavin. Stephen (Scott Cox), in his mid-30s, is a fragmented surface on which a battle is waged between an urge to control and the will to be dominated. On a business trip to rural Virginia, he met Anthony (Raphael Barker), a sensitive writer in his mid-20s.

Anthony's romantic idealism drove him to follow Stephen back to San Francisco. His passivity simultaneously attracts and repels the unstable Stephen, creating turbulent and aggressive relations between the two. When this coupling inevitably combusts, Anthony's fragility turns to apathy - although in a foray of aimless night-time encounters, his paths crosses with those of Gavin (Adam Perez), an enigmatic 17-year-old hustler.

THE STRANGER IN US unfolds without linear narrative: various scenes interject themselves without any chronological foundation, almost as if they were being reconstructed by the vagaries of our memory. Consequently, there are moments of anguish juxtaposed with humor, sensuality bearing wounds, naive bliss and bruised pleasures. The strong cast and fresh dialogue work together to forge a unusual collective yet solitary intimacy.

Writer/director Scott Boswell - in this, his impressive debut feature film - confidently creates an intriguing assemblage of churning sensibilities. Not for those who seek their reflection in a fairy-tale, the aptly-titled THE STRANGER IN US is otherwise a quietly thoughtful collision of ambiguous passions and irreconcilable identifications.

Extensive DVD extras include a behind-the-scenes feature, an alternative ending, deleted scenes and Scott Boswell's short film, ""One Fine Morning"".",1296950400,10,1680,5.762096774193548
8418344,3,B0047UJBNQ,"It's the idiotic timeline that ruins this movie. It is very hard to follow, and keeps doubling back on itself (or so it seems). This COULD be a very great movie with compelling meaning, but it all gets lost in the timeline translation. As with a lot of these types of movies, it's filled with things that don't make sense. Anthony can't afford a bus ticket, yet suddenly moves into an apartment on his own (working a minimum wage job) in the most expensive city in America. His roommate is there for window decoration, as she simply disappears forever and he can have anyone over anytime he wants. And what's up with grandma? That subplot is interesting but in the end has nothing to do with what's going on. Acting is great, however, so the characters are very believable.",1524268800,,773,4.568345323741007
8418345,5,B0047UJBNQ,"Original, clever, story told in an effective way. What other reviewer might see as fragmented, I saw as an accurate portrayal of life. It doesn't fall into clearly defined segments. I also thought the ending was perfect. This wasn't meant to be a start to finish story but a just a chapter in the main character's life. I get tired of the same old, same old. I like movies that are refreshing different in how a story is told.",1518048000,,426,4.405063291139241

The basic plot of the movie is a die hard romantic (Anthony), moving across country for a guy (Steven) whom he thinks he's in love with...but finds out that he is controlling and manipulative.  Like any good movie...you introduce an unsuspecting hero...in this case, Gav, an underage runaway with a heart of gold.  The story line between Gav and Anthony was very sweet.

The video quality wasn't the best, I was able to get past that...but the sound...especially towards the beginning was awful.  The writing was a little weak...especially for Steven.  To me, he didn't fit the role or the dialog.  The actor who played Gav did an excellent job...and I think he carried the film.  The chemistry between Gav and Anthony was very believable...but the chemistry between Anthony and Steven was very forced and unbelievable. on so many levels.

I also had a very hard time following the ""timeline"" flashbacks.  I think flash backs can add a lot to a movie....but in this case, the entire movie takes place in less than an 8 month period...so it was very hard to keep up with what was present and past.  I think this movie was supposed to be set in pretty recent times...so I was surprised to see so much use of pay phones in this movie...(I can't remember the last time I saw one...let along three!...lol).

This movie had a lot of potential...but just fell short.  It's a movie I'm glad I watched...but not one I'd watch again.

Bonus for me...was this was filmed in the SF Bay Area...my home...so it was nice seeing familiar places in the film...and the Oakland scene was an area I've been to quite frequently.  And yes,  a mugging in that area would be totally believable!  lol",1496534400,,1686,4.661016949152542

8418352,1,B0047UJBNQ,"Over written and under acted. The script sounded like a high school creative writing exercise --- one that the author flunked.
The lead had the emotional range of a rotting peach. I'm sure he's a nice man and I'm hoping he's actually a good actor -- but this wasn't a good vehicle for him.
The only actor who didn't immediately telegraph every scene was the kid who played Gavin. He was worth sitting through this movie.",1460764800,,420,4.5394736842105265
