6031482,3,B00FUABJMS,"Ok well, this series is fun to watch sometimes but a classic it is certainly not and even more so neither is the price of this 6th Season from Amazon. Forty bucks perhaps, close to what Amazon's other sellers have it at. I can and certainly will wait until prices drop. I've had enough of pre-ordering a program (example, The Naked City Complete series) which I paid $99 for, and only 4-5 weeks later seeing it drop and hover between $74 to $80.",1389744000,3,445,4.373493975903615
6031483,5,B00FUABJMS,"This was the BEST series on T.V. in the sixties and seventies. Finally, it's on DVD and we are lovin' it!",1389744000,4,105,4.0476190476190474
6031484,4,B00FUABJMS,"Another show I really like, I will say that have improved the quality of the making MOD since the first FBI's came out. The quality is sound is much better but again, not totally cleaned up. Also I am glad that they put in one volume, and last they are better secured. There is no way to see what each show about and what guest stars in that show. They on them on the cover but there is no way of knowing until you start watching the whole show. Considering the price we paying for this season. Look forward to season 7, if it's not already. All the shows are 5 the rating is based on the issues.",1389312000,,596,4.059322033898305
6031485,5,B00FUABJMS,"The FBI  was always one of my favorite drama series. Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. one of my favorite actors. I read he recently turned 95! He must have great genes in his family!",1388016000,7,170,4.3125
6031486,5,B00FUABJMS,EACH EPISODE IS A GEM...I'VE BEEN COLLECTING THE FBI FROM SEASON ONE......AND EACH AND EVERY EPISODE IS JUST AS EXCITING AS IN SEASON SIX......IF SUSPENSE AND EXCITEMENT IS WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR IN YOUR TELEVISION SHOWS THIS SERIES HAS IT ALL......EFREM ZIMBALIST JR. STARS IN EACH EPISODE AND HIS ACTING IS FIRST RATE......THIS SHOW CAN'T BE BEAT....,1387843200,10,351,5.175438596491228
6031487,5,B00FUABJMS,Another great season of the fabulous FBI series. Definitely worth buying. Bring on the rest of the seasons please ASAP,1387238400,9,118,4.95
6031488,5,B00FUABJMS,BEST EVER  great  I want season 7  if there is one  fantastic---the same 5-6-7 actors play bad guys in all the episodes,1384992000,4,119,4.2727272727272725
6031489,5,B00FUABJMS,"With this release, the good folks at Warner Archives are well on-track to release the rest of the series.  Forget about those dowdy 70's fashions----This is quality programming at its best!  From the days that scripts actually required ""sweat"" to be produced and executed. If you have not seen the FBI with Efrem Zimbalist before, or have just seen one or two episodes---Season 6 is a great season to jump back in.  My teenagers were glued to to the screen as they watched the first episode of this season.  Evidence that a quality production is timeless!  Good job Warner Archives!! Thanks for keeping quality programming alive.",1383609600,15,629,4.89622641509434
6031490,5,B00FUABJMS,When you view this program it is very easy to see why it lasted for nearly a decade.  The episodes will keep you on the edge of your seat  with all of the action.  The F.B.I. was also a program where new faces could be seen at times and the regulars were also great as well.  Be sure you buy the entire nine seasons f this classic T.V. show.  It is a great program from an era of television that is gone forever these days.,1434931200,,423,3.929411764705882

6031496,5,B00FUABJMS,One of the best tv series ever. It was nice to see them all again and watch something where there are no personal backstories which go on forever. Each episode is a stand alone entry.,1417219200,,183,4.257142857142857

8618640,5,B00FUABJMS,"Great to see and hear the orchestration of 60's TV production again, and you can't get much better than this program. True stories not necessarily based in violent crimes where the FBI chases suspects around the nation. Really good solid entertainment.",1501891200,,252,5.170731707317073

8618642,5,B00FUABJMS,"However, I have experienced some problem with one of the disc's in the pack with my dvd player reading one disc for some reason.",1486512000,,128,4.375
8618643,5,B00FUABJMS,"Can't get enough of this well-produced crime drama. As with other seasons, really excellent remastering (even going back to Season 1 in 1965). When I was a kid, we used to argue (we had the one TV set) on Sunday nights about to watch Ed Sullivan or The FBI. I guess you know where I stood (no disrespect for the iconic TV host). Our compromise came from the logic of watching reruns (I actually wrote down the titles of episodes we watched so no one could say 'we saw this FBI already! OK....I was nuts, but it worked.)
Season 6 is one of the sets that contains the full season which is the right way to sell these. It was on for 9 seasons! We're not all millionaires. I am a Vic Morrow (Combat!) fan and in the event you are as well, Seasons 6 & 8 both have Vic as the guest star.
I thought the late Efrem was always tops as Insp Erskine. And if you're reading this, maybe you thought so too. Rest in Peace, Efrem.",1453075200,,915,4.11731843575419
8618644,5,B00FUABJMS,"Once again first rate writing and quality episodes for season 6 along with a great list of guest actors..Stuart Whitman is excellent as a real creepy con man who preys upon wealthy women in the episode ""The Impersonator.""...Great character actor Monte Markham plays a cold calculating escaped con on the run along with a young Billy Dee Williams in ""The Architec""...Just hearing the opening musical theme and the voice saying ""The FBI a Quinn Martin production"" brings back memories of Sunday Nights and gets me ready for another entertaining suspenseful episode.",1448409600,,563,5.197802197802198

8618646,4,B00FUABJMS,"THE DAMAGE TO THIS PRODUCT CASING HAS STOPPED ME BUY FROM AMAZON 2eric.richards@gmail.com

Congratulations i-parcel what a big twit you are, This DVD arrived a day early to what the Email said , but the corner of the DVD case was broken loose, as it had been sent in cheap bubble type post bag. Been 9  by 11  inches manufacturer code B2A, the bubble type is so cheap you can not burst the bubble when you press it with your fingers. Unreal I got two DVD's out from the UK a few days before  because New Zealand has some cheap worthless classification system, they can not market DVD other than Region 4 DVD. Anyway those two DVD's came in post in a one layer corrugated cardboard box similar to how Amazon send their DVD and both DVD arrived in mint condition.  I would love to get more of The F.B.I. series DVD but it is not doing my bank saving a good turn especially when the top left corner of the case is broken.  Otherwise I would of given this product a five star rating.

Anyway it is great putting this amazon purchased DVD in a region 4 DVD player and been able to watch this great entertainment software been true stories and not the dribble free-to-air TV offer.  Just after I paid for this sixth season FBI series I put all region DVD into Amazon search engine, and got a list of DVD I have absolutely no interest in all on buying as I would most likely have to learn some other Asian language to enjoy it.
My suggestion is Amazon should make this as a feature on their website so when website visitors go for the the All region DVD's option instead of art, automobile, baby, beauty, books, etc or have ""Movies & TV by region"", titles like The FBI will come up instead of thekung fu type rubbish, to make it easier for out of region 1 DVD people to make a DVD purchase, and if I ever saw WKRP in Cincinnati on that list I would be keen to purchase that DVD as well.

What brilliant entertainment, stories that do not have any deaths (killing) in them (unbelievable), I can see one reason why they do not re-screen them on today's television. Not only that they do not ram the camera into the players faces all the time and switch cameras faster than you can blink. You do not get sea sick watching them the camera work is rock steady.  No visual special effects bull to cover the wool over your eyes, just  true to life stories. What a shame the case was broken, it has made me reluctant to buy more in a hurry.

FOOTNOTE:
Interesting I have never heard any feedback from Amazon.com on the damaged goods or the help to buy all region DVD from their website, and I don't give a hoot if this in not resolve I will not buy again from Amazon.com.
Many years ago I brought a cheap product from Amazon. UK the post & postage cost a arm + leg, it never got resolved Amazon. UK have lost out on hundreds and hundreds of dollars on lost sales  I gave to other UK DVD retailers.",1436313600,,2882,4.246800731261426
