8496066,5,B006BGGU4C,"Great respect for Boris Karloff making a movie about drug addiction back in the day when it really was not discussed. It's a scary movie first, but I felt the drug addiction aspect was more the more important theme. It's very sad because Karloff plays this doctor who is a surgeon in the days when there was no anesthesia at all. So the only mercy a surgeon could show was his speed in cutting off or out whatever needed excising. Karloff tries his best to crest a gas that will knock people out during amputations and whatnot. Unfortunately he experiments on himself after a humiliating mishap in the operating theatre right in front of the best doctors around...and he gets addicted to his product. Then comes the downward spiral. But I found this movie extra moving because Boris Karloff was friends with Bela Lugosi who was a morphine addict. Doctors had prescribed it to Mr. Lugosi for pain from a old war wound so he could keep working. But when it was discovered he'd become an addict he was not allowed to work anymore. That's Hollywood for ya.",1468800000,,1052,4.601063829787234

 ANYONE who goes to see ""Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory"" deserves exactly what he gets. To give you an idea, this gory mess of pottage from Britain has a jumping rock 'n' roll theme song titled ""The Ghoul in School."" Oxford, watch out! Rather surprisingly, the first quarter of the second item on this ""horror"" DVD bill, is pretty good. The title of this one is ""Corridors of Blood."" For a while it suggests those gaslit melodramas of Old London in the early nineteen-forties, starring Boris Karloff, as happens here. Horror they had, also a serious, underlying purposefulness.

""Corridors"" starts with Mr. Karloff, as an altruistic surgeon determined to prove, through experiments, the existence of anesthesia.

Opposing him are some selfish, bigoted colleagues. Some dregs of Old London are also blackmailing the poor guy, whose only aim is to benefit mankind. This portion is forthright, picaresque and carries ugly conviction, and Mr. Karloff is a persuasive, if lamblike, protagonist.

Then the film turns into a plodding, shuddersome exercise in blood and pain. It's the old one-two, strictly for the sake of shock. That's the bargain in store for any customer lured by the pair of titles.",1392163200,,1236,5.068965517241379
8496070,4,B006BGGU4C,"In my opinion this one of Karlof's best films. The subject matter is somewhat believable and interesting. If you like Boris, science and crime you'll love this.",1390089600,2,160,4.962962962962963
8496071,5,B006BGGU4C,"A beautifully restored black and white classic film by DigicomTv. Excellent audio and video quality. A must see for the entire family!

The story begins with a prominent surgeon in 1840's England who is determined to perform painless operations by finding a way to anesthetize his patients while performing amputations. Boris Karloff gives an extraordinary performance as Doctor Bolton, and is a kind, compassionate doctor who treats hospital patients as well as the poor and indigent.

Dr. Bolton continues his search for the exact formula to produce an effective anesthetic, experimenting on himself. Eventually, the doctor becomes addicted to his own inhalation of chemicals used to produce the anesthesia, and begins to lose his credibility and expertise as an eminent London surgeon. He eventually finds himself in a crime-ridden and disreputable area of London known as 'Seven Dials', where people are purposely being murdered so that their bodies can be sold to the hospital for money. Dr. Bolton soon resorts to these thieves and cut-throats to provide him with the chemicals he needs to continue his anesthesia experiments by writing fraudulent death certificates for those who are being murdered in 'Seven Dials'.

Needless to say, poor Doctor Bolton is in a downward spiral of addiction, and the necessity to procure the drugs he needs to continue his experimentation. It is clear what sort of demise Doctor Bolton will arrive at if he continues down this desperate path, but watch the ending to see how things may actually come right in the end.

A really great story which leaves you guessing as to how anything good can come of this tortured Doctor and his well intentioned experiments to make human operations painless. There is tragedy mixed with hope in this film, and it is certainly well worth the viewing. Boris Karloff is at his best in this role, and exhibits a wonderful and convincing performance throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think you will, too!!!!",1381363200,5,1995,5.110429447852761
