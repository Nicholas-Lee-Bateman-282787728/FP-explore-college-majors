188097,2,1570762902,"My expectations that this DVD would more fully address training methods - primarily use of the hands and body positions were not met. I was disappointed that this was more a glossy exhibition of him working with different horses and never showed the step by step process of how he achieved the end results. While I would definitely not rate this as a training video, I would say that it has some nice philosophy and wisdom and displays some interesting horses. I saw nothing in this video for the avid horseman looking to improve his way with horses and for this reason I'm not certain that it held great worth in a serious horseperson's library.",1174003200,21,646,4.626086956521739
188098,3,1570762902,"the way this film is shot is weird.  They do a lot of slow motion takes and it's a bit over-stylized.  It interferes with learning his method of communicating with horses.  Much of the film is of him explaining his philosophy, which is fine, but it left me wanting more of him actually working with horses.  He really has a gift; I just wish he would share it with us in a more comprehensive way.",1170720000,14,396,4.24
7797171,2,1570762902,I had really hoped that this would show the relationship of a given body language to a horse's response. A lot of advertising and little practical exhibits.,1517961600,,156,4.814814814814815

7797173,3,1570762902,"Hempfling is amazing and has a very deep understanding of horses. I picked up a few things from watching this DVD, but I would recommend reading his books as well if you're aiming to use his methods yourself, as he goes more into depth about his techniques there.
I enjoyed watching this and I found it helpful. But it would have been nice if he made a DVD where he explains the basics of his work in a more simple, step-by-step way.",1398729600,,433,4.2926829268292686
7797174,5,1570762902,It was very helpful. Many things are not found in other videos. I wish it was longer. Very interesting how he got the animals to behave in such a short amount of time.,1396569600,,167,4.090909090909091
7797175,1,1570762902,This used video is corrupted and will not play in DVD player.  I tried some friends DVD players with the same non play/corruption results.,1369958400,,138,4.75
7797176,5,1570762902,Hempfling is one of the greatest horsemen in the world and perhaps the absolute best.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to build a deep and lasting relationship with their horse,1328400000,3,189,4.7272727272727275
7797177,2,1570762902,Pretty horses but  very basic and not very informative. I was disappointed in the content from an educational point of view.,1317081600,4,124,4.904761904761905
7797178,5,1570762902,"Thank you last reviewer, I was just about to not buy this dvd when I read yours.
You gave the review the dvd needs to someone who only saw this guy once and fell in love with his methods.
Thanks much",1283644800,7,199,3.8780487804878048
7797179,3,1570762902,"I give this video 3 stars because what Mr. Hempfling is showing us is awsome, but the video is way too short and he does not show how he gets from A to Z.  It would have been great if he would have taken one of those stallions and shown how he worked him from start to finish.  Instead, you just see clips - granted he is showing you the body language he is using, but in order to put it all together, it would have been nice to see it all.",1280793600,17,440,3.7717391304347827
7797180,5,1570762902,"I don't get it. Why are people saying this isn't a training dvd? Or that it's just a lot of artsy stuff that doesn't teach you anything? Are you kidding me?

EVERYTHING that Klaus is saying...if you just take the time to LISTEN, to HEAR what he's saying....you will learn exactly what you need to know to Understand your horse.

and THAT is better than any regular training dvd that just tells you, do A then do B then do step C....because frankly, most of those ""training dvds"" don't bother to tell you the psycology behind the moves....

If you don't understand WHY, HOW, and the true use of body language...the language of the horse, then you can do all the steps you want, but you simply will reach a point where you won't be able to go much further....because you can get your horse to do what you want most of the time....but you'll still have some issues...

Until you understand how to COMMUNICATE with the horse using your body and your energy and your mood. Yeah, your mood plays a big part in training.

If you want the gravy for your potatoes....this is it.

Klaus takes the time through slow motion parts in the video so that you can SEE exactly what he's talking about. If all the video is in present time and there's no slow motion, you will miss what he's talking about. So, that's the reason behind the slo mo stuff. It's totally necessary.

If you don't ""get"" this video, then sadly, you won't ""get"" horses.

If you are serious and open-minded and want to ""get"" your horse, truly ""get"" your horse....then this video will definitely put you in a different level, a higher playing field than the typical training dvds.

HIGHLY recommended!",1275091200,60,1655,4.526845637583893
