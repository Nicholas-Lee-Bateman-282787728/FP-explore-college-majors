4983821,5,B006CTKYPE,I SAW THIS ON NETFLIX AND LIKED IT SO WELL I BOUGHT IT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF DEADMAU5 BEFORE,1352073600,,91,3.6
4983822,3,B006CTKYPE,"This was a great tour, I saw it live and absolutely loved him. But whoever edited this thing should be fired.

The first time I saw Deadmau5 it absolutely made my jaw drop, the visuals (at least then) were like nothing I'd seen before, and the music is of course fantastic. And that's what she be focused on! Probably 50-60% of the footage on this DVD is of crowd shots, and it jumps every 4-5 seconds, like the person editing it has bad ADD. It really doesn't give you a feel for what a Deadmau5 concert is like in person, because in person you don't want to look away. There are so many little details of things going on, and you miss some much of that in favor of watching some people jump around and cheer. Why would I want to see them?

If you have never seen Deadmau5 live, don't watch this. If you have and want to get a live DVD of him, get it used. It's worth a watch, but don't let it spoil a first time experience.",1336521600,,925,4.104972375690608
4983823,4,B006CTKYPE,Liked the song choices & all of the visuals but the camera's focused too much on the crowd instead of the amazing set up he had on stage.,1335484800,,137,3.9285714285714284
4983824,4,B006CTKYPE,Love deadmau5 and this DVD though not the best picture quality on a 1080p Television don't get me wrong its still good just not as good compared to other. The songs on here are all great deadmau5 tunes and i love listening to it more then watching it!,1332720000,,251,4.25
4983825,3,B006CTKYPE,"I was really excited when this DVD was first announced, because number one, it would give mau5 a chance to redeem himself after the atrocity that was the Earl's Court DVD, and number two this was the tour I saw him on.

The footage itself is much, much better than the Earl's Court DVD.  Looks like the cameramen actually knew they were filming a concert and not a random mass-collection of people.  The setlist, audio quality and video quality are also much better.

What really disappointed with this DVD is that many songs are edited short or were even cut out all-together.  WTF (To Play Us Out) and Limit Break were completely cut out of the DVD, and Where My Keys, Raise Your Weapon, Some Chords and many more were cut short.  The most obvious point in the film where this is notable is during Reward Is More Cheese, the film literally just cuts right into Some Chords, skipping WTF entirely.  Also, language was censored (As can be noted during Sofi's stage banter and during Professional Griefers.)  I mean I understand more and more kids are getting mau5 now, but that's no reason to create huge gaps in the music.

I also feel that there were quite a few camera angles that were missed out upon.  Namely a shot of inside the cube, showing all of his equipment.  There is an angle from behind him that pops up rarely throughout the film, but it's just his head and nothing more.

Oh and the iTunes version for whatever reason doesn't come with extras which I'm way bummed about, but I know that has nothing to do with Amazon so I'll shut up.",1329177600,22,1550,4.476868327402135
4983826,3,B006CTKYPE,"This video shows WAY too much of the crowd, the drop of a song will come on and it will be showing the crowd who will usually just be waving their hands... It is infuriating the amount of time this DVD spends on the crowd. I want to see his fantastic light show, not people waving their hands, people sitting on other peoples sholders, not some idiot sticking his tongue out at the camera.. In addition to this, they do stupid movements with the camera or move it too close to the stage in a lot of scenes and it makes it really hard to enjoy how awesome Deadmau5's concert really is.

I have to say I am really disappointed with this DVDs camera work, it was like a 10 year old with A.D.D chose what cuts to put onto the DVD...

On the bright side the audio quality is a HUGE improvement from the last DVD.",1329004800,12,807,4.13375796178344
4983827,5,B006CTKYPE,"I'm a deadmau5 fan and have been ever since first hearing him on my XM car radio about three years ago. I've purchased and reviewed all his major albums (Random Album Title, For Lack of a Better Name, 4X4=12). In my opinion, Joel Zimmerman (aka, deadmau5) is a virtuoso musician whose choice of instrument is the computer. He's won major awards and if you wonder how such a young artist (about 30) can do such a thing, just give one of his albums (especially For Lack of a Better Name) a listen and you'll understand.

In reviewing one of his albums, I mentioned that I had never attended an electronic music concert and probably wouldn't do so in that I was 75 and such concert audiences were dominated by 20 and 30 somethings. My walker would interfere with all the dancers (just a little joke, folks). But, to be more serious, it's a music of young people and very few 70s people would even be listening, let alone attending a deadmau5 concert. Well, excellent music is excellent music and the age of the listener has nothing to do with it, giving a willingness to listen. Young people are more willing to listen and enjoy. One of my readers sent me a note to the effect that deadmau5 was appearing in San Diego at Soma (a local night spot). I looked it up and tickets were available. I sought out a companion, but then the concert was cancelled. Later, I found that it had just been moved to Petco Park, the baseball stadium for the San Diego Padres. I considered it, but decided I didn't want to attended a concert in a baseball stadium. Alas, I understand I missed an excellent concert.

Just recently, I discovered that deadmau5 had an available DVD of the ""Meowingtons Hax 2kll Concert in Toronto."" I had to have it! The DVD arrived yesterday and provided the evening's entertainment. The concert was excellent to watch and listen to. It was a long concert and had 25 selections. I immediately recognized about half and they were shortened versions of his stuff available on the CD albums. The songs were seamed together such that it was an almost continuous stream of music. The ecstatic fans raised their hands and swayed, pumped their fists and bobbed their heads. Joyous smiles were everywhere. The concert was held in a cavernous auditorium and I can't even estimate how many people were there, but it must have been well  over 10K. An impressive light show and video display accompanied the music and added to the viewing pleasure. The concert-hall acoustics were reasonably good, but added a little ""flavor"" to the music. For a purer listening experience for deadmau5 music, I'd suggest going to the albums. However, the DVD added the live concert feeling and that made the experience worth-while in that sense, It was a long concert and the audience held up well and begged for more at the  end. If your a deadmau5 fan, you've just got to view this wonderful DVD concert experience. I give it my highest recommendation!

4983828,5,B006CTKYPE,"An amazing account of an unbelievable night! The quality of this production is absolutely perfect! If you watch and listen to this and still need convincing? Well, you might just say you are ________  mau5",1328832000,,205,4.857142857142857
4983829,4,B006CTKYPE,"Finally, a great Mau5 DVD!
The audio quality is A+! (phew); great performace, and song selection. Still a few things that 'urk' be about some of the production stuff that i'll never understand; like why it's never possible to have a static stationary view of the FRONT of the stage?! there's SO much going on! Also, there was another anlge (which is probably the only thing i liked about live @ Earls) that was beside him, near his nobs and hands, inside the cube, that this DVD kinda lacked. You never really knew what he was going back there.. :( I still think there's too much 'audience time' and not enough awesome Mau5 show, but maybe thats just me being a mau5-brat. Still, i thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and am able to finally bring a memory home with me of an incredible night (yes, i was there!). Conclusion: way better than 'Live @ Earls', still no great inside-cube Mau5 shots, not enough extras, fantastic show with great songs (some unreleased! )- and you can tell he was very happy to be there-  definitely 'a keeper'!  Never miss the opp to catch him live! videos will never do him justice  Youre the man, Joel! Keep up the good work -Xavier (from Miami)",1328745600,8,1168,4.5260663507109005
4983830,1,B006CTKYPE,"I have ordered this product twice and both times the CD was ""blank""!!!!  I would not buy this product again.  It was very unusual because I have 6 other Deadmau5 CD's and I love them.",1409875200,,183,4.2
4983831,4,B006CTKYPE,I ordered it for my brother. He loves it n so do I. Great price n choice for a gift for him.,1406851200,,92,3.227272727272727

4983833,4,B006CTKYPE,"Saw this concert in Houston, Texas and this DVD recaptured the energy of his music as if it were live.  Sound was good, but a little disappointed.  I give it a 4/5.  Any EDM or Deadmau5 fan will appreciate this item.",1402185600,,216,4.219512195121951
4983834,5,B006CTKYPE,Love this concert! Excellent sound and video!  But don't be fooled by the case dimensions- this is not a cd recording of the concert- this IS the concert on DVD!  Besides that misunderstanding- I love this concert!,1388707200,,214,4.756756756756757
4983835,5,B006CTKYPE,Great dvd. Love deadmau5. Would tell my friends about him. His music has a great beat to it. Love love love it.,1377216000,,111,4.090909090909091

4983837,5,B006CTKYPE,"DeadMau5 is the freshest most inovative band in decades, and if you haven't seen the live show, it's free on demand on most cable systems.  The ""Floor Show"" is NOT to be missed. Pref under the influence of psychotropics!",1366416000,,220,4.641025641025641
4983838,5,B006CTKYPE,"I saw this on Netflix and wanted it right away. It looks and sounds even better on DVD. Nice live vocals and overall a collection of his better stuff. The visuals are stunning and the crows is crazy huge. Maybe 20,000?",1363392000,,218,4.341463414634147
4983839,5,B006CTKYPE,Excellent production on and excellent show in his hometown.  Sofie stuns and it's 2 hours of power.  You'll like it.,1355529600,,116,4.75
8496616,4,B006CTKYPE,"Great movie for any Deadmau5 fan, but I agree with the other reviews in that I would have liked less coverage of the fans and much more screen time for just Joel doing his thing! :)",1526601600,,181,4.055555555555555
8496617,5,B006CTKYPE,Works Great!,1498780800,,12,5.5
8496618,5,B006CTKYPE,"First the negative of the disc itself: it is DVD format and not Bluray.  Bluray would have been an epic release format.
The positives of the disc: for a DVD format, the image is among the best DVD images I have seen. It is on par with Superbit releases.  The audio also is outstanding. The format is Dolby Digital in 5.1 and the mix is superb through the majority of the show.

The show itself was fantastic. If you are a Deadmau5 fan, then this is a must own title. Where the show is concerned, I thought that they could have mixed up the camera angles - near the end of the show, the fans lucky enough to be filmed repeatedly were running out of steam.  Also, I think the addition of gogo dancers on the edges of the floor space would have made for even more fan energy.",1469923200,,772,4.1610738255033555

8496622,5,B006CTKYPE,"I DARE YOU, to remain still in your seat while watching this. It is almost impossible to do! Yes, too many crowd shots and nit-picky this and that. In the end, I don't even care. This is awesome and enjoyable to both watch and listen to, and that's what really matters. RECOMMENDED for all Mau5 fans. If you're not already in that crowd, you might be after seeing this. Sheer lighthearted enjoyment.",1426032000,2,399,4.555555555555555

8496624,5,B006CTKYPE,"We were first introduced to this show and deadmau5 on NetFlix. It was discontinued there so I bought this dvd about a year ago, have watched it more times than I can count and can't imagine the day when I reach my saturation point. Joel is an incredible performer and it is clear that the audience comes first when he entertains. The only thing I wish they had done is focus more on him and his show and less on the audience. The quality of the recording is great. Since we can't afford to trot across the globe to see him in person, this was clearly the next best option!",1422057600,,572,4.209090909090909
8496625,5,B006CTKYPE,Very good show. Wished I could have been there. Sound and video is excellent.,1420329600,,77,4.571428571428571
