4284092,5,B0047BXQZY,"Errol Flynn was one of a kind; devastatingly handsome, yet self-destructive, gifted at nearly everything he tried, yet so insecure that he could never acknowledge nor accept his talent. He mastered and became synonymous with the swashbuckler, yet he appeared in more westerns and war films than 'sword and tights' adventures (and truthfully, he disliked most of what he made, in ANY genre). In many ways, his tragic vices aside, he was really a little boy who never grew up, who needed love, took criticism too hard, and was suspicious of praise. Yet most remarkably, of his generation of stars, he is one of the few whose name hasn't faded into obscurity, since his death. Errol Flynn has remained an iconic star, the personification of a laughing cavalier, heroic and confident, and TCM has brought together the BEST of the best, with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Greatest-Classic-Film-Collection-Legends-Errol-Flynn-The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood-Captain-Blood-The-Sea-Hawk-Adventures-of-Don-Juan/dp/B0047BXQZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Errol Flynn (The Adventures of Robin Hood / Captain Blood / The Sea Hawk / Adventures of Don Juan)</a>

In editions filled with terrific additional features of the era of each film, these four titles bookend Flynn's 'glory years', from his explosion onto the scene as physician-turned-pirate Peter Blood in Michael Curtiz' ""Captain Blood"" (1935); his pinnacle as Warner's biggest star, in the ULTIMATE swashbuckler, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938); one of the most beautiful historical romantic adventures ever filmed, ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940); and his 'Golden Age' swanswong, ""The Adventures of Don Juan"" (1948), which, while not the last of his swashbucklers, would be the last big-budget 'studio' production, as years of carousing and self-abuse had begun to wear down his features, and drain his energy. The swashbuckling Flynn of the 1950s would only be a shadow of the past; his brief future belonged to a sadder, darker soul, in richer, more contemporary roles.

This is a 'Must Have' collection for any Flynn fan!",1300838400,47,2165,5.80503144654088

Men respected and women swooned over the many heroic characters Errol portrayed.
In the era when men were men and women served their men and household, these romantic and mature movies caused many to flock to the movie houses for more of the character building and awe-inspiring releases the Golden Age of Movie Producers gave us.
I was hooked on these movies at an early age.. They gave me the impressions a young boy needs to become a man.

TCM is attempting to create a movie event as it was in the 1930's by including newsreels, small featurettes, a musical number, movie preview and a cartoon. In addition to the high quality DVD transfer, of these 4 Flynn movies the post interviews on each of them movies are well done and worth watching. The packaging is adequate with 4 disks on a single post. But at $12 I cannot complain, since it is much cheaper than purchasing each of the movies separately.",1487635200,,586,4.59047619047619

4284139,5,B0047BXQZY,"Errol Flynn in the best of his 'swashbuckling' roles.  ""Captain  Blood"",  ""Robin Hood"", The Sea Hawk"", and ""Don Juan""
These are such fun movies, the hero almost always gets the girl, always duels the bad guy, and usually by his side is Alan Hale Sr. with his charming humor.  What more could you ask for?
Robin Hood is the absolute classic here.  A glorious romp thru Warner Brothers confused English history.  Claude Rains  and Basil Rathbone as the bad guys.  (Rathbone was considered the finest swordsman in Hollywood, so why did he lost so many times to Flynn and Tyrone Power?)
The only dull one here is the 1948 Don Juan.  Quite frankly, I just don't see the appeal of Viveca Lindfors in her role here, although all the other conquests by Don Juan are of lesser beauty.  But watch Captain Blood of 1935, Flynn's first starring role, then the Sea Hawk of 1940, both directed by Michael Curtiz and you can how Flynn honed his acting talents, not just the swashbuckling and coy smiles, but when to hold a beat before a line, how to stare into the face of the enemy.",1468972800,2,1068,4.487046632124352

All are enjoyable, but agree with critics that the first movie, Capitan Blood --introducing Errol Flynn to the pirate genre--is the best executed.  Next best would be Don Juan--Errol showed his humor here and the storyline was fun look at a classic story.  Enjoyed the Sea Hawk for the exchanges between Errol and the lead 'bad guy'.  Robin Hood is a classic, of course.  The movies all have little extras, one of which explains that the same supporting cast played in almost all Errol's movies (thought they looked familiar!) due to Hollywood contract system and his preference. The collection would have been better if it had included Errol Flynn's movie with Bette Davis (private lives of Elizabeth and Essex)--that would make the collection complete.  Actually, could have replaced Sea Hawk with that movie....",1438300800,,920,5.093333333333334

4284233,5,B0047BXQZY,"I purchased this collection for ""The Adventures of Don Jaun"" because I owned all the other movies, but it was a easy decision for me to pick this set up, because everything that was offered was not widescreen & why not back up my collection as this set was the cheaper of the two!  I have found myself searching these TCM sets for films I am interested in because you get so many extra's it definitely makes you feel like you got a good bargain! Many of the extra's & shorts are not available anywhere else! Oh & by the way this is a great collection of swashbuckler's!!! Every film in this set is great fun for lovers of the clashing of stele!!! Being a swordsman the exaggerated movements make me chuckle but I understand how theatrical sword play must be over exaggerated for the layman to make sense of what is going on. I have been studying true swordsmanship which is roughly 500 years removed from Olympic fencing & worlds away from theatrical sword play but I did see Errol Flynn incorporate ""The Scratch"" a sneaky move banned from Olympic fencing & immortalized in Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet when ""Tibalt the prince of cats"" (a epithet earned by his notorious use of the scratch) slays Marcucio Whipping his sword around Romeo's body & into Marcucio! ""Tis but a scratch, not as deep as a well nor wide as a church door but ask me on the morrow & surely you will find me a grave man indeed!""

One of my favorite scenes is in The Adventures of Robin Hood when he swings on the vine, landing on a big rock and saying - Welcome to Sherwood!

They simply don't make actors like Errol anymore.  The actors today are nothing but paper cutouts.  Errol was the real thing.  Along with the likes of Bogie.  Bacall.  The Duke.  Liz Taylor.  Rhonda Fleming.  John Garfield.  The glorious Lana Turner and so many more.

For those who like swashbuckling high adventure and romance, placed in an historical context, these four movies are I feel as good a collection of action movies as one could see. Errol Flynn, as always is great. The look on Errol's face, the glint of his eyes, and the flash of his sword, and you know there is adventure. In Robin Hood, the splitting of the arrow and winning the tournament is a true action highlight.",1372809600,,500,4.693181818181818

And, also arguably, no Robin Hood since has quite equalled the magic of Errol's.  By the time he made Don Juan, the years and his life style were taking their toll.  The magic was gone.  Still, 3 genuine classics out of 4 ain't bad.  This is a must for anyone who enjoys old fashioned swashbucklers.",1367193600,,468,4.511904761904762

Four of his greatest swashbucklers and do not kid yourself, he was not wasted as he grew older as people claim. Check one of his last movies- Don Juan- and he had developed into a fine actor with a twinkle in his eye as if to say he had done it all and he was still good at his craft. Many thanks to TCM for issuing these sets for the future generations to see what personalities were really like and how charismatic they all were.

I watched Robin Hood last night and you know I really enjoyed the movie, I haven't seen it for a good number of years.  I guess I have mellowed with age as I found him endearing in this movie.  I was of two minds about ordering this set of Errol Flynn movies, but am very pleased that I did.  I think I would have regretted not having this selection of movies in my collection.  Will watch the other three movies with great anticipation and I know now enjoyment.  If you like the older movies you will not be displeased with this set.

4284371,5,B0047BXQZY,"Talk about a Boys Own collection. Three classic Flynn films that, apart from Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirate, define the swashbuckler genre. And the last of his main roles in Don Juan. A star who epitomised male sexuality in the 40's - 50's these films are politically incorrect and all the better for it. Simpler times, not necessarily better, but much simpler. Ok, double sided discs don't thrill me, but the movies are in good condition, clear and with numerous extras, and you simply cannot go wrong for the price. I would suggest buying the special edition of Robin Hood however as it is superb. Aside from the afore mentioned Crimson Pirate, the Flame and the Arrow, and Tyrone Powers movies Mark of Zorro and the Black Swan, these Flynn movies are THE swashbuckling adventures that Johnny Depp and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise grew from. They are superb. As for Don Juan, I haven't watched it yet - it simply came with the others as part of the package.",1348963200,,975,4.674418604651163

4284373,5,B0047BXQZY,"I was amazed by the great scenes in these films, whether they be castles, battle scenes at sea, or the jungles of Central America. These stories are action-packed with ships attacking at sea, intense, romantic, and intelligent. The collection comes in four individual discs.

The stories of The Sea Hawk (1940) and Don Juan (1948), besides being romantic, also involve a great deal of political intrigue. The Sea Hawk comprises the period of strained relations between Spain and England just prior to the defeat of the Spanish Armada (this event is not part of the movie). It has an interesting Queen Elizabeth, comparable to the one in the 1999 Elizabeth movie, a multi-dimensional character who must struggle between doing the best for her people, and sustaining peace because of economic convenience. The actress Brenda Marshall plays Flynn's love interest albeit the action and intrigue downplay the romance here. Don Juan encompasses a period where there are good relations between England and Spain, the setting is in the Spanish castle, since Don Juan is Spanish, and the conflict is with a close adviser to the Spanish King who wants to become king by waging war on England. This film makes a good balance between romance, action, and political intrigue. I find Viveca Linfors delicious in her role of Queen Margaret of Spain. I can never get tired of watching her. She is Don Juan's true romantic interest in this film. And I love that last line: ""My dear friend, there's a little bit of Don Juan in every man, and since I am Don Juan, there must be more of it in me!""

Captain Blood (1935) is another romance and Errol Flynn's first leading role, this time dealing with internal political intrigue in England. A doctor gets unfairly arrested and tried as a traitor for aiding an opponent to king James, who is the bad guy here. The doctor becomes a pirate later and finally he is part of a restored order in England under King Williams of Orange. Blood's romantic interest is played by a vivacious and charming Olivia de Havilland. This film also has intense battle scenes between ships, slave rebellions, and swashbuckling between Flynn and Basil Rathbone. The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) is the most popular of these films. Olivia de Havilland plays Mariam. When Richard the Lionheart is imprisoned in Austria, his brother wants to take over England and impose unjust taxes, particularly among the Saxons, and Robin Hood, of course, is opposed to these injustices. He does everything to antagonize the impostor king, wins an archery contest, escapes a prison, leads a rebellion, swashbuckles with Rathbone again, helps restore the Lionheart to his throne, and stays with Olivia de Havilland. I know... I spoiled this last film. But even if someone told me about it, I wouldn't miss watching it because the fun is in watching these great spectacles with great drama, great acting, and great action.

Michael Curtiz (director of Casablanca) directs three of these films, and Don Juan is directed by Vincent Sherman. Erich Wolfgang Korngold did the incredible musical score that accompanied these films, while Max Steiner did the same for Don Juan. The films of Robin Hood and Don Juan are in technicolor, while Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk are in black and white. But every film was well done, and was fun to watch.",1342051200,26,3331,4.892035398230089

4284376,5,B0047BXQZY,As a kid I watched Errol Flynn as Robin Hood many times on Family Classics on Sunday afternoons. Years passed and then I stumbled on this while searching on amazon.com. ABSOLUTELY fantastic!!! All four movies are wonderful -- what a treat. Robin Hood/the Sea Hawk/Captain Blood are still so entertaining -- I even saw my kids slowing down to watch and finally collapsing on pillows on the floor. Though remakes over the years as well as take-offs have been entertaining and memorable for their own special effects these old films from a much simpler time hold up very well. This is the first time I watched Don Juan -- wonderful. Turner's group did a great job of colorizing Don Juan and Robin Hood -- but to be honest I never missed the color during those early years. These DVDs will make an appearance often on those rainy days in Spring and frozen afternoons of Winter.,1327881600,,873,4.638709677419355

4284382,1,B0047BXQZY,"What a rip off. Great movies, but the cheapest of presentations. Be aware these are the delicate and easily damaged double sided dvds, 4 movies  2 discs. Captain Blood{1935} and The Sea Hawk{1940} are in their original B&W versions. Errol Flynn is unparalleled as a swashbuckler and the film quality is very good, especially for a 1935 Captain Blood. I have the colorized version of The Sea Hawk on VHS and it's superior to the B&W version for a costume drama. If you have been looking to collect the colorized versions of these two movies in DVD, this again is NOT it, even though TCM had these and other movies colorized and continued to broadcast them into the 1990s. Colorization then fell victim by becoming ""unpopular"" ie unprofitable due in part to the film purity movement. The TCM DVD cover deceptively exhibits color images for each movie. The source is unknown, but Amazon lists the Format: COLOR, DVD, NTSC as of this review. It is far better to have these 2 movies in B&W than not at all, but if the Warner Bros studio could have afforded to budget costume dramas in color, it would have{aside from the re-use of old B&W stock footage issue}. Colorization makes an acceptable substitute for costume dramas. Purchase was made in 7/2011. Robin Hood{1938} and Don Juan{1948} are in Technicolor.",1312934400,12,1304,4.769911504424779
