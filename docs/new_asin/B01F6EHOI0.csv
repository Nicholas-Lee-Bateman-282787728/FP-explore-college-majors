7749136,5,B01F6EHOI0,A great show for whale lovers and anyone who loves nature. I saw it in an IMAX theater but now I can study it at home.,1472342400,,118,3.576923076923077
7749137,4,B01F6EHOI0,"I am crazy for humpback whales, and also for 3D blu-ray. This is a product for me. The movie is good, the footage is very good, though I guess I was hoping for something a little more impressive. The footage is lovely, perhaps the best yet, but it doesn't change the game the way Planet Earth did for its genre, and I guess that's what I was expecting from an Imax 3D production. If you're well versed in humpbacks and their behavior, you won't learn anything new from this film. But you will see great footage.",1471478400,9,511,4.333333333333333
7749138,5,B01F6EHOI0,"The Humpback Whales DVD is amazing, stunningly beautiful and a spectacular educational ocean adventure. For the first time in IMAX, it offers an up-close look into the incredible lives of humpback whales by a team of researchers.

What I particularly like about this show is how much fun information you learn about humpback whales. For instance, did you know that humpback whales can weigh 50 tons, be longer than a 50 foot school bus and have a wing span greater than most Lear jets? Or, that they can dive to the depths of 1,000 feet in the ocean and migrate up to 10,000 miles round-trip every year? And, did you know that male humpback whales sing?
Sadly, we also learn that for hundreds of years and up until the 1970s, humpback whales were killed for their oil. Fortunately, because of the generous support of the Pacific Life Foundation we are learning the importance of the humpback whales and the importance of protecting them.

My favorite thing in this show is learning that the male humpback whales communicate through song. Their songs are known as the Music of the Deep. It is also what motivated countries across the world to form a ban to stop the killing of humpback whales in 1978. Up until this time, these marine mammals were becoming extinct.

This film is wonderfully narrated by two-time Golden Globe nominee Ewan McGregor and produced by Academy Award nominated filmmakers at MacGillivray Freeman Films. The accompanying music is moving and sets the mood perfectly. I also loved seeing the beautiful scenery as we follow a team of researchers journeying into the waters of Alaska, Hawaii and the distant stunning islands of Tonga.

The message of this film is that humpback whales should be protected, respected and asks what can we do to help them survive. So what can we do to help? Glad you asked. The film tells us that this is possible by encouraging ships to slow down or be re-routed and to keep trash out of the ocean. However, there is also a life moral message about how it is our turn to be the guardians of these magnificent creatures.

The Humpback Whales DVD is a wonderful, educational, ocean adventure for both children and adults. Young viewers will enjoy the beautiful scenery and more mature viewers will appreciate the many amazing things there are to learn about humpback whales. The DVD includes a special feature by the films director who discusses the making of the movie which you won't want to miss. I recommend this for ages 5 to 18 and give it five out five stars. I hope you watch this DVD so you too can experience the magnificence of humpback whales.

7749176,3,B01F6EHOI0,"A documentary about humpback whales can never be a bad thing. This film is a typical 40-minute Imax documentary, complete with celebrity narration. As with most Imax films of this sort, you get a mixture of message (a good one certainly) about conservation and vigilance for keeping whales safe, and some excellent footage of whales. I would have liked to see a little more whale footage, but thats a minor complaint.

My main issue with this Blu-ray is the music and the mix/balance of music versus narration. Less problematic and more simply annoying is that some of the music in this thing is just kind of insipid. The more classic orchestral score bits in this film are nice, very reminiscent of other nature films (think something like the emotionally manipulative yet excellent Crimson Wing score), but the awful acoustic indie music (greatest day of my life, etc.) is pretty grating.

But far more problematic is the mix/balance of the music in comparison to the narration. This Blu-ray only has one English soundtrack, a fancy 7.1 Dolby Atmos soundtrack. Perhaps it sounds impressive hooked up to an Atmos-enabled 7.1 setup. But many folks listen to Blu-rays downmixed to stereo on their TV/display. This is where the Blu-ray becomes nearly unwatchable, or rather unlistenable for lack of a better way to put it. The music is literally TEN TIMES louder than the narration. There are numerous times where Ewan McGregors narration, already kind of low and mumbly, becomes literally buried underneath the music. Several minutes in, I literally had to turn the subtitles on for the entire film. I know my setup well, so this was not an issue with my BD player or display. I listen to countless Blu-rays downmixed to stereo (5.1, 7.1, Atmos, etc.). Theres definitely something wrong with this Blu-ray; I sense perhaps they didn't do any compatibility testing to hear what this sounds like downmixed to stereo. I get it; they have to justify selling a mere 40-minute Blu-ray by at least upping the audio resolution. But its quite disappointing. Ive e-mailed Shout Factory about this and haven't received a response.

Curiously, the music vs. narration balance is not an issue on the alternate language tracks. I can listen to pristine FRENCH narration. Probably no coincidentally, the alternate audio tracks are of course not Atmos tracks, which may explain the normal balance found on those.

I have probably several thousand discs in my collection including nearly 1,000 Blu-ray discs, and this release has probably the most problematic audio track issue Ive ever contended with. Id give it zero or one star were it not for the amazing majesty of humpback whales. I still enjoyed this quite a bit. I just had to use subtitles.",1475539200,12,2730,4.967177242888402

7749178,1,B01F6EHOI0,"This is about the film. Not Amazon.

I love nature films. Then I saw this one and it was...meh. Over produced with too much of that annoying music ""The greatest day of my life"" and it was too loud! ARRGH! Worse was Ewan McGregor's fake giggle. I mean, really? I thought this was going to be ""Planet Earth"" quality. It's not. For me, a total waste of time.",1472515200,4,355,4.220588235294118
