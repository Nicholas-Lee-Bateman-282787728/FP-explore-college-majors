7750059,5,B01FIVQGUI,This was a very difficult film to watch.  I have been a Chet Baker fan since I discovered jazz.  His addiction to heroin is the ever present core of this film and it covers in detail his last hurrah before moving to Europe where he would eventually die.  Ethan Hawke presents a most convincing Chet Baker and is the consummate fallen angel who cannot seem to get away from his addiction.  Highly Recommended.,1469923200,10,408,4.5479452054794525
7750060,4,B01FIVQGUI,"Baker was one of the fresh faces of jazz in the 50s, and he had demons. A cheeky white boy famous for sweet-sounding cool jazz, he had a hard time earning the respect of giants like Miles Davis.

Oh, he also was major heroin addict.

The movies plot primarily deals with Bakers return after getting his teeth broken over an unpaid debt, but much of what happens after that is fictionalized. Robert Budreau, who writes, produces AND directs, bases Born to Be Blue on a true story, the teeth being broken, but he takes many liberties with it.

And thats okay, because biography is boring, and here, while the central narrative deals with Bakers comeback, the larger story, the one really used to create the portrait of who Baker actually was, is about love.

In the beginning, Bakers positioned as a bit of a Lothario, living loosely and dangerouslydrugs, fame, sex; it all happens very fast. But then, his love interest in a movie hes starring in about himself, Jane, played by Carmen Ejogo, winds up falling for him (partially because he won't stop coming on to her).

After the assault, the movie inside the movienominally about his previous strugglesgets canceled, and hes suddenly back at square one. Jane helps him, but his comeback turns out to be much harder, more difficult than Bakers Wikipedia entry seems to indicate. When hes finally ready, hes faced with a series of pivotal choices. The consequences affect his life forever.

As Baker, Hawke is phenomenal, playing him as a romantic idealist, recalling his performance in Richard Linklaters 1995 cult classic Before Sunrise. And Ejogo, too, is stellar; she plays Jane as her own kind of tragic case.

There is a real chemistry between the two actors, and the story benefits from their constant interplaytwo dreamers, pushing themselves, willing themselves, driving themselves, in the face of what appears to be undeniable failure. Hers at the hands of time; his at the hands of heroin.

I couldn't say for sure that Hawke plays the junkie role that well, because much of Born to Be Blue deals with a period of time when Baker is not on the stuff. But in the moments that heroin factors inand these are very key moments he does give Baker an anxious twitch, a frenetic dont-trust-this-guy kind of sensibility. You feel like he might fold over and die right on the screen. Or at the very least rob you before he does so.

What I most especially liked about this film was it does not drown itself in explanation, as most big-budget Hollywood films tend to do. Perhaps owing to its small aspirations, it jumps right into the story and uses the movie-within-a-movie plot device, plus flashbacks, to kind of get you up to speed on Bakers whole deal. Its less biography than character study, and thankfully, you don't feel like the actors are talking at you for 90 minutes straight; nor are they talking among themselves.

Born to Be Blue is a delightful little movie and I highly recommend it.",1469836800,,2950,4.755381604696673
7750061,4,B01FIVQGUI,"I had to take my anti-depression pill to counter act the story. Baker was a low key guy and so was his trumpet playing which I liked.
Ethen Hawk did a great job playing Baker and the rest of the actor's were at the top of their game too. Kevin Turcotte was excellent
in his emulating Baker's trumpet style. This film was good enough for me to keep. I recommend Baker's cd;Chet Baker in Milan.
In that cd He's excellent. Him and the Italian Saxophonist's play mostly Jazz standard's;LADYBIRD,PENTUPHOUSE etc.
Very good movie. P.S. If you want to see the REAL CHET BAKER check LET'S GET LOST documentary.

7750062,5,B01FIVQGUI,"Born to Be Blue stars Ethan Hawke as Chet Baker, one of the most famous jazz trumpeters in the world, known as a pioneer of the West Coast jazz scene and an icon of cool jazz. By the 1960s, years of heroin addiction had left his career and personal life in shambles. The film deals with Bakers attempts to extricate himself from addiction and start a life with his actress girlfriend, Jane (Carmen Ejogo), an amalgam of several women from Bakers life.

Writer-director Robert Budreau sets his tale in 1966 and imagines what it would have been like had Baker succeeded in cleaning up his act. This half-tribute, half-speculative biopic provides a multi-faceted portrait of Baker, whose influence on jazz was major. Rather than tell the story chronologically, Budreau starts the film midway through Bakers life, after he has served time in jail and is hoping to revive his career.

Baker was a white musician in an era dominated by black musical geniuses and was frequently shunned by them, including Miles Davis (Kedar Brown). Hawke accomplishes the difficult task of making an unsympathetic character sympathetic, and manages to capture the forces pulling at Baker  his love of music, dependence on drugs, and longing for recognition in the jazz community. He also does his own vocals. Music lovers will relish the soundtrack, which is composed of some of the best jazz standards of the time.

Special features on the DVD release include deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes making-of featurette, and theatrical trailer. The movie is widescreen and rated R.",1469404800,,1554,5.05859375
7750063,3,B01FIVQGUI,"Real talent always flourishes, but then there's the type that promises more than they can fulfill. Chet Baker (Hawke) is one of the best trumpet players in the world. He has played with Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis and can hold his own. After getting out of jail he attempts a comeback. Movies and music come back easy to him, until his drug habit takes over and everything he knows and has is threatened. This movie has two things going against it right off the bat. First, it comes out shortly after the Miles Davis movie with Don Cheadle. Second, this person is not nearly as well known as Miles Davis was. That said, I still like jazz and bio-pics so I was hoping this would be good. It is hard not to compare the two movies since I just saw the other one last week. I thought Miles Ahead was a little better, mainly because it seemed to move a little faster and there was more than just this happened to him, and then this happened. Neither of the movies however were amazing or classics along the lines of Ray or Walk the Line. What this movie had was terrific acting. I have never been a real big Ethan Hawke fan, but I really think he could get a nomination for this one. He is the reason to watch. Overall, a decent movie about a person I had never heard of but became interested as it went along. Hawke is the real reason to watch though. I give this a B-.",1469404800,,1369,4.229007633587786
7750064,5,B01FIVQGUI,"Well, this movie was very calm and felt like the director's 100th movie, meaning it was so well made.
The film flew so well and there is nothing to critisize about deeply.
The song, music is so well arranged and Ethan Hawke was so very perfect for the roll.
He was for the first time the very Chet Backer himself.
No one, I mean no other human creature can do that roll better then he does.
I mean it.
Also the roll of the wife done by Carmen Ejogo was very convincing as well.
She has this very charming look which is not all pretty but somewhat make us feel make her lovable all over.
All the other casting were good. The father of the Carmen the wife, the father of Chet Baker himself.

There are two unforgettable scene I should talk about.

One, when he had a comeback and sings/plays in a place with his wife present.
It was dark and everyone were totally obssessed by his voice and his trumpet. They were like worshipping his sound.
He's got the sound of a god!
You know before this movie I always had this huge doubt.
The fact that he is white and all, you see, I am all about West coast jazz although I love Paul Desmond, Stan Getz, Bill Evans (EAST COST JAZZ BUT WHITE) Dave Brubeck, Gerry Mulligan and so on, I still love East coast musicians more and that is because they have this true blood, sweat and tearse in their music which white people cannot have. All they have is note, money and education.
But sorry I was wrong, when I heard Ethan Hawke(CHET BAKER) playing the last song when finally his wife giving up everything to come and listen to his perfomance- she gave up her really important acting part- I was totally sucked into his moment.
I was almost crying the whole time during him singing/ performing his trumpet.

Gee, you are a romantist.

It is sad that because of that moment, he lost his wife and went back to drug area stays in Frence for the rest of his life.
For so long he was able to be sober without drugs but that one time I couldn't play with that stupid little heroine because he was afraid of Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie present in the seat watching him playing without his wife.",1467244800,,2124,4.28927680798005

7750066,4,B01FIVQGUI,"In terms of cinematic approach, there are some very unique shots. Love the opening & ending.

In terms of story, that is more of a philosophical question. When dealing with biopics, what is your goal? Fairy tale narrative structure DOES NOT fit in REAL LIFE SITUATIONS. Read that again.

Both leads did an excellent job portraying this story, and the Director did an excellent job displaying the West coast.

Watch this movie for yourself, and please give me your opinion. Thanks.",1464134400,6,480,4.901234567901234
7750067,3,B01FIVQGUI,"There is a trio of biopics about troubled musicians out right now, and what's fascinating is how they are all presented differently. One throws clich out the window completely, another goes the standard by-the-numbers biopic approach, and finally there's Robert Budreau's ""Born to be Blue"", a brassy yet soft-spoken biopic on great jazz trumpeter, Chet Baker. Played by Ethan Hawke in perhaps the strongest lead performance of his career, the semi-fictional film is as smooth as the man dubbed one of the leaders of the ""West Coast cool"" style of jazz.

While personal demons are pretty much a fixture of any movie about great musicians, Born to be Blue does an astounding job depicting Chet's heroin addiction, and how it tugs polar to his addiction to music. The film is about his comeback, sort of, after drug abuse had flatlined his career ad personal life. Chet was a guy who performed with and was admired by the best, including Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie, both of whom are portrayed in the film. In 1966 Chet is starring in a film based on his own life, but before shooting can be completed he's jumped by drug pushers he owes money to. They beat him mercilessly, destroying his teeth and his ability to play the trumpet. His embouchure destroyed, Chet is left a broken man. The only hope he has of recovering is through the strength of his woman, Jane (Carmen Ejogo), who forces him to turn his life around.

Of course it won't be easy, and the film largely focuses on how much of a hook heroin has into Chet's life. Early on he talks glowingly about his ability to do everything better when high, not just musically but in everyday life. But it's also the thing that has cost him the one thing he loves most. Chet's road to recovery is hindered by a dogged probation officer, poor job prospects, and perception within the music industry that he is unreliable. Which he is. When on his game, usually smacked out of his mind, Chet is one of the greats. But it comes with risks that most studios aren't willing to take. The only one who stands by his side throughout is Jane, a fictional character comprised of many women in Chet's life. Fortunately the film doesn't just depict her as a crutch, or turn her into an albatross. Her love for Chet is absolute but she has her own issues to contend with, stemming from being an African-American woman trying to make it as an actress. As a pair of starving artists they rely on one another to get through, an unfortunate rarity in these kinds of films where matters of the heart are sacrificed to the business or personal demons.

While some of the flashbacks smack of standard biopic formula, the film never falls into a predictable pattern. For one thing, Chet's drug addiction is at the center of literally every decision he has to make. At one point he's so down on his luck that he's forced to pump gas, and then take other odd jobs just to keep the probation officer off his back. And yet there are no excuses made for any of it. At one point we visit in on Chet's family and get a sense of his poor upbringing as the son of a disgruntled former musician. But Chet, nor the film, uses this as a reason for his drug use. Instead, Chet simply says it makes him happy when pressed on why he loves it so.

With his chiseled features and wiry frame, Hawke bears a physical resemblance to Chet, but its his quiet disposition and vulnerability that stand out. As Chet, he projects the musician's depression over his many failures, but also the fragile confidence that heroin gives him. It's a totally confident performance from Hawke, reflecting his obvious enthusiasm for the material and respect for Chet Baker's career. ""Born to be Blue"" also shows a certain reverence for the legendary jazz artist, and it pays that respect by treating his story honestly, the high notes and the low.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Be-Blue/dp/B01FIVQGUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Be Blue</a>",1463788800,20,3994,4.759018759018759

7750084,4,B01FIVQGUI,"""Born To Be Blue"" (2015 release; 97 min.) is a movie about jazz legend Chet Baker. As the film opens, we are in ""Lucca, Italy, 1966"" and baker is in prison, only to be bailed out by a Hollywood director. When then go to ""Birdland, New York City, 1954"" when Baker is at the peak of his fame and fortune, only to be exposed to heroin by a femme fatale. As it turns out, we then understand that this entire sequence was reenacted back in ""Los Angeles, 1966"" with Baker, now on the com-back trail, starring in his own movie. Alas, misfortune strikes again, as Baker is viciously assaulted, to such a degree that he cannot play the trumpet anymore. Now he faces even longer odds to come back. At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: the movie does not tell us that this is a ""true story"" or ""inspired by true events"", and for good reason, as this is NOT a bio-pic in any way, shape or form about Chet Baker. Instead, the movie brings a fictionalized composite of certain elements and episodes of Baker's life. Canadian writer-director Robert Budreau makes this into his own cocktail mix, and the end result is quite good, and certainly entertaining. That said, the movie would not have succeeded if it weren't for the outstanding performance by Ethan Hawke as Chet Baker, I mean, Hawke nails it. Kudos also to Carmen Ejogo as Baker's love interest Jane (who is African-American). There are a number of key scenes in the movie. One that stands out for me is when Baker and Jane visit Baker's parents in Oklahoma. At one point, the less than friendly (and outright racist) Baker's dad sneers ""I never dragged the Baker name through the mud"", to which a stunned Baker has no reply, and simply walks away (and leaves for good), wow. If there is one criticism of the movie, I felt that the music was not given a full enough role. There are long stretches in the film where music seems to be an afterthought. Given Baker's fierce love for music, music should never be an afterthought when looking at Baker's life.

""Born To Be Blue"" premiered to great acclaim at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, but despite that only got a very limited theater release in the US (it never made it to my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati). So glad I finally picked this up as a DVD. A comparison between this movie and last year's ""Miles Ahead"" (about jazz legend Miles Davis) is inevitable. I found both movies are quite well done, each in their own way. If you liked ""Miles Ahead"", you are bound to also like ""Born To Be Blue"", and vice versa. Bottom line: ""Born to be Blue"" is worth checking out, be it on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1486598400,,2784,4.478346456692913

Chet was married with three children at the time and lived with his family, he never had a black girlfriend, never filmed a movie in Hollywood about his life, never shared a bill with Miles and Dizzy at Birdland, which had been closed for almost a decade at the time of this ""comeback,"" Dizzy asked Chet to play the Half Note, not Birdland, while in Denver in 1973, Chet recorded ""There's a Small Hotel"" for Richard Bock in 1954, not the late 60s as this film portrays, his father was dead at the time of the comeback depicted, he lost only part of one tooth in the beating, which didn't take place at night outside a bowling alley, but during the day in San Francisco (he was alone at the time), you can play the trumpet with dentures, but not with a temporary bridge as depicted, music was never taped in studios using tape recorders running at 3 3/4 ips as shown, Pacific Jazz studios didn't look anything as depicted, Dizzy never had an ""attitude"" toward Chet as shown here and never told him that he played flat (which Diz himself had a tendency to do) and would never have put him down face-to-face, the dialogue between Chet and Miles Davis is pure fiction, Dizzy is actually shown wearing a beret in 1973, although he stopped wearing berets in the late 40s, the character played by Carmen never existed, the list goes on and on.  This sorry director knows NOTHING about Chet Baker.

Two stars anyway, because it's not a ""bad"" movie per se, but seems to be about a fictional character who happened to by named ""Chet Baker,"" just like the genuine article.  Go see Let's Get Lost, instead and forget this nonsense.",1475452800,2,1644,4.506711409395973

7750120,2,B01FIVQGUI,"I really wanted to love this movie, but a few things got in the way: the script, Ethan's portrayal, and the terrible simulation of trumpet playing. Whoever (if they had anyone) advised him on what fingers to put down to look like a real trumpet player did a terrible job. The portrayals of Miles and Dizzy were terrible. Did anyone do any research on the personality of Dizzy and Miles? Dizzy was gregarious and would have never told Chet that his pitch was flat.

7750122,3,B01FIVQGUI,"Not as good as I thought it would be.  The whole thing was just about him getting beat up and losing his teeth and having to learn how to play trumpet again.  And of course, the drug (heroin) use.  I would have liked to have seen more of the earlier years, and heard more of his music.  The stars are more for Ethan Hawke's acting, as he was excellent in the role.  He WAS Chet Baker!  I read he did his own singing, and Chet had a very distinctive voice, and sound.

7750129,3,B01FIVQGUI,"Ethan Hawke seemed to be really delving into the melancholy spirit of Chet Baker, however he stopped just short.  A semi-convoluted script that seemed to be unsure of which direction it wanted to go limited him a bit.  He could have been even more raw had the direction and script allowed it.  The whole concept of a movie being made within a movie just never panned out or really went anywhere.  Also, too much of a love story in my opinion.  If I wanted to know about Chet's wife I would have rented a movie based on her.  They could have sprinkled that in here and there rather than making it such a focal point.  I would have liked to know more about ACTUAL EXPERIENCES he had  (rather than a handful of them with some filler).  Not sure what was going on with his false teeth the whole time...perhaps to punctuate that he was ashamed ?  In reality there are hundreds of images and live music from young to his later years with him missing teeth as if he didn't care = The opposite of the film! At least explain that for the real fans.  Who were his musical, artistic inspirations, other than Miles Davis etc.  What about Art Pepper ?  Hawke had his posturing down and could have carried some more intense scenes if you let him.  All in all decent but I know that C.Baker had some interesting interactions and moments in his life but this movie had very few.",1471737600,2,1362,4.353174603174603
7750130,1,B01FIVQGUI,"Toughed it out for the first 15 minutes, and abandoned ship shortly thereafter.  Heavy-handed acting, tortuously slow. Gratuitous violence and predictable ""junkie"" moments. The film opens with Hawke soaked with sweat on a prison floor, vomit on his shirt front, hallucinating -- wait, is that a TARANTULA creeping out of the mouth of his trumpet?

I'm well aware heroin was a fixture in Baker's life, and the cause of his ultimate decline and death.  Sadly, most of my jazz heroes followed a similar path. This film does little to change an already cliched view of these artists, and the melodramatic tone certainly doesn't help.",1471737600,5,629,5.028846153846154

7750132,4,B01FIVQGUI,"Earlier in 2016, filmmakers who control these things, decided to release 2 biopics at about the same time.  Both featuring jazz trumpet players who most consider on any list of the greatest.  I watched both within a few days of each other and comparisons are hard to ignore.  Not only were Miles Davis (Miles Ahead) and Chet Baker wildly talented musicians but they were also drug addicts for much of their adult life.  Both principal actors (Don Cheadle in Miles and Ethan Hawke as Chet) were instrumental in getting the films made and both learned how to play trumpet.  While Miles Ahead focuses on a couple mostly fictional segments of the musicians life, Born To Be Blue takes a more extensive look at the ups and downs of Baker.  For purposes of this movie there are more downs.  Unlike the portrayal of Miles Davis whose addictions (alcohol and cocaine) made him reclusive and mean, Baker gets a certain calm from his drugs.

In one scene, after months on methadone tempered withdrawal, Baker tells his record producer, Dick Bock (Callum Rennie, Fifty Shades of Grey) how coke expands how he feels the notes and therefore convey them to the audience.  Finally, someone explains why they go down this path.  The director and writer Robert Budreau doesnt just assume the audience understands this.

Mostly covering a period of the early 1960s, Bakers life is modulated by his love of Jane Azuka (Carmen Ejogo, Selma), an actress he worked with in a movie.  The fictional character is meant to be a composition of some of the women in Bakers life.  The movie has a great look, not only in the urban club settings but in the open expanse of the Oklahoma plains where Baker grew up.  A bonus is some terrific music including some singing of Hawke replicating Bakers soft voice.  Baker found that singing offset some of the discomfort he had playing trumpet with a mouthful of artificial teeth needed after a beat down from his drug supplier.  The studio scene where he sings the classic My Funny Valentine is beautifully constructed and is a turning point in the movie.

Hawke turns in a masterful performance as the troubled musician.  Alas this film isn't available as of this writing, on Blu ray.  Still it looks very good on DVD and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is certainly passable.  Recommended.",1471392000,4,2302,4.750629722921914

8760860,4,B01FIVQGUI,"The wife gives it five stars.  And I think that this would be a really enjoyable movie, and a great intro to the character that is Chet Baker, for those who know absolutely nothing about him.  Now, I am no expert myself about Baker, but even I know enough to know that this movie - for whatever reason(s) - leaves out a heck of a lot of important stuff, including the beginning and ending.

What?  In a movie about Chet Baker it isn't important to show the revolutionary style that made him famous in the first place?  It isn't important to show the rise to fame?  And though the beginning of the film tells us that we are picking up the story during his attempted ""comeback,"" it isn't important as to why he is ""coming back?""  And no portrayal of the final years of touring?  No portrayal, beyond the mere mention, of the circumstances of the death?

For the snippet of the story that this film deals with, it is a really quality and engrossing film.  Having said that, if you think you know the Chet Baker saga from watching this film, you have unfortunately been deprived of some of the most important aspects of that saga.",1528588800,,1126,4.396135265700483
