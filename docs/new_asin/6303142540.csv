7839138,5,6303142540,"Episode 8 in the celebrated documentary on ""The Civil War"" by Ken Burns finds the war finally coming to an end.  Sherman marches to the sea and Richmond finally falls to Grant, setting up Lee's surrender at Appomattox and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  The eloquent narration of David McCullough, the folksy anecdotes of Shelby Foote, and the recognizable voices of some of our most distinguished actors such as Morgan Freeman and Sam Waterson, give the Civil War its voice.  With hundreds of photographs and illustration, a multi-layered soundtrack of effects and music, Burns brings history alive.",990403200,2,607,5.237113402061856
