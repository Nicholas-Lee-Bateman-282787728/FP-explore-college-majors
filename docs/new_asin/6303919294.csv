7856397,1,6303919294,No! In the first minute the angel that came to Mary is a woman! It helps when making a movie of a story from the Bible to actually read the Bible!,1514246400,,146,3.7419354838709675
7856398,1,6303919294,"Don't be fooled by the cover image.  This movie was spliced together in 1984 by a South American film studio that seems to consist of 4 or 5 people,  based on the credits.  The original material seems to be from the early 60's era; acting is poor, film is grainy, and the overdubbed voices are terrible.  End credits reveal it all - end credits are old and not in English, but then after the ""original"" credits the producers added their own credits.  ""Directed by"" is the person who directed the splicing of the original material, not the person who actually directed the film.  Anyway....

This is more like a narrated documentary that attempts to tell a story.",1513987200,,662,4.6068376068376065

7856400,1,6303919294,"This is a low budget movie advertized as<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nativity-The-Life-of-Jesus-Christ-Spanish/dp/B000LC52F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nativity: The Life of Jesus Christ (Spanish)</a>&nbsp;(?) in Spanish, but the only Spanish contents are the titles at the begining and the credits for the music.
Then, all dialogs are in English with no subtitles in any Spanish.
The voices have been doubed in studio by non professional actors and with no care for the acoustics. A character could be distant but will sound up-front, too close to sound convincing and natural.
Some ""poetic licences"" : angel Gabriel is a female character (?)
Does not follow narrations from the gospels. Pitiful movie. A waste of money and time by the producers",1198195200,7,787,6.099099099099099
7856401,5,6303919294,"Jesus Has Risen, a 49-minute dramatization of the last days of Jesus told according to the Gospel of Luke. The four part presentation tells after the betrayal when 'Jesus is brought before the High Priests', 'Trial before Pilate to be Crucified', 'The Lord is Risen' and 'The Lord's Ascension.' For questions that people ask, 'Was Jesus Resurrected from the Tomb on the third day of His Crucifixion?' This is an excellent witnessing tool into the investigation of this divine, miraculous event for those looking for answers.

The proof is written in Luke 24:2-8, they found the empty tomb on that first Easter morning, and the two men in shining garments and said, 'Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen!' Remember what He (Jesus) spoke....""The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.'"" Another excellent source for more study is Lee Strobel's 'The Case of Christ.' It deals with this subject in textual detail of the Resurrection. Strobel, a former atheist and legal editor of the Chicago Tribune interviews historians and philosophers in an investigation whether Jesus of Nazareth was who He claims to be. The facts state that Jesus appeared 'four times' to His followers after the Resurrection. The empty tomb is the ultimate proof of Jesus' claim to being God. and if you what a compelling case by an expert than you need William Lane Craig, the world's foremost. He gave six accounts of solid proof. The Christian and Jewish faith come into agreement with it's existence. Others related books: 'The Blood and the Shroud: New Evidence That the World's Most Sacred Relic is Real' and 'Jesus the Evidence' both by Ian Wilson. On an added note, This would make a fine Easter gift for those who love the mystery and Hope of the Resurrection.",1049068800,,1842,4.7924528301886795
