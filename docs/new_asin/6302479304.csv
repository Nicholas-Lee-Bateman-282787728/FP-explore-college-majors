7828048,5,6302479304,"Thanks to WWE ""Classics On Demand"", I got to relive a classic WCW PPV in SuperBrawl II.  This event was historic in that it was the WCW PPV debut of Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura as a commentator and if you want some foreshadowing in the future of Jim Ross, his broadcast partner at this time, then pay attention to Ventura's interview where he makes comments about how Jim Ross should wear a cowboy hat & the fact that his initials are ""J.R.""  The main event was for the WCW Championship as Sting went after the then-champion in Lex Luger.  The lead heel group in WCW at this time was Paul E. Dangerously's ""Dangerous Alliance"" who were involved in 3 out of the 5 matches on this tape going against the top babyfaces in the company at this time.  Now as usual with WCW PPV's at this time, the VHS tape was edited down to two hours completely erasing matches such as Ron Simmons vs. Cactus Jack, Van Hammer & Z-Man vs. Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash) & Richard Morton, and Marcus Bagwell vs. Terry Taylor eventhough I've read that they still show the pre-match interview with Taylor on the tape.

WCW Light-Heavyweight Champion Jushin Liger vs. Brian Pillman - Probably the most famous match in Pillman's career as this was the top light-heavyweights from Japan & America fighting in a rematch from their non-televised encounter months earlier when Liger won the championship. Pillman did more matwrestling early while Liger used his aerial offense of dropkicks & moonsaults off the top rope both in & out of the ring. When Brian started to pull of his ""Air Pillman"" offense with his flying clothesline & cross bodyblock, Liger tried to ground Pillman by working over his legs with moves like the figure four. This was without a doubt one of the greatest matches in WCW's history when it came to crusierweight/light-heavyweight action. Look out for such moments like Liger executing his ""Liger Bomb"", Pillman executing an impactful DDT, and one hell of a suplex by Liger.

Barry Windham & Dustin Rhodes vs. Steve Austin & Larry Zbyszko - Windham & Rhodes were looking for revenge against Zbyszko for breaking Windham's hand in a car door months earlier at Halloween Havoc and they definately showcased that point right from the start by brawling in the ring & onto the rampway right from the start.  Larry was reluctant to get in the ring at first since Windham made it clear that he was the one he wanted & also had his fist heavily taped due to the injury.  Both Dustin & Barry heavily worked over Larry's arm before Austin was able to get involved to give the advantage back to the Alliance and at one point gave Dustin such an impactful clothesline that it turned him inside out.  The match went back & forth between both teans here & got real competitve as times went on with not only Windham & Rhodes gaining a bit of revenge but also planted the seed for the beginning of one member of the Dangerous Alliance becoming the ""weak link"" of the group.

WCW Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Bobby Eaton vs. Steiner Brothers - This is a tag team wrestling fans dream match on paper with former members of some of the greatest tag teams in Eaton (Midnight Express) & Anderson (Ole Anderson & Tully Blanchard) against one of the greatest tag teams in recent years in the Steiner Brothers (held 3 different tag team titles at one time).  It was stated that Paul E. Dangerously was already banned from ringside during the upcoming U.S. Title match but the call was also made here to have him banned from ringside during this match as well causing Madusa to manage the Alliance team.  Steiners got the early advantage with Rick overpowering Arn while Scott grounded Bobby Eaton & pulling off moves such as a tilt-a-wirl slam on the ramp to Bobby Eaton before executing the Doomsday Device with Rick.  Anderson & Eaton had to resort to dirty tactics like a low blow & Arn even sacrificing Bobby just to get the advantage in their favor & executing such moves as Eaton landing a rocket launcher onto Scott on the ramp.  The Steiners were able to get the advantage back after he was on Anderson's shoulders & countered Eaton's crossbody into a slam before Anderson resorted to blinding Rick who accidently suplexed a referee to get the disqualification victory after everyone thought the Steiners won the tag team titles.  This was a classic tag team wrestling match from start to finish.

WCW United States Champion Rick Rude vs. Ricky Steamboat - Before I get started, just pay attention to Rick Rude's entrance as he had so much heat on him that he couldn't hear himself on the microphone after trying numerous times.  Dangerously was banned from ringside for this match as well while Ricky Steamboat came to the ring with a ninja to insure no interfearence from the Dangerous Alliance.  Steamboat heavily focused on Rude's arm with armdrags & armbars early on to the point where Rude couldn't put his hands on his head to do his hip taunt.  Rude countered by working on Steamboat's neck with various spinning neckbreakers, headlocks & chinlocks, a piledriver, and even dropping Steamboat on the outside rail.  This had a great series of moves & counters like Rude's sleeper being reversed by Steamboat before Rude countered that.  The deciding factor in the end happened when the ninja got involved & used a cell phone to help Rude win the match but despite the ending, this was definately a high quality match that opened the door for this feud to continue...which nobody objected to.

WCW Champion Lex Luger vs. Sting - This was Luger's first in-ring appearence in many weeks & heavily bulked up since the last time he was seen on TV.  Both men trash talked each other early & started off very aggressive with Sting hitting a Stinger Splash early on Luger only for him to come out of the corner with a powerful clothesline & powerslam.  Sting was able to recover & even apply the Torture Rack onto Luger at one point before Lex regained control & slowed the pace down before his ego worked against him with his arrogant covers.  Sting got more aggressive & even did things unnatural of him like raking Luger's back before Harley Race tried to get involved to no avail as Sting went on with a big splash to win his second World Championship.  The match was real good but it was a stepdown from the previous matches throughout the night as Luger as very ""on & off"" to the point where he completely no-sold the splash at the end as he got up right away after the 3 count almost making it look like a fluke as this was Luger's last WCW appearence until the first episode of ""WCW Monday Nitro"" over 3 years later.

In the end, this tape was one of WCW's highest quality cards in it's history that I would definately want to get my hands on if I was a WCW fan.",1285372800,,6775,4.596185737976783
7828049,5,6302479304,"An old tape that I found in my collection as this was the first Superbrawl event that I was able to see (I would see the first one a couple of years later). Eric Bischoff & Tony Shavione along with Missy Hyatt host the show while Jim Ross did the commentary with his new color commentator in the WCW debut of Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura who arrived on his Harley Davidson. Also it should be noted that I have the actual event when it aired live whereas during this time, WCW released their events edited down to 2 hours but honestly, that is a better investment since this event has some fillers that take you away from the great action like Terry Taylor vs Marcus Bagwell, Ron Simmons vs Cactus Jack & Z-Man & Van Hammer vs Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash) & Richard Morton.

WCW Light Heavyweight Champion Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger vs ""Flying"" Brian Pillman. Honestly, this was the match that stole the show & one of the best light heavyweight/cruiserweight matches of all time as these two put on an awesome performance. These two worked very well together as they just knew how to mix the high-flying aerial offense with great wrestling non-stop in a match that I consider a lost classic encounter & again my favorite match of the night.

Barry Windham & Dustin Rhodes vs Steve Austin & Larry Zbyszko. This was billed as a grudge match due to what happened at Halloween Havoc & is when the event begins to pick up as this was the best match that the crowd had seen since the opener. Great tag team match as all four men worked well together as you get to see a different performance that you are used to from Steve Austin while Windham & Rhodes showed their underrated ability for it's time along with Zbyszko holding his own as well.

WCW Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Bobby Eaton vs The Steiner Brothers. Another great tag team match with Anderson & Eaton using that they were an underrated team by using all of the classic heel tag team moves like double-teaming behind the referee's back & taking advantage of the ref's count while we know what to expect from the Steiners during this point in their careers. However, the real highlight was how the ending was set up that lead to a shocking ending that most fans didn't expect at the time.

WCW United States Champion Rick Rude vs Ricky Steamboat. This match gets overshadowed by their future Iron Man match at Beach Blast '92 as these two put on a great performance with the story being that Rude was targeting Steamboat's back to the point where Steamboat did a suplex off the top turnbuckle & it took him a while to execute the move perfectly. However, the highlight here was when the ""Ninja"" ""turned"" on Steamboat to allow Rude to retain the title. After the match, The Ninja was revealed to be Paul E. Dangerously.

WCW Champion Lex Luger vs Sting. After months of build-up, these two battle for the first time since Starrcade '89. This was during Luger's best run as champion as he was able to put on a good performance here as his power offense meshed well with Sting's style in what was a good back & forth encounter between these two. The ending gave the fans what they wanted to see & that was Sting regain the WCW title with Luger leaving WCW for the WWF at this point as well.

Overall, this was a great show with the highlights being the tag team matches featuring the Dangerous Alliance members, Rude/Steamboat, Sting/Luger & the lost classic Pillman/Liger match that you can find on Pillman's DVD. The edited event alone is 5 star show while the whole show in its entirety is a 4 star event.",1260748800,,3555,4.495356037151703
