8368489,4,B0000714DZ,"This Hong Kong movie is a cop drama with elements of violence and sexual innuendo. Dee is a triad gangmember (he really is an undercover policeman and nobody else knows this) and White Board is his 21 year old protg. Melody is a newspaper reporter looking for a big scoop on the triads and she convinced White Board to help her by being his girlfriend. BB is a Red Light District masseuse, Dee's girlfriend and White Board's sister.

A traumatic incident in Dee's past is brought to the surface by the flashing lights of an ambulance vehicle, and that's creates a split personality. The ""Killer in Mask"" is a samurai-sword wielding vigilante that butchers the triad gangs, but Dee has no idea that he's the person responsible. The conclusion is sad but not that convincing, where they all discover the awful truth about the so-called two men in one person. There are a lot of deaths, and three of the main characters will die.

One scene that I thought was weak: Melody gives White Board a long kiss before he goes on a dangerous mission. It's obvious to me the scene was staged by all the people who are apparently just there to gawk at them smooching. Just have them walk around or pretend to be eating on the boardwalk, it's not an exhibition!",1262995200,,1246,4.558035714285714
