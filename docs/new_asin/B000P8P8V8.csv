8189913,5,B000P8P8V8,"My mom was a big Gilad fan so I grew up exercising with his show and videos. This tape is a compilation of his early work in the mid-80's. I thought the exercises would be too easy since none include weights but I was wrong! These are different moves than what he did in the 90's. It reminds me of Pilates and I was definitely sore the next day. Even if you are not a fan of exercise videos, this is worth it just for the retro 80's hair and workout clothing. Good stuff!",1355184000,2,471,4.0212765957446805
