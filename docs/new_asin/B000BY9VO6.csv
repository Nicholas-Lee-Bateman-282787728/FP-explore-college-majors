2445429,4,B000BY9VO6,"For fans of Japanese cars & drift racing this is a must.

It deserves 4 stars for the driving action scenes alone, made well before the recent Tokyo Drift movie & probably more true to life.

The story line is nothing special, but this is a cult comic book in Japan & fitting everything into a movie can sometimes be difficult.

Watch the chinese version with subtitles, the dubbing is OK but the voices always seem weird !!",1155859200,4,424,4.410256410256411
2445430,5,B000BY9VO6,Guys look I know that by the reviews that the movie is not like the manga anime series but for what it is the movie is a fun action comedy that you can enjoy. Aleast you don't have to dramatize it into a life or death situaition like the Fast and Furious series has beeen doing. This has cool racing scenes and sweet cars doing the best drifting i've ever seen. And not to mention the comidic side of this story works and Anthony Wong is the man. If you hate this movie just because it did not stay true to the anime then you are being unfair to this movie. This is a fun film to watch and you will find it refreshing to see as Initial D will take you to the wildest drift of your life.,1153785600,10,686,3.9424460431654675
2445431,5,B000BY9VO6,"When I fristly saw this movie last June in China, I felt my heart beating much more quick. Drift is not only the technicis, but also an attitude - to your life. Do whatever you really want in your life, even a lot of bitter and trouble. Maybe that's the way I am. Nobody can change it.",1142812800,,285,4.017543859649122
2445432,4,B000BY9VO6,"It's hard to give a review of this, because it could go either way.  Some people like it and some people don't, but I don't think you'd be able to tell until you've watched it.  Personally, I liked the live action movie--I liked the anime better, but the live action was still pretty cool.  There are obviously changes that the directors made that many people won't like, but...  Overall, I liked it, and if you haven't seen it, check it out and see for yourself.",1141948800,9,463,4.411764705882353
2445433,3,B000BY9VO6,"While the anime stayed fairly close to the manga, this live action movie makes substantial character and plot changes.  For instance, Bunta is now perceived more as a drunken womanizer more than the retired legendary (yet still smug and egotistical) racer from Akina.  Ryousuke and Keisuke Takahashi are essentially one character.  Several other characters don't even appear in the movie.

The plot was also condensed considerably.  Instead of being a movie covering a few races from the anime's first season, it compresses everything from the first three stages (which took the anime 39 thirty-minute episodes and its own two-hour movie).  Obviously with about two hours of time, this movie had to drop several races and increase the pace of character and car driving technique development.

However, the movie does get some things right.  Character development is focused on Takumi and his indecisiveness of what he wants to be in life.  The actual car racing uses the real cars that the characters drive in the series, and most of the driving is more realistic than completely special effects.  The mood of the movie fits, and it follows the general ""teenager who has special skills but doesn't know it"" plot of the series.  Itsuki is still the overzealous racer wanna-be, even if his character's background was totally changed.

One thing to note is that there is absolutely no EuroBeat music in this version, which can be a good or bad thing depending if you're a fan.  Most of the Chinese pop music is from Jay Chou, who plays Takumi.

In the end, if you're a previous fan of the series, don't go in expecting to see a live-action version of the anime or manga.  You'll just end up disappointed that the movie tries to cover so much ground in such a short amount of time.  This movie is like the later Harry Potter movies in that it is an okay adaption of a much better and more detailed story.",1137715200,23,1900,4.764525993883792
2445434,5,B000BY9VO6,I got the chinese version of this movie. If you like the manga and anime you going to like the movie. It has the best of both worlds. Nice racing without NOS becuase if you can't get the power with engine and skill don't get on the road.,1134000000,5,237,3.9583333333333335
2445435,5,B000BY9VO6,"Awesome movie. I am so surprised it never got an American remake. Hey, they remade Vanishing Point so... evil does exist.",1408406400,,121,4.809523809523809
2445436,5,B000BY9VO6,"I enjoyed Initial D - Stage 3 the Movie. This is the movie that bridges the gap between season 2 and 3 of Initial D so I recommend watching it before you watch the 3rd season (fourth stage).

In this story, Takumi gets invited by Ryosuke Takahashi  to joint a racing group he is putting together. But before Takumi will agree to join, he has to settle some unfinished business from season 2 (Second Stage), one of which is a rematch with Emperors leader, Kyoichi. Another matter that Takumi must come to terms with is his relationship with Natsuki. Takumi has to decided whether or not he will forgive her or not.

Overall I thought the story was pretty satisfying. I thought most of the lose ends from the second season were tied off nicely and enjoyed the character interaction. The race scenes were also pretty cool, as well. One of my favorites was a race between Takumi and the son of someone Bunta had raced against in his old racing days. I thought the animation was pretty good, as well. I was happy to see that the animators fixed Takumi's eye color from the second season to brown as I found the blue kind of weird for a character who's supposed to be Japanese. I also think the English dub voices are pretty good. I feel voices match the characters well and are not annoying as some English voice dubs can be.

Again, overall I really enjoyed Initial D - Stage 3 the Movie and would recommend it anyone who is a fan of the Initial D anime and of racing shows in general.",1392163200,,1481,4.374545454545455
2445437,3,B000BY9VO6,"If you really like initial d the anime series I would say this is the equivalent of growing up watching the dragon ball anime and then watching dragonball revolution, honestly not the best portrayal of the series and the English dub isn't that great but its worth a watch.",1391299200,,272,4.571428571428571

2445443,4,B000BY9VO6,"As just about every review says the same thing for this movie, the anime was better.  And that is true, the anime is better, but the anime runs about 15 hours longer than this movie if you watch the entire series.  Im not really a fan of how condensed the movie was.  It is full of very good racing scenes, even if the movie does not go into as much detail as the anime did.  It's still pretty cool to see the racing in live action.  I did not enjoy the change of so much of the plot.  Itsuki was alot more of a likeable character as the stupid but good hearted best friend from the anime than he is as the spoiled punk in this movie.  And Buntha was also alot more likeable as a quite humble retired street racer rather than a womanizing drunk.  My advice would be to those who have watched the anime, this is still a good buy if you are a fan of the series.  It is interesting to see the whole story in the eyes of a different producer/director.  Enjoy.  If you haven't seen the series and you plan to watch this first, please do not judge the anime based on this movie, although the storylines are similar the anime series goes into alot more detail and is almost educational in the art of drift.  I suggest watching the entire series, all four stages, before watching the movie.  One last note is that in this edition, the english dubbing is very B-movie-esque.  Just as I would suggest with the anime, I would suggest watching at least once with the original japanese soundtrack with subtitles.  There is definitely a better sense of mood with the original language.  Just remember to try and see this movie as a stand alone package, despite the fact it is based on the anime series, its like hamburger and filet mignon.  Its not that hamburger is bad, I love a good hamburger, its just filet mignon is alot tastier.",1326412800,2,1821,4.3088235294117645
2445444,5,B000BY9VO6,"i have this movie on dvd,but i got the bluray version because i finally have a 1080p tv. it looks great on bluray. im a fan of the series. so get the movie and enjoy.",1304467200,,166,3.7714285714285714
2445445,5,B000BY9VO6,"As a youth drama, it works. As an action flick, it works. As a racing movie, it had me holding my breath. I grew up with films like BULLITT and LE MANS, where the directors had to get you IN the cars with the drivers to ratchet up the suspense. Lau does that here.

The sly humor with Wong and Chou's interactions, and the boasting kid whose dad owns a gas station, always leave me laughing, even after my fourth viewing.

But what really grabs me in this film is the phenomenal 5/6 track soundtrack. During a few scenes, with your home theater fully ramped up, you can hear cars growling around the snakelike mountain roads, weaving in and out of view, the headlights playing peek-a-boo through the trees, and the sound peeping in and out of all the channels in your speaker setup. It can be an eerie, moving experience, and for my money better illustrates the thrill of driving the sports cars down this mountain in the story than any CGI does. It's that good.

The film is polished to a high shine. It got me interested in Lau's other films, just as stylish and memorable. Definitely getting the Blu-Ray of this.",1299628800,,1115,4.455882352941177
2445446,3,B000BY9VO6,"I was hoping to be able to watch the original Japanese vocals with subtitles.  Unfortunately, I don't believe this is an option unless I missed something to enable it.  So, you get English dub only.  Just thought some people might want to know this before purchasing.

Also, the animation style is a little closer to the first stage as far as the character drawings which I thought was better.  I didn't like the feel as much with the second stage characters.

As far as the video itself, you can probably look up the content review for this in the DVD section.  For me it seemed like a bunch of episodes strung together rather than a well put together movie.  It's still worth watching if you're a fan.",1297641600,4,703,4.480314960629921
2445447,5,B000BY9VO6,"I never watched the animated series. I saw this movie a few years ago, my cousin had it and i loved the movie. One day I randomly decided to have a copy of my own and at $5 it was well worth it. If you like movies about racing, more specifically about drifting, im sure you will enjoy this movie.

*originally in japanese but dubbed in english and also includes the option for subtitles",1295913600,,386,4.216216216216216
2445448,2,B000BY9VO6,"I love racing films. I've watched this HK adaptation of Initial D twice, first time without any knowledge of the original manga and anime, and second time recently after I'd watched all the free episodes of the anime series on Hulu. The first time I watched this movie I thought the car stunts were great -- I had been a fan of the Ridge Racer games so I was familiar with drifting -- but hated the cast. Understandably so, I liked the film even less the 2nd time around. The natural coolness of Takumi is just not there, and Anthony Wang's rendition of Bunta is completely trash (even though the Euroasian Wang is an otherwise excellent actor). The Japanese supporting cast is amateurish, including Anne Suzuki as Mogi. (The only bearable guy is the Kyouichi character.) There is no chemistry between any of the characters, and the changes in plot were frustrating to watch after I'd seen the anime. Still, I decided to give this 2 stars because the car stunts, performed mostly by the Takahashi Racing Team (owned by a guy surnamed Takahashi, like Ryosuke and Keisuke!), are just incredible. I especially love the three-car race at the end and wonder how they coordinated the sequence... For the drifting stunts alone and only for the drifting stunts alone, this is a worthy movie for racing fans to watch and own.",1287014400,,1316,4.701298701298701
2445449,4,B000BY9VO6,"Great movie if you are a fan of tuning and sports compact racing. I'll recommend to anybody that liked the fast and furios movies like myself (not the second one that much at all though)
I hope the sequel of this movie is released soon and the fd3s makes an appearance.",1281312000,,269,4.294117647058823
2445450,5,B000BY9VO6,"This is a good example of a anime series turned live action movie is done right. It is amazing how Tai Seng Entertainment were able to stay true to the manga and anime series. It truly the movie that shows the world the new racing phenomenon known as Drifting. The only other movie I think of that comes close to this is The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift. If you want an anime series turned live action movie done right, look no further than to Initial D to see.",1275696000,,464,4.166666666666667
2445451,1,B000BY9VO6,"This movie is just aweful....
It's like they took a bunch of distorted clips of the original story and pasted them together.
It barely creates a story line and doesn't have near enough filler to explain whats really going on.
Watch the anime. It's much better.",1258156800,,260,4.673913043478261
2445452,5,B000BY9VO6,"what else is there to say. I'm a huge fan of the InitialD series, and loved the movie. this is the second movie I have thought was worth paying the extra money to have it in blue-Ray. If you like InitialD, I would recommend buying this movie.",1252713600,,242,4.170212765957447
2445453,2,B000BY9VO6,"I'm not a car fan, nor a racing fan, but when I stumbled upon the anime, I loved it. So, even though I knew the live action film wouldn't be the same, I still looked forward to seeing it.  As I have never read the manga, any comparisons I make are between the anime and the live action versions.

Like any movie that is adapted from another souce, they made changes, some significant - Bunta, Takumi's father is a womanizing alcoholic who abuses his son, and Itsuki is a braggard,, rather than the nerdy side kick - both revisions did not appeal to me. On the other hand, Jay Chou, who plays Takumi, did an excellent job of projecting the personality of the character in the anime, and which is part of the appeal for the story - a kid who doesn't know or like cars is a better racer than those obsessed by cars - and then finds focus in his life by racing.

I think the problem with this film is that it tries to do too much.  This is worse for viewers familiar with the anime or manga because character and racing development takes place in leaps, rather than steps.  Even for viewers who come in with no knowledge of the characters, sometimes you wonder where they are coming from - and basically, I think it comes from trying to imitate the major points from the original story without spending the time to develop it.  On the other hand, the movie does revise characters' personalities and histories, so it is also trying to add some original touches. In the end, the movie is neither original, nor a faithful adaptation for the hard-core anime fans.

For me, the movie itself is a two star rating, but might be a 2 1/2 for those who give higher priority to visual racing scenes, or three for those not familiar with the anime - but as far as the Amazon rating stars, it still gets two because, as other reviews have stated, those trailers in the beginning are really annoying.  Not only did I spend some extra time trying to skip past the trailers, but when the movie finally started, I realized that I forgot to set the sub-titles and had to sit through the trailers again. If you are going to watch this movie, make sure to see it in one sitting - it's just not worth having to sit through the trailers just to get to the movie and then getting to the point you left off at.",1242432000,2,2282,4.303030303030303
2445454,4,B000BY9VO6,"Since this is in blu-ray, it's quality is awesome. I saw this movie before and not in blu-ray quality. 1080p does make a huge difference.

As storyline goes, it's kind of close to the anime. It just felt like it crammed a whole lot of episodes in 2 hours worth of a movie. Too much was going on. And at the end, you are left hanging.

2445457,4,B000BY9VO6,"When word came out that INITIAL D was being made into the live movie, I was very anxious.

  Knowing that directors Andrew Lau Wai-Keung and Alan Mak Siu-Fai would be directing this film (especially since their collaboration has led to the critically acclaimed film INFERNAL AFFAIRS),  this film had a great chance to be adapted correctly from its anime and manga bretheren.

  The main hype of this film was because of the main star, popular singer Jay Chou who would be playing the main character of Takumi.

  The reviews of the film from reviewers throughout Asia was 50/50.  Many who had no knowledge of the anime or film and simply hated the fact that Jay Chou's character was the way it was and many felt his acting was just wooden.

  Many felt that the film featured too much on car racing and thus, those who got it and knew what INITIAL D and also have watched many Hong Kong films respected the film for what its worth.

  I enjoyed the film.  I was excited when I watched it and when it ended, I wanted more.

  Was it faithful to the anime or manga?  I think the directors did very well with the film, capturing the geekiness of Takumi's friends and the racing was just fun to watch.

  I enjoyed the fact that there were a lot of HK stars who participated in this film and with the DTS soundtrack, enjoyed the sound of the engine roaring all over my speakers.

  But I'm an INITIAL D fan, I'm also a Jay Chou music fan and I like watching cars race and drift.

  But since Initial D focuses a lot on the racing, this is going to turn many viewers off who are not into it.

  Oh well.  I enjoyed it.

  The DVD features a making of featurette, deleted scenes, outttakes, photo gallery, TV spots and trailers and promotionals done in Shanghai and Japan.  As well as several Easter eggs.

  Video is anamorphic Widescreen 2:35:1 and for audio a DTS-ES and Dolby Digital EX Surround tracks are available.

  All in all, if you are open to something new and have an interest in import racing, I say give INITIAL D a chance.  For a racing film, it's not as engaging as Full Throttle or Legend of Speed but I found it very entertaining.",1220400000,,2144,4.368286445012788

2445462,5,B000BY9VO6,"Since nobody has reviewed the Blu-ray transfer, I might as well.  I will start off by saying that I have this on DVD as well and this review will be based in comparison to it in terms of video/audio quality.

At first I was a bit skeptical about this one, I am not too familiar with studios doing transfers from over seas.  But just wow, this video transfer is definitely a step up from the DVD!  The clarity and color is just superb and it was definitely a joy to watch again.  You can actually see the detail in skin tones (like most great transfers) and during the races  it pretty crystal clear to keep up with the action.  My only gripe about the transfer is that some scenes are a hit and miss.  Like you can catch some noise in some scenes (most notably in the Gas Station scenes) and BLACKS are sometimes crushing (most notably during in-car scenes at night).

Sorry but I am still running a standard 5.1 DD and in terms of the audio quality its nearly identical to the DVD's 5.1 DD.  If anyone gets to test the Cantonese LPCM let me know how it turns out!  I actually watched this movie in English DD and the dubbing is so-so as expected but fitting.

All in all if you are a fellow Blu-ray enthusiast, I actually would recommend this one and being at 19.00 smacks, its actually worth more than that sitting nicely in your collection.

I was intrigued as to how they would be able to film and tell this story, mostly because it has a massive original story, to encompass that into 2 hours is most difficult. I believe the way it turned is excellent considering they had to change the storyline slightly from the original to have appeal as a standalone film. From beginning to end, this HK car flick is full of beauty, class, and professionalism, something not seen a whole lot in HK car flicks. Everything has a sense of artistic view, be it from mountain and Lake Akina shots, to the intense downhill battles, to the character dialogue.

2445470,1,B000BY9VO6,"This is a DVD that has to be started 10 minutes before you're actually ready to sit down and watch the movie because THERE ARE 10 MINUTES OF PREVIEWS WHICH YOU CANNOT SKIP OR FAST FORWARD.  I was so pissed off by that, that by the time it let me start the movie, I just could NOT find a way to enjoy it.

An hour into the movie, I stopped it and found something else to do.  I didn't try to finish watching it until at least a week later (after, of course, doing something else while the 10 minutes of unskippable previews played out).  But I was still so burned about that abrasive form of advertising that I still couldn't get into it.

To this day, every time I hear ""Initial D"" the first thing that springs into my mind is how pissed off that DVD makes me.  I like to watch movie trailers, but only AFTER I've watched the feature presentation, NOT EVERY BLOODY TIME I SIMIPLY LOAD THE DVD!

Oh, and as for the movie itself, another thing that annoyed me was the language select.  When watching foreign films, I prefer listening to the original language.  Being a 2005 Hong Kong film, you'd think it were Cantonese, but I couldn't figure out whether it was supposed to be Cantonese or Mandarin.  I later found out this is one of those films where the actors all speak their mother tongues, then the final production is dubbed at whichever scenes don't match the target language.  Silly me, I tried cycling through the language channels when *Japanese* actors were talking (there is no Japanese Audio on the U.S. DVD), so of course I never found the channel that sync'd right.  (I did later find out that Cantonese is the ""main"" language.)

I'm not sure if I'll ever bother trying to watch this again.  Aside from the annoyance of having to wait through 10 minutes of previews every time I want to watch the movie, I didn't find the story very interesting.  I'm not a car-guy, so I'm not easily captivated by watching people compete to see who can be the fastest jerk on the road without breaking the tofu.  (I'd rather just play Carmageddon.)",1183593600,3,2045,4.427807486631016
2445471,1,B000BY9VO6,"What a sad attempt at bringing an amazing anime to movie. It is entertaining but if you expect it to be anything like the anime, you will be sorely dissapointed. They have changed the characters around, (Personalities) taken some characters out and changed plot lines. If you have never seen the anime perhaps you will enjoy it. Else wise, blah!",1176249600,,345,4.766666666666667
2445472,3,B000BY9VO6,"""Initial D"" is a fairly good film.  With about 5 separate car races and numerous flashbacks where the same footage is repeated in montages, the film does tend to drag a bit.

Jay Chou plays the teenage Takumi whose stoic facial expressions as a tofu delivery boy get punctured by love.  Chou did much of the music in the film; and we see fancy footwork on the car pedals as he jams into gear around the curves.  He gets some nice reaction shots after his romantic breakup.  Chou followed this, his first film, with ""Curse of the Yellow Flower.""

Anthony Wong who was recently in ""The Painted Veil"" plays his alcoholic father who is an ex-racer but who has spiraled downhill since the loss of his wife.  He keeps passing out, but he knows how to outfit a tofu delivery car.  After repeated threats to knock his son around, it was a wink that let his son know how much his dad loves him.  With a cigarette dangling, Wong plays the perfect vagabond.

Anne Suzuki who was in ""Moon Child"" & ""Snow Falling Cedars"" plays Natsuki.  She seems to be a normal high school girl who develops a crush on Takumi.  However, we soon find that the uncle who takes care of her is an older guy who uses her for physical pleasure at the ""Love Hotel.""  Obviously, this causes some problems in her relationship with Takumi who is her true love.  Suzuki seemed far too nice and innocent to believably play a lady of the evening (or in her case afternoon), but she does a good job with the innocent love in the film.

Chapman To who was so good in ""Six Strong Characters"" plays the heavy-set Itsuki, best friend of Takumi.  His father owns the service station at which Takumi works.  To is the comic relief of the picture, mugging, full of bravado one moment and vomiting by the curb from carsickness the next.  Kenny Bee does a nice job as Itsuki's father, owner of the service station.

Edison Chen who was in ""Gen Y-Cops"" does a good job as being the other independent racer who tries to take out the professional in the climactic final race.  The race sequences, mostly at night, are well filmed and keep you glued to the screen.  While there may be a few too many of them, overall this is a good movie that grabs your attention and makes you care about its characters.  Enjoy!",1176163200,4,2256,4.411622276029056
2445473,4,B000BY9VO6,"I wasn't sure what to expect...didn't know if this would hold true to the anime series of the same name. But, I was pleasantly surprised! Unlike Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift, it didn't go down that same road and stayed true to the spirit of the series. My only quibble is that they tried to cram everything into a near-2 hour movie, but despite that, it's a must see.",1168300800,5,370,4.3
2445474,5,B000BY9VO6,"If you were thinking of buying Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, don't. This movie is far better as far as realism goes, the behind the scenes extras are really cool too. Great REAL drifting footage. Sorry, there's no romance while ""drifting"" on a mountain road like that other movie. Loved this film.",1164672000,3,302,4.716981132075472
2445475,5,B000BY9VO6,"I have read many of the reviews, and I realize that this movie is a condensed form of the anime series, however, I have to admit that this movie was excellent.  Try comparing this movie to the first two incarnations of Fast and Furious (especially #2), I would have to say that Initial D is by far the superior.

The storyline is basic but enjoyable, with the main characters getting a decent amount of screen time.  However, what sets the movie apart is the cars!  I am a car nut, and I love the way the cars, ranging from the RX-7 to the Trueno, were cleanly built and well crafted to fit the mold from the anime.  The drifting sequences were breath-taking, including the final racing sequence (I'll let you watch that).

Please remember that this is geared mainly for those that enjoy cars and drifting, then I highly recommend this.",1164153600,3,836,4.503311258278146
2445476,4,B000BY9VO6,I was a little skeptical about the Initial D movie just because it was with real people.  And not just animated people.  But the movie turned out to be actually pretty good.,1162684800,,173,4.375
2445477,2,B000BY9VO6,"Popped the DVD into my Denon DVD player and it started playing VERY long opening trailers...which you could NOT skip.  Only buttons on the remote that worked were eject, stop, and power off.

Tai Seng - the big US studios know not to do this in North America, maybe you need to learn a lesson.

This was not a free DVD, it was purchased for me to watch, let me skip the trailers.

Movie was pretty good, but I would have doubts about buying this DVD and supporting this sort of forced advertising on a DVD you bought with your hard-earned money.",1159228800,2,545,4.313725490196078
