8185689,5,B000OMM9Y4,"A well done and short documentary on freight railroads in the US. Slightly dated as the term PTC (Positive Train Control) is not used and an older term is used but otherwise excellent.

If you are interested in learning about freight railroads and their importance to the US economy this is a great place to start.",1354579200,,314,4.607142857142857
8185690,5,B000OMM9Y4,"Provides informative and interesting information on America's freight trains. Begins with the daily work at U.P.'s maintenance facility in North Platte, NE, then on to the origins of railroads (animals pulling coal and ore out of mines - soon replaced by steam engines), and the evolution of engines (animal, steam, diesel).

First ""replicated"" train engine was the 1831 ""John Bull"" - soon new models were continually coming out.  Diesels are much easier to maintain, and multiple units can be controlled by a single individual.  Diesels were introduced in the 1930s or so, but limited to minor switch-engine or light passenger work.  Did not begin a major role until the 1940s when a 1,350 h.p. model came out.  Today's diesels (4,400 h.p. are assembled in 26 days at a G.E. facility; design replaces 16 cylinders with 12, with a slight fuel improvement).

Brakemen formerly were deployed every 5-6 cars, performing very dangerous work that required walking over the tops of the cars while in motion.  Hundreds of thousands killed each year.  George Westinghouse's air-brake invention was a major improvement.  Today's diesel-electrics also have dynamic braking from running the electric motors in reverse (aka auto hybrids).

Container freight is the #1 revenue producer for trains; #2 is coal.  Former railroads were organized to compete against each other - this changed in the 1950s with sizable volume losses to trucks.  Trains responded by merging to eliminate delays associated with moving from one system to another.",1218153600,4,1525,5.256198347107438
