3481488,5,B001B3LIQK,very good movie a great tv show watched it for years but missed so bought the series....,1259712000,,88,4.235294117647059
3481489,5,B001B3LIQK,"There are few consistently truly funny TV series, despite repetitive punch lines, that brings the kind of humor that can literally have one fall off the couch as this series. Brilliantly conceived, especially the Englishman who THINKS he can speak French, but using English words (or misspellings and pronunciations) this hilarious and heartwarming scenario in alleged WWII German occupied France is perpetually hilarious. The portrayal of German officers, even the Gestapo, as well as the female controlled underground, hit a tone of commonality that even our visiting German relatives cannot get enough of. Series 1-6 was a thoughtful then 70th birthday present, but we just had to order more recently released 7-9 to its completion. How this was missed in its heyday is beyond me, but is once again an excellent benefit of DVD possibilities. No one should miss out on this fabulous fun filled series, but they must be prepared to spend hours upon hours improving their health by laughing over and over. Considering that the entire cast is practically all British it is amazing how they have captured our perception the French character and accent. A very worth while investment, indeed, and one to be shared with others. There are unexpected surprises throughout, and even the replacement of characters due to untimely deaths does little to take away of the ongoing pattern. Do yourself a great favor--invest in this series. You will not regret it.",1258502400,4,1451,5.1265822784810124
3481490,5,B001B3LIQK,"Allo Allo is one of the best British Comedies.  This series takes place in Nazi-Occupied France during WWII and is based around the French Resistance around the town of Nuvian (sp?).

Series 9 is the final season of the show and has a great conclusion.  The ending wraps up the characters lives in a hilarious end.

I have been a fan of this show for 15 years and have really enjoyed the DVD sets.  Great show.  Unlike most British Comedies, the humor is more obvious and outrageous.",1229731200,,483,4.494252873563219
3481491,5,B001B3LIQK,"'Allo 'Allo has been one of my all-time favourite comedy series. Series Nine is the final chapter in a wonderfully written tale. I loved the ending! I especially admired the strength of Rene who in real life got into a terrible vehicular accident, ended up in a coma and thankfully recovered. He insisted that he finish the show and saw it through to the very end. I am happy to say that I purchased all nine series from Amazon and this collection is one of my most prized possessions. Truly a fantastic ending to a fantastic show! Two thumbs up! - Seema (T&T)",1229299200,5,560,4.446601941747573

3481493,5,B001B3LIQK,"Although I wasn't sure of this one in the beginning, now that I've seen all 9 series I have to admit it's one of the funniest Britcoms I've seen.  Delightful.",1226880000,,158,4.266666666666667
3481494,5,B001B3LIQK,"These seem to be the final episodes of a very funny Brit comedy.

The disks include a retrospective of previous episodes that are quite nostalgic.",1225584000,,146,4.84
3481495,5,B001B3LIQK,'Allo 'Allo is one of the funniest shows ever made anywhere. But as all things must it ends. The last half of the very last episode is a brilliant epilogue to the war. The special feature where Rene' and Edith remember stories is disappointing at best. There were much funnier moments that could and should have been shown instead of what was picked. But if you have a passion for Brit humor then this is the show for you.,1224201600,,422,4.3544303797468356
3481496,5,B001B3LIQK,"Here it is... the final series of one of my favorite imports and a surprisingly funny sitcom about the German occupation of France during WW2.

While I feel the series suffered a bit following series 6 after Gorden Kaye suffered serious head injuries in a car crash and one half of the original writing team, David Croft, handed off his portion of the writing duties it still managed to bring hilarity to the war effort.

Before the meat, a bit of commentary:

With the total disrespect shown to fans by studios these days with many stalled, incomplete, or abandoned TV series in the marketplace it is refreshing to see a classic completed, especially a BBC series which tend to be higher priced than standard domestic fare.

As anyone who is looking at this item is surely a true fan I'll not bore you with how good the series is.  You already know.  So here is what I know about this release.

First, the Special Features:
  The Best of `Allo `Allo! - Ren and Edith reminisce over old times.
  Cast Biographies

WARNING:

** Spoilers ahead! **

From the package description:
""Ren has great expectations! The end of the war is in sight and he is eagerly anticipating a quick return to normalcy. Unfortunately, this is Nouvion, and normalcy will have to wait while Ren is blown to smithereens, shot in the rear end while disguised as an elk, and kidnapped by Louise to serve as love slave to the Communist Resistance. Meanwhile, Herr Flick undergoes plastic surgery to avoid capture by the Allies, General von Klinkerhoffen hatches another fool-proof plan to assassinate Hitler, and no one can remember where they have hidden the painting of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies. As normalcy recedes further and further into the distance, Michelle plots an escape via the annual fishmonger's parade, and Lieutenant Gruber desperately tries to fix his little tank. Can the end of the war come soon enough to save these desperate fools?""

Episode summaries:

Gone with the Windmill - As the war draws to an end, Gruber and von Strohm return from Spain, their escape attempt having failed. Ren agrees to hide the painting, still missing a boobie, and suggests the Germans fake their own kidnapping by hiding in the windmill, which von Klinkerhoffen has earmarked for target practice. Meanwhile, a heavily bandaged Flick tells Helga he has had plastic surgery to avoid capture by the Allies.

A Tour de France - Captured by the Communists, Ren is looking for a way to escape. Meanwhile, everyone else assumes he has been killed in the windmill explosion. Flick and von Smallhausen are attempting to trick Edith by pretending to be British.

Dead Man Marching - Rens backside is full of buckshot after being mistaken for an elk while escaping from the Communists. He now must lay low or face being re-captured, but in the end decides the safest plan is to turn himself in to the Germans, faking amnesia from the explosion.

Tarts and Flickers - Michelle tries to send important microfilm to England via homing pigeon. When that fails, she decides on using a motorised float in the annual Nouvion Fishmongers Parade. Flick and Von Smallhousen pose as waitresses to search for the painting.

A Fishy Sendoff - It is the day of the annual Nouvion Fishmongers Parade, but von Klinkerhoffen, Gruber and the Colonel are heading to Berlin on a most special mission: to assassinate Hitler with an exploding picture frame.

A Winkle in Time - The Allies have landed, and the Germans are in trouble. While a disguised Gruber and von Strohm attempt to mingle with the villagers, Flick and von Smallhausen try to reach the ocean in a mini-submarine via a secret tunnel under the town... Nouvion, present day. A Mercedes pulls into the square where there is a statue of Ren, the war hero. Old chauffeur von Strohm opens the door for the rich owners Helga and Gruber (now an international art dealer). Inside the cafe is Ren's young adopted son. Ren is being assisted to the toilet by Yvette. Upstairs, an older Mimi attends to the bedridden Edith. Ren is explaining that he never found the painting, when an accident suddenly reveals its hiding place. The painting is now worth millions, but will everyone get their share?

Very highly recommended!",1215734400,17,4304,4.778677462887989
3481526,5,B001B3LIQK,Way too funny.  The subtle intrigue and innuendo is hilarious.,1400025600,,62,5.2

3481528,5,B001B3LIQK,"Allo Allo is one of those comedy, which I can watch over n over.

The first 4 season are hilarious, but latter one it does loose some appeal. I bought all seasons of this awesome show, when I am down sometime, I just pop up the DVD, and it put out smile on my face.

Brit's do make good comedy after all!",1377820800,,304,3.8870967741935485
3481529,5,B001B3LIQK,"This is the last installment of the series. I must say that this and Are You Being Served are two of the funniest shows ever! The writing is excellent, and brings laughter through out the entire series. Highly recomended!",1344211200,,221,4.6923076923076925

3481533,5,B001B3LIQK,"A continuation of the Allo Allo experience. The ""WAP"" is gone which was a bit of a disappointment as I was beginning to like him. One of the servant girls is pregnant by guess who. Lt. Grueber and the Colonel keep getting into trouble with the General and the communist resistance. The painting of the Fallen Modona with the big boobies is still part of the fun only now one of the boobies is missing so they want Helga to expose one of her boobies so a photo can be taken and some how improvised into the painting. I've lost count of how many forgeries there are of the famous painting. I think the producers have too. The 2 British airmen are finally back in England so we don't get to see them any more. Edith continues to show up when Rene has a beautiful girl in his arms and he still manages to explain his way out of it. The undertaker still grabs Edith's butt, an expression of his love for her. On and on it goes. Laugh out loud fun. They just don't make shows like this anymore. What a pity.",1300924800,2,1001,4.191709844559585
3481534,3,B001B3LIQK,Much as I've enjoyed 'Allo 'Allo in the past I regretfully must admit that the last series following the end of WWII is lacking in something from the earlier series. However it has its moments and doesn't detract from the series as a whole. Perhaps the series went on a little too long and tended to appear somewhat stale towards the end. Try the earlier series,1266969600,,361,4.484848484848484

8281712,5,B001B3LIQK,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.

Basic story is of a caf owner Ren; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law.

In series five we get more action from the communist resistance; frankly I think the commie resistance has cuter girls and adds some fresh characters to the mix. And be sure to keep your eye on the homing duck.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.",1423958400,,936,4.592814371257485
