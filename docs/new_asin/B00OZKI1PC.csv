6778862,5,B00OZKI1PC,Frances McDormand gives an amazing performance as Olive Kitteridge. It is difficult not to fall in love with her. She is so real and human. Richard Jenkins is also wonderful as Henry Kitteridge. I appreciate talent like this. The characters stay with you long after the movie ends.,1417305600,10,281,4.875
6778863,1,B00OZKI1PC,"I persevered throughout this entire production, although I wanted to ditch after 20 minutes.  What a sad, pathetic tale.  The main character is a negative, sad, emotionally bereft woman who makes life for all her so-called ""loved-ones"" a misery.  There is no reason to watch this production if you are hoping for any redemption in the end.  There is none - for any of the characters.  I suspect we are supposed to feel sorry for her - some flickering of empathy is supposed to well up for poor Olive.  I suggest, if you have several hours to spend wading your way through this, albeit well-acted but, very sorry tale, save your empathy for the victims of Olive's bitter vitriol.  Her loving (God knows why) husband and long-suffering son.  This is a story that is guaranteed to suck the joy right out of you and leave you wishing you'd followed your instincts with that ""off switch"".  That is, unless you like productions that make you want to shoot yourself.",1417046400,22,959,4.660714285714286

6778866,5,B00OZKI1PC,"I am a fan of Frances McDermond and about 20 minutes into the movie my husband was ready to turn it off. After part 1 we thought, what the heck, and watched part 2, soon to be followed by the rest. The movie has been in my reflections all day. Real life, real thoughts, We LOVED it.",1415577600,39,282,3.9649122807017543
6778867,5,B00OZKI1PC,"Americana as we are not used to seeing it is the overwhelming powerful story of OLIVE KITTERIDGE.  Lisa Cholodenko directs Jane Anderson's screenplay adaptation of American author Elizabeth Strout's 2008 Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The cast is impeccable, with both Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins is roles of a lifetime, and well supported by a sterling cast.

The film is a look at a seemingly placid New England town that is actually wrought with illicit affairs, crime and tragedy, all told through the lens of Olive (Frances McDormand), whose wicked wit and harsh demeanor mask a warm but troubled heart and staunch moral center. The story spans 25 years and focuses on Olive's relationships with her husband, Henry (Richard Jenkins), the good-hearted and kindly town pharmacist; their son, Christopher (John Gallagher Jr.), who resents his mother's approach to parenting; and other members of their community - the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand human drama-desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love. At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, deplores the changes in her little town and in the world at large, but she doesn't always recognize the changes in those around her: a lounge musician (Martha Wainwright) haunted by a past romance;  Olive's own adult child Christopher, who feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and her husband, Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a curse. As the townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive is brought to a deeper understanding of herself and her life-sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless honesty. Olive Kitteridge offers profound insights into the human condition-its conflicts, its tragedies and joys, and the endurance it requires.

There are so many moments of perfect writing and acting that yes, are difficult to watch at the time, but that linger in memory longer after the 2 part 4-hour miniseries lasts. This is what brilliant television and movies could be were it not for the concentration of CGI and firebombs and noisy killing. This is food for the soul. Absolutely brilliant!

6778886,5,B00OZKI1PC,"So well done, great cast, superb storytelling and pace.
Could have been ruined in the hands of another team,
but writers, director and producers did a great job and clearly
loved the story and characters. So pleased that Frances McDormand
bought the movie rights to the book and took on the role of Olive. It's
exciting to see a fully fleshed out female lead, the type of role usually
given to men, the type of personality-type denied women in general, or
denied exists by men who prefer their women one-dimensional. Would really
love to see more productions like this.",1475020800,3,569,4.757575757575758

6778900,4,B00OZKI1PC,"This is really fine TV by my standards.  Not a happy story.  Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins play a married couple experiencing the events of a 25-year span.  None of the characters is pretty physically, nor saintly.  They are real.  Olive herself is a cranky school teacher who cant abide superficiality or sentimentality and does not hesitate to say so.  The series deals with attraction to other people outside the marriage;  raising a son, going through his marriage and divorce and remarriage; depression;  death; crippling illness;  buried secrets; resentmentsjust all the ordinary things of real life.",1468368000,,614,5.3125
6778901,2,B00OZKI1PC,"The film opens with Olive about to commit suicide. Then it goes back 25 years. Olive is a math teacher married to a pharmacist, Henry. Henry is waiting at the table in the morning to give her a small heart shaped box of candy and a card for Valentine's Day. She pays him no attention as she makes coffee. His feelings are hurt. But why didn't he make coffee and serve her breakfast in bed instead of getting candy and a card from his own pharmacy!? How much thought did THAT take?

Olive is a highly unpleasant woman. She's sharp, controlling, irritable and has no patience. However, she feels sorry for certain people and tries to help them. She never wants to show herself being vulnerable. Why? She's apparently having a relationship with the weird school principal who tells her famous quotes.

Henry is the easy-going pharmacist who hires ""cute mouse"" Denise to be his assistant in the  pharmacy. I could swear I have seen this same exact character in another movie, maybe several other movies. Same or similar hairstyle, glasses, voice and personality. Denise is married to Henry, who is crazy about her. Henry the pharmacist invites them to dinner and Olive grudgingly agrees. She jealous of the attention Henry pays to Denise, although she's in love with the weird school principal, and Henry puts up with her like a saint.

When Henry and Henry start talking about going hunting I KNOW what is going to happen. I know where this is going. It's so obvious. And I'm right. When Henry the pharmacist gives Denise a kitten, I KNOW this is also not going to turn out well, and I had to stop watching.

The film (what I saw of it) is very well-acted. But both the story and Olive's character are both highly unpleasant. From the description, I didn't think it was going to be so DARK. I thought it was going to be a more Peyton Place kind of thing. If you are susceptible to depression, do not watch this.",1463961600,,1908,4.551020408163265

Good acting.  Tom Hanks and Ms. McDermott are among the producers.  She's the star. The interior of a marriage and family, I wouldn't have watched it had I known about the whitewashing.

6778907,4,B00OZKI1PC,"The movie is a softer version of the book.  It is as if the HBO series provides the illustrations that are missing from the pages of the book. I like both the series and the book. Watching the series made me ask more questions of the book. Olive reminds me of Melvin Udall, the compulsive writer (played by Jack Nicholson) from the film  ''As Good As It Gets'.  Like Melvin, she can be ruthlessly sharp tongued, but like him, too, she can be extraordinarily insightful and kind.  In the end, both these films found me wishing these two unforgettable shrews well and admiring their will to find their way to a better place, which suggests to me that to understand is to forgive, at least to a certain extent. They did both finally have the grace to know that they needed to change their ways.  I love the way the film compares Olive with other people, taking a close look at those she is kind to, those she verbally slaps, and those who refuse to be bullied by her. The viewer gets to consider both sides of the exchange. Olive has at least one hard lesson to learn in the end, as most of us do, and she sets her face toward learning it, which is a good example for everyone.  In Olive Kitteridge,  Frances McDormand and Elizabeth Strout (the author of the book) have created another great fictional character  -  and a host of really good supporting characters around her.  I couldn't give the HBO version 5 stars because it doesn't encompass the book as much as I would like.  It was, after all, a mini-series.",1458345600,2,1511,4.418772563176895

6778909,5,B00OZKI1PC,"Taking place in the beautiful state of Maine, 'Olive Kitteridge' is a wonderful slice of life story of a hard-nosed, no-nonsense teacher played masterfully by Frances McNormand.  She seems to take everything unemotionally - her son, her good natured husband, the people around her.  The story covers a 25-year time span.  When illness suddenly takes over her husband, the only person she is reservedly close to, one wonders will she continue on in her unfeeling ways, or will she finally crack?  A fine script, stellar actors and just a darn good storyline fill out this can't-stop-watching-it movie.  Watch for a cameo by Bill Murray.",1458172800,,635,5.0673076923076925

6778943,4,B00OZKI1PC,"the film toned down some of Olive's rougher edges, for instance I think in the book she had an affair and admitted hitting her child but in the film she didn't consummate the affair or admit to hitting her son. also the film showed the camaraderie between she and her husband, and between she and her son I think more than the book did. Another change I especially liked was her romantic relationship with the Bill Murray character.  the novel made it seem as if she would've accepted any man of an appropriate age such was her desperation, but the film showed that they clicked and I enjoyed their relationship alot more. great acting.",1446336000,2,636,4.578947368421052

6779014,2,B00OZKI1PC,"This is a brilliantly acted story depicting the life of a woman who lives most of it, for whatever reason, in total despair. As a consequence, she poisons the lives of all of her so-called loved ones to the extent that her son, Christopher (John Gallagher Jnr) grows up emotionally shattered and in need of continual therapy! Somewhat bizarrely, this meat grinder of a life is punctuated by odd moments of compassion for those on its periphery: she cares, sporadically, for her next-door neighbour, who is clearly suffering from some form of mental illness, and the latters son who also grows up with his own severe problems.

Of course, in the lead role of a woman for whom an inner rage appears to be the driving force of her life, Frances McDormand excels as does Richard Jenkins as her long suffering husband, Henry, who, in stark contrast to his wife, is the sort of person who sees good in everyone and brings a ray of sunshine into every room he enters. But don't mistake this for entertainment: it might portray real lives and, as a character study of the form of mental impairment from which Olive almost certainly suffers, its no doubt brilliant, but darkness lies at its core and it revels in its efficient application of misery to the minutiea of everyday life.

Olive seems to resemble the art-loving character from the Woody Allen film, `Play it Again, Sam' in which Woody, who has great trouble approaching members of the opposite sex, is in an art gallery with his friend, played by Diane Keaton. She spots an attractive young woman staring at a Jackson Pollack painting.

Spurred on by Keaton, Woody finally manages to pluck up enough courage to stand beside the young woman and attempts to begin a conversation. For his opening gambit, Woody asks the girl what the painting says to her. She replies: ""It restates the negativeness of the universe; the hideous lonely emptiness of existence; nothingness; the predicament of man forced to live in a lonely, godless universe for all eternity like a tiny flame flickering in an immense void with nothing but waste, horror and degradation forming a useless bleak straightjacket in a black absurd cosmos.""

Undeterred he asks her what she is doing Saturday night. She answers; ""committing suicide"". He responds, ""what about Friday?""

The girls sombre view of existence seems to sum up nicely that of Olives, and more than half the other characters, in this depressive essay on the absurdity of being. If ever I decide that, for whatever reason, I deserve self-flagellation, I'll make sure any self-administered means of escaping this mortal coil are safely locked away and watch the whole thing through again!",1426204800,5,2670,4.872246696035242

Not a 'feel-good' story line, but one so steeped in the drama and (often unintentional) humor of day to day life of these characters, that it provides entertainment on the highest level.  I didn't read the book, but the telling of the story on film is so richly realized, both visually and by all the actors involved--particularly Frances McDormand--that I can't imagine it would be a disappointment to fans of the book.",1423699200,2,476,5.012658227848101

6779043,5,B00OZKI1PC,"This was an HBO miniseries that I was lucky to catch recently on AFN.  It is a wonderful adaptation of the book, OLIVE KITTERIDGE, by Elizabeth Strout.  Frances McDormand is simply outstanding as the austere Olive, who really does have a kind heart, though she hides it well.  One of my favorite character actors, Richard Jenkins, gives a wonderful performance as Henry, Olive's gentle, long-suffering husband.  The story is set in a small New England town (in Maine?).  The townspeople have their own problems, which just adds to the story. The movie examines the themes of sadness, longing, loneliness and depression  In short, it deals with all the complexities of life.  There are no action scenes, no gunfights, no car chases...just a quiet story that will remain with you long after the credits roll.",1420675200,7,806,4.970149253731344

6779045,5,B00OZKI1PC,"This was absolutely fabulous; the terribly sad story of an ostensibly unsentimental, hard-shelled Maine schoolteacher. Beginning with her as a middle-aged woman and following her through into old age, Frances McDormand brilliantly portrays the often 'unexplainable' emotions and behaviours that beset us all. Why is she apparently jealous of her kindly husband's taking a vulnerable young woman under his wing, when she's fed up with him anyway and has feelings for a colleague? Why so sharp towards her son, masking her underlying love for him?
There are so many shallow movies out there, but this really demonstrates the complexities of people's interactions, of depression and loneliness. Can't recommend it highly enough.",1419033600,34,725,5.54054054054054
6779046,5,B00OZKI1PC,"This is the kind of work which feature films used to do best. In recent years we have seen more and more of this solid writing and character portrayal going to tv instead. Now we see Oscar winners eagerly embracing tv work whereas in prior decades they avoided tv at all costs. We are in the second golden era of American television and it is this kind of show which has put us there.

OLIVE KITTERIDGE is the screen adaptation of American author Elizabeth Strout's 2008 Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The wonderful Frances McDormand plays Olive and the equally talented Richard Jenkins plays her husband. They are both well supported by a very able cast. They are lifelong Maine residents. Olive is a teacher and her husband is a pharmacist. We cover the crises in their lives which could occur to anyone. One such crisis is making it through their son's wedding to a thoroughly detestable girl and her equally detestable mother. It is as painful for us to go through this as it is for Olive. Then a student of hers comes back to town. He is on the brink of committing suicide yet Olive intersects with him to see what she can do. There is hereditary madness in his family (so of course he is just about done with his medical training to become a psychiatrist at Columbia). There is also a hunting accident which ruins the husband's employee's life and car crash which removes Olive's best friend from earth. Basically this is a film about ordinary life which shows how even such ordinary lives can be extraordinary.",1418947200,33,1516,4.614814814814815

8685748,5,B00OZKI1PC,"I went in with no idea what to expect of this.  My mom recommended it to me so heartily, I thought I would give it a shot even though I am normally irritated by Frances McDormand.  Well, this miniseries changed my mind.  I think she is excellent.  I was pleasantly surprised to encounter two of my favorites here, Richard Jenkins and Zoe Kazan, both in phenomenal performances.  This miniseries broke my heart yet gently lifted my spirits.  I found myself wanting to shake Olive's character one moment, and relating to her deeply the next.  It is a very surreal show at times but most of the time, incredibly authentic.  It's a masterpiece if you ask me.

Four hours total, and I watched it in two sittings.  Sometimes it takes me days to get through a two hour movie because they just don't hold my interest.  Not true of this one.  Clear your agenda.",1518998400,,852,4.496732026143791

8685750,4,B00OZKI1PC,"Very well acted and maybe too real. I think I will read the book this screenplay originated from because it is that good.  It is funny that there is an assumption that part of the dismal misery of the primary couple is geographically caused. The landscape looked beautiful, we should all be so lucky to live on the east coast.  My one complaint is the sterile, clean and inaccurate portrayal of a non responsive stroke victim, this is not what a locked in stroke victim looks like,it is so much messier. And the nursing homes are so much worse.  I suppose that would be too real.",1515283200,2,579,4.443396226415095

I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and watched the first disc with her (two hours) and I was shocked at how sad and awful it was. Why anyone would enjoy this misery fest is beyond me. Everyone in the film is either nuts or committing suicide or both. I absolutely love Frances McDormand, she's my favorite actress, but if I was her I would have dropped this script in the ocean and run away screaming. The character portrayed by Richard Jenkins, one of my favorite actors, is trapped in the life of an ineffectual loser who'd rather stay married to this hideous cruel heartless harpy than just tell her to shut up, change the locks and move on with his life.

8685756,2,B00OZKI1PC,"Depressing ""relationship"" movie about death, misery and the least sympathetic character imaginable without being a really evil.

Of course, the PC Hollywood leftism has to be injected with a gratuitous canned Rush Limbaugh insult and utterly unbelievable homosexual hugging attitude from the judgemental, intolerant main character.  A category for which she apparently has rabid sentimentality when she has none for her family or anyone else.in person.

But, if you enjoy watching tedious depictions of a sour grapes curmudgeon even Stephen King couldn't make an interesting Maine character as she trudged miserably through life lashing out at everyone (but homosexuals) with equal obdurate spite and bad humor . . .",1498435200,,716,5.5504587155963305
