7799154,1,1578213312,Can't believe that I bought Matthew the movie. It is not complete. The case reads disc one and when you open it is the disk two. Very dissappointed!!!,1428278400,,150,4.392857142857143

7799156,5,1578213312,"Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus is always so incredibly full of heartfelt love and commitment to truth that it's hard to describe.  He is an evangelical protestant, I am a Roman Catholic, it matters not.  This is (perhaps the first) a portrayal of Jesus that takes us into His heart, heals us as we watch (and follow the scripture, verse by verse, as provided on the screen).  I know He is alive because He is alive in me and in my life (sometimes in astonishing ways).  But this portrayal makes Him ALIVE to anyone who sees it.  I don't know why God chose Bruce Marchiano for this particular purpose, but I do know that every single film I've seen (and I've seen a few) where he portrays Jesus has touched me, and is actually in my video library (and I DO NOT collect DVDs!)  God bless you, Bruce.  God blesses anyone who loves his Son and allows Jesus to enter their lives, their homes, through these wonderful films.",1371340800,,924,4.464285714285714

7799158,5,1578213312,"If you cannot go to Israel and sit on the shores of Galilee, this is the next best thing!  Word for word, the book of Matthew, this DVD is giftedly portrays Jesus by Bruce Marchiano.  After watching him as Jesus, I simply couldn't read the gospels the same way!  My kids even love watching it!  A blessing to anyone who views it!  Certainly one you'd want to have in your ""faith"" library!",1294444800,,388,4.333333333333333
7799159,5,1578213312,"What may not be very obvious when purchasing this item is that it is only Part One (disc one) of a two-disc set.  Good luck in trying to purchase only disc two, by which to complete the set.  I had to buy the complete two disc set, so now I own two copies of disc one and one copy of disc two.  Anyone want half of the story?  By the way, the portrayal of Jesus given by Bruce Marchiano is the best I have seen.",1265500800,,411,3.8

7799161,5,1578213312,"I admit to being a bit uncomfortable when I first started watching this DVD.  Jesus was a bit too happy, and a bit too friendly - and he was always smiling - captivatingly smiling!  I kept watching and soon came to see that Jesus was full of compassion, full of love and full of joy!  He wanted everyone to see that He was the Messiah, the one they had been waiting for.  Life was a buzz for him yet all the time the script was faithful to the NIV - no words added, but plenty of 'body language' and it was always positive - love, compassion and joy.

Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is just brilliant, speaking with his eyes as well as the NIV text to show a very human yet Godly Jesus and the narration by Richard Kiley as the aged ""Matthew"" recounting parts of the story adds a real depth and quality to the production.  It is the type of film you want to watch again and again, and in the end, you'll also have memorised lots of the gospel of Matthew as a bonus.  It is a truely captivating film.

I highly recommend this DVD for every person.  It will be mind changing for most Christians who've may never have really thought of Jesus as a flesh and blood person with joy, sadness, patience and frustration in His personality.  These characteristics all come out, and are totally honouring to God.  For non-Christians it will be a very fresh and relevant look at the historic person called Jesus of Nazareth and you won't be able to deny that Jesus is the Son of God, in human flesh.  There is a real warmth about this film and it comes across as real life, with a reality that only a spiritually blind person could deny.

You will not be sorry you bought this DVD and it will broaden your knowledge of Jesus' life and ministry and will bring you closer to God.  It can't help to, it is truly blessed by Him.  Bless you in His Name.",1207699200,7,1830,4.23342939481268
7799162,5,1578213312,Enjoyed this dvd as the dialogue was true to the Bible.  Also the film's characters were so like I thought they would be when reading the New Testament.,1173484800,,152,4.428571428571429
