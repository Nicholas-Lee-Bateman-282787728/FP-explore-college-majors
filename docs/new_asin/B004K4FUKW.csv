4393321,5,B004K4FUKW,""" It's a great Website!"" my son says... We use Amazone.com many times at the year. The ekspedition was OK!",1358812800,,106,4.35
4393322,5,B004K4FUKW,My son wanted this item as he loves dinosaurs!  He thinks it's the greatest!  Grat product and thanks for the quick shipment.,1358380800,,125,4.636363636363637
4393323,2,B004K4FUKW,"This collection feels like they gathered up all the B-list documentaries in hopes they would sell better as a package. Some of the information is even contradictory. I bought this for my daughter who loves dinosaurs, and she really doesn't mind, but I can't recommend this collection to anyone else.",1358121600,5,299,5.0
4393324,4,B004K4FUKW,Grandson is in the dinosaur phase and really enjoys watching the dvds. Better than watching cartoons or other junk on TV.,1355616000,,121,4.809523809523809
4393325,3,B004K4FUKW,Here again is a film which was only okay for me. The biggest reason it was just okay is that I have several films about the dinosaurs and It didn't add a lot to my knowledge mostly due to all the other ones that I have. Still if you don't have a lot of these kinds of films you would probably like this film better than I did and should probably get it as it has a lot of interesting things in it.,1353369600,7,397,3.7951807228915664
4393326,3,B004K4FUKW,"If your child is over 5 years old and interested in dinosaurs, get this.  For a younger child or a child not interested in dinosaurs, this will not hold their interest for long.  It is not as graphic or illustrative as one would hope.  There is a lot of narration and the camera is focused on the scientists while explaining.  There are no cutesy animations.  I think this will be great for my son when he is older and can understand more of the words and comprehend all the wonderful information on this DVD.  Until then, it will collect dust in favor of something a bit more toddler-friendly.",1352246400,12,594,4.453703703703703
4393327,4,B004K4FUKW,"This was on special, so I picked it up to supplement a gift for a 5 year old grandson.  He was transfixed, as was his 7 year old sister.

I'm not big on video babysitting, but I love to see the grandchildren engaged and learning from the experience.  This video is highly recommended (I don't give many 5 star reviews).",1350777600,3,319,4.283333333333333
4393328,4,B004K4FUKW,"I bought this because my 4 year old is obsessed with dinosaurs, I wasn't sure whether he would like it since it was a documentary but overall he has enjoyed watching it.  Parts of the movie are a bit boring but overall it has some great depictions of dinosaurs and it is a movie I can stand to watch with my son without getting to bored.  The collection is long and is on two discs so you might not make it through the whole movie.",1348099200,3,431,4.0588235294117645
4393329,2,B004K4FUKW,"This is a ""collection"" of 3 of the same movie! I would not buy unless it is a singular movie, or maybe 3 different movies. Who needs 3 of the same movie?",1346371200,3,153,3.8125
4393330,5,B004K4FUKW,Great doc. 3 hours of Dinosaurs. Kids loved it!! CGI is nice. Describes how they lived. Hours of entertainment for any Dino fan!!!,1325462400,10,130,4.695652173913044
4393341,5,B004K4FUKW,my five-year-old grandson swears by this... is not a surface cartoon but actually gets into depth of the science of dinosaurs in a way that five-year-old can understand,1465948800,,168,5.035714285714286
4393342,4,B004K4FUKW,Good collection but I had already seen most of the episodes on the National Geo channel. If you are into up to date series on dinosaurs this is a good series.,1461110400,,158,4.129032258064516
4393343,5,B004K4FUKW,bought this for my  son.  He loves the movie.,1452816000,,45,3.888888888888889

4393347,5,B004K4FUKW,"Episode 4. T. rex Autopsy is an exciting collaboration between scientists and model makers. Learn about T. Rex by watching the dissection of a life-like model. Perfect for science classes and dinosaur enthusiasts.

Episode 5 has a great deal of new information on dinosaurs.

Episode 3 is from Jurassic C.S.I. from 4 years ago.",1442707200,,327,5.037037037037037
4393348,5,B004K4FUKW,when our grandson visits over the summer he seeks out all dinosaur shows and so I give you 5 stars for this,1442275200,,107,3.909090909090909

4393361,2,B004K4FUKW,"Outside of the CGI (which is visually stunning) the documentaries ""facts"" are pretty biased when it comes to attempting to demonstrate that Nanotyrannus is a separate genus from Tyrannosaurus. for example the Hands of the ""Nanotyrannus"" specimen while different from Jane do not mean it's an entirely different species (in fact Tyrannosaurus hands are very few) so there not enough to establish if the hand is a result of variation within the species or an actual distinguishable trait for Nanotyrannus.  Unfortunately the specimen used is being studied by VERY few scientists (two of them have fiercely debated for Nanotyrannus almost at a level of zealotry) due to it's private ownership. The reality is it's still an uncertainty and as the Documentary states the only way this will truly be resolved is with a fully grown Nanotyrannus OR a juvenile T.rex that is morphologically different enough from Jane (assuming she is not a Juvenile T.rex herself). If you like Dinosaurs and want to see some cool CGI you'll like it if you want a fair balanced argument for Juvenile T.rex vs. Nanotyrannus skip this.",1435104000,3,1107,5.049180327868853
4393362,3,B004K4FUKW,Enjoyed Dinotasia more but we liked this too.,1426809600,,45,4.75

4393367,3,B004K4FUKW,"lot of mixed reviews here.  probably because of mixture of info presented.  for me, some portions seemed like a rehash or just plain redundant.  on the other hand, there was some decent cgi and info was presented in context.  i'm a dino lover, so it was fun to watch.",1405814400,,267,4.387755102040816
4393368,5,B004K4FUKW,My grandson is going to be so excited when he gets this. Going to be a gift for Easter. Seeing he LOVES his dino's  I have NO DOUBT he is going to FLIP for this movie.,1395792000,,167,3.638888888888889
4393369,5,B004K4FUKW,Highly recommend.  Our grandson loved getting this along with the Discovery Esssential Dinosaur Pack and the When Dinosaurs Ruled.  He watches all of them and even our son said they were really entertaining and well done.,1394582400,,221,5.111111111111111
4393370,4,B004K4FUKW,Graphics are phenomenal! Good information though some is a little out of date nowadays. Would rate five-star but for the continual recounting that was put into the original documentaries for commercial breaks.,1391644800,,209,5.5625
4393381,3,B004K4FUKW,"Less documentary info, but the graphics aren't very good. Not for really for young kid. To dull to hold their attention",1390953600,,119,4.714285714285714
4393382,5,B004K4FUKW,"I love the Dinosaur videos, I own some of the episodes on seperate discs, but this is nice having them on the same disc. You can't beat the topic, Dinosaurs! I am waiting for a disc that shows digging up and explaing how they died and interviewing the Paleoentologists! So many new things, we need an update.",1384473600,,308,4.421052631578948

4393387,3,B004K4FUKW,"The various episodes re-use the same footage from other discovery episodes with different voice overs.
Overall, it was good.
Some of the CGI lacked a little bit, but overall it was worth the money.",1374105600,3,197,4.823529411764706
