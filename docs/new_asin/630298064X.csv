7833000,4,630298064X,"A Western that starts out on the slow side with a card game, the pace picks up after that, and it's also fascinating to see Vicente play the dual role of brothers. It says a lot for him as an actor. Juan, the poor brother, is the Vicente we know and love, but when he plays the rich brother, the body language is so different that I failed to recognize him at first. The voice is so altered that I'm assuming it's being dubbed by another actor, but I may be wrong.
Lucia Mendez looks gorgeous as the love interest of both brothers, and Lalo ""El Mimo"" is his humorous side-kick. Vicente sings 5 songs, but the best song of all is the story of Juan Armenta sung by the old man in the town square...it's fabulous, and that must be little Alejandro who puts a coin in his bowl !
...and once again, we have as is often found in Mexican films, a great ending. Oh that Hollywood would learn from them and give us some good endings !",974937600,2,925,4.144444444444445
