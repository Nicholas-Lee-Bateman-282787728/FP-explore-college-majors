1086521,1,6305869057,"I saw this no-budget wonder as a child and remembered very little. I bought the DVD and now know why. Gloria Talbott finds out she's the title character and freaks out. Boyfriend John Agar tries to help allay her fears but there's a mad killer on the loose in the area and all the evidence points to Gloria. Someone is trying to make her think she's inherited the curse of her father's experiments. The killer sports one of the cheapest make-up jobs you're likely to see in a film of this poor quality. Cheap sets and awful dialogue mark this as a ""quickie"". Talbott and Agar both did their share of low budget horror flicks and they go through the motions as heroine and hero respectively. Ulmer fans may bump this up a couple of notches but it's really a cheap, cheap movie. It's not even very campy. Just dull and really silly.",1030060800,,830,4.431372549019608
1086522,4,6305869057,"Daughter of Dr. Jekyll is a competent if somewhat lacklustre little Saturday-afternoon time-waster for B-horror fans. Personally, I find little evidence of director Edgar G. Ulmer's celebrated genius on display here (sorry Ulmerophiles). The movie never really rises above it's poverty-stricken origins, yet rarely generates genuinely enjoyable Bad Film ambience either. Gloria Talbott (The Cyclops, I Married a Monster from Outer Space) is radiant as Janet Smith [Jekyll], genre icon John Agar is his usual tabula rasa self, and Arthur Shields is annoyingly Barry Fitzgerald-ish as 'kindly' Dr. Lomas. The script by no-budget producer Jack Pollexfen (Neanderthal Man, Indestructible Man, Monstrosity) is strictly pedestrian, a curious hodgepodge of the Jekyll/Hyde story and werewolf/vampire legends, incorporating such hoary devices as the secret passage behind the bookcase and the monster leering at the half-dressed cheesecake model. The embarrassingly corny ""are you sure?"" opener and closer is sure to cling to your brain like an exceptionally irritating TV commercial. The movie also suffers at times from lack of budget (exteriors of the 'mansion' are an all-too-obvious model), although it does boast some terrific-looking cobwebs and atmospheric fog scenes. Keep an eye out for the underutilized though potentially quite effective red/green filter technique employed, if less than stunningly, for the monster's climactic transformations (see Mamoulian's 1932 Jekyll & Hyde, She Devil [1957], or Bava's Black Sunday for its much more effective application). Trivia note: Talbott apparently was co-featured with herself on a double-bill of this movie and The Cyclops back in 1957.
Allday continues their tradition of giving first-class DVD treatment to neglected films with this release. The 1.85:1 letterboxed DVD is mastered from the original 35mm fine grain positive and looks excellent overall in terms of brightness, contrast, sharpness, grayscale, and shadow/highlight detail. There is some sporadic very light speckling and spotting, a few stretches with very minor vertical scratches, and some of the exteriors and fog scenes look a bit soft and grainy, but the source print is still far above average for a film of its type and age. Extras include an overall excellent-quality, lightly speckled trailer; isolated music and effects track; still and poster gallery; and on-camera monologues by John Agar (9 mins) and Arianne Ulmer Cipes (16 mins). Ms. Cipes discusses the preservation/legal issues involved with the movie and DVD release, recalls producer Jack Pollexfen, and compares today's indie filmmakers with Ulmer in his pioneering early years. Agar reminisces about his early John Ford films and Universal-era SF flicks, relating precious little about DoDJ; genre fans who read 'zines like Scarlet Street, Psychotronic Video, or Filmfax regularly will learn virtually nothing new in his segment. The movie is gets 3 stars, the DVD package rates 4 or 5.",1009584000,5,2976,5.630289532293987
1086523,4,6305869057,"The DVD release of ""Daughter of Dr Jekyll"" is one of those guilty pleasures fulfilled for fans of 1950's science-fiction and horror films. Fans of director Edgar Ulmer's similar output in this decade (think  of ""Man from Planet X"" or ""The Amazing Transparent  Man"") will enjoy this outing, and will expect to see the work of a  stylist struggling against a meager budget. The film stars sci-fi veterans  John Agar and Gloria Talbot, but perhaps the real star is the overworked  fog machine ulmer uses to try to hide some obvious sets and models. The  disc has its fair share of extras, including a trailer, posters/stills, an  interesting monologue from John Agar, and an isolated music/effects track.  the music is seemingly composed of cues from other sources...die-hard fans  will recognize the recurring theme from ""Robot Monster"". Picture  quality in all indoor shots is very sharp; some of the outdoors scenes are  a bit fuzzy but add to that late-night television feel where most of us  probably first saw the movie. Very enjoyable.",961200000,16,1039,4.976744186046512

The indoor sets are fair, the outdoor sets are very fog-laden so as to mask their failings.  The story is OK, but the movie itself is not thrilling like other films from the era.  Still, a adequate time-passer.  The Allday Entertainment DVD release is very good and probably the best available.  Recommended for fans of films of this kind.",1394236800,,489,4.705882352941177

7897453,3,6305869057,"I bought the three pack mainly for ""Daughter of Dr Jekyll"" and ""Bluebeard"". I first saw Daughter of Dr Jekyll on late night television in the late sixties, you know,five minutes of movie cut with ten minutes of commercials and horror host praddle. The actual amount of movie shown was about 49 minutes with  about 10 minutes cut to fit an hour and a half show format. I always wanted to see it in it's entirety. When claiming a kinship with Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde it's really a remake of the 1946 Universal Horror Mystery ""She Wolf of London"". Edgar Ulmer, who was crowned ""King of the B Movies"" Director by his fans, was the perfect choice to helm this one. Gloria Talbott portrays ""Janet Jekyll, the Dr's offspring and heir to his estate,John Agar plays her fiance George, and Arthur Sheilds[the younger brother of Barry Fitzgerald] plays her guardian and the village doctor Lomis.  There is damn little about a potion which divides the dual nature of man into two separate and distinct entities, and a whole lot about werewolf and vampire lore. Jekyll is even referred to as a werewolf and its strongly suggested that the condition is hereditary and Janet herself will become a werewolf. Janet starts dreaming about becoming a wolf woman during the full moon and awakens the next morning with her nightgown torn and muddy and bloodstains on hands and the gown. At first George and Dr Lomis assure her that she is just hysterical, but the body count starts to rise and the villagers,led by the sinister oaf John Dierkes, figure on driving a stake through Janet's heart as they did her father many years before, thus ending the curse and the murders. It becomes pretty obvious early on that Janet has some connection with the murders and she becomes convinced that she is the werewolf who is murdering the villagers, but is she really? It's not hard to figure out who the real murderer is.
  Ulmer's trademark was taking sow's ears and making silk purses out of them. While ""Daughter"" ain't no silk purse, he manages to provide some creepy atmosphere and watch ability to the proceedings. He also gets a pretty good performance from Ms Talbott and a scene chewing but professional performance from Mr Sheilds. Not even John Ford could get any acting from John Agar and he does his usual space occupying and dialog recitation with only a marginal connection with what is going on in the scene. Despite Ulmer's legendary ability to cover cheap sets and props with a sinister dark and foggy look, there are several scenes that look as though they were shot on a budget of $5.25. There are a few moments that are meant to be eerie but wind up being laughable and some dull stretches but the climax is fun if not frightening.
  If you are an Edgar Ulmer fan, or you like guilty pleasure 1950's horror schlock, you will probably get a kick out of ""Daughter of Dr Jekyll"". Thought not digitally remastered, its a fairly clear print with good sound and you will probably see it with more clarity then alot of the drive-in audiences did in 1957 and 58. I give it three and a half stars out of five, but then I always had a ""thing"" for Gloria Talbott.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edgar-G-Ulmer-Archive/dp/B0000639GB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edgar G.

7897455,4,6305869057,"The Daughter of Dr. Jekyll ?

Powerful.

Don't write this off as a cheesy 50's ""B"" movie

I recently viewed this film again after not seeing it for maybe-45 years?
It scared the daylights out of me back then, and still does.

Actually, of all the Jekyll & Hyde  films out there, did any of them remotely mention or hint that Dr. Jekyll had ANY children?? I didn't think so.

Definitely a well written, true horror film made when filmmakers & writers actually placed forth efforts, to frighten viewers.

Yeah, it is a low-buck film but if you concentrate closely, it has the same psychological impact as the old, 60's Outer Limits B&W classics.

Powerful acting, effects, makeup & screenplay for a film of this age.

-Definitely projects nightmare content...After all, isn't that the reason
we view these??",1200268800,3,805,4.77536231884058

7897457,5,6305869057,"Gloria Talbott was the Connie Francis of ""B"" movies in the 1950s. Having appeared as a child performer in the late 1930s, Gloria's heyday was in the 50s, appearing in several films, including ""The Cyclops"", ""The Leech Woman"", the infamously titled ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"", and, of course,""Daughter of Dr. Jekyll"", directed by legendary B-movie director Edgar G. Ulmer (""The Black Cat"", ""Detour"",""Bluebeard""). The setting is early 1900s England. The shapely, dark-haired and big-eyed Gloria plays plays Janet Jekyll (No, I'm not kidding!) who, having turned 21, returns to her ancestral home with her new husband John Agar,(No, I'm not kiddding!) to claim her inheritance. Janet, who has always thought her last name was ""Smith"" (No, I'm not kidding!) learns of her true name, and of her infamous father. Kindly(?) Dr Lomas, played by Arthur Shields, who was Barry Fitzgerald's real-life brother  (No, I'm not kiddding!) is the executor of her late father's estate. Janet begins to be plagued by terrible nightmares, in which she has inherited her father's curse of lycanthropy (No, I'm not kiddding!), and attacks and kills young girls in her nocturnal prowlings. She wakes up with bloodstains on her nightgown, and learns that indeed, young girls have been murdered by a ferocious creature. Janet begins to doubt her own sanity....""Daughter of Dr. Jekyll"" is a guilty pleasure, filmed on an obviously low budget, with spartan sets, ludicrous dialogue and costumes (John Agar's hideous striped jacket looks like one of John Payne's cast-offs from ""Hello, Frisco, Hello"", and one victim looks straight out of a Frederick's of Hollywood catalogue, in her black corset), and my favorite scene is in which Ms. Talbott and Mr. Agar are having breakfast, and through the lace-curtained window, one can see 1950s cars zipping down the street! (No, I'm not kiddding!) Also in the cast is the craggy and very American John Dierkes as ""Jacob"", a surly and suspicious handyman who always talks about ""the lads"" in the pub, and is laboriously carving out a wooden stake to plunge through ""The werewolf Jekyll's heart"" (No, I'm not kiddding!)The picture quality and sound on this DVD are superb, so one can really appreciate the tinsel sets and the aforementioned ""breakfast scene"" in their digitally enhanced crispness. There is also an interview with the late John Agar on the DVD, and a gallery of poster art and lobby cards. It's wonderful that such enjoyable, fun ""junk"" like this is treated with such reverence, and to give Mr. Ulmer his due, his films were never dull, and considering the miniscule budgets he had to work with, he delivered the goods, even though they were more than a little ridiculous. So, park yourself on your sofa with some refreshments, and enjoy ""Daughter of Dr. Jekyll"". ..... (sinister laugh) ""Are you sure?"" Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!",1046304000,9,2885,5.151385927505331
