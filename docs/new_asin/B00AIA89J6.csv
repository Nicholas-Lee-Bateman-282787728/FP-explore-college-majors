This 3 disc DVD set is the bonus material that is included in the new 20 DVD Stooges box set. I do not believe that this set is truly being sold separately by Sony at this point in time. I think this set has been broken out of the 20 DVD box set and is being sold at a ridiculously high price to take advantage of those who purchased the 8 Stooges volumes, and do not wish to buy the 20 disc set just to get the bonus films. Note that this set is NOT being sold by Amazon, but rather by private sellers attached to Amazon. This set is also NOT being sold in retail stores, and to me that is a giveaway as to where these sets being sold separately are coming from. I have no idea if Sony plans to sell this 3 DVD set separately in the future, but as of right now I think I'm going to wait.",1340841600,17,1020,4.795454545454546
5426090,5,B00AIA89J6,"This is the extra set that comes with the big box, sold as an individual piece for those of us Stooge fans who already bought the separate sets. While no one can argue with the plethora of content inside, I have to say that $45 for this set is a bit excessive, as most of the box sets themselves can be had for less. I am grateful that it was sold as a lone set and not just a box exclusive, and I thank Sony for that, but the price is a bit out of line. Thanks again, Sony, for the set. But the cost deserves a firm eye-poking!",1339718400,20,528,3.853211009174312

Shemp was one of the original stooges who worked with Ted Healey. Shemp had quit the act because of Healey's drunken and violent behavior. He did pretty well on his own.

5426147,3,B00AIA89J6,"This collection is a true pleasure, as it actually contains what it advertises - rare material.

The 1945 Musical is better than what one might expect - Columbia always excelled at anachronistic comedy and here we have another entertaining example - hard to tell if we are in the old west or the new west (represented by the new ""western Swing"" music) but it's light fun and the script is excellent. We have a toned down Curly and Larry parring with a restrained Moe (the slaps come at bigger intervals) named Shorty here, hair combed back, an old time prospector who's time has about run out...until he meets the boys in a saloon where they magically win a casino game. the loot keeps them safe from ever-encroaching law enforcement. Shorty vouches for them - he will ensure their exit from town tomorrow - as they join a big team to look for precious metals out in them thar hillz.

As musicals go, it's pretty good. At times, an odd combination of Tin Pan Alley and Western Bop (with the real Spade Cooley and others, in the spirit of Bob Wills, et. al). And all that ""rockin'"" business holds  extra interest in that, yes, a new form of music was on the way, rockabilly! Watching these bands play, with nice, tight close ups on the players, gives us a foretaste of what Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins would accomplish a decade later.

I did not watch HAVE ROCKET on this package...but confess to watching it in a theatre in 1959 (and perhaps once all the way through on TV, since). Not bad at all, with a zany screenplay and some nice inventiveness. But like every single one of the Stooges features at the time, should have been much funnier. So, if you'll allow, I'll put that one aside for now. Shouldn't detract from the rating.

Moving on to the Shemp series I have to say I enjoyed every one, save the remake of A PLUMBING WE WILL GO. Couldn't cut it, sorry. But the big news for me is that all of the other selections are good to very good and make us wonder why (we assume) they were rarely, if ever shown on TV! Several are better than some Stooge films of the era! And even better: we get a chance not only to see more of Shemp, as wild and crazy as ever, but also Christine McIntyre! Their best scenes together, such as in BRIDE AND GLOOM, make one imagine what a TV series might have looked like with them as stars. All the ""Stooge players"", in fact, get a lot of frame-time..and ofcourse this means for longtime fans, the chance to watch something close to, unreleased Three Stooges! We see a lot of Vernon Dent and even some small bits with Bud Jamison and Emil Sitka and the actor who played the Palace guard in ""Malice in the Palace"". The okay remake of PUNCH DRUNKS nonetheless features none other than Charles Rogers, of Hal Roach Studios! He plays the violin man.

I also wonder if Jackie Gleason may have gotten his idea for ""Charlie Bratton"" from the Shemp short, MR. NOISY, or ""Rudy, The Repairman"" from the remake of the 1936 Stooges film where they played exterminators.

Moving on to Joe Bessor's stuff: there is exactly one good entry...but it's very good! In fact, I can say it's one of the best shorts Columbia ever put out, called WAITING IN THE LURCH (1949), where he plays the eccentric rich kid who is able to live out his childhood fantasy of being a master fire fighter! This ""obsession"" nearly ruins his marriage to Christine McIntyre - Vernon Dent plays the - yes, irate - Father. The slapstick is played down and we have a very agreeable, I daresay, sophisticated comedy. There's even a remake here, from 1954, and with Christine! It has about five minutes of new footage...but this surely must be of interest to Stooge-McIntryre fans, who might assume she left the Stooges (and show business) around 1950.

The remainder of Bessor's stuff...as we say, it's here for ""historical reasons"". He's a great character actor but the material is beyond lame. He must have been thrilled to ""redeem"" himself, when he got to work work with Abbott and Costello in that one brilliant sitcom season on TV, 1951-52.

The historians can now see that (most likely) it was no big stretch to find and sign Bessor as Shemp's replacement...as he had been part of the Columbia family for years.

Also included some interesting but decided uninspired Joe De Rita footage; three cartoons.

{quality is excellent}.

{wonder if Sony can look even deeper into the vaults for the ""lost"" Curly cameo of 1949?}.",1373846400,4,4419,4.551637279596977
5426148,5,B00AIA89J6,"I received these discs as part of the complete Three Stooges box set. The quality level of the prints is fantastic and you're not likely to find many of these solo shorts anywhere else. I must confess that Have Rocket Will Travel is a fond treasure from my childhood (I was seven when it came out) and even though it is a silly film, it always makes me smile. Having passed through the age when I looked down on the violent, unsophisticated antics of the Three Stooges, I have come to appreciate what extraordinarily talented performers Larry Fine and Moe, Jerry and Shemp Howard were. Joe De Rita and Joe Besser, although not quite up to the level of their predecessors, were delightful in their own way. Grab this set while you can as it will probably have a short shelf life.",1373241600,4,778,4.485915492957746

5426152,4,B00AIA89J6,"Well,I bought this because I have seen all of the 3 Stooges shorts,and the material here (Other than ""Have Rocket Will Travel"") I had never seen before. I was shocked to see that the Shemp, Joe Besser ,and Joe DeRita shorts were all produced by Columbia AND feature such ""Stooge alumni "" like Vernon Dent,Bud Jamison,Christine McIntyre,Emil Sitka and many others that I recognized but don't know their names. Shemp even did a remake of Stooges classic ""Punch Drunks"".They even ""borrowed"" stock footage from that short and re-used it in this one. Look close and you can see Larry Fine in a few scenes. Shemp's films were OK,overall. Serious ""stooge fans"" will be interested to see Shemp ""driving"" in several of these shorts. In real life Shemp never drove-he crashed a car as a teenager-and was afraid to ever drive again. Not a Joe Besser fan,but who is? Joe DeRita is in here with slicked hair,kind of reminded me a little of Lou Costello. This DVD set is not a laugh riot,but it was interesting to watch. Too bad Columbia didn't allow Shemp to work with his brothers. They must have been filming right next to each other on the lot.",1364428800,3,1134,4.646766169154229
5426163,4,B00AIA89J6,"This is a very nice collection of rare Three Stooges shorts and two feature films on three DVDs. The feature films were good and I had seen them both before. The real treats in this set are the short subject films with Shemp, Joe Besser and Curly Joe DeRita. Fans of the Stooges will see many of the supporting actors featured in the Three Stooges short films in these shorts as well. My only complaint is the packaging. The three DVDs are stacked one on top of the other and one must remove the top DVDs to get to the ones undernneath. For the price of this collection better packaging would have helped. This is a must have for all Three Stooges fans.",1359590400,,653,4.317073170731708
5426164,4,B00AIA89J6,"At long last Columbia dips into the vaults & releases the solo works of Shemp Howard, Joe Besser and Joe Derita after who knows how many years of clamoring by stooge fanatics. Thrown in to boot are a couple of features, ""Rockin in the Rockies"" and ""Have Rocket, Will Travel"".

""Rockin in the Rockies"" is a somewhat pleasant feature starring a bunch of singing and dancing acts I'm sure not too many people have heard of or will remember once the feature is over. Whoever penned this film also had the ""brilliant"" idea to split up the stooges as Moe plays a character called Shorty Williams with his hair combed back (kind of distracting) while Larry and Curly play a two-man team although the three do come together quite often and some stooge antics are on display in spots throughout the movie. Not as terrible as some people have made it out to be but no great shakes either.

""Have Rocket"" was the boys first starring feature at Columbia after their resurgence in popularity during the late 1950s & seems expressly aimed at a kids audience. In fact, some (like myself) would say the problem with the stooges of the late 50s and 1960s is that somehow the boys got pegged as being just childrens entertainers. Of course, watching the short subjects that made them legends in the first place would throw cold water on that idea, but nonetheless we get a movie with a talking unicorn of all things (as if the talking horses of the Besser era wasn't bad enough). Not the greatest start off to the Joe Derita era but not a total waste either.

Disc 2 is where we really get the goods. The solo works of Shemp Howard. One theme that seems prevalent through a lot of the Shemp solos is the ""jealous husband"" gimmick and it may get tiring after awhile but Shemp still manages to give the material some sparkle, even in one of the weaker outings like ""Pick a Peck of Plumbers"" with the comically challenged El Brendel. Best of the lot includes ""Where the Pest Begins"" and ""Mr. Noisy"".

Disc 3 includes the solo works of Besser and Derita and depending on your fondness (or lack thereof) of those two as stooges, these solo features may not sway your opinion of them in one way or the other, although I will say Besser could be a cute little man in his own way. And yes, you will get the feeling of deja-vu watching some of the later 1950s Besser shorts which were stock footage remakes of the 1940s films and are about the same quailty as the Shemp three stooges remakes which is to say they are mostly mediocre.

Overall, I would say I was satisfied with my purchase although I'm not sure I would recommend this set for a stooge novice. It seems like mostly the hardcore stooge nuts such as myself will enjoy this set. 4 stars",1358294400,8,2721,4.455823293172691
5426165,4,B00AIA89J6,If you're a Stooge fan and acquired all 9 volumes of the Stooges on DVD then here you go with the rest of the best from the vaults to bring it home.  Thanks Sony.  The boys deserved the best and you delivered the best.,1358121600,2,218,3.9318181818181817
5426166,3,B00AIA89J6,"If you are hoping to get something near the quality of the various sets of Three Stooges shorts, forget it, as this is a big disappointment, made all the more galling as it costs more than they do.

But really, this is not worth getting on its own.  The films in this set that include the three stooges are all substandard, and none of the separate work here is up to their standards either.  Shemp is fine in his shorts, but the material lets him down, as do some of the other actors in some of them.

Really, this is a big disappointment.  Sony did do a good job of mastering it, so you can see the lame films in great clarity, but I advise you to spend your money elsewhere instead, as this is for collectors only.  I doubt many people will watch anything in this set very often.",1353542400,2,1195,4.974874371859296

The first DVD is compromised of two feature films starring the boys, and three color cartoons whose tenuous addition has been justified by brief (and I mean brief as in seconds) appearances of cartoon versions of The Three Stooges.  The first film, ""ROCKIN' IN THE ROCKIES"" (with Curly) has Moe as a separate character, with Larry and Curly as two bumblers whose characters barely make sense in the plot except for lame comic relief.

He died of a heart attack in prison, just before the warden had a chance to tell him that he'd been pardoned by then Gov. Ronald Reagan!  Their one song is blazzin' and the steel guitarist is amazin' (sorry)! The second film, ""HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL"" (with Curly Joe) is more of a children's film, with a sorry-ass unicorn, a giant fire-breathing Venusian tarantula and an all-knowing computer that would make Robbie The Robot loose his oil!  A few recycled routines are used, the Stooges whip up a batch of rocket fuel, like the youth formula they made in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubble-Trouble/dp/B001OXLGKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Bubble Trouble""</a>, and the movie ends with the boys mingling with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoi-Polloi/dp/B00151QYYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Hoi Polloi""</a>.  The only interesting cartoon is the beautifully colored ""Bon Bon Parade,"" one of those unintentionally psychedelic ""inanimate objects come to life"" concoctions.

DVD #2 contains fourteen Columbia Comedy Shorts with Shemp Howard, five in a supporting role, and nine as the star.  Of the first five, there are three starring Andy Clyde, who started with Mack Sennett and was hired by Columbia Producer Jules White in 1934.  He made numerous shorts all the way to 1956. He was the longest standing comedian under contract to Columbia after the Stooges.  He later co-starred in the first ""rural comedy"" hit TV show ""The Real McCoy's"" with Walter Brennan.  They're good for a chuckle or two, and Clyde was a subtler actor than most in the Columbia comedy stable.  The other two were from the ""Glove Slingers"" series, with one starring Noah Beery, Jr.  Considering that many of the writers, producers, directors, etc. also worked with the Stooges it's not surprising to catch the recycled bit or two, as in ""Pleased To Mitt You,"" when an oven mitt becomes part of an iced cake.  The best Shorts starring Shemp are ""Pick A Peck Of Plumbers,"" ""Open Season For Saps"" and ""Where The Pest Begins.""  In ""Plumbers"" Shemp, along with Swede comic El Brendel, are offered $100 to find a missing diamond ring lost in the bathroom sink drain.  Although obviously inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Plumbing-We-Will-Go/dp/B00151QYYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""A Plumbing We Will Go""</a>, the mayhem that ensues actually seems funnier.  In ""Open Season"" Shemp (with a moustache!), as Woodcock Throckmorton (slipped by the censors there!) has marital troubles caused by his membership in the ""Hoot Owls;"" so he takes wifey on a vacation and gets involved in the old ""wife and woman with a jealous husband mix-up"" plot. The surprise ending though, is well...a hoot!  ""Pest"" has know-it-all Shemp either almost killing co-star Tom Kennedy, or giving him a nervous breakdown with his ""help.""  Many of the supporting players in the Stooges Shorts are featured throughout Discs 2 and 3, Christine McIntyre, Vernon Dent, Emil Sitka, Bud Jameson and Joe Palma, to name a few.  There are also quite a few lousy remakes of Three Stooges classics, with Shemp ""Punch Drunk"" when listening to ""Pop Goes The Weasel,"" or as an exterminator mistaken for a professional escort.  And there's WAY too many jealous wife/husband plots.

Disc #3 has ten Comedy shorts starring Joe Besser, and four starring Joe DeRita.  The best Besser Short is ""Waiting In The Lurch,"" where he plays a wealthy eccentric ""fire chaser,"" complete with butler, firefighter gear and a fire pole in his study reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BATMAN/dp/B001RXB49K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BATMAN</a>!  Late on his way to marry Christine McIntyre (there MUST be something wrong with him!) due to a fire, her father (Vernon Dent) tries to scuttle their romance, and hilarity ensues.  Sorry to say, it's all downhill from there.  After watching the first five Besser Shorts, the rest made me question my memory, until I realized that all of the five later Shorts were remakes of the first five, ala the recycled Shemp Shorts the Stooges made!  With only new intros and outros, the only redeeming factor is that Shorts six to ten are in 1.85:1 Amamorphic Widescreen.  The DeRita Shorts are very disappointing.  Except for the thankfully upbeat closer, ""Jitter Bughouse,"" you're overwhelmed with mediocrity.

Packaged in one of those horrible snap cases that have all three DVD's on one spindle (that I first encountered in Columbia/Sony's 3DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HAMMER-FILMS-The-Icons-of-Suspense-Collection/dp/B0034PWPHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HAMMER FILMS: The Icons of Suspense Collection</a>), and with NO plot summations whatsoever like those on the back of all The THREE STOOGES COLLECTION's DVD cases, this set is sad indeed.  While the films and shorts themselves have been beautifully remastered with nary a speck of damage, the content explains why it's been unreleased until now, to be used as a tool to separate Stooge's fans from their hard earned cash.  While this set might be a boon to the collector or film historian, I would recommend the curious to hold on to their THREE STOOGES COLLECTION sets, and try to borrow this from the library, or rent it from a streaming service before committing to purchase......",1349049600,12,7403,6.169260700389105
5426168,5,B00AIA89J6,"The quality of these shorts from the 1930's-1940's are in SUPERB quality!
I never knew Shemp made so many solo shorts, him with any Clyde as very funny!
The Joe DeRita shorts are good too, he made a good replacement for Curly and Shemp. I never was a fan of Joe Besser, he just came off as too whimpy and gay like, but to each his own.
It also includes full length movies. For the new price cut, this DVD set is well orth the price and a welcome addition to any Stooge fan's collection!",1346630400,,486,4.126315789473685
5426169,5,B00AIA89J6,"Vintage-comedy fans will be sorely tempted to grab this new Stooge set. All of the ""third Stooges"" are featured here: Curly Howard (seen in one feature film), Shemp Howard (as a supporting player in five shorts, and starring in nine more), Joe Besser (in all 10 of his 1949-56 Columbia shorts), and Joe DeRita (in his four 1946-48 shorts, as well as his first Three Stooges feature).

The Curly Howard contribution is unfortunately one of the Stooges' weakest films: ROCKIN' IN THE ROCKIES, a Western-themed musical that has Moe in a character role as ""Shorty"" and Curly and Larry as a mildly amusing two-man team. Curly is in declining health here, so there isn't much sparkle. Completists will be glad to see more Curly footage, but casual fans of Curly may shrug their shoulders at this one.

Many Stooge fans have come to appreciate the creative comedy of Shemp Howard in recent years, and this assortment won't disappointment them. It features almost every two-reeler Shemp did for Columbia before being drafted for the Stooge series. The earliest exhibits have Shemp as a boorish foil for Mack Sennett veteran Andy Clyde. HOME ON THE RAGE, MONEY SQUAWKS, and BOOBS IN THE WOODS are standard Columbia gagfests with Shemp's stream-of-consciousness ad libs contrasting nicely with Andy's subtler bits of business. There are also two Glove Slingers comedies, with Shemp among the handlers of a likable young boxer; watch Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams openly breaking character at Shemp's improvisations in PLEASED TO MITT YOU. In 1944 Columbia began starring Shemp in his own shorts, sometimes making him part of a team. He and Swedish-dialect comic El Brendel don't quite mesh in PICK A PECK OF PLUMBERS, but dumb-ox comic Tom Kennedy makes a better foil in JIGGERS, MY WIFE and SOCIETY MUGS. Fans will note a Three Stooges connection in A HIT WITH A MISS, a remake of the early Stooge comedy PUNCH DRUNKS, with Shemp as a prizefighter who goes nuts whenever he hears ""Pop Goes the Weasel""; the story is credited to ""Howard, Fine, and Howard."" By 1946 Shemp was established as a Columbia star comic: MR. NOISY (a remake of Charley Chase's THE HECKLER, even better with Shemp) and BRIDE AND GLOOM demonstrate that he could have gone on indefinitely as a solo performer.

Joe Besser's whiny, tantrum-prone character is an acquired taste best enjoyed in moderation, which may explain why he only made one or two shorts a year for Columbia. The last four shorts are low-budget remakes of the first four! Clever scripting and editing match the newly filmed scenes to the older ones, but you'll see lots of the same footage. One very novel and eye-catching diversion is that the DVD shows the later shorts in the widescreen format, and it's amazing to see how well composed the older, pre-Cinemascope footage is when intercut with the newer wide shots.

Joe DeRita was an ex-burlesque comedian playing minor roles in minor movies when Columbia signed him for a brief series in 1946. His character at that time has been aptly described by authors Ted Okuda and Ed Watz as ""the poor man's Lou Costello,"" and you'll see hard-luck Joe having slapsticky domestic problems in the usual Columbia manner. Of special interest is JITTER BUGHOUSE, teaming Joe with The Novelites, a zany musical-comedy trio seen in the concurrent Columbia feature I SURRENDER DEAR. The DVD set also includes Joe DeRita's first appearance with Moe and Larry, the 1959 kiddie-matinee feature HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL.

The frosting on the cake is a trio of color cartoons featuring caricatures of the Stooges.

Stooge fans will recognize the same familiar character players in support: Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre, Jean Donahue (later known as Jean Willes), Bud Jamison, Philip Van Zandt, Dick Wessel, Emil Sitka, Esther Howard, Bruce Bennett, John Tyrrell, etc. Print quality across the board is fabulous. This is a little sad in a way, because these solo shorts never received as much exposure as the Three Stooges shorts and have been largely forgotten. Fortunately for us, the mere fact that they weren't handled so often means they still look like new today. Sony Pictures' Grover Crisp can take a bow for these dazzling restorations, and Mike Schlesinger deserves our thanks for making these rarities available.

Yes, Stooge fans, you need the solo shorts. Eleven hours of fun await you.",1345593600,33,4359,4.97119341563786
5426170,3,B00AIA89J6,"As many have previously mentioned, this volume has not been released independently of the ""Ultimate Collection"" box set but you can find it separately through individual resellers.  If you can find it for an okay price (as I did), this is a collection worth having.

It is a wildly mixed bag, however.

The Curly stuff:  ""Rockin' in the Rockies"" inexplicably breaks the team up, neutralizing them somewhat.  Moe appears as a character named ""Shorty"" and Larry & Curly act as a team.  This was filmed just as Curly's health was taking a turn for the worst but he's in good form here.  But the material generally lets them down.

The Curly-Joe DeRita stuff:  While it's nice to have ""Have Rocket, Will Travel,"" it's really one of their weaker efforts from the DeRita period.  Cute but underwhelming.

The Joe Besser shorts:  Besser's spoiled sissy kid act gets old fast and I've noticed a marked inability for him to relate to his co-stars.  It's as if he's so inside his own head, calculating what his next comedic move will be, he forgets to actually interact with his co-stars.  He's as guilty of that here as in his Stooges shorts.

The Joe DeRita shorts:  I never felt DeRita's gently befuddled/bemused persona was a good match for the Stooges and he doesn't bring much juice to his solo shorts, either.  His characterization is far too mild for the knockabout slapstick situations Jules White places him in.  However, he's low key and (for some) charming and FAR LESS irritating than Besser.

The Shemp shorts:  THESE are the jewels of this collection and validate the purchase.  Shemp (as evidenced when he re-joined the Stooges) knew his way around this type of material (broad, violent slapstick) and approached it with the aggression and conviction needed to make the jokes sing (unlike Besser & DeRita who are far too submissive for this type of humor).  The best of his shorts are ALMOST on par with his Stooges efforts.

What one is struck by most when watching these solo shorts is how magical the Stooges timing really was.  We see many of the same situations and jokes here that the Stooges would employ but it just isn't the same as when they were in the boys' hands.  Still, for historical value alone, this is a great release.  As far as quality of entertainment, I can say that I will be revisiting the Shemp efforts in the future but can't see myself sitting down to the Besser and DeRita efforts any time soon.",1344384000,20,2430,4.685579196217494
5426171,5,B00AIA89J6,"Love this DVD. It's really long overdue that the Three Stooges films be made available to the public, and now that it's happened, it's good to finally be able to see the solo performances of Shemp, Joe Besser and Curly-Joe DeRita. These films are indeed treasures to have. Most Stooge fans appreciate the work of Shemp, and watching his solo comedies gives us more understanding why some considered him to be the funniest man in Hollywood. The work of Besser and DeRita is sadly underestimated. They too were very funny comics in their day, and this disc provides evidence of that. While the cost for these is high, I find that it was worth every dollar.",1342396800,3,654,4.646551724137931
5426172,5,B00AIA89J6,"I bought this for the rare Stooges jem, ""Rockin' in the Rockies"". What made this so enjoyable were disks 2 and 3 which had Shemp, Joe Besser and Joe DeRita individual comedy shorts. Take note of the directors and enjoy their individual styles. My enjoyment surpassed my expectations. If you know a Stooge fan, invite them over for a unique angle.",1340928000,2,346,4.688524590163935
8552000,3,B00AIA89J6,I loved The Three Stooges as a kid.  But after I was grown they didn't do that much for me.  Sort of like growing up and finding out that wrestling was fake.  Have Rocket Will Travel is featured on this and it was one of my favorite movies of theirs.  And I can still watch every once in awhile.  The thing with this set of dvds.  Is it has all the different combinations of the stooges.  Larry Moe and Curly were my favorite.  And Curly my favorite of them.  You can watch this and see how much comedylike the times have changed.  And not really for the best.,1522368000,,560,4.101851851851852
