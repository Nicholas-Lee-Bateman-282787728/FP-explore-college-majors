8296616,2,6304617224,"This tape has 2 episodes of the 70's live-action Spidey show that have a whole 2 characters from the original comix. Spidey (i would hope!) and J. Jonah. The baddies are generic. Thats right no Green Goblin, no Doc Ock, no  nobody! Instead Peter uses his reporter skills to act as a Nancy Drew/Hardy  Boy type sleuth and investigate insipid crimes and then catch the baddies  by turning into Spidey for an entire 5 min. an episode. He doesnt even bust  one joke! An J.J.J. is bald! Although his is the only character thats is  played with any real enthusiasm.
So even though this blows, just seeing  ol' Webs in live-action swingin' from buildings and kickin' buttock just  brings a smile to my face.
Cant wait for Spider-Man: The Movie in  2001!!!!!!",938736000,4,751,4.636363636363637
