8144735,1,B000IBUYSE,"being a huge instrumental guitar fan I saw this at a bargain price of $5 today and picked it up. I'd heard about Esteban being on TV regularly and  was intrigued.  Well....he's a chubby guy dressed all in black with sunglasses and a black hat...I guess his thing is all about style over substance because as a guitarist he's not great....not close. BUT if you are in the general public and never are exposed to world class guitarists like Laurence Juber , Tommy Emmanuel, Doug Smith and so many of the modern day masters of instrumental guitar I guess you'd be impressed and think he's got something going on... he doesn't.

I wasn't surprised to find this new at $3 on Amazon.com ....I guess for a 2 DVD set its priced right.",1315353600,,726,4.484848484848484

That having been said, I must say that this is a fine performance, captured in a way that gives the audience a feeling for just how much fun there is in being part of Esteban's band, and sharing that with others. I've been playing at playing guitar for 40 years and have only just recently gotten serious about applying my time and effort, largely due to this man's dedication, skill and  perseverance. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and actually watch it frequently to attempt to catch a glimpse of just how he does some of this. I look forward to the next live performance I can either attend, or even purchase as I did this one.",1294272000,,712,4.393939393939394
