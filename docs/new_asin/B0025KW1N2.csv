8351100,5,B0025KW1N2,"After I read this guy's book, The Science of Stripping, I decided to order his workout DVDs.  I'm so glad I did! The exercises are like nothing I've ever seen before, and they really hit my abs.  I have struggled for a long time trying to keep my abs in shape, and after two weeks of using the DVD I'm already seeing great definition.  The thing I like the most is that the videos offer three levels of increasing difficulty, so I'll be able to use this DVD for  a long time. Highly recommended!",1241481600,,495,4.23404255319149
