766421,4,6303988407,"Crazed killer invades a fashion house in this Italian chiller.  Even though some of the dubbing and motivation of the characters is weak, the overall style of the film is excellent.  There is enough suspense and jumps  without being overly gory, especially by the standards of today. There is a  good sense of brutality towards women in this one, however.  This one is  probably more for the fans of Dario Argento and the Italian genre of  slasher flicks, but based on the recent video dreck that comes your way,  this is far better.  The way the camera floats around the fashion house is  one many examples of how director Bava uses his  camera to invoke confusion  and forshadow the mayhem that is about to erupt.  There is a subplot about  drugs that goes nowhere and other red herrings, but you should enjoy this  endeavor in the horror video market.",916790400,3,854,4.6375838926174495
766493,5,6303988407,"One of the most impressively visualized movies I've ever seen. Every frame is interesting and this Blu Ray is packed with features. Almost three hours of good documentaries about Giallo films in general. There is a great commentary by Tim Lucas, who I hope made commentaries for every single Bava film.  Like all movies of this Genre it's a hybrid of Slasher and Murder Mystery archetypes. There is no real protagonist, but there are plenty of misleading suspects and victims, and the violent deaths have a fetishized quality that could easily put someone off. The gore is minimal, and I will say there there is more sympathy for the victims than one tends to find in a Friday the 13th style slasher. Someone looking for a gruesome horror film might find it excessively tame. The main reason to see this movie is the visual storytelling. The Giallo is sort of an inverted noir where suspense and corruption are set in a hyper colored beautiful environment that plays off the psychological state of the beautiful people that inhabit that world. Based on plot alone it's a well paced, inventive film, but the presentation matters. This is a well paced, entertaining film shot in a style that most would associate with the art house Italian cinema. That's the thing that appeals to me about Mario Bava's work. Combining some of the art house aesthetic with the pacing and simple ""watchability"" of a great genre film makes for some seriously entertaining viewing.",1491609600,2,1459,4.859437751004016
766494,4,6303988407,"Bava was a master of cinematography that's certain, but this plot? lol. Ok this is a pleasure to view with perfectly angled imaginative camera work and great acting for this type of murder mystery/giallo movie, but the script and plot are pretty predictable. I figured out, guessed who the culprit/s  were about half way through the film. It's a classic of the genre though with some original shots and setting for that time which still stand out. Beautiful settings, attractive women... but you're pretty much dropped into the deep end of the murder mystery and along for a reckless ride until the end. Basically if you like murder mystery movies with stylish visuals you'll love this movie, but like me might find the plot lacking... which is the fate of a lot of movies in general.

Bava was a master at shot make, design and cinematography so that's the main draw. Have unlike Argento was indeed a cinematography and Argento's weaker films were those which didn't have great cinematographers working on them, so Argento's movies were at the mercy of his cinematographers. I bought a huge batch of Bava Blu-ray movies and am slowly working my way through them, previously I was a fan of his Planet of the Vampires which I love, but I never knew he was a pioneer of the Italian Giallo genre so this is interesting material to experience. If you like the campy off the wall themes of Argento movies like Phenomenon then you might love Bava's work as well, at least I'm enjoying what I've viewed so far. I'm a fan of Argento and have all of his major works, Suspiria of course, Deep Red, Four Flies on Gray Velvet, Phenomenon etc, but as I noticed Argento wasn't self sufficient and relied on cinematographers to give his movies style and class whereas Bava could handle the cinematography on his own.",1491609600,2,1801,4.69620253164557

766496,4,6303988407,"Blood and Black Lace is a feast for the eyes with its eerie atmosphere, striking colors, and overdramatic visuals. The mists seem to glow in the dark and the dimly lit interiors seem to be illuminated as if by magic. Bava is a master of color, light, and shadow. With these entrancing effects he lures us into the gloom and bewitches us with recurring scenes of impending doom.

The strength of this film is not so much about the plot as it is about the images. The women's exotic and expressive Fellini-esque faces, especially those of the models, are some of the film's biggest attractions. He uses their beauty and vulnerability to heighten the dramatic effect as he ushers us into scenarios of dread and terror. Viewers will feel compelled to guess the identity of the masked marauder, who might remind some horrorphiles of the even more frightful Michael Myers. His occasional appearances might quicken your pulse and have you reaching out for the light switch, or, he may seem less threatening compared to other movie monsters, but there's no denying he's one violently creepy and fiendish fellow.

Curiously, the men in this film are pretty dull save one who bears an uncanny resemblance to Peter Lorre. I suppose it was Bava's intention to keep the men in the background so the spotlight would ultimately fall upon the damsels in distress, but a few more questionable characters would have left us guessing and feeding our delight for picking out suspects and for solving mysteries. It's a film that falls a bit short of being thrilling due to a patchy and less-than-credible plot with a comic-book ending, but it's definitely worth a watch...at least once.

766502,5,6303988407,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I cant say this loud enough. This is one of the most gorgeous films Ive ever seen released on blu-ray. Seriously it is a visual delight. Let me put it this way and this is no fault in the film. I had to start watching this film 4 different times. I made the mistake of doing so late at night and was so tired Id fall asleep. Again, this was no fault of the film. And each time I went back, including the final time, I always started at the beginning. Not to remind me of what happened but because I so enjoyed the look of the film. It is beautiful!

So lets get the story out of the way first shall we? The film opens with the murder of Isabell, a model who works in an haute couture fashion house on her way home on a dark and stormy night. Her body shows up the next day in a studio closet. As the police begin to investigate the number of suspects grows rather than dwindle. It seems most of the other models had some reason or another to fear Isabella. The owner, the studios manager, friends and other co-workers as well.

A diary that Isabella kept is also discovered but before it can be taken to the police it is stolen. The woman, another model, who stole the diary is tortured and also found murdered. Each time we see the murderer he/she is clothed in a black coat, black gloves and a full face mask. The identity of the murderer as well as who will survive are not revealed until the end of the film.

Yes, the story can seem fairly simple. But the twists and turns presented in the backstage issues among the cast make it as much a melodrama as a near perfect giallo film.

For those who don't know what giallo is it is a genre of Italian film named so because they presented whodunits, murder mysteries that were similar to the style of writing found in books published in that country that were published with a bold yellow border, giallo meaning yellow in Italian. Those books which featured the writings of Edgar Wallace, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and more were quite popular. The films were mostly whodunits as well but had several items that became running themes, among them a killer whose face is not seen who wore black gloves. The amount of violence was also fairly extreme for the time and was a noted feature.

So what makes this one stand out? The director of the film was Mario Bava, a noted Italian director who came from a cinematographer background. For Bava the look of the film was as important as the story being told if not more so. It shows in this film. The colors used here virtually leap from the screen. Bava used extremes in color to highlight various scenes with the murders taking place in a highly stylized use of lighting and color that Ive not seen before. It helps the story rather than hinder it. It catches your eye and makes you watch just to see the images on screen.

It was also one of the first of the giallo films, some calling it the very first made although there were a few others that qualified. While it was released in 1964 it holds up to todays standards. Younger viewers might think it is ripping off any number of slasher films theyve witnessed but the fact is it was there long before the rest. The film led the way for directors that followed, including the most famous of these other than Bava, Dario Argento. Having worked with Bava the influence he had on Argento is obvious.

Its hard to describe just how amazing this film is visually. I know, I keep raving about it but it really is that great. From the opening credits my eyes went wide watching what was on the screen. I kept asking myself how I had never seen this movie but then I thought what sort of condition would it have been in had I seen it years ago? Arrow Video has done an amazing release with this one offering it in a 2k transfer and in 1080p. Until you watch it you won't realize just how amazing the film looks because of this.

Not only have they done a great job with the presentation of the actual film the extras are so good that even I watched them. And keep in mind, Im not one to watch all of the extras on every film. But Arrow does such a great job of it that I cant help myself. Included on this one are Psycho Analysis (a new documentary on BLOOD AND BLACK LACE and the orgins of the giallo genre featuring interviews with directors Argento and Lamberto Bava, screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, critics Roberto Curti and Steve Della Casa and crime novelists Sandrone Dazieri and Carlo Lucarelli), an appreciation by Helene Cattet & Bruno Forzani, YELLO (a short film neo-giallo by Ryan Haysom & Jon Britt), GENDER AND GIALLO (a visual essay by Michael Mackenzie exploring the giallos relationship with the social upheavals of the 60s and 70s), a panel discussion featuting Argento, Lamberto Bava and Steve Della Casa recorded in 2014, The Sinister Image program featuring Cameron Mithchell one of the stars of the film, alternative opening title from the US release, the original theatrical trailer, a reversible sleeve featuring new artwork by Graham Humphreys and finally a collectors booklet that features new writing on the film by Howard Hughes; Destination Terror, an interview with Joe Dante; David Del Valle on Cameron Mitchell and more.

Arrow Video has pulled out all stops on this release and it shows. Fans of the film will go insane over the combination of extras combined with the gorgeous presentation. Horror fans may end up discovering a treat that they somehow missed like I did.  And collectors will find this a must have for their shelf, an original film that delights all of the senses. For some it might seem dated but for those willing to take the trip this is one Italian film that should be required viewing for film fans and one that I know Ill be watching more than once.",1475107200,,5814,4.4446529080675425
766567,5,6303988407,"One of Mario Bava's signature films, Blood and Black Lace set the pace for the many European murder mystery films that followed it through the 60s and 70s. A spectacularly vivid work with minimally bloody yet striking depictions of savagery, Blood and Black Lace does what a murder-themed movie should and its active camerawork, interesting characters and eye-catching use of color add polish to the show.

The Arrow blu-ray edition is said to be the best home video version available and it is indeed remarkably clear and colorful. It's easily a five-star product but, alas, falls short of being a definitive release. That's because the print used for Arrow's otherwise superb blu-ray is cropped at the left and right margins, so we're not quite seeing all of what Bava filmed when he framed his shots.

This is important to note because if any director used scene composition and framing to maximum effect, it's Bava. Though the cropping of Arrow's print can be described as slight, even slight cropping makes a noticeable difference on many of the carefully composed medium- and long-range shots in Blood and Black Lace, especially the ones that establish setting.

But for fans of the movie and those who are curious, this is a great alternative until a properly formatted edition is released.",1474761600,2,1297,4.99537037037037

766573,4,6303988407,"By and large, Blood and Black Lace is considered as one of the earliest examples of the giallo-, a genre that wouldn't come into full swing until the early 70's. In the late 70's, too, the giallo, while not at all without predecessors, would have a large impact on the American slasher-movies.
As it is though, all the key elements are quite in place in this one: a masked and fetishized killer, a bunch of attractive girls getting killed in increasingly nasty, inventive, sadistic ways, all wrapped up in a way too convoluted plot relying heavily on both coincidence and red herrings instead of narrative logic - and in the hands of director Mario Bava, this all turns out to be a very stylish, tense and above all highly enjoyable affair, a film that, while not necessarily well-written, has all the suspense and shocks in the right places, and even though it's clearly a piece of nostalgia, it still keeps one at the edge of one's seat!",1462838400,,939,4.62874251497006

766575,4,6303988407,"At the heart of this mystery is the desperation to retrieve a diary that contains far too much information.  To cover up the death of its author, a few other women had to die.  It was a smoke screen of sorts, a distraction meant to confuse and befuddle the authorities.  You cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs!

At the time this film was made, it might have seemed brutal and extreme.  By todays standards, it is quite tame.  The best thing it has going for it is the cinematography (Ubaldo Terzano), the editing (Mario Serandrei), and the art direction.  It is very stylish and stylized; a great use of color, light, and shadow.  Most of the sets are made of graphic elements that photograph well.  Each scene is exquisitely composed.  But the story is a bit routine and the actors tend to be stiff and formal, which is only worsened through the dubbing process (lips flapping with nothing coming out while a brief response is made in a voice that doesnt quite match the look of the actor speaking).  Still, even so, regardless, there is something about this film that is quite compelling.  At the time of its initial release, Blood and Black Lace was a box office failure.  It has since picked up a following of supporters.",1458432000,7,1238,4.547511312217194
766576,5,6303988407,"With the steelbook release continually delayed on amazon, I finally ordered directly from Arrow Films in the U.K. First of all, I was delighted to discover that, by ordering directly from the distributor, I was able to purchase the film for around $23 USD, as opposed to the original $49.99 (or thereabouts) advertised on amazon. The shipping cost came to an additional $3.99 (from the U.K. to the U.S.!!) so the total for my order was around $27. Also, the blu-ray disc works on both Region A and B players, which includes the U.S.

The steelbook, itself, is a sleekly perverse little work of art, as is the film inside. I've always considered Mario Bavs's ""Blood and Black Lace"" to be the high point of the giallo genre (along with ""Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" and a couple of others) and this restoration of the film is superlative. The vivid primary colors are both dazzling and lurid, accentuating the glamorous decadence of the characters and settings while driving home the horror and extreme violence of the acts committed by the masked, gloved killer. Carlo Rustichelli's jazzy and sensually menacing score, an integral part of the film, has never sounded better than on this restoration. Previous DVD incarnations of this film have also had problems with the sound, which has sometimes seemed discordant; also, in the English dubbed versions, the actor's dialogue was completely out of synch with their lip movements, which I found jarringly irritating. I haven't checked out the English language version on this steelbook, as I have been pleased with the English-subtitled, Italian language option on this new disc.

Anyone reading this review is, doubtless, familiar with the premise of ""Blood and Black Lace"" but, in a nutshell, it's an ultra-stylish, beautifully filmed predecessor of the slasher films that later dominated movie screens. A group of gorgeous models at a fashion house in Rome are stalked and viciously murdered by a mysterious, creepy looking sadist. The ineffective police inspector suggests that it is the work of a sex maniac but, considering the fact that everyone connected with the fashion house seems to have his or her own deep, dark secrets, the killer may have other motives. There's really not much more to it than that. As a murder mystery, I think the film works fairly well, although star, Cameron Mitchell, with his boxer-like demeanor and Hollywood pedigree, seems a little out of place in a fashion house (and among the international cast) and, therefore, stands out as a fairly obvious suspect, whether the suspicion is warranted or not. Not that the clueless lead detective (Thomas Reiner, in the type of role that would become a staple of most giallo films) noticed. Eva Bartok, playing the owner of the fashion house, is very good and brings a certain degree of vulnerability to an, otherwise, not-so-sympathetic character. The rest of the cast includes Dante di Paolo (once married to Rosemary Clooney), Lea Krugher, Mary Arden and Ariana Gorini.

The graphic violence (for the time period) is effectively revolting, and there are some genuine scares in the film, particularly when one of the characters finds herself in a large, empty antiques warehouse with someone lurking in the shadows.

The blu-ray disc has a number of extras, including an informative 25 page booklet, interviews with Lamberto Bava, Dario Argento, Helene Cattet and Bruno Forzani  (among others) discussing ""Blood and Black Lace"" and other films in the giallo genre, a panel discussion of the film and a short giallo called ""Yellow"", from filmmaker Ryan Haysom.

I highly recommend this steelbook to fans of Bava and the giallo genre, and of this film, in particular. And, if you enjoy thrillers yet have somehow managed never to see this gem from the sixties, it's well worth checking it out. It's a classic of the genre.",1453766400,7,3852,5.0109375

766609,3,6303988407,"Mario Bava (1914-1980) is celebrated as Italy's master of ""giallo film""--a term that derrives from the Italian term--""yellow""--for pulp fiction.  He began work as a cinematographer in the 1940s and in the 1960s became noted as the director of semi-erotic, sado-masochistic horror films that typically found sexy women writhing helplessly in the hands of a vicious tormentor.  The earlier Black Sabbath and Black Sunday were great international successes; the 1964 Blood and Black Lace, however, was not, and a lot of filmgoers seemed to feel that Bava had finally gone to far.

The script and story are somewhat incoherent and generally concern a fashion salon populated by beautiful models and their admirers.  Unfortunately, it seems that two and possibly more models are taking drugs.  When one such model is brutally strangled, another model finds her diary--and thereby touches up a series of increasingly unpleasant murders.  The body count rises so quickly that the number of suspects quickly dwindles.  Is it the drugs?  Is it the diary?  Who can the killer be?  Well, to be honest about the whole thing, if you can't spot the solution fairly early on in the film, you just aren't getting out enough.  But in truth, nobody ever went to see a Bava film for the story.  Nor, in this case, for the acting, for it is uniformly dire.  No, the point of the whole thing is the brutal set pieces in which a white-masked killer stalks and kills one woman after another.

Back in 1964 audiences cringed at the carnage, but by today's standards the gore is pretty mild.  Even so, the build up to each killing is remarkably effective, with a scene in which a woman is trapped by the killer in an antique shop particularly memorable.  Bava makes memorable use of sets, lighting, camera set ups, and jarring bursts of layered and heavily saturated color.  The visual design is spectacular.

Blood and Black Lace was a significant flop in 1964, but in later years it began to gain a cult following and a good many fans of the genre now seem to feel it is one of Bava's best films.  Me--I found it interesting to watch once, but I can't say that I can see myself watching it again.  This is very much a movie for ""giallo"" fans alone.

Slasher movies, weird Italian school thrillers (the giallos of Dario Argento being a highlight), lovely girls getting murdered in highly inventive, surreal ways by black-gloved killers. Mario Bava's great movie is very enjoyable in itself, both as a fetishistic thriller (the girls are fashion models, and Bava milks the erotic/ obsessive visual possibilities of the milieu quite effectively without resorting to T&A) and as a murder mystery (because it was ostensibly a crime thriller, there is a better-crafted detective angle to this than later, psycho-thriller giallos).

A masked killer brutally murders a young model one evening outside the palatial estate where she's appearing in a show.  The police conduct an investigation to no avail.  Backstage during the following night's show, one of the models discovers the dead woman's juicy-sounding diary.  Although everyone present clearly is upset by this and wants to see the book, the model announces she's taking it with her and will turn it over to the police the following day--but she never gets the chance.  When she goes to visit her creepy boyfriend, she is horribly murdered, setting into motion a series of deaths that climax with a fine mystery-thriller twist.

This visually gorgeous Bava film looks great on the DVD release which includes some interesting bonuses.  Tim Lucas' enlightening commentary and interviews with Cameron Mitchel and Mary Arden are among them.

If you've never seen this film before, an important note: Watch the (English subtitled) French dialogue track version first.  The American dub is disapointing, featuring poor deliveries from most of the voice-over artists (i.e., the ridiculous, swine-like squealing of ""Marco"" at the Police station).  Worse, much of the English track dialogue is oddly phrased and vastly different from the script, leaving holes in the story and unresolved plot devices.  The French track with English subtitle does not have these problems.  Watch it and everything makes sense, all loose ends tied neatly by the film's climax.

All in all, a great film.  Enjoy!",1326844800,6,1776,5.33453237410072
766682,4,6303988407,"A great looking murder mystery that clearly laid the groundwork for later directors
(DePalma in particular), and has a fun macabre sense of humor to go with some
very effective tension.

Considered a masterpiece by many, I can't quite go there, with the bad dubbing,
some over the top acting, and a few silly twists. But that's not to say I didn't really enjoy it.

Someone is killing models at a high fashion house, and there are plenty
of suspects to go around.

Bava's use of color is wonderful, if not quite up to what he did in his own

moving lights.  Yes, many of those devices are now visual clichs, but

Good story good script maybe the lighting and the pacing at times threw me off. Will watch again and see if anything changes.

766684,2,6303988407,"Mario Bava is the godfather of giallo and Italian horror with ""Blood and Black Lace"" being one of his masterpieces.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not do this great film justice.  The colors are muddled and the sound is a disgrace. Quite often the voices are not loud enough but the biggest problem is that sound and image are not in sync.  With a dubbed film you cannot expect perfection but with this DVD the voices don't even come close to the mouth movements.  It's a serious syncing problem as the sounds of doors slamming, women getting slapped, footsteps and knocking on doors do not match the images.  It's all very distracting making watching this DVD quite difficult.  I was very disappointed!",1275091200,,702,4.760330578512397
766685,5,6303988407,"If you really want to know why Mario Bava was a genius, you need to view this film.  No other director in 1963 could have made this movie.  It is a symphony of color, beauty and violence.  Bava's use of color in this film was quickly copied by younger directors, most notably Dario Argento in Suspiria and Inferno.

The violence in this movie is shocking - and not just by 1963 standards.  Filmed beautifully, of course!

Unfortunately the transfer for the two-disc version is not equal to the movie.  Most critics consider the earlier, VCI single-disc release superior in terms of color balance and image sharpness. I agree - I own both and have compared them.  The VCI release is now out of print, but still available from individual sellers on Amazon.

The two-disc release does have the advantage of an extended commentary by Tim Lucas, the editor of Video Watchdog.  Tim is a dedicated and extremely knowledgeable Bava critic, and his commentary in this version is, quite simply, wonderful.  But if image quality is your primary concern, get the earlier VCI release instead.",1242259200,7,1079,4.809782608695652

766687,5,6303988407,"The first time I saw ""Blood and Black Lace,"" I was a 20-year-old GI getting ready to be shipped out to the Vietnam War. It fascinated me so much that I sat through viewing after viewing of it (movie houses would let you do that in those days without your having to buy another ticket). But my initial viewings as a very young man were to see the displays of female flesh (very tame by today's standards) that the movie offered.

  Viewing the DVD now, from the perspective of my retirement years, I can see that there is far, far more to this trend-setting mystery than skin. Mario Bava produced a true whodunit with superb cinematography and set decoration and some fine acting. A number of things jump out at one: In a bevy of young models who are mostly blonde and fair, Claude Dantes is a statuesque, striking brunette whose watery demise hits one like a right cross; the Italian actor who plays one of the suspects is an absolute, dead ringer for Peter Lorre; and Mary Arden dies a horrible death by ""taking the heat.""

  Bava's camera (he did most of the shooting himself) tracks and swoops through the salon, the eerie museum and down moonlit brick lanes with a unique energy of its own. The colors chosen by Bava for the sets tend to the brilliant primary -- the better to match, and contrast with, the blood which often flows in a number of scenes.

  Who is the villain killing the models? Bava throws a number of red herrings across the trail before finally, deliberately, giving the game away as the climactic scene approaches.

  An excellent ""giallo"" mystery that has become a cult classic. How little of its brilliance that young GI noticed, 43 years ago!",1216166400,10,1670,4.548494983277592

766689,4,6303988407,"""Blood and Black Lace"" is a beautifully filmed gothic horror/giallo.  A black garbed killer stalks his victims through stately manors enshrouded with mist.  ""Blood and Black Lace"" definitely served as the blue print for the era of the Italian giallo.  The victims are all gorgeous models who meet gruesome deaths.  Though the film is over forty years of age, it still continues to horrify audiences.  I cringed at some of the murders.

The movie itself deserves five stars; however, I am only giving it four because of the poor English dubbing.  Watching the actors' mouths move reminded me of the old Kung Fu movies I watched when I was a child; after the actor's mouth stopped moving, then you heard what they had said.  It was almost laughable.  In one scene, the killer is holding a girl hostage; not wanting her to identify his voice, he writes in Italian:  Where is the diary.  The English translation did not appear on the screen.  I had to guess from the victim's reply what he had written.  (In the Italian language version, the English subtitles reveal what he wrote.)  While watching the Italian version, the subtitles did not appear when the victim was reading the diary in her mind.  Therefore, the viewer had no idea what she had read.  An important plot element would've been missed.

""Blood and Black Lace"" is perhaps the first giallo but not the best.  I leave that title to Dario Argento`s ""Deep Red.""  However, I strongly recommend buying this DVD to anyone who is a fan of giallo movies and Mario Bava.  It contains a tremendous amount of extras including commentary by famous film historian, Tim Lucas, who wrote a biography on the Italian director.",1203292800,,1670,4.7526132404181185
766690,1,6303988407,"Just to back up the very critical review of this dvd below, this is a major disappointment: the one star is for the quality of the dvd release, not the film, which is one of Bava's best pictures.  The image here is really substandard, way below what should be expected from any serious dvd release in this day and age.  Although it is anamorphic, it would be hard to call this in any way improved over the first VCI release; if anything, in sharpness and color, it might actually be worse.  That a dvd release this mediocre is a rerelease is a travesty; if they want to get people to upgrade and buy again, it should be for a better product.  Stay away from this one and hope for another version to come.  I had heard bad things but ordered anyway since it was relatively inexpensive, hoping that Tim Lucas's involvement would mean that this was a quality dvd; unfortunately, not the case.",1186963200,17,889,4.429447852760736
766691,4,6303988407,"Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace is a stylish thriller that features innovative use violence, against a colorful cinematic palate.  The suspense builds as a mysterious masked killer, brutally takes the lives of a number of high fashion models.  The level of tension remains high, until the killer's identity is revealed at the two-thirds mark.  The resolution to the tale, while serviceable, could have packed more punch.  Had it finished with a kick, the way most horror/suspense films typically do today, the stature of the film might be more elevated.

While not concluding as boldly as it begins, Black Lace still makes quite an impact.  The masked killer strikes silently and with sudden violence, killing in variety of ways, pausing only to write out the question, ""Where is the diary?""  As the key to this mystery, lies in the contents of a murdered model's diary.

Visually stimulating, and an important film in the genre, this is recommended viewing.  Composer Carlo Rustichelli provides a cool soundtrack for the mayhem.  Film historian Tim Lucas's rather dry commentary track, and an interview with star Cameron Mitchell both contain lots of good information.",1171929600,,1171,5.148148148148148
766780,4,6303988407,"Some women want to strangle models, but most people don't actually go that far. That's not the case in ""Blood and Black Lace,""  where models run, scream, and die in all sorts of gruesome ways. Mario Bava's classic giallo has some monotonous moments, but mostly it sticks to stylish slayings.

Just before a fashion show, the model Isabella is found dead in a wardrobe. The police investigate the fashion house's various models and managers, but can't find any solid evidence. And during the show, one of the other models finds Isabella's diary, which is loaded with scandalous information about drugs, lovers, abortions, and debts.

But then the diary is stolen, and trenchcoated killer waits until the models are alone -- and then he burns, strangles, drowns, and claws them. The police suspect the men -- designers and managers -- at the fashion house, but even detaining the suspects won't stop the gruesome murders...

At first glance, ""Blood and Black Lace"" seems like just another bloody slasher movie. Well, giallo is to slasher movies as fine cheese is to Velveeta, and ""Blood and Black Lace"" is a perfect example of a giallo, with the arty lighting, graphic violence, colourful sets, and of course those black gloved hands.

The plot is a pretty straightforward whodunnit -- it's not blatantly obvious who the killer is, but seasoned movie fans can probably guess. And while there are gruesome slayings, the killer doesn't just jump out and kill. Bava builds up the tension and fear (which the characters also demonstrate) until it's almost a relief when someone dies.

But one of the biggest necessities for a giallo is visual style. The fashion house is lushly palatial, and the murders are elaborately choreographed chases, with weird lighting and lots of luxurious surroundings. The second murder, for instant, is like hide-and-seek in an antiques store. The only problem is a misogynistic edge, such as when the women have their shirts ripped halfway off.

None of the characters really stand out much -- they're the Models, the Creepy Boyfriends, the Skeptical Police, the Weird Landlady, and a handful of others. So it's a credit to the actresses like Mary Arden and Eva Bartok that they are able to make us feel sorry for their characters.

""Blood and Black Lace"" is a beautiful, bloody guilty pleasure, and a perfect example of a giallo horror movie. Good stuff.",1157760000,7,2380,4.9623115577889445
766781,2,6303988407,"This is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes.

However that's about all the good things I can say about it.

I can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off, getting killed by a walking suit of armor, etc..

There's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary I still have no idea.  Maybe I lost something with the English dubbing.  Once I lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot.

There's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in I don't know.

The ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view.  I don't want to ruin the 'suspense' by telling what happens.

Based on reading the high praises of other reviewers I may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie.

Give me ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" or ""Brides Of Blood"" any day over this movie.

I'm writing this review to clear up some things about this new ""Unslashed"" edition.  On the positive side, this version is Anamorphic widescreen and it does present noticeably more picture information on the right and left sides of the frame (the old VCI version was leterboxed a 1.66:1, where as this one is 16 x 9). Now the bad news.  The color and contrast have been boosted/altered to the point that the image appears blurrier, grainier and more damaged than the previous version.  Also, the interior sets (especially in the fashion house) have a putrid yellow/green hue to them not present in the old version.  The soundtrack is horribly remixed, making the dialogue sound like it was recorded in a tin can and it pops quite a bit through the opening of the film.  The French and Italian audio channels are reversed.  None of these audio problems are present on the old version by the way.  To top it off, the dvd menus are gaudy and offputting, trying to make this seem like a bloody slasher pic.  In summution, the extra picture information just doesn't outweigh all of the drawbacks of this edition.  My advice is to hold on to your old release until something better comes along.  Thanks for reading.  -JWH-",1139097600,81,1378,4.621399176954733
766783,4,6303988407,"Italian Giallo's are an acquired taste. If you like one, most likely you'll like most of them if they're done correctly. Mario Bava was a pioneer when it came to Giallo's his original ideas and terrific use of light, colors and shadows would be seen for years in future Giallo's.

Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace"" is a prime example of what a Giallo should contain. Simple plot; An unknown, masked and crazed killer is running about, slashing beautiful super models. Of course with any Giallo, made in the 60's and 70's, you can expect bad acting and terrible dubbing but because of Bava's brilliance you don't care. His legendary tactics are portrayed brilliantly throughout the film. The amazing use of colors and shadows and, the key element to almost any Giallo, the black gloved hands of the killer.

Bava's influence would be seen in many more great Giallo films, including films by the phenomenal Dario Argento. Like Argento, Bava films are an acquired taste and if you're not a fan of the Giallo style films, more than likely you will not enjoy Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace"". However if you're an avid fan of the director or The Giallo films from the 60's and 70's you'll find this more than enjoyable.

766784,2,6303988407,"I just purchased the 2 disc, special edition of this movie, and here's my problem(s):

First off, I don't speak Italian, so my only options are to watch the film with the English dub, or with the Italian dub with the English subtitles, but here's the problem; the English dub is out of sync with the film, sometimes being only slightly so, but other times being very noticeable and distracting (i.e. during loud sound effects, such as a chair being knocked over, or someone knocking loudly on a door).

And so my other option is the Italian bud with the English subs, but here's the problem with this, the English subs are missing during the scene where Peggy is reading the diary (about 30+ minutes into the movie).

Now, I had noticed missing subs during the first part of the film, but these where usually during background conversations, or occasionally a line would be missing from someone's speech, but could usually be figured out, and these where only slightly annoying, but the missing subs for the diary entry is inexcusable (and is also missing from the other subs as well) as this is an important bit of info to the plot of the story.

Also, when you set up the audio option, from the main menu, there's no problem, but I found that if you use the audio button on your DVD remote, the Italian option gives you the French soundtrack and the French gives you the Italian one. It's nothing serious, but it's an annoyance all the same.

So, does anyone else notice these problems, or did I just end up with a bum disc?",1132790400,9,1526,4.5144927536231885
766785,5,6303988407,"...with this ultimate scary thriller BLOOD AND BLACK LACE. I have already preordered the new edition which is also unrated and uncut but much less expensive then the original. Mario Bava smoked us with the unbelievably stark and dark BLACK SUNDAY which featured the buxom beauty Barbara Steele in her dual roles of evil and good. Now, BLOOD AND BLACK LACE takes on a new turn.

A murderer is hunting beautiful fashion models in a house of fashion that quickly turns into a house of pure terror. The killings in this movie are so exquisitely filmed in color and delightful cinematography that they become ultimately Argento-like: horrible things happening to people in a beautiful way. The only letdown is that you never see the face of the killer for most of the film, but that's what makes it so unbearably suspenseful...who is the masked fiend behind these grotesque murders? Only you, the viewer, can guess who is committing these heinous crimes.

Mario Bava was one of the best Italian horror film directors ever, and BLOOD AND BLACK LACE was another beautiful, creepy piece of filmmaking that further proved he, liked many directors of the horror genre like Carpenter and Romero, is an essential horror director and will remain so for years to come. Thank goodness we have his films to remember his powerful legacy on the Italian horror film genre.",1129766400,3,1353,4.878260869565217
766786,4,6303988407,"Modern thrillers, supersaturated with special effects, gruesome shots and hair-raising music, sometimes seem to be a surfeit. Sometimes it's needed to watch something more simple, something calm and dear. Old giallo films work out just fine. Sometimes it looks like they don't have any excessive details, that it's just a carcass of a thriller, a good plot without any unnecessary accessories. You can't get tired of such movies. Tired of too loud music or MTV-style editing.

But this carcass is not gnawed, not bald. Although ""Blood and Black Lace"" was shot about 40 years ago when giallo genre was just developing it's done very professionally. Directing is very precise, music is scary and used very accurately, the use of light and color can't be overestimated.

If you choose ""Blood and Black Lace"" to kill time on Sunday evening you won't be disappointed for sure and get lots of enjoyment.",1126915200,3,897,5.0134228187919465

  What happened to the mentality that could both make and go see this kind of movie? After watching this one, and looking over the current cinema listings in the local paper, I nearly cried at the lack of anything like this to see.
  The rich jewel tones that flood every frame in this film are amazing. Eastmancolor must be one of the most underrated processes in film history. Notice how shocking the white undergarments of the models seem after the killer rips their bodices away.
  A great movie in which nearly the whole cast lies dead at the end. Eva Bartok is amazingly beautiful, why didn't she become more of an international star?

766788,5,6303988407,"Mario Bava, the founding father of Italian horror (see my BLACK SUNDAY/THE MASK OF SATAN review), was a real trendsetter with his innovative camera tricks (he was a cameraman as well) and cinematic mastery. Every one of his movies changed the face of horror worldwide. But BLOOD AND BLACK LACE may just well be the most influential and ground-breaking movie in his distinguished career!
A fashion house in Italy becomes a slaughterhouse when the diary of one of the models is discovered. It seems that there is some unsavory material within the diary concerning the models. Everyone is after the diary, and in fact somebody even goes as far as to bump off a few people for the diary. Who will survive?
See folks, this is where the Italian giallo, the career of Dario Argento (my favorite Italian horror director), and the slasher film began. When I saw BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, I gained a new understanding of Italian horror and how cool it is. It's all right here: wild camera moves (achieved on a red wagon!), lighting in different colors (echoing EC Comics long before George Romero gave it a shot in CREEPSHOW and even before the first TALES FROM THE CRYPT movie in 1972), gorgeous but ill-fated women, psychosexually motivated mayhem, and of course truly awesome murder sequences! Yes indeed, we can all thank Mario Bava for the state of Italian horror in its heyday and for all those slasher movies that have come out recently because Mario Bava singlehandedly shaped the state of modern, non-Gothic/supernatural horror in just 90 minutes of murder and mayhem!
VCI's DVD is a testament to this movie's significance in horror history. The audio commentary by Bava expert Tim Lucas provides a treasure trove of trivia for Bava buffs and Italian horror fans alike! Best of all, the presentation is uncut and in widescreen, complete with the original opening title sequence (which was truly awesome and evocative) and restored murder sequences which are as cringe-worthy as anything Tom Savini could come up with! We have the American title sequence (courtesy of Filmation Studios, the animators of Fat Albert and He-Man) and French title sequence, and much, much more!

To be fair, I would have to say that it is disturbing to a degree, but also a stylish shocker done by a master film maker that is highly watchable if you're not squeamish. The world of haute couture is a perfect place to present a murder thriller in that it affords the limitless opportunities of playing with color, showcasing beautiful women and providing a host of possible villains...and victims. Bava does all of this in classic continental style. The victims are beautiful fashion models, the murders are violent and ,in some cases, gory. The settings of the salon and showrooms are garish with lots of red and black. The murder set pieces are scary, bizarre and done to the hilt. The storyline has some cohesence with enough sordid details to make it juicy. VCI has done the film marvelous justice on DVD and it looks beautiful. All in all, an engrossing horror film that continues to satisfy Bava and giallo fans and a collector's treat as well. Enjoy this one.",1034294400,22,1035,4.66120218579235
766810,4,6303988407,"In my opinion, this film is the first giallo. This movie gave birth to what filmakers like Dario Argento & others have popularized in the late 60s & throughout the 70s & 80s as a specific genre of horror film. Bava used the now-familiar use of the gloved & hooded killer killing beautiful women in a variety of sadistic ways. In Argento's films like DEEP RED, TENEBRE, THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE, & his latest one SLEEPLESS (aka NON HO SONNO), one can see the homage or formula that he used to make these films successful & effective. And it can all be traced back to this 1964 film, BLOOD & BLACK LACE (aka SEI DONNE PER L'ASSASSINO).
Bava used lavish sets, deep colors, fluid camera work, & the familiar thin narrative in this movie that is copied later on by Argento, Fulci, & yes, even American directors like Brian De Palma & John Carpenter. The storytelling in this movie is rather weak as to what set off the murders of those lovely models. Instead, this film relies more on STYLE & loads of it. And the rervelation on who the killer is... well, I won't spoil it.
BLOOD & BLACK LACE is an exercise in style & taste. It's like watching a beautifully choreographed ballet of death with brutal intensity & violence.
I would also go so far as to name this film the FIRST TRUE ""BODYCOUNT"" horror film.
To modern horror film fans, BLOOD & BLACK LACE may not be your cup of tea. But watch it & relish it for it is a feast for your eyes. The mesmerizing beauty of Bava's genius is a sight to behold.",1018483200,5,1506,4.343971631205674
766811,4,6303988407,"I knew this was going to be a unique movie experience as soon as the opening credits started to roll.  Also, the soundtrack is listed as Dolby mono but the music has sort of an enveloping presence.  Nice clarity, good sound, and a soundtrack that I didn't have to push the volume up to maximum on my speakers.
In this feature, the women are not dressed as stimulating as the other Bava movies I've seen (even though the movie is about models) but they are nice-looking actresses and the lead female is a powerful, dominant woman.  She controls everybody and it's rather exciting.  I cannot reveal her fate.
What odd sets!  What strange colors!  Bava did another film featuring mannequins that I am going to research and purchase based on this film.
The film doesn't seem dated at all.  I just thoroughly enjoyed the music, lighting, and especially Eva Bartok's performance (the dominant owner of the model agency) who was in control until the very end.  They don't make many movies like this any more, and I've rarely seen any that are as engaging.

Unusually graphic for 1964, though fairly tame today I guess, this film is still suspensful, full of red herrings and difficult to watch in certain scenes. This is the film often credited with popularizing and really starting the ""giallo"" genre and it truly is a masterpiece of it's kind. Of course we have the black-gloved killer, the plot twists, the sexual heat, etc... which makes any good giallo and as wonderful as Bava is at Directing this movie, just witness the tracking shots and the close-ups, he really excels as a Cinematographer in this one! The use of color is amazing! As strange as it is to say, it is a beautiful film to look at despite the fact that it is brutal in content. The beautiful colors grab you and hold you and create a surreal, almost dream-like quality in spite of the fact that there are people being brutally murdered. It is quite obvious that, even though it was different in content, this film with it's use of colors was a clear inspiration for Dario Argento's gorgeous, color-induced, frightening, nightmare film ""Suspiria"". If your looking for a film to show you what Mario Bava is all about as a Director and Cinematographer and you want to see the ""grandfather"" of the giallo film, there is no better place to start then with ""Blood And Black Lace"".

766813,4,6303988407,"The pulpy plot of 'Blood and Black Lace' - a mysterious killer slaughters the beautiful models of a haunted-house-like fashion salon - is not the most important aspect of Mario Bava's masterpiece, although the title accurately indicates its interest in (female) death and (fetishistic) sexuality.  Indeed, Bava seems to freeze the potentialities for terror and suspense in favour of hermetic set-pieces, where the elaborate mise-en-scene, its colours, lighting effects, set-design and the composition of figures within it, the European bande dessinee chic, are all far more important than any psychological crises the characters undergo.  Indeed, the loving way Bava films the mannequins that strew the salon, the glowing red light that shines from some, or the curved wires of others, betrays more intense interest than in any of his human figures.
With one exception: the murderer, a faceless, bandaged figure in black sunglasses, dark raincoat and trilby, a Fantomas for the more lurid 1960s, poised arbiter of aestheticised transgression, a figure who shares with the director the power to be everywhere, see everything and decide the fate of the characters.  'Blood' is not a generic thriller or horror film, but the blinding epitome of pop-art Surrealism, where the guiding spirits are the likes of Man Ray, Ernst, Cocteau and Franju, where the image is composed and fragmented into static, fetishistic components, where decor and atmosphere and look are manipulated with rarefied perversity.
We may not care about individual characters, but the look of the film as a whole, its charged shards of images, its staged restructuring of generic form, its invasively creepy camera movements, with its point-of-view shots that don't belong to anyone, together unleash a full-blown expression of our most profound and inadmissable desires, impulses, dreams, fears; our most murderously (misogynistically?) violent wishes; our eroticising of death; our terror of the unknown, the random order of death and the decay of beauty, the failure of our attempts to preserve it.  Crucially, the proliferation of murders are an attempt to keep the truth hidden, just as the unconscious spills out of any attempt to repress it.
Bava is credited in films like this with inaugurating the slasher genre, but at its inception he fearsomely negates its ideological, helpless-female/predatory-male assumptions (which is why many horror fans can't deal with him), although to tell you how would spoil your enjoyment of this Jacobean nightmare.",1004400000,,2524,5.4311224489795915

It was like watching it for the first time. The reds (and if you are a BAVA fan you know about the reds) are so vidid they will make you weep. And that widescreen. WOW. Thank you to whoever was responsible. The picture is so clear and crisp, sound is great, and loaded with extras like trailers, interviews, and bios.",985478400,5,490,4.223404255319149
766815,4,6303988407,"The first body count-movie, Bava's ""B&BL"" truly ushered in a whole genre of horror film.  Many directors were admittedly influenced by Bava's work including Carpenter, Argento and even Almodovar.  Bava created a whole style on his own that no one will ever be able to completely re-create, but it's worth trying.  BLACK LACE introduced audiences to the giallo, an italian horror-mystery --- the masked and gloved killer, the various suspects, the damsels that will surely die, the violent killings, the murderer's identity revealed --- and it also introduced the ""body count"" gimmick  (check out the euro-trailers for the film on the disc as they count down the victims one by one --- ""Friday the 13th"" would rip-off this advertising campaign 15 years later!)  You can't watch BLACK LACE without laughing somewhat at some of the character's actions and lines, and dubbed voices, but the script is not the key here.  It's the style, lighting, colors, camera movements...and of course, the deliriously fun murder scenes that make this a masterpiece of horror.  The movie looks stunning, colors are vibrant --- and it's uncut featuring the one blood-moving-in-water shot from the bathtub scene which has always been edited.  The DVD includes a fun Cameron Mitchell interview, an interview with actress Mary Arden who played the model Peggy in the film, some other Bava trailers (""Erik the Conqueror""), the original American re-shot title sequence (quite good), a Tim Lucas commentary track, photo gallery and more.  It's a great disc - recommended highly.",985305600,5,1552,5.2008032128514055
766816,5,6303988407,"I'll start off with stating that in my opinion Mario Bava (the director) is a genius.  This film and his works have already influenced the likes of Scorsese and TARANTINO (my living personal Christ). 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' and just about every teenie bopper mainsteam horror film owes a huge debt to Bava. I feel I don't even need to say this movie was phenomenal. It definitely ranks with my favorite movies of all time (and I take my movies seriously). This is without a doubt a much lesser known film. Take the leap. If you are disappointed, than I can say I wouldn't know a good movie even if I was $hi**ing DVD's",985219200,3,628,4.460869565217391
766817,5,6303988407,"Here is the movie that began everything. Without italian director Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, maybe HALLOWEEN and the FRIDAY THE 13TH serie would have never been shot. This DVD is consequently a must for the horror movie fan or simply for the curious movie lover. VCI has given an excellent treatment to the copy considering the high number of night scenes in BLOOD AND BLACK LACE. The sound is also above-average and does justice to the superb musical score very 60's.
As bonus features, you will find an interview of Cameron Mitchell who starred in 6 Mario Bava movies and an interview of Mary Harden, one of the poor victims. Filmographies, trailers, dubbed versions, subtitles and a commentary complete this special edition.
Firstly, there are the incredible initial credits, with the presentation of the actors, lost amidst the dozens of mannequins of the italian mansion house. Then the models, described as drug addicts or hiding shameful secrets. One must also admire the scene of the handbag that contains the desired secret diary, left on a table in the middle of the crowd : the travellings of Mario Bava are simply genial, exploring without pity faces and gestures of the characters. The scenes of the murders are perfect, the director creating under our eyes an aesthetics that will be imitated by hundreds of directors in the seventies and the eighties.
I could speak for hours of BLOOD AND BLACK LACE but then you would say that I'm not objective so if you still don't know Mario Bava, take a look at at this movie and become another fan of this italian Maestro who deserves to stay in Movie History.
A DVD for your library.

7859883,4,6303988407,"Tightly-woven and visually impressive giallo. Has a refined and classic feel with very assured direction by Mario Bava. Definitely not the film to pick if you're looking for something to truly scare you. It has a few tense moments but overall the tone is somewhat light and the film breezes by relatively inoffensively. It remains engaging and entertaining nearly throughout though and feels well-crafted and sturdy. The visuals are definitely its biggest strength - fantastic lighting, interesting cinematography, and some downright beautiful sets and lush shot compositions. Definitely a high quality film but lacks the punch to really take it to the next level for me, on a first viewing anyway.
