It is like she is two different people on the show.  She does screw up as a police person, but she comes out on top.  Her family life another story.  She doesn't seem to be able to put her own life together away from work,  Scott on the other hand has it all together at home and work.  She is the level headed one of the two.  Between the two theys seem to get the work done, and if is enjoyable watching them.",1403395200,,582,4.088495575221239

5691622,5,B00C6BFIYE,"This is an all women series which means all the bosses happen to be female which is not realistic but that is ok. There are male team members on the detective squad but they take their direction from the women. This series is well written and gritty. The two lead detectives, Scott and Bailey, work very well together and with their female boss solving very horrific crimes while struggling through personal lives on the home front. These DVD's play very well on my region free DVD player which gives me the freedom to watch great series like this one that are not yet available in the U.S. Region 1.",1391558400,2,600,4.513761467889908

5691625,5,B00C6BFIYE,"I agree with everything they had to say, but imho they give away too much in terms of spoilers.
You don't need to know that it ends with Rachel getting killed in a shoot out.  (No, it doesn't actually, but I don't think you want to know whether it ends with a suicide or a terrorist bomb or what).
Just watch it!

If you like the first two series, you'll love this one; I think it's even better than the others.  They've really hit their stride.  It's more dramatic, both in the personal soap operas and the criminal action, but it's sometimes funny too--there is one really hilarious moment-- which also leads to more dramatic complications.

You get to see some things that, if I can put it this way, happened in Season 2 but weren't shown to us-- in other words, some big things that happened, chronologically, before the last thing you saw last year, and kind of explain a few things.
If you're wondering whether Rachel really gets married, or what ever happened to the crazy brother, that will all be revealed.
In the first two series, I had a mild complaint that there were no  DVD extras; this series has a little ""making of"" feature, but they needn't have bothered.  Anyway, it's more of the same series, I think even better.

UPDATE 11/26/14--SPOILERS FOR SEASON 4.  YES, 4!
.
.
.
So I got the Season 4 DVD from Amazon.co.uk, as soon as it came out.  It's good, I like it, I might give it 5 stars, but imho it's not as interesting as any of the previous seasons; it's a bit anticlimactic. It's clearly the last season.  I read an interview somewhere with Suranne Jones, from two or three years ago, where she was saying she wasn't sure they'd do Season Three; thank gods they did.
Season 4, well, I'm OK with it, but they could have stopped after Season 3.
This one is OK, but the drama with Rachel and her love life is necessarily toned way down; if she kept on like that, she obviously wouldn't be able to stay on the force, or at least the MIT.  Or out of a booby hatch, for that matter.
There's not much you could do that would live up to either the whole serial killer business in Season Two, or Gill's kidnapping and Helen's suicide.
At the end, everybody is taken care of or put in their place.  Rachel's mum is dead, Gill is retiring; Scott and Bailey are both sergeants, and both of them seem to have pretty good romantic and career prospects.  Nothing left to say; the whole season is, as I said before, anticlimactic.  Not bad at all, just not as exciting as the previous seasons.",1388534400,9,2500,4.369330453563715
5691626,5,B00C6BFIYE,"This is a Region 2 DVD and will only play on a Region 2 or a Region Free DVD player.  It has not been released in Region 1 (North American) format yet.

It is hard to believe that Scott and Bailey is already on its third series. When it hit our screens just two short years ago it was like a breath of fresh air. There are many police procedural programmes on TV these days that the majority of them seem to merge into one, but this programme was sufficiently different that it achieved a good following and further series were assured. Like the second series, this time around we had eight episodes to go with the six in the first series for a total of 22 so far.

Janet Scott (Lesley Sharpe) and Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) are two overworked detectives from the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police. Although they have a somewhat tempestuous relationship, they are normally best friends. However, they are quite different in character, with Janet being the older, steadier character whilst Rachel is much more volatile although her leaps of imagination are often the factor which provides the breakthrough in difficult crimes.

In the third series, Janet and Rachel start off at a low point in their personal relationship, which remains under pressure throughout. Rachel soon has doubts about her recent marriage whilst Janet has yet to fully come to terms with her own break up. Meanwhile an interesting assortment of cases come the team's way, usually involving murder most foul. However, one of the strengths of this series is that, in a departure from the norm, the personal lives of those involved often take centre stage and this is the case for a lot of the time here. It is certainly a valid comment that there are no strong men in Scott an Bailey but personally I do not think this detracts from the entertainment.

The last episode was probably the strongest of the series and involved a dramatic kidnapping. There was some excellent acting here, particularly by Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore) who continues to be an essential element and an excellent foil for the two ladies. I do not think a fourth series has yet been announced but I imagine it is very likely. I certainly hope so as this is a series which is one of the high spots of the UK TV schedule these days.",1384300800,11,2286,4.662531017369727
5691627,5,B00C6BFIYE,"Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey are detective constables in a special branch of the Manchester police. Janet is mid-late forties (over the three seasons) and Rachel is in her early thirties. Janet is grounded and Rachel is (in her private life) hyperbolic verging on crazy, particularly in the third season. Each reflects the personality of their respective mothers. While Janet has passed her sergeant's exam there are no vacant DS positions. She is a longstanding friend of their DCI--Gill Murray. (The `Gill' is pronounced Jill.) While Janet and Rachel are the principal characters in the stories, Gill is a very close second. She is crisp, disciplined and no-nonsense, with a salty tongue and a capacity to deliver staccato dialogue which is nearly Shakespearean in its wit, speed and cleverness.

The personal lives of the characters are as important as the crimes which they solve, the personal lives constituting a continuing subplot (or is it the primary plot?) In the third season there is a continuing story line that cuts across all eight episodes. It has been compared with other continuing crime dramas such as the very popular series, Broadchurch.

The stories are gory, quirky, and as violent as one might expect Manchester capable of providing, but the key elements of each story tend to be the `interview' sessions which Janet and Rachel conduct with the suspects, perps and persons of interest. These are not high-pressure interrogations, but quiet, calm, methodical `interviews' which end up being devastating in their orderliness and effectiveness.

The writing is excellent throughout, the atmospherics very good, the performances consistently superb. This is British crime drama of a very high order. It has an obvious female inflection, but the females in this unit command male respect and do things in a way that capitalizes on female strengths and results in the bringing down of bad guys in a slightly more delicate but no less definitive manner.

On a more mundane note, the episodes are approximately 45 minutes in length--perfect for quick viewing.

Highly recommended.

(The above is my review of series 1 and 2 with a look toward series 3.  There is no falling off in quality in series 3, but the personal relationships between the characters become more intense and there is an overarching plot, with most of the season's 8 episodes dealing with a single, nasty case, one in which a grotesque family is welcoming lodgers and then murdering them and burying them in the basement.  SPOILER: there may be some other bodies there and elsewhere as well.)",1379980800,7,2580,5.08274231678487

5691671,5,B00C6BFIYE,"Season 3 of Scott & Bailey represents a departure from the first two seasons mode.  In the third season there is a continuing story that cuts across (and is the major story in) the majority of the episodes.  The story concerns the Bevans, a weird couple on Peveril Street.  The husband is bedridden (it seems) and the wife is dead.  She appears to have been struck by a blunt object, whereupon she falls at the top of the stairs.  The family dog, famished after days of not being fed, goes for the wifes throat.  This results in the severing of her head, which tumbles to the bottom of the stairs.

Ech-h-h.  Not to worry.  Were not shown any of this and the retelling (as always, in Scott & Bailey) is done with a touch of black humor and (again, as always) top verbal skill.  The couple have a living daughter, played by the superb actress, Nicola Walker, who most will recognize as the farmer/daughter from Last Tango in Halifax.  Something has happened in the family cellar in that scary house on Peveril Street, something involving, to some degree at least, the weird couples daughter.

The season begins with a flash forward to Gill Murrays being abducted by the daughter, Helen Bartlett.  We then flash back for seven episodes before returning to the abduction again in episode eight.  This is an interesting approach to plot.  In the very special behind the scenes material, the author, Sally Wainwright, explains why she wanted to shake up the series a bit and have one continuing story here.  I should add that that subsidiary material also takes us through the details of constructing a single scene, from script to rehearsal, shoot, editing, dubbing, and so on.  It is fascinating to see the effort that goes into a scene which takes no more than a minute or two on screen.

All of the production values continue in season 3.  Amelia Bullmore (seamlessly) writes two of the episodes and Rachels personal life devolves into borderline madness.  This is a very powerful season, particularly with the addition of Nicola Walker to the prime storyline.  The high numbers given by Amazon reviewers are fully justified.

Sorry, but I came of age reading Aristotle's Poetics, and the flaws that I see in these characters are not tragic in the antique sense but willful in the modern sense. Far from empathizing with them too much and seeing them as ""someone like us,"" I find their personal behavior distasteful to say the least.

Props go out to both of the leading actresses (you know the show is good when you can't stand the characters, but love the acting- I mean, how could two women be so smart, yet so stupid?) and I really hope that they get more work.  I really like their commanding officer- she's a tough, highly intelligent, take-no-s--t type who always gets the job done, no matter how insane, inane or dirty it may be.

5691704,5,B00C6BFIYE,"I am long-time fan of British crime series and this one is terrific.  Unlike most police dramas, all the principal characters in Scott and Bailey are women.  They are written as complex and nuanced:  they are smart, strong, capable; they are also flawed and very human.  It is great to see women portrayed this way and makes for a very engaging presentation of the lives of police women, while never denigrating or demeaning the male characters with whom they interact.  Season Three follows one principal story line through all the episodes, which allows for a thorough exposition of the relationships between the perpetrators, the victims and the police who are tasked with resolving the case and bringing the criminals to justice.

They have partnered through thick and thin but in this season we see them bring their relationship to the breaking point. Rachel married in the previous season. She had no business doing so because her private life always descends to wreckage. This is largely because she will not deal with her turbulent growing up with her deadbeat family. Her mother, especially, is presented as the most selfish, low class, slatternly woman around and certainly no one would want to claim as a mother. We meet her in this season and trust me, you will hate her. They also have the most efficient. demanding no-nonsense woman in all of the UK as their superior officer. I've already seen season 4 of this show too and each season is well worth watching. This is a winner all the way.

5691714,5,B00C6BFIYE,"This riveting series is anything but ""chocolate box,"" rather it is set in the gritty environs of Manchester. The writers, actors, directors, and entire team have created one of the best and under-rated British suspense series out there. Lesley Sharp, magnificent in other BBC series, brings her considerable talent to playing Detective Constable Janet Scott. She is well-matched by the extremely nuanced Suranne Jones as the much less stable Detective Constable Rachel Bailey. They are members of the Metropolitan Police Major Incidents Team (MIT) , headed by another wonderfully strong actor and writer, Amelia Bullmore, as Detective Chief Inspector Gill Murray. Primary writer Sally Wainwright does a bang-up job. There is clever exploration of the tensions of maintaining professional and private relationships, and the struggle for women bosses and their subordinates to find that challenging balance of authority and respect.

In Season Three, Nicola Walker enters the framework with an incredible performance as the deeply disturbed Helen Bartlett, daughter of murder victim Eunice Bevan. This begins an epic 8 episode continuous story, almost impossible to stop watching. The gore is a bit less than previous seasons, but the tension is notched-up, as Scott and Bailey experience a massive challenge to their friendship after a reckless and disrespectful decision of Rachel's. Oh, and we get to meet her horrendous mother, which explains a lot.

The story trajectory begins with the investigation of a gruesome death of a neighbor of Janet's, Eunice Bevan, an elderly woman who lived in squalor with her bedridden husband. The MIT team discovers that aside from Helen Bartlett, there may be other siblings missing; the family history is horrible. It appear there may be more victims buried in the cellar. Things continue to be rocky for Rachel, with her brother Dom claiming that Rachel convinced him to incited murder Nick Savage. One of the very best episodes is the last, written by the brilliant Amelia Bullmore (superb in the sequel to Manchester police drama ""Life on Mars: UK,"" called ""Ashes to Ashes."" She even mentions ""Life on Mars"" to Scott and Bailey. Gill is kidnapped by a suicidal Helen Bartlett, and all hell breaks loose...",1425600000,,2247,5.273743016759776

The three main roles are played by women, another reason this series is so worthwhile.  How many American crime dramas would dare have the main protagonists played by women?

This very popular ITV drama has been renewed for a fourth series!

Lesley Sharp and Suranne Jones have returned as Rachel Bailey and Janet Scott, two detective constables with very different personalities who are part of the fictional Murder Investigation Team in Manchester. Amelia Bullmore also returned as DCI Gill Murray and, additionally, has or is writing four episodes of the new season.

8577662,5,B00C6BFIYE,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, she drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring, and it seems separation is the name of the game. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 2, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim. Scott and Bailey work as a team most of the time, but they have their differences. Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes not to be called into DCI Gill Murray'S office. Didcipline and excellent police work is the word if the day- good series.
