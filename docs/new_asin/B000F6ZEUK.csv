8118174,5,B000F6ZEUK,"This DVD is a documentary on Derek Prince and for the most part it is done well.  There is another DVD that was put out by his family that is much better in that it is Derek Prince telling his story.  He was a remarkable man, this DVD will inspire you to be who God has called you to be!  I can't say enough to the value of hearing and seeing of this life of such a Godly man.",1303776000,6,376,3.7341772151898733
8118175,5,B000F6ZEUK,Awesome DVD! This presentation that Derek is doing is very short but it hits on all the high/main points of Derek's teachings which are all scripture based and truth. It's a must see/have in your collection of great ministry teachings. I rate it AAAA++++,1298246400,4,254,4.795454545454546
