7974824,5,B00007AJDQ,I can watch John Thaw as Inspector Morse over and over again---he was a very special actor. The Oxford background is important as well.,1354233600,,135,4.666666666666667
7974825,5,B00007AJDQ,"This DVD is a gift for my husband as it is one of his favorite episodes in the series. Since it takes place involving an English brewing family; and I have family in England, the story is appealing to my husband who brews and loves a good beer. It is highly entertaining and highly recommended.",1222732800,,294,4.363636363636363
7974826,4,B00007AJDQ,"The first half of this episode is quite average, no intellectual Morse, no surprises or twists.  However our patience rewards us as the two major soprano arias from the first act of La Traviata run regularly through the last half and our interest is peeked by the appearance of model trains two or three times.  A major surprise relative to the owners of the Brewery really picks up the plot and just as we are settling in and adjusting to it, a couple of plot twists are thrown in to finish off splendidly what we believed at the start, would only be an average Morse.  Pick this up, have patience and reap your reward.",1165363200,2,620,4.421052631578948
7974827,3,B00007AJDQ,"This episode has some illogical aspects.  Once you view it ask yourself about the legal aspects of abandoned property.  If a family does not claim ownership of some property for 150 years and does not pay death duties on it as it passes between generations of the family, do they have a legal claim on the property?

This is just as preposterous as if the Oxford CID used Ouija boards for solving crimes or used beatings with rubber hoses to ""interview"" suspects.",1157673600,2,463,4.621951219512195
7974828,5,B00007AJDQ,"What struck me most about this episode was the excellent photography--and how it seemed to be underscoring the saying about magic that ""It's all done with lights and mirrors.""

There are an astonisting number of shots with reflections--off mirrors, off windows, off the tops of cars, off framed family photographs. And, the framed family photographs in the foreground of many shots provide silent commentary to the action.

This is one of the more visual of the Morse series I've seen to date, though the cinematography is always excelletn.

Reflect on the reflections, and you'll have a major clue.

7974829,5,B00007AJDQ,"As Morse has commented on several occasions, the motivation for criminal activity usually involves sex, money, or both.  In this particular mystery, the driving forces are much more pecuniary in nature rather than carnal.  This entry in the series focuses on a family owned brewery which has fallen on hard times due to family mismanagement; consequently, a large corporation has bid to take over the brewery--- but at a price which (on the surface) seems unrealistically low.  The mystery opens with the murder of the brewery manager, who was a member of the family and who was inclined to accept the takeover bid.  Morse has to consider whether his murder was related to the takeover bid (since the family is divided over the issue) or to some other matter.  No clear suspect emerges, although Morse has to consider the possibility that the dead man's brother (who frequently argued with the victim and was having an affair with his wife) might have committed the deed.  Shortly afterwards, however, the brother, himself, is found murdered at the brewery. Eventually, one more murder victim is added to the mix for a total of three different homicides.  Elements such as blackmail, financial fraud, preservation of family reputation and status, and revenge related to inheritance claims figure prominently among the factors which motivated the actions of the principal characters.  It is fascinating to observe the dynamics of the family which owns the failing brewery, as they seem to be less affected by human loss (the murder of two sons) than they are by the prospect of financial ruin.  Only at the end of the story do we learn the identity of the character who committed the final murder; moreover, I must admit I was surprised by this plot twist.  Had I been more astute and attentive, I might have reached a correct conclusion earlier.  In any event, Morse succeeds in solving crimes by attention to details (documents from the 19th century and the choice of words during a phone conversation) which might have easily been overlooked by a less imaginative detective.  The performances are generally very good, with Isabel Dean delivering an excellent portrayal of the resolute family matriarch.",1096243200,13,2204,5.024725274725275
