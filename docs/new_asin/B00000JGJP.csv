7912019,1,B00000JGJP,I wanted the DVD of the Killer Instincts PIranha episode. I instead received some crappy Killer Instincts movie from the 80s. Completely wrong product. Thanks for nothing.,1367625600,,171,5.37037037037037
7912020,5,B00000JGJP,I love looking at movie like this let me no what wondering out in the water and that mean for me to stay away.,1330560000,,110,3.625
7912021,5,B00000JGJP,"This is a very Informative Movie, but not ""scary"" at all. It does an excellent job of explaining where P{iranha got their reputation, but demonstrates they are not the ""Maneater Viscious Fish"" the reputation eludes to. Great extras on the video, too.",1310256000,,250,4.976190476190476
7912022,4,B00000JGJP,"I thought the scenes were good, i mean as always you are going to want more. But I thought this was a great product and it taught me many new things about this amazing species. I recommend it to anyone who loves nature.",1254787200,,219,4.116279069767442
7912023,5,B00000JGJP,"I have piranhas and there was not a misfit piece of info in this entire documentory. Take it from a 13 year old  piranha expert with three of his own, this is the best sorce for piranha info on all spieces.",1061251200,,206,4.024390243902439
7912024,3,B00000JGJP,"basically this movie is a one hour documentary that looks like one of those shows you would see on the discovery channel or maybe in high school biology class. its not bad, but its not great. nothing suprised me in it. its scenes of the jungle while a narrator says something every few moments or so. if you think this video is something out of a horror film where the piranhas kill everything in sight then you will be disappointed. they only eat a catfish alive, everything else is already dead. if you own piranhas,like me, and can appreciate them, then buy this video. but if your just a regular person and want to see piranhas kill things then i wouldn't. the finish it up, this slow pace film is average and i think the producers got most of the footage by recording clips off the learning channel or maybe even animal planet with the crocodile hunter.",986169600,6,858,4.471337579617835
7912025,2,B00000JGJP,This DVD doesn't have much of Piranha scenes as I expected. The scene they  keep repeating again and again looks as though it was shot in an aquarium.  but the info is rather good.,968025600,4,180,4.264705882352941
7912026,4,B00000JGJP,"This video was pritty good. It shows Piranha as they are in Brazil. I found this video worth the money. There are a few dry spots when they are talking about other animals, like birds and such. If you are interested in learning  more about Piranha, this video is for you. This video is only for the  Piranha lovers who appriciate them, and respect them.",948153600,7,353,4.415384615384616
