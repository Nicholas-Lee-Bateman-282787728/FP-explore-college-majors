You brace yourself with your hands - she wears some funky looking gloves, I kept my hands on a horizontal yoga sticky mat and my feet/towels were on hardwood floor.  The middle part of the workout you're in plank position with your feet sliding around on towels (I used dishtowels folded in half), so not just toning but you get out of breath too!  (understatement for me)  There was a time I probably would've been able to do this, but as I'm older now it gives me something to work towards, just the right difficulty because I just stayed at the slow pace when she'd pick it up to half time reps. I like how she opens up the whole body with the moves, and the warm up and cool downs are about 7 minutes long while the hard sliding leg part and then abs on a padded surface - that whole section is 19 minutes.  20 minutes of high intensity (and some of the moves I found way easier than others), but for only 20 minutes I can attempt working up to that....her power and fluidity are inspiring.  I'm a wish-I-were dancer, and this type of full body bursts of movements and weight transfers (sometimes you switch to one side, then the other) has got to tone your entire core, arms, and legs all at once and is way more fun and fluid than plain old squat thrust and plank jacks.  I get bored with same old movements especially when a workout is hard, so this will be good way to mix things up.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like how there's not a ""play all"" or ""play entire workout"" option - it stops after warm up, workout, and cool down and the music could be more varied from the other DVDs, but it's not horrible.",1488931200,,1743,4.197604790419161

8548845,3,B00AA07IPK,"Recommend for those who like to move fast.  If you are not in good shape, don't bother with this.  The instructor moves quite quickly and some of the arm movements could really cause injury.  I felt like I was always trying to keep up with the instructor.  Not big on the fact that you can't turn the music off.  If you are looking for a great workout...Tracy Anderson Precision Toning far exceeds this one.",1398556800,,407,4.445945945945946
