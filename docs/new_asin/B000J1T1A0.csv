Scott emerges as a menacing and creepy character as too does the watchman. I enjoyed the film very much especially the outr and utterly weird music background. Not the least of the films attractions was the fantastic and surrealistic artwork evident in the entire film. The young actress playing Tess had a fresh and teen aged beauty which was very affecting. Very well done! As always these Lurker Films discs are packed with great content and the 8 page booklet was very informative (includes a few words from Lovecraft on Chambers too). Recommended.",1160611200,4,706,4.9411764705882355
8148696,2,B000J1T1A0,"I was a bit disappointed in this film.  It was unusual, certainly.  I have been reading the novel The King In Yellow, and the story The Yellow
Sign adhered to it in its general framework, but in detail it was quite a bit different.  I suppose they had to pad things to make it as long as it
was.  In addition, the two short films were not very good.  The documentary on Chambers might have been good if one could understand
what the narrator was saying.  Accent was too thick.  An ""artsy-craftsy"" film which would probably appeal to English Majors, who could
discuss it endlessly in the college lounge.  I give it two stars for its strangeness.

8148697,4,B000J1T1A0,"Ahhh, the weird Tale. It isn't really horror. It isn't science fiction. It is eerie, mysterious, frightening and wonderful. The Yellow Sign and two shorts do for Chambers what NEEDS to be done with Machen and Hodgeson. Great group of films, now get on to the other neglected Edwardians.",1388448000,,286,4.857142857142857

8148699,3,B000J1T1A0,"Aaron Vanek's ""The Yellow Sign"", which also features a special on Robert W. Chamber's life as an author after the aforementioned horror classic, and a Maupassant style short film entitled ""Tupalik"", about two ill fated young men (or one?) is a gripping feature.  While far from perfect--some may see parallels between these episodic takes on a much neglected horror tale which has the potential to be a *new* mythos (down, Cthulu! you've been done to death, Yog Sogthoth and all you multisyllabic monsters) and some above average episodes of ""Night Gallery"", so what?  We need more of that--clearly--in the mythos realm.  The director does a great job casting Andrea Gall as Edith and Dale Snowberger as Audrey Scott, the creepy guy who has the book, well, more of the psychedelic palette in this film which you might accurately guess to be the King in Yellow.  I kinda wished they'd included 3 D glasses, or something, since the quality of the film is also dependent on the lighting in whatever room you're watching it in, but whatever.  The point: this breathes some cinematic life into Robert W. Chamber's work, which I personally am surprised has not already trumped the collective obsession with Lovecraft's now name brand entities.  Definitely recommended for the horror buff.",1369699200,,1282,5.023584905660377
8148700,2,B000J1T1A0,"I really enjoyed the documentary on Chambers.  A great resource on a person who we sadly know very little about, due to his knack for privacy.

Tupilak was also very good, it didn't belong on the disc certainly, but it was a nice break from the main feature...

""The Yellow Sign"" was a contrived mess, with over acting, terrible dialog for the most part (Aldones was amazing in spite all this), and frankly I think it gets high praise because it's a ""one of a kind"" deal.  Not much media associated with the King in Yellow, so fans are inclined to be lenient.

My question is, did the script writer even study the material, I mean he certainly read it, but I don't think he really had a grasp on it.",1333065600,,699,4.305343511450381
8148701,5,B000J1T1A0,"The Yellow Sign (45 minutes) - A young girl's dreams lead her to a reclusive artist, and hints of a darker, weirder underlying reality.

Tupilak (13 minutes) - An Arctic expedition goes bad, and a curse lives on.

The King in Yellow (6 minutes) = More experimental film.

Plus a batch of outtakes and a short documentary on Robert Chambers in Paris. Small budget stuff, but much in keeping with the feel of the mythos.",1271980800,3,418,4.546666666666667

5.0 out of 5 stars ASPECT RATIO AND SUBTITLE PROBLEM IS FIXED!!, October 20, 2008
By  Lesser Knowns (San Mateo, CA, USA) - See all my reviews
Microcinema International, (currently this DVD's exclusive distributor) would like everyone to know that the 2008 edition of The Weird Tale Collection, Volume 1 (release date: October 28, 2008) has been updated by Lurker Films so that the aspect ratios on both The Yellow Sign and The King in Yellow are as the filmmakers intended them to be. Also, the Portuguese subtitles are no longer a duplicate of the Spanish subtitles, and are in fact, in Portuguese. All customers ordering the 2008 edition of this DVD through Amazon will receive the corrected version of The Weird Tale Collection, Vol. 1.

Hopes this helps!

8148703,4,B000J1T1A0,"of the classic weird tale ""The King In Yellow"" which, as legend has it, directly inspired HP Lovecraft's oeuvre. I enjoyed many aspects of this adaption, and adaption it is; it takes some license with Robert W. Chambers' original, but it does have enough menace and oddity to make the experience worthwhile. Aaron Vanek's vision of the tale is Lynchian to say the least with peculiar guests populating a deserted hotel and a lot of dark imagery and long shots. Shawna Waldron as Tess is very good, though I feel slightly under-used, and Dale Snowberger as Aubrey is fascinating.
Of the additional films on the DVD the standout is Tupilak, a French shortfilm by David Leroy which is superbly shot, acted and scripted. My only complaint is it's too short!",1208217600,,753,4.8
8148704,1,B000J1T1A0,"Don't buy this DVD.  From the lurkerfilms.com website:

""Note:  The films The Yellow Sign and The King in Yellow  are not presented in their true aspect ratio.  Although the films are watchable this was not our intent and we wish to present the films in the intended aspect ratio as created by the filmmakers.  Also the Portuguese subtitle track is actually a duplication of the Spanish subtitles.  We intend to correct this in the next pressing.  Existing customers will be able to request an updated disc.  Look here for further news.""

This warning is not on the Amazon listing for this DVD, so the unsuspecting customer who buys this DVD through Amazon (such as me) will not find out about the aspect ratio problem until after they've bought and watched the DVD.  So now you know!  Lurker Films should have told Amazon about this problem, and pulled their listing until it was corrected.

I don't consider the films to be watchable in the incorrect aspect ratio.  All of the characters looked squashed and fat.  You'd expect better quality control for a DVD that costs (at the time) $18.95.  I purchased ""The Yellow Sign"" DVD back on August 1, 2007, and I've been in contact with Lurker Films several times now, and I have not been able to get a replacement DVD in the correct aspect ratio.  Now I've asked them for a refund.

Additionally, the films on ""The Yellow Sign"" DVD are marginal, low-budget, and instantly forgettable.  There are good low-budget films out there, but these ain't it.

I'm not knocking all Lurker Films product.  I have another of their DVDs, ""Out of Mind,"" which is good.  I'm just saying that ""The Yellow Sign"" really is a poor product that should be avoided.",1197936000,8,1690,4.696245733788396
8148705,5,B000J1T1A0,"I fear that this might be a poor seller for Lurker Films because it features adaptations by the relatively unknown Robert Chambers instead of the deservedly famous Lovecraft. This would be a shame, because the Yellow Sign is the best film I've seen on the three Lurker Disks that I've ordered. Very atmospheric and moody and well acted. One of the shorts Tupilak is also quite good. The short King in Yellow is not as good. Comes with commentary and extras. Recommended for fans of Lovecraftian horror.",1189382400,2,502,4.781609195402299
