2016067,4,B0001MMGUY,"Hayate the Combat Butler (better known as Hayate no Gotoku) is a very good comedy/romance anime series. The protagonist Hayate Ayasaki arrives home on christmas eve to find that his irresponsible money squandering parents have fled the country, leaving him with a debt of 156.804.000 yen ($1.7 million).What's worse: the ""very friendly people"" from the shady organization that lent his parents the money seek to force Hayate into a life of crime as a way of paying back the debt.
The only way Hayate can think of to repay the debt and avoid his ""very friendly"" pursuers is to kidnap the child of a wealthy family and hold her for ransom. This is how he meets Nagi Sanzenin, a 13 year old girl from one of Japan's richest and most eccentric families. Hayate walks up to Nagi, saying that he's determined to take her away with him, which Nagi mistakenly assumes is a confession of love. Hayate leaves Nagi standing alone by a vending machine while he makes a phone call to the Sanzenin mansion, intending to demand a ransom. However, he messes it up complety by introducing himself by his real name even before he has a chance to mention anything else.
Having given up on the kidnapping idea, he returns to find Nagi actually being kidnapped by two thugs in a car. He rushes to Nagi's rescue but is injured in the process. Nagi offers Hayate anything he wants as a reward for saving her. Losing consciousness from loss of blood, Hayate says he would like a new job. The next morning , Hayate awakes in the Sanzenin mansion, finding himself employed as the new butler. Nagi even paid off the huge debt.
Determined to pay back the kindness Nagi has shown him, Hayate accepts his role as butler and as Nagi's bodyguard, and this is the start of their adventures together.

Hayate the Combat Butler is a comedy series at hart and contains references to countless other anime series, such as Gundam, Gurren Lagann, Inu Yasha and others. The original Japanese TV broadcast bleeped out the anime being referenced for comedic effect. This DVD contains both the bleeped version and the uncensored ""unbleeped"" version that reveals all of the references. As a big fan of anime in general, I found this to be a nice touch because it allows me to see which references i originally missed during the Japanese TV broadcast.

Besides comedy, Hayate the Combat Butler also focuses strongly on romance (which becomes even more apparent in the as yet unlicensed second season) not only between Hayate and Nagi, but also many other characters introduced as the series goes on. I won't go into specifics, as that would mean too many spoilers for those new to the series.

While Hayate the Combat Butler is an extremely good comedy series, the US DVD release leaves a few things to be desired. The price in particular is a little too high for a subtitled-only series. Typical pricing for sub-only releases is $40-$50 dollars MSRP for a 13 episode set. Hayate the Combat Butler however is priced at $40 for just 7 episodes, which is rather poor value, (though the quality of the series makes up for it IMO) especially because the first season alone consists of 52 episodes.

Another disadvantage is the lack of an English dub. While not a problem for me personally, it is likely to be offputting to some. Bandai entertainment had initially wanted to dub the series, but changed it's mind after attempts to secure an American TV broadcast deal failed. It's a shame, but unfortunately not at all surprising considering the massive slump in anime DVD sales in America. Without TV exposure, Hayate no Gotoku likely would fail to sell enough copies to cover the cost of dubbing.

There are few extras on the DVD. There's the usual clean opening animation and not much else. One thing i did really like is that the ""don't sit too close to the TV!"" broadcast clips are present.

Hayate the Combat Butler is in my opinion one the better anime comedies available on R1 DVD. Because of the relatively steep price i would however recommend that you wait for a sale/discount before purchasing it.",1248998400,2,4059,4.717912552891397
2016068,5,B0001MMGUY,"I originally picked up this disk simple by its great name. I started watching with my two daughters (13 & 10) and we could not stop laughing through first episode. The self censoring such as referring to the Yazuka as ""very generous people"" and the Hayate's mother's gambling problems is ""bad investments"" just makes it funnier.

We've now made it through six of the seven episodes and are still laughing. The series is rated 13+ but we haven't found anything offensive that our 10 year old shouldn't see. There's occasional references to Nagi (the female lead character) being flat chested but that's about it.

One of my favorite characters in the series is Nagi.  Although she is a rich brat, she's likable, unlike Louise in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Familiar-of-Zero/dp/B001F2U6XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Familiar of Zero</a>"".  It was pleasantly surprising that she didn't come off as someone who just hates working class peasants.

The series seems to pull in the best of several other series. The slapstick humor reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Excel-Saga/dp/B00029NMHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Excel Saga</a>. The school relations remind me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima/dp/B001GT9DQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima!</a>&nbsp;(the original, not the fan-service reboot). All in all, it just works. I hope Bandai is committed to releasing the entire series.

The lack of a English dub is a mixed blessing. Yes, it'd be nice to be there but we're not having any problems subtitles. There's also minimal extras but I bought the disk for the series, not the extras.",1248480000,12,1741,6.233333333333333
2016069,5,B0001MMGUY,"In reply to the 1 star review with the main complaint being 'this is a ripoff because it doesn't have dubbing':
What luxurious complaining. Certainly you must not be aware of the common prices of media in Japan. Fans regularly dish out $60 a disc for only one or two episodes!
As for dubs, if I stretch my imagination I can pretend to understand why a few people prefer them (maybe) but for something like Hayate with all the obscure references and jokes it makes... I can't see the dub living up to it. Plus, if they don't bother dubbing they can get the release out faster. Trailing on the popularity of the subs in the community will result in more sales. (Although Hayate is already not so new... but maybe for future shows)

Now for my opinion...
Hayate is a great comedy. Sometimes breaking the fourth wall but I'd like to say it doesn't abuse the privilege. There are no shortage of parody references to other shows, so if you're familiar with a variety of media it's a bonus.
The series maintains a balance that would be appropriate and entertaining for children while young adults can also find it appealing.",1246838400,14,1117,4.557213930348259
2016070,1,B0001MMGUY,"Ok Hayate The Combat Butler is a High Quality Anime that is worthy of being released in a fair fashion for the fans. Bandai is trying to walk all over people with this. Calling this DVD release Part 1 with 7 episodes is insulting, and with the biggest problem being no English dub track, they have over priced and ruined a an awesome series.. People that was looking forward to Hayate the combat butler I am sorry that you and I won't get to see the Anime the way it was suppose to be seen. I watched Hayate already Subtitled only but when a Anime is released on DVD it should not be subbed only unless its a really low Quality and that is defiantly NOT the case with Hayate The Combat Butler.... Bandai should be ashamed!",1245283200,12,722,4.2773722627737225
2016071,2,B0001MMGUY,"I bought this video not knowing the exact contents beforehand. I was looking for extremely practicle self defense techniques similar to what the SEALs use. With a title like H2H I assumed it would be pure hand to hand  fighting techniques. Do not be fooled ! This video is really only for a LAW  ENFORCEMENT AUDIENCE. Perhaps if you live in a very dangerous neighborhood  you may also find this useful. As luck would have it, I have studied the  primary martial art that is featured here- Akijujitsu, so I was pretty  familar with the moves. But unless you are in situations constantly where  you have a gun pulled out or you need to subdue someone who does, you  probably will be pretty bored.",925084800,7,694,4.548387096774194
2016072,1,B0001MMGUY,"Sadly, the film's audio track as well as translation sequence are woefully mismatched to the video progression of the film. However, those technical flaws are insignificant compared to meandering monologue and purposeless themes. I cannot remember seeing a more remarkably empty film. The meager character development and vacuous context leave me with no empathy or understanding the brutality the scriptwriter pretends has been substantiated as a naturally occurring in these two. Not even the rabbit, incongruously placed in the film, holds meaning outside the trite iconic placeholder it fills. Sadly, this film would be painfully wasteful of time and attention even if the audio and video tracts were synchronized effectively.",1460851200,,730,5.6454545454545455

2016074,3,B0001MMGUY,"Interesting film in a French artsy-fartsy sort of way. Certainly not for all tastes. There was no character development per se, merely an ongoing wrestling match between two young men who equate pain with affection. No sex in the traditional sense, yet there were some moments of tenderness.

2016093,1,B0001MMGUY,"The one notable thing about this DVD is the uncut/unedited DVD version of the series.
However, Animax DUBBED the series a while back.  There is no English Dub on these DVDs
not even the ""edited version"" that's also present on the DVD which was dubbed.

Bandai didn't even need to go find actors themselves.  They just had to use a Pre-existing
audio created by Animax Asia and their job would've been done.

2016095,5,B0001MMGUY,"That title is no joke, there is a reason this series winds up on almost every top 10 funny anime list on the internet.
This show has it all: Giant fighting robots, HUGE misunderstandings(the lead female character Nagi believes the lead male Hayate was professing his love for her when in reality he was trying to kidnap her), a hilarious narrator, outrageous situations such as fighting tigers barehanded in order to keep his job, tons of references to other anime as well as pop culture, great character development, self censorship(think Jimmy Kimmel's unnecessary censorship)... the list goes on and on. This comedy has replay value and depth as well, unlike most other comedies that are kinda boring after you've seen them once, this one will still have you laughing even by the third time around.
Now for the bad part: Due to Bandai deciding to stop marketing anime in the US this series has been dropped, combined with the fact that you have to buy each disk individually, it can make for a real pain to watch all the episodes.
I hope one day that another company will pick up this series and provide us with a boxed set since this really does deserve a place on any comedy anime fan's DVD rack, but until that day comes this is the best you can get.

2016096,5,B0001MMGUY,"I have to say that the first two segments of this DVD did not appeal to me personally, but the third and final segment, ""Combat"", is absolutely amazing!  At 56 minutes, it is almost feature-length by itself.  To clarify the product description, this disc DOES include all 3 segments of ""The Irregularity of the Tearing"", even though the DVD packaging is titled ""Combat"".

Amazon's Product Description is quite accurate regarding the Combat segment.  What it fails to adequately convey, however, is the incredibly tender and intimate nature of the violence between these two young men, and the delicate fragility of their overall relationship.

2016097,5,B0001MMGUY,"Hayate no Gotoku has been my favourite series of both manga and anime for a few years now and as soon as I noticed there was a translated DVD here, I leapt at the chance to get it.

I was pleased to find it hadn't been dubbed, as after watching..well, over 70 episodes so far; I love the Japanese voice actors. The subs seem well done, and unlike the original TV broadcast there isn't any annoying censor guy.

7 episodes on one DVD? Certainly better than what I'm used to, so I'm well pleased by Bandai's efforts here and I'll gladly buy every DVD of this in the future.

For those who don't know of the series, Wikipedia can help. But to sum up Hayate, it is one heck of a comedy with tragic elements, fanservice, an excellent narrator, well defined characters, great music, and it's re-watchable over and over. ...oh, and it has a talking white tiger. Just thought I'd throw that out there!

This is what in fan circles is known as a ""glorified fansub""

I won't dispute the rights holders to legitimately make money on a product thieves are offering for free, but an english dub would have added extra value for those who actually like myself enjoy dubs.

I don't watch fansubs myself was just using that as a kind of example.

I enjoy American voice over artists just as much as i do have favorites in japan, without even understanding a lick of japanese which is strange.

I would of course give the series 4 stars i don't think it's a 5 though it is a go show.

The pricing of this release is really low for the number of episodes included and i would give the value of the product 5 stars.

the 1 star is to send a message to studio policies that are killing American Anime fandom which started with Dubs and The usually hated by the OTAKU Macek whose amalgamation of three japanese tv animes into robotech, cemented anime into the american consciousness.  Though not Macek only Sunwagon Productions brought us Space Battleship Yamato in the cut form as starblazers, also we had anime like transformers which people thought was american made when only the scripts were, as well as voltron.

At 52 episodes long, it is a major undertaking to watch the entire series though it is such a pleasant funny series that you get to the point of wanting it to go on forever. Having seen the entire series, the only content problem I found is that towards the end the studio seems to get bored with it and loose their way a bit. The middle is truly outstanding as they really hit their stride and is the best part of the series, imho. However, and here is the rub, it's US release illustrates a major reason why the anime industry finds itself in it's current quandry, namely over priced products. I would be first in line to aquire each DVD as released if pricing were in line with what it is, a light nonsensical series equivalent to Sailor Moon, but the industry continues to attempt to bring Japanese pricing (though not as extreme) to the US, and it simply will not work. No wonder the major US anime and manga distributors continue to hit the skids and many have gone out of business. It would be well priced at half to 2/3's.
