8142167,2,B000HXE5VU,"Disappointed.  The DVD is 83 minutes long with only about 15-20 minutes worth of good video and information.  The rest is filler, put together in a hodge-podge fashion.  Minimal history about the race, very little racing footage (past or present), too many people standing in front of a camera and rambling on and on.  A whole lot of talking but very little actually being said, and too many shots of irrelevant scenes.  Its obvious the producer did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to record.  I ended up ""fast forwarding"" a significant portion of the DVD.  I have seen better TT documentaries for free on YouTube.",1469577600,,622,4.651376146788991

8142172,4,B000HXE5VU,"I'm an avid motorcycle rider/restorer and have watched several TT races.  I was hoping the DVD would contain more of the historical racing at the Isle but there was actually very little coverage at that level.  Most of the coverage however was on the 2003 races (if I remember correctly) but it was well done.  I also would like to have seen more coverage on the different classes, like classes below the 600cc classs as I believe there are antique races and 125cc races and probably others. There was some sidecare coverage however. Most coverage was on the 600cc and the Senior TT (open class).

I would however purchase the DVD again as it's worth seeing and adding to one's motorcyle video collection.",1187049600,13,705,4.7073170731707314
