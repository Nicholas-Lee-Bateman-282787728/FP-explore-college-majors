2777759,5,B000NQRR8Y,"I can't get enough of his show. He's talented, endearing and always making funny one liners. If nothing else just go green with envy over his knife skills. Probably my favorite of all cooking shows.",1368489600,,198,4.685714285714286
2777760,4,B000NQRR8Y,"This is Volume Three of the DVD collection to accompany the excellent PBS series Fast Food My Way by Jacques Pepin. It includes two DVDs, each showing detailed preparation of four complete meals. Each of the eight programs starts with something really simple which can be prepared in minutes with little or no cooking. One example from this set is a quick pizza made with a middle eastern style flat bread. He does almost the same thing in another episode with slices from a baguette to make quick bruschetta.

The other courses are all within reach of intermediate cooks but sophisticated enough for entertaining. This set has a focus on seafood, with fish or shellfish recipes in seven of eight episodes. The dishes he prepares include halibut, striped bass, salmon, shrimp, and scallops. There is a recipe for fried eggs and two recipes for scrambled eggs including one with mushrooms and truffles. One recipe is for broiled lamb chops with spinach. I was surprised that there were no beef or pork courses here. The only poultry recipes were one for quail and one with chicken livers. He makes sliced fresh truffle on buttered toast. Although I enjoyed watching these shows, I don't think I'll be preparing many of these dishes.

Since this is only Volume Two, if you want the whole the series, you will need volumes one and two also. In that case, its a bit more economical to buy them as a set instead of individually.

The original series had twenty six episodes, but sadly even with all three DVD sets, you still only get twenty four. It's too bad that in order to offer three volumes with eight episodes each that they dropped two programs from the series.",1342828800,,1879,5.177631578947368
