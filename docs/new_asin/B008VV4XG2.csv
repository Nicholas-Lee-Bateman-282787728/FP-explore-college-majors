8531265,3,B008VV4XG2,The videos are of uneven quality. Probably about 30 to 45 minutes of the total time is worth watching. The price was fair for what we received.,1524873600,,143,4.333333333333333
8531266,4,B008VV4XG2,"Really good documentary about sports cars. However the DVD on the Jaguar XKE was a big dissapointment. Mostly guys talking about their individual cars (for way too long) rather than the history of of the XKE and very little archival footage. Generally not as good as the other 3 DVDs in this package. The DVDs on Porsche, Ferrari and Aston Martin are all very good.",1410825600,2,365,4.630769230769231
8531267,5,B008VV4XG2,"I bought this set for my husband who is a Aston Martin and James Bond fan.  He watched not only the Aston Martin DVD but also the other three because he found them so interesting and in his words ""perfect man cave material"". I actually found them interesting as well.

The set is a really nice heavy box that has incredible graphics outside and inside.  The packaging is unique as it holds not only the 4 DVDs but also this memorabilia set that has all of these vintage colorful ads, motoring postcards, documents from the 1920s examining vehicle ownership in the USA and road development plans in the UK
A report from 1959 into the early use of Britain's very first highway; a reproduction of the first Highway Code manual, published in 1931; and more.  This is my favorite part.  It really made this set a collector piece that will remain in our library for a long time.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET FOR ANY SPORTS CAR FAN!  ITS A BEAUTIFUL GIFT.",1352419200,4,948,4.476744186046512
