4160862,1,B003NOGNQ0,"If I could give this ZERO STARS I would. This has to be one of the most horrific paranormal shows on television today. Don't waste your time or money. See for yourself! Watch just one episode on SYFY and you'll most definitely agree. The network should have stopped with the original (which, by the way, has really gotten boring in its own right). Someone here wrote how exciting it was when at the end of the show they do their so-called 'big reveal'. What big reveal? All that's ever talked about are personal experiences and noises that were heard. Needless to say, their 'evidence' is ALWAYS crap. Find something better to do with your time!",1296777600,6,645,4.6173913043478265
4160863,5,B003NOGNQ0,"Ghost Hunters International is a great show and I am delighted that the 1st season has finally been released and I look forward to the release of Season 2. The places they visit all over the world are fascinating also provides a nice introduction to cultures, cities with centuries of history to places I never heard of. The fact that this team functions by the same principles as TAPS, their findings are valid, well documented and always informative,especially, for us who have had our own paranormal experiences.

4160864,2,B003NOGNQ0,"This is basically the same formula as it's parent show Ghost Hunters. It's almost the same every week in presentation. What used to be an exciting formula has turned into a well worn one. You can pretty much predict what they will do next. They will have a briefing, then a ride to the location in separate vehicles and talk by walkie, brief visit with the owner/ top dawg, set up, lights out, what was that did you hear that, this is creepy, I am feeling cold, flick my EMF, etc, then a boring watch them analize, then a brief presentation of what they got.

Then they will do the same thing again next week. The show, like GH, has an underlying super hero feel to it. Even down to when they interview the owners, they stand in a line, or action pose while they owner gives a speech.

Overall, I feel that history is being repeated with these paranormal shows. In the 1800's when Spiritualism was all the rage, the demand on the psychics and mediums to produce results caused alot of forgery. I feel the same thing is happening with the ghost shows now. If a show doesn't produce results, people becaome angry and disappointed. Then a show fluffs stuff up, like GHI and GH, and ex-members claim fakery, and the paranormal takes another dive, just like Spiritalism did years ago.",1284508800,11,1279,4.484978540772532

I would reccomend this DVD to anyone interested in the paranormal.",1329609600,,718,4.804878048780488
8401306,3,B003NOGNQ0,I was hoping that since Ghost Hunters season 6 was released on blu-ray that furter seasons of it along with International would be on blu.  I'm disapointed to see season two of GHI only coming out on dvd.  Makes me think GH season 6 may be the only season we get on blu-ray.  I hate it when tv shows try one or two seasons on blu-ray and then go back to just standard dvd.,1326240000,,372,4.0
8401307,5,B003NOGNQ0,This is a great addition to any Ghost Hunters collection. The International team had lots of experiences everywhere they went. It was very exciting and entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone!,1319155200,2,199,5.25
8401308,1,B003NOGNQ0,"NO Closed Captions or subtitles?  Why not?  Do the producers think that all their viewers have no hearing problems?  People with hearing problems....STAY AWAY!  If you can't hear the program, you are wasting your money!",1309219200,4,219,5.171428571428572
