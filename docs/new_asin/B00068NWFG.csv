This set will also come with an exclusive Gir action figure, which is really nice if you ask me. These figures come with both the full set and the single disk set.

2175642,5,B00068NWFG,"Don't you hate it when you buy the DVDs for a series as they come out, only to see a box set - with a nifty box, bonus DVDs, and a figurine come out months later, forcing the true fan to choose between frugality and redundancy?

Well, fear not - that's not what's happened here.

This item is just the empty box from the boxed set, with an bonus DVD and a GIR figurine. If you already have purchased Invader Zim volumes 1-3 on DVD, this is for you.

If you haven't bought the episodes yet, look for boxed set with the episiodes included.",1103673600,94,537,4.144230769230769
2175643,5,B00068NWFG,This product is of Media Blasters.  According to the known released information this will be a Invader ZiM's house design box.  This box is designed to hold 4 Invader ZiM dvd cases; the three volumes of episodes and the box will come with a Volume 4 in it which will be a extras disc containing all kinds of bonus content.,1097798400,15,322,4.35

2175645,5,B00068NWFG,"As a teenager, when I originally purchased this disc set, Invader Zim was basically the coolest thing ever. It was like JTHM, except we wouldn't get suspended if an adult heard us talking about it. This cute little house displayed nicely in my horribly 2000's bedroom decor and make me quite the popular one amongst my friends. Sometimes it was hard to pry the DVD's out of the case, and even hard to shove them back in through the suction-effect create by the small space and the plastic coated cardboard, but that was all just part of the adventure. Really, what am I supposed to say? I've had it for like ten years, moved like a thousand times, and it still hasn't fallen apart yet or gotten discolored.",1372809600,,706,4.5234375
2175646,5,B00068NWFG,The box was in outstanding shape and it arrived to our house really quick. I was worried when I first ordered it paying that much money. After receiving it and checking it out we were really happy and satisfied.  Trustworthy!!!!,1366416000,,228,4.7

2175650,5,B00068NWFG,I think the invader zim box set is not worth $250.00. So if you where going to buy it don't wast your money on it. I have a grandchild who loves the show. I wish I could buy it,1329609600,,176,3.5384615384615383
2175651,5,B00068NWFG,"First of all make sure that whoever you buy it from includes the gir figure otherwise it will be very hard to get one. As far as the quality goes it is nothing fancy just a neat cardboard box to hold your movies so take care of it, but it is the epicness that sells it. You do also get the hard to come by bonus disc with this set too. If you can find one in decent condition for under $200 with gir it is worth picking up, however they can be very pricy $350+ in new condition. All in all it is just up to you how much you want to spend and how much you like this series. I was able to find one all together in very good conditon for about $160 so shop around.",1323388800,,661,3.762589928057554

2175655,5,B00068NWFG,"I really love this boxset of Invader Zim. You get the three seasons and the Christmas movie, along with a bonus disc that gives you extras like the voice overs for the fourth season, a music player that plays the background sounds to the show, comentary with that mike guy, and I think an alternate version of the christmas movie. I was disappointed, however because it didn't come with the G.I.R. figure in the roof of the box. Overall the shipping was fast and the DVDs were intact so I can't complain for that, but WHY did they have to cancel INVADER ZIM!!! (cries patheticly) Anyway, buy this product maybe the'll realize what a mistake it was to cancel Invader Zim, and maybe, hopefully they'll restart it.",1207094400,,711,4.606299212598425

2175657,5,B00068NWFG,"I bought this product for Christmas 2007.  Unfortunately, I did not pay close enough attention as to what it was I was buying.  No ones fault but my own.  I didn't figure this out though until my second shipment because I called to get a repalcement.  With the first shipment I had thought that I had been shipped an already returned product because it(the box) was not in the original shrink-wrap packaging and the ""doll""/extras video and what I had thought to be included-the complete set of cartoons on DVD's,was not in it.  So, hence my call to customer service for an replacement.  I, of course, finally figured out once I received the new shipment that, ""IT"" was only a  house-shaped box & extras DVD.  What about the ""doll"", you say?  Well, they apparently don't include that any longer as per the sticker on the boxs packaging.  So, Yes, I was wrong in not reading the items full description, although, I still feel it is misleading.  I hope my brain lapse will help someone else.",1202515200,5,988,4.588571428571429

2175660,5,B00068NWFG,"$116 is quite a lot for a television series, and nickelodeon is loving the fact that they're ripping you off. We all love zim, but I have a better solution to the huge house set while getting all of the included items at a cheaper price.

1)get the set of discs #1-3 as a set. (complete invasion)
2)buy the house set with ONLY the bonus disc and figurine.(Invader ZIM - House Box Plus Extras Disc )

You could pay $116 for it all in one purchase,
OR you could get it for around $51 ($16 for the complete invasion and $25 for the extras house thingy)

The house might be a little smaller, but surely for the money you saved it's worth it.",1192838400,2,637,4.162601626016261

2175666,5,B00068NWFG,"What you see is what you get.  Oddly enough, I do not mean this necessarily in a bad way.  The box opens from the top and from the front.  Opening from the front, you'll find the extras disc inside.  On this disc you'll find different material not available in volumes 1 through 3 of this cartoon series.  (Interview with Kevin Manthei - Invader Zim sound design - Audio from unfinished episodes - Invader Zim sample soundtrack)  This box is definitely for completionists, it does not necessarily add or subtract from the series.  Now, opening from the top of the box, I'd imagine you'd find the ""Gir figurine"" that comes with this set.  However, and this is a huge HOWEVER, this set no longer includes said figurine.  I just received this box today, along with volumes 1 through 3 of the Invader Zim series.  (sold seperately of course)  I was set to return this box due to some damage to the rear side of it and the missing Gir figurine.  After more closely inspecting the packaging, after already contacting Amazon, I found there is a sticker on the cellophane that was once wrapped around the box.  You'll find three stickers...  one stating what is found on the extras disc, another stating it was ""created by Jhonen Vasquez,"" and lastly, another stating ""Gir toy no longer available.""  So, as I am a completionist, you'll understand my level of surprise.  And just to clear up an earlier post by other people, there is ONLY room enough inside this box for volumes 1 through 3 and the extras disc.  There is the space in the top of the box, but, it is hardly big enough to constitute a CD, only a toy.  Just keep in mind that if you're excited about the figurine, don't be.  Other than these minor details, I do highly recommend the series to anyone, especially those already familiar.  It's something quite different to own it and watch them all again and again.

Just as a final thought to anyone who might already own volumes 1 through 3 and are curious if the entire box set will fit inside this ""house box,"" they will, but only a certain way.  The box set is three DVDs inside a cardboard box...  you must first remove them from this box in order to place them inside the house box.  Not too important, but, I hope to shed light on all aspects with this moch-review.  The details of this product just need to be updated, and this was the easiest place to do so.",1181347200,6,2371,4.470862470862471
2175667,3,B00068NWFG,I decided to buy this for the special features disc to complete my collection.  The features are less than impressive but the box is cool.  The outer box that the house box comes in clearly states that there is a Gir figure in the roof as others have noted and I definitely was one of the unlucky ones to find it empty as well.,1181001600,,327,4.09375
2175668,5,B00068NWFG,"While alot of people have been complaining about not getting the Gir figure when they purchase this house box set, I just got one off of ebay (from deepdiscount*bargains) and it DID have the Gir figure in it.",1180742400,,208,4.5

2175671,4,B00068NWFG,"... you absolutely supercalifragilistically have to get this box!!! In fact, you get 2 boxes for the price of one. The actual house boxset is shipped within another Zim decorated box. It's a nice extra feature to have standing on your shelve next to the actual DVD boxset.

The house itself is gorgeously decorated with tough materials and an internal magnet that keeps the door shut. The roof folds open perfectly. Where origininally there used to be a unique G.I.R. toy is now nothing, and that's a big bummer for people who only now see the true beauty of the boxset. They do however mention perfectly that the G.I.R. toy is temporerally out of stock which keeps them within their right. Another Zim-related toy would have done the job too...

The extra DVD disc contains so many extras that you would never be able to get your hands on wether legal- or illegally. If only you wanted to discover what else goes on beneith that which is called Invader Zim, you would have to get this set.

Don't spoil your perfectly good money on the seperate DVD's if you could get ALL of them in the worlds most magnificent box at an even lower price then the others combined!!

BE A FAN, BUY THE SET!!!",1169424000,7,1191,4.525581395348837
2175672,2,B00068NWFG,"The house and the bonus extra disc is nice, but it's not worth the $25, in my opinion.  I guess I got the other edition with the episodes that costs $100 mixed up and was expecting this to have the episodes.  However, the house is cute and well I just now bought all 3 volumes of Invader Zim and it should be coming soon so I can put it in the house.  It is an early Valentine's Day present for my boyfriend (who I've got hooked on Invader Zim). TG for Nicktoons Network for still airing Invader Zim!",1168992000,5,500,4.081632653061225
2175673,5,B00068NWFG,"Invader Zim has to be the best Nick cartoon ever. Almost every 15min episode is so chock full of content that it can keep even a cynical adult amused time after time.

Zim, as the bumbling alien, has just enough advanced technology and science skills to pose a credible threat to the earth. His humongous ego, however, contiues to trip him up.  Dib, as the only human who sees Zim for what his is, (Gaz aside) is right most of the time, but his annoying ""crying wolf"" style gets him little notice.  Together, Zim and Dib bumble through various botched plans to wipe out humans and/or save the human race.

It's the background, the underlying world in which Zim and Dib struggle, that fascinates.  The people are shallow and self-absorbed to the point that they almost aren't worth wiping out. The commercial world is devious and deceptive: such as with the fundraiser with Poop Candy which is made entirely of sawdust. The technologically advanced, yet grundgy settings (the city with large open cess pool, the skool, etc.) adds a whole anarchist/emo/punk flavor that makes Zim's efforts and Dib's defenses all the more odd (and therefore funny).

There are just too many great one-liners to do them all. Many of the best ones have even been made into T-shirts. Gir, who is usually everyone's favorite, gets a steady diet of absured non-sequetors. He's okay, but my favorite, by far, is still Zim himself.

Since you get all the episodes in the DVD boxed set, you get the treat of watching several shows in a row. The flavor of the environment and characters is easier to get.  A few episodes are a little lame, but I suppose they can't all be winners. The halloween show is just too bizarre for the rest. Mortos is a 5 minute skit stretched into an episode.  The Xmas show seems weak, as if written by stand-ins.

All in all, this DVD box set is well worth the money. So much content for so little.",1168300800,3,1899,4.591715976331361
2175674,3,B00068NWFG,"let's face it, without the gir figurine this item just isn't worth it. Beware, it isn't mentioned when your are buying it that the gir figurine that is supposed to come with this is no longer available and nothing is substituted in place of it. I ended up sending it back and amazon was VERY GOOD about giving me a refund. That's why I will still be a regular customer of amazon.com",1168300800,3,382,4.319444444444445
2175675,3,B00068NWFG,"I had the other DVDs and would have gotten this box set regardless, I just thought it was bad on amazon to list that this set still comes with the GIR figure when the sticker on the box says it's sold out.

Anime Works also needs to get on the ball and replace the GIR figure with something.  Hell I'd even take a Dib.",1167436800,6,318,3.953125
2175676,5,B00068NWFG,"Invader Zim is very worth watching. Zim is an alien (Irken) who is intent upon conquering the Earth, which he believes he's been assigned to do by his home planet. Actually, the people in charge of the alien planet just sent him to Earth, which is to them a piddly nowhere little planet, to get him out of the way because he is such a screw-up.

Zim is completely unaware of the fact that everyone regards him as a screw-up, and is very fanatical about his quest to conquer Earth.

Zim has a goofy sidekick robot named Gir who was taken out of the garbage and given to him when they sent him on his ""quest"" to conquer Earth. Gir is a hilarious character, and is part of waht makes theseries so great (he reminds me very much of my cat, I think I would've named her Gir if I had seen any episodes of Zim before I got her).

There is one person in the whole universe besides Zim who actually takes his quest to conquer Earth seriously, and that is his nemesis, Dib. Dib is a human boy who is obsessed with aliens,and heis the only person who realizes Zim is an alien. He tries to tell everyone but no one believes him, so he singlehandedly tries to thwart all of Zim's plots. It always backfires on him, and Zim's plots always fail anyway.

The artist who wrote and drew the series is Jhonen Vasquez, who was known before Invader Zim, for the ""Johnny the Homicidal Maniac"" (JTHM) and ""Squee"" comic book series. Invader Zim is more than just a comedy, the artwork is great and every episode is full of Vasquez's characteristic dark, subtle mockery of all the stupid things about society.

I think Invader Zim was excellently done and deserved a longer life than the less-than-a-year it was given on Nickelodeon. I believe this was because it was being shown in the wrong venue. I just don't think that the people who turned on Nickelodeon on a Friday night were expecting or looking for anything like Vasquez's dark, intelligent humor. I think that most people who glanced at it just assumed it was more of the same-old meaningless Nick-toons, and never really ever tried to watch it(not that I mind Nick-toons, but not even ""Rocket Power"" or ""SpongeBob Squarepants"" come close). I myself might never have sat down to watch Invader Zim, except that, being familiar with JTHM and Squee, I recognized Vasquez's artwork when I happened to catch a commercial for the show.",1166659200,2,2365,4.516355140186916

2175678,4,B00068NWFG,"The bonus disc that comes with this set is mostly interesting, though if you don't have a huge amount of interest in the music side of the show you will probably run through the disc pretty quickly.  I was also hoping that there would be some kind of visuals to go along with the recordings of the unfinished episodes.. some storyboards would have been nice.  Instead, you just have to listen carefully to follow everything that's going on.  Beyond the disc, the Gir figure is adorable (you could even put a few coins in his head!) and the house is really nice.  The box it comes in is equally nice artwise.  The one thing I noticed is the box inside the house is a very tight fit for all 4 discs together.  Once they're all in you'll have a hard time getting them out.  It's really a minor complaint though.. this is a great way to complete the Zim set!",1156636800,6,854,4.3

We also did not recieve the Gir figure that is supposed to live in the top of the house.  Amazon graciously ordered us a whole new set but that one didn't have the Gir either.  Anyway, the bottom line is that my daughter adores the episodes included (she's willing do live with the occasional freezes).  She loves the house.

This price is terrible considering what you are getting. 9 full eps per disc for $18 a disc is a horrid price. 3 discs (with one extra disc) should be about $30 to $50, not $100 plus. As I stated before, the more crazed fans an animation series has, the more likely they will overcharge the hell out of it. Wait for the price to drop down, or go without instead of buying this. It's the same with double-dip movies, if you don't buy now, then you send the message you will not be suckered in. It's why Family Guy did so well on DVD, they sold it for a really, really good price. Hell, even if you don't like Family guy, I'd go for it.",1148860800,3,649,4.038759689922481

Actually, I'm giving it a bad review because it's a rip-off! First of all, the box itself is crap. Basicly cardboard, and not good cardboard, because mine broke. I woulda expected metal or at least plastic for $35 Secondly, the DVD itself provides minimal features. A couple of audio tracks of unmade episodes, the ""uncut"" version of The Most Horrible Christmas Ever, which literally adds about 3 seconds to it, and a couple of other audio tracks of music in the show. Lastly, the SIR (no it's not a GIR figurine) figure is just a piece of plastic with a top for a head. It's not bendable, it's highly breakable, and it's really not there for much of a reason. This is really stupid to buy, though if you've got the other DVDs and you're a big fan want to put them in something cool looking, go ahead and get it.

2175685,5,B00068NWFG,"Wow.  Invader Zim is awesome.  I'd heard of it, vaguely, but only watched it when my Tivo happened to record an episode at random one day.  I had it record a few more, then went and bought this ""House Box Complete Set"".

First off, Invader Zim is hilarious for all age ranges.  The animation style and overt humor will surely appeal to the younger crowd but there's plenty of jabs that adults will laugh over.  (As the hamster runs on a wheel in its cage, the teacher explains to the children that they should watch it to prepare themselves for their lives in our nightmarish corporate system, for example.)

The premise of the story is that Zim is an alien Invader, so incompetent (and so oblivious to this fact) that his leaders have packed him off to invade the most distant, uncharted planet they could find: Earth.  Normally, Invaders are sent out with fearsome robot assistants but because they didn't like him, Zim's leaders gave him an ""advanced"" model, which was actually a defective unit that has a short attention span, acts crazy virtually all the time and can generally only attack people by annoying them -- Zim most of all.  Between Zim's incompetence, his insane robot and his arch-nemesis, Dib, Zim's chances of actually conquering the earth are pretty much zero but there's also roughly zero chance that he'll ever notice this or get discouraged.  Zim is nothing if not persistant.

The voice acting and writing for this show are both absolutely great.  Zim in particular is fantastic.  He's a complete megalomaniac, yells almost all the time, for no good reason and has the best maniacal laugh ever.

Anyway, if you're not familiar with the show, catch an episode or two on TV if you can, then come buy this.

If you are familiar with the show, here's why you want this box set:

* The ""house"" is awesome.  Shaped like Zim's house from the show, the front of it swings open to reveal the DVDs inside.  The roof also opens up to reveal GIR.

* There's a bonus DVD that contains a ""demo"" soundtrack for the show, interviews and other stuff.  The reason it's a ""demo"" soundtrack is because it's built into the DVD and can only be played from there, it's not in CD format, which is too bad.  That much is sold seperately.  Interviews with the musician behind the show are on this DVD.

* The DVDs themselves contain other extras, including an interview with the voice actors and a mode I think they're calling ""Animatrix"".  I didn't know what it was until I turned it on:  in this mode, instead of seeing the regular show, you'll see the rough drawings and storyboards used to construct the show, well before being finalized into the crisp animation you usually see.  This is pretty awesome if you wanted to get a glimpse of a work in progress.

All in all, this may be the best box set I've ever bought.  It now sits proudly on top of my TV, since it's not just a box set, it's a display piece!  Sadly, it seems these shows always eventually drop off the charts and the DVD sets become unavilable so if I were you, I'd buy this.  Now, human!  Obey me, OBEY ME!!",1130371200,49,3077,4.509945750452079

Admittedly, the unedited Christmas special isn't anything to get excited over, but that's more than made up for when you consider all of the commentary tracks that you can play with the other episodes.  It gives a whole new life to eps you've seen before.  Definitely worth the money.  And the GIR figurine's definitely a nice touch.  I can't really find anything to get upset over about this collection; it's great, and definitely worth the money.",1129334400,5,491,4.729411764705882

The replica of Zim's house is cute, and the little GIR doll is even cuter.  My only complaint is minor, and that is that the top of GIR's head keeps falling off (I guess that it's to make more room for cupcakes, tuna or a beehive).  For those of you unfamiliar with the show, it's definitely NOT for youngsters, but perfect for teens, preteens, and yes, adults, too.  There's more than enough bizarre off the wall humor here to keep even me in stitches, and I'm almost 42!",1126828800,6,614,4.258620689655173

This DVD pack is just the coolest way to bundle a DVD collection together. Using Zim's house as the Box to store the DVD's in was a stroke of genius. But not just the Zim house box the outer box that the house comes in is so cool too, with pictures of all the main characters on the sides of it.

And the pice de rsistance is the little model of GIR in the Roof.

Yes, it includes a Gir Figure, but it actually looks pretty cheap, like you bought it in a Dollar store. It also comes with a bonus DVD, which contains just a few things: Xmas episode (cool, but it's the same as in Vol. 3), unfinished episode audio (funny, but it will never be the same without the images)... The box itself is made of plastified carton, don't expect a metal case like I did.

Maybe the Box set is a bit expensive, considering it's not-so-fabulous contents and the products quality. Anyways, if you're a real fan and you already have the 3 DVD's, you should get it... If you just saw the series a few times, don't waste your money.",1123632000,4,801,4.304635761589404

The only bad thing about this was the bonus cd. The only episode on the bonus disc is the Xmas episode which, unfortunately, is the same on as on disc 3.  There is an audio track for an ""unfinished"" episode, which is kinda cool.  Finally, there is commentary and music from the show.

I've been a fan for many a year. Jhonen Vasquez, creator, developer, and writer for Invader Zim was the creative genious behind comic books such as Squee! or Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

This is the Invader Zim box house with extra disc. The extra disc's features are really amusing, but they could've added in more, I think. It's not as ""jam-packed"" as disc 1, 2, or 3. The ceiling slants open up to reveal a bonus Gir toy, and the front of the house is mangetically held together, so it easily opens to reveal a perfect fit for your other Invader Zim discs.

(...)

THAT is the box, figure, bonus disc + 3 volumes of Invader Zim. For over $100.  Just go by price if you're not sure which is which.  Also, a few reviews over there are also misleading as to whether it's the full set or just the box.

Just didn't want anyone to be further confused. As for the product, come on. It's Zim's -house-.  Doesn't get much cooler than that. ^^",1117152000,8,629,4.316239316239316

The box is a work of art and is great to store the DVDs, and is worth the $20. Now what is NOT worth a grain of salt is the extras DVD. It has absolutely NOTHING of great interest on it. YES it is a collectors thing and YES you must have it to complete your collection but allow me to list what comes on this disc:

The XMASS episode (with 2 seconds or less of extra footage, the WHOLE episode AGAIN as seen on disc 3, only with 2 extra seconds, yeah stupid)

An interview with the music composer (he is so monotone and the interview is just plain)

2 unfinished episodes (audio only, close your eyes and you might have an episode in your head, this was what collectors wanted, but no animatic, no animations, just a blank screen and audio)

Sample of the Invader Zim Soundtrack

WOW now thats a collectors edition. UM NO ITS NOT. This is a piece of crap and I only wanted the house anyway... I mean Im glad I bought this thing and got the extras disc because I can say I collected Zim stuff to the best of my abilities.

This show is hilarious! The only problem was the region code 1, which couldn't play on my dvd player which is region code 4...just make sure before you buy it (if you live outside America) that you at least have a dvd burner on your computer, which allows you to play any region code, then copy it with a program that lets you change the region code so you can play it on any dvd player.",1115683200,,582,4.252252252252252

The collector's box is one of the coolest 'housing units' I've seen for a box set, pretty sturdy with a hidden magnet that shuts the front door.  The Special Features disk is nice for the audio of unfinished episodes & soundtrack music.

The 2 interviews with the soundtrack composer, while delivering some good insights are tediously long.  Like 10 seconds of nothing while he tries to access a file on his computer.  They could've condensed the 2 into 1, but that's really my only nitpick.

No need to rehash reviews of the material.  It's stellar entertainment, the most delicious eye & ear candy, and a very good value for a box set of the entire series with extras.",1114732800,7,927,4.591463414634147
2175705,5,B00068NWFG,"First off, it's a miracle that Jhonen Vasquez was even able to make a cartoon, a miracle that Nick produced it,  a miracle the design and animation and voice talent was as great as it was, a miracle that it was put to DVD and a huge miracle that we now have toys and shirts and DVD Collector's boxes.

Does anyone remember the days when we thought this would never make it to DVD? The lame 3 inch DVD's to ""test the waters?"" Anyone? I mean, my girlfriend just got a Gir shirt at Target!! Not Hot Topic!! TARGET!!

Please put this in persepective...if you don't wanna shell out the 30 bucks then don't. You have to understand how things are priced relative to the numbers produced...This ain't a Harry Potter DVD that will sell 20 million copies...the time and cost to make something is high if you're only going to sell 3500 of them...jeez people!! It's just like a collectible toy or book or comic statue. It still costs the same money to produce something that will sell a million copies or something that wll sell 1000 copies. When it's limited it costs more to cover the production cost.

I personally think it's one of the coolest things I own. Has anyone ever priced Anime boxes? Anyone? And the ""design"" is just that it's a box. And they're like 6 discs for 150 bucks.

And one last thing: this is in no way a ""rip-off"" as some have said. No, a rip-off would be if they released this box with the 4 DVD's and that's it, leaving those of us who bought each of the first 3 DVD sets out in the cold. I think it was brilliant and very acommodating that they released a ""full"" and ""empty"" box. They were very mindful of the rabid fans in doing that.

And again, if you feel that it's a rip-off then just don't buy it. How easy is that?

I can't imagine anyone other than a fanatic completist would really want an ""unedited"" version of ""The Most Horrible Xmas Ever"" (aptly described by the tagline ""The missing seconds."")

So, really, they haven't ripped anyone off by releasing the box set after they released the three volume dvds.  If anything, the people who bought the dvds before the box set came out are getting a better deal than those who bought the $90 box set especially since we can now buy the special features box set so inexpensively.
