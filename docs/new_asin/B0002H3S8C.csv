It is less kicking&punching then many TaeBo dvds-more calisthetics,which I loved!!I really worked up a sweat and found this so much fun! I also love the tae Bo boot camp dvds with the bands but the 2 bootcamp dvds without bands are awesome as well-I'm always afraid that my bands will eventually wear out,since I had 1 set snap already.",1372464000,,396,4.438356164383562
