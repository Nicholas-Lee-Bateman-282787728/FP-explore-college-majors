7811914,5,6301480988,Sarcasm and impertinence of Pippi is very entertaining and the entire cast is excellent.  I enjoyed wat hing many times over the years.,1393632000,,135,4.869565217391305
7811915,5,6301480988,My daughter loved this movie when she was little so I bought it for my three year old granddaughter. I thought she'd be too young to enjoy it but she has sat through the whole movie twice. It really is cheesy and hard to watch as a grown-up but kids love Pippi.,1390521600,,261,4.038461538461538

7811917,4,6301480988,"I almost hate to admit it, but we bought this VHS of Pippi Longstocking because it's the exact same one that Loreli, Luke, Rory and Dean sit down to watch together on an episode of the Gilmore Girls and our family is a bunch of Gilmore Girls freaks.  As for the movie itself, my grand kids enjoy it, and the rest of us as adults are amused.  It's typical quality for the vintage, and the VHS tape we bought was well worn (but cheap) and played fine.  It's difficult to actually sit thru the whole thing as an adult (not like watching a modern Disney or Pixar creation -- these are live kids with ""special effects"" of the era) but it's fun.",1266105600,,639,4.221311475409836
