307977,5,6301045734,"It is incredibly rare to find a film adapted from a play that actually works and remains faithful to spirit of the original story.  ""The Glass Menagerie"" is one of the infinitesimally few efforts that manages to do both.  Casting, direction, and acting are superb, with an especially priceless performance by John Malkovich as the poetic but stifled Tom Wingfield.  The entire film is worth watching for his ""opium den"" rant at Joanne Woodward, though the remainder is in no way lacking.  This is a much underrated, gut-wrenching, true cinematic treasure.",1031702400,21,555,5.065934065934066
307978,5,6301045734,"I recently graduated just this year, and the year before last, when I was  a junior in high school, my English 11 teacher, Mrs. Picklesimer (ha ha  laugh if you wish) showed us this video, after us reading the story in our  literature books, of course.  I loved the movie so much, I asked her to  allow me to borrow it and she did, but she had to keep reminding me to  bring it back, because I loved it so much!  So, thank you, Mrs. Picklesimer  (now Ms. White) for showing us this movie.",969321600,9,488,4.117021276595745
307979,4,6301045734,"A near-perfect film version of a downright gloomy play, ""The Glass Menagerie"" successfully captures the atmosphere of futility and hopelessness that permeated the play and made it such a success. The choice  of actors is quite good, and I am thankful that the complete plot was  preserved, rather than attempting to alter it in favor of a more active  storyline. Eccentric, yes, depressing, yes, effective - quite so.",953942400,15,417,5.102941176470588
307980,5,6301045734,"In an age of modern technology, it is still pleasant to see some aspects of technology have not completely distanted itself. The performance given by John Malkovich was amazing on all levels. He made you believe it was  Tom; instead of playing Tom; with whom is Tennessee Williams? Laura  Wingfield and Karen Allen, as mother and daughter, offer a bond that only  talented actors could pull off. The hardest part of anything is to make it  easy and simple; which throughout the film all three did. The film captures  a sense of St. Louis during the harsh and bleak times of Middle America.  After watching the film, it leaves you a bitter taste of hope.",945388800,6,653,4.6347826086956525
308090,4,6301045734,"A young loner (John Malkovich) recalls his dysfunctional home life with his faded Southern belle mother (Joanne Woodward) and his awkward and shy sister (Karen Allen). Specifically, the night he brought home a ""gentleman caller"" (James Naughton, THE PAPER CHASE) for his sister, a friend from work to dinner at the insistence of his mother. I'm not sure that Tennessee Williams' ethereal and lyrical memory piece can or will ever successfully be translated into film. Any attempt to cinematize it would most likely destroy the delicacy of the play. It's a self described memory piece, fragile and poignant. The camera's harsh glare seems to be almost invasive. The character of Amanda Wingfield, the former Southern belle who clings to her Magnolia dripped past, is a dicey character to play. In some ways, she's a beautiful monster but the actress playing her needs to balance the nagging shrew with the loving mother who wants the best for her children. It's a tightrope act alright. Woodward's performance may be erratic but she's still better than the previous screen Amandas, Gertrude Lawrence and Kate Hepburn. Amanda may be the most memorable character but the highlight of the film is the lengthy, beautifully played out scene between Laura (Allen) and her gentleman caller (Naughton). Of the actors, it's John Malkovich who nails it though. His ""selfish dreamer"" (based on Williams' himself) is underplayed to perfection and he gets every nuance out of Williams' stunning poetry. Directed by Paul Newman with a fine bluesy score by Henry Mancini.

The Dutch DVD is an adequate transfer which is full frame rather than in its original theatrical aspect ratio (1.85).",1335052800,,1674,5.131868131868132
308091,5,6301045734,"I love this film version of GM--Woodward as Amanda is brilliant!  This movie stays very close to the original play, and the scenery is perfect. I only wish they would release this on DVD--who has a VCR anymore?",1316563200,,210,4.526315789473684
308092,5,6301045734,"I also use this in the classroom at a 2-year college, and my students tend to be quite moved by it--as am I, every time I view it.

308093,5,6301045734,"I think the other reviews of this adaptation are sound and say everything I would ever want to say.  But what I want to know is why, oh why, can't someone turn this masterpiece of an adaptation into a DVD.?  There is no excuse. I've used the VHS version in the classroom for about a decade and neither I nor my students tire of it.  But, with each passing year people and schools will be dumping their VHS players, and this faithful and compelling adaptation will disappear.  I no longer have access to a tape player, and I will not settle for any other versions, which are inferior (sorry Jessica Tandy and Katherine Hephburn).  I have written the company, but received no reply.",1234051200,5,680,4.495934959349594
308094,5,6301045734,"This is the best film version of the Tennessee Williams play, and one of the best transfers to film of one of his plays - right up there with the Kazan film of ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""  I can still visualize so much of this film, it was that powerful - Joanne Woodward's ""jonquils"" speech, Malkovich's opening and closing monologues, Karen Allen's frightened, sensitive and shy portrayal, and James Naughton's kindly, clueless, then sensitive portrayal of the Gentleman Caller.

Since Paul Newman's death, can those of us out there who love this movie figure out whom to contact to petition a DVD release of this heart-rending film of Tennessee Williams' first masterpiece?",1225324800,11,676,5.026785714285714
308095,4,6301045734,"This is a somewhat sad story. A woman and her adult daughter Laura live an extremely reclusive life, and do so in a dark, cheerless flat. Perhaps the most memorable part of the story is when a gentleman caller comes. He wants to go out with Laura, to whom he says: ""Did anyone tell you that you are beautiful?"" Upon learning that she has never dated, he says: ""That's all the more reason that you should go.""",1187395200,4,408,4.311688311688312
308096,5,6301045734,"This is the best most intelligent version of St. Tennessee's GLASS MENAGERIE I've ever seen!  There is great humor and tenderness in this version, alonside the heartbreak.  The direction by Paul Newman is subtle and insightful, the artful cinematography by the great Michael Ballhaus gives every scene layers and layers of meaning, and the acting is astounding.  John Malkovich's Tom is achingly brilliant (the semi-literate lump Christian Slater playing Tom/Tennessee on Broadway was absurd) and bursting with resentment and anger and creative potential; Joanne Woodward perfectly inhabits mother Amanda's well-meaning but at times smothering narcissistic love and sing-song nagging and melancholic nostalgia; and then the revelation is Karen Allen (who knew?) whose wounded resigned Laura cannot achieve her mother's ambitions or her brother's cultural curiousity, but who compassionately loves these two human volcanos despite everything.

I love these characters---Tom, Laura, and Mother Amanda---and I want to be with them again and again, despite how heart-breaking they are.

I only wish this version of GLASS MENAGERIE, which gives oxygen to William's poetry and lets it breathe and live inside us all the more powerfully, will become available on DVD soon!",1160697600,8,1265,5.671957671957672
308097,5,6301045734,"The depth of feeling manifested in the acting on display here easily trumps both the (wildly miscast)Gertrude Lawrence and the (vastly overrated) Katherine Hepburn versions of this celebrated play.

Though everyone involved (on both sides of the camera) does a first rate job, special accolades are due to Joanne Woodward, who is perhaps the first actress to really understand Amanda, since the role's originator--Laurette Taylor.

The pathos in Miss Woodward's delineation of the character is almost unbearable on some occasions, as in the famous jonquil soliloquy, in which she conveys, with hushed voice and beatific eyes, a sentimental recollection for lost time (and lost love) that is not only wholly personally convincing, but also manages to imprint her sentiment onto the audience with all the deja vu of Proust's madeleine.

Her Amanda is never less than fully persuasive.

And Mr. Malkovitch, in his final address to the camera, (""blow out your candles Laura"") achieves effects of the same high order, with emotions so confiding, intimate, and genuine that he leaves viewers of any sensitivity as heartbroken as he is.

All told a devastating achievement not to be missed by admirers of Mr. Williams.",1147910400,9,1211,5.253886010362694
308098,4,6301045734,"This production, directed by Paul Newman, is a good one, though lacking in power. It's as if Newman had decided that this classic Tennessee Williams play, with its searing emotional conflicts that constantly ebb and flow, was too familiar now - so something else was attempted. The emotions seem filtered out, purculated down to work against something deeper in us.

In most productions of this play, when the emotions have played out before us we watch and react with the actors; here we are expected to THINK about what the actors are SUPPOSED to be emoting. We are forced to see this movie from a distance, across an intellecualized gap: it's movie making as an intellectual exercise rather than an emotional one - almost a misuse of the medium. Joanne Woodward plays the mother; Karen Allen is the shy, lame daughter; and John Malkovitch is the son. All the actors perform admirably, but the results are too restrained and safe, not bold and daring.",1134086400,,953,4.810975609756097
308099,5,6301045734,"Of the numerous interpretations of this play that I've seen on stage and screen, this is the best--a strong statement considering the many excellent actors who've been attracted to Tennessee Williams's powerful characters (e.g. Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston).  John Malkovich seems to have been born to play Tom, the artist torn between familial duties and wanderlust.  Malkovich's intense and percussive style is an ideal match for Williams's play, in which the text and its poetry dominate.  His performance in this role is the most convincing of any I've seen, and avoids the pitfall of allowing Tom to become too morose and self-absorbed.  Joanne Woodward is also perfect as Amanda, who, though deluded, narrow, and even stupid, holds her family together through her unique mixture of courage and desperation.  Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams must have intended in the characters Laura Wingfield and the gentlemen caller, and the two generate real chemistry in the pivotal scene with the glass unicorn.  This is a must-see for anyone interested in American theater.",1104451200,17,1109,5.2727272727272725

7809239,4,6301045734,"Sad movie about young girl who has been rejected and never had a boyfriend. Great acting. Joanne Woodward does a masterful job portraying pushy mother who was beautiful and very popular with boys in her youth. She harps on and on to her daughter about all her ""gentleman callers"" demonstrating her narcissism and insensitivity to daughter's feelings, (further hurting her rather than helping.)

7809240,1,6301045734,"The movie is great.  Directed by Paul Newman and starring Joanne Woodward.  It features one of the most affecting performances by Karen Allen (Raider of the Lost Ark).  I bought it mainly for Ms. Allen's portrayal of the hapless girl living under the overbearing mother played by Joanne Woodward.  I've always thought Karen Allen was an under appreciated and woefully under utilized actress.

I was REALLY disappointed by this DVD.  I had hoped to finally retire my old VHS tape and get a better copy of this sadly neglected film.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  This appears to be a badly produced copy of the VHS that came out many years ago.  The 1.33:1 image is highly pixilated,  dark, and has an irritatingly soft focus that goes well beyond any director's artistic intent to evince nostalgia.

If your old VHS tape has died, or you no longer have a player, this could be an option.  But, if you have been waiting for a great DVD to upgrade your copy of this movie - pass.

If you have a serviceable VHS copy, just keep it until this gets a proper studio release with restored image and sound.",1468972800,5,1093,4.543589743589743

the past as being not as good as the earlier version with Katherine Hepburn, but I just watched both versions and I much prefer this version because of the very strong performances of Karen Allen and most notably James Naughton, who is absolutely wonderful in his role as the very kind and sensitive ""gentlemen caller"" with a big heart.",1437004800,,481,4.950617283950617
7809243,5,6301045734,"The play was required reading for me in high school, and although I am rarely enthralled at ""required reading"" selections, I changed my tune right away when this one was up for discussion. We got to see the movie afterward, and I got to catch a live production put on locally.
Those who do not grasp well the subtle nuances of complex drama may assume that Laura is a recluse, Tom is a selfish dreamer and mother Amanda is domineering and caught up in illusion and waxing nostalgic. It's the '30s and a very different kind of culture in which women did not yet have the opportunities for autonomy and professionalism, so Amanda fears that Laura will become yet another forgotten spinster if she cannot manage to land an administrative assistant kind of job. They are both dependent on Tom's income just to survive. Tom feels burdened by it all but I think he knows the altenative is much worse. Going to the movies night after night is about his only reprieve as you can see that he longs to travel, join the service, and have more of a life than having to be responsible for his sister who cannot seem to make it on her own. Thinking that marriage could be Laura's only saving grace Amanda starts hassling Tom about setting her up with a suitable young man with good intentions. However, the gentleman caller that Tom halfheartedly invites over, is already spoken for romantically. it is apparent that Amanda fears being deserted as the father apparently left and she fears that Tom will follow suit.
I feel like I can relate to the characters very well. They understand the harshness of existing and surviving in the real world and so they need an illusory escape; for Laura it's glass figurines and old phonograph records, Tom desires adventure and something better than being a corporate drone, and Amanda longs for the days of being a much-courted Southern belle of yesteryear. Amanda projects her former popularity on her daughter as if there is no reason she cannot be sought after and a social butterfly. Tom tries to be the voice of reason to Amanda about Laura's very real shortcomings; albeit hardheartedly. The gentleman caller, James, can only try to pump her up with self-confidence, but then he lets her down because he is promised to another.
Joanne Woodward really nailed it in this one. I did get a chance to see the older Katherine Hepburn version but Woodward really hits the ball out of the park as the domineering (but well-intentioned) mother. Class-A drama here with the fever-pitch argument between Amanda and Tom, and at the very end in the grip of despair because Amanda had such high hopes for James as a potential husband for Laura and they got dashed and now Tom is just going to go on with his life like nothing happened but as you can see by the speech he delivers, you get the idea that he does care somewhat and is not so much callous as he is feeling caught up in a hopeless situation and at a loss for what else to do. Very sad and moving.
My only question is why is this not on DVD yet? I used to have a DVR with a VHS deck and so I really want to upgrade.",1415836800,,3093,4.505338078291815
7809244,5,6301045734,"Out of all three film versions of this play, I would have to say this version is the best of them. Unlike the 1950's version, we the viewers never really leave the apartment building. We never get to see Laura failing in typing class, or her father riding out on a ship somewhere or her mother in her glory days in a grand ballroom. No, despite this fact the movie still manages to hold our attention for over 2 hours, all events being set in one space and time. John Malkovich gives one of his finest performances. Throughout the film you can literally feel his angst. Joanna Woodward is almost over the top as the ever intrusive and overbearing mother (or should I say martyr?) I think this is due to that nagging tone of voice she musters up for her part. Her portrayal of this character is very different than Katherine Hepburn's fine performance in the 1973 version. Karen Allen plays her part equally as well as the timid and shy Laura. She really is a fine and underated actress. I have viewed this movie at least 10 times in the last ten years and it always seems fresh to me. You can attribute some of the reasons for this to the movies fine director, Paul Newman as well as a wonderful cast ensemble.",1387756800,,1210,4.3822222222222225
7809245,4,6301045734,"This is a superb film, and I am glad that it's available on PAl DVD.
