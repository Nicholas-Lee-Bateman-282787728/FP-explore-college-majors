The story is that these sisters live in a magical house that ports through time jumping 5 years into the future each time. In doing so, the sisters make friends and meet folks along the way. It is this theme of meeting people, making friends and then having to leave them that provides some of the more poignant moments in the series.
These "" travelers "" are guided by a man named Kieth, who's motives are unclear but he has a rather jaded opinion and tries to force this upon the sisters.
This is definitely rated R. There is a lot of nudity and some suggestive themes. However, the story and humor are good and the drama is excellent.
Once you start watching this you really can't stop. You just have to see what the girls are going to face next.
I am surprised they didn't make a season two of Popotan. This is one of the little gems that many folks don't know about. The PC/PS2 game has notoriety because of negative themes. The anime is a fanserve in ways but is not quite the same as the game. I believe all who watch it will enjoy it.",1247616000,,1316,4.9058295964125564
8198291,5,B000R17RRQ,"This brilliant little short series manages to be amazingly cute and brutalizing all at once. The story line is far more upsetting and emotional than i had expected before i bought it, so this isn't just some lame fan service animation, though there is plenty of that.
Get it for the story line, and most of all, get it for Mii-tan!
The Japanese voice acting is superb and the soundtrack is really perfect too.",1197072000,5,409,4.54054054054054
