Unforgettable performances and a realistic story line make this a definate keeper.",1245801600,,140,4.875
1053043,4,6305613516,"I enjoyed two of the three movies in the ""Sarah, Plain & Tall"" trilogy. This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the ""good ones."" It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance.

Of the three, that initial ""Sarah,"" was the best-filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story in the trilogy. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending, all of which makes it highly recommended.

The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting, though, to see how the kids had grown since that first movie in this trilogy.",1240358400,,740,4.818897637795276
1053044,3,6305613516,"The movie opens in March of 1918.  The long, bitter winter has yet to come to an end. There is an epidemic of influenza in town and the war has taken Anna's boyfriend overseas.  Much as Jacob and Sarah did, Anna waits for every letter from him while tending the sick in town.  Back home on the farm, an unexpected visitor will soon rock Sarah's family to its core.
Although 'Winter's End' sounds exciting, its frightfully  dull and unprofessional.  The acting is just not up to par with the first two.  Glen Close, Christopher Walken and the entire cast shine in `Sarah Plain & Tall' and `Skylark.'  After seeing those, I suppose I was spoiled.  I expected that high quality when I bought `Winter's End' and thus, I was shocked and dismayed by this poorly acted out movie.  I've seen these actors/actresses at their best and they are very talented.  Now,  I am left baffled as to what happened here.  Did they just not care this time around?  Was it the director?  A low budget?  What?  So many questions, so little answers.  What really got me was when, `Sarah' (Glen Close) was caught out in a blizzard and almost froze to death.  The depth of emotion put into that scene wouldn't fill a tea spoon.  `Jacob' (Christopher Walken) put the most into it, but his acting was stilted, unreal and unnatural.  Yet, the all time award for stiffness and unnatural acting would be a tie between, Jack Palance (Jacob's wayward father)  and Christopher Bell (Caleb)  They did a terrible job.  To make matters worse, it looks as if the `honeymoon' is over for Sarah and Jacob in `winter's End.'  There is no more of that `spark' we enjoyed in, `Sarah Plain & Tall' and `Skylark.'  There might be one or two scenes where they shine as they once did, but for the most part, the chemistry is dead.
The biggest highlight of the film was Sarah and Jacob's little girl `Cassie,' played by Emily Osment.  She seemed to be the only one who took her role seriously.  She was a natural, and very 'real' in her part.  She did a great job.  But sadly the rest of the cast  lost the magic that was, `Sarah Plain & Tall.'",1033430400,9,2095,4.465608465608466
1053045,2,6305613516,"Very dissapointed in the quality of this VHS tape. This third installment does not measure up to the first two. Production values very poor. It looks as if the copy I received was made from a copy, picture was not clear and sound was terrible. I am sending this tape back.",1029456000,3,272,4.352941176470588
1053046,4,6305613516,"After watching the first two movies in this trilogy, you will find the third story to be a satisfying conclusion. In the first movie, Sarah and Jacob write letters, fall in love and then marry. The story deals with the loss of Jacob's wife and how Sarah is taking her place and finding her way into the hearts of his children. Skylark is the second movie in the series and deals with a family staying together despite the difficulties of farm life. They are committed to making their way on the dusty Kansas prairie.

In Winter's End, the issues drift to the past and how they affect the future. Jacob's children have grown considerably and his daughter Anna (Lexi Randall) is in love with a boy who has gone off to war and she spends her time waiting for him to return home while nursing the ill in town. Caleb (Christopher Bell) is now old enough to take on more farm responsibilities. Jacob and Sarah's daughter is quite impetuous and will make you laugh as she will remind you of how Sarah was in the first movie! In dealing with life on the farm, Jacob has an accident and Sarah spends a night out in the snow.

While all these issues are presenting themselves, Sarah has a calm understanding and supports Jacob while he is dealing with the challenge of forgiving his father. Their love is more mature and while the heady days of the first movie seem to have faded, they are deeply commited to one another and their children. They open their home to a stranger who they later find out is Jacob's father.

Jack Palance takes center stage as Jacob's father who returns to the Witting family farm which is the only place he ever felt was home. The issues are presented in a loving way which will make you value family more and see the hurt a person can do by making the wrong choices. They can change, but they hurt the people they care most about.

If you enjoyed the first two stories, I think I can safely say you will enjoy this third heartwarming tale of triumph over life's challenges. If you haven't seen the first two movies, I would recommend purchasing the trilogy. These are movies you will want to share with friends and family and watch again when you want to escape to a Kansas prairie for a few hours.

1053047,5,6305613516,"Loved this movie!  Seeing the previous two videos of this series is not necessary - I hadn't.  However, I bet you'll find yourself looking for (or buying)the first two videos after you view this one!  I was initially drawn  to this video because of the Christopher Walken-Glenn Close pairing.  The  charactors Walken and Close play are very good and the two actors work well  together.  Glen Close, as usual, is great!  And Walken, to my surprise, is  totally likeable and loveable(vs the ""scarry"" actor I've come to  know in so many of his movies!). The charactor development, as well as the  wonderful acting, made this a movie that I found myself genuinly caring  about the charactors.  It certainly kept my interest. It's a great  ""feel-good, cozy"" movie.  It certainly took me away into a  fantasyland to the early 1900's in the midwest.  As soon as I returned this  video to the video store, I immediately rented the two previous movies (and  am now buying all 3).  It is a wonderful series which I am sad to see end.  I highly recommend this as a warm, enjoyable movie that families would  love; as well as those who simply enjoy sitting by the fire, wrapped up in  a blanket for the evening to watch a good movie!",947203200,9,1221,4.572093023255814
1053048,5,6305613516,"i liked this...but it was suprisingly different than the others.  The overall tone to it seemed a little dreary, but it was still very touching.  The little girl who played Cassie was adorable.  It was a shock to see Lexi  Randall and Christopher Bell so grown up though.  I remember them as  children in the two previous movies and here they are almost adults in  winters end.  But nevertheless this is still a charming movie with  outstanding performances by glenn close and christopher walken.",944265600,7,496,4.809523809523809

1053129,4,6305613516,I liked this better than Skylark.  I don't particularly care for Jack Palance as I get tired of all that heavy breathing but he fit this part very well and did a good job.  I thought it made a nice ending to the trilogy.  Of course the first one will always be everyone's favorite.,1414108800,,281,4.166666666666667

The series works well and tells a fine story, moving outside of comfort zone, forgiveness and healing, trying to complete the set, sometimes still love to view as VHS, arrived in good condition, timely and prompt.",1402099200,,273,5.066666666666666

1053135,5,6305613516,"This movie begins with Sarah Wheaton answering an advertisement from a widower with two young children.  He lives across the country from her (she lives in  Maine along the coast)  and has lost his wife in childbirth two years prior to the ad.  Anxiously, although a very strong woman, she takes the train out west to see if she can be of help raising the two young children.  Their father, Jacob, keeps his distance as he is not used to a woman who voices her views.

Without giving away many wonderful parts of this movie played by Glenn Close and Christopher Walken your family is sure to enjoy it no matter what the age!!!",1360368000,,626,4.447368421052632

1053202,5,6305613516,"What impresses me the most about the Sarah, Plain and Tall movies is the utter believability of them.  I have never, ever seen movies which feel so totally authentic, like actual people's lives, as this trilogy.  The camerawork/cinematography and music are appropriately restrained, but are very expressive at the same time.  The acting feels so natural to me as a viewer, too.  To me, the films are as much genius as endearing.",1307664000,,428,4.902777777777778

1053207,5,6305613516,My wife and I have loved this whole series from Sarah Plain and Tall through Sklark and Winters End.  A very heartwarmin series.

Wish they would put out a fourth Video as a follow up to see how the family fard later.,1284163200,,344,4.029411764705882
1053208,3,6305613516,"Not as fond of this installment as the first two parts of Sarah.  Again, the same actors, children have grown quite a bit. This part of the story is more about father & son coming to terms, not so much about the farm. Not bad, a little slow.",1268265600,,241,4.020833333333333
1053209,5,6305613516,Excellent acting - A very different role for Christpher Walken. Heartfelt bittersweet story of 2 strangers from opposite worlds who struggle to become one family and create a better life in the early 1900s.
