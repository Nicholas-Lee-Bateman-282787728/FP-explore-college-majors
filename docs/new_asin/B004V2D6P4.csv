8442549,5,B004V2D6P4,"Now this is what you call HORROR!!!

Vikram Bhatt has really done an awesome job on this one...I promise you that it is absolutely scary! The beginning had me biting my nails!!!

Sanjana is a wreck because her husband, Aditya worries more about his job than her. She meets with an accident and she tells Aditya that she wants to go to Ooty, for a holiday together, to rekindle their love.

In Ooty, she is haunted by *something* but no one else believes her other than Prof. Agni Swaroop. She struggles with coming to terms of being haunted. She soon learns *why* she is being haunted and she is livid on her findings.

I am not giving to much away because you just have to watch this and see for yourself.

The soundtrack is my favourite & I even listen to it ALL THE TIME!

8442552,5,B004V2D6P4,"This movie is destined for great things!!! Not at all predictable, this thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing the entire time.

In a nutshell the movie is about a young couple thats marriage is on the rocks, and after a car accident in which the wife, Sanjana, is involved, her husband, Aditya, convinces her to give their marriage a last chance. They go to a mountain retreat to sort out their lives and suddenly strange things start to happen...But does Sanjana know her husband as well as she thinks she does???

Excellent performances by both the male and female leads(not to mention that the male is quite a looker!) The supporting actors were pretty decent too. This is a movie thats worth spending your money to watch, so hurry and catch it, you won't be disappointed!",1304467200,,794,4.624113475177305
8442553,4,B004V2D6P4,"This is the movie that started my Indian film addiction. When i bought this at a local store i had no idea what it was about but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies i had ever seen! The musical numbers are brilliant, and the DVD features an option to play them all in a row! Although this is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen, i must say there are times when i laughed out loud at the characteristic overacting of a horror film star. Also I was not used to the occasional switch between hindi (the primary language) and english phrases, so that provided more than a few laughs. The movie does run a little long at points and could have benefited from better editing, but overall it is worth the almost 3 hours it takes to watch, and you will find yourself humming the tunes long after its over.",1123113600,,813,4.217948717948718
