8412689,5,B0041ETK1Q,"I love this movie mostly for its cuteness and determination. This movie is a reflection of how valuable some of the simplest items are for poor people. (Spoiler) Here you have an older brother who made the mistake of leaving his little sister's shoes unattended and since then, he went through great lengths in order to ensure she had something to wear on her feet. In doing so, he picked up a lot of practice running which would later benefit him. The father tries his best to provide for the family but becomes a victim of circumstance. This is not entirely a movie for the whole family. There are some adult themes in it. This is my only criticism of the movie - for the most part it is a family movie that includes childish music and imagination, but they should've left the violent scenes out of it. Darsheel is a great little actor. This was his second film - his acting debut was in the movie Taare Zameen Par (Like Stars on Earth) and the title of this movie was actually named after the dance song that was in that movie. This is a Hindi version of the Iranian film ""Children of Heaven"".",1423612800,,1096,4.377450980392157

Also keeping close to family and supporting one another. I don't know why strange review above, I absolutely loved it, especially Like Stars on Earth, these Bollywood capture emotion and surprise, American movies are have too much Gore, Violence, shooting, etc.......... I highly recommend this and watch the subtitles, easy to follow.",1393372800,,472,5.306666666666667
8412691,1,B0041ETK1Q,I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter and it was entirely inappropriate and gave her nightmares. Contains both sex and violence.,1379980800,,136,4.956521739130435
8412692,3,B0041ETK1Q,"Starring Darsheel Safary of the 'Tare Zameen Par' fame, the film's pivotal essence is a unique brother-sister relationship. Priyadarshan has very perceptively carved out the innocent and poignant story of two siblings and the dilemmas they face in life and how they fight their way to overcome it. ""BUMM BUMM BOLE"" brings out the hidden child inside all of us... Two little feet, one long journey.",1300406400,,397,5.03030303030303
