8173325,4,B000MX7UCG,"At Christmas evening arrived to Brook's house, brother of her and his ex-girlfriend with fiances had been psychologically stalked, physically abused, murdered and kidnapped by Marcus telling stories of Brook's arriving, laying tortured and later killed in a home bathroom.

Nice performing but I could not watch this sadistic piece if knowing a plot prior to.",1221782400,,359,5.410714285714286
8173326,1,B000MX7UCG,"Although I did not see the movie in whole, I did watch a great deal of it with my hubby. We both agree, this movie was HORRIBLE and we regret having rented it. We both enjoy a good thriller and perhaps an occasional slasher film - but this movie just was not for us at all. I think this movie was suppose to be a psychological thriller/horror, but it came off more as just psychopathic. The characters spoke like salty sailors and the movie was loaded with f- and s- cussing. This was supposed to be a dinner party with a central character they all cared deeply for during Christmas time, but they cast aside all their civility at the drop of a pin. I don't ever care to hear the question, ""Where's Brooke?"" ever again. On thing is for sure, Marcus is played decently enough to want to hate him thoroughly - I sure did. Two thumbs down/1 star from both hubby and I.",1175299200,2,865,4.248484848484848
8173327,5,B000MX7UCG,"This is my type of movie; low budget, unknown actors, character driven, limited murder -vs- everybody being slashed in every other scene. This movie was about each chracter being pulled together by the mystery of Brooke's abscence: Brooke, who everybody knows and Marcus' dominance of the household: Marcus, who nobody knows or likes. Each character brings their baggage which boils over at the end. The story is great. Movies like this and actors like these should be walking the ""Red Carpet"" and winning Oscars. The acting was superb and very believable. I picked this little diamnond up at Wal-Mart because of the  right up on the back,and because I am a slasher flick addict. This turned out to be way more than a slasher flick. This turned out to be a great sit-down, can't-miss a minute of it movie. I would recommend it to anyone. By the way did anyone else wonder why no one had to use the bathroom? Who takes their bleeding nose to the kitchen ,instead of the bathroom? Nonetheless, great, great movie.",1174694400,2,1011,4.744318181818182
8173328,4,B000MX7UCG,"This film is a throwback to the old school classic films of the 1950's and 1960's. Highly influenced by Hitchcock and Polanski, the film starts off slow building tension amongst it's extremely flawed characters but erupts with disturbing violence and terror in the final act. Definitely a film worth watching for those who enjoy classic films.",1173744000,,343,5.142857142857143
8173329,5,B000MX7UCG,"This is a movie worth watching styled after the old Hitchcock thrillers with irony and twists.  It's a Christmas gathering of family and friends who have more on their minds than making merry.  Each is so involved in his own selfish and hidden agenda that tensions peak dramatically.  The only one in complete control is the unexpected guest, Marcus, who captivates all with his alarming demeanor.  As the drama unfolds and hidden secrets are revealed, each character is caught up in a rush of emotions accentuated by the whereabouts of missing Brooke.  Marcus himself, however, has his own hidden agenda leading to the movie's dramatic conclusion.  This low budget suspense thriller compiled by basically a crew of starving artists is an explosive thriller that you must see.",1173484800,4,776,5.070866141732283
