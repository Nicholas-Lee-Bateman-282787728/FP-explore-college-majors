3896212,5,B002BWP3WU,"As a journalist who has reported from Asia and understands the life-and-death pressures in Burma (or Myanmar), I highly recommending this new-to-DVD documentary. ""Burma VJ"" is essential viewing for anyone concerned about grassroots peacemaking, powerful new-media tools and the awe-inspiring courage that religious convictions can fuel in ordinary men and women. We've all seen far too much TV footage of homicidal suicide bombers--religious fervor fueling the destruction of innocent lives. In ""Burma VJ,"" we see ordinary men and women courageously risking and sometimes sacrificing their own lives on behalf of peace.

One wonders: Why do these people do it? Their chance of peacefully toppling the ruthless military government of Burma/Myanmar is slim. In fact, as you know before you even watch this film, the protesters did not succeed in the 2007 movement. So, why even atempt this challenge? The question is answered by one of the young filmmakers in ""Burma VJ"" who dares to shoot footage of Buddhist monks attacked by thugs from the military dictatorship. Why do these monks inspire this young man? He answers: ""They are acting out of their knowledge of history. They are not acting out of anger.""

Stunning. Their faith is unshakeable in its assumption that goodness will prevail. If not 20 years ago in the last major protests, if not in the 2007 protests--then in the next wave they are organizing secretly even as you read this review. And we're not talking about mere risks. Toward the end of the film, your heart will break in a scene that was carried by news networks around the world: a beaten monk's body drifting away in a river. After decades of severe repression, poverty and the constant threat of random arrest, torture, imprisonment and even death--for the people of Burma to peacefully protest against their military government takes incredible courage. We learn that two decades ago, the last time large-scale protests were launched, the effort ended when 3,000 innocents were gunned down in the streets. You'll learn about what happened to the 2007 protests in this film.

For a talented young man or young woman to take a small video camera and become an illegal Video Journalist, a ""VJ,"" takes almost a crazy kind of faith and courage. For these young people to film police brutality against monks, for example, could be a ticket to torture and death. But, inspired by their Buddhist practice, dozens of VJs captured shocking scenes during street protests in 2007.

You may be asking: Why not just turn away? Can such a documentary accomplish any good? Over and over again in this film, the young journalists of Burma voice the one question that haunts their sleepless nights: Will anyone care? If we risk our lives to smuggle this footage out of Burma, will anyone watch? Fortunately, the VJs found a valuable friend in Scandinavian filmmaker Anders stergaard, who finally pulled this documentary together for them. And, if you watch their film--and spread the word--then they've found a friend in you, too.",1277251200,6,3036,5.066
3896213,5,B002BWP3WU,"I saw this movie at SXSW last year, and it really interested me because my mom and her side of the family is from Burma.  I knew that there were problems going on in Burma, but I wasn't really familiar with any more details regarding the problems. Watching the footage made me feel as though I was watching something that I wasn't allowed to watch, and I wanted everybody to watch and learn what was going on in Burma. Everybody should be able to record and document what is going on in life, and I really appreciate Anders stergaard going out and making a film about the problems in Burma.

After watching the movie, I felt so much more educated about the subject. I wanted to learn more about it, and I wanted my mom and the rest of my huge family to watch it.  I told everyone about it, and it was definitely my favorite documentary at SXSW 2009...and probably of the whole year. I'm so glad that it received an Oscar nomination, and I really think it should have won.",1274659200,2,971,4.324175824175824

3896215,5,B002BWP3WU,"I had the chance to see this movie when it went on tour and stopped in my city. I loved it. It is an extremely well-made documentary, but, oddly enough, seems more like an dramatic movie than a documentary. It follows several undercover journalists in the military dictatorship of Burma. The film follows them as they document the anti-government protests that took place in 2007 (also known as the ""Saffron Revolution""). The film keeps a quick pace and I actually found it quite suspenseful, even though the events took place over two years ago. The viewer is never sure whether the journalists will successfully evade arrest or even survive their next encounter. For those viewers not as familiar with the events of the Saffron Revolution, I expect the film will be all the more exciting.

On another note, the footage in the film is incredible. The journalists used primarily handheld Sony videocameras, often hidden in bags in order to evade military spies. Yet, they filmed some incredible moments. Much of their documentation was fed to the international media and made headlines in September 2007. However, Burma VJ shows uncut versions of those scenes. Some of the images, such as the massive crowds cheering on the monks as they sang Robin Hood-esque songs, brought tears to my eyes. What those journalists did was incredibly brave, and unfortunately some of them lost their freedom in their attempt to tell the truth about Burma. This film is a wonderful testament to their courage.

If you're not as familiar with Burma, you might want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Rangoon/dp/B00005JN7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Rangoon</a>, a historical fiction about the 1988 protests, for some background before you go.

If Burma VJ is playing in a theater near you, definitely check it out. Hopefully it will show in a general release or be issued on DVD soon.",1249084800,18,1933,5.26948051948052

8362198,5,B002BWP3WU,"This documentary offers an astonishing inside look into the 2007 ""Saffron Revolution"" in Myanmar through the cameras of the independent journalist group, Democratic Voice of Burma. While 100,000 people (including Buddhist monks and students) took to the streets to protest the country's repressive regime that held the country hostage for over 40 years, foreign news crews were banned to enter the country and the Internet was shut down. The Democratic Voice of Burma, a collective of underground video journalists (VJs) recorded these dramatic events on handycams and smuggled the footage out of the country, broadcasting worldwide the peaceful protests, arrests, and the corpse of a monk floating in a Rangoon creek. Risking imprisonment, the VJs vividly document the brutal clashes with the military and undercover police - and then they themselves became targets of the regime.",1362355200,,881,5.485294117647059
8362199,3,B002BWP3WU,"I guess I'll get used to it, but having this film on my computer is not as convenient as having it on a portable disc. I plan to download it myself.",1356998400,,148,3.806451612903226
8362200,1,B002BWP3WU,"Probably a great movie, but made the mistake of paying USD10 for this movie using the Amazon Instant Video App. Turned out to be a waste of time and money, as I was only able to download 50% of the movie and then it froze. Tried everything, but haven't been able to continue the download, and am therefore unable to watch this movie... very disappointed with Amazon Instant Video :(",1351641600,,382,4.4714285714285715
8362201,5,B002BWP3WU,"Atrocities are prevalent throughout the world and some get more attention than others. I've read the other reviews, and am compelled to add my 5-stars. Aside from the courageous efforts of the filmmakers to bring attention to the miserable situation in Burma, the question remains regarding why the UN has done nothing to address the situation. To me, the unspeakable cruelty of the military regime in Burma is unconscionable, and I don't think enough can be said about the arrogance of that regime. We don't need another war; rather, enlightenment regarding world opinion of the atrocities. This is not a religious conflict, as displayed by the lack of concern to quiet the monks and nuns who went all out in behalf of the populace's well-being. The selfish and mindless acts of brutality and mayhem mean nothing to the military rather than control of a nation dying. Highly recommended, encouraged for all to see. And talk about.",1295568000,,931,4.9743589743589745
8362202,5,B002BWP3WU,A must see for those who want to understand what is happening in Burma and the extent to which people are risking their lives for personal freedom from a dictatorial and paranoid government,1292889600,,189,4.757575757575758
8362203,5,B002BWP3WU,This has been an invaluable resource in our community as we have many refugees from Burma!  It does not depict every day life as we had hoped but it does depict the turmoil they face on a daily basis and why it is they flee the oppressive government.  Many in our community have viewed it and it has opened up conversations for not only our community organizations but Burmese families and refugees.,1290988800,2,399,4.527777777777778
8362204,5,B002BWP3WU,"Here are religious leaders who evidently care about their people. Rather than continue to stay out of politics, Buddhist monks and nuns suffer torture and even death to protest again the oppressive government. It's inspiring for even a Christian like myself. The film is all-around excellent. It's also incredibly emotionally stirring, so be prepared for a tear jerker. For an American unfamiliar with much of what goes on in Communist Myanmar, it was an eye-opener. One small but significant complaint: At times, the dramatizations take precedence, serving only to create extra suspense where none is really needed. Some of this reel time could've been used instead to provide viewers with valuable background information about Burmese political history.",1286496000,,755,5.461538461538462
8362205,5,B002BWP3WU,"Let me put this into perspective of how powerful this film is. People died to give you this footage. This isn't an indie film crew trying to do a story on the Burmese in the safety of the local Holiday Inn. This is Burmese citizens facing fear of death every day to bring you the truth.

You will recognize some of the footage if you were watching the news on Burma at the time. The VJ's in this film were the ones that smuggled footage to western news agencies.

The bulk of the film takes place during the Saffron Revolution. In the footage you can feel the nervousness of the people, the fear of being disappeared. And then the most incredible acts of defiance in the face of almost certain death. This film made me cry a couple times and tears don't come easily to me. The film is narrated throughout and you empathize with the frustration of the narrator because as the audience we are as powerless to stop the killing as he is. This film stands as a testimony to their lives as well as the monks and activists that are currently locked up in secret prisons and executed.
You need to watch this film.
This is what Democracy looks like.",1283990400,7,1140,4.347417840375587
