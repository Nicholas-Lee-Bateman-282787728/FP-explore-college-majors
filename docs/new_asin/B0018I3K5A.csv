Ideally one would have practiced the material in this video before attending such training. It is absolutely detailed and a gem explaining the next, more in-depth work that follows the first (beginners) Energy Arts chi kung set ""Energy Gates"" (which explains Wuji standing/dissolving, the fundamental/quintessential Tai Chi movement ""Cloud Hands"", applying body alignments and energy paths in movement via the ""Three Swings"", and beginning Spinal chi kung via the Tai Chi ""Spine Stretch""). Here Bruce expands on the basics, covering the entire body from head to toe discussing joint lengthening/closing/pumping, expanding/contracting cavities, energy pathways/awareness, and a whole slew of minutia to perfect when practicing the Heaven and Earth form. It is an outstanding video and an invaluable help to stabilize the material learned in ""Energy Gates"" and vital preparation for more advanced Energy Arts chi kung sets as well as fundamental material for the study of Tai Chi, Bagua, and Hsing-Yi. Unfortunately I don't believe Energy Arts still offers this material but hopefully will re-release it sometime. The production quality is poor, but this doesn't matter at all compared to the authentic instruction received.",1358380800,2,1335,5.58128078817734

While the lighting and focus aren't great, they are easily good enough - you will have no problem with the video - the information comes across clearly, the instructions are easy to follow, and the content is amazing.

This is a very easy to learn qigong set. You can learn the outward aspects of the movements / choreography in 20 minutes, however the two movements include many subtle (important) skills - 'opening and closing', lengthening, breathing, moving energy, projecting energy, connecting with external energies (heaven & earth), etc. One could spend a long time mastering all the skills (gongs) that make up this qigong set.  I think this is very good approach because you don't get tied up with complexity of the physical movement - the movements are very simple which allow you to concentrate on the subtle aspects.

As with his books and other DVDs, the author puts a lot of effort into making sure all the details are clear. You can really see the expansion of his back as he breathes - there is no doubt which parts of your body ought move (and ought stay still) as you breathe. The same level of detail applies to all aspects of this set.

I'm guessing this could be the first instructional tape the author ever made? His current DVDs are first rate.  I believe this product has been discontinued, I hope Bruce Frantzis will someday make an updated and expanded DVD of this topic.",1327708800,3,1472,4.686046511627907
