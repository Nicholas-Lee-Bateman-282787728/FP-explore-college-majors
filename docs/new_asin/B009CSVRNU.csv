5315476,5,B009CSVRNU,My favorite in the Law and Order group  I watch it over and over Like the story lines that featre the main characters backgroung,1358553600,,128,4.333333333333333
5315477,1,B009CSVRNU,"I'm a huge fan of the original Law and Order-but grew to love Criminal Intent- most especially watching D'Onofrio and Erbe's characters develop. But this season is terrible. Tragic of course in realizing that Goren and Eames were leaving- and then the writing went to hell! Most of these episodes make no sense. ""Palimpsest"" is possibly the worst-Goldblum overacts the hell out of it (which is nothing new) but there's no clear plot. Other episodes have the detectives telling a women's spouse that she's been cheating on him- the wife's lover is dead-they think her husband did it-so they confront him and leave?? Cue next scene and here's the police, remarkably arriving on time as said husband is beating his wife. L and O may not always have been sticklers for following procedure but this? All I could think if Goren and Eames had this case, they would've bent the rules if they had to, to protect the wive and find the killer. Add to this the pointless addition of Mastrantinio as Captain-who seems to just run around picking up and laying down files-she adds mothing to the story. What a terrible shame. I'm still looking forward to getting the final season. In short-avoid this-or get the first 2 episodes only. Just atrocious. And I'm not sure what reviewer ""Keene"" is talking about - I agree that Mz Erbe is a terrific actress-but she leaves at the end of the 2nd episode (I think her work is terrific in general, she was recently on Broadway playing Pat Nixon-and my favorite episode of hers is ""Amends"" when her husband's murder case is re-opened). But Burrows gets no ""standing ovation"", midway through the episode ""traffic"" she gets some wolf whistles-she's all glammed up having just come from a interview with a Madame of a Escort agency!! Sorry-she is a wonderful actress-but these story lines are just terrible!",1358380800,17,1829,4.809523809523809

I like bringing in Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as the boss of Major Case, but this year is pretty much all Jeff Goldblum all the time.  If you like Jeff, you'll like this season.  I do like Jeff, but his style, which seemed precious and amusing in season 8, seems over the top to me here, as if Dick Wolf and the directors gave him a black check to do any thing he pleased.  I also wanted to see more of the original stars who were pushed out completely.  Still, this is state-of-the-art police procedural.  @hg47",1356220800,,573,4.25

The same goes for season 10 but, what the heck- I bought it anyway just because of Goren and Eames. I've never had any problems with the actors- any of them. I think they are all great. But the stories! Who wrote those episodes? They started getting sketchy season 8 and sunk to the ridiculous by the end of season 10. I can't recommend this season- definitely at this price. It is the only one I don't have but saw the episodes on Netflix. I give it 3 stars purely as a nod to all the actors who had to put up with the silly writing and boring stories.. They ALL deserved better. It's sad to see one of the best detective tv shows ever, start out an A+ and finish with an F",1471219200,,776,4.1118421052631575
5315487,5,B009CSVRNU,Great,1468627200,,5,5.0
5315488,2,B009CSVRNU,"I was generous in giving one extra star because the first two episodes - as much of a downer as they were (""Loyalty"", parts 1 and 2) - still had the focus on Goren and Eames.

Unfortunately, that would be all (until their heralded return in S10, but no one knew that would happen during S9) as Detective Zack Nichols/Jeff Goldblum would become the lead (along with Saffron Burrows and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). I found either one liked Goldblum/Nichols' brand of quirk or one didn't.

You can guess which category I fall into.

But upon Nichols taking the lead, L&O: CI felt like another show entirely. At this point, USA Network was in its quirky show phase with ""Monk"", etc. and maybe wanted this show to fit in. The trouble is, even if the characters could be odd (as I know Goren was), the cases were played basically straight as befitting the franchise. But in S9 we got strange music video-like episodes with songs interspersed with lackluster writing. And ""Palimpsest""...oh, my God. To this day, I have no idea what the hell was going on there and it felt nothing like CI. Hell, I had no idea why the case with Nichols' ex (whom we never heard of before) and her dead father required Major Case. And what was the point of the woman Nichols was talking to? Yes, it was a mess.

I felt badly for Ms. Mastrantonio. She is a capable actress but was literally given squat to do. Ross and even Deakins had a moment or two in the sun.

As for Serena Stevens, perhaps if Ms. Burrows was allowed to use her real voice instead of seeming to desperately try to keep her American accent, she could have relaxed enough as a character with some life to her. As it was, she was dull and Burrows seemed to be going through the motions. And there was no chemistry between her and Goldblum, which made the baffling cases all the more plodding and tedious.

I'll give one glimmer of praise: F. Murray Abraham was good as Zack's shrink dad. And I could at least appreciate - in an abstract way - that unlike the other detectives, Zack seemed to come from privilege. But nothing came of it and this season just felt disconnected from the rest of the series. And I think it says something that the sudden exits of these characters weren't even mentioned the following season. (Thank God it went out the same way it came in, with Bobby Goren and Alex Eames.)

I don't know if this change was mandated by USA Network or VDO/KE's departures or some combination thereof, but to me, it was clearly a failure and I'm glad it was only 14 (technically 16, but those were the two G/E episodes) episodes long. Even if it felt twice as long. If there had to be another team without Goren/Eames, it should have been Mike Logan and Megan Wheeler or Logan and another partner. But at least it was a flash in the pan comparatively.",1466467200,,2805,4.456140350877193
5315489,1,B009CSVRNU,"The Worst season of Law & Order: Criminal Intent by far.

After a rather painful two-part episode premiere where Goren, Eames and Captain Danny Ross are all summarily given the boot. Some worse than others, (Ross gets straight up killed) we are then given a new squad, sole surviving Detective Zack Nichols now paired with Serena Stevens for one of the lamest pairings in crime show history or Law & Order history. No chemistry, no real anything with the two, Goldblum is on Ian Malcolm autopilot through a lot of episodes and the ratings are sinking.
Oh and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the new barely making an impression Captain Zoe Callas.

It's here that the show really sucks, gone is the Goren/Eames drama that infused the previous episodes with something. Gone is Goren's wild behavior, which reaches it's climax with that two part episode that begins this season, and instead it's very boring.

Ungodly boring, the plot lines are sometimes great, ""Abel & Willing"" had a great plot line, it would have been killer with Goren/Eames, but it's flat with Nichols/ Stevens.

And with this season the creators made a huge mistake and the show was now sinking faster and with one desperate last move, knowing they were going down, made a real final season to the show. Which still really did not have enough episodes to it, but hey, it's better than nothing.

By the way some episode involving the Olympics was so controversial or something (maybe stupid corporate and copyright issues) that it has never been seen since on this DVD set or in reruns of Criminal Intent.  Not that it really matters, because it would still probably be another lackluster episode of this piss poor season to sit through.

Seriously this season is really the worst. I guess if your Jeff Goldblum fan, maybe you'd watch it. But it's not his best work either. Don't even buy to watch Loyalty parts 1 and 2, it's just too painful and sad they did this and caused the show to sink faster.",1461715200,2,1967,4.717201166180758

5315531,4,B009CSVRNU,"The Ninth Season of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" opens with a catastrophic two-part story which results in the departure of detectives Goren and Eames, and their boss, from the major case squad.  Their replacements are Detectives Nichols (Jeff Goldblum) and Stevens (Saffron Burrows) and a new boss (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio).  The tried and true format of the series remains the same, as the detectives investigate unusual murders, smoke out the intent of the suspects, and try to wring a confession out of them.

Season Nine offers sixteen new episodes and a procession of interesting guest stars.  The cases range from mob bosses to serial killers to revenge for old murders, and more.  Perhaps most interesting, at least for some viewers, will be the evolving dynamics between the two new detectives.  Nichols is the black sheep of a family of doctors, who sometimes seem over-educated for a detective.  Stevens is a hardworking single mom, transferring in from the Detroit police department.  The two detectives will take awhile to get used to each other's operating styles, but it's fun to watch two talented actors work it out on screen.  Nichols and Stevens are risk-takers, but the new boss usually gives them lots of room to solve their cases.  One of the better episodes involves a serial killer, put in jail by Stevens, who claims to be innocent on the eve of his execution, just as a copy-cat killer seems to strike.  Nichols will be driven beyond the call of duty to obtain the confession that could save his partner's peace of mind.

Kathryn Erbe gets better and better as the series progresses.  D'Onofrio gets closer and closer to going off the deep end, but Erbe becomes more confident and more intelligent.  But when Saffron Burrows walks into Major Case Squad,everything changes.  No wonder the Squad gives her a standing ovation at the end of her first episode.",1358553600,5,677,4.752136752136752
