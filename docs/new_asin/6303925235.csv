I have to say that something like that is easily overlooked when it is a ""little"" disclaimer on the page.  not to mention that isn't typically the first thing that anyone would look for when buying a DVD from Amazon.

727156,4,6303925235,"Let's be honest.  You already know the beginning, middle, and end to this movie.  You know it even if you haven't watched it.  Nonetheless, is an enjoyable, albeit incredibly predictable Disney sports flick.  Basically, it's Little Giants with a European translation of Football.

When the film begins, an attractive, teacher named Anna Montgomery (Olivia d'Abo) arrives in a small town as a visiting teacher - sort of a teaching abroad half-year deal from England, but without the bad teeth.  Anyway, she's a horrible teacher; so she decides to teach her lessons via soccer indoctrination.  The kids would rather be doing something more fun, like covering themselves in Cheetos and letting birds eat off of them.

Anyway, the kids name their team after their field in a nearly-stolen-from-Mighty-Ducks concept, and the teacher gets them to play soccer.  Naturally, the kids suck when they first begin to play.  They're so bad it's almost as if each kid suffers from vertigo or something; they completely lack any sort of athletic ability or coordination.  And, the fat, red-headed kid from Sandlot plays a goalie who is afraid of the ball (like Goldberg the goalie from Mighty Ducks), and sees opponents as ninjas, terminators, and zombies (like visions of puppyheads from Waterboy).

Soon enough, just as the sun rises, the movie follows the Disney movie sports formula.  The kids that sucked start to win, lose to the best team in town inevitably coached by a jerk, the kids learn life lessons, insert goofy character (Steve Guttenberg), at least one kid on the team overcomes some sort of difficulty, and the good guys vs. bad guys finale for this genre.  I'll let you guess who wins.

It's typical, easy to pick apart for a paint-by-numbers script and mediocre acting, but it's still fun enough to enjoy.",1206921600,11,1809,4.983333333333333

727158,4,6303925235,This movie is very entertaining.  My daughter really enjoyed it since she plays soccer and could relate to the kids learning to play and be a team.  Lots of slap-stick comedy that anyone would enjoy.,1163030400,3,199,4.6571428571428575
727159,5,6303925235,"I own 'The Big Green' on VHS and it's a great movie. It's about this really small town with nothing to do (they don't even have a pizza hut!) called Emma, Texas where the 'big kids' are used to taking the 'laid-back' approach on school. All of them at the begining have bad attitudes toward their new teacher Ms. Mountgumry (i know thats spelled wrong) a young teacher from England that tries to inspire and modivate the kids but at the begining doesn't have very much luck.
While trying to teach Geography Ms. M decides to try to get the kids attention by breaking the globe on her desk and begin to do a soccer 'trick' the kids are very impressed and this begins the story line for the rest of the movie. She decides to form a soccer team with Sheiff Tom helping her couch (but at first the only reason he's there is because he's smitten with Ms. M) although the kids hate the idea.
Ridicously they have their first game against an all-wining but snotty team 'the knights' with an a hole for a couch (couch Jay) who takes an interest in Ms. M. and grew up with Sheiff Tom and constantly puts him down.
Of course, they get slaughtered and humiliated. After this the kids are ready to forget the whole thing.
But Sheiff Tom and Ms. M pushes them to keep trying, they get their team name 'The Big Green' and keep trying even though they still suck.
Their luck changes when the new kid in town and in class Duan moves with his mother and although he's very quiet and they tease him in class at first they come to find out he's an extrodinary talent in Soccer. After begging his mother to let him on the team, he's on the team and they start getting better more encouraged and start winning games.
Everythings good until a family situation threatens to drive Duan out of town with his mom right before the final game against the team that slaughtered them before, The Knights.
(Ms. M and Knights Couch Jay makes a bet that if the knights win Ms. M will kiss him, but if The Big Green wins he has to kiss their mascot ernie *a painted green goat*)
it's a funny and sometimes touching ride that I recommend watch when your relaxing at home and need something to watch. It's for all ages something you can watch with your family or even by yourself.",1082678400,,2243,4.330166270783848
727160,5,6303925235,"Yes, it seems like you're typical storyline, but it's told with so much more enthusiasm and the actors are much more realistic than the other 'oh they can't play but by the end they're champs'.  It also is set in a small-town, however most that I've seen are in big cities.  This is just a classic-the acting is superb, and the kids' are just to adorable, especially the little boy.  One thing that is typical; the overweight kid
plays the barely-as-to-move position.",1055203200,,467,4.670731707317073
