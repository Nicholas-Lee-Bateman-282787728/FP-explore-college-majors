1208174,5,B00000F5KA,This film is the touching story of Edna Spaulding fight to keep her home and children after her husband is killed by a drunk with a gun. A little story about the way i think. When there is something tuff in my life I think of this movie. And how you can do any thing if you have to do it. The most touching part of the movie is when Edna's picking cotton and how her hand's are cut from the thorn's of the cotton buds. And how she is crying from the memory of her husband it makes me cry just watching that scene. Also the acting by Lindsey Crouse is touching as Edna's younger sister. I just wish the DVD had extra with it. But i didn't buy it for the extra's. I bought it because I love this movie from the heat. Sally will always be special in my Heart. By the way i named My Pom puppy after her. SALLY PUMPKIN.,1007251200,6,814,3.9393939393939394
1208175,5,B00000F5KA,"This 1984 film stars Sally Field as a mother struggling to raise her two children alone, but she soon gains the help of Danny Glover, in one of his best roles, since The Color Purple.  She also takes over the care of a blind man, played by John Malchovich, who delivers an incredible performance.  This film earned Field's her second oscar, and you can certainly see why.
If you have never seen this film, since it has long been unavailable to own, but has now thankfully been re-released on DVD. Although, short on extras, you can chose your choice of full screen or widescreen, and it includes the theatrical trailer.  Definately a must have!",1004486400,7,644,4.631578947368421
1208176,4,B00000F5KA,"Now that ""Places in the Heart"" has been re-released on VHS and DVD, many more people will be able to experience this 1984 classic. Starring some of the acting greats like Sally Field, John Malkovich, Ed Harris, and Danny Glover, ""Places in the Heart"" is a realistic look at the lives and views of people in the 1930s. This movie tackles issues such as racism, adultery, and people learning to ""live again"" after they've had to overcome many obstacles.
Edna Spalding (Sally Field) plays a woman recently widowed who suddenly has to figure out how to support herself and two children during Depression times. Moze (Danny Glover), a black man looking for room and board, offers the ""crazy"" suggestion of growing cotton and, desperate to try anything to keep her family together, Spalding steps up to the challenge. More important than Spalding's need for money, she must prove to herself and those around her that she can take care of her family. She had always just been a wife and a mother and nothing more had previously been asked of her. A blind boarder, Mr. Will (John Malkovich), ""sees"" the harshness and bigotries of life and is a quiet yet interesting observer of what's going on around him. Also added to this mix are Spalding's brother-in-law Wayne (Ed Harris) and sister Margaret (Lindsay Crouse) who go through marital struggles when Wayne becomes involved with another woman (Amy Madigan). They fight the basic human problem of being good people but making bad decisions.
Field's performance as Spalding is a great one--evidenced by her Best Actress Oscar for the role. Another Oscar was rewarded for Best Overall Screenplay and nominations were made for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Malkovich), Best Supporting Actress (Crouse), and Best Costume Design. Though ""Places in the Heart"" is often overlooked, it's a wonderful film overflowing with love, bravery, friendship, and strength of character.",1004140800,30,1931,5.0754716981132075
1208177,5,B00000F5KA,"Places In The Heart is director Robert Benton's look back at life in Depression era Texas.  Sally Field stars as Edna Spalding, a recent widow who struggles and fights to keep her family together by raising cotton.  She enlists the help of a drifter named Mose who knows the in and outs of growing cotton.  One hurdle is that Mose is black and the locals make it rough on them.  Danny Glover is superb as Mose as is John Malkovich as a blind boarder, Mr. Will.  Lindsay Crouse and Ed Harris are Edna's sister and brother-in-law and Ms. Crouse is excellent as she struggles with the philandering ways of her husband.  But through it all, Ms. Field carries the film.  She perfectly conveys the determination of a woman facing tremendous odds.  she shows a strong front, but a touching vulnerability when facing set back after set back.  Ms. Field deservedly won her second Best Actress award and yes we really do like her.",1002672000,58,920,4.595092024539877

1208598,1,B00000F5KA,"This movie is mostly baloney. 1935 Jim Crow Texas would not have known of a character like Sally Field's Edna Spalding (in the remarkable sense). And Glovers character (Moze) woulda been lynched the moment he was caught with the stolen silver (Edna woulda pressed charges. I even question the point of Moze stealing the silver). But I knew this movie was whitewash when 1. the accidental shooting of the sheriff is made to justify (what was oftentimes - according to Ida B Wells-Barnett - unjustified, unrelenting, sadistic white male terrorism) the lynching of Wylie (even Moze's thievery sets black presence in the movie in ambivalent light: they are untrustworthy killers and thieves (I.e. undesirable outsiders), so the presence of the KKK is validated and the attempted lynching of Moze is rationalized) 2. the rope hanging Wylie was wrapped around his torso rather than his neck. Lol. If Field's character was truly humane and moral (rather than a passive racist at best) she wouldve condemned the mob when it arrived at her house with wylie tied to the backend. This woulda made her seem detached from the white-terrorist-way, and affected from us more sympathy and compassion for her overall struggle. Instead, the scene where the mob shows up on Ednas property with wylie lynched and dragged is supposed to assuage Ednas participation in the heinous act of mob violence. The writer/director could've done more here. Instead the director creates (questionable, and even christian) scenarios designed to buffer white barbarity, brutality and sadism (wylies murder, the crooked bank motives behind Ednas threatened eviction, the presence of the KKK and it's mob justice - albeit the Klan included sheriff's. Which means the slain sheriff woulda been a klansman). And the final scene coulda been powerful had the director not placed the slain sheriff and lynched black kid side by side...in a white church...in 1935 Jim crow south.  What a joke. He shoulda ended it at the point the banker drank the wine. This woulda been a powerful revealing of the irony of these white Christians and their racist hearts (a point revisited many years later in MLKings stirring essay ""Letter From. Birmingham Jail"" in his book Why We Can't Wait). The white church scenes in general are powerful in that they reveal moral contradictions. I also found it interesting that wylies lynching (and the legal injustice thereof) is left unexplored and unexamined particularly by/within Wylies community. I could spend a dissertation wortha space pointing out the historical flaws of this junk of mess. But I guess it's Hollywood.",1468713600,2,2610,5.141176470588236

If I was watching this film in a normal days, I would have complained because I don't like TV movies that much.
But today was kind of different day.
It was rainning and I had a couple of beers. I was kind of tired.
I needed a good warm movie to feel good.
This movie was just that.
There are some bad things happened in this movie like Sally field's husband dies, or KKK hit Danny Glover brutally. But most of all the story has this warm feeling. I would say some 50-60s movie feeling.
I don't have to be nervouse watching this movie. Just relax and see it.
Whenever I need a place to lean on, I think I will watch this movie again.
This is the movie for those who need home.

Oh, one more thing. Ths sound is mono. Knowing that the movie was shot in 1980s it would have been better if it was stereo.

1208897,5,B00000F5KA,"At the risk of sounding like I'm giving too much away, there's a strange bookend at the end. The film begins and ends in a typical south-mid-west Protestant church in America. Two characters who were killed at the beginning appear again as the final two figures seen. If you haven't seen the film yet, you won't expect where they show up, and hopefully I won't be accused of offering a ""spoiler"". Endless speculation and debate about their reappearance has been written about ad infinitum, even by reviewers during the time of the film's initial release in the mid-1980's.

The first scene is a Protestant church in rural America where ""Rock of Ages"" (not the Def Leppard version) is a mainstay of the musical repertoire. Edna Spalding (Sally Field in an Academy-Award winning performance) is the wife and mother in a family of four in the rural south in Texas in the midst of the Depression. She is married to the unquestioned man-of-the-house, Royce Spalding, the sheriff of this small town. As the film progresses, we learn his role in the family was far more than simply the ""bread-winner"". In addition to providing a good income, he took care of all bills, the finances, the mortgage on their house, even discipline.

However, we don't learn about his role as head of the household by seeing him pay the mortgage and the bills, etc. At the very beginning of the story, Royce is killed at the hands of a young black man, Wylie, who was playing with a gun while drunk, a deadly combination. We get the sense Wylie had no intention of killing the white sheriff, but, as it was in those days, the accidental shooting signed the epitaph of Wylie as well. The two bodies are brought to their respective families and friends, with a brief appearance of the lynched Wylie being dragged behind a truck passed the house of the Spalding residence. This act will change the course of the Spalding family.

After the social gathering mourning the deceased at the Spalding residence has ended, and the fried chicken and coffee cake have been consumed, Edna is dealt a curve ball care of the local bank via their powerless lackey, Mr. Denby (Lane Smith). After stating his willingness to help Edna in anyway, Mr. Denby tells her the bank would prefer if she sold their home and property in order to pay off the loan for the house. Inappropriately, he makes other suggestions about how to temporarily break up her family since they will be effectively homeless. (It is a snapshot into why life insurance became popular in the wake of the Depression.) She declines his suggestions and offers different ideas about how to create income for her family, but Denby rejects all of them, as if a woman was incapable of doing such things. His only concern is about the bank receiving its payment.

However, Edna resolves to make a go of trying to create income for her family. She solicits the help of Moze (Danny Glover in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a middle-age black man who offered his help earlier in exchange for room and board. They decide to plant cotton in the nearly 40 acres of land owned by the Spaldings. Shortly thereafter, Mr Denby returns to the Spalding residence, and being the good Christian that he is, offers an arrangement which will make the bank happier about her keeping the property. He proposes to have his brother-in-law, Will (John Malkovich), a blind man injured in the Great War and currently unwanted by his family, to rent a room at the Spalding household as way to generate income. At first Edna declines the offer until she realizes she's not in a situation to refuse income, and so Will moves in, called Mr. Will by the kids and Moze.

The five members, Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the children become a new family from the ashes of the old. During the story, Edna learns to do all the things her husband used to do, such as creating income and signing checks, even disciplining the children with corporal punishment. At first, Mr. Will despises his circumstances, but gradually comes to care for and even love the children and Edna and even Moze. When a tornado descends upon the town, the family becomes unified in a way they hadn't expected. And towards the end, Mr. Will defends Moze, and this rings of some of the themes present in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", both the book and film.

There is one side story which distracts from the main storyline: Wayne, the husband of Edna's sister Margaret is having an affair with the local schoolteacher, Viola. Several scenes involve these other four characters interacting with one another. Unfortunately, these scenes were not as interesting as Edna et al, and it diminishes their storyline which is really the main focus of the film. As much as I like the talent of Ed Harris, Lindsay Crouse, and Amy Madigan I would have preferred their sequences cut with more screen time offered for the developing relationships between Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the kids.

Still, a fine film with incredible acting work. This may be the best acting of the three leads, plus honorable mention of the two young actors, Yankton Hatten and Gennie James as the kids Frank and Possum. Field certainly is as compelling as ever, but the other leads Glover and Malkovich not only keep up with her stride-for-stride, but make the story compelling from start to finish. And the two small roles of the sheriff and Wylie reappear at the very end, as if to remind us what led to the paths taken by the main characters.",1439769600,3,5462,4.7011494252873565

1208985,4,B00000F5KA,"When ""Places in the Heart"" hit the theaters in 1984, many people in the audience probably thought that the events depicted in Robert Benton's Oscar winning script were exaggerated at best or never existed in the first place. The America that they were living in was enjoying  relatively prosperous times with Wall Street and the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles reaching new heights. But that wasn't always the case. Just fifty years before, the country was in the midst of the Great Depression and as hard as it was to survive in cities around the country, rural areas were especially hard hit. Writer/Director Robert Benton drew on his memories of growing up in rural Waxahachie, Texas in 1935 centering the story around the everyday lives of ordinary people and a community that must pull together in order to survive the hardships that have befallen them. Twilight has now released ""Places in the Heart"" on Blu-ray for the first time and the results are outstanding. Originally released by Tri-Star Pictures, Sony(who owns the rights) has provided an outstanding print to Twilight and viewers will be more than pleased with the results now that it is finally on Blu-ray. Twilight has given the film a high bitrate(29.99) and it is a vast improvement over the standard DVD. ""Places"" was photographed by the great cinematographer Nestor Almendros and his use of natural lighting during filming is one of the highlights of this new Blu-ray. Although filmed in color, the Depression was not meant to be pretty and although colors are sharp and sometimes vivid throughout the film(costumes, sets designs, interiors and exteriors being especially prominent), it is not overpowering and instead is more about  feeling and atmosphere than anything else. As good as the daylight scenes look, nighttime scenes are more of a problem and this is where the Blu-ray comes up short. There is visible grain present in these scenes and it can be somewhat distracting. However, there are no vertical lines, dirt, torn or damaged frames and overall this is another outstanding Blu-ray presentation from Twilight. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) has been cleaned up also and is free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.). In fact, viewers may have to lower the volume during the famous tornado scene which is very loud and certainly adds to the frightening nature of the event. Performances are top notch with Sally Field being especially effective in her Oscar winning role(her second). Steering clear of making her character overly sentimental, Field is outstanding in one of her best performances of her career. Although events have left her with a mostly sad look on her face during most of the film, viewers will be quick to admire her determination rather than feel sorry for her. Her delight at having her son ask her to dance is not only one of the bright spots of her life but also one of highlights of the film. She gets great support from Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Lindsay Crouse, Ed Harris and Amy Madigan. ""Place in the Heart"" is 111 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.85:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include an isolated film soundtrack, audio commentary by Sally Field and film historian Nick Redman and the Original Theatrical Trailer. Included with the Blu-ray is an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a solid clear Blu-ray case similar to the ones used by Criterion. ""Places in the Heart"" is about the human experience during one of the most difficult times in America and contains one of the most profound endings that is still powerful today as it was over thirty years ago. It comes highly recommended.",1438128000,,3703,4.980613893376414

1209112,5,B00000F5KA,"This is the movie that gave Sally Field a much-deserved Oscar. This is also the film that gave Danny Glover and John Malcovich their first major exposure to the public. They are great in their respective supporting roles, sometimes making you laugh, other times wince with pain, other times empathize completely. See where they are now! The photography and music is perfect, especially the totally appropriate church songs. Set in a small central Texas town during the Depression, this film shows what a complete lie is perpetuated by ""Gone With the Wind"" and its depiction of the ""happy cotton-picking slaves"" prior to the Civil War. Edna Spaulding (Field), who has led a relatively sheltered life until tragedy suddenly strikes and uproots her entire family life as she has known it, must endure what the ""happy"" slaves once endured for years. And the final scene -- well, there is no way to say anything about it to keep from ruining it, other than: It comes totally unexpected. Roger Ebert didn't like it because it didn't fit with the rest of the movie. I couldn't disagree more. Roger often misses the point of a movie's ending. This is one scene that I could watch over and over, and it makes me tear up every time. At its core is a deeply held spiritual belief that transcends all other concerns. This is a must see movie!

1209116,4,B00000F5KA,"Good movie. I had seen it before and thought I would like to have it in my library. I must disagree with some in put about the acting. I thought it was all right on. However, it is not an uplifting movie. It is a movie about a life style that is not usually deliberately chosen, but it is about people who try to make the best of things, ~ as much as their optimism and strength will allow.

I would even go so far as to say this film could be deemed educational.

Interestingly, some folks hang on, even when their lives seem little more than a  'day in and day out' struggle. It is sometimes in these annoying struggles that many find that their need, their determination, and a little stubbornness can keep them reaching for something better. Some even notice that the ""better"" part can be, and often is, as simple as experiencing the good in others, and the finding of gentler ways to deal with a variety of frustrations, even in, and maybe especially in, times of overwhelming hardships. Circumstances are not then really the key. The key surely seems to be that we all need to understand and be understood, and when this commonality is evidenced, the results can be powerful. Knowing and caring that others share, have shared, or will share the same old tired times that we have, is a factor far more liberating than indifference or conflict.

I would not say that the script brought us a deep-in-thought type movie, rather, I would say that it is a good example of a lesson that we seem to need to learn over and over again.. I kind of like being reminded.  So, it got 4 stars.",1429920000,,1584,4.392491467576792

1209218,5,B00000F5KA,"I love this movie.  I've seen it several times when it comes on TV so I decided I wanted to add it to my collection.  I felt like I was experiencing all the hardships and emotions right along with the actors.  The struggles of a woman trying to exist and keep her farm by planting a cotton field and then having to actually go in the field doing the back breaking work of  taking each piece of cotton off the plants,bagging it, getting her fingers, hands and arms cut by the sharp pods. It's like you're right there in the field with her.  Excellent direction as well as acting.  I also love the music, the old time fiddle waltz's and the hymns from that era in church.  The era it's taken from is one of my favorites, the 1930's.",1423872000,2,730,4.2086330935251794
1209219,3,B00000F5KA,"There's a super sweetness to ""Places in the Heart,"" but it wears it well. The characters all have little failings, but nothing that can't be quickly overcome in the space of a tender, touching moment. Though many scenes walk right up to the line, they stop short of turning that well-earned tenderness into cloying sentimentality.

The young, cherub-cheeked widow played by Sally Field is can-do-ism personified, and is perhaps more racially tolerant than the norm for 1930s Texas, especially considering that her husband has just been killed by a drunk, black youth. But the movie sells us on the idea that she has bigger problems to worry about than racial politics or even personal loss. The Depression is palpable throughout the movie, and it reshapes her life almost overnight. A neighbor is living in a car, paint on a nearby abandoned house says ""Gone to California,"" and now, with the death of the family breadwinner, Field's character also appears to be headed for bust. Worse, she may lose custody of her two children. With no time to mourn, she has to take in a surly boarder (John Malkovich, thoroughly believable as the blind WWI veteran) and hire a black man who previously stole from her (Danny Glover) in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. If it seems all too predictable that her headstrong determination and positive spirit will prevail, that her worldly-wise black field hand will prove his worth, and that the bottled-up boarder will grudgingly reveal his sensitive side, well... it wears it well.

Perhaps these characters should be thought of in the way that many of us like to think of our grandparents and great-grandparents: a little idealized in our minds, perhaps, but people who we believe were fundamentally good and who lived through difficult and transformative years in our history as soldiers, laborers, school children, and housewives. The final scene in the movie is a creative tracking shot that emphasizes the oneness of this diverse, often fragmented and antagonistic, yet familiar community that we have come to know. It is not just a Texas community, but an American one.

It is hard to say what a slow-boiling side plot about marital infidelity, featuring a young and inscrutable Ed Harris, adds to the movie. There may be some thematic connection to a frightening sequence of a literally home-wrecking tornado. Or maybe it is a way to provide additional color by making the supporting characters flawed and allowing the main ones to remain only nominally imperfect. In any case, this B-plot is not very creatively rendered, and it takes time away from the Malkovich and Glover characters whose private lives would surely be far more interesting but are too seldom seen. This shortcoming, though, does not prevent the main plot from being as affirming and moving as it strives to be.",1423180800,4,2825,4.9809322033898304

I truly do think everyone will enjoy the movie on so many levels, the acting is surprisingly amazing, John Malkovich as the blind boarder is just so amazing to watch!! Danny Glover as the black man to help a family that knows nothing & Sally Field as a lady that is lost after her husbands death truly makes you feel part of this movie!!

It is a strong tale about people carrying more than they thought bare able in a time when the frayed edges of society where not just noticeable, but was quickly maturing and changing our country into what it is today.  This film stands well with other great Depression Era depicting films; such as The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men.  Sally Field won her Oscar on this film and there is never a moment when you doubt why she won.  Her performance is only made better by the other fine actors in this piece: Danny Glover, Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, and John Malochvich.  Heady company to say the least.

1209638,4,B00000F5KA,"Yeah, it's a little corny, and perhaps Edna Spalding (Sally Field) is a little too spunky, and Moze (Danny Glover) a little too saintly, but all in all, this is a very good movie. It's strengths more than make up for its weaknesses.

It's the mid-1930s in Waxahachie, Texas. Edna's husband is a sheriff or a deputy (never got clear on that), who is killed by a drunken black teenager who thought he'd used up all the bullets before he turned the gun on Mr. Spalding. He was wrong. Dead wrong.

Mr. Spalding's body is brought home, followed shortly by a truck full of rednecks dragging the body of the teenager behind them. They give the body back to his family by hanging it in a tree near their home. Nice people, eh?

When Edna goes to the bank to learn how to write a check, she finds that there is very little money on deposit and a substantial mortgage payment is due in a few months. I don't remember the dollar figures, and they would be meaningless in these days compared to those, where Edna's sister is a hairdresser and charges 75 cents for a complete wash and set, maybe even a haircut as well.

So with the help of Moze, who had just dropped buy for a meal-job, and a blind boarder (John Malkovich) forced upon her by the slimy banker, and her two very young but remarkably sturdy and uncomplaining children, she sets out to raise a crop of cotton on her land. She notices that much is made of the first bale ginned, and apparently it includes a $100 bonus. She knows nothing about cotton, but Moze grew up in a cotton field, and they literally work their hands bloody to bring in the crop.

If you have to ask whether they succeed, you don't know Sally Field.

There are several sub-plots about who is in love with whom, and so on, which I could not follow because the people all looked enough alike that I was never sure when the two-timer was with his wife or his mistress. He apparently loved both of them quite sincerely.

What really makes this movie so good is the authenticity, down to the tiniest details. The Spalding house is a real one in the real Waxahachie, Texas. The life of the blind character John Malkovich plays (Mr. Will; is that his first name or his last name?) is so authentic it's hard to believe it was played by a man who really could see. He makes brooms and cane chair seats for a living, which was typical cottage industry for the blind in those years and for many years after. He gets around outdoors by a series of overhead ropes (doubtless also used for clothes lines) that can quickly lead him where he needs to go. And when the KKK pays a visit to rough up Moze, he recognizes each member's voice from having delivered brooms and caned chairs to them. He also has enough courage to scare off the bullies and save Moze's life.

I feel it's that authenticity which gives the movie its heart. You really can be there among them, sharing their troubles and their triumphs, because you can believe they are real. If it weren't for the color and some well-known faces, you could believe you were watching a documentary made at the time of the story.",1336953600,4,3091,4.391608391608392
1209639,4,B00000F5KA,"I was sad to find I didn't love this as much as I had remembered from
its release nearly 30 years ago.

The acting is terrific, and the film looks great. But the main plot has
elements of familiar melodramatic clichs that bugged me more now in a
way they didn't in 1984. The race to save the farm, and the 'we'll do
it despite the odds!' dialogue felt a little too Hollywood this time
around, as did the 'perfect' gallery of downtrodden, oppressed
outsiders (the single mother, the African-American, the blind man).

At the same time, the subplot of the romantic triangle between Ed
Harris, Lindsay Crouse and Amy Madigan, while wonderfully acted, really
seemed to have very little at all to do with the rest of the film.

That said, all the acting (Sally Field, Danny Glover, John Malcovich)
is terrific, and the details of time and place are rich and vivid is
slightly (intentionally) softened by the haze of the passing years
(Benton grew up in the town where the story takes place).

And that wonderful long last shot, which gives the whole film a larger
context, is still a powerful and brave way to end a story.",1327708800,4,1117,4.54228855721393

1209726,5,B00000F5KA,"This is the best movie I've ever seen, starring my all time favorite actress, Sally Field. Sally won an academy award for best actress for her part in this film, which she very much deserves. She did one fantastic job of acting. So did the people who played the blind man and the black hired hand.

Set in the Great Depression, it portrays people who are tender in their caring for others, very strong in their faith in God and gutsy in their refusal to quit when the going gets tough. In contrast it portrays an insensitive, greedy banker, who shortly after her husband's senseless killing encourages Edna Spalding (Sally Field) to sell her house to pay off the mortgage, go live with her sister and since she doesn't have room to house all of Edna's family, send one of her two children to live with relatives in another state. She bluntly turns down his offer, letting him know that she will find a way to get the mortgage money in on time.

A black man named Mose's (Danny Grover) offer to help Edna grow cotton, while met with initial hesitation, undoubtedly influenced not only by the South's attitude toward blacks, but also by the fact that her husband was killed by a drunken black man is finally accepted. Edna is also coerced by the banker into housing his blind brother Will (John Malkovitch), which turns out to be a real blessing is disguise. Her black hired hand is also a Godsend. He proves to be worth his weight in gold and when the cotton harvest is in, the mortgage payment is more than met. The movie ends on a triumphant note, with blacks and whites setting next to each other in church, receiving communion. The Scripture text for the day is I Corinthians 13. I love movies with happy endings, where good triumphs over evil and where gutsy people, ones who live their faith in God, aren't afraid to stand up to opposition and work to protect their family and moral values from scoundrels.",1241308800,7,1911,4.536231884057971

 My parents, and my grandparents, and my great-grandparents, on both sides of my family grew up on farm land, tending the land, and working in the fields!

I loved the way Mose, and Edna included the young blind man in their life.

1209771,5,B00000F5KA,"This moving film from director Robert Benton brings to life a time and place as few films have ever done. Benton based this on his memories growing up and everything is authentic to the smallest detail. He shows the good and the bad of this area and era in small town Texas. Sally Field deservedly won the Oscar for her natural and poignant performance and Danny Glover is just as memorable.

Waxahachie, Texas, in 1935 when jobs are scarce and justice often left in the hands of men hiding behind sheets is the setting for this tender look at times trying to change before people are ready to. Field is extraordinary as Edna Spaulding, finding she and her two children suddenly alone when her sheriff husband is killed by accident. She has no idea how to support her family and the bank wants her to sale her home and the land around it to pay off her mortgage. She is scared but determined to find a way to stay.

Along comes Moses (Danny Glover) to suggest she use the small amount of land to plant cotton. It will give her enough to save her home and feed her children. But Moses is a black man in a time when a black man is suppose to keep his place. His advice to the innocent Edna prevents others from cheating her and gives her a fighting chance. It also angers those who cannot fathom a black man being smarter than they are.

John Malkovich is terrific also as the blind boarder she takes in, who just happens to be the banker's brother-in-law. The three form a bond as they overcome every obstacle together and each helps out to form a makeshift family unit. Field gives a subtle performance as we see her loneliness for her husband and her love for her little boy Frank and his little sister Possum. The scene where she must now take over the disciplinary duties is particularly moving.

The hardships of nature are shown as well when a storm suddenly appears out of nowhere and even more suddenly turns into a tornado. Edna barely has time to deal with her sister Margaret's (Lindsay Crouse) marital problems. Wayne (Ed Harris) is having an affair with his wife's best friend Viola (Amy Madigan). All the performances have a realistic feel, capturing perfectly life in a small Texas town during the depression.

When Moses helps her make a go of it the racial hatred of the time is shown in a beating that will force him to leave or probably be killed. The scene between he and Edna near the end will surely tug at your heart and anger you at the same time. The anguish of Moses as he knows his time has not yet come is truly the most heartbreaking moment in the movie.

This was a landmark film and not to be dismissed. Many have tried to copy this formula but this one is the real thing. The final scene is one you will never forget. This is a film you must own.",1217721600,10,2777,4.372093023255814
1209772,5,B00000F5KA,"I have watched this movie since I was a little girl and always have been enchanted by it.  I am proud to own the DVD to it now!  Sally Field, yes we do love you!!",1215388800,,162,3.6
1209773,5,B00000F5KA,"This is one of my all-time favourites since I watched this movie more than 20 years ago. I recently found this movie DVD from a public library and was so excited that I can watch it again now! Even it is my second time to watch this movie, I am still deeply moved by it!

The story of this movie took place in the rural Texas when racial discrimination was still a very serious social issue. Sally Fields is the widow Edna whose husband, a sheriff, was shot while on duty by a Black teenager. Her husband left nothing to her because of the Great Depression of the time. She all the sudden has to face the adversity of the real life - how to maintain her home and raise her two childs without any real financial supports.

At this time, a Black guy Moses came to ask for a job but eventually becomes her saviour during this most difficult time of her life. There is a blind man, Mr. Will, was ""dumped"" to her home as a tenant in order to help getting some rental. During the movie, there are times when the Black guy Moses is so strong, and the blind man Mr. Will is so helpless (e.g. in the cotton field and during the storm). However, there are also other times when it is exactly the opposite (e.g. the KKK incident).

All in all, without giving away the plot, I would say that every part of the plot of this movie is wonderfully and tightly knitted together. Every incident in this movie does not happen just for filling up the time but for a purpose - in fact, a very meaningful purpose. It shows that every individual as a human being is simply equal, regardless you are a Black person, a blind man, a widow, or a White man in a society such as this. It further dreams of an ultimate reconciliation - between the different races, social outcasts, and even the murdered and the murderer.

The ending is particularly powerful. In fact, it is the most stunning ending I have ever seen. It is symbolic and it is deeply moving. However, in order to fully appreciate that, you will have to watch the movie from the start to the end without jumping so that you will get a glimpse of what the final reconciliation really means in this story. Also, when you watch this movie, pay special attention to the beginning. As another reviewer rightly pointed out, the beginning and the ending forms a wonderful contrast.

I will give this movie a six-stars if possible! Not only for the beautiful story, but also for the wonderful performance of all the three lead roles and even the two kids. There are not too many other movies as moving and meaningful as this one.",1206921600,7,2556,4.361344537815126

1209776,5,B00000F5KA,"PLACES IN THE HEART is an excellent movie that takes place in 1930's rural Texas.  The movie starts sadly with the tragic death of a sheriff who is also a husband and father.  Sally Fields is his widow, Edna, who is left to deal with an almost Biblical plague of difficulties and setbacks.  Fields' acting is great as she transforms from a woman who did not even know her husband's salary to one who can negotiate a deal with an unscrupulous cotton gin owner.  Danny Glover shows his acting skills as Mose a homeless drifter who miraculously comes to help her save her farm. And John Malkovich is amazing as the bitter blind man Mr. Will.  The subplot about Edna's beauty shop owning sister and her unfaithful husband was not as compelling and did not quite seem to belong in the same movie.
The famous ending at the church during a communion service is very powerful no matter what the viewer's spiritual beliefs and leaves many in tears or with goosebumps.",1178928000,8,958,4.578947368421052
1209777,5,B00000F5KA,"With storytelling of Dickensian authority, brilliant casting matched with excellent performances including the work of the two children, this film remains a very strong candidate as one of the best American movies of the 1980's.  The central story  follows the story of two sisters in parallel - one loses her husband through an accident in the line of duty, the other (nearly) loses her husband through his infidelity.  The widow overcomes her loss through faith in her ability to prevail, through ignoring the question of race - her husband was shot dead by a young black boy - and through love.  Her sister forgives her unfaithful husband.  The film does not ignore the cancer of racism in a country that professes to be ""the land of the free"", nor does it ignore the struggle those of the land face with the forces of nature - and banks.  It is all of a whole and adds up to more than the sum of its parts.  Brilliant but not flashy.  It seems as real as the land it depicts.",1175558400,9,979,4.491525423728813

 It is a clear example of a structured good history, which is divided clearly in stages that we could call ""Grief and Hope"", since from a principle everything seems dark for the protagonist. But thanks to their tenacity, it can leave ahead and improve a past that could project to the future.
 The good presentation of this audio-visual work to a great extent must to Sally Field and John Malkovich, that they take in its shoulders the thickness of history.

1209812,4,B00000F5KA,"Few movies hit you so unabashedly in the heart with a melodramatic wallop as Bentons Places in the Heart, yet manage to avoid feeling cheap. A deeply touching slice of the depression era, worthy of all the Oscars it bagged (screenplay, best actress for Fields) plus several nominations.
Sally Field weilds absolute acting prowess as Edna Spaulding, a wife and mother of two kids who becomes widowed after a drunk accidentally shoots her husband. So she decides to make some money by planting cotton. She takes in a very friendly black man (wonderfully played by Danny Glover) who helps her get and plant the cotton, and a smart blind man (played by John Malkovich in an Oscar-nominated performance) who's a paying boarder.
These three adults and the two children form a little family together, and this is the part of ""Places in the Heart"" that works best.
Other characters add to the story. Lindsey Crouse was also Oscar-nominated for her portrayl of Field's sister who comes to help out after tragedy strikes early on. Ed Harris plays Crouse's husband who's having an affair with another woman, which makes for a somewhat inessential subplot. But that's a minor grouse.
Apart from the top-notch performances, the film's stunning finale is an unforgettable cinematic statement about hope. Had everyone in the room jerking a tear.
On DVD the film doesn't really look like an old movie (1984) if that bothers you. A highly recommended gem for any collection!",1067731200,48,1457,4.951020408163266

Frank would be a strong, honest man that is a representation of the type of person it takes to change an entire country's idea about prejudice.  They would become happy once again.  I want their lives to finally be worth something.  I WANT MORE OF THEIR STORY!",1058400000,14,770,4.321678321678322

As a film it is a true piece of ART with some of the best performances ever assembled! I lived in Waxahachie where much of the film was shot and was in the ""Heart"" house as it is called. Believe me, the cinematography in this film is worth the price of the DVD! Texas never looked better! This film would make a terrific companion piece to ""The Trip to Bountiful"" which was also filmed around the Waxahachie, Texas area. ""Places"" on DVD! It's about time! Now how about ""Bountiful"" on DVD?",1050105600,2,634,4.474137931034483
1209815,3,B00000F5KA,"Sally Fields, Danny Glover, John Malkovich and Ed Harris star in ""Places In The Heart"" as poignant family saga set during the Great Depression.  When Emma Spalding's (Fields) husband is accidentally killed she learns that her financial situation is precariously perched on the acquisition of several acres of farm land and its cultivation for a cotton crop.  To aid in her money problems, Mrs. Spalding takes in a blind man, Mr. Will (Malkovich) and hires a hobo, Moses (Glover).  There are scenes that you will never forget and a real tear jerker of an ending. Sally Fields won her second Best Actress Oscar for this role.
Columbia Tristar has given us the film in a rather mediocre transfer.  Colors are faded.  Contrast can, at times be low.  There is some minor pixelization and edge enhancement that intrudes.  Chips, scratches, dirt and film grain are all quite visible.  The sound is 2.0 surround and rather disappointing, suffering from a weak characteristic throughout. There are no extras to speak of.  BOTTOM LINE: Say yes to the film because it is great entertainment, and try to overlook the rather lack luster transfer, if you can.
Aside: I suppose I should begin each review by stating that my marks (stars)that I give in rating the films are indicative of picture and sound quality and have nothing to do with my overall like or dislike of a movie based on its plot. This is why some universally acclaimed movies, from time to time, may get a less than stellar rating.  Everything is based on the digital quality of the disc - how it looks and sounds.  Mine is not a Roger Ebert film review.",1047340800,23,1607,4.724014336917563
1209816,5,B00000F5KA,"Sally only got 2 Oscar noms, and won both. This seems to be the stock of lots of jokes. Fact is, with great writing, Ms. Field will knock your socks off, as she does here. I won't bother to rehash the plot, cuz you already know it, and it's phenomenal. Aside from the absolute attention to period detail, the acting is, without exception, superb. A previous reviewer noted that the cinematography of Nestor Almendros was sorely missing an Oscar nomination, and this is most correct. There were three films in 1984 about ""saving the farm"" (""Country"", ""The River"" and this); though ""Country"" was released earlier and got better reviews, this one came along and blew 'em all out of the water. This was Benton's autobiographical account of life during hard times, and it couldn't be more lovingly presented. Then, again, there's the acting: Lindsay Crouse, Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Terry O'Quinn, Amy Irving, Ed Harris, and two absolutely wonderful kid-actors, Yankton Hatton & Gennie James. Howard Shore composed a score, not that original, with great help from the music icons of the period. It was very effective. The bottom line is that this is a very fine film, and mostly carried by the unwavering and confident performance of Sally Field. I like her. I really do.",1044144000,7,1271,4.888888888888889
1209817,5,B00000F5KA,"The entire cast of this movie deserves every award for the most uplifing, spiritual film i have ever seen. Even though this takes place in the 1930's i feel very humble and fortunate that i have a wonderful life and only wish my spiritual soul could find the love for faith as much as you'll see in the last scene of this movie. (and i am a spirtual person)  I turn to complete tears in those last few minutes when everyone is singing ""The Old Rugged Cross"" which has always been my favorite hymm. The DVD gives you both formats, either wide screen or full screen. At the end of the movie with the organ and people singing your sub-woofer will kick in with the real low notes of the sound to give you a sort-of surround but still a very rich sound.  I'm not sure why this isn't in 5.1 because it originally was filmed in Dolby stereo in the early stages when Dolby was first being introduced. Never-the-less this is a wonderful wonderful film with the best actors that Hollywood has. Sally Fields is a gem in everything she's in anyway. A superb actress. You will not be disappointed.",1029369600,7,1084,4.388059701492537
1209818,5,B00000F5KA,This truly Sally Field at her best. She is awesome in this role. John Malkovich does a wonderful job playing the part of the blind tennant. Danny Glover......what can you say about him other than AWESOME!!!! Rent or buy this movie today.,1024444800,3,237,4.666666666666667
1209819,5,B00000F5KA,"It begins with communion. No, not a church setting, but something equally spiritual--all manner of families, black and white, poor and not so poor (remember, this is small town Texas during the Depression), sitting down to Sunday afternoon dinner, saying or singing ""grace,"" heads down, holding hands. Circles of families, joined together in brittle and fragile unity against the winds of despair that swept through Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas during the 1930s. Moments of tender mercies.
  ""Places in the Heart"" is a story of circles broken, families shattered, hatred and racism unleashed. After the senseless death of her husband, Edna Spaulding is left to do for herself, and for her family. Her task is clear--to do whatever she can to mend the breach in her family, to keep herself and her children together, to build a new communion.
  With the help of Moses (Danny Glover) and Mr. Will (John Malkovich), Edna (Sally Fields) does all she can to keep tragedy from her door. Whether she succeeds or fails is not, it seems to me, the true heart of this film. No, the center of ""Places in the Heart"" is, again, communion, new circles being formed, old trespasses being forgiven, renewed belief in enduring values.
  This a lovely film, generous of spirit, unafraid to wear its heart and its spirit on its sleeve. The results are moments of aching grace, deep tenderness, unabashed sentiment. This film asks you to feel, to set aside the ironic eye, the cynicism of our time. There are things, the film insists, in which we can and must believe if we are to prevail in a world that is--at best--unrelenting and--at worst--soul shattering.
  Communion--""Places in the Heart"" concludes with several of the most moving and spiritual minutes I have ever experienced in a film. The scene beggars description. To say that the conclusion is epiphanic is not to say enough. You have to watch and listen--and then, thanks to VCR's and DVD's, you have to watch and listen again. Watch and listen to the sights and sounds of communion, of deep, abiding faith, of circles refusing to be broken.
  This past Christmas, I gave my 33-year-old son a copy of this film. He remembered it from years ago. He understood perfectly that ""Places in the Heart"" is a film for sacred seasons, for all seasons.",1011139200,160,2281,4.855670103092783
