8263908,1,B0016PTEDC,"Very dissapointed that Lionsgate had the audacity to release these 2 magnificent masterpieces in such poor quality. These 2 movies are masterpieces and this DVD shows the distributor have zero respect to filmmakkers and audience. Id look for the Bluray disc versions instead of buying this crap! Misleading package information. It is not in full screen, image is zoomed in to appear widescreen. Unaceptable job transfering this films to DVD. Standard definition looks 10x better on Youtube than this crap!",1514764800,3,505,5.325
8263909,4,B0016PTEDC,"The first one of the two movie, ""La Ilusion Viaja en Tranvia"" is typical of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's trajectory as a film maker: to have his characters go here and there, wander around maybe even in circles, take a partly-concerned look at what is going on, and then come back to where you started from. Perhaps it is meant to convey his sentiments after leaving Spain to go to France and the USA, and his hope to return to Spain some day after what is commonly known as ""seeing the world."" The second movie, ""Nazarin,"" portrays a similar situation, a priest who is almost the same type of character as the streetcar drivers in the first movie. But here, he is a Christ-like figure that women tend to love and follow (think Mary Magdalene). He is wandering around, however, trying to help others, not just to see the world.",1501891200,,819,4.54054054054054
8263910,1,B0016PTEDC,"Excellent films, poorly presented. Described as a 2 disc set, it's actually a single, double-sided disc that had come loose in the packaging and stuck to the ""security device"" sticker thing which left its adhesive all over the disc. The disc itself (described in the product notes as being for the US/Canadian market) is not subtitled; this would have been nice to know before purchasing it.",1498780800,5,391,4.9393939393939394

8263912,4,B0016PTEDC,"Considering that the films are part of a series of important movies from the golden era of Mexican cinema. I was dissapointed about the movies released by Lionsgate without subtitles, which contributes to these fine films to be ignored by anyone who does not understand Spanish and is not willing to sit through them for the beauty that they are. I understand the language but, it's a shame that they will not find a wider audience.
 I am giving the films four stars because they deserve it.",1223510400,13,491,4.64367816091954
8263913,1,B0016PTEDC,"As the previous reviewer ststed there are NO English subtitles on this release, even though it is released by Lionsgate, a US company. Don't know if a first pressing issue but beware.",1220745600,30,183,4.75
8263914,1,B0016PTEDC,"Do be aware that this disc is part of a Lionsgate release of classic Mexican cinema, and that there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, despite the information on the Amazon listing page.",1220745600,30,177,4.741935483870968
