8056874,5,B000929V8Q,"I bought this DVD set for the Arthur Gets Lost episode.  I saw it on PBS and I just had to have it.  This episode is one of the few times DW shows any sort of sympathy for Arthur.  Probably one of my all time favorite Arthur shows.  The other DVDs in this set are great too.  I love this show for its wholesomeness.  If the kids call names, it's ""marshmallow"" or ""fruit-head"" and not something derrogatory.  They are humorous without being too cheesy either.  All in all, a super buy!",1178928000,3,484,4.241758241758242
