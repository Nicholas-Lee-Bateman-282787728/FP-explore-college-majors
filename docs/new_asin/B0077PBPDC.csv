5062058,2,B0077PBPDC,"The scenery and camera work are awesome.  I suggest you buy this and then watch it with the sound off.  The script and narration are simply awful.  Hiring a narrator and someone with the skills to write a narrative would have bumped this to the top of the nature documentary heap.  The other problem I had was there was too much in the film about her suffering with arthritis.  Now I have the same affliction so I know how much pain and discomfort she was in.  I just don't think this problem belonged in the program.

But the wolfs and otters make this a must see.  It is also available for streaming on N*tflix.",1375315200,3,613,4.315789473684211

5062060,5,B0077PBPDC,"Great camera work!  Wolves in the wilderness, along with many other wild creatures.  Wish it was longer, but it is still a very good story.  Not many places like this remaining due to over-development and expanded extraction of our natural resources.",1369267200,2,250,5.048780487804878
5062061,5,B0077PBPDC,"Nature: River Of No Return is one of the best documentaries the series has had in a long time that did not focus on a particular species or a particular type of animal. I loved it on PBS and bought it as fast as I could when it came out in HD.

  At a glance, the film is about Isaac Babcock, a biologist, and his wife Bjornen, with whom he travels into one of the few remaining pristine wilderness areas remaining in the United States - the Frank Church River Of No Return Wilderness Area. It contains just under 2.4 million acres of nearly untouched mountain wilderness. The Babcocks document their attempt to live in this wild area for a year with very little contact or assistance from the outside world. While doing so, they explore this amazing place and study the animals that dwell there while doing their best to leave the area as God intended it.

  The video quality is absolutely stunning, not only because of being HD but because the content is that eye-opening. The shots of wolves in their natural environment doing what they do best while barely even registering that humans are around by itself makes this documentary worth a look. The birds, coyotes, and other animals that are also caught in action make this a true journey into another time and place. And all the while you get a glimpse of what life is like without all the modern things that we have so thoroughly convinced ourselves are absolutely necessary in a given day.

  Anyone who even remotely values the wild places of the world will fall in love with this program. If you are someone who dreams of perhaps one day hiking to some of the places God created that we, the human race, have thankfully not destroyed yet, you too will love this documentary. If you are looking for a movie with which you can teach others about why the wild places in this world need protecting, than this is your movie. I recommend this documentary with the highest regards. I give it five stars and would give it more if I could.",1346630400,7,1989,4.487534626038781
5062062,5,B0077PBPDC,"I really enjoyed this story and was done very well, i would recommend this to my friends.  Also, great price, fast shipping!!  :)",1343692800,,129,4.565217391304348
5062063,5,B0077PBPDC,"True high definition in a 16:9 ratio. On-screen promos, websites and station ID's customarily shown during broadcast were thoughtfully excised for the video release. This, coupled with our newlywed hosts' sometimes humorous candidness (particularly their rendition of ""This Land is Your Land"" on harmonica) makes their journey seem as though it is ours as well. So if you're looking for extreme nature (eg. the highest mountains or tallest waterfalls) you won't find it here, but you will get a true sense of the wilderness through some dazzling photography and the occasional mild touch of ethereal scoring, and a surround sound mix that is just enough to evoke a sense of fresh air without drawing attention to itself. There's also a most unexpected miracle that takes place between a hunter and its prey, silhouetted against the evening sky on a mountaintop.",1338854400,4,861,5.1571428571428575
5062064,5,B0077PBPDC,"Most Nature videos have a political agenda today (we are ruining our environment, we must fix it before we perish).  This movie has a rare human quality that most documentaries lack.  Bjornen, the female narrator, describes her own experience with her untreatable illness in a very positive light.  After months living in harmony with nature, she accepts herself as part of the animal kingdom.  Her message to us is that life involves risk; many animals live or die out of luck rather than fitness.  So, rather than live life ""playing it safe,"" Bjornen shares with us the beauty of experiencing life to the fullest, even though her experience involves risk and pain.",1336780800,2,666,4.910714285714286
5062065,5,B0077PBPDC,"I watched the film on Nature and am now ordering the dvd. I just wanted to say that, for me, the narration by the couple both added to my understanding and appreciation of the wilderness area, and the wolves and other inhabitants there; and also was a very moving and brave personal recounting of their struggles on this journey. A film that may leave you with much to think about.",1334966400,8,381,4.457142857142857
5062066,5,B0077PBPDC,Watched on PBS in April 2012; worthy piece by two nature lovers who shared their unusual experience in the wilderness with the rest of us... Great job on a small budget and with very small film crew!,1334966400,2,199,4.405405405405405
5062067,2,B0077PBPDC,"This was broadcast on PBS in April, 2012. The two narrators (husband and wife, the husband a long-time observer of wolf populations in Idaho) spent a year in the Frank Church-River of No Return wilderness in Idaho. They were outfitted with a Red One camera; the footage is at times absolutely phenomenal. It helps that the region they're in is not one overrun by tourists like Yellowstone or many others in the US.

The sad drawback is that the two filmmakers' voiceover is atrocious. They have none of the ease of narration of David Attenborough (on the more formal, styled British side of nature narration) or Marty Stouffer (in a very easy-going, but still exceptionally well-informed American style). It's clear that the lead narrator is deeply interested in his subject, but little if any of that comes across in the voiceover. More often, he and his partner seem to striving for depth while coming across as trite or self-conscious.

That said, some will find the personal quality and honesty engaging. I found the stiffness (or forced 'easy-going-ness') annoying after about 20 minutes.",1334966400,2,1093,5.0

8511858,5,B0077PBPDC,"I'll admit that when I walked into the living room and saw my husband watching this a tiny part of me thought, ""Agh, another documentary!""  But I was soon sucked into it and by the end was such a fan that the next day I bought a copy for my sister.  This is a very real, engaging film.  Unlike so many shows that create artificial drama, this is compelling for being understated drama - two people who come across as very honest, unaffected and likeable filming wildlife and dealing with challenges in an intense and beautiful environment.  The footage is gorgeous, and the story is a good balance about both them and this amazing place they are in.  I have to say that having studied and worked in the wildlife biology field, one thing that really struck me was how honest he was about what he saw during that scene with the wounded elk - very unusual for a biologist, in my experience, and another plug for how real this film is.  Not to mention that it is an extremely beautiful scene from a visual standpoint.  (And symbolically as well - watch the movie. :)  I don't write reviews nearly as much as I should (seeing as I read them), but I had to put in my two cents for this one.",1402272000,6,1184,4.301801801801802

8511860,5,B0077PBPDC,"I really loved this film. What an awesome place. I would love to take a journey through this beautiful wilderness. The only thing I find wrong with this documentary is, it isn't long enough. I felt so calm and peaceful while watching this, I wanted it to continue for a whole lot longer!",1379548800,5,287,4.433962264150943
8511861,5,B0077PBPDC,"This is a wonderful documentary, that is very much down to earth and gives you the feeling of being there. It's a couple with limited resources hiking this amazing river gorge for a year. There aren't arial shots or special filming techniques, but the simplicity of the documentary is what makes it so effective. The narrative was a bit offputting at the beginning, but I grew to enjoy it quite a bit. Yes they aren't trained voice over actors, but that's part of the down to earth vibe of this documentary. Really amazing work.",1376524800,2,528,4.627659574468085
