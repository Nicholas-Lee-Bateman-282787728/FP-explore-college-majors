8603151,5,B00EA9E7VU,This is a Great DVD. David Meng shows a clear approach to sculpting a dynamic  orangutang. Very thoughtful insight from artist including ideas on pose and great approach to building armature. Gnomon is putting out some fantastic product. The dvd was damaged but has no bearing on review.,1416787200,,287,4.979166666666667
