8430184,5,B004I6ECOW,Had this in DVD and wanted to have it in BluRay. Really like the story and the main female character. Very nice story indeed,1509926400,,124,4.208333333333333
8430185,4,B004I6ECOW,"Words cannot describe how happy I was to watch the live Kimi ni Todoke and was never disappointed on the whole of this love story of a horribly awkward girl suffering from serious social interaction issues to coming out of her shell and finding the courage to be normal. The actress who plays Sawako is absolutely adorable. Ayane is done very good and Chizuru is absolutely perfectly cast and acted. The downside is the guy who plays Shota, he's a little one dimensional.

I will repeat Ayane and Chizuru are absolutely perfect live action versions of their Anime counterparts.

The only other complaint I had was the ending kind of diverts from the Source Material but I won't spoil that for you. This is a wonderful adaptation and you cannot go wrong buying/watching it if you love this story.",1387843200,5,795,4.712230215827338
8430186,5,B004I6ECOW,"Semi spoiler that is evident from the first 5 minutes of the movie:  The idea of this movie is that the protagonist is a little awkward, but always strives to make others happy.  She gets the reputation of being a bad omen and is ostracized from her peers because of it.  When a boy takes notice of her, she begins to come out of her shell.  Watch as she learns that it is ok to have friends, be herself, and look for love.  My wife loved it, and I was surprised that I did as well.  It is a story that includes young love that seems realistic rather than over the top.",1371600000,4,569,4.035714285714286
