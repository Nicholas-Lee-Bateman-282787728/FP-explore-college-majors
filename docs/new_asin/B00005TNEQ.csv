1661683,5,B00005TNEQ,This movie was fantastic! One of the greatest families stories to date! The Hispanic community will benefit from this! This movie gives them diginity and grace beyond anything else. There is no actor that faltered in their part or character! I hope to see this in the Oscars in my book it deserves one! If you don't see this you are missing out!,999475200,,345,4.492063492063492
1661684,4,B00005TNEQ,"Entertaining and insightful but not as interesting nor revealing as Eat Drink Man Woman. The best, however, can be enjoyed if you rent the EDMW video first and then see this movie. It is absolutely intriguing to know the story and have images and story threads from EDMW and then superimpose on this story. Parts of each film are done better in their own story..But, together, the purist (only one language at at time, no changing recepies,etc)vs need for family acceptance is beautiful to watch and learn (from).",999475200,3,513,4.840909090909091
1661685,5,B00005TNEQ,"I went to see this film on a recommendation. Was I glad I went! What a wonderful cast, great story, and great cinematography especially during the food preparation scenes. I plan to acquire this film when it comes out on DVD. I want to see it a few more times. My wife and I came out of the theater dancing and mumbling some words from the famous song ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,"" or ""Quizas, Quizas, Quizas"" in Spanish. A feel good type of movie. Highly recommended!",999302400,,467,4.5058823529411764
1661686,4,B00005TNEQ,"The director, Maria Ripoll and the screenwriter, Vera Blasi had an uphill battle to say the least when they decided to adapt the incomparable Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" to the screen with their ""Tortilla Soup."" Martin Naranjo (Hector Elizondo) is a master chef, though semi-retired from the restaurant he created, and living with three daughters: Leticia (Elizabeth Pena), the oldest and a high school chemistry teacher, Carmen (Jacqueline Obrados), an MBA and very successful in business and Maribel, in high school and searching for the ""meaning of life"" as all teenagers should be doing. This film is very much like ""Soul Food"" in that most of the action revolves around the dinner table with luscious-looking food designed and prepared by the ""Hot Tamales"" of Food TV fame. And like Ang Lee's film all the daughters and their father are searching for love, happiness and contentment. Aren't we all? There is no violence except for a few dishes that get broken. In fact nothing much happens except we are made privy to several interesting people and watch as they conduct their lives in a rich, deep and fulfilling manner. Besides Elizondo who always does a great job, the standout performance has to be Jacqueline Obrados as Carmen. Keep your eyes open in the future as I'm sure we are going to see great things from her. An interesting note: Nikolai Kinski, grandson of the famous Klaus and son of the also famous Nastassia plays Maribel's boyfriend, Andy. That's three generations of Kinski's now in the movies and Nikolai makes a good impression in a basic no frills role. Food means love, sharing and camaraderie in ""Tortilla Soup,"" (Mexican characters) as it did in ""Soul Food""(African-American characters) and ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" (Taiwanese characters).  Maybe the United Nations should make note of this. You think?",999216000,32,1833,5.00983606557377
1661687,5,B00005TNEQ,"The title is a little tricky because it sounds really corny and silly. But what a delightful surprise watching the movie. There was humor, seriousness, tragedy, romance and all done in a fairly clean way which is very important to our family. Raquel Welch was very funny in the movie and we're not used to seeing her in a role such as this. Mr. Elizondo was fantastic. I loved Ms. Pena's role and just thoroughly enjoyed the movie and have been recommending it to everyone! I am mexican-american and my husband is white, and we both enjoyed it equally!!",998956800,2,553,4.595959595959596
1661688,5,B00005TNEQ,"As an Anglo, I was simply entertained. The casting was superb. The relationships developed by the screen play were believable. All five of the women in the story presented themselves with their own personna. Even the little girl who portrayed Sarah had a warmth beyond her years. I believe all audiences will enjoy this movie for what it is: a comedy based on a love story between a father and his daughters.",998870400,,408,4.680555555555555
1661689,5,B00005TNEQ,"Great movie, great acting. Hector Elizondo is better than ever and the three sisters are amazing. This is a movie to see more than one time. Beautiful story. Don't miss it.",998784000,2,172,4.580645161290323
1661690,5,B00005TNEQ,"This film is a good down to earth, feel good about yourself type of movie.  Martin the father played by Hector Elizondo has three daughters that live at home with him.  Hector once a chef that owned his own restaurant now cooks extravagant meals for his daughters and only wants them to be there for a traditional Sunday meal.  The oldest daughter is Leticia played by Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and she is a junior high school chemistry teacher that is confined by religion until she meets Paul Rodriquez the shcool's baseball coach.  The middle daughter Carmen played by Jacqueline Oradors wants to do everything for her father, but finally realizes that she needs to do what she loves to do.  The youngest daughter Maribel played by Tamara Mello is a young fiesty beutiful woman that works at a record store and wants to explorer the world after meeting a brazilian named Andy played by Nikolai Kinski instead of going off to college like what her fathers wants her to do.  To add some spice to the whole mixture there is Hortensia played by Raquel Welch but I do think that they dropped off the ""W"" in front of her name.  She goes ""Ga Ga"" over Martin and that is when everything goes bananas.  Tortilla Soup is good for this Chicano Soul.  If you like Mi Familia you will enjoy this film with no violence and a lot of laughs.",998006400,14,1324,4.529411764705882

1661815,5,B00005TNEQ,"Hector Elizondo ( Martin Naranjo) plays the part of a chef and father of three daughters. His 3 daughters Jacqueline Obradors (Carmen Naranjo)
Tamara Mello (Maribel Naranjo) and Elizabeth Pea (Leticia Naranjo) all declaring their independence all in different ways, that is difficult for their Mexican traditional father. There are lots of scenes where delicious food is being prepared and they are a delight to the eyes of someone like me who has a passion for cooking as well as professional chefs.
I loved when one of our favorite vixens of all time; Racqel Welch ( Hortensia) appears as the mother of a family's friend Constance Marie (Yolanda) who has her eye squarely on Hector. Predictably, the daughters are not too pleased about the situation. However, I will not give away the ending, you'll just have to watch this well written, talented filled movie for yourself! No matter what nationality you are, you can relate to this film.",1461801600,,940,4.955696202531645

1661826,5,B00005TNEQ,"My sister introduced me to this movie--and it has become one of my favorites!  I can relate to the three sisters' love-hate relationships (I have two sisters of my own), and, of course, the adorable Hector Elizondo stars in this as their dad.  It's a fresh, engaging look at a family (widowed dad and three daughters) in transition.  Also, the whole movie makes you want to cook fresh Mexican food.  Or maybe just go out and eat some.  When I received the DVD, it came with about six recipe cards--one of them being for ""Tortilla Soup"".  Worth making!  Listen to the soundtrack while making it, especially Bill Conti's title track, and the glorious Bebel Gilberto's classic Sem Contencao.  My favorite line:  ""Do you know why we clink glasses before drinking?... It's so that all the five senses are involved. We touch the glass. We take in the aroma. We see its color. We taste it. Hearing is the only sense that doesn't participate unless we create it.""",1454371200,,955,4.6706586826347305

She plays counter to a clueless but amiable Paul Rodriguez.  Hctor Elizondo, who has a career spanning fifty years, is excellent as the supportive single father.  Raquel Welch, as a single mother on the hunt, is hugely funny (and still real hot) and makes a play for Hector which is rebuffed and resolved by the end of the movie.

Back in a time when ethnically-themed stories were big (""Soul Food"" ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and so on), this was produced, featuring an amazing cast, from Raquelle Welch to Hector Elizondo. The footage of the cooking is as amazing as anything. The music will make you smile, and the story will enchant. The story is suitable for older kids, as there is mild sexuality. The story revolves around three sisters, a single mom they regard as family (and her mother, played by Welch), and their widowed father, a master chef. The youngest is looking for her destiny. The middle child is looking for something more than her career. The eldest is looking for love. And the father... you'll have to watch to find out! Made for Starz cable network, this movie could and should have been released in theaters.

Martin (Hector Elizondo) is a master chef with three daughters still living at home.

And oftentimes the news comes out during these dinners, interfering with Martin's sense of gustatory balance.

The widowed Martin is aggressively pursued by the mother of a friend.  This mother, played by none other than Raquel Welch, receives the biggest surprise of all as the story concludes.

1662102,5,B00005TNEQ,"This tremendously entertaining, funny, and enjoyable film is based on the original Ang Lee production, ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" which came out in 1994. While ""Tortilla Soup"" stays within the boundaries of the original screen play as written by Hui-Ling Want, Ang Lee, and James Schamus ... the differences are palpable and obvious. First, ""Tortilla Soup"" is set in California and the cultural background of the family is Mexican-American. Martin Naranjo (played to perfection by Hector Elizondo) is the retired chef and widowed father who chops, cooks, and creates the most magnificent, delicious, and spicey *Mexican* meals this side of the Rio Grande. He is the loving father of three adult daughters whom he single-handedly raised after his wife died fifteen years ago. Carmen, his oldest daughter who wanted to walk in her father's footsteps and become a chef but she ended up earning an M.B.A. in order to please him (secretly she loves to create new meals and dishes). Leticia (""Letty""), the middle daughter is more plain looking and a high school teacher whose subject is chemistry. She teaches at a public high school. Maribella, the youngest daughter is more modern and does not have a job yet. She has been accepted to the local University but is contemplating ""finding herself"" and discovering her interests .. especially after she meets Andr&eacute;, a handsome young Brazilian, living in a studio apartment, who seems to live a care-free existence in the USA.

Martin loves to prepare the weekly Sunday meal where the family tradition is to gather around the table and talk. Occasionally, Yolanda, a young lady next door and her school-aged daughter April join this family feast. Yolanda's mother Hortensia arrived to help while Yolanda's divorce is finalized. Raquel Welch plays Hortensia, the sexy mature siren who notices Martin's fine qualities. She attempts to endear herself to him through her feminine wiles. The story proceeds to show how Carmen plays the ultimate free-spirited career woman, who engages in fulfilling herself on many levels but is really dissatisfied and restless. Letty is a devoted teacher whose life seems unfulfilled, so she changed religions and joined a charismatic Christian church but seems doomed to remain a single ""old maid"". Maribella, the rebellious teenager dares to announce at one of the family dinners she wants to postpone college. She even shocks her boyfriend Andr&eacute; when she says her plans are to move in with him (they had not discussed this ahead of time).

Martin is called in to his former restaurant to fix a crisis because someone burned so much food, they don't know if the situation can be turned around to save the banquet. Luckily, he gets the bright idea to convert the burnt carmelized apples into a French dessert. The viewer is introduced to his good friend Gomez with whom he shares his personal feelings about life. Unfortunately, Gomez has health problems - and passes out in the kitchen of the restaurant. This situation gets Martin to think about his own health and to get his priorities in order. Carmen is contemplating moving to Barcelona, Spain to accept a dream job, even though she just bought a condo locally, with plans to live out on her own. Letty receives poetic cards left on her desk, believing they are from Orlanda Castillo, the new baseball coach at the high school. Marbella finds living with her boyfriend is not the ideal situation she had hoped it would be. All the subplots within the main story line develop unexpected twists and turns which hold the viewer's interest from start to finish. Even Martin pulls a huge surprise and makes a grand announcement at one of the family dinners, creating such a commotion that Hortensia faints. Unlike in the original film, Carmen makes one of her passionate dreams become reality. Letty's story unfolds pretty well as expected but with some new flairs and funny moments.  Marbella's teenage rebellion phase passes and luckily, Andr&eacute; comes around to seeing things her way. Overall, this is a great remake of the original, with unique embellishments and cultural differences to satisfy most viewers. I was very pleased to have discovered this film.

1662116,4,B00005TNEQ,"For those of you interested in seeing another notable food film, I reccomend TORTILLA SOUP. This is the Mexican-American update of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.  The story is the same, only the language, names and food have changed.  Yet, it still manages to workm though, purests will probably find plenty of room to criticize it for being a ""knock off.""  The story follows Martin Naranjo (Hector Elizondo), a widower who was once a legendary chef at a restaurant, but has since lost his ability to taste.  Martin lives with his three adult daughters, Letitia (Elizabeth Pena), Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors) and Maribel (Tamara Mello).  As the young women start to break away from family and start lives of their own, Sunday dinners are the one ritual that keeps them connected with their father, through his luscious meals.

This film is well-acted, though, I could have done without Raquel Welch in an overly melo-dramatic role, here.  She was just too shrill for my tastes, and not that entertaining.  The food scenes, on the other hand, will really draw you in.  Be sure to keep your finger on the dial to the best Mexican restaurant in your neighborhood, because you will be jonesing for some tlapana soup and chipotle when it's all through!",1181606400,6,1237,4.852380952380952

1662118,5,B00005TNEQ,"This is a high-spirited version of ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" set in East LA, with enough footage in the kitchen to rank it among the better shows on the Food Channel (Santa Monica's Border Grill gets a credit). The cooking is all Mexican, and the family that gathers around the table to enjoy it, while squabbling all the while, is Mexican-American - a widowed father and his three grown daughters. Meanwhile, the presence or absence of romantic partners is a common topic of discussion and a prime motivator of most of the action in the film, so that cooking, eating and love in its many forms become all part of what draws and holds everyone together.

It's definitely a feel-good movie that sidesteps just about every inconvenient fact of life for Mexican-Americans living in Los Angeles. The music track is upbeat and joyous, and characters have a way of breaking into song, singing Spanglish versions of ""Quizas, Perhaps, Quizas."" Hector Elizondo is wonderful as the rock-steady father of this clan, and Elizabeth Pea as his born-again unmarried daughter is all barely contained passion seething beneath a pious exterior. In noteworthy supporting roles, Raquel Welch gets to raise temperatures as an overbearing oft-wed neighbor on the prowl for another mate, and Julio Oscar Mechoso turns in an endearing performance as an assistant chef and close friend of the family.

1662122,4,B00005TNEQ,"Hector Elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill.  Aside from his superlative work as a Doctor on ""Chicago Hope"" he has been often cast as a sideman in films - the trusted aide, the sympathetic boss - but often in supporting roles.  In ""Tortilla Soup"" he takes the leading role in a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eat-Drink-Man-Woman/dp/B00005JKG1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eat Drink Man Woman</a>.

He plays Martin Naranjo, a Mexican Chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist.  The movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared, then eaten, that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen.  Martin is has lost much of his sense of taste, which he thinks is a cruel irony, but his Cuban partner reminds him that Beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing.  Martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago.  Elizabeth Pena is Leticia, the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple ""grace"" into mini-sermons.  Jacqueline Obradors is the saucy Carmen, who was encouraged to get her MBA by Martin, but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking.  Tamara Mello is the youngest Maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to ""find herself"".  Constance Marie is family friend Yolando, who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who Martin dotes on.  Raquel Welch is Yolando's mother, Hortensia, who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished Martin.

The film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions.  At the beginning of the film all of the characters are single.  By the end they've all been paired off in one manner or another, some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others.  Raquel Welch is a bit of a distraction in the film.  At age 61 she has a show-stopping beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25.  In a film full of attractive performers she doesn't ""look her age"" enough to blend into the story.  She plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester.

The movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and I would recommend it if only to watch Hector Elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen.",1139356800,12,2840,4.978813559322034

I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman.",1089417600,23,588,4.444444444444445

This is a beautiful movie about family, losing the ones we love, having to deal with living a life of your own, love, heartbreak, everything that we deal with in our everyday lives.

And there's not a single weak link in the cast.  AND.. if you are at ALL a 'foodie'... you owe it to yourself to add this flick to your library.  Gads, the knife technique alone is worth it.

Set in some Mexican part of LA, this is a movie about, of course, food. But just bubbling under the comic surface are half a dozen more sombre themes involving how food brings us together and how it changes in tune with culture, sibling rivalry, personal freedom, ambition etc etc.
Yet, the execution is thankfully sunny and quick so it never gets ho-hum. If nothing else, I bet it'll make you crave for some Mexican food. Highly recommend taking a sip of this one.",1074124800,15,653,4.5423728813559325

1662150,4,B00005TNEQ,"The quality of the acting in this film is superior to the material. Given the number of situation comedies on television which have come and gone during the past 20 years, it has become increasingly more difficult to produce an original film which involves a single parent struggling to raise several children. Ably directed by Maria Ripoll, Tortilla Soup focuses on Martin Naranjo (Hector Elizondo), a renowned chef who is slowly losing his senses of taste and smell as well as control of the lives of three daughters: schoolteacher Letitia (Elizabeth Pena), management consultant Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors), and teenager Maribel (Tamara Mello). This is a ""cute,"" at times endearing film and I enjoyed it. Raquel Welch's performance as Hortentia, mother of another single parent and herself on the prowl for a new husband, brings energy as well as humor to her role. I was soon intrigued by the differences between and among the three daughters. They create all manner of opportunities for plot and character developments which, alas, the screenplay fails to provide. Various loose ends are all tied up pleasantly but too neatly by the film's conclusion.

as another reviewer commented, this film also lacks the subtlety and quality of acting as eat drink man woman. the delicate relationship the daughters have with each other as well as with their father is the focus of both movies, but is portrayed rather tritely in tortilla soup. all in all, this movie could have been decent, but after seeing the original, it just does not compare.",1029542400,18,948,4.549707602339181

It was wonderful seeing Hector Elizonda in a leading role as Martin, a former chef who has lost his senses of taste and smell. He is a wonderful actor, and  the three actresses who played his daughters who still live at home did a good job too. Raquel Welsh was a bit ""out there"" but was not on the screen that much.
Martin prepares incredibly elaborate meals...but now just for his daughters and an occasional guest. He is old-fashioned and very proud and thinks he is still taking care of his grown daughters....except that they think they are taking care of him! Despite his efforts to control the lives of those under his roof, each of the girls has her own ideas about the future.

I want to be entertained when I go to a movie, not be depressed or disturbed by what I have seen.  This is a feel-good movie, light and entertaining.  Hector Elizondo is great as usual, as a chef and widowed father of 3 daughters, each of them yearning to spread their wings and yet feeling tied to home and tradition. The respect and love they each have for their father is apparent, and delightful. The family dinners and conversation that takes place at the table is a focal point of the movie. I especially enjoyed the performances of Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a (eldest daughter, Leticia) and Paul Rodriguez as her love interest.  They were such fun to watch.  Raquel Welch's performance as well was spicy and delightful, as the sexy divorcee pursuing Elizondo, much to the dismay of his daughters.  The food looked mouth watering, and in itself is worth seeing the movie for. This movie has a PG-13 rating but only because of sexual innuendos in the beginning between one of the daughters and her lover, but nothing graphic is shown, and there is no bad language.

1662185,3,B00005TNEQ,"Why is it that food, any food, can look so much better on the big screen? And why is it that films where one of the major supporting roles lives in a pot or a pan can'tquite get a hold of reality? Take two recent films: Lasse Hallestrom's Chocolat and Maria Ripoll's Tortilla Soup.
While these two films vary greatly in subject matter, they have one thing in common: those scrumptious performances by delectable dishes. Each one used them to make the whole more lively, as metaphors or just to excite the audience's taste buds. Chocolat was a fantasy of sorts so it was allowed to get away with it. Tortilla Soup is a spicy yet often-stale film that at times seems more like a cooking show than a family comedy.
Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors), Leticia (Elizabeth Pena) and Maribel (Tamara Mello) are three sisters living with their father Martin Naranjo (Hector Elizondo). Tradition is stunting the sister's growth, keeping them all in while what they really want to do is move out and become their own. Hector, however, is having his own problems. He is an excellent chef, praised by his friends to be one of the best in the world, yet his taste is failing him.
Sitting on Tortilla Soup's shoulders are an angel and a devil. The angel is telling the film to go ahead and be whatever it needs to be. The angel starts off the film, giving us a cast of characters that will engage us and make us wonder just where the film is going to go. The angel also gives us some well-earned, honest laughs. Almost every little ""confession"" at the dinner table brings about a bittersweet chuckle.
Hector Elizondo is a perfect fatherly figure for the three girls who are only just starting to branch off into the world. It is he who keeps the film rolling, who keeps it tight keeps it on course as long as he can. However, the devil on the other shoulder is tricky.
This devil is clinging to formula. He does not want to see his precious little film escape from his clutches, so he makes sure that it will stay in la-la-land and never really get off of the ground.
All in all, Tortilla Soup is fair romantic/family content that can never overcome it's own self-importance. It entertains for a while, then bids the world adieu as it spins off into a fantasy land that the filmmakers think everybody loves. Its hot-headed screenplay got to me. Watch Tortilla Soup for some lighthearted entertainment, but watch out if you can't stand being cheated for a happy ending.",1018656000,,2448,4.5659090909090905

Some performers, especially Elizabeth Pena and Racquel Welch, do good work here, but the material is rather light. The film does manage to stand as one of the few American films that manages not to rely on violence to further its plot. I would reccomend ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" or ""What's Cooking"" before this film though, as those films are better and feature better food photography (this film's shot on digital video & looks somewhat washed out).",1000339200,4,654,5.121495327102804
