2225121,4,B0007OY2MG,Used as a total escape into that leave it to Beaver type of world that probably never existed and all of us want to step into now and then.  Where everyone really has a heart of gold and means well for each other and things inevitably work out for the best in the end.  Like pablum and a warm blanket for the brain.

2225219,1,B0007OY2MG,"Wife ordered this one.  This is the worst show ever created, but for some reason, females love it.

I have pinned it down to a sole reason.  Bad acting aside, it is the temp of the script.  They answer or respond to questions almost before the other character has ended speaking.  I mean, if the people in Stars Hollow are telepathic, then I think they should state that somewhere in the 153 episodes.

Alas, I do not think they are telepathic, but just bad acting, bad script writing, and an all around headache of a show.",1417392000,,523,4.395833333333333

The dialogue and chemistry between Lorelei and Rory is great. You really get the feeling they are mother and daughter. I also really enjoy their interactions with Emily and Richard. You can really feel the emotional turmoil between Lore and Emily. Now add into the mix the supporting characters from the small town they live in and it is an AMZING show. I love Luke, Sookie, Patty, Kurt, and even Taylor at times. I also love that this is a family show your entire family can enjoy. Just beware you might pick up a coffee addiction watching them drink so much coffee.",1412812800,,713,4.450381679389313

2225318,5,B0007OY2MG,"My daughter and I watched all 7 seasons of the Gilmore Girls during her teenage years and loved it! Not only was it another way for us to bond, but it covered so many of the challenges that teenagers go through, from friends, to boyfriends, to preparing for and choosing a college. By the time my daughter was applying to colleges, we knew what to expect (and we were looking for that large envelope in the mail, which we got, and unfortunately which they no longer doit's all my email now). It's a great, wholesome series that I highly recommend every mom watch with her daughters. It offers plenty of opportunities for discussion of situations they may encounter in their own lives.

There is not a moment you won't laugh when he's in a scene and Michel is second running on that.

2225425,4,B0007OY2MG,"Actually, my wife is the one who loves this (however, I really like it, too). She had fond memories of this one back in college (I think it was then) and talked about those days enough for me to move forward with these. Every season only pushes her forward that much quickly (she knocks these out in a few nights). Season three is nearly the best of the series (following only season one for greatness), after a bit of a dip in the second season, with Rory starting to move on with her life, as her time at Chilton comes to a close. This is by far some of her best moments (outside of the real drama in season six). One of the series' best episodes, ""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"", is here and ""That'll Do Pig"" is a good one, too (always thought Marion Ross' ""Trix"" and Dean's sister, Clara, were good comedy relief). A dramatic turn in Lorelai & Sookie's Independence-Dragonfly Inn situation occurs and Rory's college plans ... may not be Harvard???",1358208000,,954,4.457142857142857

2225446,1,B0007OY2MG,"The show started out a little cute . . . a little annoying . . . . But by this season it totally gave into the dark side. It became another liberal propaganda show. There were lines about ""dictators who own ranches in Texas"" . . . . There were lines about how great and fabulous Hillary Clinton is . . . what a ""role model"" she is. There were episodes about how ""silly"" mothers of teenagers are who have an issue with LauraLai talking about her pregnancy to them in a school class speech. There is the entire kids sleeping and having their ""firsts"", done with casualty. There were episodes where LauraLai says ""OK Now I believe everything Bush thinks."" And of course the stream of guys floating in and out of these two women's lives and beds gets faster. It was just the decline of a show that was pretty entertaining to begin with.",1335916800,3,832,4.339743589743589

That episode has the eldest Lorelai, Rory's great grandmother, played by Happy Days' Marion Ross. Watching the relationship between her and Emily is hysterical. This season also has way more Jess and a lot less Dean which is a major plus for girls who like the bad boys.",1325462400,,355,4.650793650793651

Thankfully when I opened it up the discs were intact but the plastic that holds all the discs together like a hinge was broken. I don't know if this is an amazon problem or a WB problem but it was disappointing all the same.,1325116800,2,396,4.293333333333333

2225466,5,B0007OY2MG,"Season Three of the Gilmore Girls is one of the best of all seven seasons. In this season, Rory [Alexis Bledel] is in her final year at Chilton private school and faces some of the most trying times, be it manouvering political games within the student body, or the love triangle between her, Dean [Jared Padalecki] and Jess [Milo Ventimiglia]. Alexis Bledel does a wonderful job in this season and truly shows her maturing as an actress.

Of course, Lorelai [Lauren Graham] continues to shine in her role as a single mom, best friend to her daughter, and aspiring inn owner. Lorelai, fresh from the romantic disappointments of the previous two seasons finds herself sort of lost, and dates around, never truly finding a soulmate. Diner owner Luke Danes [Scott Patterson] is always there to lend his unwavering support and of course, Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is simply magical to watch, be it as good friends or as two people slowly being drawn towards each other.

The rocky relations between Lorelai and her parents Emily and Richard Gilmore [ Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann] goes through its usual turbulent times and its always entertaining to see Lorelai in action and putting her parents in their place, despite their overbearing attitude. Kelly Bishop's Emily is truly a delight to watch as she plays the snooty, controlling character to perfection.

Amidst the changes in the main characters' lives this season, the most significant ones are the Rory-Jess-Dean love triangle, and for once we see Rory getting out of her goody-two-shoes character by going after Jess despite being Dean's girlfriend and the episode ""They Shoot Gilmores Don't They"" shows the resolution to this. There is also the college application anxiety, is it going to be Harvard or Yale?

Lorelai's dreams of opening her own inn are developed in greater detail this season, as we see her working hard towards achieving that dream, especially with a certain event that acts as a catalyst towards that end. All in all, I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course. A must-watch series!",1320019200,3,2102,4.929378531073446
2225477,5,B0007OY2MG,"I love Gilmore Girls and the witty dialect that contains various cultural references. It's a great entertainment TV series and addresses issues that most teenage girls and students in general must deal with in high school. As always, the relationship between Lorelai and her daughter Rory is portrayed as open and honest, an ideal relationship that rarely exists! Love the series and would definitely recommend the DVD set to own for everyone who feels the same way.",1317859200,,466,5.064935064935065

As with many of life's great changes, there are points of closure and this, for me, is one of them. If the series had ended here, I would not have been unhappy. Everything wraps up nicely as Rory finishes high school and closes this chapter of her life.

Of course, there are questions that still remain, but life generally does that. :D

I do have the next seasons ready to watch, but will give myself a breather to do a few other things in my life, as I am comfortable leaving it ""here"" for now.",1296777600,2,587,4.4672897196261685

Rory shows her academic smarts but isn't too good at picking guys to fall in love with, while Lorelai and Luke seem to be edging closer to each other.  In the meantime, the inn burns severely, leaving Lorelai and the hilarious, high-strung Sookie to hatch plans for a new place that they can manage together.

The one character I find tragic is Lane Kim, who is musically gifted and spirited, but this spirit is crushed by her overly strict mother.",1264204800,,690,4.931034482758621

2225564,5,B0007OY2MG,"Season Three of the Gilmore Girls is one of the best of all seven seasons. In this season, Rory [Alexis Bledel] is in her final year at Chilton private school and faces some of the most trying times, be it manouvering political games within the student body, or the love triangle between her, Dean [Jared Padalecki] and Jess [Milo Ventimiglia]. Alexis Bledel does a wonderful job in this season and truly shows her maturing as an actress.

Of course, Lorelai [Lauren Graham] continues to shine in her role as a single mom, best friend to her daughter, and aspiring inn owner. Lorelai, fresh from the romantic disappointments of the previous two seasons finds herself sort of lost, and dates around, never truly finding a soulmate. Diner owner Luke Danes [Scott Patterson] is always there to lend his unwavering support and of course, Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is simply magical to watch, be it as good friends or as two people slowly being drawn towards each other.

The rocky relations between Lorelai and her parents Emily and Richard Gilmore [ Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann] goes through its usual turbulent times and its always entertaining to see Lorelai in action and putting her parents in their place, despite their overbearing attitude. Kelly Bishop's Emily is truly a delight to watch as she plays the snooty, controlling character to perfection.

Amidst the changes in the main characters' lives this season, the most significant ones are the Rory-Jess-Dean love triangle, and for once we see Rory getting out of her goody-two-shoes character by going after Jess despite being Dean's girlfriend and the episode ""They Shoot Gilmores Don't They"" shows the resolution to this. There is also the college application anxiety, is it going to be Harvard or Yale?

Lorelai's dreams of opening her own inn are developed in greater detail this season, as we see her working hard towards achieving that dream, especially with a certain event that acts as a catalyst towards that end.

All in all, I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course. A must-watch series!",1196208000,,2103,4.929378531073446

2225591,5,B0007OY2MG,"Plenty of momentous developments in the lives of Lorelei and Rory Gilmore (Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel) occur in the third season of this excellent program that combines a family soap opera set in a town of eccentrics with the wise-cracking sensibility of a screwball comedy from the 40s.  Lorelei and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) are forced to speed up their plans to open their own inn due to unforseen events at the Independence, though not without severe complications.  The most important arc of the season concerned Rory's senior year at Chilton and her choice of college.  The road to that decision is fraught with complications and wonderful character moments, and Rory's graduation is quite touching.  At first, I didn't care for the addition of Rory's new bad boy paramour Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), but he grew on me after a while.  Giving Luke (Scott Patterson) a strong male to butt heads with in his capacity as guardian further revealed his character's strength and decency, while his unfamiliarity with the role brought out a vulnerability.  Lorelei's parenting tips provided some of the best moments of the season.  Their enigmatic exchange in the final episode indicates that things may be heating up in their future.

2225595,5,B0007OY2MG,"Having literally grown up together, 18-year-old Rory Gilmore and her 34-year-old mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.

In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.

Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.

Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.

In this season, Rory fights an attraction to Luke's bad-boy nephew Jess...til things come to a point where she has to make a decision between him and Dean, her first serious boyfriend. She and her best friend Paris are also consumed with college applications, while Rory's stepmother Sherry gives birth to little Gigi.

Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)",1175299200,,2473,5.141791044776119

While I liked the season, I felt a few things were overdone. I was a bit bored by Kirk. Yeah we get it. He's clumsy, anti-social and a loser. But the slapstick comedy got a little old.

Also, the elder Lorelai and her selfish antagonism and refusal to 'bury the hatchet' with her parents got a bit boring. I like Lorelai's parents...They've been exceedingly generous with both their daughter and grandchild and at times Lorelai's attitude towards them bugs me.

2225647,5,B0007OY2MG,"the show had survived two seasons and gaining viewers as it went. but unlike the previous two seasons we notice something in the girls and everyone else that we had never seen before. during the season opener we watched lorelei's strange dream about being married and having a baby with luke that confused us as much as it did her. we watched as lorelei finally decided to take the plunge and start her own bussiness with her best friend sookie. we watch rory swept up in the quest of getting into the perfect college (under the influence of her grandparents of course). and then we have the men who line the gilmore girl's lives and those of their friends. such as luke as we see him dating a cute and funny lawyer working for taylor. there is dean who in a moment of frustration breaks up with rory and months later begins dating (and proposing to) a sweet blonde named lindsey. there is jess, luke's bad-boy nephew, who begins dating rory and making her life more confusing than it has ever been( not that his life makes any sense either). and then we have the cute newcomer dave who not only asks lane to join his band but also asks her to prom which she excitedly agreed to both.

but much is learned in this season too. after a fire strikes the inn lorelei learns that she can run a bussiness and that maybe she really is ready to start her own inn. rory learns that realationships aren't always easy and that she will realationships that aren't lined with roses. so as we leave the girls at the end of the season one about to learn about starting a bussiness, the other about college life, we know that these girls are closer than ever.",1141516800,4,1643,4.404605263157895
2225648,5,B0007OY2MG,"The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.

When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.

It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.

The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",1141430400,5,1946,4.807807807807808
2225649,5,B0007OY2MG,"That's right, I'm a guy. And I like this show. For the record, let me state that I didn't always like it, in fact, I honestly despised the show. But my wife loves it, and being whipped as most guys who wear the handcuff that is a wedding ring are I bought it for her for xmas, starting with season 1. Somehow she convinced me to watch the first few episodes with her, and I found I wasn't miserable. Every time before when she had turned the show on while it was on TV I grapped my laptop and headphones and watched some DVD with blood, gore, and explosions, as any normal guy would. But watching the show from the beginning actually got interesting. I found myself getting pissed off when Dean breaks up with Rory, and later on when... actually, no spoilers, lets just say a perfect relationship gets screwed up by the wrong person getting pregnant. So, for all you guys who hate all the luvy-dubby TV shows that your wife or girlfriend undoubtedly try to get you to watch, I'm telling you, buy this show, STARTING WITH SEASON 1. I can't stress that enough, if you start in the middle of the series you will find it to be crap and hate it and me for writing this review, and I really don't want anyone to blame me for taking any time out of their lives. But if you buy it, your significant other will thank you and be amazed as you actually sit through an entire chick show with her without wanting to stab your eyes out from sheer boredom.

2225714,5,B0007OY2MG,"For the third season in a row, THE GILMORE GIRLS excelled as the show in which absolutely nothing happened and yet in which everything happened. The show at times seems like the work of illusionists. The main plot of one early season episode? Lorelai is asked to water the yard of a new neighbor. Not a lot of seeming potential in that, and in fact there is minimal exploitation of the situation. The tone of the show is definitely that of a comedy, yet it is never a situational one. If you could time warp the writers of I LOVE LUCY into the future to see the show, they would be baffled.

As always, the show is driven by the great dialogue and talk, but it is also structured around a number of long-to-resolve issues. Will Rory get into Harvard? Will she go there? Will Rory end up with Dean or Jess? Will Lorelai end up with anyone? Will Lorelai and Sookie get their inn? All of these questions get answered, not always in the ways that we anticipated. But this is one of those shows where what happens is of interest only because we like and care about the characters. ""What will happen next?"" is not a question that tortures the viewers of the show. 24 and THE GILMORE GIRLS inhabit different television universes.

By Season Three we have come to love all the ritualistic aspects of the show. Ritual has always played a crucial role in great comedy, from the always-repeating antics of Laurel and Hardy to the never-ending adventures of the Roadrunner and Coyote to Kenny's tendency to die over and over. On THE GILMORE GIRLS we have grown to anticipate a new maid each week at the Gilmore residence in Hartford. And a new crusade by Taylor, as well as a new occupation or obsession by Kirk each week. Structurally, things like these are necessities on a show such as this one that is not driven by plot.

While I thoroughly love the show, I do have to utter a couple of words of complaint. As someone who got a graduate degree at Yale (and therefore lack somewhat the love that undergraduates feel for their alma maters), and decided to go to Yale over Harvard, I was always perplexed by the Harvard mono-mania. The folks I knew at Yale always considered Yale to be the better school, though most of us would have swapped New Haven for Cambridge. But I want to object to a couple of other details that were a tad off. First, in ""Let the Games Begin"" they visit ""Yale,"" which was apparently a public park in California in which they put a fake ""Yale University"" sign to make the unsuspecting imagine that Yale might look like that. In fact, the fictional Yale bears utterly no resemblance to the actual Yale. There were statues on this campus, and although my memory could be playing tricks, I can recall no statues on campus apart from the very famous one of Nathan Hale (of which imitations exist in front of the Chicago Tribune Building on North Michigan Avenue and in front of the CIA Headquarters, which was largely founded by Yale graduates--well, Skull and Bones members to be even more precise) that stands in front of Connecticut Hall, where I used to take philosophy classes. Also, a good deal of the plot at one part turns on Rory getting a financial aid offer a few months after getting into Yale. Anyone who has gotten into a major university knows that financial aid offers almost always arrive at the time of the admission offer.

Still, carping aside, another great season. I'd like to point out as I have in previous reviews that several people have told me how Lorelai and Rory remind them of my daughter and me. But the imp in me has to point out that my daughter's SATs were much higher than Rory's :) Anyone thinking such parental boasting inappropriate need only think of the season finale, where Lorelai intentionally goes hunting for Rory, asking for her daughter the class valedictorian. The end of the year, however, clearly marks a transition point.

2225715,5,B0007OY2MG,"The focus of the season is the transition of Rory to college and how the people around her are going to deal with it (by people I mean Lorelei) as there were episodes allotted the college application, admission letters, graduation, tuition fees etc. And then of course the Dean-Rory-Jess triangle resurfaced. Rory and Paris also became an unlikely best friends.

Some of the best episodes are

-Those Lazy, Crazy, Hazy Days (season 3 premiere)

-They Shoot Gilmore, Don't They (just a perfect episode, the comedy, the ensemble, the ending)

-A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving (another classic Emily-Richard-Lorelei-Rory fight in the dinner)

-I Solemnly Swear (A nice Paris-Rory episode as the relationship showed signs of depth after all)

-Swan Song (Emily and Jess in one room, you get the picture)

-The Big One (Liza Weil stole this episode. This is an important episode for Paris and Liza Weil nailed it. She was heartbreaking, funny, cute you name it)

-Happy Birthday Baby (cute opening scene and Emily strikes back again. I love it)

-Those are Strings Pinocchio (another triumphant finale, how can you not cry with Rory's graduation speech)

2225716,5,B0007OY2MG,"""Gilmore Girls"" is pure fun - the wittiest dialogue, the best written comic situations, acted by stellar turns from Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Scott Patterson and the ensemble cast. Although it is labelled ""family entertainment"" it is far from being bland or boring but instead offers an insightful look at family dynamics and does so in a most entertaining way. Season Three develops the characters even more and puts them in new circumstances and forces them to make decisions that will change their lives forever. Can't wait for Season Four!",1122508800,3,547,5.088888888888889
2225717,5,B0007OY2MG,"Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...

Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...

The Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere ""Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days"" in which everyone's relationship is a source for debate. Rory and Lorelai discuss the merits of Jess versus Dean, while Lorelai's parents debate her relationship with Christopher. Meanwhile, Sookie and Jackson argue over the proper way to decorate their house... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving"" in which Lorelai and Rory eat four different Thanksgiving dinners (including a tofu turkey!), and ""Happy Birthday, Baby"" in which Lorelai's parents are ecstatic to learn of Rory's decision to attend Yale, but Emily is angry with Richard when Lorelai pays off their loan because she thinks it will mean the end of her relationship with Lorelai and Rory...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD:

The only episode I didn't like was Here Comes the Son (the one that focused on Jess to promote his spinoff that never happened.) I really enjoyed the Thanksgiving episode!

I, for one, love the quick pace of the show and the witty banter. I think that's what makes the show so interesting. And it was said in the first season DVD extras that they talk so fast because their scripts are so much longer than the average tv show.

It's light and fun, yet deep enough to make you think about certain issues; especially those involving family; and even more specifically in the mother/daughter relationship.  We see how great this relationship can be in the Lorelei/Rory pairing; and how difficult and complex in the Emily/Lorelei one.

This said, I find that the show needs to finetune some elements:

1.  I agree with the previous reviewer who comments that no one in real life speaks so quickly.  In reference to Lorelei, I would also add, no one in real life speaks with so many wordplays, pop culture, and literary references and at such speaking speeds.  It's more than a bit unrealistic.  I would have to agree with Luke saying that Lorelei can be obnoxious, I feel like finding her ""off"" button many times.

Well, I don't have to write about how great and funny ""Gilmore Girls"" is. Others have done that already.

Anyway,back to my review. I love this season as the previous. I still can't believe they haven't added a commentary or some sort for some episodes like some other movies or series. I'm a little bit disappointed.
A nice bonus/extras on the actors comments on their childhood,short but cute.
I like the part where Kirk shows some dance moves.
One addition I like to see in the future's dvds besides the commentary from the actors and director is adding the Stars Hollow map where the viewer can have a virtual visit to this beloved town.

2225780,5,B0007OY2MG,"I have been a Gilmore Girls addict since the first time I watched an episode in the first season.  I've been buying them on DVD as they've come out.  Third season has just as much wit and great conversation (at very high speeds) as the first two, and just as many obscure references (fortunately, it comes with a handy guide to ""Gilmore-isms""). The quality of the show has not diminshed, but has grown stronger.

Third season also has many of the references to Seventh-day Adventists, which totally cracks me up, as I have grown up in an SDA family.  And for anyone who cares, Seventh-day Adventist colleges do allow gum chewing and bowling, and guys and girls are now allowed to eat together and walk on the same sidewalks--though this was not always the case.  However, as a student at an SDA college, I've made my fair share of jokes about the conservative nature of my school.  So despite the errors in their facts, the jokes on Adventists are pretty funny to me.  There is one thing that bothers me: if Lane knew anything about Adventists, she would not pronounce it Ad-VEN-tist.  Every true Adventist pronounces it AD-ven-tist.  It's a dead giveaway of a poser.",1115942400,4,1167,4.6536585365853655

2225783,5,B0007OY2MG,"The third season of ""Gilmore Girls"" offers a lot of ups and down for Lorelai and Rory, not to mention pretty much everybody else at Stars Hollow or Chilton.  I was prepared to declare that this was my least favorite season of the series because I did not like Jess and I though Rory's choice to ditch Dean for Jess was the lost of the innocence that made the character so endearing in the first place.  Then I took into account that ""Gilmore Girls"" airs on the WB and from Felicity choosing Ben over Noel and Joey picking Pacey over Dawson I have been nothing but disappointed with the romantic choices of their ingnues.  Buffy chose Angel and then she ended up killing him.  If Lorelai and Luke do not end up happily ever after I might be compelled to give up on the show (consider this fair warning, WB), but if Rory could dump Dean I knew Jess could never go the distance and I could take heart in that fact.

What defines this third season for Lorelai and Rory are not the men (or boys) in their lives but rather their goals of realizing their dreams.  For Lorelai this means opening up her own inn with Sookie.  That dream gets put on the front burner when a fire damages the Independence Inn (""A Tale of Poes and Fire""), but buying the Dragonfly Inn (the house from ""The Waltons"" if you know your television history) proves to be a problem (""Say Goodnight, Gracie"").  When Lorelai insists on spending the money she got from her father on her daughter's education at Yale it is Rory who has to cut her own deal with Richard and Emily so that her mother can get her dream too (""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio"").  It is supposedly a ""win-win-win"" situation, but that remains to be seen.

Of course, Rory getting into the college of her dreams is the real defining element of the season.  I came to the show late (mea culpa, mea maxima culpa) so I knew that Rory was at Yale and wondered what on earth had happened to keep her from going to Harvard.  Well, in Season 3 we find out.  The dream starts to turn into a nightmare when Rory's application for Harvard has to be put together (""Application Anxiety"").  When Paris did not get into Harvard (""The Big One""), I was terrified the same fate awaited Rory.  But when Richard manipulates Rory into an interview at Yale (""Let the Games Begin"") my biggest surprise was that Lorelai was actually wrong in an argument with her father (the end of the episode indicates she knows that too).  This one has two of Rory's best moments in this season are when she tells Richard he did the right thing the wrong way in this episode and when she apologizes to Dean and I could feel she was still a good kid at heart.  I also like it in the season finale when she tells Emily she is being stupid in shutting out Lorelai and if I could use my one free spin in this life to get Rory to say something it would be to tell Emily, ""Grandma, I love you, but no matter what you do I will never love you more than I love my mother.""

The best part of Rory and Jess was Lorelai giving Luke lessons on what it means to be a parent of a teenager in love.  Other big moments are the dance marathon (""They Shoot Gilmores Don't They?""), the poignant flashback's to the pregnant young Lorelai (""Dear Emily and Richard""), and Emily standing up to Trix (""That'll Do, Pig"").  For me the funniest moment of the entire season is in ""I Solemnly Swear"" when Emily reads the transcript of Lorelai's deposition.  I almost busted a gut on that one.  Yes, I cried when Rory talked about her mom in her graduation speech, but the sweetest moment of the season was when they came up with the great payoff for the running gag about the t-shirts Kirk was selling at the end of ""A Tale of Poes and Fire"" (Admit it: You wish you have a ""Rory's Going to Yale"" t-shirt).  Now we can send Rory off to college in Season 4 so that Luke and Lorelai can finally get on the same page and kiss already.

The DVD offers up extra scenes, which is certainly ample justification for fans of the show to check it out in this format.  Besides, if you have waiting to see baby pictures of Lauren Graham or Alexis Bledel, Liz Torres and Kelly Bishop in their dancing days, or having a burning desire to see Sean Gunn do the robot again, then the featurettes on the childhood stories from the cast and their best 1980s dance moves are going to allow you to move on to having other images on your visual wish list.",1115424000,67,4398,4.308252427184466
2225784,5,B0007OY2MG,"SO. When does season 4 come out on DVD???

I think disk 4 and 5 on Season 3 are my favorite ones.",1115337600,,97,3.409090909090909
2225785,5,B0007OY2MG,"The third season of ""Gilmore Girls"" is probably the most perfectly realized year of the series yet released on DVD.  Okay, Lorelai (the amazing and totally hot Lauren Graham) maybe isn't as prominently featured as we would like, but her relationship with Luke keeps deepening in preparation for its full flowering this year in season 5.  Season 3 has lots of action for Rory (the terrific Alexis Bledel): academic pressure during her senior year at Chilton; first friends, then enemies, then friends again with the hilariously nasty Paris (the great Liza Weil) and her airhead flunkies Madeline and Louise; the traumatic dance-marathon break-up with Dean and subsequent stormy relationship with that little punk Jess.

The season kicks off with probably my favorite two Gilmore moments, at the beginning and at the end of the episode ""Those Lazy-Crazy-Hazy Days"":  Lorelai's dream that she is pregnant with Luke's twins, and their reconciliation in a deserted Luke's diner at the climax.  These two scenes, with their splendid blend of wise-ass humor and genuine emotion, are typical of what makes this series so special.

Rory also finds herself more and more attracted to Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and drifting away from her first love Dean (Jared Padalecki) which comes to a dramatic conclusion in the ""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"" episode.  The season opens with Lorelei dreaming she is married to Luke (Scott Patterson) and is pregnant with twins.  She is confused about her feelings toward him especially when he starts dating a young attorney Nicole (Tricia O'Kelley).  The season also finds Rory making a surprise choice (much to Lorelei's dismay) about college and the Independence Inn having a major fire.

When the first two seasons came out, we had Gilmore Girls marathon nights, and I am so excited about doing that again with the third season.  In this season, we see the ""girls"" grow a little as their personalities develop more and more. The supporting cast also shines. The Palladino's really capture the Gen-Xer's struggle with rebellion against the overjudgement of the baby-boomer generation while still trying to be a good parent and have functional relationships. They also capture the pop-culture obsession of the Gen-X '80s childhood. I truly identify with the ""girls,"" and the lack-of-soap-opera style of the Gilmore Girls is so refreshing in this tv era.

The banter is quick, like players on a ping pong table. My issue is this....no one actually speaks this way. I don't know a single soul, let alone two people, who are capable of interchanges like this. The series often borders on being overwritten, even if the writing is what makes it great.

Obviously I haven't seen this set yet as it's not out, but I've seen all of season three more than once and will still go buy this as soon as it comes out!",1110499200,10,417,4.428571428571429

2225869,5,B0007OY2MG,"I don't know what it is about the third seasons of my all time favorite television shows. Their third years always seem to be one of their best, if not THE best, season of the series. And this one is no exception. By this time, Gilmore Girls has grown to be one of the more accomplished, sophisticated, witty, clever, and intelligent pieces of work on television. I am constantly amazed with every episode with the magnitude of clever writing, humor, and top of the line acting. Amy Sherman-Palladino is a writer/director of immense talent, and I am still thrilled to this day that she has given us the wonderful gift of the girls. Season 3 is, in my opinion, the best season of the show yet. Filled with the colorful characters and stories that have cemented the series' reputation, season 3 delivers in all areas. Season 3 contains many of the show's top best episodes to date. The season starts off with ""Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days"", a sunny opener. Rory's college future is first taken on in the third episode, the hysterical ""Application Anxiety"". One of the best episodes is ""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"", a dazzling episode that sees Lorelei and Rory participating in the town's dance-a-thon, but things go bad when the ongoing Dean/Jess rivalry comes to a head. Fantastic. ""Let The Games Begin"" is a hilarious elder Gilmore centered episode that puts Rory's future college plans into question. The holidays come into play with the wonderful ""A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving"", where the girls are invited to 4 different Thanksgiving dinners. Lorelei's backstory comes into play in the teriffic ""Dear Emily And Richard"", a flashback rich episode that shows a young Lorelei getting pregnant with Rory, and the rift between her and her parents when she goes into labor. Old beau Max Medina comes back into Lor's life in the unforgettable ""Keg! Max!"", which also has a slamming party that causes mayhem for Rory and Lane. The character of Jess caused a lot of great mayhem with other characters, but was always a one note, one sided character himself with no real story for being the way he is. He was on book smart level with Rory, but other than that, they didn't have anything in common and were wrong for each other. Jess' departure starts in ""Say Goodnight, Gracie"", when his dad shows up, and completely leaves in ""Here Comes The Son"", which was supposed to set up his own spin-off, which never happened. The season ends with one of the shows' greatest finales, ""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio"", which sees Rory graduate from Chilton. It was a monumental and classic episode to go out on. One of the best. There is plenty more to relish in these 22 episodes, and those are just the tip of the iceberg. Other great pleasures include ""The Big One"", which includes a hilarious after sex talk between Paris and Rory. ""One's Got Class & The Other One Dyes"" is classic Gilmore, and it has Lorelei sweating bullets when her past comes into question when giving a talk to a high school class about getting pregnant at 16. The cast continues to shine and show that they are one of the finest and tighest ensembles on television. It continues to be a crime that they, and the show itself, doesn't recogniting from the Emmy's. Lauren Graham becomes more and more amazing with each passing season, and she is definitley one of the best actresses, with one of the best characters, on TV at the moment. Alexis Bledel is still the best kid on the tube, and everyone else showcases what a fine ensemble cast should be. The writing is still some of the most amazing on television, and you really need to know your stuff and pop culture to know some of the things they are talking about. Season 3 of Gilmore Girls is top notch, quality television, and it makes you wish that all TV shows could be this good.",1110067200,65,3804,4.670640834575261
2225870,5,B0007OY2MG,"I have totally become addicted to Gilmore Gils and I cannot wait until the third season comes out on DVD!  At first I did not want anything to do with the show when it first came into reruns.  I thought, ""God, why put this on ABC Family and bump Boy Meets World to an earlier time slot?""  But then as I began to watch bits and pieces of the shows I began to relize what a corky and funny show it truely is.  I was really missing out.  Since then I have not missed a NEW episode and I even have to get dressed in YALE attire to watch it (call me crazy)...  I own both seasons One and Two and I highly reccomend them.  I watch them everyday and can almost recite most of the episodes by now.  Gilmore Girls is the best show on television, I've even gotten my whole family into it (including my dad)...  And for all the other Gilmore fans out there, I feel your pain when you say 'I can't wait for Season Three!'",1109721600,4,909,4.0055555555555555
