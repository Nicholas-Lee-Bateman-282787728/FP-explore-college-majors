205114,5,5555084080,"The differences between Minnelli's film and the novel (especially the Dover Thrift Edition translated by Eleanor Marx Aveling,  Karl Marx' daughter) make for interesting classroom discussion.  Many themes parallel contemporary  life - the notion that `things' will make us happy, obsession with fame, and the crack-whore (so aptly called by a college student) scene at the end.",1178928000,,377,5.578947368421052
205115,5,5555084080,"Madame Bovary is a difficut piece to translate to film.  It is very easy for the heroine to become either dislikable: either willfull (the PBS version with Francesca Annis) or peevish (the Isabelle Hubert french version).

  What Minnelli so masterfully and ironically captures here is the ""dream machine"" that drives Madame Bovary (and society) to be dissatisfied with their daily lives, to want and need more and therefore to be perpetually unhappy with what they have.  Of course, Minnelli was part of that machine for Hollywood, which is the irony.  Here he uses the period-correct analogy of romance novels and magazine ads (and to a lesser extent operas and plays) as vehicles that feed and drive Bovary's dissonance with her reality.  (James Mason as Flaubert, too!)

  The irony that Flaubert was faulted for denegrating the french woman is fully captured here as well.  This version still doesn't get to a real meaty statement of realization that men were not considered immorral or corrupt it they have affairs and forget about their children; but women were.  Personally, I think that may have been one of Flaubert's real points - this same behavior would have been tolerated and venerated in a male.

  Where this production succeeds so brilinatly over the others I mentioned is in the writing and performance of Emma.  She is clearly delineated as being a victim of the commercials of her time - the ultimate consumer, and therefore very identifiable.  Jone's own personal charm also factors in here.  Her fresh innocence and desire to be liked and to entertain come through the role and make her sweeter.  Annis is often a bit self satisfied and Hubbert ice cold, making their Emmas less likable, although perfectly valid and well performed roles, just the difference that writing, production and acting bring to the role.

  Minnelli liked women and identified with foibles.  He gives a very nice slant to Dr. Bovary, too.  (Gives him a little more self knowledge and honor than Flaubert did, which also colors the relationship and the film.)  Louis Jordan as her dream man is also colored very nicely here, as being sincerely in love with her and very conflicted.  Something he does very well, and this all creates a marvelously satisfying production and package.  When you add the great score, you have a very fine film indeed.",1177891200,15,2344,4.943589743589744
205116,3,5555084080,"Minnelli directed this with his usual tact and talent, though it remains not one of his best works. The stellar cast, however, is excellent, dominating it is Jennifer Jones, beautiful as she can be, and in a paranoic role that suits her well. The sets, costumes, dancing scenes, etc. are shot in Minnelli's typical style. The thing is that a literary classic as this story is is quite impossible to translate into cinema. Hitchcock never dared (he knew better), and explained to Truffaut why these experiments were doomed to fail.

A story like ""Madame Bovary"" belongs in the books, it's a marriage of language and the imagination. But if somebody had to do it no one better suited than Minnelli.",1176854400,19,696,4.8
205117,5,5555084080,"""Madame Bovary"" is one of those rare films that only gets better with age; with each viewing, one notices new elements to appreciate. Vincente Minelli crafted a perfectly literate interpretation of Gustave Flaubert's famed novel. The following is a breakdown of the unifying elements which make ""Madame Bovary"" so spectacular:

DIRECTION: Minelli's keen eye for composing unforgettable scenes is perfectly realized with ""Madame Bovary"". The ballroom sequence, with its dizzying 360 degree camera angles, is an exasperating metaphor of Emma Bovary's existence and serves as a symbolic foreshadowing of what is to become of her. C'est magnifique!

SCREENPLAY:Robert Ardrey's screenplay is deftly paced and packed full of poignant dialogue.

CINEMATOGRAPHY: As mentioned earlier, the ballroom sequence is amazing-perhaps the most intricate and inspired of its kind in cinematic history. Robert Planck's moody black & white photography make it all possible. Planck captures Emma at the height of all her fantasies--gazing upward at her reflection, being adored and adulated by throngs of male suitors, in an ornate mirror hanging on the ceiling--brilliant composition!!!

ART & SET DIRECTION: All of the Rococco and Baroque grandeur of 1850s France is expertly represented in ""Madame Bovary"".

COSTUME DESIGN: Costume designer, Walter Plunkett, also known for his Academy Award winning work in ""Gone With the Wind"", created costumes for Jennifer Jones which rival his masterpieces for Vivien Leigh. Plunkett complimented Jones saying, ""She has exquisite shoulders like Vivien Leigh"", and further complimented her in the film by designing a show-stopping ball gown that emphasized her ""exquisite shoulders"", to say the least. Yards and yards of white toulle give the impression of Jennifer Jones, with her perfect posture and elegant carriage, gliding and floating across the ballroom like a cloud.

MUSICAL SCORE: Most film historians agree that the score for ""Madame Bovary"" is one of Miklos Rosza's greatest. ""The Madame Bovary Waltz"" is haunting, energetic, restless-completely representative of Emma Bovary.

PERFORMANCES:Jennifer Jones delivers a superb, emotive performance as Emma Bovary-moments of hysterical melodrama are balanced with poignantly relevant ""underacting"", such as the unforgettable scene when Emma returns home to her furious husband, Charles after having ingested arsenic. Jones perfectly conveys the gravity of what Emma has done to herself and to the people in her life. She kisses her estranged daughter for the last time. She responds to Charles' accusations, simply, ""Don't hate me now, Charles."" This is what ""character acting"" is all about!! Jennifer Jones is in tune with Emma Bovary, from her self-destructive, neurotic drive towards melodrama to her sad, painful death. For her stunning achievement, Jones was awarded the French equivalent of the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film Actress in 1949. Who better to judge one of the greatest French literary heroines than the French themselves?

The Actors: Van Heflin is totally believable as Charles Bovary. Louis Jourdan is perfect as Rodolphe, and makes a beautiful match to Jennifer Jones. James Mason is thoughtful and earnest as the great author, Gustave Flaubert, who also serves as the narrator.

CONCLUSION: ""Madame Bovary"" is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking. Its longevity has been established, due in part to the cohesive elements listed above. Take note to all of these elements when you watch the film-it will be a much more illuminating and satisfying experience.",1172361600,59,3565,5.587037037037037
205118,5,5555084080,"Emma Bovary, married to a stolid, unromantic doctor longs for a life both more passionate and upper class than her own. In a desperate search for love and satisfaction, she throws herself into torrid love affairs, and puts herself in dire financial straits by living extravagantly. When Emma realizes she will never achieve the exciting lifestyle she so desperately wants, her actions become more extreme, leading to her downfall...

At the time of its release, Bosley Crowther of the New York Times had this to say about it:

If such a thing were needed in this candid day and age as a moral defense of ""Madame Bovary,"" the classic novel of Gustave Flaubert, then Metro's handsome film version, which came to the Capitol yesterday, would be precisely the item to turn this unlikely trick. For not only is this picture a faithful transcription of the tale of the misguided nineteenth-century housewife who rushed down the primrose path to ruin, but Metro has actually put it in the form of an open defense.

With James Mason playing the author on trial, at the start of the film, for writing this ""infamous"" novel--as, indeed, Flaubert actually was--the studio has had Mr. Mason speak a virtual preface to the work and offer occasional commentaries as an off-screen voice as the story unreels. Thus it has made it specific that Emma Bovary's tragic career was not the result of willful sinning by a selfish and licentious dame but was the consequence of her environment, her upbringing and her childish dreams. ""We had taught her to believe in Cinderella,"" Mr. Mason's voice tenderly remarks.

And this understanding of the lady is beautifully and tenderly put forth in the patient unfolding of the story which a cohort of talents has contrived. Emma, throughout the picture--throughout her unhappy life--is the victim of her hopeless illusions, the silt of a romantic age. Not in her poor but loving husband does she find the man of her dreams, not in her dazzling, high-born lover nor in the pitiful law clerk with whom she absorbs. Nothing remains for her ambition. The end is ruin and despair, shame and desolation, arsenic and death. It is all very sad and depressing, but that, says Mr. Mason, is life.

Well, at least, it is grist and fodder to Metro's fine-grinding mill, and the best that one could ask for has been made from this tragic tale. Robert Ardrey has put it together into a literate and playable script and Vincente Minelli has kept it moving with a smooth and refined directoral touch. The high point of his achievement, indeed, is a ballroom scene which spins in a whirl of rapture and crashes in a shatter of shame. In this one sequence, the director has fully visualized his theme.

Perhaps a better performance of Emma Bovary could be wished than the generally beaming and breathless (or else frowning) one which Jennifer Jones gives. Miss Jones, though perfectly constructed for the wearing of clothes and aureoles, is a little bit light for supporting the anguish of this classic dame. But Louis Jourdan is electric as her elegant lover, Rodolphe, and Van Heflin is quietly appealing as her trusting, small-town spouse. A nicely dimensioned portrait of the weakling lover is given by Christopher Kent, and Frank Allenby is brilliantly malefic as the usurous merchant, Lhereux. Gene Lockhart, Gladys Cooper and Henry Morgan are good in minor roles. And, to be sure, Mr. Mason does well by Flaubert and the defense.

But, of course, the ultimate question is simply whether a defense of ""Madame Bovary"" is timely, after all these wicked years. And from that we reach the question of whether Emma is timely herself. Many ladies much like her have been seen on the screen for many years. She looks pretty in this picture, but she also looks slightly dclass.",1167177600,15,3779,4.858695652173913
205119,4,5555084080,"No one could top MGM for its sumptuous production values.  Madame Bovary is no exception.  Jennifer Jones, loaned to MGM by her husband David O. Selznick, portrays Emma Bovary with flourish, passion and deep intensity.  However, her portrayal is marred by severe tics, grimaces and facial contortions which director, Vincente Minnelli failed to control.  These flaws in Jones portrayal are a bit distracting.  By the last reel one is simply tired of Emma and her wanton ways and her death is a relief and a pleasure.  The poor woman didn't know a good thing when she had it..namely a husband as portrayed by Van Heflin who seems miscast in his role.  We would have had more sympathy for Emma if a less dynamic leading man had been cast...or a lesser attractive one.  MGM's production values are top notch and Jones' costumes are incredible.",1106352000,9,840,4.825174825174825

However, if you can  settle for a beautifully filmed Hollywoodized adaption of the novel, then  this is it. First of all, the cinematography and the sets are excellent.  You can tell that they are sets but they are very well done. The acting,  especially Jennifer Jones in the title role, is outstanding. Supporting  cast is fine also with the always memorable Gladys Cooper and the  incredibly handsome Louis Jourdan especially stand out. And look for Ellen  Corby (Grandma Walton) as the maid. Two scenes are highly notable - the  ball sequence is spectacular and the scene where Emma awaits Rodolphe on  the deserted windswept streets in the middle of the night is beautifully  done.

The movie opens with the author, Gustave Flaubert on trial for writing an `offensive' piece of literature. He defends himself by asserting he was making a hard hitting swipe against the shallowness and downright immorality of the Paris Elite. While he admits Emma (the main character) is shallow, selfish, self-destructive and a victim of her own bad choices he also adds it is partly OUR fault as society for encouraging the `fantasy land, dreams-come-true, happily-ever-after, Prince Charming' books because they cultivate a mentality that CANNOT see a person through real life.

""What had we taught her with those romantic novels? Absurd dreams of luxury, fashion and love that never existed. We had taught her to believe in Cinderella. We had taught her that the fairyland was enchanting and the real world was contemptible.""
Jennifer Jones' searing, intense portrayal of a woman who takes a trip down the rabbit hole is one of the most heartbreaking performances I have ever seen and I will NEVER understand why she didn't receive a Best Leading Actress nomination. Those who say she was an incompetent actress (lisping, face-twisting, etc.) need to see this movie and eat mud. Her acting is so natural and un-self-conscious, free from mannerisms and tics. Her voice is so soft, creamy and soothing, her delicate heart-shaped face so luminous, her beautiful smile and sparkling eyes which convey emotion so effortlessly--and those luscious gowns were simply MADE for her.

Emma is definitely VERY unlikeable (we are not SUPPOSED to like her, of course) but not so much to the point where I felt completely detached from her plight. It would have been so much easier to portray her as a completely heartless, unremorseful floozy but instead Jones plays her as an everyday, average woman who wants to make a name for herself in society, who wants to improve her livelihood, but unfortunately has bought into the fairy tale lie and uses the wrong methods to achieve aristocracy. (Two wealthy boyfriends and large furniture debts for her husband)

What I love best about her portrayal is how she makes Emma very sweet; good natured and likeable at the beginning and during her first few scenes with her husband Charles.

If she wasn't likeable at first she wouldn't seem real and we wouldn't have such a great story. But everything leading up to the loss of her morals and her ultimate demise is wonderfully foreshadowed throughout--like that speech she makes about the bell tolling to announce ""the death of another hour"" and when she frantically asks Charles ""Do you want me to love you?"" when he refuses to become a surgeon to make more money since he doesn't have that range of abilities.
When she realizes she has beggared her husband and daughter and her lovers can't bail her out of her enormous debts she stuffs herself with arsenic because she can never forgive herself let alone look her husband in the face. Her final bedroom scene is a great highlight of character acting where Jennifer Jones once again shows she is more than just a mere pretty face to dress the set--one viewing of this scene with her screaming and writhing in agony as her husband unsuccessfully tries to save her is enough to last a lifetime, it looks so real.

My favorite of her scenes are:
1. Joyfully throwing herself at Charles (her husband) when he proposes to her. He lets her know what she's stepping into though--others are younger, more handsome and charismatic and he is poor and simple yet he loves her in his own honest, heartfelt way...OOOOHHH the FORESHADOWING!!!
2. Her face radiates with light and joy when she tells her husband the morning after the wedding how she's going to make him the nicest little cottage he ever lived in.
3. Crying that she wants a son so he doesn't have to be subjected to social limitations and restraints the way a woman is. She flips out right after her husband throws a party for her and you simply KNOW she is one of those people that can NEVER be satisfied.
4. The uneasy look on her face and way she moves her eyes as she whispers in a low grave tone ""Don't Rudolph. Don't. My husband is sitting only thirty feet from that window."" when Rudolph is making the moves on her. Even though she's growing apart from her husband she is not yet so wicked that she feels no shame.
5. Shivering all over, unconscious, eyes glazed over in terror, whispering ""Rudolph. Rudolph."" Right after her husband catches her trying to jump out the window rather than face up to how she was going to elope with Rudolph.

6. When the furniture man tells her off towards the end after the skeletons have fallen out of her closet. It was ABOUT TIME she heard the truth about herself. Even the author, Flaubert says at the end ""Men do not like the truth, it is brutal, it is inconvenient but they have no power to define it. Truth lives forever. Men do not.""
7. Scratching back to Rudolph, all sugary smiles and laughter trying to get him in a good mood before asking him to pay her debts--but he can tell it is merely a faade. Finally she drops the fake act and tells the truth--she needs money. Louis Jordan relishes his line delivery for all it is worth ""Money. WHY didn't I REALIZE it was MONEY?""

Van Heflin is absolutely heartbreaking as the husband of a woman who fails to love him back. He is warm-hearted, forgiving and plays the Good Shepherd whenever she's in trouble. He isn't perfect. He isn't handsome, charming, clever or well-spoken but he still strikes me as a man from an era when men got up every morning to make money for the family instead of whining around about little inconveniences the way women do. To be his friend would be an HONOR, to be his wife an EVER GREATER HONOR something Emma cannot grasp. When she eats the arsenic at the end instead of going about his business thinking ""YAY! I won't have that worthless grasping woman tied to my leg anymore!"" he rushes upstairs and tries to save her. Even though she has cheated on him TWICE he loves her SO MUCH he doesn't WANT her to die. As she is writhing and gasping in pain while the poison claims her body she mutters with all the pathos of the world ""Why do you always try to put me back together Charles?"" I feel like the Charles/Emma relationship is one of the most powerful portraits of the complicated bond between husband and wife and I challenge anyone who sees this movie to try to gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of ""For better or for worse, for rich or for poor, in sickness or in health and forsaking all others.""
Louis Jordan is not only jaw droppingly gorgeous as Rudolph--helping us understand Emma's `fall'--but does a terrific job showing the sharp dramatic transformation from a smooth talking, womanizing playboy to an older, wiser more mature gentleman.

My favorite of his scenes is where he dumps Emma when she comes scratching back for money--she's smiling, laughing and talking about the `good old days' and you can tell from those searing, dark, intense, glittering eyes and stony frown that he's looking RIGHT THROUGH HER.
Then he gives her a severe but well deserved tongue lashing when she re-professes her 'love' for him over and over. She asks him why he didn't show up to take her away to his mansion in Paris France like he promised. He replies ""I was afraid of you Emma. You ask for something that consumes everything it touches. I didn't want to be destroyed by you.""

In other words, he realized what a selfish gold-digger she was. He wouldn't have been able to please her any more than her husband had and therefore it was best to detach himself from her as quickly as possible. ""You've brought this on yourself. Why should I share your humiliation? I don't have the money and I cannot help you. Now GET OUT.""

Alf Kjellin plays Leon, Emma's second lover who unlike Rudolph does not learn his lesson. At first he seems as hard as a rock but at the end you realize he is only made out of sand.

Miklos Rozsa's music is lush, dramatic and intense and his waltz with the ever ascending and descending arpeggios and octaves is absolutely unforgettable.

Production values (cinematography, sets and costumes) are magnificent.

If you're looking for a movie about characters to admire you've definitely come to the wrong place but if you're looking for a movie that upholds a moral truth to society (in this case, that wonderful feelings and material goods cannot bring fulfillment) and you don't mind the absence of a final note of hope and redemption look no further than Madame Bovary.

205168,2,5555084080,"Quick review, since the copy of the disk I received stopped playing half-way into the movie.
My critiques:  Jennifer Jones is better as the movie moves on, and Emma becomes unhinged; at the begginning, I don't think the character is true to the book.  Emma is too forthcoming, too obvious in her attempts to attract Charles. In the book, she's much more passive.

Other important changes to the story:  Charles had been married once to an older harpie in the book; in the film, he's a bachelor.  The whole club-foot operation on poor Hippolyte never takes place in the film; Charles just simply walks away prior to surgery, aware that he won't be able to carry it out successfully.  In the book, he botches the operation and leaves the cripple in worse condition than before.

Other details in the film seem out of sequence from what I remember in the book.  Since I had to return the damaged disk and get a credit, I'm opting to purchase one of the BBC versions, which I am sure will be more faithful to Flaubert's book.",1369958400,2,1021,4.540983606557377

205170,4,5555084080,"The story of Madame Bovary's marriage, her bad choices in life, and her death is told within the framework of the court trial of Gustave Flaubert who is being judged for having outraged society's moral expectations of writers.  From what I could discern about this trial, it seemed as if ""society"" had gotten the impression that Flaubert was advocating Madame Bovary's choices in life, and Flaubert was speaking in his defense.  His defense narrative constitutes a narrative of Emma's story.

Flaubert explains that Emma Bovary's life, arising out of poverty, has been totally influenced by the overt, florid, Romantic expectations of her time.  She has become as if enchanted from girlhood by pictures of romantically beautiful personages in lush, beautiful, sensually-appealing settings.  These pictures which adorn her walls depict the wonderfully appealing things that can be obtained through wealth, position, and prestige.  Emma will have to have money to get this beauty that enthralls her.

The romantic artwork of the day with which Emma adorns her bedroom walls are the ""icons"" that she veritably adores and cherishes throughout her entire, rather brief adult life.  The film-viewer sees the pictures being removed from her walls after her death.  (It doesn't take much imagination to realize that Emma is not much different in her century from modern teenagers who cover the walls of their rooms with pictures of their Media idols.  And the gorgeous photographs in contemporary magazines of everything from shoes to perfume to antique collections still serve as a source of intense imaginings which inspire us modern consumers to acquire these ""beautiful"" (or otherwise exciting) identities and settings that are for sale to us.)

In Emma's story, marriage to Dr. Bovary appears to be a step up for her socially, but the plain, ordinary, non-distinguished (and yet very likable) physician is not able to fulfill her longings.  Her exquisite beauty and taste are supports as she undertakes her exuberant project to establish in her home the perfect setting of Beauty and Social Importance that she is desperate to obtain.

It seems to me that Flaubert, as writer on trial in this movie-tale, attempts to SHOW by simply telling the facts of Emma's story that Emma's choices derive from a reaction to her circumstances of early poverty, and perhaps the natural advantage of personal beauty, plus the exacerbation of romantic expectations built into the cultural values of her times.  Also, in these court scenes where Flaubert is on trial for immoral writing, it SEEMS that he is exonerating his lack of blatant moralizing, his refusal to state harsh judgments against Emma's behavior, by his choice to let Emma's story stand as a self-evident moral commentary.  An exact, clear statement of Flaubert's argument exonerating himself, as presented in this movie, I find impossible to make.  I find it comes across vaguely.

Anyway, overall, on the one hand, the movie seems to be a justification of Flaubert's artist's right to tell his tale and let it stand as a public statement of unvarnished ""truth"" that does not preach in an explicit way.  The actual story itself of Emma, on the other hand, is about a woman who clearly repents at the end of her life, kissing the Cross as she receives the last rites of her French-Catholic faith.  Her repentance is clearly a deliberate element in Emma's story as created by Flaubert--at least as this film presents Flaubert's story.  And the story will be clearly felt by the reader or viewer to be mostly a pitiful and aggravating tale about a woman enmeshed in desperate,  WRONG choices.  Some modern viewers will be able to pity Emma; some viewers will want to angrily judge Emma--even despite the evidence on film of her repentance.  The reaction to Flaubert's tale about Emma as presented in the movie will depend upon the viewers' spiritual maturity and self-knowledge perhaps.  And Flaubert's right to write a non-moralized tale without being censured is not likely to be at all contested in the societal freedom of most modern cultures now.

As Emma's story begins, Jennifer Jones plays a young woman of very exceptional beauty.  The viewer soon looks upon (perhaps gapes at) an entrancing vision of angelic beauty!  At the point after her marriage when Emma sets about establishing an exquisitely beautiful house, I began to feel almost suffocated by the voluminous intensity of Beauty that Emma creates and exudes in her gorgeously-dressed person and her beautifully-appointed house.  (It's interesting to watch the changes that occur in her face and hair as time goes on.  I do seem to recall that on her deathbed she appears to regain some of the beauty of her early innocent youth, but I could be misremembering that brief, darkened glimpse of her in that scene.)

As mentioned, Emma's husband, played by Van Heflin, is a very likable, humble, ordinary man without great ambitions.  It's really painful to watch the story of Emma's failure to appreciate her husband who seems such a good man--and her little girl, who instinctively rejects her up until the time when Emma undergoes regret and repentance, at which point there is a brief warm acceptance between the child and Emma.  Also, the desperate end of life that Emma brings upon herself is alarming and painful to observe.

The novel ""Madame Bovary"" is now a literary classic, and this movie might rightly enjoy a classic status for several reasons.  But I found the story so unpleasant to observe that once will probably be enough for me to go through this painful story of the tragic life (and death) choices of Emma Bovary.  --I am expressing here my reactions to the FILM and not to Flaubert's novel.  Literary scholars, preachers and moralists, film experts, anybody at all may find my comments superficial, incorrect, objectionable.

So she finds adventure and romance with aristocrat Louis Jourdan.  Best scene: a dazzling ballroom scene with stunning music by Miklos Rozsa bringing Mme Bovary to a romantic ecstasy but it thrown over by her new lover.  The Isabelle Huppert version is closer in French to the original, bu both end in suicidal disaster and disappointment for the central figurel  Both versions deserve to be seen.",1367107200,,589,5.09375

Now about the DVD its surprisingly quite nice the DVD comes with a cute little classic droopy cartoon called Out Foxed I enjoyed, and also there's another short ironically called those good old days the DVD also has scene selection feature I liked that because sometimes classic DVDs don't have this feature and I like being able to stop the movie if I need or want to, and later pick up right where it left off. DVD art is nice, and of course the film shows great clear crisp, all and all just a very nice DVD at good price.",1301875200,2,926,4.202247191011236

Van heflin in this film is so great.  Louis Jourdan acting as a stud just doesnt cut it.  This film should get a remake it would be great now that all inhibitions have been removed from the industry.

205204,4,5555084080,"Jennifer Jones got to play two of classic literature's most fascinating heroines during her screen career: Theodore Dreiser's ""Sister Carrie"", and Gustave Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"".

In director Vincente Minnelli's sumptuous 1949 movie version of the Flaubert masterpiece, Jennifer Jones gives one of her most frenzied, haunted performances as the country doctor's young wife whose impossible dreams of wealth and high romance eventually bring ruin and disgrace.

Van Heflin co-stars as Doctor Bovary, with Gladys Cooper, Louis Jourdan, Alf Kjellin, Gene Lockhart; and James Mason (who plays Flaubert himself).  Whilst the film looks fantastic in B&W, I'm wondering how much more spectacular it would have been in Technicolor, considering Minnelli's flair in the colour medium (""The Band Wagon"", ""Ziegfeld Follies"", ""Lust for Life"").  The highlight of the entire movie is the party scene where Emma Bovary's romantic dreams finally come to their climax, scored by one of Mikls Rzsa's most stridant waltz melodies (Minnelli was most proud of this sequence and justifiably-so).

James Mason's role as the author, in the court scene, is very impressive, bringing out underlying social issues and women's issues. The beauty of Jennifer Jones stands out,and  the charm of Louis Jourdan is remarkable. Both their acting skills are phenomenal. Van Heflin brings on the essence of his part of the betrayed and destroyed, but dutiful husband and father. This is one of the best `old' movies from 1949.",1259452800,3,467,5.144736842105263
205206,4,5555084080,"The three leads in Vincente Minnelli's MADAME BOVARY (1949) do an exemplary job. Kudos especially to Jennifer Jones for her skilled portrayal of a woman with absolutely NO redeeming qualities.

The story opens with author Gustave Flaubert on trial for obscenity because of the stir his first (and best) novel has caused. (Although James Mason as the writer provides occasional voiceovers, he's really not a ""lead"" in the classic sense.)

""Madame Bovary"" is set in the Normandy region of France. Young doctor Charles Bovary (Van Heflin) meets Emma Rouault while visiting her father's farm to set the owner's broken leg. He's charmed by the girl and keeps returning to supposedly check on his patient. They are eventually married.

Dreamer Emma immediately talks of redecorating the struggling physician's home. She spends money that neither of them have by clandestinely signing IOUs with the sly merchant Monsieur Lheureux (Frank Allenby), who promises to keep her debts a secret (Lheureux does so only for as long as it suits him).

With their home now refurbished, Emma needs a new project. She tells Charles that she wants to have a son. Some months later a baby girl is born. A disappointed Emma neglects the infant from the outset and Berthe is raised by a wet nurse. Ennui deepens into apathy. A dolled-up Mrs. Bovary ignores her husband at a fancy party; he gets drunk and embarrasses her. She has affairs with law clerk Lon Dupuis (Alf Kjellin) and aristocratic Rodolphe Boulanger (Louis Jourdan) that Charles chooses to ignore.

Love for Boulanger is so intense that Emma persuades him to flee with her to Italy. When he learns of her plans to leave, Lheureux is concerned for what's owed him. Threatening to seek repayment from Charles, Lheureux still abets Emma's scheme by waiting outside his office at night with her for Boulanger's carriage to arrive. Then, they catch sight of it...

Other cast members include Gene Lockhart (J. Homais), Gladys Cooper (Madame Dupuis), Harry Morgan (Hyppolite), George Zucco (Dubocage) and Ellen Corby (Flicit).",1248912000,4,2059,5.076923076923077

205208,3,5555084080,"I have to give MADAME BOVARY a mixed review.

It's interesting to note that a film based on a French classic had only one Oscar nomination in a technical category--none for the direction or performances. That's probably because despite all the painstaking care that went into this version of MADAME BOVARY, it seems to make a surface connection with the viewer.

JENNIFER JONES has the role of a woman even more selfish than Scarlett O'Hara--dazzled by her own romantic illusions to the point where she has lost all connection with reality. She has a faithful husband (VAN HEFLIN) whom she treats with contempt or totally ignores in favor of more interesting prospects--and almost finds one in LOUIS JOURDAN, once again playing a Frenchman who abandons his sweetheart when he realizes she will make too many demands on him.

Vincente Minnelli has directed the whole affair with a rather sluggish pace, relieved occasionally by well-staged scenes such as the ballroom moment where the music of Miklos Rozsa reaches a crescendo of emotion amid whirling camera movements. It's a great moment but unfortunately most of the film's remaining scenes seem to pale by comparison with that stunning triumph of music and photography.

JENNIFER JONES is unable to make her Madame Bovary appear anything more than vain and foolish and, as usual, there's something alienating about her personality--which should have suited the role but keeps her from becoming the victim she's supposed to be.

The JAMES MASON courtroom prologue with the actor as Flaubert seems to be operating from a different film and doesn't blend well into the actual story. Perhaps a different approach would have worked better.

Still, this is a better than average melodrama of a woman scorned who turns out to be her own worst enemy. While all the performances around her are more than adequate, none of them really stand out the way they should in an adaptation of a classic story.

Fans of Jones, Jourdan or Heflin will no doubt find the film fascinating despite its flaws and the Miklos Rozsa score is worth hearing for the ballroom sequence alone.",1234656000,4,2113,4.985795454545454
205209,5,5555084080,"If anyone values the importance of presentation, it has to be Jennifer Jones.  In the beginning of the movie, we see her behind the scenes just barely, dressed like a shabby servant.  She runs upstairs after the doctor arrives, only to appear later in a Walter Plunkett masterpiece, preparing breakfast for the young doctor (Van Heflin).  What a cinderella makeover....in less than five minutes.  And when she arrives at the ball and removes her shawl, she immediatelly puts all the ladies in the ballroom to shame with her extraordiary beauty and gown.  My breath was taken away in almost every scene with every outfit.  And all this does not detract from her fantastic acting performance of the highly neurotic Emma Bovary.  She really deserved an Oscar for her acting in this amazing movie.  I am so glad she filmed this movie and gave what I think was  a glowing incandescent performance.  In fact, everyone connected with the film was great. Don't miss this one.  Also, notice the magnificent sound track by Miklos Rozsa.  It has to be one of his best.",1198800000,5,1057,4.779005524861878
205210,5,5555084080,"I had heard of ""Madame Bovary,"" and even seen clips from it, but I was blown away by seeing the entire film. Jennifer Jones brings such depth to Flaubert's restless character, it's the hallmark of what defines an ""actress."" (I read somewhere that Lana Turner was slated to play the part, one can only imagine her one dimension ability in this.) The entire cast is wonderful, Van Heflin as her long suffering husband, Louis Jordan as her would be lover & Christopher Kent as the man she thinks can bail her out of her financial difficulties. Emma Bovary is a restless young girl, whose visions of love & marriage have been stoked by romantic novels & pretty pictures. She marries and finds out all is not as she thought it would be & therein lies the tale of deceit, contempt & ultimate tragedy. Also in the cast, long before they were TV icons, are Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H, as a dimwitted clubfoot & Ellen Corby of The Waltons, as the Bovary's maid. The celebrated ballroom scene is a marvel, considering the film was released in 1949. Director Vincente Minnelli once again amazes us with his fabulous direction.",1192406400,3,1112,4.649746192893401
