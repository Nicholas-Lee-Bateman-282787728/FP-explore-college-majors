8295881,5,B001E0PGRC,I love these dvds from master sculptor John Brown and on top of that I am a rabid fanboy of comic books. This dvd does require that you either already know what you are doing or have seen the rest of John Brown's dvds. The other review clearly doesn't get that and I find his narrow minded opinion kind of insulting since I find this to be the best dvd from John Brown yet. If you loved his other dvds and want to see how he would approach sculpting a more masculine character then you need to get this!,1361232000,2,503,4.090909090909091
8295882,2,B001E0PGRC,"I realize this video is part of a series. If you buy this video and don't realize it John Brown will remind you over and over in his voice over of this video. This is my least favorite of the John Brown videos I own and I watched it with the sound off because he doesn't really say anything that helps you learn to sculpt anymore than just watching him sculpt will. In my opinion, Ray Villafane's pumpkin carving video is more informative about learning to sculpt and showing tricks to achieving a successful sculpt than this video.",1360368000,2,532,4.438775510204081
