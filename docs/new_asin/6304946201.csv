7879706,5,6304946201,"This is a great 50 minute video that covers the drill teams of the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and Army.  There is a good bit of background information about the equipment used and the selection process as well as interviews with the members of the teams.  Each branch's segment features an unnarrated performance so you can sit back and enjoy the whole show.  I have watched it several times and I love it every time.",1025395200,5,420,4.5
