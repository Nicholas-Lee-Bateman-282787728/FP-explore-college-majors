8257560,4,B00154GEGO,"I approached this movie with trepidation.  Being a Mad Man fan I wanted to see Vincent Kartheiser's other work.  The trailer was unappealing but I plowed ahead as I'm a ""completionist"".

I was in for a surprise.  The ending really shifted my entire perspective of the movie.  I actually watched again and found it far more enjoyable the second time around.

SPOILER-FREE Review:

What Worked:
- The message at the end.  Can't say any more except it was not at all expected.
- Craig's addiction to both Zelda and Ellen.  Played for laughs, you can still feel a little pain there.
- The friendship; if you have one of these friendships you can appreciate the easy comfort these two have and the amount of crap they put up with
- Acting. We should despise Craig, he's a trainwreck, but his own self-help bits bring the pathos and the funny. Terry is played pitch perfect and each action totally believable. At the end I cared about what happened to these guys. I didn't think that during the first half of the movie.

So-So:
- The self-help teacher.  If they had just left it to the classroom scene it would have been a brilliant send-up.  The second scene was too much.
- The pacing.  The scenes kept cutting before I wanted them too.

What Didn't Work:
- Craig's bizarre high school dream sequence was not necessary, it didn't really inform the story. I would have rather had a friendship memory to show Terry/Craig's history beyond the beat-up scene and the prom.
- Cringe-worthy early 1980's prom dance scene.  It was supposed to be 1991 but the hairstyles and clothing were all too dated.  Also the dance number was more confusing than funny.  Seems like the director had a couple of ""comedy set pieces"" in mind and fit them in whether or not they belonged.

If there were half stars I'd rate 3.5.  The director tried too hard.  A little slower pacing with more character development and less zaniness would have made the story more compelling throughout.  The third act makes the movie worthwhile. Buy or rent as I'm sure at least a few of the scenes won't be on regular TV.",1323648000,,2077,4.574525745257453
8257561,1,B00154GEGO,"Starts out, a guy beating the living tar out of another over zelda sparks(sarah carter),then the story line was as confusing as all get out to follow, Then the beautiful trans am firebird they shove off into a steep hill into the ocean. I love firebirds so that even makes me want rate this even lower. Im not going to give away the ending. I don't know whats worse the ending or the movie. Horrible acting,directing and poorly written. But this movie isn't even worth renting.dont waist your money on this movie.rent it first if you think its worth buying. I was dissappionted. Id give this movie a -15..take my advice watch it, before buying it...",1240012800,2,649,4.603448275862069

This movie was great from beginning to end. The performances were entertaining. Sarah Carter was hot as Zelda. There's a good twist, and there's more comedy than expected in this ""thriller"". Buy it!",1215388800,3,355,8.128205128205128
