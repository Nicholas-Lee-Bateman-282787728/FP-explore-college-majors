665707,5,630348364X,"A wonderfull musical treat. The songs are witty and imaginative
with a big dose of just plain fun!

665708,5,630348364X,"I've loved this Peanuts special from the minute I saw it. I own the CD soundtrack from the 60's play (with Gary Burghoff from ""M*A*S*H* as Charlie Brown). I used to sing with the songs all the time. The highlights are the main title, and anything done by Snoopy. ""Queen Lucy"" and ""Oh Give Me a Home"" are funny points. All in all, this is one of the best Peanuts cartoons that have ever been made.",1023926400,8,396,4.223684210526316
665709,2,630348364X,"When I was to play Lucy in the stage version of ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"" last year, I watched this video three times before to prepare, and twice after just for the sake of watching it. It wasn't until  after I had performed the play that I realized how bad it was compared to  the real thing.  The children doing the voices can't act at all (which is  normal for Peanuts cartoons), and their animation seems to be reflecting  that fact. The cartoon character's facial expressions are always all wrong,  as are the emotions in the voices. If someone is irritated or stubborn in  the stage version, they are furious here. If they are excited or  enthusiastic in the stage version, they are  hysterical here. And why do  they sing ""There Is No Team Like The Best Team"" so fast? They are  singing a mile a minute, twice as fast as in most stage versions. This  dosn't add impact, it just makes them seem out of control.  They don't  always follow the script, either. Why does Snoopy say ""The least  Charlie Brown could do is start my day off with a little tea and  toast,"" instead of ""Charlie Brown never brings me coffee in the  morning,"" as the stage Snoopy says?  There's nothing odd or  innapropriate about coffee.  I missed hearing ""My Blanket and  Me,"" and ""The Doctor is In."" If they had to remove songs,  why couldn't they have removed ""Glee Club Rehearsal"" instead?  That wasn't even part of the original stage show, and was my least favorite  number to perform. I also missed several scenes from the stage show,  especially Lucy's Crabbiness Survey.  I didn't like the way they animated  some scenes, showing what was going on in the character's imaginations and  the like. I always feel uncomfortable when Charlie Brown is late with  Snoopy's supper and you actually see the skeleton that Snoopy is imagining  himself becoming. That image haunted me for a long time after I first saw  the cartoon.  There are some highlights, though. ""The Book  Report,"" and ""Schroeder,"" (which I never would have learned  to sing without this rendition) are just fine. One of the sweetest moments  ever is Charlie Brown crying on his letter at the end of the ""Baseball  Game."" Snoopy is perfect. I've read that he played the role on stage  in 1967 and I like him just as much as Roger Bart, the Snoopy on the  Broadway cast recording, which I own. And even ""Glee Club  Rehearsal"" is worth watching at least towards the end, just for the  sake of hearing Snoopy's voice come out of Schroeder.  But those are the  only moments really worth watching, at least as far as I'm concerned.",961545600,28,2583,4.5868131868131865

I know now that I saw this particular stage play.  I have fallen in love with it all over again.  You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown is a great play, much of the scenes play out just as the comics did.  In fact, the writer of the play had written the songs, and needed ""filler,"" so he just bought some of the books and had the cast memorize them for in between the scenes.  It works really well.

666288,4,630348364X,"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown is a Peanuts special that was released in 1985 that's based on a Broadway musical of the same name.  Since it's based on a musical, there's a lot of songs that accompany vignettes, rather than being a special with one storyline.  There are some classic songs in this production, such as ""Book Report"" and ""Happiness.""  While this may not be a ""typical"" Peanuts special, it's an enjoyable viewing, especially if you enjoy musicals.

This DVD includes a remastered version of the special, as well as a documentary titled, ""Animating a Charlie Brown Musical.""  The documentary goes throug the 20-year history of the Clark Gesner album that evolved into an off-Broadway hit that became the basis for this special.  The documentary was interesting to watch, and I learned a bit about this special from watching it.  Admittedly, the documentary won't have much appeal for any kids watching this DVD, but it's a nice bonus for the adults who watch it.

One thing people may find disturbing is that Snoopy has a human voice.

That being said, the charm of the Peanuts is still there so while it's the weakest movie, I still say that a fan should get this movie.",1265587200,,466,4.295454545454546
666292,5,630348364X,"Some musicals just stick with you. Of all the shows I've seen, performed in, read about, or lectured about, there are few that hold the emotional pull of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. I'm sure part of it is because of my affection for the Peanuts comic strip itself, but I also love the sweet, tuneful simplicity of Clark Gesner's songs, and the wry wit of the Charles Schulz vignettes that form the spine of the show. The 1999 Broadway revival of You're a Good Man Charlie Brown left me cold, mostly because it was trying to jazz things up and expand the show, and seemed to lose sight of what made the show appealing in the first place.

Now we have the 1985 animated special on DVD. I remember watching it when it first aired and being less than impressed, but when I popped in the DVD upon its arrival, I was thoroughly delighted. The special has the polished look and feel of the 1970s Charlie Brown specials, as opposed to some of the later specials that seemed a bit slapdash.

Because it needed to fit into an hour-long TV slot, the show has been cut down quite a bit, removing some rather fun numbers, such as Linus's ""My Blanket and Me"" and Snoopy's ""The Red Baron."" But what's left is charming, and very engagingly animated. I actually laughed out loud at some of the clever bits. There was something about seeing the actual Snoopy, as opposed to an adult in a white turtle neck, that made his parts a bit more effective. And including Woodstock, particularly during the song ""Snoopy,"" was an inspired touch.",1264636800,5,1523,4.494584837545126
666293,4,630348364X,"I love this musical, so naturally getting this DVD was a no brainer.  While the content is taken from the Broadway musical, the animation and the voices are in keeping with the Peanuts TV specials and movies.  Translation?  They've got little kids and adequate animation.

But that's not a huge problem for me because I love what is here.  The emphasis seems to be on the songs with only a little bit of dialogue between them.  But since the musical is a collection of vignettes and not a complete story, that certainly works.

And I love some of the songs here.  ""T-E-A-M"" is funny and sad.  ""Book Report,"" which finds the gang attempting to write a report on Peter Rabbit, and ""Glee Club,"" which presents a hilarious but not necessarily harmonious take on ""Home on the Range"" provide the best laughs.

With the emphasis being on the songs, many of the other bits get cut or left out.  There is one section that deals with Valentine's Day.  And they've got Charlie Brown's classic monologue about lunch time.  But I do wonder why they left out Snoopy's fight with the Red Barron.

Speaking of Snoopy, he does get a voice here.  No, he doesn't talk to the kids, but he does sing his two classics from the show, ""Snoopy"" and ""Suppertime.""

The DVD only contains this 48 minute special.  Seems like they could have put something else on here.  The 15 minute documentary on the musical and how it became a special is a little too short and scattered to truly tell us much, but there are a few interesting nuggets in there.

Personally, I would love to get a live action version of the show, preferably from after the revival so we can get my favorite song.  But until that happens, this will certainly entertain.",1264636800,20,1709,4.540983606557377

The last song in Snoopy the Musical Just One Person always makes me sad but in this special the last song Happiness always makes me happy. I love the songs but I only wish I could find the music for the TV special and not the Broadway version. My favorite is the Home on the Range song when everyone is yelling at each other it's so funny to watch. I think Robert Towers does a great Snoopy voice. Great special and I really enjoy it.

666296,1,630348364X,"We rented this for our 5-year old niece from the library, as she likes the peanuts cartoons (race for your life, a boy named charlie brown, Great pumpkin, easter beagle, etc).  I had no idea it was a broadway musical.  My niece just sat there staring at the TV, chagrined.  A few minutes passed and it couldn't even hold her attention anymore.  I gave it an honest try but after 15 grueling and torturous minutes of cheesy song numbers and smarmy antics, I turned it off - my niece didn't even protest (normally she would throw a fit).

I'll admit part of it was my fault, as I assumed it was a plot-driven cartoon like all the others.  But hearing the peanuts gang belt out 'heartfelt' tunes like they were in a junior high talent show just didn't feel right - it just didn't seem to fit their characters.

Yes I am aware that there have been various musicals, a couple of which I've seen (""Flash Beagle"" at Knotts, as well as ""Snoopy"" on stage) - none of them really did it for me (I saw these when I was younger).
