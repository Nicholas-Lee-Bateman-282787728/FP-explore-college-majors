8318242,4,B001LJMAJS,I thought this was a pretty good movie. Actually my brother in law worked on this movie. He didn't have much of a budget. He had a lot of help from dedicated friends. I will watch this movie again.,1347321600,,197,4.076923076923077
8318243,1,B001LJMAJS,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and believe me, I've seen quite a few. It's like watching a TROMA movie without the gore, POLICE ACADEMY, and a MEXICAN SOAP at the same time. I think I can act better than the so called actors in this ""film"". You'll be better off watching a Robert Rodriguez film. Don't buy, don't rent it, don't even download it!!!",1250640000,,364,4.2898550724637685
8318244,2,B001LJMAJS,"I was recommended this title by several people who prefer independent movies to the stuff that Hollywood churns out on a regular basis.

Having watched this twice, I am not convinved that I am watching the same movie as those who recommended it.

Yes, given the minute budget, and the care and attention that was obviously lavished upon it, it is a ""good"" movie.

Having said that, I prefer to use other criteria when judging whether or not a film is a success in my terms of understanding.

The plot jumps around and can oft-times be distracting and disjointed. It is not clear where the characters fit in with each other or how they even came to be together and even though enlightenment is achieved in this regard at the conclusion of the film it does rather leave an unsatisfactory taste in the mouth. Some of the storyline is discontinuous and never fully explained how certain things happen as they did when they are clearly not coincidental.

It is hard to flesh out some of the personalities of the characters involved who seem frequently two rather than three dimensional. The dialogue is not the greatest in the world which makes the conclusion even more dislocated given the explanatory nature of the scene.

As an advertisement of the skills of the production and direction involved, it will get some serious attention as the relative success of such a low budget production has been hailed throughout the industry. One can only hope that with a bigger budget and facilities, we shall se a more worthy film in the future.",1236729600,2,1533,4.722846441947565
8318245,4,B001LJMAJS,This is a great independent movie.  It kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Who was really playing who for a fool. Phil Idrissi is awesome in this movie.  I hope this brings him great parts in high budget movies.  Worth the buy for your collection.,1235088000,,261,4.395833333333333
8318246,4,B001LJMAJS,"This movie stands alone. The story keeps your intreats even with the lack of high priced effects. I love the twists in the plot, and character development. Way above my expectations. I can't believe it was made with only $7,000. Imagine what this guy could do with a Hollywood budget? I look forward to seeing more from Suarez.",1234742400,,327,4.655172413793103
8318247,3,B001LJMAJS,"I just recently rented this movie at my local Blockbuster. I had a extremely hard time with the story line. The plot seemed disconnected and the build up between characters were poorly developed. I wanted to see something more complete. It had all the right elements, it just fell flat in the production.
  It is rather extraordinary to have a movie product at a $7000, but how much better would it of been if it had a proper independent budget of $1,000,000? I hope the actors, especially the leading lady will find even greater avenues for the acting ability to be more widely appreciated. If anything get this movie for Kristen Nedopak's preformance.",1233705600,,653,4.769911504424779
8318248,4,B001LJMAJS,"This film is one of the $7,000 wonders, like: El Mariachi and Primer, shot in Super 16mm during a cold rainy Seattle winter. Written by Joseph D. Olson, The Scratch is an off-beat crime caper concerning a small private investigation firm and ghosts of the past catching up to one of the main characters.

The director, Jorge Suarez, had the good fortune to meet Martin Scorsese at a pre-Oscars party. After hearing the young director's tale about making his film on a shoe string, Mr. Scorsese was intrigued and said he would see the film. After watching it, he called the the young director to give him his impressions, he likened it to Stanley Kubrick's early film: Killer's Kiss.

If you like quirky independent films, try The Scratch.",1232064000,,738,4.7578125
