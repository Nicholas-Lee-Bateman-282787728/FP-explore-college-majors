1334319,5,B00003TKEJ,"Finally a soft core film fans can truely enjoy! Too many hard core and soft core films rely on canned music and quick disolves. Like the Blair Witch Project, The Erotic Witch is photographed and works on the same  voyeuristic levels. The Erotic Witch is one of those special movies that  the sex scenes themselves dictate the pacing, climax and stucture of the  scenes. The tent scene is one of the best lesbian scenes I have seen in  years. Darian Caine and Katie Kean are Goddesses! Very well acted and  brilliantly directed by John Bacchus who has a great sense of the  sensitivity and warmth of lesbian sex.  Buy this movie immediately!  You  will not be dissappointed!",951868800,26,673,4.683760683760684
1334320,1,B00003TKEJ,"This movie is dreadful. There is no chemistry between the actors whatsoever. The women have nice heads, but, bad implants. They look like they were dragged off the stage of your local go-go bar. I watched this  movie once, now the spiders have a new home on my shelf! As a lifelong fan  of G-G...my advice to everyone...SAVE YOUR DOUGH!",951264000,4,336,4.583333333333333
1334361,4,B00003TKEJ,"I think the concept of this Blair Witch spoof is quite good, actually.  Three young ladies head off into the woods of ""Bacchusville, New Jersey"" in search of the Erotic Witch.  As the story goes, over a century ago the Erotic Witch basically slept with every man in town and was banished deep into the woods (presumably by the men's wives and girlfriends, I imagine); ever since, many people have reported experiencing intense feelings of eroticism when venturing into those woods.  This film actually follows the Blair Witch outline fairly closely.  First we see the gang preparing for the camping trip, then we hear stories from some spoofalicious Bacchusville townsfolk, and then we head off into the woods equipped with camcorders.  Only one of the girls actually believes in the Erotic Witch, but certain ""objects"" mysteriously left near their camping sites do seem to have a direct relation to the fabled lady of promiscuity.  There is a lot of arguing between the girls, mysterious sounds in the night that compel the girls to leave the tent (albeit far from warmly dressed) and look around, and a couple of the girls have a tendency to wander off by themselves (where they are known to do some very interesting things).
Let's not kid ourselves here; while this is a pretty funny spoof of The Blair Witch Project, The Erotic Witch Project is basically a soft porn movie.  My personal favorite of the girls (Darian Caine) is pretty darn erotic before the trip even begins (witness the tape she makes for her boyfriend) but the other two get pretty erotic themselves once they get out in the haunted woods together.  These girls go significantly past R rated stuff here (by themselves as well as with each other), so be aware of this before you decide to watch and/or buy it.  It's far from ""raunchy"" but it is definitely for mature audiences only.
There is only one aspect of this film that I really dislike.  For some reason, the plot features an escaped gorilla loose in the woods.  The guy in the ape suit does sneak up at one point and do some very appreciated repositioning of a neglected camcorder on the ground, but other than this one good deed he annoys the heck out of me.  As for the movie's end, it actually does pay homage in one sense to that of The Blair Witch Project, but, as should be obvious, The Erotic Witch Project goes out with a bang quite different from that of the film it is spoofing.",1043798400,3,2417,4.634660421545667
1334362,3,B00003TKEJ,"In the midst of the popularity of The Blair Witch Project, it was inevitable that such a pop phenomenon would come to inspire so many parodies.  Unsurprisingly, one such spoof took the soft core path, and it's probably the most popular of the bunch.
Take the original plot, make it three young women instead of two guys and a girl, and put them off to the woods in the search of the legendary erotic witch and you've got the (very) basic plot for The Erotic Witch Project.  Of course, these three ladies come under the influence of the erotic witch and end up getting into all sorts of lesbian encounters with one another.
Since this is a softcore film, this should be reviewed on an entirely different basis than the average movie.  After all, things such as acting, writing, and competent direction don't matter here.  All you need to see are three attractive women who display lots of skin and get it on with one another.  Even at that, it's hardly perfect, but it'll probably work up a quick fix for those who like this sort of thing (being a guy, I do like this sort of thing).
The three women on hand are Katie Keane (who now seems to go by the name Laurie Wallace, but I'll stick with the name Keane for the review), a blonde; Victoria Vega, a brunette; and Darian Caine, who has dark hair.  Keane is easily the most physically attractive of the lot (which is nice considering she spends the entire last half-hour wandering around in a forest without any clothes on) and also displays the most acting ability (or maybe a better way to put it would be more enthusiasm than both Vega and Caine combined).  She gets in at least two classic moments, the first is when she and Vega are under the spell of the erotic witch and she complains about being nude on video while Vega strips her clothes off one-by-one.  The second is probably the most famous scene in the entire movie, a three-minute long parody of Heather Donahue's tearful ""I'm so sorry"" speech, except Keane happens to be fondling her  bare breast for the entire segment.
The Erotic Witch Project most definitely could have done without the guy running around in a gorilla suit who occasionally makes grunting noises during the lesbian scenes.  And hey, it probably could have even done without Darian Caine, whose constant griping and raspy voice are more annoying than sexy.  Still, this is an amusing, sexy softcore flick that Blair Witch haters will probably find up their alley.",1031270400,6,2448,4.604597701149426
1334363,1,B00003TKEJ,"No need to go into the premise of this spin off unless you are someone that lives in a paper bag. It's movies like this that makes me re-iterate my promise never to buy a DVD unless I see the movie first.
Not only is it boring, but, when I guess, some guy in a gorilla suit came sneaking out of the woods, about half way through the movie, smelling underwear and then chasing after the girls, I just had to turn the movie off. I mean this movie now takes the place of 'Time Bandits'as the worst thing I have ever seen and could not bear to finish .....
This IS of course a lesbian movie since the three main players are girls. None of the scenes are very erotic unless you call getting into a tent, turn off the light, and then the unforgettable phrase of 'I'm horny' beig uttered as erotic. Darn I don't even thinks it rates a porno label.
To add insult to injury the director doesn't even hide the fact that in one of the numerous fake oral scenes, the girls don't even touch each other since they cover the object of their desire with their hand and just basically licking their own fingers ... Now there was a first for me in any soft porn movie I've ever seen ...
Thats great, that money on a DVD to watch someone licking their own fingers ....
Save your money ....",984700800,5,1270,4.166666666666667
1334364,3,B00003TKEJ,"It was bound to happen, wasn't it? It was inevitable that we would see numerous ""Blair Witch Project"" imitators and parodies in the aftermath of the most successful indie flick ever, but how were we to know that one of the first ones out of the gates would be so close to hardcore lesbian porn?
""The Erotic Witch Project"" follows a setup roughly the same as its inspiration. Katie Keane (taking on the Heather Donahue role as the obsessed documentarian) and her two friends Darian Caine and Victoria Vega decide to hike into the woods, armed with two camcorders, to shoot a documentary about a local legend: the Erotic Witch. Before their steamy adventures begin, they interview some townsfolk about the legend, and we learn that the Erotic Witch has the uncanny power to make people extremely horny. Oh, beware!
Once the girls get into the woods, the movie becomes a nonstop charade of nudity and lesbian sex. Yes, this title from Seduction Cinema (the erotic division of E.I. Independent Cinema) delivers pretty much what it promises. The girl-on-girl action is more explicit than the softcore romps on late-night cable -- stopping just short of hardcore, in fact. The only gripes I have about the sex scenes is that the lighting is a bit harsh, and the girls don't appear to be truly enjoying themselves. For instance, whenever the girls start to kiss, one of them quickly pulls away -- to explore a more private region of her partner's body, no less. The girls are nice to look at (Katie Keane especially), even if the lighting isn't very flattering.
Director John Bacchus tried to make this a funny spoof of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but he's less successful in this area. Instead of the girls finding piles of rocks outside of their tent the morning after a passionate lesbian encounter, they find dildos and porn mags. Instead of weird stick figures in the trees, there is -- gasp! -- a blowup doll. And of course, someone steals their clothes in the middle of the night, so near the end they're all pretty much walking around the woods naked.
One scene in which the parody does actually work is the one that spoofs Heather's whispered confession to the video camera. ""I'm so scared,"" Katie says, ""and I'm so horny at the same time."" They got the framing right in this one (almost just like its counterpart scene in ""The Blair Witch""), and Katie does a good job with her speech -- then she starts fondling her breasts, of course. If only the rest of the movie had been this inspired.",981417600,9,2491,4.676537585421412
1334365,5,B00003TKEJ,"THE EROTIC WITCH PROJECT is a soft-pornographic spoof on the hyped up, but let-down film THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. In this very funny, and very sensual film: three college co-ed's go into the woods of a small town to videotape and document there search for the legendary Erotic Witch. There clothes are stolen during the night, they walk around naked, they find blow up dolls hanging from trees, they get 'urges' to sexually explore each other's bodies. This is without a doubt, a recommendation for people who like parodies and erotica.",979948800,,536,4.9010989010989015
1334366,4,B00003TKEJ,"This movie is a great spoof. Anyone who has seen the Blair Witch Project should definetly see this. Even if you have not seen the BWP, check this movie out. I laughed a lot during this movie and so did my friends. The  extra footage is cool as well. All-in-all, a must see.",958435200,,273,4.150943396226415
1334367,5,B00003TKEJ,"While most ""erotic"" films tend to be steeped in intellectualism that obscures the main purpose of an erotic film, EWP escapes all of that.  As a knock-off of the awful film The Blair Witch Project, this movie takes  a dead subject and breathes new life into it.  The women in this movie are  very attractive, and (if my assumption is correct) are not professional  adult entertainers.  This is refreshing.  With all of the artificial,  plastic Barbie-wannabes out there, this is a welcome departure.  Some of  the other reviews may not have seen the humor in this show, but I sure did.  In addition to being extremely arousing, I also found myself chuckling  quite a bit at the jokes throughout.  One of the really nice touches was  that these women looked exactly like a lot of the sorority girls I went to  college with in the early 90s.  If they weren't really amateur sorority  girls, then they did a VERY GOOD job acting the part.  My only question  is... WHY IS THIS MOVIE RATED R?  There were plenty of scenes in the  movie that warranted a solid X.  I've never seen one hollywood release with  an R (or even an NC17) that was allowed to show as much skin as this one!  I highly recommend this film to fans of amateur adult movies.",957571200,,1238,4.472972972972973
1334368,1,B00003TKEJ,"My wife and I watched the Blair Witch Project and the Erotic Witch Project back to back. The BWP was pretty good for a student film, but I did not really see what all the fuss was about. EWP was just awful! I had read some  positive reviews on the web of this ""soft-core parody"", so I  thought I would do these films as a double feature. The idea had potential  for campy eroticism, but outside of one scene (the one taken from BWP in  which the hysterical woman confesses to the camera that it is all her  fault), I found nothing especially arousing, and only a few moments of  effective humor.
What really annoyed me was the dialogue. These women,  though attractive (in an artificially enhanced kind of way), seemed to be  making it up as they went along, with the director off camera saying things  like ""yeah, that's good, now take of your blouse and say that five  more times, only in a whinier voice!"" By the way, another  ""sex-parody"", the Bare Wench Project sounds even worse and I for  one will not be watching a triple feature.",956534400,2,1038,4.405263157894737
1334369,4,B00003TKEJ,"Well, as you know this movie is based on the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"".  But in this case three geourgous girls wants to know more about the erotic witch.  That witch is supposed to give sexual power and  turns people eager to have sex.
If you want to see a sex lesbian  comedy, this is the right movie.  If you want some with girls and boys,  forget it.",955929600,2,360,4.144927536231884

This'Erotic'version follows the same plot path but with an erotic twist although the building is missing at the end =)The 3'actresses'in this movie look gorgeous! If you  liked Blair Witch Project and you're into lesbian action then this is THE  movie you DON'T wanna miss out! It's not XXX but it comes close. The image  on the DVD is crystal-clear,as if you'd just pulled it out of your own  camcorder but the sound is mono though.

7919600,3,B00003TKEJ,"It's actually a fairly fun movie.  I remember seeing the original VHS version when it came out in 1999, and the main difference I noticed with this ""collector's"" edition is that Darian Caine's hot masturbation scene was completely removed!  That aside, there are some nice softcore lesbian scenes, the exceptionally fine Katie Keane, and the always-enthusiastic Darian Caine.

The other ""minus"" as far as the DVD goes is the crispness of the image-- it really shows how crappy the lighting & makeup were on this set.  All the girls have very spotty, blotchy tans that would look perfectly fine in a dimly lit strip club, but under harsh lighting and unforgiving videotape, make the girls look like strips of beef jerky.",1143072000,3,719,4.917355371900826
7919601,2,B00003TKEJ,"Legend has it, that many years ago, a woman of the village was so lascivious, that every man, woman, child and animal in the village were at risk for her attentions. The Villagers eventually became so outraged, that they took this woman, known as the Erotic Witch, deep into the forest, never to be seen or heard from again.

Stories circulated for years thereafter, that anyone that went into the same woods felt strange, unnatural compulsions. The film follows three college girls as they venture into these haunted woods to debunk the legend, however they find themselves inexorably drawn into licentious, perverted behavior, while still denying the existence of the Erotic Witch.

Conclusion

Whether it was purposeful or not, the sexual interplay was amateurish, dispassionate and strictly girl on girl, not exactly my forte. Of the three girls, I thought only one, Kate, was attractive and even with her, you could see scars on the underside of her breasts (boob job) and light stretch marks on her upper thighs. The acting was soso and the story was stupid. Maybe it was meant to be that way, but I still didn't like the movie.",1131408000,5,1134,4.865284974093265
