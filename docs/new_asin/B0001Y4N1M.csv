8018122,5,B0001Y4N1M,I bought this only for Rosie's Walk which is another Pat Hutchins favorite! Harry the Dirty a Dog was cute and my grandson enjoyed it.,1380931200,,134,4.4
8018123,2,B0001Y4N1M,"Like the previous reviewer, we found upon purchase that the menu on one of the discs does not work. The problem for us is that the malfunctioning disc contains the title story, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, which was the reason that we bought the collection. Numerous calls to Scholastic produced no satisfaction; in fact, it seemed to me that not only was the company not interested in hearing that they had released a defective product, they did not seem the least bit interested in fixing the problem. After this experience, I cannot imagine every purchasing another product manufactured by this company again.",1279238400,,608,4.970588235294118
8018124,5,B0001Y4N1M,"I am a huge fan of the Scholastic Storybook DVD's.  I love that you can pick the story you want and watch it.  The stories are read wonderfully and the video or pictures make the story even more interesting.  I love reading my kids or students a story and then letting them watch the story on the DVD.  This particular set has some of my favorite stories on it!  It has 19 total stories!  The best being the video of Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.  It is such a catchy song sung to the words in the book.  The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom DVD includes some other great stories on it; Trashy Town, Rosie's Walk, The caterpillar and the Polliwog, and Joey Runs Away are all excellent stories.  The second DVD in the set is full of great stories too.  Harry the Dirty Dog is a favorite and the best part of this DVD is that it contains Officer Buckle and Gloria!  The third DVD is great for Back to School Time with Miss Nelson has a Field Day and Miss Nelson is Back.  As a parent and educator, I recommend the scholastic DVD's all the time and buy them as gifts. A great gift idea is to purchase a book to match one of the DVD's.  Give the book along with the DVD!",1249689600,2,1152,4.112107623318385
8018125,3,B0001Y4N1M,"We bought this DVD for the Harry the Dirty Dog cartoon and we are happy with that one and the others on the DVD. The problem is with the DVD menu system on one of the discs. On our older (Go Video) player, the menu will not come up. The disc starts playing at the beginning of one of the special features and when you try to get to the main menu, it goes right back to the special feature. We tried exchanging discs, but the new one did the same thing. This also happened on a couple of the other DVD's in the Scholastic series. The do play fine on our DVD recorder, but not on our older player.",1219622400,,595,3.966666666666667
