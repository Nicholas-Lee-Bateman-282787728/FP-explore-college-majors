8302414,5,B001FRCCPS,How this man never won a Ballon d'Or is a crime. Jamie Carragher is still looking for his jock on that goal in '04 where Henry made him corkscrew himself into the ground.,1396224000,,170,4.181818181818182
8302415,5,B001FRCCPS,Thierry Henry is the best soccer player. This book looks awesome to tell about this legend. TH 14 deserve glorification.,1376956800,,120,5.05
8302416,5,B001FRCCPS,"If you are a football fan and weren't lucky enough to see this guy play in his prime, then buy this DVD. Arsenal's highest ever scorer must be a special football player.",1333497600,,169,4.3125
8302417,5,B001FRCCPS,"I didn't see all of thierry henry's amazing arsenal run, but i did see alot of the latter years. He's always been my favorite player, and this dvd illustrates that to a tee. Great interviews with announcers, past and present teammates and from the man himself. Alot like gretzky, henry did all this with hardly any enemies. A humble athlete on and off the field. I'm not sure how long it will take another player to topple his staggering 226 all-time goals for arsenal, but in the mean time, you can see all of them here. Another great part of henry was his connection to the fans. And also his celebrations showed just how much he loved the team he played for. HENRY = LEGEND!!!!!!!!",1300060800,,684,4.48
