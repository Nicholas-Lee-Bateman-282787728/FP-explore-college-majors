8708566,5,B00UW1YXW8,"One of my goals in life was to read the Shakespeare plays.  Then I found this DVD set.  Don't call me lazy yet.  This excellent set brings out the idea that Shakespeare can be read in different ways depending on interpretation. So I got various interpretations from each of the narrators and the play they each presented.  I would never have gotten those rich perspectives on my own.  So unless you're a student of Shakespeare, this is an extremely great set for understanding what the big deal about Shakespeare is.",1501804800,4,516,4.688888888888889

8708568,5,B00UW1YXW8,"These series of commentaries on a selection of Shakespeare's plays are very much worth the time they take to watch and the money they cost.
