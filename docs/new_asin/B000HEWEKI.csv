Admittedly, I haven't watched the instructional part since I'm already a seasoned dancer.  I wish Virginia would make a choreo dvd for her Harramt Ahebak performance.  Love it!",1503187200,,331,4.466666666666667

8139224,3,B000HEWEKI,"I'm in NY, I rented this at Blockbust*r online. This is for true beginners. There is no workout, it's more like a class.
Victoria is alone on a simple set with rug floor. The music is Eastern & played very low.
You get a warm up/stretch/contractions, learn posture, arms/hands, slides/circles, camels/undulations, hip drops/lifts, figure 8s, 2 shimmies & twists, grapevine, simple Egyptian steps, simple turn.
Her teaching style has the same info, or slightly less then Neena & Veena, Neon, etc. She teaches very slow & patiently &  a bit on the boring side.
The performance at the end was very nice. Only simple moves, she is pretty fluid & gets into the music, but seems to be too careful sometimes & other times a bit sloppy in technique.

8139225,5,B000HEWEKI,"I have always been so impressed and envious of Virginia's technique. Everything is so clear, perfect and full of expression. I have been lucky enough to attend a couple of her workshops and was amazed at how much I improved after studying briefly with her.

The DVD is a must have for anyone who is just learning bellydance or who wants killer technique. Virginia is so clear and detailed in her explanations. The video is beautifully made and shows all of her movements very well. Her personality is warm and inspiring as she breaks down all the movements for the viewer. The performance at the end is fantastic.",1164844800,8,613,4.675925925925926
