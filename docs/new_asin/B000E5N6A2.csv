2494328,5,B000E5N6A2,"Robert Englund plays the homocidal Mayor of a southern town ""George W."" Buckman, who presides over a weekend of mayhem at the expense of northern visitors unlucky enough to wander into the town's annual ""festival"".

Lots of beautiful people being killed in ways never before seen on screen.  More a comedy than a horror film.

2494329,5,B000E5N6A2,"My selection for this year's Best Horror Film is a dark horse, 2001 MANIACS, a remake of a 1964 horror film that courted controversy. While sticking to the original story, the movie declines to pontificate: messages (racism, jingoism) are diluted within a six-pack libation. Circumventing the original, director Tim Sullivan cues the viscera not as the film's raison d'etre but instead yields to Tex Avery. Sure, there's entrails and decapitations, but Sullivan-who could have leaned on today's technology for clinical realism-opts to tail the Road Runner: 2001 MANIACS is a hybrid of Grand Guignol, ersatz Tennessee Williams and drive-in movie. Unlike the already fossilized movies of last summer, Sullivan forfeits formula and reinvents ""splatter."" Behind the film's cheerful sadism, and the cynical fade-out, there's a suggestion Pleasant Valley's ghosts will never be exorcised-some of them, in fact, have crossed over to the Six O'clock News.",1137888000,10,947,5.537931034482758

2494646,4,B000E5N6A2,"The first time I saw this film, I loved it. The second time not so much, it has too much sex and not enough gore. I think horror movies would be better with less sex, full full-frontal nudity, that's nice, but remember we're watching to see people die and get tortured, not to watch sex.

I do love the ending (spoiler alert), love the sheriff lecturing the Yankees that that area is sacred ground, and that that town was burned by Sherman's troops. There hasn't been enough movies about the horrible things the Yankees did when they invaded the South. So this horror movie is a nice tale of revenge, they were wronged, and now they get to have revenge.

It's just a hoot, and it's got so many clever kills, and priceless dialogue.

2494776,2,B000E5N6A2,"2001 Maniacs (Tim Sullivan, 2005)

2001 Maniacs, which despite is name pointing to it being a sequel is actually a remake of Herschell Gordon Lewis' microbudget 1964 gore-film classic Two Thousand Maniacs!, actually does have a few moments of genuine, albeit mean-spirited, comedy. In other words, I don't seem to hate it quite as much as most people who pour bile over it on the IMDB boards do. Which still doesn't make it timeless cinema, to be sure, but I don't think you will feel you've completely wasted the hour and a half (the way you would with something like Vile or Train, for example).

Plot: after a useless (and you know it's useless) intro that seems to exist only to give Peter Stormare a cameo, a trio of dunderheaded college students head off for spring break--Anderson (Hellraiser: Revelations' Jay Gillespie), Cory (Old School's Matthew Carey), and Nelson (Raspberry and Lavender's Dylan Edrington). On the way down, they stop at an out-of-the-way gas station and bump into the impossibly beautiful Kat (Little Athens' Gina Marie Heekin) and Joey (The Watch's Marla Malcolm), heading the same way with Ricky (Sorority Boys' Brian Gross). Nelson and Joey make plans to get together in Daytona Beach, little knowing that neither car is going to make it there--they follow a detour and end up in the small Southern town of Pleasant Valley, run by genial Mayor Buckman (Robert Englund), who seems to take ""the South's gonna rise again"" just a little too seriously. Things get tense when another pair on a motorcycle follow the detour--Malcolm (Conspiracy Theory's Mushond Lee), an African-American, and his Chinese girlfriend Leah (Amazing Race contestant Bianca Smith). Mayor Buckman invites the motley crew to stick around for their annual jamboree, which culminates in a massive barbecue; while most of them are apprehensive, Anderson--the only one of the bunch born in the south (he is, he mentions to the mayor, South Carolina born and bred)--convinces the group that his upbringing in the Suthun niceties will get them all through and out the other side. It should not be a spoiler to say that this is not, in fact, the case.

It's dumb, but come on, the original was dumb, too, so you can't really dock points for that. And like I said, the movie does have some moments of genuine comedy (the semi-running gag with the town minstrels [played by producer Scott Spiegel and actual rockabilly singer Johnny Legend] following Malcolm around and serenading him culminates with the movie's best punchline--a complete anachronism, but so's most of the second half of the soundtrack). On the other hand, well, the original was dumb, so why are you remaking it in the first place? It's stupid and predictable, but reasonably well-made, amps up the gore and T&A factors from the original (Lewis, of course, was pushing envelopes, while Sullivan is simply pandering to the crowd), and has reasonable performances from the principals especially Englund and female lead Lin Shaye (Insidious); if you have nothing better to do on a Saturday night, this isn't the worst thing you could dial up on Netflix. * ",1372723200,,3116,4.986538461538461

I wonder how truly talented actors who struggle in new York City & LA that have the right training can't find work, but these people are employed. How?

No doubt the lemmings and those that salivate at sub par entertainment will find this a giant mouthful. But that isn't surprising. When you go to an all you can eat Buffet, what kind of people will be there each and every time you go?

Robert Englund, is that his name, that fool of a two bit actor who wore a glove of knives and scratched his way to failure. Over-acting isn't any kind of logical way to describe not only Englund, but the entire lot of actors in this truly abysmal work of horror.

Their welcoming hosts treat them to a ton of fun and festivities, but little do they know that they are about to become the main course at the annual feast! Tim Sullivan strikes B-movie gold with this updated version of the Herschell Gordon Lewis gore classic. While the performances and humor are often crude, they play into the silly, light-hearted tone and add to the overall charm of the picture. Many of the gags and over-the-top murders have been recreated from the original, while Sullivan and company come up with plenty of bloody new ways to maim and dismember the misguided teens (including a horse-quartering, an acid-chugging competition, a spear enema, and other gooey deaths). The incredible amount of splatter is more than enough to please most Slasher fans, and is even enough to make The Godfather of Gore, himself, proud. Robert Englund is right at home in his role as the jubilant Mayor Buckman, creating one of his more memorable performances in years. 2001 MANIACS is an enjoyable guilty pleasure that holds to its cheesy roots in gore cinema.

It has that cheesy yet amusing gore factor that keeps your eyes open ready to witness the next over the top scene. Robert Englund does a fine job portraying ""Mayor Buckman"".Having seen the sequel first, I must say this one is better. The budget was obviously higher and the acting from the lesser knowns I'd say is on the average scale. Robert Englund really steals the spotlight.

2494841,3,B000E5N6A2,"Well, let's say I didn't appreciate the original  2000 Maniacs  which this movie is supposed to be a remake. There was not enough gore (and since mr. Lewis has been credited as being the ""gore king"", that's a serious matter), so I guessed `t was easy task to do better, even with a remake. But I went disappointed even this time. Let's say than that I don't enjoy a horror movie if there's not suspense and you're not made jump off your chair: all the rest, gore, soundtrack, nudity, story, is just marginal. And here I felt any thrill or scare at all: all killings were predictable and left nothing to guess to you about the possible survivors. Moreover, it is in the long line of teen-agers-slasher-movie which has given so many infamous titles and is apparently unable to generate anything worth the ticket since decades. I can anyway praise the fx, the great southern accent (I cannot tell from which State, maybe Georgia or S.Carolina: if anybody can tell me, thankee), some funny character and situation and the ending, which was totally unexpected, although later made me angry as physically impossible (as other killing modalities in the rest of the movie: why directors often handle his public as if composed by mongoloids?). I'm unsure if recommending it for being watched at least once, or possibly save your time for something better. It's a matter of what do you expect from a good horror movie.",1249171200,,1408,4.742857142857143

2494843,2,B000E5N6A2,"While scanning through some late night tv in search b we stumbled across 2001 Maniacs starring Robert Englund. Being in the mood for a really horrible film we figured how could it get any worse then a remake where Freddy Kruger plays a cannibal redneck? What was so attractive about this one was the hillbilly horror concept. Cracking up at the expense of some good old boys has been an old past-time of ours dating back to 93. Maybe it was all the years of watching episodes of cops where hicks would hide in a garbage can or under their child's kiddie pool to escape the police. Who could forget the guy that huffed gold spray paint? That was really what pushed us over the edge to sit through this one. No matter how bad it would get there would have to be some cheap laughs ultimately earning the film a star or 2. And we presumed correctly.

This one starts off with 3 of the biggest tools known to man as they set off on a trip to Florida for spring break. We were actually hoping the car would fly off a cliff within the first 10 minutes but thats just wishful thinking. The 3 cool cats stop into a gas station somewhere down South where they run into a car with 2 girls and a gay kid who are also on there way to Florida. These guys pull out some lines to seduce the ladies and it somehow seems to work even though they couldn't smooth a sheet if they had a hot dame...I lost my train of thought. Anyway they plan to all get together in FL and get back on the dusty trail. As they drive they come up to a detour sign and wind up in the town of Pleasant Valley where they are met by a whole mess of hicks led by Mayor Buckman (Englund). Mayor Buckman insists they stick around for a huge annual festival and BBQ called called Guts and Glory Jubilee. While he's working on the guys the car with the girls shows up along with a black guy on a motorcycle with his Chinese girlfriend. As the racial slurs incur there were enough laughs to earn 1 of the 2 stars. Despite the creepiness of the towns people the gang of idiots decide to stay and are brought to their complimentary rooms.

Once they get settled in they begin to spend time with the imbred rednecks and come across some interesting characters. Our favorite had to be the kid who's girlfriend was a sheep. A few times in the film he's chasing the sheep around with his pants around his ankles (unfortunately the highlight of the film which earned it the 2nd star). There is a southern charmer for the ladies and a few sexy ladies for the 3 goons. This film is beyond predictable so you probably know where we're going with it. As the seduce the characters the killings begin. The film had to rely gore to capture some type of audience but even the gore was of poor quality. The blood looked like watered down strawberry jelly as the film begins to get really boring. The whole redneck theme lost it's luster after about 35 minutes. The remaining few guests are told they will be on the menu for the hillbilly cannibals and part of their rich heritage. Since the dawn of time they've been placing a fake detour sign up to get people to travel through so they could eat them. Now we are down to 2 survivors who are tied up and about to be gutted when Mayor Freddy Krueger offers the kid a way out. He says if he'll gut the chick they'll let him live allowing him to become part of Pleasant Valley in which he agrees. He approaches the girl with a clever in hand and, get ready you may not see this coming, turns on the hicks throwing a clever through one's chest. Wow couldn't see that coming. Now we have a final face off between Freddy and the kid. The kid wins by putting a fork up to the Mayors good eye where he says they are free to leave if he'll spare his eye. So off they go and stop by the local sheriff where they explain what happend to their friends and they go back to only find it's a graveyard. Somehow there was no Pleasant Valley anymore and now they look crazy. The sheriff takes off and so do they on the motorcycle. As they cruise on down the road the hog stops and you see there was a piece of barb wire spread along the highway decaptitating them and thankfully the credits roll.

This one is pretty much a solid waste of time. Even though we were looking for a crappy movie this one was much worse then expected. The redneck style jokes grew thin really fast and there wasn't much call it a good remake to a classic film. If you have the choice pass on this one.

2494845,2,B000E5N6A2,"A remake of legendary gore-meister Hershell Gordon-Lewis' 2000 Maniacs, 2001 Maniacs is sadly underwhelming, and disappointing.  I say this because I've heard just about nothing but good things about it since it's release, and upon finally viewing it, the film just fails to deliver.  The story is simple enough: a group of Northern college kids and some other travellers get detoured to the southern town of Pleasant Valley, which is run by a large number of Civil War enthusiasts.  Or so they think.  Turns out they're Union troops looking to avenge their Civil War deaths, by none other than eating whomever crosses their paths!  Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund stars as their leader Mayor Buckman, and steals many a scene here, but he isn't enough to save the film.  Sure there's decent amounts of blood, gore, and nudity; but 2001 Maniacs just comes off as sadly boring.  Die hard horror fans may find some level of enjoyment with 2001 Maniacs, while others will walk away feeling like they expected more.

2494883,5,B000E5N6A2,"When they told me that someone named Tim Sullivan wanted to remake Herschell Gordon Lewis's classic 1964 gross out ""Two Thousand Maniacs,"" I knew I needed to sit up and pay attention. Who is this Sullivan guy? And why does he think he has the stones to remake a classic H.G. Lewis pukefest? It takes a lot of gall to mess around with a Lewis flick. He is, after all, the Godfather of Gore, the guy that made all the blood and guts flicks we see today possible. You wouldn't have a ""Hostel"" without ""Blood Feast"" and ""The Wizard of Gore"". It was Lewis that made it possible to put eye gouging, arm tearing, and tongue ripping--to cite just a few examples--up on the silver screen for all to see. The effects rarely looked convincing, not on the zero budgets Lewis worked with, but the results had an impact on audiences. People loved the shock value, Lewis made money, and other filmmakers started using blood and guts. Unfortunately, as the years passed, Herschell Gordon Lewis quit making movies and drifted into obscurity. Then DVD arrived and introduced his work to a new audience. And then came the inevitable remake...

""2001 Maniacs"" starts by introducing us to a group of foul mouthed, obnoxious jerks known to horror aficionados as ""cannon fodder"". Yep, that's right. We don't have to care that much about these trashy young kids because we know that they exist solely to die painful, cruel, and bloody deaths. Spring Break bound students Anderson (Jay Gillespie), Cory (Matthew Carey), Nelson (Dylan Edrington) meet up with Ricky (Brian Gross), Joey (Marla Malcolm), Kat (Gina Marie Heekin), Malcolm (Mushond Lee), and his girlfriend Leah (Bianca Smith) when they get lost in the middle of Georgia. Yeah, they're going to Florida for fun and sun, but they ain't going to get there after receiving questionable directions from a hick gas station attendant (played by Travis Tritt). Instead, our heroes wind up in the little town of Pleasant Valley, and just in time to attend the Guts and Glory Jubilee. Oh yeah! The folks living in this town seem friendly, if not a little odd around the edges, but our Yankee visitors are dumber than a box of rocks and don't seem to sense the danger. Too bad for them. You see, Pleasant Valley has a grim little secret, a bloody and gory secret.

If you've seen Lewis's original film, you already know the secret of Pleasant Valley. It involves the Civil War and plenty of revenge against the hated Yankee invaders. And since our youngsters come from up North, they're going to experience Pleasant Valley's kindness up close and personal. Mayor Buckman (Robert Englund), his son Lester (Adam Robitel), Granny Boone (Lin Shaye), the adorable Peaches (Wendy Kremer), Harper Alexander (Giuseppe Andrews), and the other townsfolk are not about to let our guests leave town without a heaping dose of that famous Southern hospitality. A few examples are free room and board, lots of booze, and plenty of lovin' for both the boys and the girls. Other acts of kindness include drawing and quartering by horses, acid hidden in a moonshine jug, musical numbers, cannibalism, castration, crushing, kissing cousins, skewering, stabbing, and general all-around maiming of the human form. These Pleasant Valley folks sure know how to welcome visitors! At least when the bloodshed finally abates after the horrific conclusion to the Guts and Glory Jubilee, two of the kids escape to tell the world about the horrors they have witnessed. Or do they? One thing's for certain--there's a sequel coming soon to a grindhouse near you!

It's refreshing to see a remake of a classic horror film that really works. H.G. Lewis should really enjoy Sullivan's ""2001 Maniacs"". It's got everything the original had while adding new charms to the story. It's campy as all get out, it's got gore oozing out of every pore, and it's got black humor to spare. Even Lewis's music from the original makes an appearance here, as does the idea of a roving band of minstrels telling us what's happening through song. Sullivan goes above and beyond Lewis's original script, however, when he injects his version of Pleasant Valley with lots of politically incorrect killings and humor. Nothing is sacred in ""2001 Maniacs"" as the movie skewers everything from bestiality to race relations without pulling punches. About the only thing missing from the original film is the barrel with nails gag. You won't miss it too much, however, as plenty of other interesting stuff keeps you occupied. For example, casting Robert Englund and Lin Shaye as the two main baddies in Pleasant Valley was a stroke of genius. They camp it up with wild abandon. Then there's Christa Campbell as the Milk Maiden. Even Eli Roth shows up in a cameo instantly familiar to anyone who has watched ""Cabin Fever"".

The DVD version of ""2001 Maniacs,"" brought to us by the folks over at Lionsgate, is excellent. We get the uncut version of the film in pristine glory, an audition reel, an alternate opening with John Landis, a few deleted/extended scenes, a handful of trailers, an amusing making of featurette covering most aspects of the production, and a couple of audio commentaries. One of these commentaries features Robert Englund in all of his hilarious glory, so definitely give that one a listen. Yes sir, you can't go wrong picking up a copy of ""2001 Maniacs"" today. It's rude, it's crude, and it's an instant classic. I'm so happy Tim Sullivan made such a magnificent tribute to the great H.G. Lewis. I'm also hoping the sequel lives up to this film. And remember: The South Will Rise Again!",1169942400,2,5575,4.859095688748686
2494884,4,B000E5N6A2,"I'm a huge fan of the original Two Thousand Maniacs by HGL so I was a little nervous about the remake. I am happy to report that the new version actually IMPROVES on the original. This movie has a nice pedigree, with John Landis, HGL, David Friedman, and Eli Roth all having involvement in the making of the film. As far as the movie itself, it takes the same plot, sexes it up quite a bit with a liberal amount of toplessness on people you'd actually want to see nekkid, and amps up the gore from the already classic level of gore. It's absolutely disgusting, tasteless, and has very little redeemable value to the local PTA. In other words, you'll love it. There's a couple of missteps, such as an over-reliance on sheep sex jokes and a few over-acting southerners (HickiBilly, for instance). Overall, however, this is a MUST RENT for any fan of gore flicks, campy horror, or just plain fun.",1167091200,2,893,4.518518518518518

2494887,4,B000E5N6A2,"""2001 Maniacs"" is, in my opinion, the only type of horror movie that's been really, really hard to get right in the 2000s: the horror-comedy.  Everything else under the horror banner - monster movies, ghost stories, psychological thrillers, slash/carnage-type horrors, etc. - all of them have had a lot of great representatives in recent years, from all over the world.  There have been humorous moments in a number of horror greats - ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", the ""Final Destination"" series, ""Bruiser"", etc. - but almost all the attempts at full horror-comedies have, in my opinion, stalled - most of them would have been better picking one style or the other and maybe trying to inject little bits of the other instead of walking that line directly (I admit I haven't had a chance to see ""Slither"" yet, but that one does look promising).  ""2001 Maniacs"" is a huge success as a horror-comedy though, reminding one of greats like ""Re-Animator"" and ""Evil Dead 2"" that so gloriously plowed the fields of the outrageously bizarre.

  Three groups of young travellers - at least two of them heading off to a popular spring break destination - take the wrong detour and end up in a surreally odd town where it still seems to be the pre-Civil War old south, on the eve of a large annual festival, populated by characters ranging from the merely odd (sometimes likably so) to the truly disquieting.  The locals are familiar with cars and modern technology but just don't seem to have any; the travellers assume that this is all a tongue-in-cheek re-creation of the Old South, and are charmed enough by the overflowing hospitality of some of the town's residents (including its gregarious mayor - wickedly played by Robert Englund) that they decide to ditch their previous plans and accept the invitations to stay for the weekend and enjoy the festivities.  Wincing at but overlooking the truly tasteless parts of the 're-creation', they settle in to what looks to be a fun weekend for all - until things start to take on a creepier and more threatening tone...

  The talented cast turn what could have been really stupid, crude comedy into something that really flows with the film and just enhances its weird vibe.  Several of the characters, judging by their first moments in the movie, could have turned out so excessively unlikable as to be a drag on the movie, but that too is averted as you get to know them.  And Robert Englund is a global treasure - he plays this role to pefection - as he does with almost all his movies - and knows precisely what to bring to each moment.  ""2001 Maniacs"" is bloodily and inventively violent, unpredictably quirky, and sexy with enough exposure to keep both guy and girl viewers happy.  Well-made and unorthodox, it's a welcome addition to 2006's rich horror offerings.",1161734400,3,2799,4.79002079002079

Robert Englund played it up pretty good as Mayor Buckman, as did Lyn Shaye as Granny Boone. Not a smidgin of tension, but a lot of black humor that worked to varying degrees.

Ah, to be a glamorous movie star.  Ever wondered what that experience is like?  Do you dream of being able to sleep until nine or ten o'clock in the morning before you get up to start your day on the set?  Do you see yourself surrounded by bright lights and make-up artists in your warm trailer while they powder your nose and brush mascara through your eyelashes?  Do you think you merely press a button to summon a crewmember that will cater to your every need and drive you wherever you need to go?  Is that your idea of what it's like to be a movie star?

Forget it!!  Take all that preconceived fantasy and toss it into the trashcan.  For starters, extras were required to be on the set at six am for the days' filming. The principle actors were required to be there right behind us (many of them had been in makeup and wardrobe since four am.)  Since Westville was ""the set,"" this meant I had to wake up at three-thirty am to get into my ""costume,"" which were clothes I owned, (adhering to the strict instructions of gearing toward a ""period"" look, in this case the 1870's). I had to leave my house by four am for the 45-minute drive from Columbus to Westville.  Traffic was surprisingly sparse during the trip.

Upon arrival, I walked toward what appeared to be the entrance.  A man got out of his car and introduced himself as Rex.  We struck up a conversation, speculating about what events our day might hold.  A blonde woman in period costume joined us.  Rex, the blonde and I  wondered when we were going to be called in for casting.  Our speculation was interrupted by another extra walking by, stating there'd been an accident.  He was told that all extras should wait in their cars and the crew would call for us in about an hour.  As if on cue, an ambulance with lights flashing appeared on the horizon.  A few minutes later, we observed the paramedics loading someone on a stretcher into the ambulance to be rushed to Columbus.  After a lengthy wait, we took it upon ourselves to walk down to the extras area, where we were told to go to the staging area, the courthouse.

I quickly learned a background extra's life on the set is often tedious, sequestered on the set away from the principle actors, waiting sometimes for hours to hopefully be picked by the ""wranglers"" for a scene.  One of our wranglers, Maury jokingly said: ""Welcome to show business.""  As I shivered in the cool fall morning, I wished I'd brought a good book or a laptop computer so I could read, write or play solitaire while waiting.  Instead, I occupied the down time by talking to Rex and Hugh.

Rex and I were background extras, Hugh, a salaried actor, played the part of ""The Preacher;"" (don't get too excited, these actors get paid a flat rate of $100 per day.)  I found Rex and Hugh to be engaging individuals; I'm honored to have met them  On the morning of the second day of my extra duties, I was pleasantly surprised when Hugh greeted me and remembered my name.  I was scratching my head, attempting to remember his name.  I sheepishly admitted I was horrible at remembering names while shaking his hand then asked him to remind me of his name.

Movie making is a hectic process.  Extras stand around and wait; principle actors may re-read the script or hone their character portrayal.  Meanwhile the director, producers, sound technicians, and art directors huddle, plan and then hustle to get the scenery just right for the next shot.  For example, to set up a scene the camera people take lighting measurements and measure exact distances of the subjects to the camera to get the proper f-stop.  The continuity photographer takes still shots for later use to recall the exact position of the actors and props on the set.  This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to as long as an hour before filming.  Did you know it could take as long as two days of filming to get 10 minutes of on-screen footage?

Finally the time came for my participation.  I felt surprisingly calm, considering the fact I didn't have much experience on a movie set.  We were filming a scene in which the central characters arrive in the ghost town.  Wranglers placed us in the shot; I would equate it to a dance instructor showing us the ""right steps.""  The director gave us instructions, we were to jog and hop to the cars with big grins on our faces to greet our ""guests.""  I don't want to give away the movie, but the director set the mood for us by saying:  ""Imagine you haven't eaten dinner for a year and it just arrived.""  Laughter erupted among everyone on the set.

After three takes of this scene, we took a break.  I realized I was standing less than two feet away from Robert Englund, and waited patiently while he finished his conversation with another principle actor.  When he turned his back to the car he was leaning against, I quietly asked him for his autograph.  The only paper I had on me was my checkbook, and as I tore out a check he said:  ""Last one;""  (I have no idea just how many dozens of autographs he must have signed that day.) He scribbled ""Pay To Robert Englund"" on the back.  He handed it back to me while repeating what he'd written.  I laughed; he has a tremendous sense of humor and is surprisingly down to earth.  As filming wrapped on the first day, I overheard him say, to no one in particular ""...I could go for a pizza.""

In some cases, an actor doesn't interact off-camera with anyone on the set, except for certain key people.  The actor's not being stand-offish or stuck up; the actor is attempting to remain ""into character.""  This means that an actor will assume the persona of the character portrayed, and it's imperative that he or she remain in that mind-set (one can't very well portray a psychotic vampire while everyone's vying for an autograph!)  Interrupt an actor concentrating on his part; the mindset the actor is portraying evaporates.

It was amazing how quickly two extras' egos inflated disproportionately to their heads while working on this movie.  One got autographs from everyone on the set, attempted to get up close and personal with Mr. Englund, and became a featured extra.  I'm sure he thought because the director noticed his good looks and acting potential. A rumor going around the set suggested that the principle actors had joked about him during dinner Monday night.  One allegedly suggested a ""perfect"" scene in which the man pops out of a car's trunk, for the ""shock"" effect.  Another extra raised a commotion about how she felt she was being ""...treated like a dog..."" and how she had ""...real acting potential.""  She also questioned why the extras didn't get ""...hot food like the stars...not these [expletives deleted] wrapped sandwiches...""  This person was gently told by a wrangler that if she was ""...unhappy...you should reconsider your participation...""  In other words; if she didn't like it, hit the road.

Rex and I were enjoying some down time after lunch on Tuesday when two locals happened by.  One of them asked us if we were in the movie. We said our participation was during background crowd scenes.  The same man asked me for my autograph.  I laughed and said he could have it, but that and $2.00 might buy him a cup of coffee.  After the gentlemen left, Rex and I just looked at each other and broke out in laughter...""Welcome to show business,"" I echoed Maury's words.

I had no delusions going into this project; I remember thinking:  ""Hey, I'm an extra; a living prop.  I'm here for background decoration, nothing more, nothing less.""  I participated for the thrill of it.  I would definitely do it again.  It was fun, despite the cheesy snacks and tortilla chips, the way-too-sugary pink lemonade; the cold mornings, the yellow-jackets, the periods of standing statue-still in place on set.  Besides, obtaining that autograph was payment enough, even if I don't make it into the final film.

Tuesday's filming stopped at five-thirty pm - 10? hours after the day's production began. We were led towards the exit from the set and introduced  to the executive producer of the movie.  He said:  ""...movie making is a lot different than movie watching.  You all took a lot of abuse during these last two days, and on behalf of everyone here, I thank you all.  If any of you want to come back, we'll use you again.""

I'm the one who should be thanking them.  I'll be talking about these memories for the rest of my life.

As they say in show business; ""Cut! That's a wrap!""",1147564800,3,8739,4.584247901872176
2494924,5,B000E5N6A2,"Let me start by saying that Herschell Gordon Lewis' ""Blood Trilogy""(Blood Feast, 2000 Maniacs & Color Me Blood Red) are to me, the holy trinity of gore movies. There have been many great splatter movies since, but the style of those originals make them true genre classics.

  I don't like remakes. I don't think CG effects improve anything that was done perfectly the first time. ""2001 Maniacs"" is NO REMAKE!!

  ""2001 Maniacs"" picks up in the present day & breathes life (or death) into familiar characters that once haunted a Southern town in a DIFFERENT classic movie!

  This film had all the qualities I look for each time I see a new horror film & walk away disappointed. And to see a copy of Forrest Ackerman's ""Famous Monsters Of Filmland"" grace the cover of a movie screen, truly brought a tear to my eye!

  ""2001 Maniacs"" to me, is every bit as classic & great as ""2000 Maniacs"". I absolutely loved this movie. Thank you Tim Sullivan for making this movie & for proving to me that my vision of horror is true.",1146268800,4,1021,4.51912568306011
2494925,4,B000E5N6A2,"I've waited a long time to see 2001 Maniacs. I finally saw it and it was a good horror flick. It's not a masterpiece, but it is good horror fun.

In this remake to H.G. Lewis' Two-Thousand Maniacs, 3 students go on a spring break trip to the beach. When they take a detour, the land in a old southern town called Pleasant Valley. They'll all welcomed by the town's population, including the town's mayor, Mayor Buckman (Englund).

Also, 5 others enter Pleasant Valley and they're all welcome to stay for the BBQ. But what these visitors don't know is that they're going to be the the BBQ's main course.

The gore factor in this film is cool. Robert Englund does another good job playing a satistic villian. Eli Roth even appears in this film replaying the role in Cabin Fever.

2001 Maniacs does what it does for a horror film. It gives us the guts and glory. Also, the commentary with Robert Englund and Tim Sullivan is a very good commentary.",1146182400,2,944,4.47093023255814

From what I read it sounded pretty interesting and worth it being seen. I rented this movie and was fully satisfied and happy. This film was apparently a remake of an much older version. I have not seen this original and didn't know what to expect.

This is an extremely well made action, gory, and tension filled movie that keeps some kind of attractment of the audience on whether it be shocking and unbeliveable gore and violence or hot and steamy sex scenes. The story was great and the movie had no cheap or cheesy look or feel to it at all, and after all it is from the best horror prodcution company of all time, Lions Gate!!! The movie was somehow involved with Eli Roth, diretor of Hostel and Cabin Fever and did have an Eli Roth-feel to it. This is a must see for any horror fan!",1145145600,6,905,4.355029585798817

The plot is basically the same and other reviewers have already detailed it and while the killings were more gruesome and convincing than before I was curious about where the ghostly Southern belles got their Fredericks of Hollywood bras, bustiers and undies.

2494960,4,B000E5N6A2,"Eli Roth's newly created production company, Raw Nerve, made 2001 Maniacs its first project.  After much difficulty actually getting the film released, whether in theaters or straight to video, it finally hit the shelves of video stores around America at the end of March.  I can definitely see why the film ended up being a direct-to-video feature.  The overall quality of the film definitely leaves much to be desired, but the reason that I enjoyed the movie so much was because of how aware it seems to be of itself.  Throughout the whole film, it maintains a lighthearted tone that makes the film enjoyable to watch.  When a movie is made this cheap, and goes straight to video, odds are, it isn't quality enough to be taken seriously.  That is, at least, the case for almost all horror films that don't get to theaters.  That is what makes 2001 Maniacs different from films such as Death Tunnel.  The movie doesn't care if you just have a good time watching it, in fact, it seems that the filmmakers wanted that rather than actually trying to scare the audience, which is almost impossible when you don't have the budget to do huge special effects or shocking violence.  The violence in the film is interesting enough to make the deaths of each of the innocent travelers enjoyable.  While the gore isn't even close to must stuff that I have seen recently, the film seems to go for style over substance, and not just in the realm of violence, but it seems to be stylistically inclined in every aspect of the movie, and this also makes it a much better film.

Do you really even need to know the plot?  Not really, but I'll give a quick overview anyway.  Eight people set out for Daytona Beach on spring break.  In Georgia, though, the group gets sidetracked by a detour, and ends up being the ""guests of honor"" in the town of Pleasant Valley for their annual ""Guts 'n Glory Jubilee,"" complete with an out-of-this-world barbecue.  Robert Englund is the leader of the town, and, I can't believe I'm saying this, but he churns out an amazing, hilarious performance as the old southern gentleman who also happens to be an insance cannibal.  There are a few classic lines in the film, and that is only because the script is actually really well done.  With the entrance of a black man, chinese woman, and a gay man into the town for the celebration, the viewer is treated to a barrage of socially conscious humor that really makes the movie thoroughly funny.  I don't really know if the filmmakers were trying to say something, but I don't really care, the film is funny, and the actors in the main roles do a great job of emulating this crazy, backwoods southern town full of a bunch of crazy, murderous hillbillies.  If all those reasons weren't enough to rent the film, those of you Eli Roth fans out there will be treated to a special cameo within the first ten minutes of the film.  Let's just say that those of you who are familiar with Cabin Fever will be treated to a nice little reunion with one of the best characters from that movie.

In my recent review of Death Tunnel, I stated that I was basically done watching horror films that went straight to video.  After watching 2001 Maniacs, however, I have decided not to announce a widespread condemnation of all straight-to-video horror films.  I will only watch them, I have decided, if the films, like 2001 Maniacs, maintain a lighthearted tone and just try to entertain the viewer, rather than trying to scare them, which is pretty much impossible for any avid horror fan that would care enough to rent 2001 Maniacs in the first place.  I hope that Raw Nerve gets a chance for real success in Hollywood, because Eli Roth is brilliant, and his mind needs to be the force behind as many future horror films as possible.",1143849600,5,3779,4.580980683506686

And the T&A is all over the place, let's hear it for the ""Kissin' Cousins"".

And not to mention the devouring of the bodies.

The movie is so over the top that it becomes humorous but even Robert Englund can't Freddy up any real terror.  I don't mind gore and guts in a movie, but this one just has a little too much without offering anything new to the cannibal and/or zombie genre.",1143763200,,617,4.339130434782609

This is easily the best role Robert has taken since Freddy, Not to mention the most humerous role. The story I found was very, very entertaining (you can read the plot synopsis up the page a bit). As with all H.G. Lewis films there is high entertainment value and Sullivan stuck to that. The death scenes are so over the top that I can't think of anyone or anything having come close to it in the last decade..or last 20 years for that matter...Don't walk to get 2001 maniacs....RUN!!!!!!!!!!",1143676800,3,754,4.471014492753623

It's awesome to see Robert Englund making a fart joke and then in a bad ass fight scene later on.  This film covers all ends of the spectrum which I feel most other don't.  In most movies, characters have an inner base that you discover as the film goes on...but in Maniacs, every character wears there personality on their sleeve.  There is really nothing to figure out through each character because they're ""SUPPOSED TO BE OVER THE TOP"".  That's the way the original was and I applaud Tim Sullivan and company for sticking to that premise.  I mean the film is supposed to be predictable...it's not supposed to be like a lame ass M. Night Schayamalan film where it revolves around the twist at the end.  This film has ""cult classic"" written all over it.

Lets just say I was extremely surprised. It was one of the best horror/splatter-comedies Ive seen in a while.

The plots basically the same as the first,a few groups of nasty northeners fall upon Pleasant Valleys ghostly celebration,only to fall victim to their gory revenge.

Tim Sullivan ups the ante to the story by mixing in racial,southern and sexual sterotypes and twists them to gruesome and gleeful means.

What he did was bring back to types of films oldschool gorehounds miss...namely lots of gore,t'n'a,and a very un-PC script that thankfully,proves they still make 'em like they used to.

A group of college kids on their way to Spring Break take a detour. They come upon the small southern town of Pleasant Valley. The people of the town and Mayor Buckman(Robert Englund) insist that the kids stay for their annual festival. The kids decide to stay and check it out and that's where the madness begins!

Tim Sullivan did a great job sticking to the story of the original H.G. Lewis classic Two Thousand Maniacs. This is one of the best horror films of the past few years. It has some great gory death scenes too! I would recommend it highly to any horror fan!",1143676800,3,903,4.337278106508876

This is a remake of the godfather of gore Herschell Gordon Lewis' 2000 Maniacs after all, and with that as a blueprint, Sullivan has updated it rather well.

The DVD is wonderful too.  The menus frames the movie mighty fine: it invites you to the theater, to sit in the front row of Sullivan's theatrical gorefest. This is bawdy burlesque revisited, folks, with gorgeous beauties such as Wendy Kremer and Playboy cover gal Christa Campbell getting all skimpy with pretty boys like Dylan Edrington (Shiver)and Jay Gillespie.  With a cast of seasoned pros-you got Robert ""Freddy"" Englund for goodness sake!

2495001,4,B000E5N6A2,"I haven't had so much fun watching a horror film in a long time, I've been waiting patently for years to see ""2001 Maniacs"" I first got wind of it a few years back and after reading the synopsis,  I was very eager to see it. We I did wait a few years and finally I got to see it on DVD this week. It was well worth the wait. In great B-movie fashion ""2001 Maniacs"" delivers.

  The plot is kind of ""Out of this world"" it is completely crazy and wacky. But that's what I loved about it. The film is about a bunch of college kids whom are driving down to Florida for spring break  when they hit a detour in the road, this detour brings them into a small southern town that seems to live back in the times of the Civil War Era. The college students along with African-American tough guy on a motorcycle and his Asian girlfriend wind up in the town where they are considered ""The Guests of Honor"" little do they know that the ""Guests of Honor"" are really dinner for a yearly cannibalistic festival held by the 2001 citizens of  Pleasant Valley.

  You can tell that I was a big fan of this script. The idea  is actually based on Herschell Gordon Lewis's 1964 version titled ""Two-Thousand Maniacs"", which actually has a very similar plot.  I did think that some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, but I overlooked it as the plot itself was very wacky. I found the character development to be pretty decent, although there was a lot of characters to touch on in this film. I think director Tim Sullivan did a great job to give us some information on each and every good and crazy character in this film.

  The acting is pretty good, I was kind of shocked actually because most b-movies that get the direct to video release or get the short theoretical run, usually have acting that is kind of a toss up between just plan bad and alright. With this film I was feeling it with the actors, I think that each and everyone of them wanted to make this film and had a great time doing it. So they worked hard to get the film made right.

  As far as effects go, in this film they were alright, I mean there was a lot of blood and guts to go around. A lot of limbs flying all over the place, people getting cut up, acid poured down their throat and eating though their bodies. A guy get speared in the ass, A bell is dropped on someone's head. So in a nutshell yes there are a lot of effects in this film, some look good and some of them will remind you of the effects in ""Evil Dead"".

  Overall, I think that the world needs some good clean fun horror films like ""2001Maniacs"" It's not a serious horror film in the sense that it will scare the crap out of you. Although being that I'll be heading down south in two days does kind of leave a psychological mark on me. But it's overall a great classic good time horror film.

At first it seemed very promising in the beginning, reminded me of a classic 80s slasher flick, but as soon as they arrive at Pleasant Valley the film falls appart.  The costumes sucked, the atmosphere was bad,  there were no scares, the jokes weren't funny,  the acting was horrible, (except for Robert's, of course.), the death scenes were stupid, and the story was just really bad.  I enjoyed watching the making of than the actual movie, and for some strange reason the shots of the set looked spookier in the making of than in the film itself, go figure.

2495003,1,B000E5N6A2,"I'll say one thing for character actor Robert Englund:  he tries SO hard to make bad movies palatable, but even he couldn't help this misguided mess, a/k/a 2001 Maniacs.  This ""sequel"" to Herschel Gordon Lewis's 2000 Maniacs has the same characters return for another barbeque--cannibal style.

Let's see, the plot goes something like this:  three college morons (they would all qualify for the Charles Darwin Hall of Fame) have just been flunked by their History professor, and he has given them two weeks to come up with a better term paper or they will all be expelled.  Problem is, these poor little fellers already have plans for those two weeks--i.e. it's Spring Break.  So, they set off for Daytona Beach and oodles of fun in the sun.  However, they get lost, wind up at a gas station run by country music star Travis Tritt (cue creepy music) who tells them that it doesn't matter whether or not they wear ""shades"" because they basically don't have a future.  While at this gas station, they meet some other guys and gals and they all set off for their ""Final Destination"".  They take a ""Wrong Turn"" and wind up at ""Camp Cemetery"", a dead little spot in Georgia (a/k/a Pleasant Valley), and then they find out they're actually the guests of honor for a wonderful time-honored celebration.

That's all I'm going to say about the plot.  What ensues afterwards must be a cornucopia for even the most depraved of viewers:  beastiality, sodomy, bad music, bad acting, masturbation, genital chomping, your obligatory lesbian scene, bimbos for days, gratuitous shots of naked breasts, and some not too impressive gore.

The movie was directed by Tim Sullivan.  There's nothing quite like being the supreme ARTEEST; he even gets a writing credit, too--as does Chris Kobin.  But I guess my 90 minutes wasn't totally wasted because I did learn something:  ""the only difference between a frat boy and a gay boy is a 6-pack of beer.""

The people take them in, give them rooms and food, etc. Sounds nice doesn't it? Yeah....except for one thing....the townspeople are raving, lunatic cannibals with a very big appetite.

Easily offended? Don't watch. Not a fan of guts? Don't watch. Hate gratuitous nudity? Skip it. I, however, love all of these things.

2495006,4,B000E5N6A2,"Those already familiar with the original will know what they've gotten themselves into as our main characters follow a bogus Detour sign-just after narrowly avoiding Justin and Professor Mambo, character favorites from CABIN FEVER who are trying to hitch a ride-and arrive in the town of Pleasant Valley, whose residents are hard at work preparing for their weekend ""Guts and Glory Jubilee."" Soon the Confederate knife fodder arrive with Yankee good looks and are declared ""guests of honor"" by the one-eyed Mayor Buckman, played pitch-perfect by everybody's favorite sadist, Robert (Freddy Krueger) Englund. But what else can you expect when there's a population of, you guessed it, 2001...maniacs, that is!

What follows, surprisingly given our times and political climate, is refreshingly vulgar, completely un-PC and, much like the original, an expected excuse for extremely sadistic humor and gore. Where the first film now seems boring and slow, the new version is upbeat and well-paced. Happily and sadly, the first and only fully clothed female victim to get tied up and quartered by horses is the film's only waste of T in a movie overflowing with T&A. Many viewers may be offended by the black humor and straight-up racist jokes that pepper the film's dialogue, but those of you can rest assured that everyone gets their due by the end. It'll be interesting to see how the red states will react to such a searing and scabrous document of the South. Englund seems to imbue Mayor Buckman with a well-judged imitation of President Bush, and even the lives of his two sons in the film appear to closely ape those of the Bush daughters.

Longtime Lewis fans will be ecstatic that much, if not all, of his score from the original has been transferred to the new film by way of musical narrators Johnny Legend and his strumming sidekick Scott Spiegel. Somewhat in the vein of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, these musical country bumpkins pop up from time to time, like Sullivan's version of a Greek Chorus, hinting at the dangers to soon befall our ethnically and morally diverse blue state victims. ""The South will rise again!""

The supporting cast is stocked with many fine new actors and veterans of the genre. Fans will enjoy the cool seething evil of Giuseppe Andrews (Fever's Deputy Winston) as he kills Yankee belles with kindness, and Lin Shaye (fast on her way to becoming a middle-aged scream queen after her role in the haunting DEAD END), who stars as Granny Boone, the murderous matriarch of Pleasant Valley. One day, this fine actress will hopefully be cast in a role that capitalizes on her real-life beauty and sassy charm; in the meantime, she here has a ball pushing the envelope, as when she sucks the red gore off a spear protruding from the gullet of a hapless victim! Newcomer Jay Gillespie evokes a REAL GENIUS or TOP GUN-era Val Kilmer with stern good looks and a thrill for the action around him. The rest of the MANIACS cast seem to be having fun with the bloody lowbrow horror and are in on the joke, all ready to ""take one for the team"" and die in a less-than-flattering manner. As each member is dispatched, you can tell they were having a great time taking it to the next level. This is a movie where ""over the top"" is just scratching the surface. Just ask Peaches, the Southern belle who wears a ""retainer"" that would make the shark in JAWS envious when she ""services"" a good ol' boy! (He doesn't last long.)

By the third reel, characters are walking around town all alone for no good reason, so we know they aren't going to end up much better than their missing brethren. Then Sullivan and crew punch up the action a bit with a scene that doesn't necessarily match the vibe of everything we've seen thus far, but has a maggot-worthy moment that makes up for the switch in tone. If you're looking to get scared, this is not exactly the right film, but if you're familiar with Lewis and his brand of goremongering, you'll squirm, screech and then writhe with laughter. 2001 MANIACS has all the elements of a good time yet still raises a dialogue among viewers that not many have had the balls to address in horror, or filmmaking in general, since the '70s.",1140480000,17,4188,4.732876712328767
2495007,4,B000E5N6A2,"The film starts out like any other , basically a group of friends and fellow peers take a wrong detour and end up in strange southern town,where all the towns people are dressed as if they where stuck in a time-warp of the 1800s. Of course the travelers decide to stay the night with promises a grand celebration to be held shortly after. Sadly the group is unaware that they'll be the main course of the feast. It doesn't take long before members of group are seperated and picked off one at a time by the townies, each reulting in a horrific, gore-tastic death; speaking of which , one of my favorite deaths  probaly have to be one of the first ones involving horses and the tearing of limbs. When the movie isn't focusing on the younglin's getting themselves killed, we're treated to an abundance of boobs and campy humor to keep the pace  going. The original was slow paced and boring at times but that not the case here. When it all comes down to it, Maniacs kept its promise and delivers the goods, which should be enough to please us horror fans. Overall the promise of T&A and loads of gore were delivered. Added with the campy humor,Maniacs ends up as a fun and entertaining no-brainer,gore filled ride that horror fans should not miss. I say check it out!",1140393600,30,1265,4.471861471861472

8106155,5,B000E5N6A2,"I watched this for the first time, the remake of The Godfather Of Gore, Herschell Gordon Lewis classic from the 60s which was directed by Tim Sullivan, written by Sullivan and Chris Kobin. Eli Roth, Scott Spiegel and Boaz Yakin are some of the producers of this film. It stars Horror Legend and my favorite, Mr. Robert Englund, as Mayor Buckman along with Lin Shaye, Jay Gillespie, Marla Malcolm, Giuseppe Andrews, and others. Tim Sullivan, Eli Roth and Scott Spiegel also had roles. I was surprised to see Kane Hodder and Danny Hicks as additional maniacs. Robert Englund is known for Freddy Krueger in the Elm Street franchise and all of the other characters he has played, he truly is a King whether its a small role or a large one. He's the best because of what he brings to the screen. Lin Shaye is incredible and frightening. The rest of the cast did an amazing job too. The special effects are very well done, there were awesome brutal gory deaths. Where there's sex, there's also violence. ""Sex Kills,"" like Mr. Sullivan says. It also has scares, and comedy with great dialogues. It is a hell of a fun good gory ride. I love this movie and I would kill to watch it again.
