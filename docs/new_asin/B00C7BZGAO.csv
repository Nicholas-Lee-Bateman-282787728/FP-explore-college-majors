5693686,5,B00C7BZGAO,an encouraging movie with a powerful message.,1423699200,,45,5.571428571428571
5693687,5,B00C7BZGAO,"I saw this movie in 1975 one Sunday afternoon at the theater on the square where I live. I was 15 the year I officially accepted The Lord Jesus into my life. Even though the conflict with my Father during the 80's is somewhat different than that teenage boy in the movie, ""my Father refused to make the house to where I could sleep."" Everything ended up wrong because of it. At the end of the movie he got back with his Parents. Sometimes I think there is nothing that I want more with my Mother and Father.",1415577600,4,507,4.183673469387755
5693688,5,B00C7BZGAO,been looking for this for a long time,1415577600,3,37,3.75
5693689,5,B00C7BZGAO,Great service and movie.,1410566400,2,24,5.25
5693690,5,B00C7BZGAO,Excellent film. The best of the Billy Graham movies. Great acting and wonderful sermon by Reverand Graham.,1406073600,4,106,5.294117647058823
5693691,3,B00C7BZGAO,"That's what happens when people try to get 'real' (read: wrapped in flavor-of-the-week fashions, slang, and then-popular movie references) with presenting the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ with a target audience of a certain youthful subculture (which is now long gone and embarrassingly dated).  Still, it's no more dated than ""Superfly"" which came out the same year (though that one glorified the Harlem drug culture).

Yes, because of Randy Stonehill and some of the hippie Christians featured in ""Time to Run"" this film is actually an effective time capsule of sorts. Some contemporary Christian parents may (rightly) brace themselves when they see the lead actress walking about in short cut-off jeans and a belly shirt, walking hand in hand with her unsaved boyfriend as she attempts to evangelise him. It culminates in a rally meeting wherein Billy Graham personally presented a powerful Gospel message (free of any ecumenical subtexts---in the film, at least), and the screenplay was written by Dave Hunt (yes, THAT Dave Hunt of ""The Berean Call' fame).",1393632000,3,1063,5.247058823529412
5693692,5,B00C7BZGAO,"This was always my favorite of the movies put out by Billy Graham and his team. A good story set during the days of the Jesus Movement. Lots of good music, especially by a young Randy Stonehill.  Nice to have on DVD, but for those interested, it is also available to stream for free directly from the Billy Graham website (though quality might not be as good).",1393113600,6,360,4.373134328358209
5693693,3,B00C7BZGAO,I watched this movie as a child when it was first released at our church.  I thought now that im older I would enjoy seeing it again and it was pretty much exactly as I remembered it.  I mainly remembered the music from the movie.,1389225600,7,230,4.088888888888889
5693694,5,B00C7BZGAO,The setting is dated but the message never changes. God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.,1369612800,4,105,4.3
8578044,1,B00C7BZGAO,The video played till almost the end and quit!!!! Cant see the ending I want another video to replace it!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Also it was found about a 1/4 mile away at a neighbors house plastered on the barn... they took it to a friends house and the friend called me!!! I want a replacement!!! And it was a used video!!!!,1524528000,,326,4.360655737704918
8578045,5,B00C7BZGAO,I first saw this movie as a young man. I was very touched by it then and enjoyed it very much the second time. It is very real and I feel a huge amount of people run from God as this movie details. Our only hope is found in God. I highly recommend this movie to all people of all ages. I was very surprised to find this movie available to order.,1520726400,,345,3.8055555555555554
8578046,5,B00C7BZGAO,I first seen this movie back in the 1970's and it always held a special place in my heart - I went forward during the alter call when I was 13 years old and that began my journey with Christ. I was so happy to find this movie again after all these years!,1483401600,,254,3.811320754716981
8578047,5,B00C7BZGAO,"I have always loved the soundtrack and finally found the Movie to watch. Not quite what I expected after listening for more than twenty years, but now I atleast understand where the music orrignated from. Excellent movie for all !",1469318400,,230,4.775
8578048,4,B00C7BZGAO,As I remember from over 40 years ago. The message delivered in the Billy Graham production is as necessary now as it was back then. In part through this movie I became a Christian.,1464048000,4,180,4.323529411764706
8578049,3,B00C7BZGAO,pretty good about young man rebelling with father and Christian topics,1448668800,,70,5.454545454545454
8578050,5,B00C7BZGAO,"IT is great!  Excellent message I have watched it a few times and each time i get more out of it

8578051,5,B00C7BZGAO,This is a great wholesome movie! I really like these Billy Graham movies and wish there were a lot more. I think I own all that are out. Great movie to buy for those needing guidance or unsaved.,1440028800,,194,4.131578947368421
8578052,5,B00C7BZGAO,Billy Graham Films are dated but still have a message that is worth listening too.,1435536000,,82,4.533333333333333
