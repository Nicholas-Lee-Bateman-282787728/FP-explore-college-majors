6451544,5,B00KVNCTMI,"This film is a compilation of the first 4 episodes of the CROSSBOW syndicated television series from 1987-89. In this period action series, William Tell is the Swiss legend who saves his son's life in medieval times! Tall actor Will Lyman expertly plays Tell as he continuously battles against grim feudal oppression, as administered by Governor Hermann Gessler (played by Jeremy Clyde) and other ""nobles,"" who exploit and abuse the simple mountain villagers practically as serfs. This disc just wets one's appetite for the entire series which had 72 episodes and featured such guest stars as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Brian Blessed, Honor Blackman, Robert Guillaume, Roger Daltrey, David Warner, Steve Buscemi and many more! I'm giving this release a 5 star review for it being the only disc out there to represent this classic, fun TV show!

 This series also had an incredibly catchy theme song which has never left my mind and sadly, that does not make an appearance on this disc, instead it has been replaced with a synth version of The William Tell Overture (music composed by Gioachino Rossini) which everyone now identifies with the Lone Ranger. Hopefully a complete series set will be released soon and the original theme music will be restored.",1410220800,31,1251,5.038647342995169

6451551,5,B00KVNCTMI,"Can't beat adding this retelling of the classic tale of William Tell to your Medieval movie collection at this price.  I had to chuckle as the movie ended and the credits started rolling to the familiar classical music piece ""The William Tell Overture.  Not a sweeping epic like ""Richard & the Crusaders or ""Knights of the Round Table"" & not filled with graphic war scene's like in ""Brave heart"" or ""Iron Clad"" but for this price definitely worth the watch as it succeeds in entertaining giving you about a hour and a half of good escapist adventure medieval style.",1435881600,,565,4.696969696969697

6451554,1,B00KVNCTMI,"NO English subtitles. Quality was rather poor, the movie dragged, it was ""choppy"", and had a real difficult time holding my interest. Actually, I couldn't even finish watching it. I had been looking forward to watching this - the premise sounded good (William Tell). Apparently this is some sort of compilation of the series William Tell (which I had never even heard of).  I originally wanted to see it because Jeremy Clyde was in it - when the movie started, they also listed Johnny Crawford, Harry Carey Jr., Robert Forster, and Guy Madison, so the cast was good. But overall, I was extremely disappointed. It was only a few dollars (what a waste of money) but I won't be keeping this.",1434672000,2,688,4.68595041322314
