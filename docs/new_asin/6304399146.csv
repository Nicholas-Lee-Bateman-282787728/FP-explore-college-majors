Directed by Ken Russell.

Ursula Brangwen (Jennie Linden) and Gudrun Brangwen (Glenda Jackson) are adult sisters. They think it is time for them to find a man of means. They watch these two men at a wedding. Ursula has her eye on Rupert Birkin (Alan Bates) and Gudrun likes to look at Gerald Crich (Oliver Reed) whom they later watch go skippy-dipping naked in the lake.
  At Hermione Ruddice's estate is a tea party where Ursula and Gudrun are invited and Rupert and Gerald, whom are friends, are also invited. They get to sit and speak with Ursula and Gudrun.  The two men feel it is time to find just one woman...maybe.

Also in the cast: Eleanor Bron, Vladek Sheybel.

Is the first mainstream, modern British film to contain male frontal nudity. Also contains female nudity.

861813,5,6304399146,"Glenda Jackson should have had top billing here since she was the recipient of an Oscar as Best Actress for her brilliant portrayal in this masterpiece.  Entire cast is exceptional, brilliantly photographed.",1410825600,,207,5.46875
861814,5,6304399146,"A year after Hollywood produced BOB AND CAROL AND TED AND ALICE, dealing with two close couples exploring alternate ways of sexual expression as a foursome, the Brits tackled the same subject with startlingly different results.  B & C & T & A, a comedy set in Los Angeles in the latter 1960's, is all teasing and knowing winks.  In this sensationalistic drama, set in the grimy industrial Midlands of England in the 1920's, WOMEN IN LOVE director Ken Russell tackles the subject balls on, no teasing allowed, with graphic sex and nudity.  Whereas B & C & T & A is mostly talk, this movie is all action, and is--literally--deadly serious about its thought-provoking subject.

Based on the ground-breaking novel by D.H. Lawrence (who else?), WOMEN takes the viewer into new cinematic territory.  At the time of its release, it was notorious for showing the prolonged full-frontal nudity of the male stars for the first time in a mainstream film.  The female stars weren't far behind, but there's no distaff equivalent of the famous fire lit nude wrestling match between Alan Bates and Oliver Reed.

The title is perhaps the only teasing thing about the film.  It should properly be called MEN IN LOVE.  Since that might connote a gay porno flick, the title uses the more titillating reference to women.  But the story is propelled by Rupert (Bates, as the stand-in character for Lawrence himself) who searches for a sensual life beyond the merely ordinary man/woman domestic arrangement in this benighted coal country.  He yearns for a deep fusion of mind, body and soul with his best friend Gerald (Reed) in addition to his conventional love affair with the pert school teacher Ursula (Jennie Linden), who regards his searching beyond their relationship with skepticism (""You can't have it because it doesn't exist,"" she scolds him in the final scene of the film).

Emotionally deadened Gerald is distracted with problems of his own, namely his volatile affair with Ursula's man-eating sister Gudrun (Glenda Jackson, in an Oscar-winning performance) and managing the miasma of gloom and defeat that hangs over his wealthy family, owners of the local coal mining company.

The movie is a series of inspired, beautifully filmed, sometimes disjointed, set pieces:  The opening wedding, full of the spontaneous promise of joyous new love, the vibrant outdoor repast featuring Bates' mesmerizing recitation of Lawrence's drippingly sensuous poem, ""Figs,"" the bizarre soiree dance climaxing in hostess Hermione (a truly unhinged Eleanor Bron) bashing Rupert's skull, and Rupert's subsequent nude sensual encounter with nature in the woods.

Gudrun's daring dance before the menacing cattle is spooky.  Her equally daring nighttime venture into the town's flesh markets to appease her lurid fascination nearly results in her rape until Gerald, tarts in tow, rescues her and jauntily invites her to the annual company picnic.  The picnic that follows ends in tragedy, as will Gerald's seduction of Gudrun. (Or is it the other way around?  The excoriating power relations between this couple are ever-changing.)

Then it seems almost as if a new movie begins with a complete change of scene for the last third.  The quartet heads to a ski resort in Switzerland for a frosty vacation that leads to their climactic showdown.  A new major character appears.  The pace becomes more meditative and languid at the same time the emotions turn more stark and brutal, leading to a wrenching finale.

All of these episodes, with their stunning visuals and punchy dialogue (which can often sound like non sequiturs), are sheer movie-watching pleasure, with fine performances from the four principals who each create a very distinct character.  How these four markedly contrasting individuals are going to figure out how to intertwine is a puzzle to contemplate throughout the film.

The final answer is hardly encouraging for Rupert.  Yet he indicates he hasn't given up on the quest for something beyond everyday relations despite Gerald's demise and Ursula's complacency and limited imagination.

But the journey has been exhilarating.  This is one of those movies that jangles your nerves and your presuppositions to make you feel really alive.",1410652800,4,4226,5.156891495601173

861816,5,6304399146,"The excellent direction, brilliant acting and recreation of this period set-piece of ""Women in Love"" by D.H. Lawrence is by far a truly remarkable achievement! I can never forget viewing this outstanding film in 1969 when I was in college and at the time questioning my own personal nature and development as a young man. I was looking for love and trying to understand the roles of the sexes and how love and the nature of commitment is so different between men and women as Lawrence explored in his novel. The film left an indelible mark upon me and I knew that I wanted to add it to my film collection one day. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Director and Best Writing and Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Glenda Jackson won the Academy Award for Best Actress with Alan Bates, Oliver Reed and Jennie Linden all doing their own superb acting in the roles that brought the characters to life. I greatly recommend this British romantic drama film directed by Ken Russell and with the gifted screenwriter Larry Kramer creating the film adaptation from D.H. Lawrence's novel. This DVD is uncut with a number of the scenes that show nudity both male and female left in as they were required to present a truthful adaptation of the novel.",1402012800,5,1272,4.708520179372197

861865,5,6304399146,"My first viewing of WOMEN IN LOVE was at 30, and yes, that may as well have been me at the end, when Rupert insists that males can experience emotional closeness with that one special friend (in the same manner that a husband and wife can).  I didn't seem to take in much else, and many of the scenes left me wondering, ""What was THAT all about??!""

Then I saw the movie again at 50, and had to smile sadly at (what I now believe to be) Rupert's rather naive remark.  And of course, unlike the first viewing, the movie's many themes cut pretty close to the bone.  To me, the most telling moment is when Glenda Jackson's character realizes that Gerald (Oliver Reed) doesn't really love *her* for she or her personality; he merely takes solace in her company during periods of stress or loneliness.

Fitzgerald once said that ""There are no second acts in American lives"", which I have interpreted as referring to just about anybody in the Western World.  Or as I put it, ""No one really ever leaves high school; at 50, they're just as intent on re-living some old convoluted scenario from 8th grade.""",1358899200,3,1097,4.4874371859296485
861866,1,6304399146,"As with ""A Touch of Class"", I couldn't enjoy the undeniable artistic merit of this film because of the lousy technical transfer to DVD. Once again, the DVD box blurb states a 4:3 screen ratio, but what you actually see is a 16:9 image made to fit into the 4:3 frame. In this transfer we see less of the ""black bars"" at the top and bottom of the screen as the 16:9 image has been cropped to fill up more of the 4:3 space. So, while we see an almost full 4:3 picture, in reality we have actually lost peripheral screen detail in the process. Additionally, my copy has an annoying purply-blue vertical line at the leftmost edge of the frame which is most distracting to screen content. For me, this is another great film ruined by those (who should know better?) taking dodgy technical short-cuts!",1357862400,2,794,4.445205479452055
861867,5,6304399146,"I haven't seen this movie in years but was glad to pick up  the DVD when I found it in the store.  A very good buy.  The film is not really restored but the it isn't available anywhere else and the commentaries make the purchase of the DVD a necessity.  The film became famous for Glenda Jackson's performance and the male nude wrestling scene between Alan Bates and Oliver Reed.  The acting and the scene lives up to its name.  In fact I think it would be very difficult to make it today for the movie theatre, but HBO would be game.  The author DH Lawrence was more revered in the 1960s also.  The story surrounds two sisters who form two couples, one that seems on a traditional course of love and marriage, the other toward a course of violence and contempt.  Glenda Jackson plays the sister who feels like an artist but is forced to teach school.  She prefers a more bohemian life and is attracted towards Gerald, played by Oliver Reed, a course wealthy owner of a mine.  Her sister played by Jeannie Linden, is more traditional and falls in love with a landed gentry type man played by Alan Bates.  Alan's character is more interested in philosophy and nature, while Oliver's character is hard and practical.  Alan's ability to love and Oliver's inability to love becomes a central theme.  Glenda is willing to indulge her lover but doesn't feel love for him and acknowledges his inability to admit he doesn't love her.  When she becomes involved with a gay artist on a trip to Switzerland, a tragedy occurs.  The film and book are great but I also appreciated the commentaries on the film.  Larry Kramer was the scriptwriter and producer of the film.  He had not yet ""come out of the closet"" when he made this film and his comments on the film are in-depth and meaningful.  The other commentary is made by the now deceased Ken Russell who acknowledges this film as his greatest.  Since Alan Bates and Oliver Reed are now gone, it is great to know more of them and Glenda Jackson's life is very interesting.",1350172800,2,2013,4.50828729281768

I suppose that warning was there when I purchased it, probably in my enthusiasm overlooking it, but I still felt annoyed that Amazon was supporting an overseas DVD seller as a prime member shipment when their goods obviously play on very few US systems.  It felt devious to me and I am not happy about it.  Buyer beware of the DVD shipments!  Read more carefully than I did!",1349395200,2,576,4.256880733944954

861935,5,6304399146,"Ken Russell did us all a great service by trying to break the conventions of film-making. In this interpretation of love, he juggles the underlying emotions between the two couples with the essential love between the two men. The latter was not a homosexual love but a love of the spirit and the mind. The naked wrestling scene remains a piece of innovation in the cinema. The use of the weapon of jealousy is woven into the fabric of the character perpetrated by Jackson and endured by Reed. The final exchange between Bates and Linden remains for me, the epitome of love.",1285113600,,573,4.627450980392157
861936,5,6304399146,"If there is one British movie made in the sixties that people should see, it's definitely women in love. An adaptation of a great British novel by D H Lawrence, it is a story where two sisters, both with different personalities but with the same desire for love, live their respective relationships with the aristocrat Gerald Crich and Rupert Birkin, his best friend. Shot exactly like his documentaries for the BBC, Ken Russell shows his talent with the use  of symbolism and, like a neo-realistic Italian movie, he manages to represent the life of the British society with an extremely seductive power. And with his excellent actors, who each gave some of the most incredible and passionate performances I ever saw in cinema, it is no wonder that Ken Russell became respected in mainstream cinema during the seventies. For if it hadn't been for this movie, none would have heard of his Music Lovers, of its amazing actors, and seen what is still considered controversial in a mainstream movie, which is full frontal male nudity, during a wrestling scene between Alan Bates and Oliver Reed.

Both a pioneer in the art of moviemaking and for british cinema, it was the beginning of Ken Russell's controversial, but fascinating career. And the first of his excellent adaptations of D H Lawrence's novels.",1278547200,,1303,4.918181818181818
861937,4,6304399146,"The film may set up the women as primal characters but the story dwells more on the complexities of how the men react to love and its demands.  That said, D H Lawrence is still a better (or at least more vivid) guide to women under the influence than many female story-tellers.  And tin this production he does a notable job of presenting variations of both sexes as love first rules, then rues, the day.

Russell became something of a guilty pleasure, a filmmaker who was overtaken (as, say, DePalma?) by his strengths and forget how to moderate his passions.  But in this movie Russell is in top form:  the camera movement alone makes this required viewing for anyone interested in the technical aspects of the art; the acting is top-notch, as are the sets and costumes.  A cornucopia of images lives on after viewing, with my favorite Glenda Jackson facing down the bulls on Oliver Reed's estate.  Soothing the saving beasts, indeed.  A close second is Oliver Reed's snowy suicide, a sacrifice to his crazy mother, weak father, and an inability to meet Jackson's loving demands.  Nothing more can be said about the famous nude wrestling scene - except the obvious point that Hollywood has no actors today brave enough to carry out a similar tryst.

Shifting POVs and the lack of a strong plot eventually enervates the story and the first half is far more memorable than the second.  There's relief when the curtain falls, not real desire to stay with the (remaining) characters any longer.  As the final freeze-frame acknowledges, divisions in what we want from love will always separate us, and not just along gender lines, as most movies would have it.

Still, for the triumvirate of exceptional acting (Bates, Jackson, Reed), the indelible images and camera movement, and the bravado that Russell brought to its screen telling, Women in Love deserves a look.",1271635200,,1864,4.823899371069182
861938,4,6304399146,"The title is revealing but probably misguiding. One woman who is drowning will drown her own husband who is trying to rescue her: possessiveness in death. She took him to paradise. The second wants total submission in the two partners and she castrates her husband of his desire to have a friend, a male friend. The third one wants to absolutely possess her partner but she also wants to be able to flutter around. Her man will end up killing himself in the mountain since he could not get over her the complete possession she had over him. In other words it is a bleak world and even a sad world. There is no hope for love, real love. Love is nothing but a trap in which the human rats we are accept to survive in order to have a social dimension and a domestic comfort we would not have otherwise. With age this film that used to be a cult film when it came out has become a rather trite story. I remember watching it in 1973 or so in Davis, California. It was on campus a film appreciated by women in the name of a certain vision of women's liberation, and by gays for the vision of male friendship between two men. I am quite disappointed today with the feeling I have just watched a piece of ancient anthropological discovery.

861939,5,6304399146,"Very seldom has a movie been such a faithful adaptation from the book it was based on. That is the case of WOMEN IN LOVE,a wonderful and perfect movie with settings, performances, and plot that are worth seeing. As far as its plot is concerned, WOMEN IN LOVE is a philosophical experiment on what love actually is and on the role it plays in human life. Gudrun and Ursula Brangwen,marvelously played by Glenda Jackson and Jeannie Linden,are the two sisters who go by the several phases love can show itself, many of which are awfully pleasant whereas others bring sorrow and uncertainty. They get married to Rupert Birkin and Gerald Crich (Alan Bates and Oliver Reed in outstanding performances as well), who are two close friends who seem to have different conceptions of true love at first, but in the long run they turn out to have different outlooks on the meaning of true love even beteween two men, which brings out in Gerald a feeling of insecurity and a lack of self-acceptance.
What is really challenging about D.H.Lawrence's book WOMEN IN LOVE and Ken Russell's brilliant screen version is the possibility of true love not only between people of opposite sexes but also between people of the same sex.
In Lawrence's bold point of view (mainly for the time he lived in),love is love, regardless of the sex of one's object of love. The closing scene of the movie, a truly faithful adaptation from the book, shows the impact of Rupert Birkin's words both on his wife and possibly on some viewers. However, nobody can deny the beauty both the book and the film provide, and the anthological and symbolical scene of the fight between Rupert and Gerald, which takes place in the chapter of the book named GLADIATORIAL,is far above any possible prejudice that can derive, since it shows nothing but the possibility of love, a feeling whose absolute absence would already have done away with the whole world. A true masterpiece!",1256688000,4,1930,4.781437125748503
861940,5,6304399146,"Ken Russell's film output was intensely controversial in his heyday, some of his work winning wide acclaim and some almost universal scorn and condemnation. ""Women in Love,"" one of his earliest full-length, big-budget features, stands out today as one of his best, an intelligent, good-looking and well-acted adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's sprawling novel about sexual and emotional relationships between men and women, and men and men, in 1920s England, personified by the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula (Glenda Jackson, Jennie Linden), and their respective lovers, Gerald Crich (Oliver Reed)and Rupert Birkin (Alan Bates).

The screenplay by Larry Kramer remains a model of cinematic adaptation, minimizing the long-winded philosophizing into which the author's print characters are won't to fall, though the necessity for condensation means the plot proceeds onscreen in a series of self-contained tableaux rather than a smooth progression. This works because the individual episodes are so memorable, most carrying an emotional immediacy that take the viewer's breath away even today. Chief among these, of course, is the notorious nude fireside wrestling scene between  Bates and Reed, which has lost none of its homoerotic charge. However, other scenes are equally striking: Jackson stampeding a herd of cattle with Isadora Duncan-style dancing; a mischievous nude swim by two young newlyweds that abruptly turns tragic; Reed trudging wearily through the vast expanse of the snowy Alps. Russell's propensity for over-the-top grandiosity is eminently suited to the material here; later it would all too often veer into self-caricature. The actors, including the underrated Jennie Linden, throw themselves with complete identification into their roles, in the process often saving Lawrence from himself. Glenda Jackson's portrayal of the headstrong and relentlessly critical Gudrun is particularly memorable and her Oscar was well-deserved. Bates and Reed are equally good, though the latter is physically quite unlike the character as described by the author. Together they strike enough sparks amid the beautiful cinematography to keep ""Women in Love"" an absorbing film experience after four decades.

The current DVD looks great, with the lush colors of the original well preserved, though the sound quality was uneven in one or two spots on my copy. The extra features are minimal--voice-overs by both Russell and Kramer, an amusingly stuffy contemporary trailer (which limits itself mostly to placards with critical quotes), and a photo gallery. No matter, as the film speaks for itself.",1247616000,4,2600,5.6445012787723785

861979,3,6304399146,"The performances are first rate:  Glenda Jackson certainly deserved her Oscar, Alan Bates is always wonderful and Oliver Reed captures your heart by his very presence.  The story is filled with the personal obsessions that drove Lawrence--finding some sort of truth in physical passion being the most obvious one.  This film adaptation is hardly subtle--driving the same ideas home again and again---starting with the lesson of the parts of the flower in the opening schoolroom scene.  Then there's the famous picnic scene where Alan Bates likens the fig to a woman's sexual part. Then there are all of explicit love scenes, including the nude male wrestling by the firelight scene between Bates and Reed.

I guess all of this was pretty hot stuff when the film was made, but it strikes me as almost silly at this point in time.  Likewise the dialogue, discussing over and over the nature of love stikes me as way overly ponderous. Especially because no one solved any of their problems that way.  I guess that's one of Lawrence's demons--over intellectualizing and then trying to compensate by some sort of physical activity, mainly sex.  I'm sure many others have analyzed Lawrence's psyche endlessly so I won't bother, here, except to mention that the incredibly creepy mother of the Reed character certainly bears attention.

The cinematography is great, the costumes are good, the English countryside and shots in Zermatt are beautiful.  There's a lot of entertainment value in the film if you don't take it too seriously.

861983,5,6304399146,"This intelligent, passionate adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel by British director Russell fuses romantic classicism with frank talk, as the frolicking foursome openly discuss their philosophies of love and desire, friendship and commitment. Reed and then-unknown actress Glenda Jackson are especially compelling as the couple whose marital life is corrupted by her frivolous affair with a bisexual painter in Switzerland. Russell has an eye for the extravagant, like the nude fireside wrestling match between Gerald and Rupert, but such daring, unexpected episodes are part of the film's great appeal.

Ken Russell's adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's novel Women in Love is one of my favorite films. It explores the hearts and minds, personalities, and philosophies of four intelligent and educated young people in the beginning of 20-th century and their romantic relationships (heterosexual and homosexual, friendship, love and desire). They are played by Alan Bates, Oliver Reed, Glenda Jackson, and Jennie Linden.

Glenda Jackson who was relatively unknown at the time won her first Oscar for a magnificent performance in a most difficult role: her Gudrun is not a likable character, she is an self-centered predator, but she is honest and very interesting. I read some comments that she was not beautiful. Well, she may not have been pretty but I believe there is more than prettiness to make a woman loved, and admired otherwise a lot of women in this world would never be able to learn the feeling. Gudrun's intelligence, strong character, and self-confidence make her very attractive and desirable.

The film has many unforgettable scenes with two that stand alone after all these years. First of them is one of the most provocative and delightful sexual scenes ever filmed. It takes place during a picnic. Alan Bates dressed in a light white suite describes to the others how to eat a fig. He carefully holds it, and then pulls it open while he compares the process to a woman and looks teasingly at shy Ursula, Gudrun's sister (Jennie Linden). This little scene is as powerful as a famous wrestling scene, even though everybody who saw the film would recall the wrestling scene as a most memorable in ""Women in Love"".

The wrestling in the nude was Lawrence's (and Russell's ) solution to allow two men to relieve the horror and dreadfulness of the drowning tragedy that occurred shortly before. The scene takes place for long time, 5-10 minutes, with the fire from fireplace highlighting Reed's and Bate's bodies as each struggles against the other. The scene is extremely sensual but whether they engaged in sex or not we don't know...

This is a very special film that has not lost its beauty and appeal now even though it was made over 35 years ago. Extraordinarily striking and highly sensual, it is a must see for anyone truly interested in film.",1176681600,,2297,4.894601542416453

861987,5,6304399146,A wonderful film with a stellar British cast. Leaves you wondering...whatever happened to Glenda Jackson? She was one of the great actresses of the 20th Century as her work here in this film shows.,1172188800,,197,4.823529411764706
861988,5,6304399146,"This is a necessary film to getting a handle on D.H. Lawrence, a writer much more discussed than understood.  Director Russell properly finds his key and turns it relentlessly:  the art deco aesthetic, both formal and almost too self-consciously daring, which prevailed in Europe between World War I and Wold War II. It never took total flight and is easily parodied; it is thought of today mainly as a style of decorating furniture or buildings. It had a short life and was obliterated since the second war; Lawrence was quite up to his neck in it, and its strangeness throws people off who plunge into his works looking for the sexual liberator.  That is all there, all right, but in his time the chick was still largely imprisoned in the egg, so to speak, of late 19th century Victorian aesthetics too.

Simply, it was a transitional period, and can be a little edgy.  Russell is not afraid of it at all and has the guts to drink his Lawrence straight.  So you get marvelous visual emblems wide open to parody or ridicule in lesser hands, stunningly presented:  the dead couple like a bas relief sculpture on the floor of the drained pond; the naked male wrestlers curling into each other in a dark room, their forms outlined by dim light.  Like it or not this was what was beautiful in Lawrence and the film pays it due homage without being subservient; Russell gets in his licks too.  The aesthetic was so self-conscious that it can be delightfully hoisted up the flag-pole for a laugh, too, as in the wicked scene of Hermione and her parlor dancers.

There is no need to summarize the story of the two sets of lovers; just see it.  The major actors have never been better.  They become the complex characters, who while not totally explained are something better: totally present and alive.  They pick up a big slice of the private and public aura of the period in their wake.  Also, the film has the most incredible punch line at the end which Russell just perfectly transmits.",1128643200,17,1984,4.599431818181818
862048,5,6304399146,"There are so many important scenes in this movie:

-->  A disillusioned lover walks off in the snow to commit suicide.  He tosses his gloves aside then just lays down in a snowbank.

-->  Glenda Jackson takes a riotous sleigh ride and brays ""I've never felt more alive in my life!""

-->  The two male characters talk about female sexuality while splitting open ripe figs and sucking out the seeds.

But the prime interest is in the male nude scenes.  The two lead actors wrestling in the raw by the fireside fascinated me from the first time I saw it as a teenager.  And Alan Bates walking nude through the forest, whipping himself with fir branches - eegads!

Thank you, DH Lawrence and scriptwriter Larry Kramer (who later founded ACT UP)!  You showed a curious young man (me!) that the world is larger, more dramatic, more beautiful than I ever imagined.",1128470400,9,857,4.602649006622516

862052,5,6304399146,"Folks seeking light-hearted romance need go elsewhere.

I recommend that you rent the film first. If it strikes a chord, you will want to see it many times, for it is superbly realized on the screen and will teach you something every time you see it. But some may be put off by the highly literate dialog, the general lack of humor, and the frequent use of symbolism--a technique that may be confusing to some, revelatory to others.

That being said, the offers a deep and wide-ranging examination of the manifestation of love as reflected in four characters, the actors for whom give performances of a lifetime.

The overall theme is that love is a compelling business, driven by nature, offering greater rewards for those who risk facing their inner selves, but deadly dangerous.

Ken Russell's realization succeeds in so many areas, one could write a book. One important element reflects Russell's experience as a ballet dancer: the movement of actors and camera have a musical fluidity as seductive as the passions of the characters.

For those who treasure serious filmmaking, this edition, with priceless commentary by director and screenwriter, belongs on the ""10-best"" shelf.",1104537600,9,1183,5.046153846153846

Men are weak, misguided, and ever so vulnerable to a woman's whims. Men's downfall is women.

This film contains much skinny-dipping, interpretive dancing, nude male wrestling, and animal cruelty. The ending was a joke. Two stars for the beautiful scenery and cinematography. The actors did their best with what they had to work with.

While watching this video, I was reminded of a saying by Cher: ""Some women get all excited about nothing - and then marry him.""",1101772800,9,651,5.122641509433962
862054,5,6304399146,"Film versions of novels rarely get everything right but this comes pretty close. I especially like how effective the film is at conveying the importance of the body and physical sensation so vital in Lawrence's writing. I think a film can only attempt to show what the book more specifically says so to the mind the book will always be preferred but with a writer like Lawrence film makes perfect sense. In fact Lawrences flaw is perhaps that he at times uses too many words when an image would suffice. So I love that someone as visually audacious as Ken Russell made this film. I've seen it many times and always love different things about it. Russell is usually equated with excess but here everything exists in just the right amount, nothing is overdone, he finds just the right way to convey literary content without overly revering it and so framing it too neatly.  Russell remains true to the book,and to his credit the way he injects the Lawrentian themes enlivens his characters, make them seem even more vital which is no small accomplishment and so the film never feels ""literary"" even though it is very literary in the best sense.  To Lawrence love and any kind of relationship was always marked with struggle and restlessness because it could never be perfected. He was not interested in the bourgeoisie convention of marriage which domesticated love into something else but in its truest most uncompromised state. So in this film Ken Russell gives us that. Not every detail of the whole story but the essential feeling of love as experienced by four very different temperaments and all four main characters are very different types indeed, and all react differently to passion and interpret its meaning differently also. The most beautiful scenes are the wordless ones when the characters stop analyzing what their lives are about and allow themselves to simply inhabit their own passion and instincts.  I think Russell is very true to Lawrence's concerns, perhaps shares them, but articulates them in his own visual way which really makes this a kind of collaboration with Lawrence as some of the scenes have no precedent in the book. The characters all remain complex and interesting and much remains unresolved because it is unresolvable.  He also did a version of Women in Love's companion novel The Rainbow which is only about half as good.",1010620800,61,2360,4.87780548628429

The film explores all three relationship possibilites (male-female, male-male, and female-female) revealing the true underlying drives of each  sex. The performances of *all* cast in this film are exemplary. Not only do  Bates, Reed, and Jackson turn in unforgettable performances, but other  characters (Jennie Linden as Ursula, Vladek Sheybal, Eleanor Bron, to name  a few) are inspired to excel equally.
Really this is a film which will  haunt and force you to view it many many times. Each time you view it you  will find more depth and more of Lawrence's insight into the life force  behind men and women.

Watching it again nearly 50 years later, well, I realize I am probably in the minority on this because everyone proclaims this film to be a work of genius, but this time I found it to be basically overheated nonsense. None of the characters are likable,  though I will say  that all the actors are first-rate (especially Glenda Jackson).  Much of the symbolism is heavy-handed and some of it is just plain silly.  I found myself longing for it to end.  Later I thought maybe I was being too harsh, since every other review of it I have read praises it to the skies.  So I watched it again, this time with Ken Russel'ls narration.  It didn't help, unfortunately; I still disliked everything about the movie.
