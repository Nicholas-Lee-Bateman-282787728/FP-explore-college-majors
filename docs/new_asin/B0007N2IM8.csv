8172741,3,B0007N2IM8,So I bought this item and it showed up at my house damaged. The CD was scratched and everything. Love this show though.,1389312000,,119,4.217391304347826
8172742,5,B0007N2IM8,"Lucille Ball is still one of the funniest comedians ever.  A classic show that still holds up today.  She really pulls out all the stops when it comes to leveraging her friendships with the many hollywood and music stars of the day in getting them on the show, and her exchanges with Gale Gordon set the standard for sitcoms for years to come.  A classic TV gem that should not be missed.",1326240000,,388,4.361111111111111
8172743,1,B0007N2IM8,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291766400,,615,4.811320754716981
