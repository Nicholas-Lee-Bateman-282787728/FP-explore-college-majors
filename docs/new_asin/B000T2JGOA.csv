Cheers, Patrick",1322438400,,193,4.361111111111111
8207626,4,B000T2JGOA,"Long time fan. Wanted to love this DVD but the sound quality and performance was somewhat off when compared to his previous DVD. Also the pricing was a bit high.

Still a fan, but will most likely grab the other DVD when I want a great show.",1193011200,3,241,4.127659574468085
8207627,5,B000T2JGOA,"Great DVD!  I'm a long time Billy Cobham fan, I've been a fan for over 30 years, this band is just great.  If you are a Billy Cobham fan you will enjoy this DVD!",1188777600,,161,3.7058823529411766
8207628,5,B000T2JGOA,"As far as I am concerned, there are only 3 drummers.  Buddy Rich, Billy Cobham, and all the rest.

This DVD is fun to watch.  Billy, as usual, is in full control.  Grooving, explosive, playing slow, as fast as lightning, applying power as needed, delivering the fast kicks, the sudden stops, and then those nuclear-powered, full-throttle blasts that he's famous for.

Some of his stuff is so fast, complex, and incredible that your finger will be on the rewind button.

He delivers the goods.

I am not thrilled that most of his work is filmed from above.  Otherwise, the photography is pretty good.

This is a great way to experience one of the best drummers in contemporary music.  Too bad there isn't more of his stuff on DVD,",1185667200,4,729,4.625
