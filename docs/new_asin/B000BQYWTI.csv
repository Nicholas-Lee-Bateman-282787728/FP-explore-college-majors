8091193,5,B000BQYWTI,Annie Duke DVD was to the point very informative.,1495065600,,49,4.555555555555555
8091194,5,B000BQYWTI,"This is a great no-nonsense guide for beginners wanting to try their hand in an actual casino. This is why I originally bought this video. Annie Duke is straightforward and packs this video with everything you need to start (except practice, practice, practice...and more practice). What I found most helpful was her discussion of casino etiquette, which will help you not look like a total noob at the tables. She has another guide for everyone (not just women) which I think is this video minus the section about women at the tables. I shouldn't say this, but think men should watch this version, too, just to be aware of common pitfalls when they encounter women at their table. I have gone back to this video several times to refresh myself on betting, etc. It's a good resource.",1383609600,,783,4.7226277372262775
8091195,3,B000BQYWTI,This is a very good video and covers quite a bit of worthwhile information.  The problem is that it seems like all of Annie's videos cover the same information and use the same footage.,1207699200,2,185,4.4411764705882355
