3754483,5,B001PO6BYE,"I saw Terry Fator at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.  I never watched ""America's Got Talent"" so I didn't know who he was.  What a show this was!!  Terry Fator's characters are so funny and they seem so real because they each have a personality of their own, and Terry can really sing.  He can sing anything - Rock, Soul, Country, etc.  I obviously can't keep going to Vegas so I am ordering this DVD so I can view this show in my own living room.  I can't wait to get the DVD so I can see him again.  We absolutely loved him!!!",1249948800,26,526,4.0
3754484,5,B001PO6BYE,"I just saw his Vegas show at the Mirage.  The characters are so realistic.  You believe Terry is conversing with another person.  He is so musically talented in many different genres!  This is a great keepsake if you have seen him live, and for those not able to go to the Mirage, it will be a great substitute.  He is a major entertainer of our day!",1245888000,44,350,4.242424242424242

3754647,4,B001PO6BYE,"Bought on Amazon when it was still  under $10 a few years ago. Now it is $29! A few other characters are missing such as ""Johnny Vegas"" as there are only 71 minutes of his full 90 minute show. According to other reviewers, as good or better than his 2nd DVD? His live Michael Jackson impersonation is a bit uncomfortable, now that the poor man is gone, but it is hilarious.  (Otherwise, it would have been a ""5 Star"" rating.)  A joy to watch and own. Rated PG.for spicy but not really dirty innuendos. Buy either disc and you won't go wrong!",1434153600,,541,4.284313725490196

3754672,4,B001PO6BYE,"I first saw Terry Fator when he auditioned for America's Got Talent and have seen him on other TV shows now and then. I'm a big fan of his. He has a unique talent that I have so far not seen duplicated. I have never seen his Las Vegas act (which is why I bought this DVD), but I did see his show when he performed in my hometown. During that performance he mad it clear that the show we would see would not be his Las Vegas show. Anyhow, I liked his ""road show"" better than I liked his Vegas act as shown on this disc. His road show had a theme winding through it, whereas this version of his Vegas show doesn't. I kind of missed that unifying theme. Nevertheless, he is amazing and I really enjoyed this DVD.",1428969600,,709,4.035460992907802

3754827,5,B001PO6BYE,The rating says all that needs to be said.  We first saw Fator on America's Got Talent where he won the competition.  We have since followed his career and when this CD came out we immediately purchased it.  It did not disappoint.,1389484800,,230,4.428571428571429

3754836,3,B001PO6BYE,"Okay, once you get to the punchlines (in about a half hour), then you're rollin' pretty good.

Let's look at the facts though.........Terry purchases his dummy's/dolls, and has someone else write for him.

Jeff Dunham is still the best.

I'm not saying this is a bad DVD, or that Terry isn't funny, my parents love this guy.  You just have to judge for yourself.  Like I said though, it took quite awhile for the jokes to come, because he spends more time singing (which is very good and shows his talents), but what are we really watching this for?  For comedy?",1384732800,,562,4.514851485148514

I read the sample on my Kindle but it didn't grab me like other books do.  Maybe it is because I had just watched his video and nothing can take the place of that.",1377561600,,286,3.982456140350877

Just a few words of CAUTION: if you are offended by entertainers who grab themselves, one of Terry's impersonations includes this action. Hmmm-Guess who? The rest of that piece was great though! There were also a few offensive words and jokes-but just a few. Overall-this was great entertainment, and I would like to see more of Terry's work.

That only goes so far, you can't just do the same thing several times in a row and expect me to laugh at it. He had a few funny jokes, but most of the act is just singing awkwardly.

An unbelievable talent though.  Not only is he an impersationist (?) but can do it with ventriloquism - which amazes to this day!, and fun comedy, fun skits.  I haven't been to Vegas since I lived in California 25 years ago ... but I hope to visit, and when I do, - this will be one of the acts I book.  Pure fun, and absolutely amazing talent.

3755066,4,B001PO6BYE,"What a unique act! I think that Jeff Dunham is better on the comedy end, but Terry Fator is better on the amazing impersonations.  They are both great.  On America's Got Talent, his acts were more Rated-G, but on this video it's more like Rated-PG, with some sexual innuendo.  It's fine by me, but if you saw him on America's Got Talent, you may have the impression that the DVD is all rated G and suitable for your small children.  It is not, however.  This act was recorded live in Vegas and contains more adult-oriented material (which Terry Fator himself did not write, but had a comedy writer).  I get the feeling that Fator's comedy writer is a little more raunchy than Fator himself.  It's still fairly clean, though, no dirty language.  Just not a kid's gig.

When will these comedy writers learn that you don't have to be raunchy to entertain???? I wish they'd have a little more imagination, and a lot more class.",1285977600,,923,4.545454545454546

3755072,3,B001PO6BYE,"Like the rest of America, I watched Terry Fator and his puppet crew win Season 2 of America's Got Talent, and rooted for our excessively deserving winner to parlay that into a great career.  He's done pretty well for himself.  My recent viewing of this DVD was the first time I'd seen Terry since his AGT win.  He's looking very fit and obviously having a great time as the master of his own theatre show at the Mirage.  Maybe it's just the vibe of Las Vegas rubbing off, but Terry's act has gotten fairly raunchy at the Mirage.  Still mild by Vegas standards, but the innuendos, and the crotch-grabbing that is an integral part of his Michael Jackson impersonation make this set definitely not kid-friendly.  Just a heads up to parents who might feel comfortable screening Jeff Dunham around the house--Terry does strictly adult-oriented puppetry these days.

That said, I was reminded of his dizzingly well-rounded skills.  Terry is a vocal chameleon who can channel any number of well-known singers in the higher vocal range.  That is actually the part of his act I enjoy the most.  He is a proficient ventriloquist, but I find the personality of his puppets lacking in comparison to Jeff Dunham's, and they are much more simply-constructed.  One drawback to Terry's style is that he doesn't have as much back-and-forth interaction with his puppets as Dunham, since he 'sings' full songs rather than having more dialogue.  I would like to see more interaction with them, as he usually is just standing there while they 'sing'.  Also, in what appears to be a huge theatre, the puppets are often featured in extreme close-up.  Off camera, Terry could be moving his mouth and we, the viewing audience wouldn't have a clue.  It must be very challenging for the theatre audience much past the first few rows to see much.  Ventriloquism is better-suited to a more intimate stage.  Since he's got a big space, Terry should create more variety in the types of actions the puppets are doing.

Really, a highlight for me was when Terry stepped out from behind his puppets to sing an early Bee Gees tune as himself.  I'd rather watch Terry sing Roy Orbison than watch the Elvis-impersonating puppet who can't sing Elvis sing Roy Orbison.  A few of the skits went on a little too long for the limits of good taste, including an awkward Michael Jackson number and a flat-out bizarre one where Terry made a huge man from the audience into a life-sized Cher doll.  That verged a little too much in the weird direction for me.

Terry is a fantastic talent.  If he'd tone down some of the humor and make the puppets a bit more active, I could see him with a variety hour on television.  That would really be an ideal outlet for his gifts.",1283472000,3,2724,4.662473794549266
3755073,5,B001PO6BYE,"This Man's talent is tremendous!  He is not only a very good ventriloquist, but also a fantastic impressionist and a great singer!  Put these all together and the show is unbelievably great.

3755081,4,B001PO6BYE,"Terry Fator, winner of America's Got Talent, once performed to paid room of 1.  While the performance was more boring than I thought it would be, the man has serious talent.

To sing well is a talent, to do ventriloquism is talent, to do comedy is talent, to mimic voices is talent... but to do all four at once time is simply amazing.

My only beef is that he keeps bringing out new puppets for every single song that he does.  I think it would be much better if he used a couple puppets for the majority of the show like Jeff Dunham to create almost a persona for those puppets and let us love the puppets almost as if they were real people.

In a few years, he'll simply be one of the best.  Right now he's just great.",1276732800,,721,4.114285714285714

Terry has very much adapted to vegas and the comedy and humor of vegas--and because of that the humor can be very raunchy at times.  I was totally cracking up with it.  And my younger daughter who went to the show didn't understand it so it wasn't a big deal that she saw it.  But it is a show i would recommend viewing first before allowing your children to see.

This man is certainly multi talented and a brilliant performer.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It isn't the entire show that is currently playing in vegas---however, it is most of it.",1273276800,,699,4.528

3755099,3,B001PO6BYE,"I am a fan of Terry Fator since he won the America's Got Talent competition.  I especially like it when Terry said his shows are all family friendly.  Terry is certainly gifted in his craft of Ventriloquism, his singing ability, in addition to his talent of impersonation with wits.  Given the current trend of continual degenerative performing arts by the majority of entertainers, I found Terry Fator a breath of fresh air.

When I finally watched this video ""Terry Fator live from Las Vegas"", I enjoyed it for the most part especially when Terry sang ""Home"" and dedicated it to the US Military personnel who are away from home, among the many creative and humorous puppet characters.  I gave this video 3 out of 5 stars rating because of one specific puppet named ""Cougar"" and the risque jokes from that skit.

I realized Terry is now performing to primarily adult audience and in Las Vegas of all places.  I still believe true comedy and performance arts should bring up the best creativity in us, and not subjugated to common racy humors.

I wish Terry continual success with his career for he certainly has earned it.  It is my hope that he will resist the pressure of the Vegas influence and overcome it with ingenuity and pro-family entertainment which he had already demonstrated.

3755113,5,B001PO6BYE,"I watched Terry Fator on America's Got Talent and told myself that if he didn't win, I would never watch that show again.  He won, and I've watched the show since, but have never seen ANYONE come even close to the talent displayed by Terry Fator.  His characters are fun and his interaction with them believable.  I have seen Terry's show in person in Las Vegas and have also met him. He is an extremely personable man, and very humble, an absolute pleasure to talk to.  Where else can you find such varied talents coupled with genuine down-home humility?  Makes Jeff Dunham look like an arrogant amateur!  Buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed!",1268524800,2,648,4.631578947368421

3755115,4,B001PO6BYE,"I find that the quality of the Blu-Ray not exactly fabulous.

However the content was, Terry is one of his kind being able to make us laugh and go gaga over his singing.  He actually sings better via his puppet than on his own.  The tonal quality seemingly from his puppet is nothing short of impressive, and he has great comedic timing with his dialogue, and the manipulation of his puppet movements.

The extra features on the disc, about his story was really good giving us background to his talent and his ultimate journey to super stardom.

There is one part i did not like though was the Michael Jackson segment, it came off a little disrespectful to the King of Pop, exaggerating effeminate mannerisms that MJ did not exactly put across.  Although Terry's singing impersonation was good.  He should have only imitated his dance moves and his early high speaking voice.

Overall, it is definitely worth the price of the Blu-Ray (a bargain), imagine the what one would have paid to see him live in Vegas !",1268092800,,1010,4.634831460674158
3755116,5,B001PO6BYE,"I was a huge fan of Terry Fator while he was on America's Got Talent. I was pulling for him to win and he did. He seems to be a very humble and nice person. After winning the million dollars and doing a show in Las
Vegas, he was offered a huge multimillion dollar contract at the Mirage with the option to renew. He is still the same person. This DVD shows how good he is at combining singing and ventriloquism. I don't think their is a voice he can't imitate perfectly. He has a cast of about 7 different dummies. He does a wide variety of voices. One of my favorites is his imitation of Roy Orbison. He also does Etta James, Dean Martin, and Louie Armstrong. He also does Garth Brooks but not on this DVD. This is very entertaining. It makes you want to see him in person and if I ever get the chance won't pass that opportunity up.",1268006400,,834,4.122699386503068
3755117,4,B001PO6BYE,"I like Terry Fator. I thought this was great to see his Las Vegas Show!
There are some reviews on here that object to the sexual innuendos. To those folks I say, he's doing Las Vegas, not Sesame Street or prime time TV. So, if you fear you or your guests might be offended by some ""very light"" sexual innuendos , don't watch this Blu Ray Disc.",1267920000,,343,4.134328358208955

I missed seeing Terry Fator on ""America's Got Talent,"" so seeing this Blu-Ray was a fresh all new experience for me.  I was surprised to see a quality performer that can do good impersonations and sing very well with his mouth closed.  It seems like his ventriloquist singing voice is much better that many people's regular singing voice.  I really enjoyed all of Terry's performances, especially the human ventriloquist dummy.  I have recommended this disc to many friends and they have all enjoyed it as much as I have.  A must watch...",1265587200,,645,4.663716814159292

3755148,5,B001PO6BYE,"Terry Fator is definately the best Ventriloquist out there, I'd say as far as talent goes he's better then Jeff Dunham.  Don't get me wrong, Jeff Dunham is so hilarious and a great ventriloquist as well as Terry Fator, In my opinion they're about the same, but With Terry Fator you got the ventriloquism,impressionism, and singing all in one. It's really awesome.",1264550400,,363,4.854838709677419
3755149,5,B001PO6BYE,"I first saw this DVD when I was in Vegas on the bus ride home from the Grand Canyon. I laughed the entire time. Terry Fator is, hands-down, one of THE most talented people I've ever seen! You forget his puppets aren't real people! This DVD is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to laugh. In case you're wondering about language/content, it's pretty clean. Some slightly off-color jokes and ""hell"" and ""jackass"" are the only things that might offend some people. Even if they do offend you, I would have to say, ""Get over it and watch this DVD!"" My favorite part is the Michael Jackson bit. And Vicki. Ya gotta love her!",1264464000,,639,4.47008547008547

He is such an awesome entertainer, and unbelievably talented.
This DVD is the exact line up of the show we saw in Vegas.
This guy is so popular in Vegas, you can't buy tickets when you are there. You have to purchase them way ahead of time.",1264118400,,439,4.057471264367816

Terry is a very classy, gifted gentleman and I hope we can enjoy his skill for many years to come!",1263081600,,408,4.342105263157895
3755165,5,B001PO6BYE,"AGT only scratched the suface of Terry Fator's talent! After viewing the show on DVD it makes one want to go to Vegas to see it live. This is not a typical ventriloquist's routine, Terry also sings solo, and does some audience participation. The humor is more adult humor like one would expect in Las Vegas. Terry's disscussion with his writers re: the evolution of the show is well worth viewing. It provides an understanding of how Terry strives to keep the show at its best by constantly questioning and tweaking the routines within it. It also gives great insight into Terry himself. I look forward to a second DVD of his show.",1262563200,,631,4.592920353982301

And, he has a great singing voice that he doesn't need a dummy to prove.  My 14 year old nephew watched the video over and over.  Amazing talent.",1261785600,,320,4.642857142857143
3755169,4,B001PO6BYE,"Our family first saw Terry Fator on America's Got Talent. We instantly fell in love and were rooting for him from the very beginning. Hit talent to not only do ventriloquism, but also do amazing impersonations, blew us away. When he won AGT, we were thrilled for him and began watching his performances whenever we could on talk shows or You Tube. We have always watched him with our kids as he always presented good, clean family entertainment. We were so excited when he released his DVD. We bought it and sat down to watch it as a family. Within the first few minutes we were disappointed at the amount of adult humor.  We were expecting the same ""good, clean family entertainment"" that he'd provided our family with in all his past performances.  On this DVD, even the puppets that my children loved on You Tube were making inappropriate jokes or using vulgar language.  My husband and I still really enjoy watching him, but we are sadly disappointed that the purchase we made for our family is inappropriate for our children, who love Terry Fator.  We do understand he is a Vegas act and needed to make some changes to be in Vegas in order to sustain his act for an hour for an audience of adults; but were not expecting all the vulgar humor that we saw.  Since I was not prepared at all for the PG-13 humor, I wanted to write a review in hopes that someone else is better prepared for what they would see if they bought it. Make no mistake, we feel that Terry Fator absolutely deserved to win AGT and is one of the most talented entertainers ever!  We love him, but were disappointed at his changes in his act to make it more adult geared and less family entertainment.",1261526400,16,1675,4.457516339869281
3755170,4,B001PO6BYE,My husband and I have seen Terry Fator's show in Vegas twice. I was thrilled when this came out on DVD. Its just like the vegas show! Terry Fator is very entertaining and he does a terrific job. His various characters are great! This is a great DVD for those that cannot go to vegas and see his shoe as its just like the show at the Mirage. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved Terry Fator when he was on America's Got Talent and just any fan in general.,1261180800,,461,4.076923076923077

3755173,5,B001PO6BYE,"Before I went to see him in Vegas, I read his book: Who's The Dummy Now? I would suggest that anyone going to see him live, read the book first. You will appreciate what this man does more than the person next to you who has not read the book. The man is a genius and has a talent that nobody, guaranteed, has in the entire world. After the show, he stays in the lobby and signs an autograph for every last individual who wants one. He signed the largest contract Las Vegas has ever seen: 100 million over ten years. This DVD was made when he first started at the Mirage. He made the DVD so that people unable to get to Vegas, can enjoy what he does. His puppets do impressions of singers from the 50's to present, so today's generation might not know who Roy Orbison is, but Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks, Cher and so many others, are dead on. Most people laugh so hard and so often, they hurt. The DVD contains about half to sixty percent of what the live show contains. I am giving it to all my friends for Christmas this year. They just loved it when I had them over for dinner and a ""show"" to see it. Worth every cent. Simon Cowell was quoted as saying ""Terry Fator is
in the top two of the best entertainers in the world.

I bought his DVD at his store in the Mirage, which by the way the profits from all of his items bought at that store go to the veterans. He is a first class act & a first class guy!!!!

Terry Fator is such a multi-talented performer, he can sing, do comedy and of course bring his puppets to life.  This DVD was shot at his new show room at the Mirage in Las Vegas.  What a wonderful performance it really make you feel that you are there.  The DVD is his live performance, plus it features two new puppets that have joined his Las Vegas act and highlights the adorable Winston the Turtle.

They never go away completely and it is slightly distracting. However, not enough, so as to keep one from enjoying the show!  That is the only reason that I could not give this a five star rating.  The performance itself is certainly Five Star!!!  That being said, except for this obvious manufacturing defect, I thoroughly enjoyed Terry Fator's act and would certainly purchase any new shows that come down the pike.

If the powers that be send me another Blue-ray DVD that is clear of these lines, I would not object!

I watched, Terry Fator during his progression to winning
"" America's got Talent"", and continually voted for him.  Since I am also a long time [over 25 years ] ventriloquist, I can attest to the extraordinary talent he displays in this show!  I have never seen anyone better. You will enjoy his act regardless of that little defect I mentioned.

I look forward to the day he either comes to New York for a show or I am in Las Vegas and will go see his show.

The Blu Ray video expands even more on his tremendous range of talent and that he can easily sustain that through an entire show.

In the semi-final I knew he could carry a one hour Vegas show with this puppets. I was so happy that he won and am now very happy to own the DVD of his Vegas show with te behind-the-scenes story of his career.

Fator is not a flash-in-the-pan who got lucky to win AGT. For years (decades) he has worked very hard to develop his skills and show. AGT was a great platform for him to mature and gain a following on a national scale. I am so happy for his success and hope to see him live at the Mirage on my next visit to Vegas.

The DVD is well crafted and the live performance nicely shot. I specially enjoyed they left in a ""long blooper"" where he made a mistake in a complex dialog and to watch him recover from it. The Vegas show is fun to watch and a great showcase of his talent. Perhaps even more than the show itself, I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes which documented his career to date. Wow!

On first hearing about Terry Fator I thought ""a ventriloquist, how lame is that""  I could not have been more wrong.  His characters sing with the the voices of great American singers from all eras.--he is phenomenal and should do wonders to reestablish this art form.  It is a small investment for such a unique, great talent. Your friends will probably cringe when you tell them you want to show this dvd to them.

I have followed his act from the time he burst on the scene at America's Got Talent with Emma Taylor singing Etta James. I watched him live at Utah State Fair 2007. I liked that it was clean, entertaining and a whole lot of fun.

But when I watched him in Las Vegas he added sexual gags and references to marijuana. His newest puppet Vicky the Cougar was so crass with her sexual inuindos that I skipped it...and when my friend came over I let him know why I was skipping this part. This is not a DVD to watch with children in your family. Terry has compromised what made him famous in order to be popular.",1252886400,16,666,4.277777777777778
3755226,5,B001PO6BYE,"Just caught the show in Las Vegas and it was fantastic! Terry has extreme talent without having to drop the ""f-bomb"" like so many comedians do. He seems to be humbled by the audience appreciation and he returns that by telling the audience to take all the pictures they want & staying until every last person who waits in line, gets an autograph. It was the best money I've spent on a show in a long time & well worth the wait!",1252800000,,427,4.219512195121951
3755227,5,B001PO6BYE,"Terry Fator is one of the most talented and most entertaining acts in Las Vegas.  I saw this show in the Spring and knew I would love it because he won America's Got Talent. I love his humor and his ability to mimic so many of the great vocal talents of all genres.  His characters are slightly naughty, but never cross the boundaries of good taste.  He never uses the ""F"" word, which is the staple of so many comics.  In my opinion, one doesn't have to curse or swear to make an audience laugh. I hope he makes another DVD soon.  I would love to hear Nat King Cole and Natalie again sing ""Unforgettable.""  That was one of my favorites that wasn't in this show.  Buy this DVD.  It is the best investment in entertainment that everyone will enjoy!!!",1252540800,,748,4.292857142857143
3755228,4,B001PO6BYE,"Terry Fator is absolutely amazing to watch. He can sing pretty darn well on his own but when he sings through his puppets the magic really happens. Seriously... the guy has his mouth nearly closed and he can still do impressions better than most normal impressionists! There's only a little adult humor in the DVD so overall it's family friendly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a great show.

As to the DVD itself, I wish they could have kept on one camera view for longer than two seconds. The constant jumping around is more than a little annoying. I am rating the DVD based on the quality of the recording, not on Terry himself!",1252540800,2,661,4.554621848739496

3755230,3,B001PO6BYE,"I rented this video because I was not able to see Fator's live show on my recent trip to Vegas. While I am impressed with his singing ability and thoroughly enjoyed his characters, I felt that the show was somewhat rushed and the individual puppets weren't really given much time to strut their stuff. His vocal abilities in imitation well known singers is amazing. His Aaron Neville was dead on. Yes, the Michael Jackson bit was quite stupid and probably should be pulled from his act, due to the singers death, but that was really the only bit that didn't work. Jeff Dunham does much the same type of act, but he lets his characters develope and get much more of an edge to them. I found Dunham's shows to be much more enjoyable and much funnier than Fator's.",1252454400,7,761,4.482014388489208
3755231,5,B001PO6BYE,"I saw Terry Fator live at Snoqualmie Casino in Washington before he started his show at the Mirage.  I have never been so entertained.  I wanted to send the DVD to someone who missed it on TV, so I bought a couple copies and just watched it.  There are parts of the show that weren't on CMT; plus there are bonus features: one with Terry talking to the writer and director, another with Terry's puppets - both discussing the show as it runs in the background.  Even though I've seen the acts numerous times they continue to bring a smile to my face.  I think the guy who wrote the review that said he recorded it so doesn't need it now will change his mind when he watches it.  I'm planning to buy a dozen more.  It'll make a great stocking stuffer.  It would be great for someone who's sick or sitting through hours of chemo.  I'm going to try it out at an Alzheimers facility tomorrow.  There are a few jokes that might not be suitable for children, though they'd probably just go over their heads, but I think people of all ages will love this DVD.

He's a must see if you are ever in Las Vegas!,1252281600,,364,3.9452054794520546
3755233,5,B001PO6BYE,"Terry Fator is a flat out entertainer of the first order. I just watched the Live from Vegas DVD. I have been anxiously awaiting seeing his ""live full length show""
and it was great to see it in the comfort of my own living room without bemoaning any gambling losses.
The show is fast paced, funny, and chock full of great musical impersonations. All the characters are very enjoyable to watch. I loved the byplay between Walter and Terry's Michael Jackson. It was perfect symetry.  I also really enjoyed the Vicky the Kougar character. I loved when she dissed being carried out by Terry's gorgeous assistant. Maynard didn't seem to mind too much.

I wish Terry looked at the puppets more when he addressed them but maybe there is a reason he does this.

I really enjoyed the commentary by the puppets also. Those characters really come to life and you don't even get to see them. It was like eavesdropping on a bunch of show biz veterans.

I also reviewed Terry's amazing book and knowing all the joys and heartbreak he endured along his journey it makes my heart warm to see his amazing success.
I think Terry needs to branch out even more with his amazing talent.

Some of his characters are a cowboy named Walter T. Airedale, Winston the Impersonating Turtle, Maynard Tompkins is an Elvis impersonator who does not know any Elvis songs, Julius is an African American who sings 'Soul' Vicky the Cougar is a 49-year-old who loves younger men, and finally you have Terry's annoying neighbor named Dougie Scott Walker who loves to party. Terry also does an awesome Michael Jackson spoof, and takes a man from his audience and turns him into a Cher puppet. If you love ventriloquists, singing, and impersonations, I highly recommend TERRY FATOR: LIVE FROM LAS VEGAS!!!",1252108800,,756,5.007936507936508
3755235,5,B001PO6BYE,"We just received and watched this DVD and it is absolutely the best. I have loved Terry and voted weekly for him on America's Got Talent 2 years ago, and he has just gotten better & better. This is worth alot more than what I purchased it for. Best money I ever spent for a DVD.",1252108800,,278,3.982142857142857
3755236,4,B001PO6BYE,"Given, I'm pretty much hells to the no! when it comes to television reality shows. But a buddy said to check out this guy Terry Fator on YouTube, and so I did and was promptly flabbergasted (YouTube also clued me in to Cas Haley, an amazing singer, so maybe I'm missing out on America's Got Talent). Anyway, I knew I was getting this DVD once I heard about it.

For a guy whose main shtick, on the surface, is puppets, Terry Fator keeps you avidly tuned in for 71 minutes worth of show. But that's because there's much more to his act than just puppets. Dude is a capable ventriloquist, an uncanny impersonator, and a damn good singer. Add to that the fact that he doesn't pepper his act with the usual bland crop of puppet jokes. Oh, he does have puppet jokes, but I thought they were quite clever and very funny.

If you've caught his stuff on America's Got Talent, then you'll be familiar with several of his puppets and that these puppets do impersonations of famous singers. Okay, the pre-show gimmick is lame (Terry goes looking all over the Mirage casino for his missing puppets). But then Emma Taylor starts off the actual show with an awesome rendition of Etta James's ""At Last"" (the same song which wowwed the A.G.T. judges in Terry's audition). Winston the Impersonating Turtle, Terry's second favorite puppet, shows up and, of course, it's not a show without Winston singing ""What A Wonderful World"" as Kermit the Frog in a duet with Terry who also doubles as Louis Armstrong. But Terry's favorite puppet is actually that there cowboy dummy Walter T. Airdale. One of the best laughs happens when Terry Fator, gigged out as Michael Jackson, does a duet with the less-than-enthused Walter T. Airdale (who uneasily states: ""Wait, somethin' - somethin' ain't right up here"").

Other puppets are introduced - and Fator lends all of these with their own unique voices - the most outrageous of which is Viccki the Cougar (and I don't mean a cat!). I didn't catch any profanity being dropped in the show, but get yourself ready for some raunchy bits and some serious innuendo. Surprisingly, there's a smattering of shock value injected here and there. That's another thing I liked about Terry Fator's act, that it has bite and also that the jokes just aren't one-offs. There's an internal consistency to the humor, the gags extending naturally from Terry's ability to set up his puppets' characters and backstories. But, yeah, Terry does push the envelope juuust a tad, with the cougar routine and also when he introduces Julius, the exuberant black puppet. The Michael Jackson bit was taped before Michael's death, and so, to reflect this, there's an appeasing ""Please don't hate"" sort of note inserted in the DVD case.

And just to prove that he can actually carry a tune without hiding behind a dummy, he sings a few songs, propless. One of these songs happens to be ""I Started A Joke,"" which I really appreciate because that's one of my favorite Bee Gees songs and Terry is perfectly on point with the voice impersonation.

The DVD to TERRY FATOR: LIVE FROM LAS VEGAS comes with two audio commentaries: one with Terry Fator, writer Rick Kerns, and director Mark Goffman; the other with Terry Fator and his puppet voices. Also included is a mini-book reprinting Chapter 1 of Terry's autobiography WHO'S THE DUMMY NOW?

If you like ventriloquist's puppets mimicking folks like Elvis, Roy Orbison, Aaron Neville, Marvin Gaye, Brooks & Dunn, the Bee Gees, and even Kermit the Frog (and the cougar covers the Pussycat Dolls' ""Don't Cha"")... And if you dig stage assistants who are drop dead smoking hot... If you like being entertained by a remarkable, offbeat, and unique Vegas act (and, sorry, but Jeff Dunham's puppets can't sing or impersonate famous singers)... well, yeah, get your paws on this one. Now I'm off to get Cas Haley's CD.",1252022400,10,3843,4.762762762762763
3755237,5,B001PO6BYE,"Terry Fator is a wonderful ventriloquist.  You'll enjoy this if you like this type of comedy.
Unfortunately, I bought this on pre-order and haven't received it yet (9/2/09); but found that CMT already broadcasted it on their television station.  I was very upset that it had come out on TV before the DVD was even released. That's just not the norm! Was able to tape it on TIVO, so no need for the DVD now.",1251849600,,406,4.4
3755238,5,B001PO6BYE,"This is the perfect thing to own if you are Terry Fator fan and cant make it to Vegas to see the show live. The show was filmed during 2 shows on Febuary 28th to March 1st. Its pretty much the whole show with an amusing opening. It was edited since its two shows and to help cut time in between certain things (costume changes, etc)

Every puppet is on the show.

Winston the Impersonating Turtle: enough said

Julius- he is a singer that can sing with...soul

Emma Taylor- the best friend you can ever have

Vicky- better hide your 21 or younger boyfriends because this Kouger is loose

Lenard Tompkin: The best Elvis impersonator.....that doesnt know any Elvis song

Dougie Scott Walker- Terry's annoying neighbor

Walter T Airdale- The worlds greatest country singer

Halfway through the show there is a mistake but Terry turns into one of the funniest moments ever.

Special features:

Commentary by Terry Fator and the director of the show
Commentary by the puppets themselves
A small book with the first chaper of Fator's autobiography ""Who's the dummy now""

If you get the delux edition it comes with that plus:

The Terry Fator story (a 45 minute documentary) w. optional commentary
A performance he with someone (I forgot but they say on the cover)

Like I said this is perfect if you cant make the Vegas show. Its like you are there you just need a casino and its like you are at the ""Mirage"" casino",1251763200,3,1409,4.584

3755242,5,B001PO6BYE,"Ever wonder what happen to some of those American's Got Talent winners. Bianca Ryan who was the first winner seem to vanish after her first CD.

However when it comes to Terry Fator, you see he has ventriloquism  talent and musical chops to pull off a show worth a million bucks. His ""Wooden"" friends are believeable and enjoyable.

When I got the screener DVD, it did not have the commentary tracks  as the final copy did, it only had the filmed concert. This is-- according to a friend who seen his live show at the Mirage -- his live show. It transfer well to DVD. Better than some of Jeff Dunham's DVDs. The show of puppets and music will keep you laughing and humming along. His range and vocal talent is so verse for entertainment

There is one problem with this show, there is a Micheal Jackson comedy duet with one of the puppets that seems to fall flat due to MJ's death.

One of the highlighs of the show is when Fator makes a male live  audience member into  a Cher puppet (dress and all). Fator does Sonny for a I got you Babe song

This is real family entertainment with an edge for young and old alike. After you see this once , you want to see this again

So Terry, when is the next DVD. I want to see more!
