8580090,1,B00CBVWXBK,"On a dare, a small group of young adults brave the cannibalistic woods outside of Hollywood, going there without any weapons, cellphone or food...but they can bring pot and a camera.

The hand held camera was partially used, for what reason I don't know. This wasn't a found footage film. The writing and acting was downright horrible. Ava Brunini was our token panty clad eye-candy who couldn't deliver a line if her life depended on it. She is the world's worse actress for those who have never seen ""Twilight.""

The cannibal plot was not developed, but read to us instead.

A film worthy of passing up.
