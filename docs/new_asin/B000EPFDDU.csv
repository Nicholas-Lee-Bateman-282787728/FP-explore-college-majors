2526830,5,B000EPFDDU,"I have waited so long for this DVD to finally come out!!!! I was amazed at all the ""MALE"" best ofs and virtually none of the females being recognized as some of the top comics of SNL. This is a genuinely super DVD!! I laughed all the way through - get it - this one's a keeper!!!!!",1152230400,6,281,3.9473684210526314

2526832,5,B000EPFDDU,"I love Cheri Oteri. She is the best thing that SNL had! I am sad that she is not on the show anymore, if you seen the show in the last few years you no what I am talking about. The best years was from when Molly, Will and Cheri Oteri were on the show, I miss those years. If you read this thing Cheri Oteri make more movies or do a TV show. I speak for lots of people! We WANT TO SEE MORE OF YOU! WE LOVE YOU! And there better be a Part 2 DVD. You would need 10 best of DVD's b/c everything this girl has done was just the best. Pick this DVD up! and Cheri Oteri we miss you and love you :*(",1150329600,5,591,3.5891472868217056
2526833,4,B000EPFDDU,"The 4-star rating is no reflection on Ms. Oteri herself, who was always my favorite cast member. She is amazing and can make anything hysterical, in my opinion. And the DVD does have its strong points; namely, the ""lost"" Morning Latte sketch and the audition footage. But why the Barbara Walters/Cheerleaders montages? I would have rather seen ONE entire BW/View sketch rather than 10 seconds of all of them. Surely they could have fit some of these on instead of, maybe, the full length airplane sketch with Chevy Chase, who seems to get more laughs (why?) while being woefully unfunny. The commentary is great - for the most part it's stuff the average SNL fan would want to hear. Cheri comes across as very genuine in person, which I kind of knew already. Naturally funny, talented and intelligent! What more could you ask for?",1150329600,7,830,4.770833333333333
2526834,5,B000EPFDDU,The first person who reviewed this is right- so much more of Cheri Oteri was missing from this DVD but I have waited (impatiently!) for YEARS  for the release of this  DVD so I am just glad to have some best of Cheri Oteri on SNL to watch- over and over.  I hope they do release a part 2 DVD.  Cheri Oteri needs her own show- like Tracey Ullman  where she can  explore her characters and create new ones.  This DVD made me pee in my pants from laughter.,1148601600,7,453,4.022471910112359
2526835,5,B000EPFDDU,"Good stuff for any Cheri Oteri fan.  I personally think that Cheri's talents were very underated and I'm glad they finally released this dvd.  One thing I wish they included in this best of dvd was the ""Robin Bird Show"" where she played a has been porn star with a talk show. It was pretty over the top. Maybe they will release a part II dvd.  There are still so much other matieral that she has done so I don't see why they couldn't!  Highly recommended and you won't be sorry you purchased this dvd.",1148428800,12,501,4.242105263157895

2526837,5,B000EPFDDU,"She is by far the most creative and best of the women who have passed thru SNL.  She is so funny and insightful.  Some of her characters we have all have seen in our communities.  Strong, insightful women who are then a little bit crazy.  Only because they are coping with what comes their way.  The cheerleading skits with Will Ferrell are priceless.

2526857,5,B000EPFDDU,"Ya wonder why Cheri Oteri isn't in any Tina Fey movies or TV shows because she's a lot more talented and funny than Amy Poehler. Cheri's characters aren't creepy like those that made Kristen Wiig famous.

This is an excellent DVD of an excellent comedienne. There should be a Version 2 because there's a lot that's missing and the montage of short clips is a tease.

Cheri is one of the best female cast members EVER of SNL.

Bring on the 2nd DVD!!!",1379289600,3,449,4.385542168674699
2526858,3,B000EPFDDU,"Cheri's fans will love revisiting her big moments: Lavish cheering with Will Ferrell, the prescription lady, some hilarious Barbara Walters (watch how an early dose of Ms. Walters evolves over time), the porch lady, and ""Simma Down"" is a show-stealer with a spirited co-starring by Toby McGuire,  plus much more. The extras feature a commentary by Ms. Oteri, and her audition for SNL. Noteworthy how this audition material largely got eagerly incorporated into the show itself! (Why waste the brilliance?). There's a deleted skit of ""Morning Latte""  with the great Kelsey Grammer. It's dark and uncomfortable enough to applaud the deletion.  The way overboard ""At the Log Cabin"" sexual innuendo-fest with Chris Kattan included as a regular item on this DVD is desperate and in poor enough taste to rate this DVD PG-13 for me. Better still, the skit should have gotten the axe. Luckily this ""Best Of"" DOES include Cheri High Points, outweighing a few potholes.",1376352000,,959,5.095541401273885

2526860,4,B000EPFDDU,I really wanted more of her routines like the drug addicted lady and more cheerleading.

2526865,5,B000EPFDDU,"I am a big SNL fan ESPECIALLY the 80's, but this was a great DVD as I am a big Cheri Oteri fan. The quality of this DVD was in excellent shape, it played well and everything!",1354492800,,174,3.72972972972973

2526867,4,B000EPFDDU,"Cheri Oteri is in a category of her own. That is not an exaggerated statement.

The 4-star rating DOES NOT reflect Cheri, herself, just the actual dvd. This dvd is for fans who want to own some of Cheri's best skits all in one place, but it can serve as some kind of introduction for people who don't know who she is. Most fans know this, but for the people who don't...many of the regular characters she played are her own written creations (Collette Reardon, Nadeen, Rita Del vecchio, Arianna, etc)

The dvd is great at showcasing the variety of personalities that Cheri can play, instead of just focusing ""the regulars"". I'm giving this 4 stars because there could have been a couple of better choice skits put in place of the ""Barbara Walters"" segment, but the dvd is edited quite well! The extras include an Audio Commentary that's worth listening to in its entirety, a scrapped dress rehearsal sketch (with Will Ferrell, ""Morning Latte""), tv appearance, and her SNL audition tape. It's as best a representation of her that you can do in 60 minutes--to say the least.

I'm not going to get too far off subject here or analyze every last skit because that would take away from the magic of it all. However, I will say that Ms. Oteri is one of the most terribly overlooked comediennes out there and it's a shame because she deserves more recognition, especially after all this time.

In all, this dvd is certainly worth owning, even if you simply enjoy good comedy.
For fans who are interested, go to YouTube and type in ""Kevin Pollack Chat Show Cheri"" and you'll find a lengthy ""interview"" she did. You're missing out if you don't watch it.",1306972800,2,1644,4.600682593856655
2526868,5,B000EPFDDU,The price was reasonable and I recieved the product quickly and in good order. I would buy from this seller again.,1297728000,,114,4.476190476190476
2526869,4,B000EPFDDU,"This collection features a nice representation of Cheri Oteri's work on Saturday Night Live (SNL).  It's fair to say, that like many cast members, before joining SNL few had heard of Cheri Oteri.  However once in the national spotlight, the diminutive and energetic comedienne made a strong impression, during her five year run from 1995 to 2000, creating a number of hilarious and memorable characters.  Oteri joined SNL as part of a massive cast overhaul, that also included the addition of Chris Kattan, Colin Quinn, Darrell Hammond, Jim Breuer, and Will Ferrell.

Up first, is probably Oteri's best known character, Arianna who is one half of the Spartan cheerleading team, with her partner Craig, played by Will Ferrell.  The Spartan fever sketches, typically featuring energetic and sexy cheering routines, and ridiculously badly worded cheers, are usually very entertaining and fun.  There are several cheerleader sketches featured, including one at a swim meet, however some of the best with guest stars like Jim Carrey or Paula Abdul, are not included.

Oteri and Ferrell team up again in Morning Latte, a spoof of morning talk shows.  Oteri plays Cass Van Rye, and Ferrell is Tom Wilkins, conducting an interview with Britney Spears.  In the bonus material is an unaired Morning Latte, featuring Kelsey Grammer and Shaquille O'Neal.  Ferrell and Oteri have such great chemistry together, and it seems a shame that they have not worked together since leaving SNL.

The crotchety Rita Delvecchio appears in a sketch with snow piled up high in front of her house, gabbing with zany neighbor Christopher Walken.  Nadeen the red haired ""simmer down now"" lady, appears as an employee in at the Burger Castle, with Tobey Maguire as her manager.  The prescription drug abusing Collette Reardon, makes a visit to her local drug store, to see pharmacist John Goodman for a refill.

Oteri excels at doing impressions, including Barbara Walters, Judge Judy, Jennifer Lopez, Kathie Lee Gifford, and even Ross Perot.  She also does Debbie Reynolds, teaming up with Molly Shannon as dancer Ann Miller, for the boisterous ""Leg Up!"" sketches.  Oteri is wonderfully slutty, working her body to the max in ""Office Flirt"".

""Sparks"" features Oteri and Chris Kattan as the married couple Jim and Laura Zimmerman, whose sexually charged and physically demonstrative exploits, are among the most hilarious and erotic to appear on SNL.  The actors have almost electric energy together, as they bump and grind, and almost drooling over each other, at times pushing the limits of good taste.  A big part of the fun, is the affect that the couple's behavior has on the others in the sketch.  In this case, it is Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Parnell who are shocked and outraged, when Jim leaves Laura hanging up on a wall.  A nice bonus is a commentary track featuring Cheri Oteri and SNL associate producer Lyle Jackson.  Some of the anecdotes are quite amusing, as when Oteri relates how she really wowed the audience when her breasts were exposed, when Chris Kattan hung her up on the wall during a rehearsal.

This collection includes a nice selection of some of Oteri's more well-known characters, and other generally funny bits, that should satisfy most casual fans.  Still, like most of the SNL ""best of"" collections, you always want more, and there are some questions about some of the material selected.  Cheri Oteri is a talented actress, who we will hopefully seen more from in the near future.",1293235200,,3491,5.019097222222222

2526874,5,B000EPFDDU,"As part of the latter wave of SNL girls to come onto the show (and after a particularly disastrous '94-95 season), petite Cheri Oteri managed to breathe new life back into an ailing SNL (alongside Will Ferrell, Molly Shannon, Kris Kattan, Ana Gasteyer, Norm McDonald, Darrell Hammond, Tracy Morgan, etc.). She created wonderfully wacked-out characters (prescription junkie Colette, who looked as if she applied her makeup during an earthquake; relentlessly perky Arianna in the ""Cheerleaders"" sketches; the ""Simma Down Na"" girl) & impersonations (Barbara Walters, Debbie Reynolds) that paralleled (and paid tribute to) the late great Gilda Radner (though lacking Gilda's essential sweetness). And placing her beside the tall Ferrell in the Cheerleaders sketches was pure comic genius, making them the ""Mutt & Jeff"" of SNL.
There's much to like about this collection because Oteri lit up each & every sketch she was in with her unique comedic brilliance. Simply put, Oteri was one of the funniest women ever to grace SNL.",1261094400,,1020,5.302469135802469
