7331754,3,B0119TA7F8,"M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN'S' FILMS ARE CERTAINLY DIFFERENT', October 30, 2015
M..Night Shyamalan' i think it's fair to say you either love or hate his works, me ? I do have all of his films, some on 'DVD' only and some on 'Blu-ray' including 'The Happening'
His work verges on genius that genarally is not fullfiled in reality, there is something about his work that draws you to the films when released, can't put my finger on it.
Weird ? Strange ? Certainly different.
This film in terms of the use of 'media' news alerts does put me in mind of 'Signs' ( i really liked that one by the way ) though the story line is different in as much as it's 'Alien Invasion, in this one, a curious plant driven attack on the minds of humans causing mass suicide in a '24' hour or so interlude in 'The Happening'
I believe his best film remains 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' the most pointless in my view 'The Village'
Did i enjoy this one ? It was sort off okay, there are some grusome scenes and a few points at which you'll probably jump, is it a classic ? 'No' you may want to hire rather than buy if you are yet to see it.",1446163200,2,1114,4.210280373831775

Night, his great films speak louder than his terrible ones, but this is different from The Last Airbender. Do not approach this movie as a serious thriller, watch it with a sense of humor.",1529625600,,290,4.490566037735849

8723916,4,B0119TA7F8,"I rounded up at 4 stars...probably 3 3/8 stars. Maybe its 4 instead of three due to the idiots going with one star. It is not my favorite MNS movie but its absolutely idiotic to say it might be the worst ever. That simply is not helpful to people who haven't watched it and might like it. One thing is for sure, MNS makes movies that are outside the box. Inside that box can be great, some of the best classics can be found there, but his way of presenting a certain point of view is certainly unique and he's very consistent with that approach. Remember Signs, it limited your view to just what was going on with the rev's family....The Village, again that limited point of view....Sixth Sense, the best point of view movie I can think of. The Happening is the same kinda deal....nothing is shown in the movie that the central characters aren't privy to at least by TV or radio or others sharing info from friends over their phones. I expect it now and try to enjoy the limited ride. Its almost like he is writing these stories in the 50s on a limited budget knowing he can't use costly special effects and he can't use multiple sets or locations. Its the opposite of the disaster movies with crazy CGI stuff. This story was certainly worth watching unfold  even if it did seem a bit lesson-like in the end. I wasn't offended...I got over it pretty quickly. But folks, it had to have some kinda explanation.....I suppose.",1505952000,,1422,4.448275862068965
8723917,1,B0119TA7F8,"I have enjoyed several of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, but this isn't one of them.
This movie would be more at home at an Al Gore climate change conference. You know: Man Bad...Nature Good.
The premise of this movie is pure nonsense. Just because some of the flora on our planet have extremely limited and
extremely basic communication with very specific other flora or fauna, does not translate into a World wide coordinated attack on
mankind.
Additionally, the movies premise also incorporates the wind as part of plants life's means to ""get back at mean ole' people"".
The problem here is that wind is NOT part of or directly connected to plants. It is a product of atmospheric pressures.
Also, why didn't the plants view lower forms of animal life as a threat? Beavers, for instance, are tree cutting machines which also
do a lot of damage to wildlife and plant life by damming up waterways. But apparently plant life and the wind are giving anything
less intelligent than humans a pass.
Some of this, if not all of this could be overlooked if the acting was excellent. But it is terrible.
In this movie, Mark Wahlberg has the acting professionalism of an eightieth grader. He's suppose to
a person with above average intelligence (his character that is), but he acts and talks like a ten year old.
Perhaps the plants are sapping the intelligence out of people too.
And why have two children shot in the head with a shotgun. Geez.
Admittedly I did not buy this movie. I watched it on cable.
 So in that regard, I was smarter than anyone on this movie.",1493510400,2,1554,4.630434782608695
