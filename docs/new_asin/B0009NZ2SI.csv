2306373,5,B0009NZ2SI,"This is a wonderful video!  The first part of the story shows how Ginger overcomes her fear of the dark, and the second part of the story shows us how the kids first met Blueberry Muffin.  The video is not scary in any way, but has a great child-like spookiness that young kids will love.  I really love this video and think it is one of the best.",1125360000,7,347,4.073529411764706
2306384,2,B0009NZ2SI,"It was too scary for my little girl.  I would recommend for girls over 6 years only.  Seriously.  We haven't slept thru the night after watching this.  If you choose to get this anyway - my simple recommendation is to watch the entire movie without your child before showing it.  We love all the other strawberry shortcake dvd's... this one just didn't fit the mold of cute, happy, etc, etc that all the other dvd's use.

The dvd introduced many more concepts than I thought it would.  Lots of reasons to be scared.  Especially the dark.  Every kid is different, and it just didn't work for us.  We will never watch this movie again.",1220400000,2,633,4.473684210526316
2306385,3,B0009NZ2SI,"ask yourself as a parent, what do I want from my children in 5-10 years? Do I want a kid who only cares about fashion and superficial friendships? These movies are fun but they are just introductory to fashion savvy and friendships based entirely on those values. The new strawberry shortcake has lost the message the orginal one had. The original was about being a kid, overcoming enemies with kindness, and having diverse friends with many different interests- Having friends with glasses etc. The new ones are all about having friends with cute shoes and pretty bathing suits.",1193356800,4,579,4.918367346938775
2306386,5,B0009NZ2SI,"I think this is one of the better SS DVD's. My now three year old granddaughter received ths last year for her second birthday and it continues to be one of her favorites. There are two different stories. The first is about Ginger Snap overcoming her fear of the dark. The second is about a house that is supposedly inhabited by the ""Blueberry Monster"" that turns out to be Blueberry Muffin and her pet mouse Cheesecake. These are great episodes for the Autumn/Halloween season.",1160784000,7,478,4.7023809523809526
2306387,5,B0009NZ2SI,"The Strawberry Shortcake videos are adorable, age-appropriate, have lots of catchy music, and are just plain sweet!  My 4 year old daughter especially loved this one - the characters are pretty delightful to look at, and there is always a wholesome lesson learned in the end.  I'm glad my daughter enjoys these - I do too because they let kids be kids.",1141516800,4,352,4.661290322580645
2306388,4,B0009NZ2SI,My daughter (just turning 3) is enchanted with this movie because it is just the right amount of scary... enough to intrigue her but not so much that she gets really scared.  She identifies with the characters in that she understands being scared of the dark.  It has helped her overcome some of her fears.  We have watched this over and over and over.,1141084800,5,352,4.46875
2306389,5,B0009NZ2SI,"We have watched several SS videos and this is at the top of the list of favorites.  The music is catchy and sung well, like all SS music.  The story is about being afraid of the dark and how imaginations can make things look scary even though they're not. Ginger Snap in particular has a fear of the dark and doesn't want to go on the campout with the others. She was able to work through her fears and have a good time. They parallel that fear with the fear of making new friends and how you need to be brave because it's worth it to meet someone new.  Of course this theme goes over most preschooler's heads but that is usually what all SS videos emphasize: friendship.

Kids enjoy the campout atmosphere and the spooky things that appear out of the woods.  The images in the show aren't really scary for young kids, just mysterious enough to draw them in.  This is a fun 45 minute movie!",1140912000,10,890,4.267857142857143
2306390,5,B0009NZ2SI,My daughter loves these movies...The songs & characters are really fun to watch.,1140652800,,80,5.230769230769231
2306391,4,B0009NZ2SI,She watched it 4 times in a row.  She couldn't get enough of it.  We collect Strawberry Shortcake dolls and movies so this was a must.  She loves the music in the movie too.  Very good purchase.,1128038400,6,194,4.162162162162162
2306392,4,B0009NZ2SI,"I decided to buy a couple strawberry shortcake movies when my 3 year old daughter received a bunch of Strawberry shortcakes for her birthday.  These are very cute movies! They have a couple of cute songs, fun storylines and great messages.",1127260800,,239,4.829268292682927
2306393,5,B0009NZ2SI,"This gets 5 stars from my 3 year old who loved it.  This was a fun spooky SS movie.  I prefer it to Adventures on Ice Cream Island with the Purple Pie Man villian (though that too is worth owning for us since my daughter loves it also, especially when Honey Pie escapes the bad guy).  Anyway, the spooks in this new movie are fun, and my daughter got many giggles when the gang would discover that the cause of their fears weren't scary at all.  My daughter does get scared easy and doesn't watch many movies, so I admit at one point when the suspense over who lived in the shabby blueberry house was getting to her, I cheated and told her, and she had a big giggle when Blueberry Muffin came out.  The suspense was much like the Beach Party SS movie when there was a dark figure that turned out to be another little girl the gang ended up fast friends with.

The songs were spooky fun, but just to let you know, the montages had lots of ghosts and whatnot flying around, but in fun.  This is a 'what goes bump in the night' cute little movie that little fans of the other Strawberry Shortcake movies will love.",1126224000,13,1111,4.212264150943396

8063953,5,B0009NZ2SI,"My four year old niece first saw one of the episodes on this DVD on Demand in late September. She loved it. The ""No Light Night of Fright"" had two songs in it that just made her get up and dance. So I had to find it on DVD so she could watch all year long, not just around Halloween. I'm so glad I was able to find it for her. The ""Blueberry Beast"" is chock full of music too.",1416614400,,376,3.7125
8063954,4,B0009NZ2SI,I gave the rating that I did because of the smile on my kid's face and the speed in which it took to arrive.  Based on that I would recommend it to others.,1400630400,,155,3.696969696969697

I am willing to shop again.
Amazon is a great place to shop
The dvd works just fine",1397001600,,120,3.8
8063956,5,B0009NZ2SI,"Very cute movie, good story and morals. Nice for kiddos who are afraid of the dark. My 2.75 yr. old loves this era of Strawberry Shortcake, as do I. It is tolerable for the parents to watch, not like some kids movies.",1354060800,,217,4.190476190476191
8063957,5,B0009NZ2SI,"Bought for my 3 year old daughter for christmas.  She hasn't seen it yet although she is a strawberry fan so I know she will love it.  I put it in while she was in bed to check quality and it is just like a new movie.

thank you",1320451200,,228,3.6122448979591835
8063958,4,B0009NZ2SI,"I used to love Strawberry Shortcake as a kid, oh more than two decades ago [yup, she's been around that long!] and when I saw this DVD, I thought of checking it out with my 3.5 year-old daughter. We loved this show - ""Moonlight Mysteries"" deals with two themes, that of overcoming fear [of the dark] and also overcoming prejudice against the unknown and making a new friend.

In ""Ginger Snap's No-Light Night of Fright"", Strawberry Shortcake sends out invitations for a camp-out but Ginger Snap tries to avoid it because she's afraid of the dark. Eventually SS and friends help Ginger overcome her fear. In ""The Blueberry Beast"", SS and friends think there's something weird about a spooky-looking old house when it turns out that it's the home of Blueberry Muffin, a new girl.

Some parents raised concerns that their child/ren were frightened after watching this DVD. Well, I watched it with my 3.5 year-old and she was fine. I guess kids react differently but of course, I would recommend parents watch this with their child if the child is under 5 [and I would recommend it for the 3 and above age group]. As for the learning factor in this DVD - well, it helps children discuss their fears [my own daughter used to be afraid of the dark until recently] and also about not judging things by their appearance. All in all, I'd recommend this as a Halloween viewing treat for the preschool and above age group.",1224806400,2,1411,4.64
