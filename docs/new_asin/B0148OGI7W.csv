7385505,5,B0148OGI7W,"Tap World is a cool documentary about dancers devoted to the art of tap and their efforts to influence their communities by instilling a respect for and appreciation of tap dancing. The film features an assortment of dancers from all over the world, some tapping for personal enjoyment, others trying to make a living at it. Tappers in Taipei, Tokyo, Paris, Australia, India and the United States are shown exhibiting their talents.

Tap dancing has its roots in the 19th century minstrel shows but became a fixture of 20th century vaudeville and movies through the performances of such legendary artists as Bill Bojangles Robinson and the Nicholas Brothers. Fred Astaire performed an elaborate tap production number tribute to Robinson in Swing Time (1936) and Shirley Temple matched Robinson step for step in The Little Colonel (1935). Gene Kelly, Donald OConnor, and Debbie Reynolds did a great tap number in Singin in the Rain (1952) and some fancy tapping footwork was featured in the Academy Award-winning Best Picture, The Artist (2011). Dancers Gregory Hines and Savion Glover breathed new life into the art form and made tap appealing to an entire new generation at the turn of the century.

For Tap World, tap dancers of all ages were encouraged to share their individual journey to be considered for inclusion. More than 115 submissions were received from more than a dozen countries. The most compelling were chosen and woven into the film alongside some of the masters of tap. Some of the performers include a New Jersey man who has kept dancing even after losing a leg to bone cancer; a Brazilian tap dancer who mentors underprivileged kids; a young man who escaped his crime-ridden neighborhood and financed his college education by dancing for handouts aboard New York City subways; and a Pennsylvania woman whos dedicated herself to teaching adult tap dancers.

There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD release.",1446336000,5,1945,5.052959501557632

8730042,3,B0148OGI7W,"A lot of racial discussion, so not as kid friendly as it could be. I understand that there are racial elements to the history of tap but it was slightly belabored and diminished the otherwise lovely documentary.",1522195200,,211,4.72972972972973

8730045,5,B0148OGI7W,"A documentary trip around the world, and see great tappers from around the world. Really suprising in many ways. True poignancy is some of the stories, particularly minorities in New York, who can afford little, but still manage to find time to dance. Tap is a universal language and this proves it. I would have liked to see a routine,where this is mostly improvised, but it is still a great trip, and for once a film that moves by almost too quickly.",1457049600,,452,4.524390243902439
