8486445,4,B005TMXY6Q,"...there was this black & white thriller from 1961 about a doctor on the run who is innocent. Just like Dr. Kimble.
This is a rather unknown little film, but a real gem. A movie that I enjoy watching again almost every year.
I'm happy that it's finally available on DVD. My old German copy recorded from TV in the 90's was losing it's quality rapidly.
Hopefully there will be more unknown old movies like this released on DVD in the future.",1395705600,,440,4.378048780487805
