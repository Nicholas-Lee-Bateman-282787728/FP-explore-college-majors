8749723,5,B01B9RO6U2,"Following similar videos on Mahler's 3rd and 2nd symphonies, this new Jason Starr opus explores the musical, philosophical, biographical, spiritual, and literary aspects of Mahler's masterpiece. The commentators present concise insights with musical excerpts, dramatized scenes and exquisite photography. The audio is in both stereo and 5.1. There are English, French, and German subtitles for the sung and written texts, but not of the entire dialogue. The seven supplemental extras add even more insights using the same methods as the feature film. Audio and visual production values are of the highest order. Thank you Jason Starr for your wonderful work! This exegesis complements the Leonard Bernstein commentary DVD that came out in the 2005 Mahler box set on DGG.",1459555200,4,770,5.4789915966386555
8749724,5,B01B9RO6U2,"Of all of Jason Starrs wonderful documentaries on the life and music of Gustav Mahler, this one is the most inspired and beautiful. I had the wonderful opportunity of attending the films premiere at the 2015 Mahlerfest in Boulder Colorado. After the final fade to black there was a pensive and emotional pause followed by a rousing and well-deserved standing ovation for Mr. Starr from every patron in attendance. It was a memory that I will never forget and I look forward to reliving it with this high definition release.

The film cleverly interweaves live action scenes representing Eastern Oriental habits, on-location scenes with points of interest from Mahlers life, and commentary from the leading Mahler scholars of our day. Of course, the entire production is masterfully edited together with the backdrop of Mahlers immortal score of Das Lied von der Erde. The art direction, cinematography, and sound engineering are nothing short of breathtaking; combined with the viewers love of the music the experience is none other than wonderful and enriching.

It is also worth to mention that the music used in this film is from an excellent performance from the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande conducted by Neeme J&auml;rvi with soloists none other than Thomas Hampson (who is also a principal commentator in the film) and Paul Groves. I believe the Blu-ray special edition comes with the HD recording of the performance also directed by Mr. Jason Starr.

In summary, one could argue that of all of Mahlers works there was none more personal than Das Lied von der Erde. If it were possible to match such a beautiful and personal musical expression with that of film I attest Mr. Jason Starr has done it with Everywhere and Forever: Mahlers Song of the Earth. I highly recommend it - a must-have for any music lover, film lover, and Mahlerian alike.
