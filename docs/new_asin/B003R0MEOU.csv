Mainly because Urkle didn't show up until mid though the 1st season (he showed up the most starting on disc 3). Then season 2 was released about a year and 8 months later. I really started loving it from start to finish with season 2. It has been 8 months since the release of season 2. Warner, please don't give up on this one. Start feeling the Urkle circle again and come on out with the 3rd season. We are counting on you!",1350950400,6,518,4.138613861386139

4172481,1,B003R0MEOU,"Family Matters is my all-time favorite show, and this is the 3rd season of the show that I have on the DVD set. I also have the first two seasons, and the seasons from 4-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is the very last season, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or watch the 9th season of Family Matters. Seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch anyway. Other than that, this 3rd season of Family Matters is a good season to watch with good episodes, and with good memories of the Winslow family. And I do like Jaleel White as the main character of the whole show playing (Steve Urkel), which was a character that was played by him throughout all the nine seasons of the show, including this 3rd season.

One of my favorite episodes from this 3rd season is ""Making The Team"", an episode where Steve Urkel plays on the basketball team and wins, and Laura wants to be a cheerleader and ends up becoming one at the game.

It's also noticeable that this show Family Matters came out with seven Christmas episodes, and the 2nd season has the first Christmas episode. But this 3rd season of Family Matters did not come out with a Christmas episode, and neither did the first season. And I like to see the Christmas episodes, because they bring back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas on the show. The 2nd season and the seasons from 4-9 of Family Matters came out with Christmas episodes all together, and the 4th season has the 2nd Christmas episode. And again I do Iike the Christmas episodes of Family Matters, but the Christmas episode from the 9th season is what I would do without watching. Because like I said, I don't like the 9th season, and I wouldn't buy or watch it for a simple reason. And it's really not a big deal if there's no Christmas episode from this 3rd season, because this 3rd season of Family Matters is still a good season to watch with good episodes.

Again let me just say that all the regular episodes from this 3rd eseason of Family Matters also brings back good memories of the Winslow family, and with Jaleel White playing (Steve Urkel). The 2nd season was when Jaleel White became one of the main characters. And in this 3rd season and in the seasons from 4-9 of Family Matters, he continues to be funny and famous playing (Steve Urkel), so this is a good show with him that he's even best known for. And not only do I like Jaleel White on the show, but I also like all the other main characters. This show Family Matters is also one of the best shows I've ever seen, and I would watch it over again to enjoy with good memories, but only from seasons 1-8, including this 3rd season. It's even a show that puts me in a happy zone buy watching and enjoying it, and it's a show that I would never want to forget.

Another one of my favorite episodes from this 3rd season is ""Love and Kisses"", an episode where Laura meets singer Johnny Gill inside her house and where Johnny Gill sings to her, by Steve Urkel getting Laura to meet him, and an episode where Carl and Harriette goes on their 2nd honeymoon vacation and they stay in a room with three walls during a snowy weather. And I do like the scene from that episode with Johnny Gill singing inside the Winslow house with Steve and Laura, but my favorite scene from that episode is the one where Carl and Harriette are on their 2nd honeymoon vacation. And as a married couple on the show, I find Reginald Veljohnson as (Carl) and Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) really enjoyed their 2nd honeymoon vacation together, even though it was in a snowy weather with snowflakes falling outside by the room. That episode from this 3rd season sure does bring back good memories, and it's an episode I would never want to forget.",1490572800,,3825,4.405940594059406

I couldn't wait for 8:00pm to hit, This show was the first of several family oriented programs that would come on from 8:00pm-10:00pm.  I have purchased the first 4 seasons because I wanted to share this with my two children. They also have fallen in love with The Winslow Family. I wish television was more like this. I also purchased this series because I want my children to have something good and clean to enjoy. Each episode has a positive message and I really like that.

4172790,5,B003R0MEOU,"I belong to a generation who because of when we grew up got to watch Family Matters when it originally aired on ABCs TGIF lineup (later CBS) and in syndication on TBS among other networks. To me, Family Matters will always harken back to a time when my biggest responsibility was being a kid. Part of me wonders how I can possibly be objective under such a strong nostalgic pull but here it goes

Season Three I think began a move away from the Winslow family and focus more on Urkels antics. In this season, its a lot more subtle (the jet pack episode, or the Urkelbot episodes) and certainly not as unbelievable as the transformation chamber or teleportation device of later years of the show. That being said, I think its still a good season from the family centric standpoint. Of course, your mileage may vary. Maybe you enjoy the goofier story lines of the later years.

The comedy of Family Matters and the family dynamic feels much more realistic than most of the shows that air today. I could watch this all day and indeed I flittered away several days rolling through the episodes on these three discs.",1458604800,,1111,4.55

4173148,5,B003R0MEOU,Funniest show from the 90's. I absolutely love this show. I am sooooooo excited that they are releasing these on dvd. The first two seasons are a bit slow but from seasons 3 and on the show really takes off and gets even more hilarious as the kids grow up. Please hurry and release the entire season of the this show.

4173150,4,B003R0MEOU,"I recently bought Season 3 of ""Family Matters"" and the show is one of my childhood favorites so having it means a lot to me. But I've got a bone to pick with Warner Home Video over the technical aspects of this release. for example the first two seasons of the show that were released on DVD contained English stereo surround sound audio (2.0). But for whatever reason, that is not the case for Season 3. Season 3 is in Mono Dolby Digital sound. The sound is coming through one channel: the center speaker. The sound quality is terrible. It might be ok if someone is listening through tv speakers, but if they can give their releases of The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men Widescreen transfers and 5.1 soundtracks, then they can at least give FM a stinkin 2.0 track and SOME special features. Season 4 is due out in February. I want it but Warner Bros had better get it together for that release.",1385769600,,903,4.349112426035503

Since she is 8, this wasn't a huge deal, but I a more careful packaging system would be better practice. She liked the gift and I assume it was as advertised.",1523318400,,268,4.0754716981132075

8402817,5,B003R0MEOU,"I ordered this DVD for my children.  They are 8 and 9 years old.  They loved watching the Winslow family and of course, their neighbor, Steve.  Both kids had lots of laughs and learned some good family values from these episodes.  As a parent, I enjoyed watching it with them and the characters brought back many childhood memories. I specifically purchased this because it knew the content would be appropriate for my children.  Many shows for kids these days are full of violence or adult humor and I am not interested in that for my family.  These episodes were just right......age- appropriate, funny and educational.  We would watch it again!",1519257600,,647,4.827272727272727

8402822,5,B003R0MEOU,"If  there  is  any  show  I  love  then  this  is  the  one.
Urkel  sleepwalks  into  Harriet  &  Carl's  room  &  hits  Carl  over  the  head  with  a  newspaper.  &  after  Urkel  undergoes  hypnosis  they  learn  Urkel  has  had  his  feelings  hurt.
He's  got  a  pet  beetle  in  one  episode,  A  robot  who  settles  for  Laura.
The  season  offers  a  lot  as  far  as  laughing  &  great  humor  goes.
Steve  Urkel  never  disappoints.
Steve  &  Carl  have  their  arguments  &  that's  the  funny  part,  Steve  tries  to  be  better  then  Carl,  Carl  tries  to  be  better  then  Steve.  &  is  a  never  ending  thing  between  them.
But  Steve  never  gives  up  when  he  wants  to  impress  or  send  an  important  message  of  his  own.
That's  what  makes  the  show  so  great.",1505174400,,798,4.207692307692308
