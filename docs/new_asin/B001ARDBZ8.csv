8279161,3,B001ARDBZ8,"With the logistical headaches of ""Das Rheingold"" behind him, Harry Kupfer can concentrate on *Personnenregie* in an opera that's about intimate relationships, ""Ride of the Valkyries"" or no (and the Ride is pretty grisly). Kupfer I (Teldec) enjoyed strong chemistry among its principals and Kupfer II doesn't quite meet that standard. One particularly strange conceit: During the ""Todesverkundigung"" scene, Brnnhilde covers Siegmund's face and hair in white goop. A death mask? I guess so. Another change from Kupfer I comes when Wotan sings ""Das Ende! Das Ende!"" and the World Ash splinters. The incorporation of the natural world is an improvement from Kupfer I, but not enough to swing one's preference on that alone.

Looking for all the world like Ringo Starr, Falk Struckmann finds the ""Walkre"" Wotan a far more taxing proposition than the ""Rheingold"" one and struggles mightily with it. He's also developed the bad habit of pushing tone out through his nose. Morris (Levine/DG), Terfel (Levine/DG II), Albert Dohmen (Thielemann/Opus Arte) and even Tomlinson (Kupfer I/Teldec) are all several furlongs ahead. By the same token, Lioba Braun's tonally sclerotic Fricka isn't a patch on Stephanie Blythe (DG II), Linda Finnie (Kupfer I), Christa Ludwig (DG I) or Mihoko Fujimura (Thielemann). Richard Berkeley-Steele brings a dark dramatic tenor to the proceedings, along with an intriguingly dignified stage deportment, although a slow beat in sustained tones hints at why his international career was so brief.

Linda Watson's Sieglinde is all to the good, although she will be still more aptly cast as Thielemann's Brnnhilde. In this role, Jessye Norman (DG I) is hard to surpass for sumptuous tone and eloquent phrasing, while Eva-Maria Westbroek (DG II and the Simon Rattle ""Walkre"") demonstrates at every opportunity why she is today's Sieglinde of choice. Watson's stage spouse, Eric Halfvarson, is the most brutish on DVD, although a lack of cultivation doesn't extend to his singing, thankfully. As for the title part, Deborah Polaski is easily preferable to Hildegard Behrens (DG I) or Deborah Voigt (DG II), with a Crespin-like shimmer in her tone and meticulous attention to the text. True, her upper register blanches and she must feint at the Cs in the Battlecry. No one surpasses Dame Anne Evans (Kupfer I), who manages to sing a lyrically oriented Brnnhilde without slighting any of the dramatic necessities of the part.

If Bertrand de Billy's ""Rheingold"" was workmanlike, his ""Walkre"" doesn't even rise to that level. He seems to take each page as it comes, creating a constant feeling of discontinuity. Kupfer I (w. Evans, Secunde, Finnie; Elming, Tomlinson, Hoelle/Barenboim, cond.) remains the top choice although, for a representational ""Walkre,"" the Thielemann-led Tankerd Dorst production on Opus Arte is indispensable, not least for John Botha's Siegmund, the best on DVD by a considerable margin. Unfortunately, it's a one-off. A complete cycle from Thielemann would be welcome, as he is the finest Wagnerian on the podium today.",1491609600,,3057,5.31198347107438
8279162,5,B001ARDBZ8,"Other performances are musically superior to this...but there is a subtlety here that, for this observer, is mind bending:  Fricka's phoney Ram canes....Wotan revealing himself in Act III as the World Ash Tree....one is not at the opera...one is with one's primordial tribe working out a cosmic mystery.

The singers are fine...the orchestra is fine...but there is a ""finess"" transcendent in this production that the seasoned Wagnerian should not miss.

Lest these remarks come off as coldly intellectual, I needed three Bounties to get through Act III...got the boo hoo's early on and still may have to reach for another.",1286841600,4,622,5.2
