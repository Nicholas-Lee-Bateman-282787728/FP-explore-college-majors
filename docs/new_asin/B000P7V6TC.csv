8189873,1,B000P7V6TC,Why is a 3-hour DVD $900?,1474156800,,25,3.3333333333333335
8189874,5,B000P7V6TC,"In college back in 1991, I picked the name Rockefeller out of a hat and because I picked their name I had to do my book report in my US History class on them.  I went to the library and found every book I could on them.  Starting with Collier & Horowitz's An American Dynasty to Peter Johnson's Rockefeller Century &  Conscious (two different books), THEN finding the books on Nelson THE IMPERIAL ROCKEFELLER & I NEVER WANTED TO BE VICE PRESIDENT OF ANYTHING; then the quintessential book DAVID: REPORT ON A ROCKEFELLER...written in 1971 where the author said ""for David Rockefeller, the presidency of the United States would be a demotion"" (LOL); I considered myself a Rockefeller historian!  LOL  What an amazing family, controversial of course, you don't become the most powerful, richest family in this country and not have some controversy.  I like how they peeled back the layers of each generation.  Seeing David (at the time 85) and Laurance (at the time 90) speak was interesting.  I just wish they would do one like this on William's side of the family.  But overall a great documentary.",1434499200,,1097,4.761904761904762
8189875,4,B000P7V6TC,"Well told and intelligent, the saga of the Rockefeller family is one of
the great American stories. There was a lot of detail in this thorough
documentary I had never known before. I was never bored despite the two
parts running three and a half hours.

That said, it was somewhat lacking in emotion, as, apparently the
Rockefellers were themselves at times. Unlike the story of the Kennedys
or FDR, or others that American Experience have covered, it felt like a
great history lesson, but not a powerful film.

That almost certainly is a comment on the subjects, not the
film-making, and I'm glad they didn't try to force this cold, distant
and strange bunch into artificially likability.",1384300800,,689,4.830508474576271
8189876,5,B000P7V6TC,"I like everything about this video documentary. I knew nothing about the Rockefellers before, and now I feel I know all about their story. I don't understand why people have given it such poor reviews, and don't really care, I found it very interesting and informative. I have this 1-disc video from the library right now. Part-1 is 1:23:35, and Part-2 is 1:49:10. So total length is 3:12:45, or 193 minutes, which is 17 min less than indicated in the listing.",1372291200,,460,4.691358024691358
8189877,2,B000P7V6TC,"The program is annoying in a number of ways. First it is quite superficial. It never goes into any detail re how the fortune was built up. Rockefeller just suddenly owns a big refinery and is on the way to riches. You never learn how he managed to assemble the money for his first refinery. Then it has a parade of pointless commentators. Why do PBS productions always need a parade of people making one or two minute comments all the time. They are simply identified as ""historians"". Affiliated where? What justifies calling them that? Do they just appear and say ""I am an historian and want to be hired to make comments""? Most of the comments don't add anything to the story and some of them obviously dramatize what little they have to say to shine in their two minutes of glory. The background sounds are excessive. The content is so thin that everything the DVD says could be said in half the time. Another PBS failure of a production.",1360713600,2,940,4.502923976608187
8189878,5,B000P7V6TC,"Bought the DVD after visiting the Rockefeller estate in Westchester County, NY.
Wanted to know more about the family.  The DVD gave a good in depth understanding with the good and the bad about the Rockefellers from the parents of John D. to now.
Learned a lot.",1309737600,,261,4.553191489361702
8189879,3,B000P7V6TC,"""The Rockefellers""  is well researched documentary of a family with power going beyond money alone.  It is over three hours long, and could have been done in less than two hours to get the main points and still hold interest.  Overall it shows the shady beginnings and the family's ultimate mission of public service.",1289779200,2,317,4.833333333333333
8189880,1,B000P7V6TC,"""The Rockefellers"" It's a lousy product. I could not watch it without interruptions. The worst thing is the background music. Most of the time it is very loud. Moreover, the choice of music does not match to its contents at all.

It makes me DIZZY time to time; sometimes it makes me feel I'm going crazy. And this is not the only one. There are some other PBS DVDs with too loud background music.

The contents? It's OK. Four stars.

But, still....

How could anybody watch a DVD when it discomforts you so much? This product deserves ony one star, overall.",1242864000,2,558,4.4950495049504955
8189881,5,B000P7V6TC,"As someone who is a lover of biographies, especially political biographies, I was thrilled the first time that PBS ran this series on the Rockefellers.  I only knew bits and pieces about the family from articles that I read.  But, watching the miniseries really sparked my fascination.  To see how the family evolved from the patriarch, old ""devil"" Bill Rockefeller, into the philanthropic dynasty that we know was a particularly interesting journey.  I would encourage everyone to buy this series because it combines all the elements of a good story: love, sex, angst, losses and victories.  You won't be disappointed.",1202860800,4,619,5.15
8189882,3,B000P7V6TC,"This series is lllllloooonnnngggg!!!  Still, I enjoyed it.  I wonder about how the rich get rich and stay rich.  This work illustrates that via one family.  Some may feel that the Rockefellers are yesteryear's news, but the topics presented here are very similar to what Bill Gates is facing.  This work moves from monopolies to philanthropy to politics.  What stood out to me is how ever Rockefeller generation did something differently once the parents died and couldn't chastise them.  I think many young people may relate to wanting to free themselves from older authorities.

The first rich Rockefeller lost all his hair.  They had an interviewee with no eyebrows.  I wonder if they purposely chose her because she was missing hair that most people still possess.  One interviewee had really bad teeth that any dentist could have fixed.  One Rockefeller descendant interviewed had a Band-Aid on his head.  I think that points to his humanity that he was willing to be filmed bandaged when he could have requested an interview after the cut on his head healed.

Several Rockefellers, of various ages and genders, gave interviews for this work.  They must have approved of the documentary if they willingly participated.  Though the work speaks of condemnation of the Rockefellers by the public, they also just reported the facts.  Perhaps the neutrality of the work persuaded the family to get involved in it.

I was going to title my review ""For those whom much is given"" and then one Rockefeller actually spoke that line himself.  Perhaps it's a given that the mega-rich have responsibilities in addition to their numerous advantages.",1182211200,7,1640,5.029739776951673
