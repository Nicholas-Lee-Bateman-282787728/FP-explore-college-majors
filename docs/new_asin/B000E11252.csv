8103674,5,B000E11252,"This biblical love story that broke all of the laws that were to have been enforced by their king, became a passionate tragedy turned completely around, when the Lord of Mercy and Grace, intervened. The King is David. And, the married woman that he adored, was Bathsheba. Love and lust, for the things and people that one couldn't have. Willful adultery and forbidden lovemaking. Secret rendezvous and illegitimate pregnancy. Intrigue and cold-blooded murder. Are all..., within this deeply moving, true life, Old Testament, biblical love story that never should have been, but was! The Ten Commandments - they were the sacred Laws of God, as written upon stone tablets (Exodus 24:12 KJV). But, just as Adam and Eve weren't willing to obey one commandment (not to eat the fruit off of the selected tree), and mankind being what it is... David - as a man and a King, who was 'hand-picked' and anointed by the Lords' Prophet - Samuel, was to have kept and enforced the laws that comprised the Ten Commandments. But, for the love of one married woman, he - together with his beloved Bathsheba, ended up breaking just about every single law within the Ten Commandments, that were written by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18 KJV). The reason? David wanted to be truly loved - as a man, and not just as a wealthy Monarch. And for her part - Bathsheba, was  married off to a foreign man - Uriah, whom she barely knew and didn't love. Their combined factors made for the perfect 'forbidden love' scenario. Enter Hollywood with their scriptwriters, movie camera's and box office advertising. The result? An excellent and compelling drama that stuck to what was written within the Holy Bible, in their big-screen presentation of: DAVID AND BATHSHEBA. Actors - Susan Hayward and Gregory Peck, star in the leading roles and successfully transport the viewing audience 3,000 years B.C. when DAVID AND BATHSHEBA were actually living, breathing and very passionate lovers. This single-disc, color, DVD film production is scripturally sound and historically accurate and also, quite moving. Made in 1951 during Hollywood's Classic - Golden Age of Cinema, they evidently treated this motion picture and it's biblical contents, with reverence and respect. This 116-minute depiction of romance almost ruined... turned into love personified, is truly magnificent. All in all, it is biblical, historical, accurate, interesting and deeply moving. Hollywood truly deserves an A+ for having properly researched and for having made this film, like they did. If you've ever had a forbidden love affair or have a great desire too, than this film is for you. A definite, dramatic, keeper for your home DVD library collection.

8103675,4,B000E11252,"There's no shortage of bad dialog in David and Bathsheba - ""I was quite a hand with a slingshot,"" ""The King of all Israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy"" (full marks to Dennis Hooey for delivering that one with a straight face), ""Go and sit with the concubines."" And somehow I doubt a bored David ever told the prophet Nathan ""Whatever you say."" He even tries the old ""My kingdom doesn't understand me"" routine on desperate housewife Bathsheba at one point. So it's probably a tribute to Henry King's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide.

Maybe it's to play down the censor-baiting nature of the plot - a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it! - but King brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in Phillip Dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. This is the conflicted David on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful God he no longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty. It even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law, where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives.

Unlike King David, which sidelined the king in favor of the admittedly more interesting Saul, David is firmly at the center of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of Saul and Jonathan's death, Gregory Peck's performance grows in stature as David shrinks. Susan Hayward is pure Hollywood pro, Raymond Massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet (why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and Kieron Moore's Uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame David for putting him in harm's way, but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow David a moral get out of jail free card over his death. With surprisingly strong but subdued design and Technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s Biblical epics.

Fox's Region 1 NTSC DVD is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey `candid' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.",1304121600,,2419,4.9679012345679014
