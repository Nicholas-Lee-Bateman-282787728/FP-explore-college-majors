1243483,5,B00001AQZD,"The musical and historic value of this recording cannot be underestimated. It represented von Karajan's last public appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic. It is remarkable how relaxed, almost amiable he seems when considering the strained relations with the orchestra. I refer the reader to the Osborne biography for further details in this regard. Interestingly, Kissin is said to have wanted to play the concerto faster, but Karajan prevailed, and in my opinion chose tempos that befitted the grandeur and depth of this work, instead of allowing it to become yet another breakneck display of virtuosity of superficial musical value. I found the balance between the focus on Karajan, the musicians, and Kissin to be quite acceptable. There are solo recitals by Kissin on the market which will allow you to revel in his astounding talent. But the chance to see von Karajan weave his magic in his twilight years makes this worth buying in and of itself.",986083200,34,954,5.082802547770701
1243484,4,B00001AQZD,"Although this was a DVD showcasing Karajan, it was unfortunate that Kissin's virtuosic performance was severly neglected camera-wise. I've listened to this CD years ago, and I think it's one of the best  interpretation of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto no. 1 to date. While watching  this DVD, I felt robbed of seeing the young Kissin's virtuoso performance  of this highly difficult concerto. I wished Sony Classical could produce  another better DVD showcasing the then young Evgeny Kissin's amazing  talents. I would highly recommend this DVD for Karajan-admirers, but if  you're a Kissin-fan then trust me, you don't want to get it.",958780800,30,634,5.29
1243485,5,B00001AQZD,"This concerto includes Prokofiev's Classical Symphony No. 1 and Tchaikovsky's piano concerto No. 1 featuring Evgeny Kissin. Karajan is in very good mood despite the pain in his back that kept him leaning back  (instead of his customary forward position) in the special supporting  device prepared for him in the conductor's podium. The octave motif that  makes the main theme of the fisrt movement of Prokofiev's 1st is played  with almost comical accuracy, as if imitating Mozart. I never liked this  symphony before. Now, after listening this interpretation I really learned  to enjoy it. I have mixed feelings about the piano concerto. The young  Kissin (just a boy then) exudes so much adrenaline; you can see in the  little man's face the weight of being playing with the best orchestra in  the world, conducted by a living legend. He seems very aware that the last  recording of this concerto with Karajan-Berliner, was performed by no other  than Sviatoslav Richter. The performance, though, although not note  perfect, is very good. The only flaws were caused mostly by the boy excess  of energy. I listened this version on CD years ago, but in the video, the  boy generates such tension that it's almost distracting. The best part is  the last movement, were the boy's tension matches so well with the  character of the music. The final part is unforgettable, it keeps you at  the edge of the seat until the last chord. The DVD in a whole is very well  balanced and makes a wonderful experience.",953337600,48,1504,4.854330708661418
1243499,4,B00001AQZD,"This is a very important historical document in so far as it shows Karajan in a real concert situation as opposed to his various other `staged' productions of the same period. As a result we see far more of his evident enjoyment of the occasion and of the musical results he achieved with his orchestra as the concert proceeds. This, despite the obvious pain he is experiencing in this final part of his life evident as he is helped to the podium at the start of the concert.

What we then see is close attention to every nuance of the delivery of the music. This is achieved through minimal gesture of hand, finger, eyebrow or glance. The idea that he conducted exclusively with his eyes shut is here disproved. Instead, as The Gramophone Magazine once remarked, `his gimlet eye' misses nothing and the players respond with complete concentration throughout.

This is very much conductor in charge and not music making by group consensus. It is, of course, a bygone approach and typical of other such conductors - Reiner, Szell and others of that generation. It may also explain why so many of those earlier recordings by strong-willed conductors have survived into the modern age with interpretations that are revered as `classic' reference points.

This recording is also priceless insofar as the greater playing part of the disc features a very young Kissin performing the Tchaikovsky 1st Piano concerto with utter concentration and composure coupled with musicianship and technical skill. It is a remarkable achievement and Karajan is with him in totally close support all the way. Where the balance of interpretation lay, Kissin's, Karajan's or a mutual collaboration, it is impossible to say. Sufficient to report that the performance is deeply satisfying on its own terms - as indeed it is in the Prokofiev symphony that precedes it.

The recording is in completely serviceable sound for the period (1988). The imaging cannot deliver definition on long shots but is more than adequate for closer work which accounts for at least 95% of the total. For these technical reasons one has to drop a star but not for any other consideration. This is a fascinating record of an historically important time in the life of the B. P. O. with Karajan at the helm as well as documenting the emergence of one of the finest of the modern generation of pianists today. This disc is highly recommended on those terms therefore.",1342051200,5,2418,4.890243902439025
1243500,5,B00001AQZD,"Stunning performance of this work by Tchaikovsky and also to know it was only six months later that von Karajan passed away. The pianist is young but showing such brilliance. An absolute ""must-buy""!",1304294400,,198,5.03030303030303
1243501,5,B00001AQZD,"Von Karajan obviously enjoys conducting the Prokoviev, and it shows in the vivacity of the performance. Sometimes the pp passages are ppp, but all else is fine. The Tchaikovsky is an unusual performance, with much slower tempos and more deliberation during transitions (even pauses) than are generally found in this work. Probably played five minutes longer than Horowitz or Gilels would have required. The break between the 2nd and 3rd movements surprised me. The 17 year old pianist is excellent; he surely does like his deliberate, almost hesitant, tempos. Great clarity of finger attacks on keys, separation of notes. Remarkable, really. The camera could spend a bit more time on Kissin's hands and less on his and Herbert's faces.",1252022400,9,735,5.184873949579832
1243502,5,B00001AQZD,Marvelous version of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto #1. I know we will miss Herbert Von Karajan as conductor but Mr. Kissin is still around! Kissin was only 17 when this new years eve concert was recorded LIVE!,1204329600,,210,4.702702702702703
1243503,5,B00001AQZD,"I've always been a Tchaikovsky fan, but as a pianist I'd curiously been somewhat indifferent to PC1...until I heard/watched this Kissin/Karajan performance on youtube. I knew instantly I had to buy it. Apparently the boy wonder wanted it at the typical manic tempo, but the maestro insisted on expansiveness. The result is monumental.",1194393600,4,334,5.320754716981132
1243504,4,B00001AQZD,"This is a magnificent recording of the Tchaikovsky in many ways. The historical value, the terrific sound from the orchestra and the fact that this is Karajan's last concert with the BPO. The only negative for me is that I've never heard the Concerto ever played as slowly as this. It is almost distracting how slow it is. The positive is that most all of today's pianists play it too fast - so this is the other end of the spectrum. The Prokofiev is dazzling and lovely to hear.",1181865600,3,479,4.393258426966292
1243505,5,B00001AQZD,This is great but should've been longer about 1 hr 1/2 is Karajan conducting 1 piece and other 1/2 is Kissin performing w/orch. Kissin makes the dvd worth every cent.,1168128000,4,166,4.566666666666666
1243506,4,B00001AQZD,"This was Herbert Von Karajan's last appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic.  He is of course, the best and the recording a treasure.  His quiet passages may be a little too soft for some, but he is a Master Conductor whom I understand delighted in encouraging young artistes.  Mr. Evgeny Kissin, a teenager of about 15 at this time is astounding.  His technical prowess and strength unbelievable for one so young, and his passion and musicianship superb!  I bought this DVD strictly for the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 and can recommend it without reservation as an inspiration for young musicians, as well as other adult fans of Russian Music. To solo a piano concerto with the Berlin Philharmonicer at 15 - astounding!",1140652800,9,726,4.918032786885246

1243508,4,B00001AQZD,"I'm so disappointed because of poor vision of this DVD. There's no question about performance of Kissin, Karajan, or BP, but the cameras focused most the time on Karajan or Kissin's face instead of his hands. That why I just give this DVD 4 starts.",1111968000,9,248,4.533333333333333

7914364,5,B00001AQZD,"I am not a pianist, I do not read music, but I have listened to and enjoyed a number of recordings and live performances of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No 1.  This DVD contains one of the most moving interpretations of this wonderful piece of music.  Despite being recorded in 1988, the sound is clear with good fidelity and dynamic range.  The images are clear.  I was so taken with Mr, Kissin's performance that I watched and listened to it at least five times in a row.  In contrast to some of the other reviewers I was not bothered by the video image choices made.  I thought that the balance between soloist, conductor, orchestra and concert hall were fine.",1395273600,2,665,4.546218487394958
7914365,4,B00001AQZD,"Von Karajan's magnificent work with the Berlin Philharmonic is well known as is his battle with soloists who were not an integral part of 'his' organization.  The Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto was one of the works that, as witness his recordings, always seemed to provoke disagreements with his soloists.  The same is true here.  On the other hand, the disagreements sparked performances of excitement.  That is also true here.  Kissin plays brilliantly and the orchestra performs up to their usual high standards and the result is an exciting performance of this much performed work. The other music is also performed beautifully ... up to the orchestra's high standards.",1366070400,,675,5.212962962962963
7914366,5,B00001AQZD,"There is a near-unanimity among those who have reviewed this DVD that the performance of the 17-year-old pianist ranks with that of any of the giants of the keyboard of any age. With this assessment, I am in full agreement, and for me his phenomenal playing was even more wondrous as, without knowing his true age when I first played the disc, he looked to me no older than a Bar-mitzvah boy. Karajan's contribution has also attracted a wealth of favourable comment, deservedly so. It is the first disc of the many I have from this Sony Legacy series where he raises his eyes from the floor and actually opens them. He even manages to replace his perpetual scowl with the occasional smile and expression of joy. I would like to think that this was the result of his astonishment at his soloist's prowess as much as the occasion itself ---- Christmas Eve in the Philharmonie. The BPO responded magnificently to his direction, and though the overall pace was slower than usual, this allowed the music to shine with majestic grandeur, and made one oblivious of the moments of vulgarity to which the composer succumbed. In short, the finest orchestral account of this work, bar none. Put this soloist and orchestra together and you have as close to a definitive version of this work as I have heard, and the sound quality does it full justice. Some reviewers have criticized the camera work as old-fashioned, but I strongly disagree. Kissen's fingerwork gets plenty of exposure, and a good balance is maintained between soloist, conductor and orchestra. The utter excitement of this triumphant performance could not be better conveyed by Large, Burton or anyone else using state-of-the-art equipment. Worth every one of 5 stars. The only deficit I felt was the cutting short of the applause at the end. This is a big factor in creating the illusion of being actually present in the flesh, and I missed it badly.

In this context, one can regard Prokofiev's 1st Symphony as something of a bonus. Again, it is awfully well played, with Karajan and the BPO once more on top of their form, but there were times when I felt that the weight of the orchestra was too heavy for the score. It is the essence of lightness and good humour, intended to add a modern dress to the symphonic music of the Mozart/Haydn era. One hundred instrumentalists is way too many.",1357603200,3,2349,4.729268292682927
