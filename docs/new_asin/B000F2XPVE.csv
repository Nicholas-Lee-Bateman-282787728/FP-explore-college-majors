8116626,5,B000F2XPVE,"INTRODUCTION:

This is the second of three DVDs in the I Am That I Am series. The first one focuses on the teaching of Nisargadatta Maharaj as understood by Stephen Wolinsky.

In the opening sequence of this DVD we see one after another the photos of Nisargadatta, Gurdjieff, Alfred Korzybski, Wittgenstein, Jacques Derrida, and Wolinsky. This tells the viewer that Wolinsky is bringing together the teachings of the others. It also suggests that Wolinsky stands on his own as a teacher and thinker.

The teaching in this video belongs more to Wolinsky than anyone else. The frames we saw in the first video, featuring quotations by Nisargadatta Maharaj, now bear quotations from Wolinsky himself.

However, Nisargadatta lives in this video through the sutra that he spoke and which infected Wolinsky: ""Fluids come together and the I Am appears."" Wolinsky's work is the processing of that sutra toward emptiness and form, at once, and through such themes as linguistics, quantum physics, biology, Yoga, Buddhism, Advaita.

DECONSTRUCTION:

Stephen Wolinsky treats nonduality as deconstruction. Anything else is a soft nonduality tripping on beingness, the I Am, consciousness, God, etc. While many teachers set forth a soft nonduality - you almost have to, and Wolinsky himself does - it is best kept on a short leash attached to the dog house of deconstruction. Wolinsky speaks of post-deconstruction, actually, or deconstruction of the ""I,"" death of the ""I,"" or extinction.

Death of the I, nirvana as extinction, are the bottom line themes of this film. Wolinsky brings 2500 years of spiritual tradition and philosophy to collapse the I. Without the I, Wolinsky notes, all systems fall apart. There's nothing to transform. That's where this DVD takes you.

ABSTRACTION AND TRANSDUCTION:

The nervous system abstracts information and transduces it. That is, there is mostly emptiness. The nervous system omits the emptiness so a solid world is seen and known. It also transduces as it abstracts, changing noise to sound, sound to words, words to meaning.

Wolinsky repeats in different ways that existence is an abstraction of nothing. Abstraction is a way to organize chaos. He says, ""The I and all language and what it means, occurs through the abstraction and transduction process. Hence all language and the truth or falsity of what it claims is a linguistic metaphoric representation of nothing.""

He also says, ""Prior to the abstraction and transduction process, there is no I, me, or mine, and hence no location, organizing or creative source, or starting point for psychology or spirituality.

OTHER THEMES WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE FILM:

Yoga: one of most important teachings or realizations is that there is no doer.

Quantum physics: ""The I with its concept of volition and free will and intention arises through a nuclear exchange,"" says Wolinsky.

Linguistics: ""There are no ready made ideas outside of language."" Ferdinand de Saussure.

Buddhism: Nagarjuna's dependent origination says not only is there no separate self or soul, but everything arises as one substance, as a fluid motion. Nothing arises independently, Wolinsky explains.

MEDITATION:

In one of several meditations, Wolinsky asks you to put on a quantum lens (which sees almost all space and an occasional particle) to look inward rather than out. He guides you (roughly quoting): ""Get a sense of the I as emptiness. Get a sense of the witness as condensed emptiness. Notice what occurs if the witness of the emptiness and the emptiness are made of the same substance. Witness the emptiness. Condense some emptiness to a thought such I love myself. Now thin out the thought to emptiness. Let the emptiness condense and form I hate myself. Have them both as the same emptiness.""

The meditations are deep and persistent. This is how you can experience nonduality, or go beyond experience.

SANTA FE TALK:

One track is a talk given in Santa Fe. Wolinsky reviews all the themes of this DVD, repeats some teachings and stories, and includes insights into the personality of Nisargadatta and how he was a very direct and not a popular teacher.

I found interesting the material on student-centered vs. teacher-centered spirituality. The former is concerned about the students, sending them where they need to be. The latter tries to build-up the teacher and his organization.

Wolinsky makes the point that this work is about finding out who you are not, not about healing or making your life better. It's not about making a better mirage.

QUESTIONS TRACK:

He answers basic questions: Is there God after post deconstruction? If there is no karma, is there destiny? Is this teaching nihilism? Who you are if nothing perceivable or conceivable? Why are we here? What is enlightenment? Who am I?

Wolinsky uses the teachings from the film to answer these questions, thus is it a useful addition.

THE ULTIMATE DECONSTRUCTION:

There's a potential spoiler here so I won't say much. Wolinsky asserts that spirituality is about finding out who you are. On that path, he says, avoid any system that is not willing to deconstruct itself. Teachers might say the same about students.

CONCLUSION:

If you learn most easily through visual and audio cues, by all means get these videos from Neti Neti. Or start with one. Or visit the Neti Neti site and view a sample first.

I don't think there's any question that if you watch one of these videos, do the enquiries and meditations, and simply listen, that ""who you think you are"" - the ""I"" -- will thin quite a bit. Wolinsky is very effective. You may even want to take a workshop with him.",1219795200,5,5606,5.041170097508125
8116627,5,B000F2XPVE,"It was with joy and surprise to discover this has become a series and that there are now a No. 2 & a No. 3 DVD available from NETINETI FILMS!  In the no. 2 DVD ""Nirvana"",  Stephen Wolinsky continues to elaborate on Advaita.  Books are wonderfull but the spoken word heard and seen of a living disciple of the enlightened master Nisargadatta Maharaj is an uncommon event which has an energy, inflection and assured articulation esp. when concerned with enigmas like the Ultimate Understandings of reality.  This Volume is fully packed with treats, special effects, and surprises, such as an excerpt from S.Wolinsky's excellent seminar in Santa Fe NM in 2005. Also, 8 more original discourses, five guided meditations, and Q&A, and rare footage of the Master.  Stephen Wolinsky is a good speaker and in this presentation continues in his gentle and thoughtful way to share analogies, anecdotes, and personal experiences of his travels and he always fully articulates the terms and meanings of his teacher. Each person should take away their own conclusions from the discourses. I make no judgements on the teachings. A wonderful thing is that so much material is enclosed that it can be enjoyed over and over and regarded  as a reference and a collectors item since Advaita discourses on video are rare. And as Stephen  leads the meditations, the listener is quickly and effortlessly ushered into the ""no thought"" state. That ""no thought"" space is The I AM.  The I AM does not imply realization but is a pointer.  Neti neti!",1187395200,4,1522,4.891050583657588
8116628,5,B000F2XPVE,"Part Two of ""I am that I am"" is a very good reason to buy Part 1. The presentation by Wolinsky, filmed by Maurizio Benazzo can not get much clearer when it comes to a presentation of Nisargadatta Maharaj's actualities of what is actual. Wolinsky does a great job of presenting what the real issues are when it comes to understanding what this is and of what and who you really are. This dvd is the closest thing you may find to a short cut when it comes to wading through the ever increasing amount of misinformation now appearing about  Nisargadatta and Advaita and non duality. Highly Recommended",1145059200,10,598,4.537037037037037
8116629,5,B000F2XPVE,"The ultimate confrontation, the ultimate bliss

If DVD 1 was a warmup, nothing could have prepared me for the power and depth of the second DVD.

Dr. Wolinsky takes us through several contexts, which include everything from science to philosophy, all which he shows validates the most profound teachings of Buddhism, Tantric yoga and Yoga.

I do caution the viewer. This is not a DVD for people who are into any form of new age belief system. This DVD will forever transmit a questioning process that will lead you to the essence of spirituality, which somehow I forgot, I had been caught up in trying to make myself more spiritual according to some template, forgetting that it was about finding out who you are.

What astounds me most, is that Dr. Wolinsky uses scientific metaphors, and then even deconstructs them as neti-neti, NOT THIS--NOT THIS.

I can only say that this DVD really deeply touched me as none other. For sure it will upset many, and push buttons. BUT in the end this DVD, is a study into finding out who you are, and the more I listen and watch and use this material, the more the need for satsang disappears. In fact, I am now experiencing that these two DVD's taken together are so powerful, that you might never need satsang again.",1144540800,13,1256,4.614349775784754
8116630,5,B000F2XPVE,"This is not a DVD that you can watch once.  If you are looking for lots about Nisargadatta; this is not for you but if you are looking for a variety of schools of thought that back up some of Maharaj's statements - this is it.  Wolinsky patiently explains/quotes about this woven world we have created.  Part 1 and 2 are so different, it's hard to compare. This DVD is absolutely incredible to me for my path of learning.  I will always be indebted to this man who is really me.  HA!  He starts off with, ""if I want a drink of water and get and get it."" In reality I actually get up and get the water before the thought appears.""  Statements like that which he explains where he got the info - is what is so facinating.

8116631,5,B000F2XPVE,"I have studied with Stephen Wolinsky as a therapist and as a friend. He has the courrage to reveal to us the real and give us the opportunity to move beyond the myths stories and lies of whatever culture, philosohy, psychology, religion, or country we happen to be stuck in. The person is imaginary and with that imagination comes the story of who you are ,what you'll become and all sorts of adventures. When we free the consciousness of the story of who we are ,we are also free from whom we are not. As Stephen says there is not one substance for if there is one substance there must be a seperate perceiver to say there is one. This is not for the weak or those without courage. The sharing of the fruits of being with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj are the fruits of life and truth,snd may we all be blessed to receive it and let it grow. As Stephen once told me,when I asked ""What will I get from this workshop ? and He replied Nothing, I hope. Perhaps you will have fewer ideas than you have now>"" Then I did not fully understand what he meant and now I may.
