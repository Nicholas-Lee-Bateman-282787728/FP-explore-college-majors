7936617,5,B00005AVS2,"Crest of the Stars was hard to appreciate when I first sat down to watch it. The story is very complex and in depth with a lot of unexpected interaction between the characters. So, at first glance, I didn't really care much for it.
However, after watching it again, this time more carefully, I realized that I began to really care for the characters and the overall storyline. I have since purchased volumes one thru three and I love them all. I definitely recommend this series to anyone who has a passion for outerspace and character developement.",1012694400,,549,4.670103092783505
7936618,5,B00005AVS2,"I love this series. It is set in an incredibly rich, diverse world and told in a powerful, compelling manner. The series shows its novel roots in so many areas, from the detail devoted to the Abh culture to the explanations of some of the sci-fi principles that underly this universe. It is hard to summarize, but the best way I would describe it is as an exploration of the Abhs as a culture and the conflict that occurs when human and Abh meet. The story is told through the experiences of Jinto, a human, and the Abh Lafiel as they are forced by fate into a journey together.
This second disc focuses mostly on the Abh, explaining their feudal system, noble lineage, vassals, relationships, etc. It is also where you learn a great deal about Lafiel's background and her way of thinking, making her more human to us, yet showing us just how differently the Abh behaves compared to normal humans. There is also a great space battle in the first episode of this disc, but it is so deftly woven into the story that it leaves the viewer moved by it.
Sadly, Jinto appears rather useless in this disc :). Not to worry, Lafiel more than makes up for him in this one (I'd hate to get on her bad side) and Jinto will have his time in the later discs.
This series is definitely different from the standard space anime fair. It lacks the light humor of Nadesico or Captain Tylor and is far more character focused that Gundam. Action is not the focus - some episodes contain no battles whatsoever. But it tells an incredibly good story, one that will draw you in until you cannot help but feel for the characters and cheer them on as they grow.",1003881600,3,1634,4.396039603960396
