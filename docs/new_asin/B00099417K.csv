8058436,4,B00099417K,"This movie starts out with a girl being kidnapped and then fed to a tentacled, one-eyed monster.  Then her sister shows up looking for her, and the police inform her that several other girls have also disappeared recently.  And they all lived at the Halfway House.  So the sister goes undercover to discover what hidden secrets this place may harbor.

There's not a whole lot of plot here - the sister goes to the Halfway House, gets a rather rude reception from the girls there, and spies on the nun and priest who run the place.  The other girls have sex with each other, take showers, and occasionally try to run away, which always ends with them being eaten by the monster in the basement.  There is a LOT of nudity in this.  The acting wasn't at all bad for such a low budget movie, and...well...did I mention there was a lot of nudity?

Overall, if you're in the mood for a really cheesy B movie with lots of naked girls, you'll probably enjoy this.  If you're looking for a horror movie, forget it - it isn't the least bit scary.",1261785600,2,1036,4.382198952879581
8058437,5,B00099417K,I'm not a huge fan of Horror Movies but if you like to be scared out of your pants and hear naked girls screaming from their bodies while the scary monster eats them like Sushi. This Movie Is Right For You but If You Don't like to be scared and this movie offends you in abusing women like objects of desire don't buy this movie if you have children in the house. It's Only for Mature Adults Only.,1169424000,,397,4.102564102564102
8058438,4,B00099417K,"At Mary Madeleine's, a place for girls in trouble, there have been a number of mysterious disappearances.  But when a young woman disappears near the house the police get involved in an investigation.  The missing girls's sister goes in undercover.  There she runs into the head Nun, Mary Woronov (in a major role for a recent change), and a priest with a spanking fetish.  Although we get to see what happens to the missing girl right at the beginning of the film, our heroes have  to work it out for themselves.

The Necronomicon, a horribly powerful book, has been stolen and is now in the house.  It can open a doorway to the Great Old Ones who wish to rule our world destroy humanity.  The justification for why someone would want to help these beings was actually quite well thought out.  Who survives, who doesn't, and what happens to the thing in the gateway will have to be left to the viewer to discover.

This is a better film than I had expected.  It was a pleasure to see Mary Woronov in a major role again (and not in extended cameos like in Frog-g-g).  We get to see the horrible monster right at the start which is a little unusual (but helps build the plot).  Although not quite a women's prison movie, it has many of the same elements including plenty of nudity, a shower scene, lesbians, tough chicks, and sex scenes.  Add to that a pretty decent plot building upon the works of H.P. Lovecraft and you get a pretty interesting and entertaining little horror film.  Check it out.",1168128000,4,1497,4.492592592592593

8058440,5,B00099417K,"This is a GREAT movie. This genre (campy, exploitation, horror) is usually disappointing but not this time. This one's got it all: evil nuns, hot naked chicks, spanking, creepy janitors, and over the top monsters. And the cast is perfect. There should be more movies like this...When is the sequel for Halfway House?",1157328000,3,316,4.981132075471698
8058441,3,B00099417K,"A well-made B-movie with a bountiful supply of nudity,lesbianism, and monster molestation. If this appeals to you keep reading: quality of the actors ranges greatly. The basic plot centers around the disappearance of women and the main character played by Tracy Keijster investigating the disappearance of her sister. Catholics be warned: contains material that could be offensive. Lastly, don't go expecting original screenplays or ideas as the director stated that he wanted to take a potpurri of his favorite films/scenes and create an homage of sorts.",1154822400,6,555,5.465116279069767
8058442,5,B00099417K,"This is the greatest film of 2006. Forget ""Brokeback Mountain""; if you want artful depravity then buy this monumental film.",1141948800,4,123,5.2
8058443,3,B00099417K,"Lets face it, in todays world of horror its tough to come up with something new or different. In the big budget market we are being promised tons of remakes to old horror flicks from the past. I know remakes aren't the most popular topic and I can understand the pain of seeing something go straight to hell. Well ladies and gentlemen there is a solution, its called independent films. Yes including some of the direct to video stuff you're used to seeing at your local video store. If you search really hard you can find something good and entertaining. The Halfway House is an independent horror film which is filled with violence, humor, lust and of course one eyed monsters.

The story is about a woman named Larissa who is in search of her lost sister. Larissa teams up with a cop and they soon discover that there have been many other disappearances surrounding women staying at a catholic house. Larissa then goes undercover at the Halfway House only to discover that there is much more going on than what she sees. I would speak more about the plot but I don't want to ruin too much for you guys, its just something that you have to see for yourself. The Halfway House is a really good film filled with some interesting characters. Cops, lesbians,creepy nuns, a perverted handyman, a priest who has a hard on for spanking and of course a monster who loves to eat half naked girls. I loved the cool characters and the incredible cast of actors as well. I found the movie to be very enjoyable and I actually had a fun time watching it.

My heart goes out to all the actors and staff behind this film. I was pretty amazed by the cinematography and I couldn't help but love the way it was filmed. In parts the movie actually brought back some familiar feelings I had when I grew up as a kid watching flicks like the evil dead and re-animator. This movie also has the old school animatronic monster fx which was a big highlight in my childhood. This film has none of that cgi bull crap that we are seeing more of today. Kenneth Hall does a great job of paying homage to classics films from the past. As you watch the film you can tell that he was influenced very much by older horror films and as I said before it definitely brings back those old memories. Hall also does a great job of keeping things realistic. This movie doesn't go over the top with the gore or the monsters, instead everything is kept to a steady and fluid pace.

Overall The Halfway House is a well made and really entertaining film. The story is good, the characters are great and theres plenty of violence to boot. Its always great to see something different and The Halfway House delivers all the good stuff. I enjoyed the film very much and will be sitting down to watch it all over again. This dvd also includes some cool special features. Theres audio commentary with writer/director Kenneth J. Hall and producer Ed Polgary, deleted scenes, A making of featurette, uncensored trailer and a really cool music video from the band Insecto Circus. Its really good stuff and I definitely recommend this movie to fans who have a heart for the old stuff, or if you just want to watch something different. Just remember kids, the power of christ compels you!",1125014400,8,3231,4.491496598639456
