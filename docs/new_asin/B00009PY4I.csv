1887818,5,B00009PY4I,"MGM has done an admirable job for this new Double Feature DVD. It contains both Troll and Troll 2, both presented in Animorphic Widescreen with their original theatrical trailers. The picture and sound are as good as we're ever going to see these two films on DVD. I applaud MGM for giving good treatment to little known films such as these. They could have just as easily slapped on Full-Frame transfers and no Trailers. Plus, MGM offers both movies for a very affordable price. Even if you hate one of the Troll movies, this DVD is still very worthwhile to buy for the one you do like.
TROLL was released in the mid-1980's when I was still a kid growing up. One of the earlier films from Charles Band and Empire Pictures, predating the later Full Moon pictures. I first saw TROLL on HBO, and for some reason thought it was a great fantasy/horror film. Sure it was low budget, but very memorable even to this day. It features an early acting performance from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and also a very funny appearance by Sonny Bono.
TROLL 2 I had the pleasure of first viewing on video in the early 1990's when it was released. It really has nothing at all to do with the first TROLL movie as far as the plot goes and the production team. This is not a bad thing since TROLL 2 has an offbeat, cultish originality which is rarely seen in very many movies anymore. TROLL 2 was obviously a very low budget production and the acting is often horrible, but therein lies it's charm. It is one of those movies that is so bad it's good. Some people will love it and others will hate it. I personally think it's a classic cheesy movie!",1061942400,8,1622,4.41
1887819,5,B00009PY4I,"I can hardly contain myself! This movie (both movies) are being re-released on DVD?!? I saw the second one first back in 91/92 on HBO and I thought it was the greatest movie ever. This movie is the reason why I watch all the movies I do today. (1970's Italian Horror, Troma, 30's-50's B&W Horrors) Later, much later like 6 years after that I finally came across the first Troll at my local movie rental store. Sad to say but the sequal killed the original. Lately there has been a re-release of ""Troll II"" by a little company that restores old cheap movies to DVD floating around.... I almost bought it until I heard of this.

1887820,5,B00009PY4I,Troll 2 was a movie so poorly done and the acting was so awful that you actually have to watch it.  You will laugh out loud when you see what I am talking about.  Worth its weight in gold.,1057449600,,188,3.7948717948717947
1887821,4,B00009PY4I,"Troll is without a doubt the best of its genre.  The genre I'm referring to, however, is ""Horror Movies So Bad That They're Unitentionally Funny.""  I have watched an untold amount of horrible horror movies in my day, and this one has brought me to tears (the good king) unlike any other.  From Lassie's mom as a witch with an inexplicable talking plant, to Sonny Bono's classic demise, to the operatic interlude, this movie is unbelievable.  You must watch this movie!
The only reason I'm not giving this movie five stars is because the sequel isn't fantastic, probably three stars, though it does have its moments.",1055721600,2,615,4.773584905660377
1887822,5,B00009PY4I,"Troll: 3/5
Troll is really entertaining! Well acted, even by the kids, or at least not as bad as other kid actors. Somewhat over-the-top storyline, with cheesy dialogue, at times, and pretty good direction. Not to spectacular on camera work, but as far as special effects were at the time, stood out.

Troll 2: 2/5
Troll 2 is SUPER entertaining! Below par acting, from child and adult actors alike. Extremely over-the-top storyline, with almost incomprehensible dialogue and plot-line. Poor direction, with camera work that is adequate, but doesn't make up for the ""special"" effects, or lack there of.

Blu-ray Quality: 4/5
Troll is newly remastered, and looks great! Troll 2 also looks great, however nothing different than the original 20th Century Fox blu-ray release. No new art work on the cover, the cover is just the original poster/VHS (cover) art. Special features are somewhat lacking, but that's to be expected of the ""Scream Factory: Double Features"" line.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Troll-Troll-2-Blu-ray/dp/B0145UQS7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Troll / Troll 2 [Blu-ray</a>]",1489276800,,1136,5.920731707317073

1887825,5,B00009PY4I,"I remember when I was a kid and saw the trailer on tv for Troll.  I didn't really know what to make of what I was seeing except that I figured it to be an odd comedy or something.  Well as I saw it the very next year, I noticed some weirdness and some eerie and scary monsters, plus some ""what just happened?"" moments as well.  I did prove entertaining nonetheless, whatwith it's weirdness, having kids in it, and campy elements.  As for Troll 2 well it was a really long time before I ever got to see it.  Back in 2002 I went to a big VHS sale at a video store and as well as several other movies Troll 2 became among the ones that I bought that weekend.  After viewing Troll 2 it didn't take me long for me to be into it.  The horror element, weirdness, (this time) higher level of camp, and supernatural element were all there as they were in the first movie and a bit more; even as it neither had anything to do with the first Troll and was about Goblins instead.

Troll
This one classic, campy, and strange mid-80's horror movie that even as it has a very short running time, it still proves to leave quite an indelible impression on the viewer.  The movie focuses on a geeky avid b-movie and Star Trek lover named  Harry Potter, Jr(no connection with JK Rowling, just a coincidence) whose parents have recently moved to this apartment building full of very odd people.  Harry's little sister, Wendy plays around with her rubber ball as she follows it down to a basement and comes back behaving very strangely.  Not sure what to do, Harry proves fortunate enough to run into an eccentric witch by the name of Eunice St. Claire(June Lockhart).  Once Eunice decides that she trusts Harry, she tells him all about the war between the humans and the trolls, about the lead troll Taurok(Phil Fondacaro), and about how her wizard friend became a talking mushroom in a flower pot.  No sooner does Hatrry come to know this as Taurok and his band of trolls start causing shear mayhem in the apartment building leaving Harry to not only save humanity, but his sister as well.

Troll while by no means a perfect horror movie, is nostalgic, funny/campy, interesting, unique, features great puppets and costumes, the acting is pretty good, it's really frightening, and that eerie theme song in the troll's language is an ear worm that is bound to send shivers down your spine.  It features such actors as Phil Fondacaro(Ghoulies 2), June Lockhart(tv's Lost in Space), Noah Hathaway(Boxie from tv's Battlestar Galactica(1978), Sonny Bono(tv's Sonny and Cher), and Michael Moriarty(The Stuff, Q-The Winged Serpent,etc.)

Troll 2

While as we all know this movie is actually about Goblins and has nothing at all to do with the first Troll movie, it still proves entertaining.  Yeah this may be one really bad and corny horror b-movie, but it's very good for a laugh as well as having an interesting enough story, a few attractive people, one gem of a musical score, and most of all you can't honestly say that there's a b-horror comedy movie that is quite like this one.

It's about this family who decide to go to the country by switching houses for a month with a strange farming family.  The young son Joshua, is told a story by his grandpa Seth about vegetarian goblins can change people into a slimy vegetable substance to eat them.  Little does Joshua's family realize how very real that story of goblins really is nor how good the goblins are at disguising themselves as human beings.  Along the way, Joshua's beautiful and hot sister Holly gets stood up by her boyfriend Elliot to go to the farm community of Nilbog where the whole family is going to, only to take his van along with his guy friends and follow them there.  Well unfortunately the goblins aren't far behind and are looking for more people to add to their personal salad bar.  It's up to Joshua and the ghost of his grandfather to save them now.

Overall, if you enjoy a scary movie with a b-movie style and some laugh out loud camp to it, then both of these movies are the way to go.  While Troll has much better special effects and acting, it's still very frightening and totally campy as well.  It's pure and simple 80's style horror and humor all throughout.  As for Troll 2 well while the title is misleading being that its about goblins and not trolls nor does it have even the littlest bit to do with the first movie, it's still very much worth seeing for its silliness and camp value in its self.  It simply must be seen to be believed.  The documentary known as,""The Best Worst Movie is also an entertaining must see as well.  In closing, for any 80's horror fan and/or big fan of scary yet campy movies that are so bad that they're good these two movies are a must!",1485561600,,4737,4.504093567251462

The first movie played reasonably well, but Troll 2, the main reason I bought the collection, wouldn't play at all on my DVD player. Admittedly my DVD player is older and getting finicky, so it won't play DVDs with even small scratches or imperfections, but I'm not sure if the playback issues were a result of the DVD surface being scratched, or the coding quality of the data on the disc.

i personally prefer Ghoulies which is much better Empire pictures production
and has also been given a new blu-ray reissue by scream factory with all new retrospect making of Doco
and new HD transfer & new 2.0 master audio mix go check the listing on amazon.com
anyway about TROLL, pretty Good thriller with some Medieval themes thrown into the mix
the HD transfer for Troll looks very Good but not excellent, still the picture quality has been cleaned up
sharper than the old 2001 MGM DVD version
the sound quality is excellent with a new 2.0 master audio mix, again much better than the old Dolby digital mix

about the extras, a new retrospective making of Doco has been given-50mins long
new interviews with Director John Beauchler, Charles band
and some of the behind the scenes crew like the special make up effects people have been interviewed
the production Designers & costume designer have been interviewed
tragically for some reason none of the Actors were interviewed,
no new interviews with Jenny beck who played Wendy potter
no new interviews with Noah Hathaway or Shelley Hack or Michael moriarity
there's also Photo Gallery, and the original trailer, TV spots
TROLL 2 has been given the same HD treatment as Troll 1
the only special feature is a new Audio commentary with Actors George Hardy & Deborah reed
the 2 films are on 1 Blu-ray Disc,
the 2nd Disc is a bonus DVD BEST WORST MOVIE which is about the films Legacy of Troll 2-90mins
filmed both in 1:85:1 ratio & 1:33:1 ratio
because the footage has interviews with the cast & crew from 1989 which is 1:33:1 fullscreen ratio
has footage of scenes being filmed, footage of the special effects artists doing the troll make up etc
also has interviews with the fans of the Troll 2 and the big problems that occured during filiming the movie

1887857,5,B00009PY4I,"Charles Band has made some bad movies in his long-ongoing career and he's made some decent ones. Troll falls some where in between. Unfortunately it's left in the shadows due to the false popularity of its ""sequel"" Troll 2. I say false because A) it's only famous because of how bad it is and due to the ""oh my god"" guy meme. B) People don't genuinely like it. While it's neat to see a cult film receive recognition, Troll 2 really doesn't deserve it. Cult films like Basket Case and Evil Dead deserved their attention because they were made with sincerity. Troll 2 was just made for the purpose of money and to cash in on the minor success of Band's film. It's similar to Silent Night, Deadly Night and the popularity of its bad but fun sequel. The difference is Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 has minor qualities to it which I feel makes it re-watchable. All this in mind, Troll 2 really doesn't deserve to be called 'best worst movie"" as there are far better ones out there.

Troll (1986):

Plot: The Potter family has just moved into an apartment complex. One in which a troll resides in for world domination. He begins his conquest with the family's daughter and then moves from apartment to apartment as he forms an army of trolls...

Troll was made during the heyday of Charles Band's Empire Pictures, which became famous for Ghoulies and Re-Animator. The film was directed by special effects wizard John C. Buechler, ho worked on Cellar Dweller and Dungeonmaster. The film stars Michael Moriarty famous for mostly playing in Larry Cohen productions like The Stuff and Q. It also stars Noah Hathaway, famous for The Neverending Story. Charles Band produced the film and his brother, Richard Band scored it.

Review: Troll isn't a great film nor is it a terrible film. The effects and sets are all pretty damn good. However the acting is varied with some over the top performances and some really weak ones. It's certainly a ""so bad it's good"" movie. What makes it work are its effects, original story, atmosphere and strangely likeable but bizarre characters. Richard Band's score is actually pretty good too but not as amazing as his scores for Re-Animator and House on Sorority Row.

Troll 2 (1989):

Plot: A family moves to a town called Nilbog (how very unassuming) and becomes concerned when the locals behave strangely.

Troll 2 as directed by Claudio Fragasso, who made the enjoyably bad-Monster Dog (1984). It was produced by Joe D'Amato famous for the terrific Italian horror classics, Beyond the Darkness (1979) and Anthropophagous (1980). It stars nobody worth mentioning except for Robert Ormsby, who was a good man and not that bad of an actor.

Review: Troll 2 has no connections to its predecessor and should've been called Goblin(s). There are no trolls, no recurring actors or crew members, no returning characters or plot elements. I have a like/hate relationship with this movie. It has some interesting elements like a town where people are disguised as monsters but it has way too many issues. None of the characters are likeable or enjoyable except for Grampa Seth, who has little screen time. Robert Ormsby actually tries and succeeds at giving a decent performance. Everybody else either tries and fails or barely tries at all. The dialogue is bad and the story is so bizarre that it becomes ridiculously absurd. The effects are lousy except for the guy on fire and the green vegetable slime. The pacing varies a lot and really hinders the enjoyability of the film's awfulness. There are movies that are so bad they're good like Saturday the 14th and then there are movies that are just bad followed by movies that are so abysmally bad like Manos the hands of blah blah blah. Troll 2 falls some where in between the latter two. It has its enjoyably bad or absurd moments like the Goblins eating green goop or the dinner scene or Seth's scenes but they're minor and are undermined by the film's overall cheap terrible qualities. It's slightly fun but fairly dull at times. Surprisingly though, the town and scenery is nice at least.

The DVD: It's a 2 sided disc with Troll on side A and Troll 2 on side B.

Final Thoughts: Troll is certainly a cult classic. Troll 2 is a classic of bad movies. Troll 2 has received unfair notoriety with a special edition Blu ray and dvd as well as being featured in a documentary. Both are suited for the b-movie crowd. However, Troll has better quality and is re-watchable. Where as Troll 2 is not re-watchable. All in all Troll 2 isn't my cup of tea when it comes to bad movies as absurdly lovably bad it is, it just doesn't have enough charms.

Ratings:
Troll-3/5, Troll is a genuine b-movie worthy of enjoyment.
Troll 2-2/5, Troll 2 is a terrible movie with only minor enjoyability.

1887874,3,B00009PY4I,"This rating is strictly in regard to the physical DVD and Double Feature 'package deal'. I would recommend these movies to anyone, but not so much this product.

For $45.00 I'd expect a little more than a double sided DVD that you would find on an end cap at a grocery store for $9.99. It's not uncommon that double sided DVDs have freeze up issues, even with no visible blemishes. I avoid purchasing these if at all possible. Unfortunately this is the only way you can currently own 'Troll' on DVD. ('Troll 2' is readily available.) There are no special features or extras whatsoever. I'd suggest looking for a reasonably priced used copy. Take your chances, but be prepared to have to return/exchange it because it froze up 15 minutes from the end of the movie. If this product consisted of 2 individual disks and perhaps a couple bonus featurettes, I would have given it a very enthusiastic 5 stars.

'Troll' is a decent, 80s, family friendly, fantasy/horror flick. It surely isn't Oscar worthy, but I'd say it is a step above 'B movie'.
'Troll 2' is a hot mess! WatchMojo.com named it one of the ""Top 10 Movies that are so bad they're good."" It's about goblins, not trolls. The plot is jaw-droppingly horrible.

Troll I is a completely different movie. For starters, it *actually* has a troll in it. It also features the magical adventures of Harry Potter Junior. I AM NOT KIDDING. Twenty years before Rowling published her much-loved character, this movie gives us Harry Potter jr, whose family has just moved to a strange old house in San Francisco, where Harry meets a cranky old shape-shifting witch who promises to teach him the arts of wizardry. It's just a coincedence, but funny to think about.

1887925,5,B00009PY4I,"In producing Troll 2, director Charles Brand has created a sensitive, balanced portrayal of the contrasting elements of modern urban and rural dwelling.

A cinematic tour-de-force, Troll 2 deftly interweaves themes of survival, greed, love, betrayal and redemption in a cohesive, forthright and profoundly affecting manner.

Starring an ensemble cast of the finest acting talents of the 1980's, Troll 2 allegorizes the conflicting notions of good and evil through an inspired and superior narrative. As a rich tapestry of sub plots evolve over the duration of the film, the viewer is led to question the value of his own existence, and the nature of the soul.

The cinematography is appropriately epic, with sweeping backdrops and panoramic vistas serving to symbolize the scope and grandeur of the tale.

An original and sympathetic score, composed by the celebrated producer Carlo Maria Condio, underpins Troll 2. Movements within the score such as 'The Girl Falls Into a Vegetable State', 'Mommy Got Eaten' and 'Josh Doesn't Want Nilbog Ice Cream' underpin the urgency of the protagonists quest, whilst other sections such as 'Stonehenge Magic Stone' and 'Arnold Chases the Girl' carry a subdued, attenuated timbre which strips away the pretentiousness of the ego and leaves one at the mercy of his own infallibility.

In summation, Troll 2 is perhaps the most important film of the 20th Century, a landmark in modern cinematic history and a magnum opus in storytelling.",1334707200,3,1473,5.251063829787234

1887941,1,B00009PY4I,"Sorry, Michael Stephenson. I can see why you want to commemorate ""Troll 2,"" the film on which you wasted your childhood, as ""The Best Worst Movie"" ever made. And I'd be a liar if I didn't admit you have thousands of fans who agree with you. But, in my opinion, ""Troll 2"" is the ultimate laff riot only for ""Fangoria""-reading fans of ooey-gooey creature features. On the other hand, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" the enduring masterpiece of the incomparable Edward D. Wood Jr., is a wonderfully hilarious treat for anyone who has ever seen a movie, or even heard of movies.

I admit ""Troll 2"" has the Best Worst Performance ever recorded on film, with Deborah Reed's snarling, smirking, twisting interpretation of Creedence Leonore Gielgud, leader of the goblins. (I only hope the real Gielgud never learned of his cinematic namesake.) And it may well have the Best Worst Plot Twist ever, when you, portraying little Joshua Waits, foil the baddies by pulling a double-decker bologna sandwich out of your backpack. (The baloney in the sandwich matches the baloney in the script.) But in the battle between ""Plan 9's"" kookiness and ""Troll 2's"" ookiness, for me the kookiness wins every time.

Nevertheless, Michael, I must also admit that the sheer, breathtaking lunkheadedness of ""Troll 2"" kept me glued to the screen, whereas its predecessor, ""Troll,"" had me reaching for the ""Off"" button exactly 13 minutes and 7 seconds into the film. There was a certain amount of pleasure at the beginning to watch the confab of Ben Stone, Tiffany Welles, Elaine Benes, Andy Travis, Boxey, Timmy's mom and the ineffable Sonny Bono, but after a couple of minutes all the cliched dialogue, shouted at the tops of the lungs of every member of the A-list cast, became unbearable. So if ""Troll 2"" is not the Best Worst Movie, it is the Better Worst Movie, or at least the More Entertaining Worst Movie, of the two movies with ""Troll"" in their titles.",1286323200,2,1928,4.804216867469879
1887942,5,B00009PY4I,"Troll 2, like Halloween 3, is a sequel that has nothing in common with the original but the title. In this case, the title was apparently added to capitalize on the ""success"" of Troll V 1.0.
  While the original Troll is a surreal, twisted, good/bad sui generis quasi-masterwork of quirk, this one, which, again, bears no relation to the first film, is one of the most monumental train wrecks ever filmed.
  After a really baffling prologue involving a Peter Pan lookalike, a bowl of green goo and a girl whose freckles were dotted on with a Sharpie Marker, the story shifts to a family of four. They consist of an actor who resembles Sam Waterston; his wife, who seems a little crazy; his daughter, Holly, a garden-variety 80's-style bimbo; and his son Joshua, who has regular conversations with the ghost of his grandfather, the poor man's Wilford Brimley. Holly's apparently gay boyfriend and his ambiguously gay friends (whose first act in the movie is to admire Holly's curtains; later they sleep together, semi-naked) are also along for the ride.
  The movie doesn't waste any time diving right in to the ridiculous; the family goes on some kind of nonsensical ""vacation"" which consists of them exchanging houses (?!) with a family of complete strangers from the remote town of ""Nilbog"" (that, oddly enough, ain't ""Troll"" spelled backwards). If that premise isn't unbelievable enough for you, don't you worry, there's plenty more insanity to come, as the family eventually learns that the town is populated by goblins (not Trolls, mind you), who first feed people neon-colored cakes and cookies that somehow turn them in to vegetable matter, and then eat them. That's if they're lucky. Others less fortunate get turned into a tree, while their b***s get turned into a milkshake. Probably the best scene in the movie, by the way.
  A few choice moments:
  The family arrives at their exchange house to find a table full of the aforementioned garishly-colored cakes and pastries, which they don't hesitate to sit down to eat, not thinking for a minute, ""hey, this is f***** up"". Thanks to the longest 30 seconds in recorded history, Josh is able to rescue his family by relieving himself on the sweets! For his troubles, his ungrateful father chides him with the best line in the movie: ""You can't p*** on hospitality!""
  One of Holly's BF's buds sees a frightened girl running in the woods. He does what any normal guy would do, he tackles her at a full run. He then takes her to a Satanic-looking church, where Creedence (yes, that's her name), played by a woman who seems to have just strayed in from a porn film or maybe the fringes of performance art, changes the girl into mush to be eaten, and the guy into a tree, also to be eaten. We know this, because the guy helpfully tells us: ""They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!""
  Joshua's Grandpa tells Joshua, during one of their meetings, ""Your mother has never taken my advice. That's why she married that good-for-nothing."" (You know, your g*dd*mn father.) Later on, he pops up to helpfully hand Josh a Molotov Cocktail! Apparently Gramps served a few years in the SDS!
  Holly finally delivers the ultimatum to her boyfriend for him to decide between her or his friends. She expresses this by clocking him with a stunning right cross to the jaw! This is after the scene in which she knees him in the crotch. Interesting relationship they've got going there!
  Not at all surprisingly, this one ends with one of those eye-rolling, predictable, ""shock"" endings that were de riguer in the 80's/90's, and one loaded with glaring continuity errors! Might as well go out with a bang!",1285459200,2,3683,4.800632911392405

1887967,5,B00009PY4I,"I've seen this movie dozens of times now - and I think it just keeps getting funnier.

Can we start off with the most ridiculous, basic flaw?  The movie is called TROLL 2. It has absolutely nothing to do with the first movie, Troll, and its about Goblins!! Were they just trying to ride the coattails of the first movie? According to IMDB, Troll made a mere $5.4M, so that seems like a dubious choice.  And you have to love, 2/3 through the movie, when the main character finally makes the realization everyone else did after 2 minutes...""Nilbog is Goblin backwards! This is their kingdom!!!"" In fact, all of their sudden realizations are great, like the character Arnold - ""Wait...they're eating her! And they're going to eat me! OH my GOOOOOD!!""

I didn't think it was possible for a movie to be so hilariously bad, but this one is. The acting is beyond horrific. I have a hard time decided who the worst actor is, but I lean towards the mother. And if the acting wasn't bad enough, the script writing is worse! Like when Grandpa Seth accidentally appears in the wrong mirror in the house, Joshua scolds him for his mistake, to which he replies ""I'm sorry, I haven't learned the layout of this house.""  How does that sequence get added? And what's with the popcorn scene in the trailer? THAT is how you know something is truly horrible - the actor is laughing as he tries to sputter ""too...much....popcorn!"" It reminds me of Jimmy Fallon all over again, except with a movie where you can always do another take.

The lack of any sort of special effects only adds to the experience - such as in the scene where Grandpa Seth freezes everyone but Joshua - but you can still see them moving and their drinks sloshing. Or when a trol...er...goblin throws a spear at a guy, it has to cut away to a scene of the spear flying high in the air (they were only 10 yards apart), only to cut back to him getting hit, in an entirely different setting from where he was before. And the Goblin outfits themselves....epic!

Also, I'm fairly certain the director added a subtext of the daughter's boyfriend struggling with homosexuality. There is an inexplicable bond between him and his buddies, Holly makes reference to it not being hard to turn him homo, there's the quick cutaway in the trailer of the guys laying together in a bed, among others. I tell ya - this director is genius!

I would give anything to spend 10 minutes talking to the masterminds behind this movie. It boggles my mind that a rational mind could actually create this masterpiece - but it was done.

I went looking for the movie and found that there was a ""two fer"" of Troll One and Two on DVD.  I had to have it!  The original Troll movie is great - schticky, halfway decent acting, a decent story line, cheesy special effects, typical 80's movie.  Troll 2 on the other hand is the absolute worst movie that I've ever seen.  I've seen A LOT of movies, and I truly mean that Troll 2 was the worst piece of garbage ever to be put to DVD.  The acting was absolutely horrible (I know, that's how it's supposed to be), the storyline was weaker than a glass house, and the ""special effects"" look like they were designed and constructed by someone ""special"" if you catch my drift.  It pained me to watch that movie.  I understand that the whole purpose of a ""cult classic"" movie is to be so terrible that it's good.  Troll 2 takes this to a whole different level.  In most cult classics, theres an attempt at a storyline, half hearted acting, and some hope that the movie will be make it to the box office, but only ends up being loved by a select group of people.  Troll 2 makes no attempt to be semi decent.  It's absolutely awful.  I feel like I've lost IQ points from watching it.

I was all keyed up to see what a lot of Amazon reviewers were describing as possibly the worst movie of all time, ""Troll 2""... Big disappointment. It's not THAT bad. Typical 2 star B-movie. I'd compare it to any of the lousier entries in the Puppet Master series in terms of quality. I guess the movie's main faults, and they're pretty common faults in B-movies, are that there is too much information given in dialogue about the plot, the acting is sub-par, and the movie drags after a certain point. Nothing to get worked up about. I've been working with Youtube director Frank Stamm recently and, after having had some experience now in film/video production, I can actually say a few POSITIVE things about ""Troll 2"": the camerawork is fairly good, and some care was put into the script -- even if some of the dialogue is a little Saturday-morning-TV-hokey. The movie's biggest fault probably comes from the fact that the actors seem amateur-level. If they'd been better actors, they could have made the dialogue sound more believable.",1248998400,3,1061,4.766304347826087

1887982,5,B00009PY4I,"Once upon a time, I fancied that I knew a little something about bad movies.

Well, in fact I was getting rather vain about it. I turned up my nose at people who think ""Showgirls"" or ""Gigli"" are great anti-movies, when in fact they are only about 15 percent worse than the usual Hollywood dreck. Almost as bad were those who took the well-trod path of ""Plan 9"" or ""Hitler's Brain"", which, while quite deliciously bad in spots, are, in the final analysis, little more than amateurish relics of a bygone era.

No, while those flicks are, in their own way, modestly amusing, they were not for me: my palate was more refined; my bad taste was just a bit better than that of the common herd. I was quite the anti-connoisseur (or so I thought). My preference was for the finely aged Italian imitation cheese of the seventies and eighties. Movies such as ""The New Barbarians"" and ""Star Crash"" topped my list, although I could also dip my beak with pleasure into such anti-musical masterpieces as ""The Apple"" or ""Can't Stop the Music"" on occasion, or enjoy the modern anti-comedy stylings of a Tom Green in ""Freddy Got Fingered"", or even the classic anti-blockbuster ""Battlefield Earth"".

I was a fool. Until I saw ""Troll 2"", I knew nothing at all about what a bad movie could truly be.

All my former preconceptions: gone. All of what I took to be my knowledge: vanished without a trace.

I know that my view of film has changed forever. And I still don't know how to deal with it. For now, I have walled off ""Troll 2"" in a special part of my mind. This movie simply does not seem possible; it just does not compute. I place it as an anamoly, as a ""special case"", so that I can continue to live in my own little world, continue to have my own little list of favorites, my own little pet theories about what makes a great anti-movie.

But some day, I will have to look this green-blooded, rubbery goblin mask square in its face, and deal with what ""Troll 2"" has done to me, has done to us all.

I managed to finish it a few months later and I must say the plot had some serious twists and the parts that were meant to be funny sometimes did make me chuckle, a painful I can't believe they just did that chuckle but a chuckle nonetheless.  It is amazing what they do with corn in this movie.  It did however deliver what my brother was looking for by being an all around failure.

Young Joshua and his extremely stupid family decide to take a vacation, but instead of venturing off to some candy-coated theme park, they've decided to switch houses with a redneck family in a small town called Nilbog. There they plan to live life like ""peasants and farmers."" But it doesn't take long before things get real ugly.

Guided by the ghostly visage of his Grandpa Seth, Joshua begins to suspect that the people of Nilbog aren't exactly what they seem. (Of course, he's right - after all, it doesn't take a genius to realize that 'Nilbog' is 'Goblin' spelled backwards). Using icky green food to poison their victims, these vengeful `vegetarians' (don't ask!) devour any poor soul who happens into their sleepy little village. But when they turn their murderous intentions on Joshua's unsuspecting family, they get more than they bargained for. Armed with Molotov cocktails, baloney sandwiches, and a full bladder (please don't ask!), this whiny little prat locks horns with an ultra-low budget army of goblins and their witchy queen. But can Josh and his ghostly Grandpa save the family before it's too late?

The first Troll, a piece of 80's cheese starring the likes of Sonny Bono, June Lockhart, Julia Louis Dreyfus and camp film icon Michael Moriarty, was by no means a cinematic watershed, but its sequel(?!) has absolutely nothing in common with it. (There aren't even any trolls!) What Troll 2 does have (in spades) is comedy -- outlandish, outrageous, un-intentional comedy.

It could quite possibly be the best-worst movie ever made!

The highlight of the film is a mind-blowing twist about an hour in that is probably the most shocking revelation in cinematic history. (Not really, but one that will assuredly boggle your brain and loosen your bowels.)  When the secret of Nilbog is revealed, you'll slap yourself repeatedly in disbelief while groaning painfully.

1887999,4,B00009PY4I,"Torok the Troll King wants to dominate the world and bring his dark kingdom forth by starting at an apartment where a former Witch bride turned nemesis, now resides. With his Magical ring, he takes the form of a little girl named Wendy Potter, who just came to live there with her family, and was placed into suspended animation. He thereby goes about causing mischief among the residents of the rooms:

There's swinging playboy with the likely name of ""Peter Dickinson"" {played by Sonny Bono}, a fanatical Vet, diminuative Professor Malcolm Mallory {who gets a second chance at life, thanks to Torok}, a college student couple, and of course, Harry Potter Jr. and Sr. {much before J.K. Rowling's series, perhaps whence she lifted the name}. One by one, they are each engulfed into a pod which transforms them into various trolls.

Eunice St. Clair the Witch {Ann & June Lockheart} regails young Harry Potter with her troll tales, accompanied by a phallic mushroom creature she keeps in a planter, disguised as a lamp. By far the most elegant and secretive of the group, she grows young, and it is up to her to counter Torok's efforts, but is instead turned into a talking tree stump.

Particularly enjoyable scenes include the singing chorus of trolls likened Ghoulies, a seductive frolicking nymph, the transformations, Torok's smile of diabolical satisfaction, and the final confrontation with an impressive demonic troll giant.

Now, I am actually a fan of bad movies.  I like them.  For me, there is a certain kind of charm in movies where you can see the boom mike, or where there are more plot-holes than a barrel of Swiss cheese.  But every now and then, there comes along something that is so grievous, so utterly unwatchable that it causes me intense emotional distress and sometimes actual physical pain and/or uncontrollable vomiting.  Such is the case with Troll 2.  I went into this half expecting something related to the first movie, ""Troll"" which is actually watchable.  Not so.  First, Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls.  Not only are there no trolls in this film, but no one even mentions the word ""troll"" at all.  Instead, we see glances of the film's protagonists, a lot of dwarves with badly formed latex masks (called ""goblins"" in the ""film"") and a hideous, frightening terrible out-of-work community theater refugee that's supposed to be their mother of sorts.  I say hideous, because at one point she takes off her ""witch"" makeup and transforms into what is supposed to be an alluring vixen in an attempt to seduce an underage teenager - that's when the term hideous applies.  The special effects, if they can be called that, are cast-offs from garage projects of local sci-fi fans and junior high school prop rooms.  The acting is, across the board, the worst I have ever suffered through.  It's obvious no one knew their lines, and were just a step away from reading cue cards.  In fact, there were a few instances where they did just this.  Words like ""stilted"" and ""wooden"" and ""amateurish"" would be kind descriptions indeed.

But I've teased you long enough.  You want to know what the plot was, right?  Well, dammit!  So do I!  There wasn't one.  The closest I could ascertain was this:  A kid starts having hallucinations about his dead grandfather, who comes to his bedroom each night to read him gory tales of medieval people whose scalps explode when nasty goblins (who actually disguise themselves as beautiful women with painted-on freckles) trick them into eating tainted ice cream, which turns them into plants.  So the goblins can eat them - the people.  Because they (the goblins) are vegetarians.  Anyway, the boy's parents plan a sort of ""Trading Spouses"" trip to a small town called Nilbog (goblin spelled backwards - point beaten about our face and neck several times throughout the film)  Upon reaching said Nilbog, the boy discovers that the town is really the kingdom of the goblins in human guise.  In the meantime, his older sister who is dying to lose her virginity has manipulated her boyfriend to follow them to the town in a Winnebago.  Then it gets confusing.  One of boys meets a hot chick running through the woods, being chased by goblins.  They run to a church inhabited by a witch.  Witch turns girl and boy into plants - goblins eat girl - save boy for later.  His pals never miss him.  At this point, we are introduced to some side plot involving spoiled milk that I never understood.  Another teen runs to the grocery store - all they have is spoiled milk for sale.  He gets some, and stumbles upon the church - sees his friend standing in a flowerpot.  Witch returns, kills flower pot boy with a chainsaw and kills spoiled milk boy as well.

Meanwhile, the family has run out of food - they go into town to buy groceries and get the same spoiled milk shtick.  Upon returning home, all of the goblin people have showed up and they have a hoedown with lots of food.  In the meantime, the young boy who sees his dead grandfather is captured and the attempt to force feed him the goblin ice cream, but he's save in the nick of time.  Back at the house, the boy friend and the rest of the family enjoy the musical stylings of the goblin-people square dance quartet while the dead grandpa breaks out of a mirror and scares the whore-sister.  They have a long fight with the goblin people.  The witch returns to the last teen watching a movie in the Winnebago.  Oh, how I longed to be watching whatever that was on the TV in the camper, which happened to be a movie about a chimp in a tutu that could fly with sparks flying out of the tutu.  Anyway, the witch comes, now as what we are supposed to interpret as a sexy seductress. brandishing an ear of corn that she intends to use to entice her last young victim.  To do what, we can only guess.  They make out and the ear of corn turns to popcorn, engulfing the lad and frightening away the witch. Got is so far?

In the epic final battle, the goblins and witch are defeated when dead grandpa and the rest of the family put their hands on the rocks of Stonehenge, which happens to be in the witch's house.  All is well.  Not quite.  The goblins show up again at their real home, change the mother into plant matter, eat her and offer some to the boy.  Neat huh?  No!  It's an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.  I could have been unclogging the toilet or cleaning the gutters or some other interesting chore.

The dialogue and the way it is read by the actors has to be seen to believed. It's as if the cast is made up of space aliens who have an entirely different acting and storytelling style than normal humans.

The director (Claudio Fragasso, or Drake Floyd as he goes by in the credits) reportedly hardly spoke a word of English, and his only real directions were ""more"" and ""a lot more"". Here is but a sampling of the great, Shakespearean screenplay:

*""They're eating her! (pause) And then they're going to eat ME! (pause) OH MY GAWWWWWWWWWDDDDD!
*""I'm Sheriff Gene Freak.""
*""[I am] tightening my belt one loop so that I don't feel hunger pains, and your sister and mother will have to do likewise.""
*""Nilbog! It's goblin spelled backwards! This is their kingdom!""

The acting, special effects (if that's what you want to call them) and the dialogue are just horrendous. My friends all love this movie, they each own a copy. They had been trying to talk me into giving this movie a shot but I had been hesitant. Finally, I broke down and watched it when I had a really bad case of stomach flu. This movie made me laugh so hard I ended up watching it three times in the course of one week. My mom thought it was hilarious. I now find myself wanting to share the glory of this awful movie with everyone I encounter.

I understand where some of these other reviewer's opinions are stemming from and I respect that. If you have never seen Troll 2 and are expecting a semi-decent horror flick, you will be sorely dissapointed. Yet, if you go into it knowing ahead of time that it is really campy (and very obviously tongue-in-cheek) then I think it will exceed your expectations. I believe that this movie can only be truely appreciated by those people who are willing to take it for what it is, not what they had hoped it would be.

On that note, I will leave you with my favorite (and most recognizable) quote: ""Do you want some Josh-oo-wah?""",1151712000,4,1254,4.3319148936170215
1888018,2,B00009PY4I,"I think enough has been said about Troll 2 in the other reviews, but not enough about the first Troll. I saw it when I was 12 and thought it was hilarious and full of weird creatures. Well watching it again with the family 19 years later was pretty tedious.

The plot is rather thin and consists of the fairy world trying to take over this world. This begins by a Troll changing an apartment building one room at a time into a sort of portal. He does this under the guise of a girl he kidnapped at the beginning of the movie. Apparently he was living in the basement of the apartment building since it was built and finally an unescourted blond girl happened down there so he could begin his evil deeds.

I imagine the troll would have had his work cut out for him considering he was the only one with a magic ring. The other goblins that came over would just sit around in the various apartments looking damp and probably wondering how long this would take. I kept wondering WHY they wanted to take over this world. Their's seemed lush and green and wide open. Why do they want to take over a world with pollution and overcrowding? In addition, there's a 400 year old guardian witch living in the building and plenty of plot devices and loopholes to keep you from questioning everything that happens.

I also think it's necessary to mention the not-so-special effects. While it goes without saying that an 80s scary b-movie isn't going to have any amazing effects, by today's standards they really take you out of the movie. My 10 year old daughter (spoiled by Harry Potter and Jurassic Park) lost interest and didn't make it to the end. My wife rolled her eyes and grunted in plenty of scenes.

i mean the part where joshua screams out ""your a genius big sister"" nearly made me fall out of my chair laughing

the movie takes place in a small town where EVERYONE is a vegan

and like the religous people there have a phobia towards those who eat meat and they are ""unpure"" if they eat it which ironically saves johusa in the movie by eating a double decker sandwich with meat

the goblins in this movie ARE creepy esspeically the one with the bolding eyes EEK!

anyway thoughout the flim joshua is looking at pictures of CREEPY looking trolls which is ironic considering it's golibins

anyway in the movie the only way for the golibins to eat is for someone to eat something so they could eat them!

i'm not a child but that still is a scary thought!

after watching this movie i didn't look at green and red the same way again nor could i eat much

Ok, so I bought this double feature DVD for the sole purpose of finally ridding myself of the crappy VHS copy of Troll (1) standing in my shelf beside all the other DVDs. I was surprised that there actually was a sequel to this movie, which, in my book is an 80s classic. Little did I know the horrible truth that was about to unravel before me on the screen. For Troll 2 has to be, THE crappiest movie AND the crappiest sequel EVER made! I don't even know where to start explaining, so that you good people who read this will realize the Supreme suck factor of Troll 2.
All the usual clichees like ""low budget"" and ""bad acting"" simply don't suffice! Low budget, for one, is not even synonymous to bad movies. Troll 2 is almost beyond MST3K material. I don't know how else to explain it. Instead I can only ramble on. It's almost like you SHOULD watch this movie if not only for the purpose of study. A study of the precision with which they have managed avoid everything...ANYTHING that makes a good movie. My only comfort is that Troll 2 doesn't relate to the original Troll in any way. Another thing that saves this DVD is that it's cheap, and Troll (1) is actually worth the price. I just wish that Troll 1 would be available on a DVD of its own.

1888024,3,B00009PY4I,"My sentiments to this double feature are pretty similar to many of the other Amazon reviewers, particularly in regard to TROLL 2, certainly one of the worst movies ever made.  Let's go in order, though:  TROLL was one of those movies that fell into the market courtesy of such movies as GREMLINS and GHOULIES.  Set in an apartment house, the story focuses on a nasty troll planning to set up his ""universe"" in the apartment house and then once that was done, explode into the whole world and taking it over.  The troll immediately takes the place of little Wendy, turning her into a bratty, insubordinate little pain in the butt.  Only her brother suspects something is amiss.  TROLL tries to be a comedy first and then a horror; it doesn't truly succeed as either.  Suffice to say, the elegant June Lockhart and her daughter Anne add some class; we get cameos from Sonny Bono, a young Julia Louis Dreyfus, Gary Sandy and Brad Hall.  Michael Moriarty and Shelley Hack play the parents, and Noah Hathaway (Never Ending Story) is the hero Harry Potter, Jr.  Isn't it kind of ironic that Harry Potter was used as character names in this 1985 film, long before our current teenage hero.  TROLL 2 has nothing to do with the first film; in fact, the word troll is never used (guess LLORT wouldn't have been a good name for the town?).  Anyway, they're called goblins, and there is such bad acting, horrible makeup and special effects and no chill factor whatsoever.  Deborah Reed who plays the Queen is so unabashedly cartoonish, you can't help but howl at her every line.  Joshua, Holly and their parents are equally as bad.  Yes, I did laugh a lot during TROLL 2 so as a comedy it worked rather well, but one cannot deny the lack of any quality in this corker.  So if you're looking for a good laugh and to see one of the most reviled movies in cinema history, then take a troll with these two!",1108857600,4,1890,4.5014662756598245
1888025,5,B00009PY4I,"Now.... How could one begin to describe Troll 2? I could never even try to begin to do this film justice in mere text with a cast blatantly on day release from a psychiatric institution and special effects courtesy of BLUE Peter.

I come from Stratford, and when a terrible tourist shop shut down because of the rubbish it sold- i felt it was necessary to pay it a visit. Amoungst the remaining tat which hadn't been sold from the shop which was appropriatly called 'Insanity', I had the life-changing moment, an epiphany when i read the back of 'TROLL 2'. One really wasn't enough.

If you want gore, tack, lust, and sex with vegetables, this beast of cinematic experience is for you. A MUST for all cinema fans. The horrors are so infinate in number that they cannot all be listed, but for your pleasure i will outline some reccurent themes:

Incest

Cannibalism

The evil of vegetarianism

Appauling acting

The worst special effects EVER (no really, blind lepers could have done better!) a good one is the green water that pours down their faces when they're being 'transformed' and the foliage which appears to be stuck on them with glue.

Teenage sex

Drug abuse (other than that of the director)

The WORST soundtrack in history (The opening scene consists of the trolls frolicking in the woods to bad eighties electro-pop)

'Trolls', (throughout the film, the word 'Troll' isn't used once, they are referred to as goblins) which look like dwarfs with faces like smacked arses wearing potato sacks stuffed with lumpy pillows. Their masks are gems too- in one riveting scene, you get a close up of its mouth showing it had a tongue and it was clearly a man wearing a plaster fo paris mask.

a 'popcorn' sex scene and so so so so so much more.

Well, ""Troll 2"" indeed achieves this objective of shedding light onto the human character. No, not because the movie is any good, but because when you watch it (presumably alongside two or three of your friends who were too bored to protest when you suggested putting ""Troll 2"" in), you will realize how much you've missed human interaction in your lifelong quest of finding a good movie to watch. ""Troll 2"" won't play with you this way; right offhand, you'll know that it's going to be terrible. But is this really a bad thing? Remember those friends of yours? Even the most unflappable of companions you have should, you'll find, start protesting about twenty minutes into this film, dropping little comments like ""are you kidding me?"" and ""oh my GOD..."" under their breath between humorless, disbelieving giggles. By fifty minutes, you and your brethren will all be Mystery Science Theater 3000-ing the bejeezus out of the finely crafted piece of cinematic [...] that is ""Troll 2"".

It is the motion picture at its finest; it brings people closer to the ones they love.

A word of warning, though... Watch ""Troll 2"" alone, and you run the serious risk of getting a headache; a dull, numbing sensation on all of the parts of your brain that do thinking when they're not watching ""Troll 2"".

Oh, what I also would give to hear a commentary track by the director and cast!  Their brains should be put in glass jars and displayed in a medical museum somewhere upon their deaths!  This is one for the ages.  If you haven't seen it, remember the way RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK starts off on a high of adventure with that cave escape and then keeps trying to top it?  Well, TROLL 2 starts out atop the Mt. Everest of stupidity and then miraculously keeps upping the stakes.  It's the zenith of moron creativity!  When you're holding your sides for the tenth time from laughing and think to yourself the ""actors"" can't possibly deliver another so-called line of dialogue in a way that's any more disjointedly absurd yet painfully sincere to top the last one, THEY DO IT!  Talk about alternative reality!  The CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI looks like an episode of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW next to this.  Just a small sampling of my favorite high points:

Grandpa Seth's unintentional and uncanny ability to sound - whenever he tries to pass on an eerie warning to his grandson - like a pervert!
Teenage Holly's scary-hip dance moves (for wooden acting she makes Brooke Shields in THE BLUE LAGOON look like a piker)!
The classic early conversation between the father and mother in which they discuss why and how they are trading houses with a strange farm family they don't know (David Mamet, eat your heart out)!
The subtle subtext choice of the actress playing the mother to choose to read all her lines with a ""damnit-I-forgot-to-take-my-anti-depressant-medication-again-today"" delivery.
The wacky pack of Holly's boyfriend and his friends - all of whom seem to have the brains of emotionally immature six-year-olds transplanted into their sixteen-year-old bodies (be sure to look for the hilarious sharing-the-same-bed quick cut-away shot too)!
The family's ingeniously logical plan to starve themselves for days on end to punish young Joshua for peeing on their dinner in order to save their lives (don't ask)!
The line that's right up there with ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn"" and ""Louie, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship"" . . . ""You're a genius, big sister!""

As another reviewer said, a thousand reviews can't begin to scratch the surface as to how side-splittingly bad this movie is.

1888032,5,B00009PY4I,"Something indefinable has moved me to write this review. I don't understand and can't explain what this movie has done and is still doing to me. Words cannot convey this sense of foreboding I feel in the pit of my stomach. I guess I should give you some background as to what I'm rambling about. I purchased Troll/Troll 2 for the sole purpose of owning Troll 1. I had no idea what Troll 2 was or what it would eventually do to me. You see, I had seen Troll 1 when I was around 5-7 years old and had relatively fond memories of it, so when I saw the DVD for sale I snatched it up. The strangest sensation overtook me then. A cross between nervousness and uneasy trepidation, which for those that don't know, feels like knots and razors in your stomach while your skin breaks into a cold sweat. The feeling soon passed and I quickly forgot about it. Later that day I watched Troll 1 expecting to relive a bit of my childhood. Well, the saying ""you can never go home"" held true for me. I found Troll 1 to be an unforgettably, forgettable movie if that makes any sense, completely disposable and not worth mentioning beyond this point. I watched Troll 2 the next day. My expectations were low, but I figured I might as well give the second movie a chance. My life would be infinitely better had I washed my hands of the whole affair and turned my attention towards other pursuits, or maybe not. Who's to say? Where would the world be if there had been no Bubonic Plague or if the members of the Beatles had never formed a band? My soul cries out for a ""what could have been"" but without the Bubonic plague mightn't the world be burdened by overpopulation and pollution? Would we have been able produce someone whose intellect would dwarf Einstein's? If the Beatles had never formed would some other band have been able to garner the recognition they deserved in the void left by the Beatles or would they create what in hindsight would be considered puerile drivel? These are pointless questions that can never be answered. Time to get down to brass tacks. I cannot stop watching Troll 2. I have alienated friends and family members. I have become an outcast in my neighborhood and have been shunned by co-workers. What is worse, as each day passes I find it harder to disassociate myself from this film. My waking thoughts are centered around it. My being has become enmeshed with its life force, and make no mistake it is alive. It grows stronger with each viewing. There is no turning back. I have gotten to the point where I feel little remorse showing this film to others, addicting them, changing them, tailoring them, so that they may spread the Gospel that is Troll 2. I'm slowly coming to the realization that this is not just weird gibberish that I'm spouting off, it's not cathartic, and it does not ease my burden or put the last shreds of my guilty conscience to rest. Yes...yes. I have become drunk off the wine of revelation and I understand now, I finally see. I do not fear the outcome. I feel the re-assuring hand on my shoulder.

1888033,4,B00009PY4I,"Unless you saw this movie as a small and fragile minded child, you probably won't like it at all. I won't describe the effect this movie has had on me, but I will say that Troll 2 is the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. It has absolutely nothing to do with the first one. It shouldn't even be called a sequel. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking, if there even WAS one. Upon watching it I found myself actually feeling inferior to any form of life anywhere. By the end of Troll 2 I was the only person left in the room. However, I am a big fan of the first one. The only reason I rated this DVD 4 stars is because it includes the ""sequel"". Had it been just Troll, it would have gotten all my 5 stars. All this has probably been said already, but I didn't have time to review all 26 reviews ...
So if you like 80's-Style horror movies, and you like fantasy (because this is mostly a fantasy movie) then you may like it. I will say that the soundtrack is what made the first movie, (composed and conducted by Richard Band, the director (of the first movie's) brother?) The musical score was essential to the movie, because it gives you that creepy, suspenseful eerie enchanted feeling that the story does convey, but the acting gets in the way of. The musical score on the 2nd movie, though, is like a train wreck. It's 90's style power, neon-flourescent psuedo techno crap. If you end up purchasing this product, you may as well scribble (hard) the word ""Troll"" on one side, as it will hopefully scratch off the data of the sequel, but at the same time keep the first movie's data readable, because that's the only one worth watching.
Conclusion: This movie may not be for everyone, the ""sequel"" sucked phenomenally, the musical score in the first one was great, and it's a good story, keep in mind, but the acting might ruin it for some people.",1086825600,4,1873,4.339031339031339

It may be considered a ""bad"" movie by most,but it's a funny bad and can't be missed if you want to just see idiocy onscreen. As a child I actually enjoyed it, now as an adult I just amuse myself by how laughably silly the movie is. A strange inclusion of Sonny Bono in his apartment getting attacked by a Troll is priceless entertainment. There is actually some decent acting, but most is the epitomy of bad, so dont' expect any academy awards for anything. Overall, it's silly watchable stupidity. Kids will love it.

1888035,5,B00009PY4I,"I bought this particular DVD for TROLL 2, and you should too...as soon as possible.  It's so bad...yet so amazingly great.  Every movie watched on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 pales in comparison to Troll 2.  I assume that the MST3K crew decided to simply stay away from this one...it was just too much.  Instead, they chose Hobgoblins.
ANYWAYS, you must believe the hype.  The acting goes from 2 extremes: no acting and over-acting.  Diana, the mother, is great at not-acting.  Every line she delivers is hilarious.  Every look on her face is hilarious.  Plus, she looks like a troll.  Michael, the father, is incoherent at best, what with his partial southern accent that makes words like ""breakfast"" sound like a retarded mess.  Michael is responsible for some great lines in the movie.  Holly, the daughter, fits in with the rest of her stupid family...except she's got some AWESOME dance moves!  She seems like she just stepped off of the stage of a high school play.  And then there's Joshua, the son and the hero.  Everything he says is whiny and he always seems like he's in pain.  He looks like he hasn't fully developed from a fetus yet.  Try watching him whine and yell in slow-motion...his face is amazing.  Especially when he delivers his classic line ""You're a genius, big sister!""
In additon, Troll 2 features the ghost of Joshua's Grandpa Seth...a very creepy old man indeed.  Grandpa Seth has various magical powers, too.  Let's just say that he can manipulate the fabric of time.  And then there's Holly's boyfriend, and Holly's boyfriend's boyfriends.  This group of 4 color-coded funboys really adds nothing to the movie's pseudo-plot at all.  Just unintentional laughs.
Let's not forget about the trolls...oops, I mean GOBLINS, in Troll 2.  There are no trolls in Troll 2!  What was I thinking!  This fact alone should make you instantly purchase this movie.
I would discuss what the movie is about, but it's not really about anything.  There's a town called Nilbog (isn't there something odd about that name?).  There's a lot of hillbilly townfolk.  There's disgusting food products like milk and green pudding-type stuff.  There's midgets in burlap sacks with pointy sticks.  There's even a Stonehenge magical stone!  But there's no apparent plot.  Don't let that fool you...the various pieces of cinematic excrement are far more entertaining than anything else you're likely to see in your life!

I hope they realese these films sepret, so all the people who hate the second and arn't buying this will be happy.  I bought this cause I love Troll.  So, I really hate to say this but, buy at your own risk or do what I do, pretend that Troll 2 isn't even on that same disk.",1079654400,,937,4.032608695652174
1888050,4,B00009PY4I,"This cinematic duo makes for great entertainment for different reasons. ""Troll"", made in 1986, is a story of troll infestation in an urban apartment building revolving around a family who has just moved in. This is a fun, yet campy, little movie with a couple of surprises that, while not totally unexpected, are still generally well done. The supporting cast in this film is wonderful, with special mentions going to Sonny Bono playing a hip swinging single (he has wonderful dialogue), Julia Louis-Dreyfus in an early role, and Gary Sandy (Andy Travis from ""WKRP"") as an amusing former Marine. The film is a typical mid-eighties PG-13 shocker, with no real gore, but a little excess grossness. Overall, for its genre, a good flick and fun to watch.
The real treasure of the DVD, though, is, by far, ""Troll 2"", which actually does not involve trolls, but goblins. This movie is easily the worst sequel in memory. It has an awful, incoherent script, completely moronic `plot', terrible acting, and characters actually made of cliches. This film is a treasure, and is like watching the modern invocation of Ed Wood, the muse of bad movies. Special bonus points for the secret weapon employed against the goblins! Bad movie lovers do not miss this one!
Four stars overall: ""Troll"" gets three stars for being an average scary movie; ""Troll 2"" easily earns five stars for incredible stupidity on every level. Don't miss it!",1076544000,45,1419,4.916666666666667
1888051,5,B00009PY4I,"This DVD is one of those double feature presentations that studios use to bundle together a couple of clunkers in order to make a fast buck. ""Troll"" is the story of the Potter family and the wacky adventures they experience when they move into a new apartment building. Harry Potter and his wife Anne (played by a spacey Michael Moriarty and Shelley Hack, respectively), along with their two children Wendy and Harry soon discover an odd assortment of characters living in the building, including Sonny Bono as a wild swinger with an extreme dislike for children, Gary Sandy (Andy Travis from ""WKRP""!) as a macho ex-marine with a suspicion for book lovers and liberals, and June Lockhart as a mysterious lady living on the top floor of the building. Brad Hall and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, recovering from their disastrous stint on ""Saturday Night Live,"" turn up as a smoochy young couple. It isn't too long before Wendy Potter discovers a troll in the basement of the apartment building, and from that point forward ""Troll"" is a wild, wacky, and enormously cheesy excursion into fantasyland. It turns out that the troll is trying to recreate a fairy dimension within the confines of the building in order to start a war against humanity. Oh, the madcap wackiness of ""Troll""! The scenes with Julia Louis-Dreyfus frolicking with the troll should provide all the convincing you'll need to watch this objet d'art.
The real treasure on this disc is the inclusion of ""Troll 2."" I first saw this movie on video back in 1998 or 1999, and my enthusiasm for the film reached a fever pitch when I learned it would soon arrive on DVD. B movie fans should note that none other than trash director Joe D'Amato directed this tremendously terrible film. ""Troll 2"" is so bad in EVERY aspect that it ranks as the greatest ""worst"" movie ever made. People will tell you there are plenty of other films worse than this one, but believe me when I tell you that D'Amato's efforts here trump every other contender. The script, the effects, the acting, the editing; everything is so marvelously, deliriously, deliciously awful that this movie sends me into paroxysms of joy every time I watch it. Viewing ""Troll 2"" makes you doubt your very conceptions of what a bad film means: did the people who made this film deliberately set out to create a nightmare of these proportions, or was it merely accidental? We'll never know, but every minute of this movie is sheer delight for lovers of yuck cinema. Goodness, where do I start? Well, ""Troll 2"" tells the story about a family moving to the village of Nilbog where they encounter a town full of goblins (no trolls here, sorry) led by a wacky queen who wishes to turn the visitors into goblin food. That's the plot in a nutshell, and I won't spend more time on it because I really want to discuss other aspects of the film.
You haven't lived until you have seen the people playing the characters in this movie. First, the hero of the film is Joshua, performed with screeching abrasiveness by Michael Stephenson. Accompanying Joshua to Nilbog is his dull father Michael, his hilariously wacked out Mom Diana, older sister Holly, her boyfriend Elliot, and the ghost of his grandpa Seth. Folks, you just can't imagine how bad the acting is here! The Mom speaks sentences that make little sense because the emphasis of the words is completely wrong. Holly, played by Connie McFarland, deserves a special place in our hearts with her performance. That dance she does in front of the mirror! Her lines of dialogue delivered with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer! Grandpa Seth is not only a scream; he keeps flashing a sinister smile throughout the film that should creep anyone out. The townspeople of Nilbog also deserve a special mention, especially the guy playing Sheriff Gene Freak (!). His best line: ""Otherwise, we'll be forced to kill you violently!"" I'm not even going to delve into the weird relationship between Elliot and his friends, or the outrageously over the top performance of Deborah Reed as the Queen of the Goblins. A thousand reviews would fail to convey the depths of badness ""Troll 2"" plumbs. You need to see it to believe it.
The production values here are cosmically appalling. D'Amato regular Laura Gemser did the costume work for this film, and what a job she did. The goblins wear potato sacks and plastic masks that fit so loosely around the actors' heads that you can often see bare skin around the edges. In many scenes of the film, the editing is so poor that people look in the opposite direction of the person they talk to or react to things in completely unnatural ways. On one occasion, the Dad tells the family that there are no farmers on the streets of Nilbog because they are asleep for the evening, and it is broad daylight when he says it. By the way, did anyone else notice Joshua's skateboard magically reappears in his bedroom towards the end of the film? Yep, Ed Wood quality editing here, folks. Who knew we would see such an overtly atrocious picture as late as 1991?
""Troll 2"" is pure magic and truly deserving of a five star ranking. I absolutely adore MGM for releasing this on DVD with such a good transfer along with a ""Troll 2"" trailer. What this movie really needs is a commentary track with the actors who played Joshua, Holly, Diana, Michael, Elliot, and Grandpa Seth. Hearing what these guys would say about the film would be a dream come true for this B movie fan, and I would have paid double the price if such a commentary came with the DVD.",1068076800,23,5517,4.6828012358393405

Troll 2 is a fun movie, but for greatly different reasons. Troll 2 is perfect for those nights when you and your friends want to play ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" by mocking everything that went wrong with the movie. It's definitely so bad that it's good.

I'll relate a parable:

I bought a SECOND one. Diving into part two the flavor was there... for a while... THEN it downed on me that, often,
