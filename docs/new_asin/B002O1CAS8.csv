8375790,5,B002O1CAS8,"It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, but I just like movies with a bright urban feel to them. I watched it on Netflix, and half-way through, I decided to come here to purchase it. It's better to see the boroughs in something other than a gangster movie! I think the above reviewer is looking too hard for some kind of sense or deep meaning in a fun-time movie (which is how I see it.)

On the other hand, if the writers, director, or producer wanted this to be a serious Hollywood comedy, then they were badly mistaken, and the above reviewer gets a thumbs up.",1304640000,,557,4.355769230769231
8375791,1,B002O1CAS8,"You know I want to see young actors of color get film credits and have entree to Hollywood.  However, giving the film PC points doesn't save it.  This film is just flat and awful!  Message to majority guys and rainbow-flag women: the hot chick at the center of the cover is not the main character!  She's secondary, and this film is just about 4 dumb dudes.  The comedy is poorly done.  Purists will hate hearing Caucasian Americans imitate European accents.  I suppose lots of comedy centers around intelligent men being persuaded by their dumb best buddies to do dumb things.  However, it's very painful to watch here, and the whole film is based upon it.  This film is accurate about one thing: in New York, sometimes you can't tell if a group of people are Blacks and Latinos or if the whole group is Afro-Latino.  Visually, I loved seeing the shades of chocolate and peanut butter.  However, if you watch closely, it's the darker-skinned, Blacker characters who are stupider than the lighter-skinned males with the good hair.  This film may be an example of colorism.  This film has close to no redeeming features.  I'm even thinking New Yorkers themselves would pan it.  Insipid, in every way!",1274832000,,1199,4.752427184466019
