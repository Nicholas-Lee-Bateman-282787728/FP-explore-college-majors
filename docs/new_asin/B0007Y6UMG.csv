I can definitely tell the difference after using this video only a week. I diligently do the exercises at least four times a week. The key to success is consistency.

8053865,5,B0007Y6UMG,"Surgery or no surgery? That was my question. After I got the program I followed all the instructions given and slowly I could see how my skin tightened everywhere but mostly around my neck, which is where I needed it most.

Every day before I go to sleep I have done my routine for a while now, and it's pretty amazing how you feel better, you look younger, and a great glow irradiates from you, I am sold on it. Stay young with Facebuilding really makes a difference.",1226448000,4,468,4.318181818181818
8053866,5,B0007Y6UMG,"I strongly recommend Facebuilding as a way of staying young and looking better. There are a number of surgical, medical, and chemical ways of keeping your face looking good and Fernando's DVD is the most natural, healthy, and long-term beneficial way to stay young with exercises. If you have tried facelifts, chemical peels, pastes, gels, botox injections, etc., you know that all of them are short-term and unnatural. Facebuilding is the way to go. It is your own secret fountain of youth!",1207699200,8,491,5.0
8053867,1,B0007Y6UMG,"I own all the different facial exercise DVD's currently on the market.  I believe Carole Maggio's Facercise, Face Aerobics by Judith Olivia, and the Tal Reinhart program to be far superior than this poorly produced DVD.  Although those 3 programs also have their pros and cons the ""Stay Young with Facebuilding"" DVD is tedious to use at best.  You can not go to one particular exercise if you need extra work in that area like you can with all the other programs.  No, you are forced to have to sit and fast forward through the whole DVD until you get to that particular exercise.  I also believe that the actual exercises themselves are not particularly well executed.  Save your money on this one!  If you can afford it, buy all the 3 programs above and use one every day and you will be well on your way to getting the results you are looking for.  Good luck.",1207353600,26,862,4.445859872611465
