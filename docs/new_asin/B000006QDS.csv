7904891,5,B000006QDS,"The VHS tape of the Napoleonic Foot Soldiers arrived in good fashion.  Very pleased with the promptness of service and mailing and shipping.  The tape is just what I needed to show the importance of Napoleonic Foot Soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars.  The information in the tape is great, as well as the puns and humor.  The students in my history classes enjoy this tape a great deal.  Outstanding job for AMAZON on this one.  Thanks, B.L.",1268352000,,442,4.675324675324675
