8078774,5,B000AL9J5Q,"To understand Michael Collins and his difficult role in the treaty negotiation you simply must see this superbly acted movie. Collins didn't want a return to war, a war he knew full well that Ireland could not win. The Treaty is available in dvd for 20pounds at generalmichaelcollins.com. I also highly recommend Professor Michael Laffan's ten-part lecture series, The Irish Revolution, available on iTunes.",1355529600,4,407,5.375
8078775,5,B000AL9J5Q,"This is a video that is very hard to find, although it should be required viewing for anyone interested in the history of Irish independence from England and Michael Collins, the charismatic leader who brought it about.  It is essentially the story, told in abbreviated and somewhat telescoped style, of the Irish War of Independence and the treaty with Endland which ended it and brought Ireland its first taste of freedom in 700+ years.  The main part of the story centers around the parts played by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith (the founder of Sinn Fein)in negotiating the treaty with the lions of the British Empire, in particular David Lloyd George (the ""Welsh Wizard"") and Winston Churchill.  Collins, who had just led the Black and Tan War and created the intelligence network and guerrilla strategy that had driven the English to the negotiating table, is played to perfection by Brendon Gleeson (who should have been tapped to play the same role in Neil Jordan's ""Michael Collins""--no slight intended to Liam Neeson)while all the other parts are extremely well done by a wonderful cast of predominately Irish actors, with a particular nod to Ian Bannon as the crafty Lloyd George.  The depiction of the intrigues engaged in during the negotiations, the interest taken in the dashing Collins by English/Irish society hostess Hazel Lavery, the backdoor dealings on all sides and the back-stabbing done by Irish Republican president Eamon DeValera and his supporters back home in Ireland are all engrossing and eye-opening.  The transformation of Collins from an alleged ""gunman"" into a statesman is one of the most fascinating parts of the story, as is the grudging admiration with which he comes to be viewed by the much more experienced British aristocrats facing him across the bargaining table. It is the story of a history-making break in the British Empire and the combination of nobility and deceit, power and passion of the men who were responsible for it.  Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it.",1135900800,14,2031,5.029761904761905
