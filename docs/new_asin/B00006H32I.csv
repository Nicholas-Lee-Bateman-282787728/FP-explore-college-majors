7968772,4,B00006H32I,The video was cleverly done and even a bit entertaining for our presentation. The only criticism from our University students was the short-length of the skirt worn by the instructor. It made all feel uncomfortable.,1203638400,3,215,5.171428571428572
7968773,5,B00006H32I,Great movie for etiquette training for teens.  I made up a worksheet to go with it and it gets the point across w/o being stuffy.,1170892800,3,129,4.16
7968774,2,B00006H32I,"This is truly basic etiquette for the socially challenged.  The information is good and useful as far as it goes, but for the hefty price I expected more material, more situations and more demonstrations.
