4188272,1,B003SH6GKA,"The dancing and music of El Amor Brujo are a pleasure to see and hear.  However, the visual quality of the DVD is definitely inferior.  Many scenes are definitely blurred and not clear.  This was a definitely a disappointment.  Also, the DVD was completely delivered in Spanish, no subtitles.  Unless you are fluent in Spanish, it will be rough going trying to figure out what the actors are saying to each other.  The film version, which was on television many years ago, either had subtitles or was dubbed in English, because I do remember that I enjoyed the movie experience.  I don't remember that the advertisement for the DVD specifically stating that the DVD would be in Spanish only, no subtitles.  The advertising needs to be more specific for the consumer's benefit.  Yes, I'm disappointed.",1433289600,4,800,4.866666666666666
4188273,5,B003SH6GKA,"In Spanish
The contralto should be a bit softer(most others on this piece are also too hard) the best one is Shirley Verrett, but Haven't been able to find her on CD doing El Amor Brujo",1433116800,,185,4.166666666666667
4188274,5,B003SH6GKA,"This is one for Flamenco or Spanish Dance specialists.  Brilliant dancing from what are
still considered the ""Best"" in their field.  The full length ballet score intertwined as a
musical.  If you do not understand Spanish (there are no subtitles) an understanding
of the story will help.",1429056000,4,287,5.0638297872340425
4188275,3,B003SH6GKA,they need to update the DVD tech used for this video... I was not able to play it on some players and it is an EXCELLENT piece of art!,1419724800,,134,3.6551724137931036
4188276,5,B003SH6GKA,"As ever, wonderful dancing, excellent presentation. Not all dancing is captured for TV so that one sees what and from where one wishes to view it, but Carlos Saura's productions are invariably satisfying.",1409961600,,204,5.212121212121212

4188279,1,B003SH6GKA,There was no movie at all on the screen. I was disappointed and would like my money back. They should check the quality of products before posting them for sale.,1356912000,,161,4.4
4188280,3,B003SH6GKA,"didn't realize there was no english subtitles, i had seen it long time ago on tv where there were and just assumed there was. at least i enjoy the music and dancing, and i remember enough of the plot to fill in what's missing. definitely made mental note to myself to check for this in the future for all video purchases, as i seem to like quite a lot of 'foreign' films.",1327017600,11,371,4.166666666666667

8404325,1,B003SH6GKA,"To repeat what others have said: NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES.  I have also enjoyed this film other times in other formats WITH subtitles, including a VHS tape I owned long ago.  Those versions do exist.  It's crazy that the description failed to mention this.  I bought the DVD in the U.S. from Amazon U.S..  Did no one consider that the American buyer should know about this?",1490400000,,369,4.615384615384615
8404326,4,B003SH6GKA,Great movie.  This edition doesn't have English subtitles and isn't as digitally mastered as the region 2 (European) version that I have with subtitles (but for which I lack a player--I should have bought a new DVD player instead of trying to replace the DVD).,1471392000,,260,4.777777777777778
8404327,5,B003SH6GKA,"I had this selection several years ago on VHS so I was
very happy to find it on DVD and in excellent condition
and so inexpensive.  If anyone appreciates flamenco
dancing and everything that makes this art form this is
a great movie to watch.",1466294400,,242,4.377777777777778
8404328,3,B003SH6GKA,"When compared to the Criterion edition, this copy is decidedly inferior.  But the film is first rate.  It lacks subtitles, so non Spanish speakers will miss some of the situations.  The plot can be somewhat deduced from the video.  The film is also slightly fuzzy compared to the Criterion edition.  Since the Criterion edition is out of print, this is one of the few chances you have to acquire a copy of the film.

The dancing is superb, and the music is wonderful.  The music is sometimes Flamenco guitar, but the Ballet by Manuel deFalla is the main score.  It closely follows the scenario of the ballet.  So if you really want a copy of this film, this is a reasonably priced one.  If you can get the Criterion Edition at a reasonable price, snap it up and you will have a sharp video with selectable subtites.  One wishes it were available on Blu-Ray.",1464739200,3,857,4.5
8404329,5,B003SH6GKA,"I have loved this movie since it was made in the 70s but never owned a copy. Now I do, and I still love it as much as when I first saw it!",1463875200,,138,3.212121212121212
8404330,1,B003SH6GKA,The written program that explains what is going on and what Carlos Saura was trying to do was missing from the album.,1463875200,,117,4.363636363636363
