2891890,3,B000T28G28,"I enjoyed watching Pokemon when I was growing up, and so when they released the box set I had to get it. Unfortunately, Viz Media doesn't quite live up to the anime DVD standards set by other companies. The overall lack of quality was really disappointing.

- The cases themselves feel really flimsy and weak. My first thought when I touched them was ""bootleg."" The box art is colorful but really kind of plain. It just didn't look as polished and professional as other anime DVDs, which was shocking since I dare say Pokemon is probably one of the most popular (or at least well-known) anime series of all time. Furthermore, there are no included inserts: just an episode list that looks exactly the same as the one on the back covers of each DVD. (I wonder why they even bothered?)

- DVD menus are colorful, albeit very plain and minimalistic (only options are ""play"" and ""episodes""). No Japanese track, and no subtitles. No extras either. You get the dubbed episodes plus the full Pokerap (which isn't a menu option, so you have to skip to it).

- Several episodes are skipped: ""The Legend of Miniryuu [Dratini],"" ""Electric Soldier Porygon,"" ""Princess versus Princess,"" and ""The Purr-fect Hero."" The first two episodes were never, as far as I can tell, broadcast on American television (the Porygon episode in particular has never been seen outside of its initial run in Japan, due to the seizure incident). The last two episodes WERE broadcast on American television, but are not included here; they are in the third box set. This doesn't mess up the chronology of things too much since Pokemon is a fairly episodic series, but sometimes weird ""holes"" pop up (like how Ash inexplicably has a bunch of Tauros that he caught in the Dratini episode, which we never got to see).

- These videos aren't uncut and uncensored, like what you'd find with most typical anime. That's fine with me, since it's not like 4Kids censored or cut a whole lot of stuff from these episodes anyway, but it's still worth noting here. Digital paint is out in full force, mostly just to cover up Japanese text that was present in the original. If you didn't care when you first saw these episodes on TV, you won't care now.

- The video and audio quality are beautiful, and exactly what I had hoped for. Certain scenes might seem kind of ""glitchy,"" but that's because the original animators went back and slowed down the framerate and muted the colors because of the infamous seizure incident. Those scenes really stick out and look funky and ridiculous, but that's not Viz's (or 4Kid's) problem.

Even though I love these episodes, I cannot in good conscience give this collection higher than three stars, an ""average"" rating: these DVDs contain only the bare minimum to be considered a ""collector's box set."" Poor production values, combined with zero extras and several missing episodes, hold this back from being really exceptional. If they threw in the Japanese track, a handful of extras, and stronger DVD cases, then we'll talk. As it stands, these are only slightly better than my old VHS recordings of the show, and those tapes didn't cost me $22.",1212883200,,3137,4.757352941176471
2891891,5,B000T28G28,"My son and I are avid watchers of the Pokemon series, and we were thrilled to find out that they were continuing to expand the boxset collections.  The Indigo League lays a great foundation for the series and is essential to all Pokemon fans to have! Video and Sound qualities are excellent.  A must have!",1204848000,,305,4.527272727272727
2891892,5,B000T28G28,"I don't want to repeat anyone else, so I'll just add some more information. Episodes not featured on this boxset, which I think is a shame, are 'The Legend of Dratini', 'Electric Solider Porygon', 'Princess Versus Princess', and 'The Purr-fect Hero'. Other than that, this is a fine looking boxset featuring wonderful episodes as good as Season 1 Part 1.

Like a previous reviewer had stated, you will notice that Jesse lost a Lickitung, but the episode where she caught one is not featured on this boxset. The same goes for James, with his Victreebel. I just wonder, are they ever gonna release the banned episodes on DVD? I sure hope so. They may be looked down upon, for whatever reason(s), but they are still Pokemon. It's fair and sensible to get the entire story.",1196899200,,769,4.696296296296296
2891893,4,B000T28G28,"This box set has a timeline issue. The Episode ""Princess Versus Princess"" (Production #201) is suppose to take place after ""Ditto's Mysterious Mansion"" and before ""So Near, Yet so Farfetch'd."" The reason is that during the ""Princess Versus Princess"" episode Jessie captures a Likatung which she loses in the episode ""So Near, Yet so Farfetch'd"" How can Jessie lose her Likatung if she hasn't caught it yet?. This is the only Time Paradox I have found with this box set so far. Other than that, it should be complete.",1196726400,,516,4.808988764044944
2891894,5,B000T28G28,"This is the second box set that has been released for Season One of Pokemon. Once again, this collector's set is only the 4kids American dub with no second Japanese version. Like the first box set, it contains three discs; each in a nice hard case that slide into one cardboard sleeve. The artwork on the box and each individual case is similar to the first. The set contains the second 26 episodes of season one. The third and final box set is due out in February, 2008.

Once again, the menus are decent but nothing spectacular. On box #4's menu, it has a picture of Ash and Pikachu. For some strange reason, he is wearing an outfit that appears only in a later season. Whether this was done intentionally or was a mistake, I do not know. When it comes to scene selection, each episode is divided into only two parts. The first, being before the commercial break, and the second, coming after the break. The video quality is descent.

According to Wikipedia, the Japanese version contains 83 episodes; three were originally banned in the U.S. One of those episodes was eventually aired (""Beauty and the Beach"") but has yet to show up on any DVD edition. That meaning, there should be 80 episodes that should be released as the final box set comes out. But if you notice on the third set, it says ""episodes 53-79."" A fourth episode may possibly not be released as the final set comes out in February. One theory may be that it is the ""Holiday Hi-Jinx"" episode that caused some controversy a few years back.

On another side-note, episodes 50-52 contain a character that is a Pokemon photographer. In its original airing, his name was referred to as Todd, but in this version, he is called Snapp--which was his real name according to the video game in which he belongs.

One nice thing that could be included in the DVDs would be the original TV spots for episodes that first aired on KidsWB! But seeing that Pokemon DVDs never have real extras, it would never happen. Overall, this is the best edition of season one part two that there is. It's worth the purchase if you do not mind the American version. I rate this product 5 out of 5 stars.",1196035200,12,2143,4.5012853470437015

2891926,4,B000T28G28,"Was extremely excited to see this finally get released on DVD.  No problems to speak of and the show is exactly as I remember it.  One issue, of a technical nature (perhaps fixed on newer pressings?) is that hitting ""next chapter"" during the intro theme will take you back to the start of the first episode on the disc rather than the start of the episode you're supposed to be on.  I guess it's a coding issue that there's only one Intro on the disc and it jumps back to that, then back to the episode it's supposed to be on.  Just don't hit ""skip"" or ""Next chapter"" during the intro and you're fine though.",1451779200,,608,4.260869565217392

2891970,5,B000T28G28,"Disclaimer: This review contains potential spoilers.

Indigo League Part 2, like its predecessor, comes with pretty nice box art. The heads at PUSA's marketing department decided to pay homage to Team Rocket this time around, which is refreshing since TR rarely gets featured on box art even though they play a prominent role in the series. That said, considering that Weezing and Arbok debut together in 'Dig Those Diglett,' it's odd that they went with Koffing and Ekans on the cover (Amazon's product image for the box art isn't up-to-date as of writing this review).

Plot-wise, Ash obtains only one badge in this second boxed set, but that doesn't mean that the season slows down one bit.  On the contrary, significant series development occurs in these 26 episodes.  For one, 'Pikachu's Goodbye' cements Ash and Pikachu's enduring bond with each other.  Other highlights include the lovable Jigglypuff's first appearance on the show - a Pokmon that quickly gained a fan cult-status and many repeated appearances in the episodes to follow.  There's also the infamous arranged marriage episode involving James - I'll leave it at that.

For the price it's going for on Amazon, this is not a bad deal if you like to re-watch the older episodes of Pokmon for nostalgia's sake.",1395446400,,1277,4.995283018867925

2892114,5,B000T28G28,"Picked up the first 2 box sets for my 2 year old son.  These shows used to be my daughter's favorites back in the day (she is 16 now).  We played a couple of her old VHS tapes for the little one and he was quite taken.  So I turned around a bought him the box sets so he could watch more than the 9 episodes we have on tape.  Each set has 3 discs containing around 10 episodes or so on each, which I consider a pretty good value for 30 bucks or so.  I will be getting the 3rd set soon.

My son likes all of the little creatures and the happy-go-lucky characters on the show.  And he is a big fan of the ""Poke-Rap"" song at the end of each disc.",1270166400,,643,3.753731343283582

Its great and better than the pokemon series that is currently showing now.
It comes from a time when pokemon wasn't so childish as it is now, having many jokes (now that I look at it again) that aren't kid friendly.
It's a nice price as well practically a dollar per an episode.
So what are you waiting for, go buy this boxset fellow pokefan.",1262304000,,418,4.2375

  If you (like my ten-year-old son and I) are a fan of Pokemon - the card game, the video games or any of the movies- you'll want to get this DVD. This three-disc set is the second of three in the boxed sets of the collected Indigo League series, the entire first year that the show was aired on television. See why James is such a dweeb- find out how Ash got his Thunder Badge- discover the secret of the Haunted Tower! All of this and more!",1229040000,,484,4.08421052631579

2892120,3,B000T28G28,"This box set contains episodes twenty-seven through fifty-two of the Pokemon anime series, which is spread out over three DVDs (the first two discs have nine episodes, while the third disc contains eight episodes).  There is only one extra included on each disc (the full-length ""Pokerap"").

Just like with the first box, it's obvious that Viz Media put this set together ""on the cheap.""  However, if you're a fan of Pokemon, you'll want to pick this up in order to have all the episodes on DVD.  In this set, Brock gets his Vulpix; Ash says goodbye to Primeape; Ash earns the Soul badge; Ash almost says goodbye to Pikachu; Ash and his friends encounter the prehistoric Pokemon; we learn more about James' past; Ash and his friends meet a photographer named Snap, who travels with them for a few episodes; Ash tries to take the Pokemon League exam; and we are first introduced to Butch and Cassidy, two other members of Team Rocket.

This set can actually be acquired for a decent price, considering what you get in the set.  If you're a Pokeman fan, you have to purchase this set in order to continue following Ash on his Pokemon journey.",1219708800,5,1140,4.646766169154229
