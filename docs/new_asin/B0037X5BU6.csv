4082479,5,B0037X5BU6,"I have several of those "" I M A X "" , 5.1 Channel, surround-sound movies. The VIDEO of this Blu-ray was of THAT quality. The AUDIO was
excellent as well, but was ""just"" DD 2.0 channel... which was faultlessly clear and adequate. The programs presented were VERY enjoyable!
Great two-parter; excellent price!
The PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS actually convey what you'll see.
DIDN'T read it? Here's a ""Readers' Digest"" recap: > > >
Part One--- OUR DRAMATIC PLANET:
a.) Kilimanjaro's Kibo Summit---- Kilimanjaro is not only the highest mountain in Africa, it's one of the biggest volcanoes on Earth,
covering an area of approximately 9.6 million acres.
b.) Step into the most beautiful hiking adventure in New New Zealand's Hollyford Track. It sits near Milford Sound on New Zealand's
South Island.
c.) Nearly five million people visit the mile deep Grand Canyon each year, yet, most of them see it from their car. Here is a
""deeper look"" into the Canyon with the world's top HD cinematographers bringing everything into focus.

Part Two--- ROMANCE WITH NATURE:
a.) Ireland's Dingle Way---------Situated in remote south west Ireland, the Dingle Way is one of over 30 Irish long-distance walking
trails.
b.) Alaska's Chilkoot Pass-----Alaska's most famous, historic, trail is part of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park.
c.) Salzkammergut---------------No! Arnold isn't named after this, beautiful, Austrian area. It IS a diverse region of sparkling lakes
and thick, forested hills surrounded by beautiful romantic villages. < < <",1462406400,5,1530,5.270491803278689

Don't get me wrong, I love the shows and it is great for seeing a true hike that my old bones can not do anymore.  Well worth the price of admission.",1433030400,5,267,4.076923076923077

8390838,5,B0037X5BU6,"I bought this because of trying to show my twin 12 year old boys what is going on in our natural world every minute of everyday !!
  That we need to protect our home our earth.  To see places that we may never go to together we went there today together.  The video of grand Canyon I have been to phantom ranch 3 times I showed them pictures that I took that are in the video also.
  For them to be able to ask me questions about my travels and the adventures ahead for us.  This is the video series that let's you take a scenic walk around some beautiful places I wish we could go to someday also.
Very inspiring ..",1471564800,2,616,4.0
