8718573,3,B00YNU4CFW,"When I made original order, Amazon product description/photo showed CFR HonkyTonk as 5 DVD discs including  the main program (4DVD discs) and separately boxed ""Backstage"" 1DVD disc. I only received main program 4 DVD's without ""Backstage"". I am very dissapointed, as I wanted & paid for the complete 5DVD disc program. Amazon advised ""Inventory"" problem & cannot supply ""Backstage"" 1DVD disc. Amazon have now altered product description/photo to show 4DVD's (main program only), without separate ""Backstage"" 1DVD for the same full price US$79.80 . This is occurring whenever the CFR set of  5DVD discs product including the separately boxed  ""Backstage"" 1DVD is ordered. Very disappointing as to this unresolved issue.
