8445381,5,B004WOAGEU,"As a child, I loved reading Astrid Lindgren's stories about Pippi Longstocking and her amazing adventures, and used to watch the TV show as well. I was delighted to discover the animated series of Pippi Longstocking on DVDs at my local library. Now my first grader can enjoy the stories as well. There are several DVD titles of Pippi Longstocking and each DVD has about four episodes.

This particular DVD is titled ""Pippi Goes to the Fair"" and contains four episodes with a total running time of 88 minutes. The episodes are Pippi Goes to the Fair, Pippi Enters a Horse Show, Pippi Takes a Train Ride, and Pippi Enters a Flower Show. There are positive messages in here to inspire young children ages 4-8 while entertaining them. The themes focus on friendship, courage, and learning new things.",1320969600,,796,4.768115942028985
