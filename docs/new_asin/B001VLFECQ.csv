If you want your children to see the animals worshiping the devil then saying it was a dream and that the animals were pleasantly possessed by the devil and his music is heavenly, this is what you will get.  I had the Disney book when I was a child and this was certainly not in it, so I didn't watch the video myself but just had them sent to my grandchildren.  Then I watched it on youtube just to make sure it was okay and am still horrified that I saw what was in it.  Should have thought about a frog that does all sorts of bad things with no repercussions...he even escapes from prison with no problems after.  An incorrigible problem animal.  It is not a good thing for children to watch and I wish I hadn't seen the devil part.  UGH!!!!!  Fortunately I got in touch with all before they watched it.",1438300800,,854,4.164634146341464

It had to have been that way when I purchased it because it was sent in a very secure box.  I just wish the advertisement for the Wind in the Willows would have stated that its container was crushed. Had I known the case was crushed I would have bought somewhere else.",1326412800,,384,4.026315789473684
