8188091,4,B000P0QOJG,"When I was watching ""Cardcaptors"" when it was still on Kids WB, I don't remember anything about a movie. I'm 16 years old now, it's been a really long time since I've seen it on TV, and I actually forgot about it (it was my mom who actually remembered it, LOL, she loves the show too). So when we found out there was a movie, I decided to go ahead and buy it (It's Cardcaptors, the movie will probably be awesome).
It is an awesome movie! The animation is slightly better than the show (as all animated movies for shows are), there are alot of hilarious scences, and the story is very interesting.

Sakura wins a trip for 4 to Hong Kong in a raffle, so she brings Madison, Tory, and Julian with her (and she brings Kero in her purse), but she didn't win by chance....the lady in her dreams wanted her there. The woman was really trying to summon Clow Reed (the two fell in love, but she became evil, so he had no choice but to trap her in another dimension) but since Sakura had the cards, she sensed his magic in her, and thought it was Clow. And of course, when she sees her, she's like ""You're not Clow Reed! You're just a little girl! Where is he?""
It's really exciting, go watch it for yourself!

The only thing I was disappointed was this DVD. It says it's 'special edition' but the menu only has two options; ""Play Movie"" and ""Music Video""
There is no scene selection, movie trailer, commentary, or all that regular stuff you get in DVDs, not even closed captions! (I like being able to have subtitles, so if I have to be quiet, I can still watch the movie). All it has is the movie and the 'No Nagging' video by Froggy Mix (which is cool, by the way). Aside from that, it's a GREAT movie!

So if you remember Cardcaptors and had no idea there was a movie, you have to get it! You don't know what you're missing out on! ^_^
