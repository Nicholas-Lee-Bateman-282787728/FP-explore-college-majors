After a  dramatic twist near the end of the movie, the ending is much better than  the ending of The Sixth Sense. I won't spoil it for you, but I will just  say there are dinosaurs that are human size, and there is a nice pancake  scene at the end of the movie between the barbarian, a anklyosaurus, and  the fat guy from Jurassic Park!

884657,1,6304384211,"This is an awful, lying movie.  First, let's look at the title.  ""Nymphoid"" - No, there were NO NYMPHOIDS.  Nothing nymphoidic happened at all.  At the beginning the Nymphoid says: 'sometimes my juices  get flowing and I get so hot'.  Well, at no time did the juices get  flowing.  ""Barbarian"" - They wore EXTREMELY CLEAN, yet artfully  ragged clothes.  I guess that makes them barbarians.  ""Dinosaur  Hell"" - First of all, they weren't dinosaurs, they were 'mutated  pets'.  Secondly, in Dinosaur Hell, I'd expect there to be lots of scary  dinosaurs.  There were neither lots of dinosaurs, nor were they scary.  Every now and again the lobotomized chimp that wrote this tripe would  remember to throw in something lizardy that would roar a little.  Woooo.  The stop motion in this movie wasn't terrible, but that's the only thing  that wasn't.  The plot drug on and on, there was next to no gore or  nudity...  The only good thing was a trailer for another (more promising)  Troma flick called something along the lines of ""Murdering Nurses Find  Passion.""  A TRAILER WAS THE ONLY GOOD THING!

The end does not reach a big conclusion - it does wrap up the story, with a sense that more adventures will come.

As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

The cons:

The quality of the acting isn't great, but thankfully, as the actors are playing barbarians, there aren't a ton of complicated lines or complicated emotions to get across. The script is also a little meandering... maybe a lot meandering.

The pros:

Like with other Brett Piper projects, the real attraction of the film is the old-school Ray Harryhausen-type stop motion effects. Second to that, the attraction might be scantily-clad women. Those two attractions remain the same nearly two decades later on the Brett Piper & Polonia Brothers team-up film Muckman!

""A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell"" might be Pipers best-known film, so its important in his filmography. Its sort of mindless, but like with other Piper films, thats part of the charm. Its a goofy sword-and-sorcery drama that doesnt demand any more of you than your average episode of ""Land of The Lost"".

Pipers special effects can be enjoyed on multiple levels. At times they're goofy in the way the dinosaurs are on ""Land of the Lost"" (another reference to LOTL, as long as I have that show on the brain): you can tell they're fake, but at the same time you're thinking, Thats a pretty cool model, or puppet, or whatever the hell they're using.  At other times, you're kind of surprised that his effects look as good as Hollywood-style effects, although Hollywood-style effects circa 1970.",1482883200,,1540,4.964980544747082

884892,3,6304384211,"I would give this move 2.5 stars, but that's just not an option. So I decided to be generous and give this film three stars instead.

Let me get this out of the way right from the get-go, just in case you were wondering if the inclusion of the word ""Nymphoid"" means this was going to be a skin-flick, you were mistaken. There is indeed a topless moment (i.e. a few seconds) around the 1:12 mark, where the only woman in the movie (Lea, played by Linda Corwin) has her top forcibly removed. She is laying down, and not particularly well-endowed, but if you wanted to see boobs there is the one chance you have in this film.

There are a lot of misleading factors that would lead you to think this movie is something it's not. The very cover art here in Amazon depicts nothing that is in the movie; the dinosaurs are ""mutated animals"" and don't resemble T-rexes, the villain doesn't look like that and Lea doesn't look anything like the woman presented. Following that, the introductary narrative is voiced by NOT Linda Corwin, and includes the phrase (to the effect of) ""sometimes my juices get flowing"", indicating some sexuality would be present in the movie. Except the topless moment noted, the movie isn't sexy.

Once the movie actually gets going, it's very remiscent of the animated film ""Fire and Ice"". There is limited dialgoue, and the movie centers around a young man attempting to rescue a young woman that is captured by a sort of warlord. There is a helpful masked stranger with an axe (also reminiscent of Fire and Ice), and some inhuman minions, and for some reason a skull fortress. I guess architects are still around after the apocolypse to help make these things for aspiring warlords.

The movie as a whole reminds me of an attempt by some very talented amateurs to make a feature film. The costumes in the move are actually quite well done (given the low-budget and that the movie was made in 1990), but the stop-motion creatures are pretty awful. The dialogue is stilted, but the old man is alright, although he should have ab-libbed some of his lines. The villain is definitely a tough bastard. There are no stuntmen, so the violence is absolutely at the amatuer level, with lots of slow fights and pulled punches.

 There must have been some attempt to keep it close to 90 minutes, because about 20 minutes could have ben edited out to have a much tighter film.

I can't fully recomment you see this film, but if you understand you are going to watch a low-budget amateurish attempt at film-making, it isn't the worst thing I've ever seen.",1466121600,5,2563,4.607456140350878

The 1980s hair styles add to the mystique of the production and the costumes (not nearly as sophisticated as you will see at your favorite ""con"") add a texture to the fuzzy film quality that really puts the whole movie into a a tidy and surreal package.

They packaged the movie as silly. The title and the valley girl voice over intro and the Troma title card tell you this is going to be a funny, farcical parody of a post apocalypse movie. But the people who made the movie did it completely seriously. Apart from the title and opening this movie is a serious attempt to make a monster feature with a dark rapey vibe and scary monsters. It even has scenes where I think we're meant to be mourning the fallen civilization. Long, dull scenes where all we do is look at artifacts from the ""past"".

I might have enjoyed the movie if they just called it Survival In The Mutant Wasteland or something and cut that valley girl intro. Probably not. Maybe I would have enjoyed it in a so bad it's good way. But mostly I was just disappointed it was a serious dark movie instead of a farcical one.",1448841600,2,920,4.312138728323699

The most anticipated part of any Piper movie is the special effects, which always utilize archaic stop motion technology to bring a fantastic world to life. What separates Piper's films apart is that his creations almost uniformly have an unmistakable character about them that no one else can create. In this case, a Piper acquits himself well with several creatures, including a flying pterosaur, water lizard and giant work. All of them bely the minuscule budget and are a joy to behold.

The problem is the rest of the movie. To put it nicely, it's a boring slog through an almost story-less series of happenings that seem to build to nothing and leave the film with an aura of pointlessness reminiscent of the great works of HG Lewis, Ted Mikels and Doris Wishman. Nothing ever seems to resolve and nobody bothers to get the audience invested in anything except for the next special effect.

There's obviously a lot of talent behind this movie, yet none of it is realized unless it's a fleeting glimpse of a matte painting or some expert model work. And if this were a 20 minute talent reel, that'd be great; however, this is a movie and, without a usable story, it fails to be worth the time.",1408060800,6,1445,4.772

Then its a bit faster and a lot more interesting then the original plot. Plus Piper gives you some info on how to and not to shoot a 16mm film. Not a digital film but a 16mm film. I wish I had his talent to do stop motion animation. His quality which he knocks constantly is still good. He should be proud of what he has done. He's lucky TROMA is too cheap to edit and that name, NYMPHOID BARBARIAN is stupid but people remember it and it is probably why the film is so famous. Either it's Kaufman's genius or he's  just darn lucky. I like the creatures and monsters in this film. They're not dinosaurs, that's Kaufman's fabrication but they are still interesting, entertaining creations and they are never boring. I like the fortress, the swamp 'thing', the water creatures in the moat, even the trolls and goon men that chase the girl. She was a good casting choice with a nice figure and large expressive eyes. Her beau in the film was good also. I hear he's a P.E. Teacher now. I wish I was able to assist in this film. MR.

The problem is not the movie but imagination--there was no plot or attempt, everything predictable and impression was Troma was trying something to see if they can make money. This female  had nice bikini but men never tried to take advantage of situation, I guess female nudity cost too much for Troma to afford. Well, it cost too much for me here, in Florida, so I have to travel to Far East. Yeah, whatever.",1367798400,,558,4.6938775510204085
885652,1,6304384211,"I purchased thid DVD because I remember it as a Young Adult.  I knew in advance there was no nudity.

What I received appears to be a COPY of the original.  It is on a DVD-R that has a silk-screen label and on the burn side the place where the write finished is clearly visible.  The box Cover Art is like the image on the Amazon site with the exception that there are ""DVD-R"" stickers on the front, side and back of the case.  The stickers are on the pull-out cover and not on the clear plastic protective outer layer.  These labels do NOT appear on the thumbnail on the Amazon.com site!

Production DVD's do not look like this.

This leads to two possibilities:
1)  Troma Released the CHEAPEST DVD yet, cutting corners all all fronts.
2)  The merchant that is selling these through Amazon.com (though Amazon. Com is listed as the seller) made these from a VHS tape (yes, the quality leads me to think VHS).  The movie is grainy and at times you can see streaks, though there are not many of them.

So, if Troma released this movie this way, they charged too much for it.  If Troma did not, then we have a case of Piracy and the merchant should be banned from selling anything on Amazon.com.

I hope Amazon replies to this so I will know one way or the other.",1344470400,,1260,4.283898305084746
885653,5,6304384211,"Okay--let me get this off my chest first. I got pretty annoyed with a few of the 'reviews' for this Tromariffic Treat, so let me begin by calling ' ' a knucklehead...my friend, you obviously don't know much about Troma flicks. Your never going to get Academy Award performances OR million dollar CGI effects in a Troma flick. And to ''--what movie were YOU watching??? This is set in a post-apocalyptic FUTURE not 'prehistoric times' you ninny! See, there is an audience for films like this. We fondly call them 'so bad that they are good'...but honestly, this one isn't really all that bad! Paying homage to the great Ray Harryhausen 'Sinbad' films and the Post-Apocalyptic genre (such as 'Deathsport', 'Mad Max', 'The Road Warrior', etc.), 'A Nymphoid...' shows us a bleak world in which mutated humans and animals (turned into 'dinosaur-like' monsters) are more prevalent than 'normal folk'--especially attractive females! So begins our tale in which a scantily-clad hottie almost has a 'train' pulled on her by 3 skeezoids...rhat is until an equally attractive young 'barbarian' warrior uses his muscle and wits to rescue her. I won't spoil much of the plot, but I will tell you this--despite a shoe-string budget, the director and effects team DO manage to pull out all the stops and deliver a super monster-mash of stop-motion surprises! Kudos to the effects team for killer creature designs and great life-like movement! There are also a few puppet creations that pop up along the way, but I have seen MUCH worse in a low-budget film. There is even a VERY cool masked deformed barbarian warrior who gets a decent amount of screen time, and a cool villian who really gets his sleaze on (note: the credits mention an actor named 'K. Alan Hodder'--could it be KANE Hodder of 'Jason'/'Victor Crowley' fame in one of those costumes?)! All-in-all, if you don't have much of a home sex-life, and your looking for pseudo porn, go rent a porno from behind the curtain of your local video shop--because this isn't THAT kind of Troma flick. But if your an old-school 'Famous Monsters' fan and dig old classics like 'Equinox', '7th Voyage Of Sinbad', along with cheesy post-apocalyptic action fare like 'Nemesis', then this one is for YOU!",1249862400,7,2234,4.912698412698413
