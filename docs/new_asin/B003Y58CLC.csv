I apologize for my non-musical adjectives but this opera is cute, enjoyable, fun, beautiful and full of smiles.
For anyone who thinks opera is for old starched shirts, check this one out and you will be hooked on this art form!!
We have seen scores of operas, most are enjoyable, some are wonderful. This La Rondine is by far one of my favorites!!",1291334400,15,435,4.253012048192771
4219073,2,B003Y58CLC,The Met has never done La Rondine in my lifetime of 60 years. Why they decided to stage it and update it is beyond me. It would have been nice to first see it in the period in which it is written before seeing a re-interpretation but decision at The Met make no sense whatsoever. Mr. and Mrs. Alagna are the big draw here and I have to say they are not my favorite for this opera. She acts the part very well but there's a sub-Callas flutter in her voice that I don't find appealing and frankly the tone of her voice is more serviceable than glorious.  I vastly prefer Kiri Te Kanawa and Anna Moffo on audio recordings.  Roberto is generally in good voice but he stills sings sharp and then flat at times. The direction of this video is stodgy. It's as if live television direction hasn't changed in twenty five years. I do wish Alan Skoog had been available for this one.,1290470400,19,872,4.246987951807229
4219074,5,B003Y58CLC,"Puccini composed his lovely lyrical opera La Rondine (The Swallow) between autumn 1913 and spring 1916. Completed during the height of the first world war, its premiere was moved to neutral territory in Monte-Carlo in 1917. The trauma of the war was an inevitable mood deflator and early audiences found it difficult to warm-up to a work fashioned after that quintessential pre-war opera: Der Rosenkavalier. A second version of La Rondine followed after the war in 1920 at Teatro Massimo, Palermo and a third version premiered many years later in Turin in 1994. La Rondine has remained at the periphery of Puccini's output until recently. Championed by Alagna and Gheorghiu, it has begun to gather momentum and the work is slowly entering the repertory.

I managed to acquire a copy of this DVD in Europe so eager was I to see this production again. Originally broadcast January 10, 2009 in theaters in high definition, this standard definition DVD still looks good with beautifully crisp, densely saturated colors and superb DTS 5.1 and PCM 2,0 sound. This production is gorgeous with a generous sampling of Art Deco furniture and 1920s period costumes that are vibrant and beautiful. The staging is energetic with that sense of life that is so important for a successful realization of a Puccini opera. All performances are exemplary with those of bass Samuel Ramey and the two leads especially good. Alagna is in fine voice and his acting is stoic and solid but it is Gheorghiu who is riveting in her touching portrayal of the newly freed 'swallow' from a lifetime of caged confinement. Her acting has rarely if ever been better. She is as vulnerable as Mimi, as resolute as Tosca but always herself. Gheorghiu owns this role at the moment and she is creating a template for future performances. Her voice is beautifully lyrical with a lilting purity that matches her characterization perfectly. It is a hard heart indeed that will fail to be moved by her flame-like performance.

Puccini's music has never been more elegant or beautiful. It is amazing that this lovely opera remains so little heard. With performances as brilliant as this one I doubt that will continue for much longer. If you are a devotee of Puccini you will probably love this staging of his still rarely performed but nearly perfect creation: La Rondine. It is a performance of rare elegance and taste, suffused with the autumnal musical beauty of an artist at twilight.

4219080,5,B003Y58CLC,"This is an opera not often seen, from Puccinis repertoire and I don't really know why. When performed properly, its almost as enjoyable and intense as Bohme or Butterfly.

 This is not a period-correct or traditionally-costumed version of this opera and, normally, that would tend to cause me to downgrade it. However, moving it into the 1920s of Paris does not hurt it, in the slightest.

 In this instance, they not only made it work but work perfectly. The quality of the singing was first rate, as was the acting. The obvious chemistry, between real-life husband and wife Gheorghiu and Alagna, is obvious and makes this work, as a believable, doomed lovers story.

4219082,2,B003Y58CLC,"Miss Gheorghiu really isn't suitable for this roll.  She just about got through Doretta's first act aria (which I admit isn't the easiest to sing right off the bat).  The rest of her performance was cool and seemed unattached. Mr. Algna  seemed to be in good voice and more involved in the opera.

4219087,4,B003Y58CLC,"This Met production is one of the most enjoyable I have seen in years.  Angela more interested in showing herself off, but comes across very well.  Alagna (since they were still married at the time) was a real lover and he sings very well.  The only cast member who should have skipped this opera was Sam Ramey.  He is very sad.  The production is more relaxed than that of Washington Opera, and the ending of that production is silly.",1395187200,,435,4.455696202531645

4219095,4,B003Y58CLC,"Quite amazing this is seen so rarely. The music is wonderful with some blockbuster arias but not as memorable as La Boheme or Madama Butterfly. I absolutely love the 1920 setting...but a kept woman theme seeking romantic freedom from her stodgy benefactor can be transported to any century. I believe Gheorghiu and Alagna make a fine romantic pair with darn good acting. Not the best soprano and tenor of the last generation but more than adequate. I found Lisette adorable and a fine singer...but her lover Brenciu I found weak at times. The most disappointing person in the cast was Ramey, who sounded out of tune and discordant even shaky at times. The picture quality and sound were great as were the subtitles and staging. What I really appreciate is the MET HD series at the movie theatre. If I had not seen this opera at the movies I never would have considered it. Worth adding to you library.",1333411200,2,901,4.672955974842767
4219096,5,B003Y58CLC,"I knew nothing about this Opera until advised of it by Amazon. Was interested as it was a Met performance, and the first time in 70 years since they last performed it. I had heard Angela Gheorghiu sing previously and liked her. The tenor was unknown to me. I have a couple of Puccini operas and am very fond of La Boheme. The setting was unusual, as it was set in the 1920s, but fitted with the story line. The voices good. While Roberto Alagna fell behind a little vocally, he made up for it in his acting ability. The love scenes were very true to life. The final ""death scene"", as there was no actual death of anything other than the relationship between the pair, was beautifully presented. I understood why it was so lifelike and emotional when I viewed the interviews of the cast, which was an extra, to find that Angela and Roberta are in fact husband and wife! Having only viewed this opera the once I still don't ""know"" it well, but know it well enough to say it is very watchable, and will certainly be re-visited in the future. I agree with many other reviewists, it should not have been ""lost"", and any persons enjoying other Puccini operas need to have it in their collections.",1332201600,,1190,4.413636363636364
4219097,5,B003Y58CLC,"I had tickets to see this performance live at the Met but b/c of an unfortunate cold I had to give up my tickets & I still rue the day since this was the last time Alagna & Gheourgiu ever performed at the Met together.  I was THRILLED when this DVD came out!

One of Puccini's lesser known operas, it is one of my favorites & the setting of 1920's Paris makes it a nice change from the original version.  Everything is wonderful, from the costumes, to the sets, the acting, & of course the singing.  Alagna & Gheourgiu are at their best & the love story they portray is magical.  (You would never know that at the time they were starting the proceedings of a nasty divorce!)  Alagna's singing in the final scene is the most touching moment of opera I have ever seen.

Try this opera - you won't be disappointed!",1325721600,3,811,4.261437908496732
4219098,5,B003Y58CLC,"Why La Rondine is not considered on par with Puccini's ""big three"" is beyond me.  One melodic theme follows another, and in revisiting several of them throughout the opera, the Met's 2008 production of La Rondine is a delight for the senses.  In fact, from a purely musical standpoint, in its entirety, it's my favorite opera to listen to on CD. Is there a segment that might compare to Mimi and Rodolfo's or Floria and Mario's Act I love duets in La Boheme and Tosca? Hmmm... probably not.  But nevertheless, it is a thoroughly delightful score that Puccini has given us.

  The staging and costumes, set in the 1920's, provide a beautiful setting in which to enjoy the outstanding performances by the four principles.  Angela Gheorghiu was ""under the weather"" for this performance?  Apperently so, from what we're told ... but there is no evidence of this in her performance.  Her singing and acting are just what I've come to expect and enjoy from one of my favorite sopranos.  Brava !!!

  Equally as brilliant in performance as Ms. Gheorghiu are tenor Marius Brencu as the poet Prunier, and his (secret and mutual) love interest Lisette, performed by the adorable Lisette Oropesa.  Their amusing and witty interplay throughout the opera brings a smile to my heart whenever I reflect upon it.  And holding his own, in the role of Ruggero is Ms. Gheorghiu's (soon to be in real life ex) husband Roberto Alanga, and performing up to his usual fine standards.

  Overall, wonderful melodies by Puccini, a beautiful setting and outstanding performances make this an opera performance I'll treasure.  Picture and sound quality are fine :-)

Update (April 2013)  This remains one of my favorite opera DVDs ... and today I see that it sells for only $11 !!!  I encourage anyone remotely interested in opera to add this DVD to his or her collection.

  Becoming more and more used to blu-ray video, some of my DVDs end up looking poor in comparision ... this Met production, thankfully, does not.
  The image, while not up to blu-ray standards, does not have me wishing for a blu-ray re-issue.

  Musically, the wonderful melodies which Puccini wrote, are as enjoyable now as when I first heard them.",1315785600,5,2196,4.809651474530831
4219099,5,B003Y58CLC,"I remember the highlights of this opera, a Cetra Recording, from the early 50's, I believe.  The music stayed with me for years but, I didn't recall the name of the opera.  How nice to have it back in very enjoyable performance.",1312243200,2,228,4.404761904761905
4219100,5,B003Y58CLC,"Of the four DVD versions of La Rondine that I own this is the most satisfying.  The video director, Brian Large, has taken the stage production and crafted an intimate, visual treat.  His use of close ups creates an intimacy not available to the audience present in a 3600 seat opera house.  The experience was breathtaking and emotionally riveting.  I was not able to get tickets to the MET for any of the performances.  I did however see the HD broadcast at a local theater -- in the theater I thought that the images were washed out and the color pallette pale, not so with this DVD.  The use of earth colors for the set and virtually every other costume except for those worn by Ms Gheorghiu provides a striking contrast.  The images are good.  The vocal performances are very satisfying.  My only complaint is that while recording in high definition the MET is only putting out standard DVDs of its programs.  This program would be worth the price of blu ray for the enhanced image resolution and the better quality sound; I would love to hear this performance in DTS master HD audio.  If you have never seen La Rondine or think that this is a ""light weight"" minor opera you must watch this version.  I think you will change your mind and grow to love this work.",1300492800,8,1267,4.4847161572052405
4219101,5,B003Y58CLC,"The music is beautiful.  The performance is so delightful that one wants to play it over and over again, and I did.  Then, why is it that this opera is so seldom performed?  There was a gap of 73 years between two MET performances (1936 and 2009).  Angela Gheorghiu's response was ""This is a difficult opera to perform"", without saying why.  My translation:  it is difficult to put together four main characters like the present four.  Angela is becoming one of my all-time favorite sopranos.  Lisette Oropesa as Lisette is so cute and feminine.  She adds so much charm.  Even Roberto Alagna, the weakest of the four, delivers an emotion-packed performance.

The Amazon reviews are helpful.  Thanks to Ivy Lin's comments, coupled with the abominable reviews of Marta Domingo in the Washington National Opera (WNO) version, the decision on which DVD to buy was easy.  The ending could not be better.  It is simultaneously serene and passionate.  As a result, the final love scene comes across powerful, something that stabbing and violence cannot deliver.  It helps to have Samuel Ramey slip in quietly in the dark background at the very end.....subtle and imaginative, accompanied by beautiful melodies.  It is Puccini to the very end.

I saw the ending of the WNO version on Utube, and detested it.  Having said that, WNO is still my favorite opera company, just as the Washington Redskins is my favorite sports team - in spite of Marta Domingo and Dan Snyder.  Marta Domingo disrespects Puccini, and thinks she can do better.  She is destroying this beautiful opera.  She did not earn her position as a director at WNO.  There is corruption in opera, just as in politics.

This La Rondine version will pass the test of time in memorable fashion.",1297987200,10,1747,4.84406779661017
4219102,5,B003Y58CLC,"I have been a champion of this opera for many years.  I always wince when someone calls it a minor effort on Puccini's part.  This is one of his most plush and romantic scores, at least I think so.  And the story is believable and bittersweet as the two leads end their love affair, wiser but sadder.

The DVD's audio and visual quality is superb.  I do not have an HD TV set or a Blue Ray player but my Sony Vega Trinitron bursts into color and clarity from the first moment.

Life seems to imitate art here.  When I first saw this performance as an HD simulcast, there were rumors about Gheorghiu and Alagna's marriage falling apart which makes the ending sadder.  And there is that little exchange the couple has with hostess Fleming that was embarrassing then as it is now.

Never-the-less, she's in wonderful voice here and sings with the same attention to the text and music she displays on the EMI recording made almost a decade before this performance.  When I saw the simulcast, an announcement was made that she was ill but agreed to sing that afternoon.  The first aria which is a punishing one at that to sing almost immediately after the first act begins, is a little on the rough side without the ease she usually displays in her upper register.  But she does warm up fairly quickly with her voice at full volume over the huge ensemble in the second act.  Alagna is showing signs of vocal decline.  High notes are challenging here and his tone has lost much of its lovely luster, probably from singing too many heavy roles and never really learning how to sing.  He cuts a handsome figure on stage, as always, and is convincing as a nave young man from the provinces who finds love his first night in Paris.  The least said about veteran bass-baritone Samuel Ramey, the better.  Although cast in a small role, one could even say a comprimario role, this wonderful artist's time has come to leave the stage.

I love the production although I would have preferred it stage during opera's real period.

The conducting and the choral work are first rate Met.  This is an excellent performance despite my reservations about Alagna's vocal problems and the fact that Ramey's voice is extremely well past it's shelf life.",1295740800,22,2228,4.578282828282828
4219103,4,B003Y58CLC,"I am so glad to see a new production of one of my favorite operas.

Puccini for some reason was not happy with it but he was wrong.  It's great bitter-sweet  theater.  There's a modulation in the score at the beginning that I could swear ushered in Nino Rota's whole output.. his music is.very Puccinian at its best.  The comic scenes are well handled and the second tenor a delight.  There's almost a significant love theme in the libretto that is never quite fulfilled.
