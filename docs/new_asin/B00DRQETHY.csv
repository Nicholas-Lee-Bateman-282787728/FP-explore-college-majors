5851369,4,B00DRQETHY,"I thought I would be repulsed to watch a movie about someone faking a slip and fall to make money and that it would be stupid. But before I knew it I was really into it. The movie takes you through a journey of this average kid (Danny) who is just trying to get through life and law school. He is trying to take care of his Grandma who has totally lost it while living in her trailer, going to law school and paying his tuition. When Grandma blows his student loan check on a massive satellite dish that is so huge it tips the trailer (seriously), he has to figure out how to pay it. By the way, it is the kid's last semester and he has a great job waiting for him as long as he graduates. You totally feel his pain. Then comes the Dean of his law school who, in some way is that average jerk of a dean we've seen in films ranging from Animal House to Old School. But after watching this guy (played by Andrew Divoff), I almost feel like all the other ""deans"" I have watched are the same and possess the same stereotypical traits. You can tell the guy is bright but he is wholly unscrupulous, amoral and condescending like I have never seen before (the best is the theme music that goes along with his character). This guy not only declines to give Danny any help but is going to make life as hard as he can. The antagonistic relationship is almost too much in your face but I found myself laughing at how hateful the Dean was.
Of course the set-up made things feel very predictable, but the best part of the movie was not how it ended but how it got there. In other words, the predictability wound up not to matter.  What makes this movie is Danny's journey and the various characters who he encounters that make the movie. William Forsythe plays the likeable conman with a completely delusional sense of what is right and wrong but he is so convincing you almost buy his rationale. It is hilarious how convinced he is that his scams are ""the right thing to do."" He convinces Danny to fake a slip and fall in the most loveable and cunning way. Then you meet this cast of crazy characters who are part of making the fake `slip-and-fall' a financial success. The part of the personal injury lawyer is played by William DeCoff (Jimmy) who lifts weights and tans in his office (he has a tanning machine!) Then all he cares about is telling stories about fist fights, drinking and having sex. This guy is sensational, albeit a bit offensive. Then there is the Russian ""Doctor"" who is signing off on Danny's back injury because his arm is hurt. The guy's office is in this seedy dungeon with Forsythe pushing the whole thing along. Then comes ""Rocky"" the chiropractor who is unabashedly fraudulent (and hilariously stupid) and whose girlfriend doles out sexual favors behind his back! Oh, and then there is Morty Goldfarb making random appearances on televisions. He's that local lawyer celebrity always on t.v. inviting people to use him to sue other people.
The beauty of this film is its cleverness in weaving the main storyline in with two female relationships and a legal processes and theories that leave you with an interesting philosophical question. And while predictable, there were several twists and turns that I did not see coming and make the movie tie together nicely in the ending. You root for Danny but are more intrigued and amused with the process and characters throughout the movie. Alan Dershowitz plays a cameo making the court room scenes feel real. Overall, not your typical dumb comedy but rather a comedic ride with interesting characters and most important fun to watch.",1377907200,4,3594,4.52073732718894
5851370,4,B00DRQETHY,"I was psyched to watch this movie when I saw the title and premise
completely ripping ambulance chaser attorneys and the whole personal injury
business. And then I was surprised when the film actually exceeded my
already elevated expectations. Although I liked the concept, the movie's
poster made me think I was only going to see a lot of cheesy one liners and
dumb jokes. Instead, I got a fun story line with witty humor and even an
intellectual side that kept my interest. While it did start slow for me, it
really picked up and was a lot of fun after the first ten minutes. The main
character, ""Danny"" is totally relatable with his financial challenges,
dysfunctional family, and his need to use desperate measures for desperate
times. You totally feel bad for this kid who gets in way over his head. But
the whole cast of characters in this movie is really what makes it worth
watching. William Forsythe plays the likeable conman,  Andrew Divoff plays a
great narcissistic Dean, and William DeCoff steals the show as the
completely crazy, out-of-control slimy ambulance-chasing attorney (Jimmy
O'Malley). You've got to see this guy-one of the best characters I have seen
in years. He puts shame on any other comedic impressionists of Bostonians.
My wife cringed at times but then would find him oddly loveable. Plus, there
is a sweet romantic side that she loved. People will be quoting lines from
Jimmy O'Malley.

Aside from Jimmy, the thing that impressed me the most was the different
ways the movie was funny and enjoyable. It was exceptionally crass at times,
but then really subtle. It would be sophomoric one minute, then really witty
the next. It keeps you on your toes while you try and watch all of these
absurd characters get out of their own way. I am so sure stuff went by me
and over my head that I want to watch it again.",1377907200,5,1841,4.661538461538462
5851371,5,B00DRQETHY,"I try to keep my entertainment mixed, I do lean more towards horror then any other genre because it's my personal favorite but comedy i defiantly a close second. The problem I'm having with most comedy lately though is the majority of it is just rehashed fart and sex jokes that Troma did 20 years ago, and while i like a good fart or sex joke here and there still as im getting older its getting...tiresome i guess, you see Troma and other companies in the 70's and 80's incorporated sight gags and slapstick along with the sex and farts, nowadays it's literally just farts or dicks or boobs, a film could come out called dicks farting on boobs and it'd probably sell out theaters and win an award...Its just not my thing. So whenever i have a chance to check out more subtle humor i take it, which is why i got SLIP AND FALL.

SLIP AND FALL is the tale of Danny Cuemdumpstier, a shy, akward twentysomthing law student who lives in the woods with his not quite right grandmother. Danny only wants to finish law school and go work for a firm so he can hold onto his sex crazed money hungry russian girlfriend and hopefully get his grandmother a real home. Unfortunatly for Danny a scam artist tricks his grandmother into buying a satilite with hi tuition money and Danny faces being kicked out of school if he can't come up with 5,000.00 by the end of the month. Desperate, Danny takes the advice of his scam artist Jainitor friend, Jerry and fakes a slip and fall on school grounds in order to sue the school and get his tuition. Before he knows it Danny i caught up in a whirlwind of maddness as he meets Jerry's group of friends, each crazier then the last and even finds love along the way..But Danny's rival Dean Dickman isn't about to give up the school's money and let Danny get away with his scheme and Dickman, (who's also a veteran lawywer) is a worthy apponet

While not exactly laugh out loud funny most of the time, Slip And Fall is an endearing and loveable little film chock full of intiricate and fun characters, it relies on the absurd situations and the lost, nieve main character's reaction to a crazy situation to carry it through it's running time rather then cheap laughs and it succedes with flying colors.

The character of Jimm o'malley, the obnoxious, vulgar physical tharipist/ wannbe lawyer really steals the show here, coming across as an older, crazier stiffler and really complimenting Danny's shy shakey nature by being his polar oppisite. The discomfort that Danny showcases in his scenes with Jimmy is palatable and really believable.

In fact all the characters here were great, from Danny's  sweet slightly off grandmother who worked wonderfully for showing Danny's softer, more caring side, To Henryka his crazy Russian girlfriend who illustrated that while smart Danny is still very human and subject to be manipulated through lust.  Dean Dickman also worked as a wonderful villain, truly capturing the subtle evil that can grow inside of  someone who's been given too much power and revere. I'd be remiss to not mention Jerry, his misguided mentor who takes up the role of tempter and does a great job at simultaneously standing in a Danny's absent father figure (danny's dad i deceased) and the proverbial devil on the shoulder or Danny's love interest, the likewise shy and trapped by circumstance secretary to Jimmy, who really completes Danny and helps to wrap up the story nicely.

While there is some vulgar humor with the scenes with Jimmy and a handful of others, it's subtle and not in your face or revolting like the humor you'll find in most comedies today and the film didn't rely on dicks, tits or farts to carry it which is sure to be refreshing for those of us who are growing bored with sophomoric humor being the only thing available.

The story itself is surprisingly engaging and heartwarming. You can't help but identify with what Danny is going through and root for him despite the fact that he's  found himself on the wrong side of the law, his attitude towards the whole thing somehow saves him from being a villan himself.

...I give this film no middle fingers up, it works equally as well as a comedy and a character drama  and i recommend it for anyone who's looking for comedy that makes you think a bit and doesn't make you want to throw up.

5851379,4,B00DRQETHY,"They say comedy is the most difficult film to produce. Jason Loomis succeeded in writing
a memorable and truly funny comedy.

I came across this film while researching an actor I was considering for my own film.
To be honest the thought of a independent comedy with two names actors (William Forsythe & Andrew Divoff)
who are not known for comedy did not show me much promise. Well, to say I was surprised was an understatement.

Loomis succeeded in writing a very funny script. Marc Colucci appeared to do great as Director.
And the no-name cast nailed it. Sam Cohan did a wonderful job as the Danny. A poor college kid
who always wants to do the right thing but seems to get beat at every turn. Zofia Gozynska gives
a great performance as Danny's venomous girl friend Henryka.

The crazy thing about ""Slip & Fall"" is that it is very difficult to categorize. Parts are harmless comedy.
Other parts are pretty raunchy to say the least. Case in point is William DeCoff who plays Jimmy O'Malley
Danny's attorney. DeCoff is hysterically funny with a monologue that is peppered with more F bombs than
all the seasons of ""the sopranos"" combined. But it was like poetry. And Alyssa Jayne Hale plays the funniest
bimbo type character I've seen in any movie.

The rest of the supporting cast held up there ends well. William Forsythe as always delivers. Andrew Divoff
was creepy as hell as Dean Dickman.

I recommend it highly as it does not take itself to serious. It is raunchy. But very fun.
It will be interesting to see which one of the no-name
actors break out in the coming years. I could see Zofia Gozynska or Alyssa Jane Hale in prime time comedy.
I saw DeCoff seems to do okay in TV. Being in a bunch of TV pilots. I could see Sam Cohan in TV also.",1379894400,,1750,4.4733542319749215

5851381,4,B00DRQETHY,"I honestly went into watching this movie thinking it would be another college parody with the same old comedy catch phrases I have heard way too many times already.  I was very surprised at well the story was written and actually had a fresh take on the problems of your average college student.  The entire cast was likeable and and it was very easy to get drawn in to each one and relate to them.

Today's movies are being pushed out so fast to make a dollar, it was nice to see a more laid back movie I didn't need to watch a second time to understand the hidden meaning.  I highly recommend watching this",1378080000,,608,4.260869565217392

8596739,1,B00DRQETHY,"Not sure how anyone saw this as funny or innovative or anything except repetitive.  Yes, there was a little good acting which is why it is getting a review at all and a star,. but how many times did we really need to hear the Dean call the guy that name?  How many examples of his sexual prowess or lack thereof did we need to hear from the lawyer and in such great detail?  I could go on but suffice it to say this movie could have been done in less than half the time if the directors etal knew when to shift to other character development or story.  Maybe that was the whole problem though.  A one trick pony so there was no place to shift attention.
I saw a positive review on the movie by someone that said it was refreshing not  to see the same old sexual connotations in  comedy.  So apparently dropping the bar further is considered refreshing?  Someone called it a positive that there were few fart jokes.  Apparently it is the height of humor these days to eschew those in favor and obscenity laced diatribes on everything else from homophobia to juvenile name calling by supposed distinguished men of law.
I do get it.  The intent was to slander as many angles as possible so the main character to commit fraud and still appear as the good guy.  It's just a shame the writers, producers, actors, director weren't up to the task of doing that with something above 5th grade creativity.
