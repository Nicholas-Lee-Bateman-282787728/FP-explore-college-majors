4460223,5,B004RBC5H4,"I purchased this dvd for Off Limits;; not for Gordons war.  Off Limits is beyond words as it is ACTION, ACTION, ACTION, from start to finish.  This is the best of all the Vietnam movies;  better than Platoon, the Deer Hunter, Apacalypse Now, Rambo, Missing In Action, and especially Full Metal Jacket.  The cast is fantastic, the movie plot is fantastic, the action never stops and the music is OUTASIGHT!!!!  Off limits shows us what FUBAR and SNAFU means.  Off limits is not the usual war movie but takes us through a Criminal Investigation Detachment (CID) mystery.  For those of us who were a part of that conflict, Off Limits tells it like it was",1354320000,2,651,4.608695652173913
4460224,4,B004RBC5H4,"Plenty of action at its best, Set in Vietnam in the war era and there was plenty of talent, Young girl murdered and by whom, Well I know and I'm not telling as to spoil a great movie. It's a bit of this and that with suspense and mind curiosity, as to who done it. Wonderful story line and in depth motions, worth seeing and with the crunchies by your side. I rated this movie an A grade for being different.",1342828800,,408,4.049382716049383
4460225,3,B004RBC5H4,"I have seen the movie, 'Off Limits"" probably 10 times since it's release, but I didn't own it until just recently when I purchased it as part of a ""Double Feature"" from Amazon.com. The movie is great, as usual, except I notice that a few parts,(scenes), of the movie are missing. I understand, now, why the price is right to own this movie. I assume it was shortened to fit the DVD.
  I don't remember the movie being advertised as being cut. When I purchase a movie, I expect it to be the ""ENTIRE"" movie. I am disapointed, but I will be careful in the future.
  I got fooled once, but it won't happen again.",1324425600,5,608,4.260869565217392
4460226,3,B004RBC5H4,"Judge Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict -- ""With only a few minutes allocated to setting up the story, Gordon's War gets into top gear practically from the off, as Gordon (Paul Winfield) and his crew tackle the drug peddling scum of Harlem corner by corner. It doesn't matter that Gordon is able to set up his operation with little in the way of available resources; the viewer is simply asked to just accept that he has a kickass command post with all kinds of surveillance kit ready to go. The film is hardly an original work, but succeeds by virtue of the craftsmanship that has gone into the film. Victor J. Kemper's cinematography lends the film a gritty aesthetic that in many ways helps paper over the screenplays lack of depth. Likewise, the cast, particularly Paul and Gilbert Lewis, deliver authentic performances that never leave the viewer in any doubt as to how badass these guys are. If Off Limits shares any similarity with Gordon's War, its in the lackluster and rather formulaic plot. Set against the backdrop of war, and dealing with a race-related series of murders, Off Limits has much potential, but not once does it use its setting to its advantage. Rather, writer/director Christopher Crowe (Last of the Mohicans) seems content to put the emphasis on the performances of his cast.  Gregory Hines and Willem Dafoe prove a good combination, but stealing the film from under their noses is Scott Glenn (Sucker Punch), as an out-of-his-mind suspect. His role may be small, but it is memorable for Glenn's near-psychotic reading of the role. Also offering more than able support is Fred Ward (Tremors). These actors do well to keep the viewers attention away from the repetitive plot. Both films are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic transfers. Gordon's War is generally good, taking into account the film's age and budget. There's a mild level of grain, and occasional signs of damage. Otherwise it's reasonably sharp, with natural colors and good black levels. Off Limits shows signs of damage, with grain and lack of fine detail evident throughout. Each film comes with a commentary track, the first features cinematographer Victor J. Kemper and actor Tony King, who make a surprisingly good combination. The second featuring director Crowe and Dafoe. Also included are a selection of trailers and TV spots.""",1310515200,7,2320,4.979381443298969

4460276,5,B004RBC5H4,"Over the years I have had about 2 or 3  (including tv) copies of  Gordon's War. None were in the absolute picture quality I had sought to keep as the pride of my DVD movie library. Finally, this official release has given this movie, Gordon's War the respected picture quality it's original theatrical release had shown us. Gilbert Lewis (remember him as vice lord, Richard Ward's lieutenant and assassin in ""Across 110th Street"") as the ruthless gang lord drug dealer plays the part with such believable realism. Off Limits was not my particular choice in making this purchase, but nevertheless, found it to be quite a thriller as an added bonus feature. My thanks to this studio for giving us Gordon's War in great enjoyable picture quality. Five Stars all the way!",1397088000,,767,4.803030303030303

8438863,5,B004RBC5H4,"I bought this double feature in order to get Off Limits but enjoyed Gordon's War as well. Gordon's War is a rather simple early 70's movie where Capt. Gordon comes home from Viet Nam as a Green Beret when his wife dies of a heroine overdose. Seeing the way Harlem has deteriorated from drugs invading every part of life he gathers his old former soldiers together to take their area back from the drug dealers. It's no academy award winner but a dated good versus evil movie that makes you root for the good guys.  Off Limits is one of my favorite Viet Nam war offshoot movies. Like Good Morning Viet Nam this movies takes place in Viet Nam during the war and soldiers are the main characters but it is not a soldiers in combat movie. In Off Limits Willem Defoe and Gregory Hines play military police in the CID who become involved in an investigation of Vietnamese prostitutes being murdered , and the murderer is believed to be one of five Colonels in their area of operation, making it very difficult and dangerous to proceed with the investigation. This is all interwoven with a adversarial working relationship with the South Vietnamese  military police, and that the one living witness is now living and working with the Viet Cong. If you like Willem Defoe, Gregory Hines or Viet Nam war movies you'll like this one.",1517270400,,1322,4.5974576271186445

8438868,3,B004RBC5H4,"I've been looking for a copy of ""Off Limits"" for years. Literally. I've found it off and on, but always it's been ridiculous prices or not at all. The copy isn't bad at all. It looked just fine on a high def screen.
The problem is, as far as I can remember, at least a couple of songs and possibly a couple of scenes, are missing. It's a little annoying. I hope I'm wrong about this.
The shortcomings aren't bad enough that we're thinking about returning it. It took too long to find it. And it's one of the few war movies we both like. If I'm wrong I will happily retract this statement.
As for Gordon's War, I can't say.
The bonus features? Gordon has none. Off Limits has a commentary track with the director and Mr. Defoe. I haven't listened, so I can't tell you anything about them. So many have been such disappointments that I've given upon them. If Mr. Hines had been there I would have, out of sentiment. I guess I'll have to go ahead and get a copy of Tap for that.",1488672000,,975,4.191489361702128
