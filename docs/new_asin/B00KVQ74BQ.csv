6451606,4,B00KVQ74BQ,"Im embarrassed to say that I was not aware of this 1945 noir film (the kind where the innocent guy gets mixed up with a woman and finds himself charged with murder he didn't commit). When I mentioned to friends who are film buffs, they looked at me quizzically. But now Ive joined the club.

I cant say I LOVED the film because it really is low budget with many of the driving sequences filmed in a studio with a back screen. And it ends more like a shaggy dog story which disappointed me. But thats a subjective opinion and it sure has all the characters of film noir.  It also has music. The song Im Always Chasing Rainbows is sung or played no less than four times during the brief 67 minute running time.

But, my guess is most folks who will search for a review of this new 2014 release by Film Chest will want to know: How good is the print?. Look at the reviews of all the prior releases and you will see lots of complains of other versions of the film. They are either scratched or hazy looking. Well, I can tell you that this one is pretty darned good. No, there are not sharp black and white images but the grays are darker and the contrast pretty good. So obviously Film Chest had a decent master copy. There are some scratches near the beginning but that is acceptable. The sound is not high-fi but the all the words  and music come through clearly.
I think those who want a nice watchable copy will be happy with this.

There are 6 chapter stops and no bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8661967,1,B00KVQ74BQ,"Folks, remember to name the studio that produced the DVD in your comment because Amazon lumps all reviews together under the title, not the version. That said, I purchased the Alpha and the Film Chest versions of this film. Don't even bother with Film Chest. Terrible transfer. Alpha (surprisingly) was much, much better.",1458432000,4,321,5.0754716981132075
8661968,2,B00KVQ74BQ,"Detour, 1945 film

The film opens on a lonely two-lane blacktop highway. Its geography suggests southern California. A man walks along the highway until he gets a ride. The juke box plays a big record, the tune brings back memories. We see what happened before to Al the piano player. A long distance call is handled by dozens of operators. Al hitchhikes across country to Los Angeles. One man, Charles Haskell, picks him up and tells about his past life. Then something goes terribly wrong. Al switches clothes and takes Haskell's identification, then drives to California. Al picks up a woman by a gas station, Vera is going to Los Angeles. Later there is a surprise from Vera! She is trouble.

Vera and Al register as Mr. & Mrs. Charles Haskell. ""I'm always right."" Their conversation tells about their characters. They don't sell the car. They dine at a drive-in diner. Vera has big ideas. The monetary figures date this film. An argument results in more bad luck for Al. He leaves, but an unforeseen event occurs to end this story.

A better script could improve this low-budget story. The idea of impersonation of a stranger was used in other films and stories. If Vera was thrown out of Haskell's automobile why would she return to it? It does teach of the problems that come from making a wrong decision (picking up a stranger hitchhiker).",1443052800,,1347,4.723404255319149

8661970,4,B00KVQ74BQ,"Many previous reviewers appear to be as concerned with the quality of ""Detour's"" video as with the story itself. This reviewer can report that his copy was fine. There must be a few versions of the DVD out there.

The plot line here is basic: Tom Neal's nice girl friend moves to LA. He misses her-but somehow decides to hitchhike to her. People must have still thumbed rides back then. Hitching is where his troubles begin.  A wealthy guy named Haskell picks him up-and then dies suddenly. TN is afraid of the cops, though it is unclear why. He hides the body, takes Haskell's fancy car-and then picks up a girl hitch hiker! This is the ""detour""! This is also where ""things get complicated"". Suffice to say that the young lady (Ann Savage) is not the girl next door. She is also not exactly a stranger to the late Mr. Haskell. This review will stop here to avoid any giveaways.

""Detour"" certainly keeps the action flowing in a tidy 67 minute run time. Viewers may have to disregard a couple of plot implausibilities but this is a safe choice for noir fans. The recommendation from this observer is to give ""Detour"" a try.",1426550400,,1123,4.522167487684729
8661971,4,B00KVQ74BQ,"Detour has been one of my favorite films, and my favorite film noir, since I first had the chance to see it on the old late-night movie show out of Buffalo in the late 80s/early 90s. Can't recall the show's title, but they all acted like hep cats. A cool show that introduced me to a lot of out there stuff.

Unfortunately, being a Public Domain film, the various versions that are out there have left much to be desired, and its PD status has stopped many DVD companies from putting in the time and effort to restore this masterpiece of film noir.

I am pleased to report that Film Chest's release of DETOUR (1945) is the best one yet. Dialog is crisper and clearer than in any previous release. And the picture is a revelation.  I really don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they criticize this release.  I've owned every DVD version of DETOUR and the only one that comes close to this release is the Roan version.

The only thing that would make this even better is a full length commentary from a film historian.

Highly recommended upgrade.",1421971200,6,1063,4.481865284974093
8661972,1,B00KVQ74BQ,Very disappointed. They have a lot of nerve calling it digitally restored. It looks like a third generation video tape with washed out images and poor audio. Avoid at any price!,1419206400,6,177,4.741935483870968
8661973,1,B00KVQ74BQ,"In my opinion the best film noir ever made! One star is for this digitally restored version by Film Chest. Looks like watching through a piece of plastic, out of focus. The movie deserves six stars. I like this move so much I doubled dipped for this so called improved version, it's worse. The best version to date is still on the Mill Creek Mystery Classics 50 (movie) pack' and it is a very decent copy. If you like film noir or 1940 and 50 mystery movies, don't miss DETOUR! It's one of the best.",1416355200,6,499,4.2631578947368425
8661974,4,B00KVQ74BQ,"The best edition available of this classic noir film.  But it is far from perfect.  The picture is quite clean, the blacks are rich, contrast is very good, and the sound is decent.  However, the image is also quite fuzzy -- almost looks out of focus.  Unfortunately, probably the best we are going to get as even the original negatives contain the above qualities.  Negatives can be cleaned up, but not made clear if they weren't made that way from the beginning.  Still, if you love this film, this is the best edition we are likely to get.",1412380800,12,541,4.469387755102041
