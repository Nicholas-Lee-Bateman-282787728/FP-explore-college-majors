3964422,5,B002PDBBGC,If you are looking for a funny laugh out loud movie this will keep you entertained. We rented a couple of nights ago. Great movie spoof. Wayans brothers are hard to beat.,1403568000,2,170,4.34375
3964423,2,B002PDBBGC,"Most of the laughs are in the first 30 minutes.  After that it's the same old tired cliches of dance challenges, teen parenthood, interracial friendship slash romance, a fat suit, bizarre teachers, and token white kids in a 90% black high school.  It's not that I don't like the Wayans brothers.  They were great in ""Don't Be A Menace"" and ""White Chicks"" but lack fresh physical comedy here.",1370304000,,391,4.720588235294118
3964424,3,B002PDBBGC,"CAME IN ON TIME, THERE  WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DELIVERY OR WITH THE CONDITION, THIS WAS A MOVIE ORDERED BY MY EX USING MY ACCOUNT AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY WANTED IT WAS STILL SENT WITH SPECTACULAR TIME AND GREAT CONDITION!

3964429,5,B002PDBBGC,"This was some kind of flick that will have you laughing till you drop. That scene with the pregnant woman and then the baby comes out like he or she had it all going on. Wow! love the trailer, cannot wait to see the movie.",1253232000,,222,3.9555555555555557
8376900,3,B002PDBBGC,It's everything you'd expect from a Wayans brothers movie. DW Jr. looks SO much like his pops. Good stuff. Now I'm in the mood for White Chicks.,1523404800,,144,4.37037037037037
8376901,5,B002PDBBGC,"Wayans Brothers are hysterical.  A spoof a minute with so many clever laugh out loud lines and references to every dance musical made including Hair Spray, Flash Dance, Save the Last Dance, Fame and more. Eg,that silly song from Fame spoofed to ""I'm gonna  love men forever.""
Great acting and so many laughs.  Enjoy, we all need a laugh.",1513209600,,337,4.677966101694915
