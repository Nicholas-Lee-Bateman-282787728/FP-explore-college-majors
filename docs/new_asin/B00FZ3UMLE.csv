6040889,5,B00FZ3UMLE,"This DVD is an excellent compliment to the book Taekwondo Black Belt Poomsae Original Koryo and Koryo by Richard Chun and Doug Cook.  The DVD is an excellent visual aid to learning both Original Koryo and Koryo Poomsae.  Master Doug Cook and Master Fred Kouefati demonstrate both forms under the watchful eye of Grandmaster Richard Chun.  Both Master Cook and Master Kouefati show tremendous humility and respect towards Grand Master Chun, and while performing both poomsae.  This DVD expresses Grand Master Chun's, Master Cook's, and Master Kouefati's tireless efforts in producing a visual aid for learning Original Koryo and Koryo poomsae.  Thus showing that these monumental taekwondo forms are to be cherished and not forgotten.

It compliments the book; having the book and DVD offers a perfect balance.
You get to view every motion including chambers; the descriptions for each technique are clear and easy to understand.
You have read their books now watch the words go into action, step by step, learn with Grand Master Chun and Master Cook as they explain and demonstrate the individual stances, blocks, strikes and kicks in great detail. It is very easy to follow, the DVD teaches at a learning pace not too fast and not too slow while learning poomsae Koryo and Origianl Koryo. Great for all ages.",1390176000,,833,4.597315436241611
6040891,4,B00FZ3UMLE,"I received this DVD a few days ago and could hardly wait to watch it. This DVD, while a separate purchase, is a must-have accessory to the book of a similar name - Tae Kwon Do Black Belt Poomsae: Koryo and Original Koryo (my review of the book is also posted here on Amazon), also by Grandmaster Richard Chun and Master Doug Cook. My nine-year-old son, who will test for his Dan Bo black belt in May, watched most of the DVD with me. We both enjoyed the material on the DVD.

Like the book, this DVD is intended for viewers of all ages, even those unfamiliar with the art of Taekwondo, although Taekwondo practitioners of all ranks are likely to benefit the most due to their interest and study of the art. Of course, viewers without any experience will also benefit by this introduction to the art and some of its techniques, not to mention the Koryo pattern, performed by more 1st dan black belts around the world than any other pattern (according to the DVD). The DVD begins by answering the the questions ""What is Taekwondo?"" and ""What is Taekwondo Poomsae?"", followed by historical information about the art and Original Koryo and Koryo. As one might expect, this information is much more complete and thorough in the book than on the DVD, due to constraints of the DVD, i.e. focus on the instruction and performance of the techniques and patterns. The introductory and historical information on the DVD, however, never feels haphazard or truncated in any way, with just enough information in just the right amount for viewers to gain a sense of perspective to better appreciate the technical instruction of the DVD.

Following the introduction, Master Cook and Grandmaster Chun explain and demonstrate the individual stances, blocks, strikes and kicks in detail. Although proficient black belts who have learned Koryo correctly will have already learned these elements as they apply to that pattern, it is nonetheless useful to understand how others teach the same material and either confirm your understanding of the material or discover a new perspective or method. This was my experience with the stances, blocks, strikes and kicks in Koryo in regards to this DVD. For my son, who has not yet learned Koryo, he was excited to learn more about the pattern from the DVD.

Neither my son nor I were familiar with Original Koryo, so the instruction regarding its techniques were interesting for both of us. Having been in Taekwondo since I was twelve, I am familiar with all the individual techniques of Original Koryo, some of which are not used or taught in the Taegeuk color belt patterns. In contrast, my son who is not familiar with the techniques, learned new material he might not have learned otherwise at a WTF sport Taekwondo facility. One technique in particular that stands out is the four-knuckle punch. This was new to him, and I have not seen it for many years (admittedly, I was out of the art for nearly 15 years).

Before I get too far along in this review, I need to mention the third talent in the video, Master Fred Kouefati. Like Master Cook, Master Kouefati is a long-time student of Grandmaster Chun, approximately 30 years, I believe the video explained. Master Kouefati helps Master Cook demonstrate the techniques for both Original Koryo and Koryo. Master Kouefati performs Original Koryo for the DVD, while Master Cook performs Koryo. The DVD benefits from Master Kouefati's contribution.

Once the individual techniques are explained, Original Koryo and Koryo are demonstrated by Master Kouefati and Master Cook at slow speed, presumably so viewers can more easily follow along and perform the patterns with the DVD, and at normal speed as they should be performed. Both patterns are filmed from the front, side and rear views, to be comprehensive.

An important contribution to this DVD are the combat applications of select sequences from both Original Koryo and Koryo. Grandmaster Chun, Master Cook and Master Kouefati explain and demonstrate four applications from each pattern. These applications help clarify how the techniques should be performed in the patterns, if the patterns are to be performed realistically. A particularly welcome application from Koryo is the knee-break from the 12th position. I have seen many modern black belts perform this technique improperly due to a lack of understanding of the technique.

It is a true pleasure to see Grandmaster Chun and Master Cook on this DVD. Both are well-known in the Taekwondo community. Grandmaster Chun, in particular, is legendary. My first instructor had Grandmaster Chun's books from 1976 (Tae Kwon Do: The Korean Martial Art) and 1983 (Advancing in Tae Kwon DO) on his shelf, along with his books about Moo Duk Kwan. It is rewarding to both see and hear Grandmaster Chun on the DVD, as I am not likely to get any other chance to do so. I believe this is the first time Grandmaster Chun has appeared in video on a DVD.",1384992000,,4923,4.881578947368421

8619664,4,B00FZ3UMLE,This is a great book on Koryo forms. Good explanations and good phots.,1502668800,,70,4.461538461538462
8619665,2,B00FZ3UMLE,"Disappointed all around, pitiful video, Cook can barely raise his legs above stomach level, pitiful explanations, they should've paid a tkd forms expert to perform Koryo",1414972800,,169,5.538461538461538
8619666,4,B00FZ3UMLE,I like it . This DVD helps me practice Martial art again when I was Tae Kwon Do instructor 40 years ago.,1414540800,,104,3.772727272727273
8619667,5,B00FZ3UMLE,Excellent source for Koryo and preserving Original Koryo for Traditional Taekwondo's inheritance . Grand Master Chun and Master Cook have tested a wonderful resource for all who practice Traditional Taekwondo.,1393027200,,209,6.0
8619668,3,B00FZ3UMLE,"To start: As a resource to preserve the Old Koryo Poomse and refresh our minds / learn the modern Koryo poomse this is a good DVD.

I own GM Chun's ""Tae Kwon Do: The Korean Martial Art"" and I believe that it is a valuable resource and well written book so when I was searching for practical applications of the Koryo pattern and the youtube video ad from YMAA popped up, I was sold on the 2.5 minute video which demonstrated the pattern and a few sections of practical applications.

[Recommendations]
 Buy this if you want to learn and practice the Old Koryo form.  Do not buy it for any other resources.
 If you do buy this buy only the DVD or the Book but not both.  I would say the DVD is probably better because you can see things moving.
 If you want to better understand Poomse and what their mnemonics mean, look into Iain Abernethy.  His practicalkatabunkai account on Youtube and his books transcend just Karate. TKD and Karate share many similarities due to The Occupation and it isn't a stretch to connect the dots on a lot of moves and derive your own more practical opinions from the information he conveys.

[What I liked]
 The patterns are well demonstrated by Master Kouefeti in section 3.
 Grandmaster Chun corrects and more thoroughly explains the content on the go and demonstrates some techniques.
 Section 2 covers all the basics (stances, blocks, punches and kicks that are used in the 2 Poomse) you need to know.
 Grandmaster Chun sincerely wants to preserve the knowledge of these Poomse.

[What I disliked]
 Master Cooks historical explanations appear to fall along what a lot of historians think as Revisionist.  Tae Kwon Do is not as old as a lot of Masters try to convey and his reasoning for practicing Poomse appear questionable.
 The historical section is longer than it needs to be on an instructional DVD and its relevance to the subject is lacking in depth and direction.
 The practical applications portion of the DVD is approximately 5 minutes long and I believe it demonstrates the lack of practical knowledge being taught by many mainstream modern masters of TKD.  If you try some of the moves as they are demonstrated they feel uncomfortable and wrong.
 The DVD is 1:27:50 in length approximately and based off the advertisement I feel it doesnt live up to the hype.
 The extra features of the DVD are advertisements along the same vein to hook you into other products.

I am a 25 year practitioner and Kukkiwon certified Black Belt. I recently started practicing other martial arts to better understand TKD and my journey is currently in practical form understanding and my focus is on self-defense not sport sparring.",1391644800,3,2659,4.72234273318872
8619669,5,B00FZ3UMLE,This is a great video that anyone who is a black belt or pursuing a black belt should have. Master Cook and Grand Master Chun provide very detailed and easy to follow instructions that can serve as a reference guide to students seeking to further refine their skills. The book also helps outline both forms and their execution. A great buy!,1390780800,,340,4.590163934426229
8619670,5,B00FZ3UMLE,"Koryo is considered the most performed and popular black belt poomsae in the world. So why have a DVD? Grand Master Chun and Master Cook provide details of each technique and sequence as well as several views of the performance of Koryo. The same details are provided for Original Koryo the ancestral poomsae, an often overlooked and forgotten poomsae, which Grandmaster Chun has chosen to bring forth as a tribute to traditional Taekwondo. As a bonus a brief history is included this enriches ones understanding of the Koroyos. This DVD is meant to compliment the book of the same title, which it most certainly does, having a visual interpretation enhances the learning and training experience whether you're learning or revisiting Koryo.",1390694400,,740,5.12396694214876
8619671,5,B00FZ3UMLE,"This video and book needs to be part of every black belt's library no matter their dan level. All martial artists are trained to spar, however, true proficiency of martial action is measured in poomsae execution. The video gives a most comprehensive rendering of both Original Koryo and Koryo poomsae by one of the highest ranked taekwondo masters in the world, Grand Master R. Chun, and his worthy disciples Master D. Cook and Master Kouefati, Together they set also a high standard in poomsae execution by explaining the importance of purpose in defending one's practice from the pitfalls of uncorrected habits. The practical application of poomsae are made manifest by revealing some of the ""invisible opponents"" coming from different directions. If enriching your practice is your purpose, then put this video and its accompanying book in your basket.",1390348800,2,855,5.202898550724638
8619672,5,B00FZ3UMLE,This book and DVD are a must have for any martial art enthusiast. It is clear and consise information.  We are so lucky to have the world renown Grandmaster Chun still here to share his knowledge and expertise. Thank you Master Cook and Grandmaster Chun for this invaluable book and DVD.,1390262400,,287,4.627450980392157
