5254625,5,B0093DFMJ4,"The Place Beyond the Pines is an ambitious epic about choices and the consequences of those choices, and about the relationship between fathers and sons along with how the father's decisions impact their sons.

The film's first act opens with Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) a famous motorcycle rider for a traveling state carnival. The man leads an empty life without any meaning besides his job and bike. That changes when Romina (Eva Mendes) an old fling returns comes to see him after a year. It turns out that Luke has a son, Jason who he had no knowledge of and has no part in his son's life. He's forced to watch as another man raise and be a part of his baptism. Luke wants to be a part of his son's life saying a son needs his father after all Luke didn't have a father and look how badly he turned out, but as it is pointed out to him by a few people he has a limited skill set so if he can barely take care of himself how can he take care of Romina and their son.

Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) stars in the second act. Avery a rookie police officer who's been on the job barely a year when he becomes a hero after he successfully takes down Luke Glanton on his own. Avery is a very ambitious man wanting to rise to the highest level of office, and he pays the price for it when he gets involved with officer Deluca (Ray Liotta) and his fellow corrupt cops. Avery already has a guilty conscience about taking Jason's father away from him, so much so that Avery can barely look at his own son, AJ when he is forced to make a moral decision does he continue to help Deluca or does he try and bring them down all the while trying to advance his own career. Avery's and Luke's lives and decisions truly come together in the third act of the film which takes place fifteen years in the future. There Avery is running for Attorney General, AJ (Emory Cohen) is living with his divorced wife Jennifer (Rose Byrne). The troubled AJ moves in with his dad and into a new high school. There he meets a teenager at the same age in Jason (Dane DeHaan), and the impact of the choices their parents made come to light and they are left to deal with the consequences. The film ends just like it began with a young man getting on a bike and riding off into the unknown.

Derek Cianfrance's screenplay is elaborate and far reaching in the scope of the characters, but it doesn't always work effectively. In my opinion Avery's story is the most flawed of the three intertwined stories. Avery just isn't that well written of a character or he isn't fleshed out enough, and Bradley Cooper who's proven he's capable of being a great actor from his Oscar nominated performance in Silver Linings Playbook instead seems to be playing the character without any depth. Even his emotional scenes just don't hold up that well. Along with that the supporting actor's roles weren't that good. Whether it be the capable Ray Liotta and Rose Byrne or Bruce Greenwood it just seems like Cianfrance was trying to do too much with the story he had. What holds up the lackluster middle part of the film are the beginning and end of the film. Ryan Gosling has come into his own in his last few films, and outside of Gangster Squad he has given outstanding performances. Ryan delivers beautifully acted performance as he perfectly plays Luke the sadden knew father who finds hope in his son, and all he wants to do is provide for the woman he loves and his son even if it is illegal. Eva Mendes delivers her best acting performance of her career as Romina who feels guilt for not telling Luke about his son as well as conflicted emotions about his father. In a supporting role Ben Mendelsohn does a wonderful job as Robin, Luke's only friend. I think Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen steal the film with their performances as Jason and AJ respectfully. They did a masterful job displaying emotions of these emotionally damaged teenagers. You will fully believe in these characters and the scars they display in their eyes. The script isn't outstanding, but I loved it. It does a wonderful job showing the impact fathers have on their son's and how our decisions in life always have consequences whether we see them right away or not.

Derek Cianfrance's script might not be the best, but he makes up for it as a director. Admittedly I haven't seen any of his other films, but this relative new comer does a marvelous job bring to life his vision for The Place Beyond the Pines. Cianfrance nearly perfectly directs his outstanding cast as they almost all give superb performances helping to add depth and character to his film. Beyond the Pines is simply a gorgeous film as it was filmed entirely in New York State and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt captures the essence of the state perfectly from the cities to the great pine forests. I wouldn't call Mike Patton a great or good composer from the list of projects he's worked on, but Patton does an excellent job with the score. The tone, feel and emotion of the music fit perfectly with scenes in the film. The only flaws I found in the production of the film were perhaps in the camera work being jittery and hard to follow on occasion and some of the editing decisions. Beyond the Pines is a pretty long film, and I'm sure there had to be some editing decisions made about what needed to be cut, and in certain scenes I think it shows. In my opinion those are only very small flaws that didn't take much away from the film.

Going into A Place Beyond the Pines I had high expectations. I loved the trailer, the cast and the music I heard and though the film is flawed in the middle Beyond the Pines brightens up what has been a very disappointing early 2013 in film being easily the best film of the year so far with a great cast, a really good screenplay, great directing, really good acting mixed in with a great score and beautiful cinematography. If there is one film in the early part of 2013 that I think is a must see it is Beyond the Pines, and I think it will go down as one of the better films of the year.",1365206400,19,6028,4.402690582959641

5254635,5,B0093DFMJ4,"I like Derek Cianfrance's films. I'll never forget the impact ""Blue Valentine"" left on me. I had seen films involving failing relationships, but that film was an autopsy of a failed relationship, and it was absolutely heartbreaking the whole way through. I loved it so much that I had to see Cianfrance's take on a bank robbery film. And man, is this film just as amazing, if not more than his previous outing. Not only are the performances stellar in this, but the directions the story goes blew my mind. This is a very ambitious film and it pulls all the right stops, in my personal opinion. It was a beautiful drama that spans two generations and had unexpected moments that stayed with me long after the movie ended. I love it.",1511049600,2,731,4.545454545454546

5254669,5,B0093DFMJ4,"This is a very gritty and suspense filled movie that covers everything from a life of crime, to redemption and tragedy, in two separate time periods, making it almost like two excellent movies in one. The plot is complex and full of emotion, with just enough action to appease those who like action, but it does it interchanged with much real-life drama.

Now, I read the reviews first and almost didn't watch this based on the number of dimwits who gave it one or two stars, with asinine comments like ""Meh"" and ""Sucked"". In this day and age, we can now assume that these reviews are written by a bunch of dull children and/or mentally challenged adults, who only want to see explosions and gunfire through every second of a movie. DO NOT read the bad reviews. I read many of them and I'm 100% convinced these reviews were left by TROLLS, who do nothing but shoot everything down that is good, just to appease their own sense of self-worthlessness.

From now on, let's just focus on the Top Reviews, because the trolls leaving one and two stars, especially for this film, don't have a clue what they are talking about. The TROLLS have ruined the internet.",1489276800,9,1156,4.579710144927536

I used to think Ryan Gosling was very over rated but films like this one as well as Drive completely changed my mind about him. People who call this film depressing are right but that doesn't make it a terrible movie, it just makes it a realistic one. I especially liked the way it showed the mistakes and actions of the fathers which later had an impact on the sons. Bradley Cooper was also amazing in this film but I always liked his past performances like Silver Linings Playbook and American Sniper. If you're a fan of all kinds of films, not just block buster action films, then this film is for you. I highly recommend it.",1485129600,20,777,4.402777777777778

One starring Ryan Gosling which is the better part of the film, and the other part with Bradley Cooper.  Bradley Cooper can't hold a candle to Gosling's acting. Didn't know that before. Thought of them as equals in acting, but put them both in the same film and you can see who shines. Copper is overrated in my opinion in general. Almost anyone can play his part and he won't be missed. Gosling on the other hand just keeps getting better. Bring something to each role that is entirely his own. Such a versatile actor (The Notebook, Lars and the Real Girl, The Place Beyond the Pines), three totally different movies, fantastic in all three. All worth watching.

But I'll never forget the first time I watched this movie because it is one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen. Derek Cianfrance once again proves that he is one of the best filmmakers working today and is able to draw some fantastic performances out of these actors. The movie has a timeless feel to it because of the themes it deals with such as: fatherhood, loss, and relationships. The soundtrack/score is fantastic too. It makes me feel nostalgic every time I hear it and that's a rare thing. The only negative thing is that this movie was completely ignored around Oscar time.

5254744,5,B0093DFMJ4,"This is a great drama that I haven't seen in decades.
I saw the director's other film <BLUE VALENTINE> and it was good too but not like this.
This one is supurb. A top ten of my list.
The ending is unforgettable and will stay in my mind for years.
It's not because of Ryan Gosling or Bradley Cooper or even Eva MEndes or Rose Byrne.
It is the relationship between Dane DeHaan (JASON) and Emory Cohen (AJ) the kid of a cop and the guy who was killed by the cop during the arrest.
The movie is about the Bike rider who happened to be a bank robber and end up dead (Ryan Gosling)'s son and the cop (Bradle Coppperwho killes him )'s son.
When AJ finds out that there is Jason around, he meets him and be his friend. I don't know maybe he needed a friend who knows his father and maybe he felt guilty about his father for the fact that he killed the Jason's father.
Not knowing that AJ's father was the killer of his father, he became AJ's friend.
But little by little, AJ becomes Jason's burden.
When they both got arrested by cops for keeping drugs and all.
AJ's father is a tough to him since he is trying to be a governent in some kind and all and AJ is not all pleased about it. He needed someone like real dad not a famous dude.
When Jason finally found out that AJ's father is the one who killed his father, that becomes a turning point.
Jason's mother is married to another man and all, he even sends a photo that he took from AJ's father's wallet.
His mother cries a little which also touched our mind. We can feel that she still love Ryan Gosling.
Because we saw a lot of moments she spend time with Ryan, we know good moments Eva Mendes(Jason's mom)  spent with Ryan Gosling.
It's just that Ryan is a bomb.

When we see finally that Jason got a bike just like the one his dad has and rides along the road fades away, we kind of feels relieved.
We feel like we saw an epic tale or something.

From the beginning till the end of the film. there is no extreme moment or anything in this film but the story itself is just well tigtened up and there is no place to trim at all.

You will enjoy every charactor and fall in love with them all.

There is no bad guy good guy in this film but all just understandable.
This is a film that you will just have to watch again and again.

Also this director will be a great one in the future for sure.",1464912000,,2343,4.071583514099783

The film is both a cautionary tale of fatherhood and a generational trip down the road of ""sins of the fathers"" The acting is outstanding. The story drives ahead with power and layered storytelling and you are drawn into the characters. It isn't until the 2nd act when the story shifts to the sons of the Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper characters that the movie finds its true core. It is powerful and tragic at the same time and at times all too real. The ending was terrific and I found myself thinking about it long after and plan on seeing it again.",1445990400,,752,4.378571428571429
5254805,5,B0093DFMJ4,"This is not an action film, or a thriller. This is a slow-burn drama with some interesting plot twists, solid script and rather good acting.

The first story is about the character Luke, played by Ryan Gosling. Luke, at the start of the film, is employed as a carnival daredevil motorcycle rider. The opening of the film starts with Luke in his trailer. The camera follows him as he walks out, through the carnival grounds, to where he performs. This is very well shot, and a great way to start the film. I was quickly impressed. The cinematography in general is quite good.

For reasons I won't get into,Luke decides to quit the traveling carnival and try to settle in the city of Schenectady, NY. He needs money, so he starts robbing banks.

The second story is about Bradley Cooper's character, Avery, who is a rookie cop. Avery and Luke have an altercation that changes both their lives. Time passes. The focus shifts from Luke to Avery, who deals with police corruption, and eventually, since he has a law degree, manages to become an Assistant District Attorney.

The last part of the film takes place 15 years later. Avery is running for Attorney General. The story is not only about Avery, but his son, and the results of what happened 15 years previously.

All the performances are good to very good. Gosling, as Luke, doesn't say much, but still manages to convey a lot of emotion. Cooper is well-cast as Avery. All the other cast members, including Eva Mendes and Ray Liotta,  are well-suited for their roles and help make this film work.

I'm not sure why this movie is negatively reviewed. It is a somber, brooding film, and it is slow, but it is certainly worth watching, if you are in the mood for it.",1445904000,,1716,4.588235294117647

In his follow up, the director makes a film that is ambitious both in scale and scope. A story about a motorcycle stunt rider, who learns that a one night stand resulted in a child with former lover Eva Mendes. He feels he needs to take care of the child and tries to do it by robbing banks.
On the other side of the law is a morally upright rookie cop who has ambitions (Bradley Cooper)
These characters are destined for a clash that will affect their children as well. The two actors are amazing - and neither do they they occupy every scene but they leave a mark.

Gosling is so good at meshing sensitivity, strength, humor, and a certain rage that sits just beneath the surface. Ray Liotta did a nice job with his role as well. He's sleazy and grotesque in a way. From the moment he's introduced into the story you want him to go down and when he does you can't help but feel happy about it. The young actors in the film did a really great job as well.

That being said the movie lacks an obvious motive behind it which may leave soime movie goers bored or confused on the direction. I understand where they are going with it but some might be scratching their heads.

Yes the movie has some violence in it, and some tension regarding crime and police corruption, but I think you can handle it as this movie is really about intergenerational violence, patterns of behavior that move from parents to children, and the sloooowwwwww work of healing.

5254895,2,B0093DFMJ4,"The artistry of this movie was pretty decent, what dragged it down was the tone, and dismal subject matter. It also was one of those movies that had a plot structure that left it nothing to do but increase the body count as time went on in order to achieve intensity and resolution, which is never a good thing. It's not good because the shock value and meaning behind the violence wears off. Movies like this need to learn to back off somewhat, and regain some sensitivity, and they would be so much more powerful. It is kind of tough to have a murder in a movie because then you need to match its intensity throughout the rest of the movie, and the fitting revenge for one murder is another. Soon you have a Shakespearian body count and the audience is desensitized and blas towards any more murders. The intensity is cranked up too high, and another killing seems like a cheap way to increase the intensity and maintain the plot line. Anyways, I liked the beginning premise, with Ryan Gosling as a dirt bike rider, but the interest and verve slipped away. I don't think it's giving too much away to say that the story changes perspectives several times, and that is kind of interesting, but doesn't necessarily work. The movie premise was ok, but like I said, I think its fatal flaw is that it slips into melodrama, and slightly unrealistic situations. The best acting job in this movie was done by Emory Cohen, who turns in a great performance as a troubled young thug. The artistry of the director and the actors was quite good, but the script was overblown. It reminded me of ""Out of the Furnace"" a bit, and sort of fell flat for the same reasons. There was nothing uplifting about this movie and the movie spent too much time in dismal, downtrodden territory. It is also a little too much of a psychological downer.",1421107200,,1822,4.507552870090635

5254897,5,B0093DFMJ4,"Truly, it concerns me a little bit, that there are over 100 one-star reviews. Many times viewers en up unhappy with a film because what they came to the table to eat was not given to them. ""A Place Beyond The Pines"" is not here to serve you; it's here to serve the story and it's one of gnawing realism.

We hunt dreams in our lives, sometimes we achieve them, sometimes we do not. An sometimes on that journey our desire for that ream burns it up  before it ever comes to life. This film is the telling of that story and its subsequent fallout. Yes it's heartbreaking, but it also finds sweet truth in a final heartwarming understanding.

On the note of narrative structure  I was impressed at how the film follows the thread of the story. Characters come an characters go, because they are not the point. The message was the point. It feels more like three distinctive films -- and that style was refreshing, as well as impressive to have pulled it off, without feeling one part carried more weight than others.

5254907,5,B0093DFMJ4,"It is certainly not a heavy weight crime thriller as described above. However it is an inter-generational tale of ""bad genes"" and ""bad nurture"" passed down the line. As such it certainly hangs together if in a slightly artificial way. From a plot point of view it could never aspire to be a great film, but is nonetheless, slick and polished (for example the soundtrack and music are just right) fascinating, current and contains a few intense performances (and all above average) the acting being the best part of it.

Out of the cast, the always charismatic Eva Mendes, Bradley Cooper, darkly sinister Ray Liotta and even the edgy Ryan Gosling, are too much within their acting comfort zones to offer the nth degree over and above sterling commitment to their parts - the trailer and their comments rather confirm that!

It is rather the secondary roles that emerge as compelling and in particular the two off spring, who carry the can: Dane Dehaan (a latter day James Dean who in my opinion walks away with the film) searingly intense and Emery Cohen, slimely corrupt, with a passing resemblance to that obnoxious millionaire heir on Dr Drew's ""Celebrity Re Hab"", Jason somebody or other, and this is my abiding overall impression of the film.

Director Cianfrance is obviously trying to say something and it must be something like this: if his country is only 5 per cent similar to this story then - boy - we are all in a lot of trouble! Pervasive, endemic corruption and immorality are the order of the day, with little in the way of any self correcting mechanism or heroics to compensate. Indeed, even the notion of heroics is stood on its head. The central characters, the two male leads, are ""wrong 'uns"" from the start. The one knocked about character who emerges sympathetically, seems to be redeemed as the timeless innocent fool of legend. But is he just another link in a crooked chain of events that plays out off screen, rides off into the sunset - naturally our hearts, hopes and best wishes with him - but we will never know.

From that point of view, this showcasing of a director who can offer a serious comment film with a gripping and ambitious format and a stand out performance by Dane Dehaan, this film must be viewed as an exceptional achievement.

I will look out for more work from these two in the future. Because it is SO MUCH BETTER than most coming out of Hollywood it gets an unqualified 5 stars from me.",1416787200,,2436,4.62962962962963

5254910,4,B0093DFMJ4,"The Place Beyond the Pines is an ambitious, and at times emotionally powerful film, that ultimately fails to live up to its own ambitions. The film starts out as an earnest exploration of one man's attempt to be a father and, for many filmmakers, that story would offer more than enough meat to satisfy their meager appetites; but, as the film goes along, it becomes clear that Derek Cianfrance has grander ambitions, and the film quickly turns into an intergenerational tale, involving two intertwined families, that attempts to explore the tragic consequences of a decision made in a moment of desperation.

Unfortunately, the film climaxes too early and the emotional charge that is built up in the first act is left to fizzle out in the third. The first act of the film centers around Luke (Ryan Gosling), a motorcycle stuntman in a traveling carnival, who learns that a previous fling with a local waitress, Romina (Eva Mendes), resulted in a son named Jason. The pathos of the first act of the film is a result of the conflict between Luke's sincere paternal feelings and his inability to find a way to express those feelings in an appropriate way. Watching Luke is like watching a river before it has had a chance to carve a channel for itself: it simply overflows in all directions at once and leaves ruin and floating debris in its wake (the second and third acts of the film are about the floating debris).

In the first act, Luke tries his best to be a father but, as we learn in passing, he never had a father of his own, and he is hampered by an overly simplistic notion of fatherhood. He seems to believe that ""being a father"" is simply synonymous with ""being a material provider"", and when he cannot find a legitimate way to provide for his son, he turns to robbing banks. He also lacks tact in dealing with Romina's current boyfriend Kofi (Mahershala Ali). The audience is constantly hoping that Luke will find a way to make it clear to Kofi that he wants to be a part of his son's life, without turning Kofi into an enemy, but he lacks the emotional intelligence necessary for that and instead resorts to violence.

Without the emotional intelligence necessary to steer a course through an admittedly complex situation, Luke winds up turning everyone against him, and, in one final act of desperation, attempts to rob two banks in one day, and is gunned down and killed by a rookie cop named Avery (Bradley Cooper). Luke's story is tragic because his motivations are good, but, as a result of his upbringing, the situation is simply too much for him. Contrary to what some people believe, the world does sometimes give us more than we can handle, and our ships sometimes sink despite all our good intentions. Sometimes we find ourselves shipwrecked on a foreign shore with all the materials necessary to build a ship but without any of the right tools. Luke tragically lacks the right tools though he does his best with what he has.

After Luke's death the film shifts focus to Avery. I applaud Cianfrance's decision to shift the entire focus of the movie onto a character that did not even appear in the first 45 minutes of the film - I cannot remember ever seeing a film that took that kind of narrative risk. The second act of the film centers around Avery's emotional and moral conflict over his actions. In the media he has been branded a hero but he knows in his heart that, because of him, a child is going to grow up without a father. There is a powerful scene with a group of cops who drag Avery along as they engage in an illegal search of Romina's house, which inspired in me the same rage and despair I feel whenever I see such a blatant abuse of power, but, unfortunately, the second act never succeeds in reaching the emotional depths (or heights) of the first act.

Avery is at first portrayed as a very sympathetic character but the film begins to unravel when Avery is suddenly transformed from a morally conflicted police officer into an opportunistic and ruthless politician. This sudden change of character winds up undercutting the earlier conflict with his father - a judge with high ambitions for his son - and makes that conflict seem paper thin, more a conflict over means rather than ends. While the film starts to unravel in the second act, it really comes undone in the third as the focus shifts again, this time to Avery's son, AJ (Emory Cohen), and Luke's son, Jason (Dane DeHaan).

In the third and final act, AJ and Luke become the unconscious puppets of all the unresolved conflicts inherited from their fathers. We are now in the world of Greek tragedy, where children are forced to act out a destiny determined by events that took place before they were born, but the idea that the two teenagers just happen to meet and become friends is too contrived even for a world ruled by chance and fate. Perhaps that kind of coincidence would work in some films, but not in a film that went to such great lengths in pursuit of realism in the first two acts. We are suddenly lifted out of the realistic world of Charles Dickens and thrown into the world of Harry Potter, a fantasy world ruled by magical coincidence, and it is too dramatic a shift.

Cianfrance also has a much harder time figuring out the two new leads. The emotional trajectory of AJ is believable but Jason is another story. It is difficult for the audience to connect or sympathize with Jason because his emotional arc quickly launches him into the stratosphere. In this case, playing it smaller would have been more powerful and, with a simpler structure in the third act - without the coincidental meeting and the sudden revelations - it would have been easier for the audience to get a handle on Jason and his emotional struggles. The final denouement succeeds in being unpredictable but, only because it starts to feel as if Cianfrance himself is unsure where the film is going, and we can feel him desperately searching for an ending that will wrap things up in an emotionally satisfying way.

Cianfrance had lightning in the first act, but he did not have a bottle to trap it in, and it escaped and simply sizzled out in the third. Despite my disappointment, I still applaud Cianfrance for his ambitions. One can only hope that subsequent filmmakers will continue right where Cianfrance left off and learn from both his successes and failures.",1416528000,,6361,4.632978723404255

5254952,4,B0093DFMJ4,"The Place Beyond The Pines is the kind of film that I love. The film is broken up into three stories, starring three different actors, and it all comes together at the end. The film is about two men, one is a criminal, the other is a cop, and both have a decision to make. One makes the right choice, the other makes the wrong one, and fifteen years later, both decisions have a huge impact on their children, who come together in High School. Each part features a different actor, Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Dane DeHann. While they were all terrific, it's Cooper who really stands out. I thought he was good in Limitless, but he blows that performance away, giving an Oscar worthy portrayal. Due to the violent nature of the film, of course the Academy overlooked him, but you will be hard pressed to find a better performance all year. He was magically and is the thread that connects the stories. Without Cooper being at his best, this film probably wouldn't have worked out as well as it did. There are so many supporting stars and the story becomes so much more complex than it appears to be. Watching The Place Beyond The Pines was really like seeing three different short plays, that are loosely tied together, but don't make much of an impact until you see the fourth and final act. Once you see the whole picture, you will be blown away, both by the magnitude of the story and an unexpected conclusion. The cast and previews for this film really didn't excite me that much, but the reviews were strong, I gave it a chance, and what I found was another must see movie.",1404604800,,1583,4.462068965517242

5254956,4,B0093DFMJ4,"I've mainly seen Bradley Cooper do comedy (and do it very well), while the few movies I've seen featuring Ryan Gosling have all been mostly forgettable.  But crikey, can these two actors do drama, as evidenced by THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES, a gripping, highly poignant tale about guilt, angst, rebellion, and redemption.  And as this film comes full circle, we watch as a second generation of sons slowly connects the dots to the actions of their fathers.  And actions very much have consequences.

Ryan Gosling plays Luke, a daredevil motorcycle stuntman who turns to crime once he learns he's fathered a son via a brief interlude with a groupie (Eva Mendes).  He robs banks to support the child, which brings him into contact with law enforcement, in particular, an officer named Avery (Bradley Cooper).  As the first act of this film concludes, Avery confronts Luke during a violent shootout.  (*Spoiler alert!*)  Luke subsequently is killed, while Avery is consumed by guilt that he's killed the father of a toddler the same age as his own son.  Avery's police force is ruthlessly corrupt; in fact, they've stolen all the money Luke has taken and hidden under his son's crib.  The second portion of the film concerns Avery's exposing the corrupt force, putting fellow officers in jail, and moving on to the District Attorney's office.  The story fast forwards around fifteen years later, with Luke's son, Jason (Dane DeHaan), a brooding loner, while Avery's son, AJ (Emory Cohen), is a rebellious teen.  With both teens unaware of the connection between their fathers, they become dysfunctional friends.  And finally, once Jason learns the truth about Avery's involvement in his father's death, there is an attempt at revenge which moves towards begrudging redemption.

The supporting cast is stellar, including Mahershala Ali, Rose Byrne, Ben Mendelsohn, and Ray Liotta.  One star off due to the film's needless length, with its subsequent meandering.  Yet overall, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a compelling drama headlined by two actors who definitely need to take on more of these darker roles.  Gosling and Cooper demonstrate remarkable range.

5254957,3,B0093DFMJ4,"The Place Beyond the Pines is more of a Broadway play turned movie than a book turned movie. There are clearly 3 very different acts in the movie and then a finale, each act following one character until a major event happens and another character takes the unquestionable lead. You could almost say that it is 3 short movies tied together. The acting is PERFECT, but there is not enough character development and each act ends before you really feel that you know and sympathize with the character which is why I gave this movie 3 stars. I did not have any emotion for any of the characters. I did not feel sorry when one died, happy when someone succeeded or worried about someone being discovered. It was entertaining and I did not feel I wasted my time, but there are better movies out there. Worth renting, not worth purchasing or re-watching.

For those looking for Ryan Gosling or Ray Liota, look elsewhere, Ryan is just the first act, Ray is only in the movie for 5 minutes in the second act. If you are looking for good acting, stop looking, you found your movie. For those looking for an emotional movie or an action movie, keep searching.",1404000000,,1149,4.524038461538462

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

The film's title is loosely based on a Native American name for Schenectady, New York, where the story takes place. Director Derek Cianfrance's effort represents an improvement over his prior blue collar soap opera, 'Blue Valentine'. Here, his story is more ambitious, a triptych of sorts, focusing on a group of interconnected characters.

In Part 1 of 3, the strongest of the three stories, Ryan Gosling is Luke Blanton, a 'bad boy' motorcycle stuntman who quits his job in order to raise his one year old son who he fathered with a former flame, Romina. Much to his chagrin, she's now involved with another man, Kofi, and wants nothing to do with him.

Luke soon befriends Robin, a former bank robber and now owner of a small auto repair business, who suggests that a good way to provide for his son, is to rob banks. Gosling does a fine job in depicting our resident psychopath as he goes about terrorizing bank customers and brutally assaulting Romina's boyfriend with a wrench after he brings a crib over for the baby at the boyfriend's residence (the assault results in Luke's arrest). Everything is rationalized in the name of being a 'good father' and Luke's violent behavior keeps escalating. When Robin wants out of the bank robbery business he dismantles Luke's motorcycle but Luke sticks a gun in his mouth and confiscates the bail money which Robin had laid out.

Part 2 (not as good as Part 1) begins when Luke reaches the end of the line after being caught in the act of his final bank robbery. He ends up in a residential home where we're introduced to the new protagonist, PO Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), who shoots Luke before he gets his own shot off, hitting Cross in the knee. Luke then falls out the window and bleeds to death on the pavement below.

There seems to be some question as to whether Avery was justified in shooting Luke, especially because he gave him no chance to surrender. At the same time, things happened so fast, that Avery probably had a good case in arguing the shooting was completely justified, since it was quite probable that Luke was armed and could have shot him right away (and as it turned out, Luke indeed was armed and did fire his gun, but only after Avery shot him first). As it turns out, an internal police investigation exonerates Avery but he remains guilt-ridden simply because he killed a fellow human being. Avery even tells a police psychologist that he can't stop thinking about Luke's son when he looks at his own son.

It seems odd that Avery would go along with the two crooked fellow officers, Scotty and Deluca, who confiscate Luke's bank robbery stash from underneath Romina's son's crib. They gave him the lion's share and we soon find out why Avery goes along: he offers Romina all of his share back, but she refuses. What happens next didn't seem believable at all. Avery decides to rat out his fellow officers by going to the chief of police. Now why wouldn't Avery realize that the chief of police is just as bad as his fellow officers and would end up telling them about his decision to report their illegal actions? This is borne out when Deluca asks Avery to follow him in his car and he complies, until it suddenly dawns on him (duh!), this is an ambush (wouldn't anyone with any common sense have figured out what was going down?).

Avery seemingly has a way out when he records another officer who's trying to steal drugs from the police property room where Avery is now relegated to. Avery uses the tape to blackmail the DA who is forced to prosecute all the corrupt cops. We're asked to flash forward 15 years but wouldn't Avery still be in danger? Yes, all the cops have been jailed but I'm sure they have plenty of friends in town who might want to get back at him (and what about when the cops get out of jail later on?). So again, would any normal person put their trust in a police chief who is suspect from the get-go?

Part 3 focuses on Avery's teenage son, AJ who unknowingly befriends Luke's son, Jason, while they're students together in high school. AJ's parents are now divorced and he appears to be severely influenced by gang culture. Unfortunately, there's only one scene which shows the interaction between father and son (Avery confronts AJ after he's arrested for assaulting Jason). So why did AJ turn out the way he did? Not explained. We're asked to assume that Avery's quest to become state attorney keeps him away from acting as a good parent.

Even less convincing is Jason's quest to take revenge on Avery. He never had any connection to Luke and only learns about him from talking to Robin and reading old newspaper clippings. Furthermore, Romina and Kofi appear to have been good parents. I can see why he wants to get back at AJ (whose initial assault on him was particularly brutal) but why Avery? Perhaps it's just a teenager's impulsivity but Avery's reaction where he gets down on his knees and begs forgiveness just seems over the top. It goes all the way back to when Avery shot Luke--should he have felt that guilty? To my mind, he was doing his job as a police officer; and had Luke not robbed banks and broken into someone's house, Avery would not have had to shoot Luke in the first place.

Director Cianfrance aims high here and manages to keep one's interest throughout. Nonetheless, only the first story, the chronicle of the psychopath Luke, proves compelling. Avery and the two boys are not developed well enough and let's not even discuss the female characters. 'Pines' is no masterpiece but is still worth a look!",1402531200,2,5609,4.6158475426278835

Theres a poeticism to Cianfrances images, like in Blue Valentine, but unlike many skilled auteurs, Cianfrance imagines his new film with a whole new visual palette, in terms of blocking, movement and color, and its equally stunning. The Place Beyond the Pines is haunting. Sometimes hauntingly sad and other times hauntingly beautiful. There's a moment of forgiveness and mercy in this film, which shines as a beacon of light bursting through the overwhelming hopelessness of the rest.

There is sort of a ""Janet Leigh Psycho Moment"" in the film and you wonder...OH MY WORD...NOW WHAT?  But don't dispair...you will continue to be completely engrossed!  I even had to run the film back to a certain spot to be sure that ""what I saw was what actually happened.""  None of this probably makes any sense to you, but you will fully understand what I mean once you view it.  Also....my interpretation is that the title of the film ONLY MAKES SENSE at the very end of the story!  I think you will agree as well.

I put off watching THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES because of the mixed reviews here and elsewhere, and quickly learned what a positive sign mixed reviews can be. This film comprises an intelligent, well-acted, and well-filmed story that spans two generations, involving a wild but believable chain of coincidences. It has a number of twists and keeps you guessing what will happen next but is still very lucid in the end. Without being the least bit heavy-handed, it's revealing of all sorts of things about this life, such as how much the results can differ between those on the ""right"" and those on the ""wrong"" sides of the law even when they're  playing basically the same game and aren't much different in their tactics. (Also, how the crime that most often does one in is simply not knowing when to stop and getting caught.)

The most common criticisms of THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES seem to be ""too long"" and ""boring."" Granted, it's not an ""action film"" per se; PBP moves at a very natural pace. All the same, plenty happens: I did not find one truly dull stretch throughout its 140 minutes and did not want it to end. While not a happy story in its own right, PBP has its happier moments; while grim and violent in several places, with some mild gore, there's nothing gratuitous in these areas. It's never particularly funny, nor does it try to be, but it's not deliberately grim either. There are a few blank spots here and there, most of which are probably best left blank. One or two details are also a little hard to buy--e.g., the photo and $ kept by Avery. Yet, viewed from any major angle, THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES is a truly fine film.

Great performances by Gosling and Cooper, as well as by Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan as sons AJ and Jason. Still, the people-in-general here are all very real and immediate, and no actor or character completely dominates the show.",1394236800,,1891,4.569321533923304

5254996,5,B0093DFMJ4,"I debated whether to give this film 5 or 4 stars simply because I did not come away uplifted, or even with a feeling of closure from ""justice having been served, etc."" However, I've come to conclude that I can't fault the film - as it merely retained its integrity and remained, overall ""realistic"" in it's gut-wrenching human tragedy.

The most appealing part of the film is its representation of men as providers in more than just a superficial sense; it well relays the height of a man's actualization as ""being there for his family"" (in the case of Ryan, who turns to desperate measures in an attempt to fulfill this underlying good drive) - and, on the flip side, the cost of deviating from a life of integrity (the other pillar of manhood) - in the tormented, falsely successful life of the cop who becomes a hero by bringing Ryan to justice.

We see a strange complexity develop, in which it is inescapable that Ryan, though ""completely unskilled"", and ""with a history of violence"" (and an uncontrolled temper as well) - is actually the superior and more admirable man compared to the cop, who has every sanction of society placed upon him after committing murder - and, in one touching scene - robbing the very last inheritance from a mere baby. (On a tangent, I think that scene more than anything else in the movie is what will stay with me; I hate to see children taken advantage of, and the scene was very well done in even in its overt symbolism).

The film truly progresses as a tragedy, where we see, by a domino effect, that all of the hope and love that Ryan had for his son is literally robbed from him by the lawyer-cop. Though unbearably depressing and deterministic, it illustrates the importance of a father, and how formative it is to have even the least-accomplished father, as long as that person is loving and well intention ed.

Throughout the film, I kept thinking ""well, and what could have happened differently so as to prevent Ryan's son from coming to the inescapable demise of 'following in his father's footprints' - ironically exactly what the father did not want him to do"". Honestly, looking at the characters in the film - the one I found most reprehensible was neither the cop, nor the cop's son, nor the surrogate father - but the character of the Mom. I am not sure if she was supposed to come off as an insufferable, irrational, opportunistic - well, let's leave it at that - but, really her character almost defied human sensibility. I mean, to see the father of her only child at the time beg for the opportunity to be given a shot to provide for his son, to be part of his life - a man who was not portrayed as being addicted to anything more serious than cigarettes, and who even took up being a mechanic in an attempt to begin the process of being there for his family - well - that's just the most despicable thing in the whole film. I found it actually extremely offensive as a woman. There are so many single Moms out there whose exhusbands take no interest in them, much less their children - that the thought of a single Mom who would prefer to live with some other guy who is not even the kid's father - and would heartlessly mock him after he quit his job so as to be closer to his son - it just got me really angry.

But I guess that's what's so great about the film. It takes you to all the miserable places you never want to go. It takes you into the tortured life of the cop - who - is not 100% slime - and does have remediating guilt - but, who is mostly a deplorable and tortured individual - and who can never make it past the crime he committed to be a father on any level for his own son. It takes you into the resultant weed-like growth of the cop's son - stemming from all the unmet needs for attention. It takes you through the poverty and result of lack of education / skills / jobs in the poorer subdivision. It basically takes you through all forms of hell, but, expertly so.

I guess you just have to make the decision whether you want to endure that on a Saturday night or not. Still a good film I thought.",1391385600,,4077,4.350854139290408

5255002,2,B0093DFMJ4,"Glad I did not pay for this. The director set out, I think, to make a very arty, weighty movie.  He had the materials: fine actors; compelling premise; a visually interesting approach.  Still, it stalled.  Two fathers, criminal and cop, intersect in the criminal's death, both leaving infant sons in the terrified care of their mothers. The cop, conflicted over the killing, nevertheless rides his ""hero"" hype into a political career, neglecting his son along the way.  Fifteen years pass, and who'd a thunk it, the sons meet up and appear to be the victims of their DNA....one exhibiting his cop father's careless arrogance and the other riding off to an uncertain but violent future.  It just dragged and dragged on.  There is the nature versus nurture issue sloooooooowly emerging.  The criminal's kid (an infant when his dad died) his raised in a good family with a loving stepfather yet seems to have his father's innate angst stamped on his soul.  The cop's kid, initially a punk, gets a little starstruck seeing his father elected Atty General. Speaking of history repeating, Ryan Gosling is ""James Dean"" hot with a cig hanging out of his tattooed face and doing that steely-eyed stare and deadpan delivery that he is becoming typecast for. Time to mix it up Ryan, even if you do make the ladies gasp. Bradley Cooper as the cop is far more nuanced and delivers a solid character development.

Why the son went astray is a good topic alone for a movie and I wish had been examined more fully. Other than that, a tremendously well acted and written picture.",1387238400,,629,4.384615384615385

5255074,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Ryan Gosling was in high demand this year from directors who had already used him to great effect.  You had Nicolas Winding Refn botch his second chance with the actor in the abominable Only God Forgives, but Derek Cianfrance (who almost directed Gosling to an Oscar nomination in Blue Valentine) made the most of his second experience with the actor to give us a very strong character, performance, filmwhatever you want to call it.  While The Place Beyond the Pines has its faults (and well get to those in a minute), the film has a presence that is FELT, and both director and actor(s) do their best to create, maintain and sustain that presence.

The Place Beyond the Pines is essentially a three-part story; a tapestry piece of sorts that has stronger ties than your average interwoven storyline.  You have the first half, which focuses on a young and reckless motorcycle stunt rider who has becomes aware of his young son only to walk into a sticky situation when he realizes that his babys mother has moved on.  Determined to provide for his child and win back his baby-mamma, he turns to a life of crime.

This is where the films second act picks up, where we have a newly promoted police officer dealing with the consequences (both moral and legal) of a shootout that caused the death of the aforementioned motorcycle driver.  Plagued with a sharply ambiguous guilt (is it real guilt over his actions or more remorse over the consequences?), this cop finds himself being taken advantage of by cops on the force, a punching bag and maneuverable pawn piece until he takes matters into his own hands and carves out his future with the press of a record button.

And then we are shot forward over a decade to a school cafeteria where this cop and this deceased motorcycle rider are reunited in part due to their sons, who happen to strike up an unlikely friendship.

Each part has its strengths, but the film does undergo a gradual decline with each passing section.  The first part is by far the most inspired and it sets up the film for a real nice progression of character development, which DOES carry through into the second section (and, surprise-surprise, Bradley Cooper gives the best performance in the film) in a great way as we watch this cop deal with his current predicament (and honestly, the character of Avery Cross is such an interesting one), and despite the clich&eacute;d dirty cop angle, the second act survives on the strength of Coopers portrayal of EVERY crevice of this mans identity.  Still, the film is almost uprooted completely by the third act, which feels like such a lazy tack-on in so many ways.  First, the idea that the two sons would meet by pure coincidence feels very uninspired, but the primary idea of this film (the whole sins of the father mantra) is force fed in a rather ridiculous manner (especially that final scene) that it feels sadly dishonest.  Derek Cianfrance had a great opportunity to build a marvelous character study (which is almost did) wrapped in a truly inspired prose, but his prose suffers from lack of originality when it comes to making it all work.  As individual parts, maybe (although outside of Dane DeHaans performance, I really see no redemption for that third act), but as a whole the film starts to feel drug out and uneven; scattered even.

And still, the impact is felt and that presence lingers from frame to frame thanks to breathtaking cinematography and visual scope, and those tailored and uniform (so cohesive) performances.  Gosling, Cooper and DeHaan really connect from act to act, anchoring their segments in a real grasp of identity.  Even DeHaan, who has to muddle through some really trite character developments (the fight scene, the kidnapping and the final scene all reek of obvious), finds ways to FEEL through each moment in a way that earns our trust.  You believe him, even if his story makes little sense.

But I don't think I can praise Bradley Cooper enough, and I really didn't expect to EVER say that.  I still remember being baffled throughout most of last years awards season and being in complete denial about Coopers Oscar chances.  Like, how is this guy suddenly a good actor?  Seriously, hes brilliant here.  He understands the small things, the slight details that color in a complete character.  The best thing about the character of Avery is that he is a complete and total fake; a self-promoting jerk who NEEDS to be loved and respected, yet Cooper never shies away from making him human and exposing his frailty in a very honest progression of emotions and reactions.",1383868800,,4582,4.763590391908976

5255102,4,B0093DFMJ4,"The repeated images of the pines, the carnival, the duality of the good character and the bad or at least really messed up character, the corrupt police...I thought either would have been interesting to see David Lynch direct this film or at the director/storywriter Derek Cianfrance, has taken some cues from DL.

In any case , I would say that DL style of filmaking was not a gimmick but could be a genre in its own right much as film noir or rom/com is.  Granted this film doesnt have the humourous or bizarre Lynch elements but then Cianfrance who has been working on film since the age of 13 (argh so jealous ...I made a few films at 14 but had no luck..and slowly gave up). And has studied film seriously since then. I haven't seen his other movies yet but TPBTP makes me want to see what else he has done.

Some have said the movie is too slow moving and the third part is like a long drawn out epilogue.  It is slow moving but also has some rattling energetic chase scenes and at least three or four very tense confrontations. In other words it doesnt put you to sleep.

I thought it did get a bit to reflective/instrospective and all that.  Characters wallowing (for years) over an event (one his child he can't be with and the other a violent act he almost was forced to commit).  Sure tough stuff but as a film it can only carry a film so far.  I for one like films where there is a transition a change etc in a characters predicament.

That said though four stars for the atmospher the film creates.  Again very Lynch like: a world with dark places and light shining through the dark where its unexpected.  This is a grim film but it has hints of hope unlike many other grim dark films where things just get worse and worse .

Finally I really got to admit the scene with the three motorcycles in the Iron ball was great.  An amazing feat in its own right but kinda set the mood of the film from there.",1382313600,,1914,4.268698060941828

5255116,2,B0093DFMJ4,"Derek Cianfrance, the director that made such a splash with the very powerful open-nerve-painful disintegrating-marriage story that was BLUE VALENTINE, is someone who obviously has a vision. With THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES, I suppose some of my dislike of this film has to do with expectations, but most of it has to do with the storytelling and some of the performances.

Almost everyone in this film is typecast as something we've seen them do before, which was upsetting to a degree, but would have been more upsetting if the talented people behind these characters weren't as good as they are. Ryan Gosling plays a BMX-bike riding minor phenom who turns to a life of crime (using his cyclist skills, no less) when he discovers that a fling he had a year prior with Eva Mendes had yielded a son. Fate in the form of cop Bradley Cooper turns up, who also has a year-old son with caring wife Rose Byrne, and as he ascends to hero status in the Schenectady Police Department, he becomes a political animal as he discovers that his job is rife with corruption. In the blink of an eye, the film skips ahead 15 years and now follows the lives of the two sons; Cooper's black-sheep son Emory Cohen and Gosling's loner son Dane DeHaan, who naturally are on a collision course that was determined for them both 15 years prior.

Gosling, who is such a great young actor, really pulls his role off well despite the fact that we've seen shadows of this in his career already with his role in the brilliant DRIVE. Dane DeHaan is another young performer that is absolutely electric to watch, but it seems like most of his roles consist of people seeing him in the astonishingly well-done CHRONICLE. Mendes, Byrne, Ray Liotta and Bruce Greenwood, all great performers in their own right, are wholly under-utilized in this film. The first act of this film is amazing, until Cooper's character starts driving the narrative, and like most films with Cooper in them, in my opinion, is when it starts spiraling out of control. Newcomer Cohen performes with swagger, giving a portrayal of one of the most authentic douchebags in recent cinema.

And Cianfrance, who clearly has talent behind the camera and composing some beautiful shots, knows the story he wants to tell and desperately wants to give it an epic quality, but it falls too short too fast, and leaves us to wallow in a miserable stew of predictability. He had some real opportunities to turn some of the trappings of this kind of crime drama on its head, but doesn't.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a film filled to the brim with potential that ends up being squandered throughout most of the film.",1381622400,,2644,4.667381974248927

5255128,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

I've seen more than my fare share of films this year, but none have gripped me the way The Place Beyond the Pines did. Beyond just telling a great story, the way that story is executed is both creative and inventive. Instead of following one character throughout the entire film, The Place Beyond the Pines tells three separate stories. It does this to show how everything we do has consequences. You may only have a brief interaction with a stranger, but whether you realize it or not their life is forever altered because of it. Now the repercussions in this film are more drastic than those from an everyday interaction, but the point remains the same.

The Place Beyond the Pines is separated into three acts based on the three stories present. Act one follows Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling), a stuntman turned robber who wants to provide for the son he never knew he had; act two follows Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a police officer who's life is changed forever after stopping Luke during a robbery; and the final act starts fifteen years later and follows the sons of these two individuals, Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen). The actions taken by both Luke and Avery echo into the next generation as we see their children cope with the repercussions of their confrontation.

As I arrived at the conclusion of act one, I felt this overwhelming sense of being misled. The trailer for the film suggests one thing, but the film itself is something very, very different. However, it didn't take long before those feelings began to disappear. As the story progressed, I became more invested with each passing moment. I didn't just want to see what happened, I needed to. There was something beyond just the general desire to reach the story's conclusion. Moving from one story to the next created an attachment to each character in a way I've never experienced. Seeing these two very different lives collide and create a ripple effect was both entertaining and insanely satisfying.

The way the story is structured is unlike anything I've ever seen before and, for the most part, it works extremely well. Unfortunately, this unusual structure also results in the film feeling a bit uneven during certain areas of the narrative. In fact, the further you progress in the story, the more uneven it becomes. Almost as if each transition depletes some of the film's energy. Upon reaching the film's final moments I realized that Luke was the initial domino that started this chain reaction. Because of this, no matter how far you get in the story, his presence is always felt. This makes the remaining characters feel less important in comparison.

With that said, though, Avery's life was the only one that seemed underdeveloped. As we transitioned from act two to act three, we missed out on fifteen years of his life and none of it was ever truly explained. The writers bring you up to speed in terms of what exactly is going on, but they never flesh out what happened during this missed time period. Because of this, I was left confused and slightly irritated because I had to make assumptions instead of being told what exactly happened. It made his part of the narrative very underwhelming even though he was a key element in regard to how the story played out.

As far as ensemble casts go, it's very rare that you receive one this good. Not only were these actors outstanding from start to finish, but everyone involved felt made for their role. Gosling and Cooper each gave one of the best performances of their respective careers and Dane DeHaan was horrifyingly intense. His gestures and tone of voice went hand-in-hand with those of Gosling, almost to the point where you would assume they were related. Still, it doesn't stop there. Even the minor performers like Eva Mendes and Ben Mendelsohn were equally phenomenal, which helped bring a certain level of importance to every character.

Finally, the music present in The Place Beyond the Pines is both gripping and beautiful. Composed by Mike Patton, the score does wonders to bring each and every scene to life. It provides a sense of atmosphere in ways I never knew were possible. It reached a point where I no longer felt like a viewer watching the film, but an innocent bystander in Schenectady witnessing this story take place. It does more than just provide a simple backdrop for the story, it provides that extra kick that truly makes the story come to life.

Overall Score: 8.9/ 10 - The Place Beyond the Pines is easily one of the most unique films I've seen in years. Its story is raw and it aims to be something more than just your average drama. While certain aspects of the narrative may be a bit uneven, the story itself doesn't suffer too much because of it. With the help of an amazing cast and an equally wonderful score, this is definitely a tale that will stick with you for years to come. I highly recommend you give it your time if given the opportunity.",1381104000,,4993,4.724454649827784

5255172,1,B0093DFMJ4,"RyGos is not the most photogenic actor out there, and he should hold onto whoever framed his shots, because he/she/it knew what he/she/it was doing. RyGos can act and I truly loved the first meeting with Eva and later in the church. Great stuff---really, really great! And kudos here to the director because neither scene was overdone. Each was poignant and perfect. The church scene really shows the white trash vs. decent life choice he had. Also, his acting in the diner when he says not to talk down to him---poignant and perfect---both the acting and the direction and the writing.  So, I was intrigued. I thought this guy is motivated to get his life together.

I was even sympathetic to the robberies, if he had used that as a launch pad to something, some way of life.

And then the movie veered way west of where I thought it was going and moved down deep into white trashville, with no return.

There was NO ONE and I mean NO ONE to cheer for, and what do you have then? Eva is a slut living with one man IN HIS HOME with her mother, no less, and her child, and sleeping with this other guy. Again, if they had truly been in love, I could have gone there. But then we have RyGos flip into the mental ward---figuratively.  I turned it off. I didn't even get to the BradCoo part---amazing to me that any storyteller/director/writer would bring a central character in that late---should have been Act 1, IMHO.

Me thinks RyGos needs to find himself a great writer and hang on for dear life, because he cannot pick them. This is not the first time RyGos, and you could be AcadAward guy. He's really a good actor, just needs a vehicle. It's almost like two people wrote this movie, one going in one direction and one going in another.

5255179,3,B0093DFMJ4,"The place beyond the pines is a movie about a motorcycle stunt rider who turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his ex-girlfriend and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.

The film initially concentrates on Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) and his relationship to his ex Romina (Eva Mendez)then later on switches to the rising star cop (Bradley Cooper) and then later on to both men's sons as their worlds cross. Thrown in for good measure is the corrupt cop in the force played like always Ray Liotta.

This story has a lot of potential but I found out as I watched that it seems to get lost in itself and seems to wonder into the forest that it is trying to display. The story meanders on at times and the character development seems to be a bit flat and unmoving.

The story is an intriguing one and has some decent performances from Gosling, Mendez and Liotta but the movie is a bit too long, gets lost and drags on a bit too much, concentrating on some aspects of the film too much and lacking in others and seemingly throwing some other elements in for good measure. To me, I thought the bike robbing father could have been its own movie without the rest and would have probably stood up better on its on. I am not so sure why they threw in the corrupt cop thing as it seemingly was a small part of the movie and was just kind of left out there with the passage of time. And when it came to the teenagers and the movie ending, I didn't really feel any emotion because the development of any sentiment towards them wasn't there for me especially since the initial character was troubled and pretty unlikeable from the very beginning.

The movie itself is a decent watch but fell short of what I thought could have been a great overall story that brought you in and made you feel something. In the end, I just felt disappointed.",1379721600,2,1949,4.390581717451523

I watched this particular flick because I had been hearing a lot about it, and that's probably the only reason you need to as well. FYI, Ryan Gosling isn't in the film the whole time, so if you are a huge fan and want to watch a film all about him, you're going to be disappointed. While I think the idea of following families across generations was a good one, it made for a film that seemed to drag on, and I think the ""it's okay"" labeling of the 3 star system for rating in amazon sums it up perfectly. I felt like some of the actions/decisions made by the characters were completely ridiculous and not what you would do in real life, which probably added to general feeling of 'bummed' I felt when it was over. It's kind of like you're given a gift of an opportunity to look into the lives of a few families and the cause and effects of why they are where they are today; and in the end you're left feeling unsympathetic, disappointed and a bit unfulfilled.",1379721600,,1276,4.406779661016949

It's one of those movies that sticks with me long after the credits have rolled.  It's a thinking person's movie, and they are becoming rare indeed.

My one regret is that the director didn't exploit the rawness of Schenectady to its fullest.  It's a gritty place, and it was a masterful  decision to film there.  Minor complaint, though.",1379635200,,542,4.774193548387097

5255201,1,B0093DFMJ4,"The movie is about the bonds between fathers and sons, told in long, sad, and depressing tones. Gosling who has had outstanding performances in independent films, has turned into a one dimensional sad sack. His calling card is a long sad face without any emotions. He's sad and beautiful; and his acting capabilities have been put in the toilet. There's more to Cooper; more emotional range and natural survival instincts. However; changing Cooper to a middle aged man did not work. Somewhere close to the middle of the film we meet the teen age sons of Gosling & Copper, and this is where the film departs all sense of reality. The Cooper kid is a low life that's a prototype of trailer trash; but he has a lovely dedicated mother (Rose Byrne) and well educated father (Cooper). The actors are all beautiful people, that don't fit into this story of depressing losers.

5255208,4,B0093DFMJ4,"This is a case of director Derek Cianfrance trumping screenwriter Cianfrance.  This is not a bad story just one stretched past its natural length.  Its themes are obvious and its outcome is apparent way before the film is over.  Credit Cianfrance for making watchable relatively thin material and even making it somewhat interesting.  The primary theme of the film is that events in life come full circle.  Luke(Ryan Gosling) is a stunt cyclist on the carnival circuit when he finds out he has a child from a past tryst.  Without two dimes to rub together he is encouraged to take up bank robbing.  The first few jobs go smashingly but Luke doesn't know when to stop.  Because his first few capers went down easily he gets sloppy on his next one.  The bank is ready for him and the result is a high speed chase with the police in pursuit.  His main pursuer is a rookie patrolman on a corrupt police force, Avery(Bradley Cooper), who has a wife and newborn.  Ultimately it comes down to a faceoff between Luke and Avery in a house where Luke is holed up.  I try to avoid spoilers but I think you can read between the lines as to where this film is going.  Regardless, I liked it and the performances are all terrific.  Cianfrance is definitely a talent to watch.

5255233,3,B0093DFMJ4,"Here's a breakdown of what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy about Place Beyond the Pines:

What I liked:
 All of the motorcycle sequences involving Handsome Luke
 Ben Mendelsohn, who does an excellent job playing the role of Luke's estranged partner-in-crime
 I thought the surrounding cast was great
 The short sequence (and song!) when the kids pop Oxycontins at AJ's house party

------------------ SPOILERS BELOW! ------------------

What I didn't like:
 Ryan Gosling's death about 1/3 of the way into the movie --> A very difficult transition point for any viewer
 A pivotal scene between Bradley Cooper and Dane DeHaan in the woods felt empty to me

Killing off Handsome Luke early on was a gutsy call by Cianfrance.  He swung for the fences, and was robbed at the wall.  Even with the well-written story line and great performances, Place Beyond the Pines still fell short.  As of right now I am giving this film a 7/10 stars.",1378512000,,927,4.865384615384615

5255240,5,B0093DFMJ4,"The cinematography and acting in this film are brilliant. The characters are complex. It is slow-paced, but not inappropriately so. This is a character study film about people acting from sometimes wildly contradictory impulses; it is not a thriller or action flick really. So it's pointless to complain that there is not enough action flick stuff.

That being said, I couldn't watch it to the end. I didn't know exactly what was going to happen, but I knew it was going to end in a wreck of some sort. There is a basic bleakness to this film born of the characters' inability to stop the momentum of their own fate and choose differently.

So yes, okay, I get it, we are all flawed, good people do bad things, bad people can try and do good things.  The ending was also unfulfilling if not lame - lets see if anyone else doesn't think at least a pink slip or bill of sale would have made it a touch more real !
  Sorry.  my only regret is that I did not rent it instead of buying the digital version,  one and done here, there won't be a second viewing to see if I missed anything.

The significance of a man's role in the family and in a marriage is heavily explored from start to finish. All the main characters appeared very raw and believable. The casting was expert and the complexities of each character were portrayed very subtly without the need for much dialogue, which is always the genius of a well-written movie. The sins of our fathers was a reoccuring theme throughout, and you can feel the inadequacies, hopes, and fears of each character as time unfolds. What gets me the most is witnessing the sweetness and kindness behind each character despite their depravity or past mistakes. This is a very moving story of humanity. You can't help but empathize with each character.",1378166400,59,832,4.907801418439717

5255260,2,B0093DFMJ4,"A beautifully shot film with nicely understated performances, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a curious, experimental flick that never really rises above its own heavy-handedness. The film is essentially three short stories, one of which focuses on a circus performer turned bank robber (Gosling). His violent encounter with a young cop (Cooper) propels the film's second act into the life of that officer. The final third of of the film reveals how the lives of these two men, already inextricably intertwined, become even further entangled by their teenage sons.

The allegory of the film (the sins of the father are passed down to the son) is ponderous almost to distraction. Although told with patient, sumptuous detail, the characters never really seem much more than stereotypes. This may be because everything is done so quietly and subtly. It may also be because the script expects the potency of the situation to be enough to draw the heart. I don't know. All I know is the only person I felt sorry for was Romina (Eva Mendes), the only character to be truly likable and complex (and, of course, the character that gets dumped on more than any other...and that's saying a lot for a film that's as dismal as this one).

The rails really come off in the third act, when the film asks the audience to assume quite a bit about the teenage sons of these two flawed fathers. I won't go into too much detail to avoid spoilers, but I will say that Gosling's son appears to make decisions for no real reason. It seems like the movie is trying to say that there is something inescapable, something in the genes that propels him, but his behavior shifts radically and often. You can't even really blame it on puberty, since the shifts are way beyond even the wildest of teenage mood swings. It felt very much to me like the film just needed that thread of melodrama to keep on playing out, and it had no way to do it beyond highly exaggerated teenage angst.

I was planning on giving the film a solid three stars -- I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it -- until the final scene. Again, I'm avoiding spoilers here, but it was so gushingly symbolic, and so obviously attempting a kind of desperate palindromic poetry that it just felt like the movie was begging me to cry. Even worse, it didn't make a whole lot of sense in the grand scheme of things, and really all I could think of wasn't how deep and meaningful and powerful it was, but was how it was basically another stab in the side of the only character that provided me with any empathy: Mendes's Romina. The fact that the film relegates this powerful, complicated, long-suffering (much longer suffering than any of the male characters) female character to a footnote in the film in deference to this tired symbolism about fathers and sons was what finally annoyed me enough to drop my rating.",1378166400,15,2848,4.613412228796844

Some British theater deftly delivers the sadness of human failure (thinking of Harold Pinter's Betrayal, Karoline Leach's The Mysterious Mr. Love), but without a shred of doubt that good will come. I came out of this film with a certainty that it was the saddest film I had ever seen. The tactile images that pass in front of your eyes echo through generations and haunt those caught in the story line.
This is tragedy in a Shakespearian sense. It is modern film that will linger after the images end. It is one of the best serious films of the decade. Skip the stupid comedies for just one experience of human tragedy; this is the one.",1378080000,,921,4.554216867469879

That's about as far as I am willing to go. As I sit trying for the second time to watch this movie completely, yawning as the plot line just stagnates yet again, I wonder where Hollywood is going with this one. Obviously there's an intended new plot twist on the horizon, but the sun already set on two and I'm getting tired of this drawn-out series of quiet tragedies unraveled on-screen. Ryan Gosling's performance as a bad guy with a bad life until his son's surprise arrival gives him reason to do more bad things which would require more bad tattoos had he survived is really good. It's too bad the story doesn't deserve such a terrific performance. Yes, Ray Liotta is a good bad guy, and that guy from Alias is a good nervous cop with a bad bad shoot, and on and on. It's just that a 2 plus hour movie should be a little....more. My suggestion? Buy another movie. This one?

I was pleasantly surprised to find a very original and interesting story. Gosling's performance was really impressive, as were both of the teenage boys whose names escape me. Bradley Cooper's performance was a bit off, but it is possible that is because his character was kind of shallow. Ray Liotta played the same part he's played in half a dozen other pictures, and did it well, but I am not sure why his character was even necessary. All in all it was a very entertaining movie, but like many indies, could have been 45 minutes shorter without losing much.

Reason to see this on DVD: Ryan Gosling. The first third of the movie is spellbinding. Gosling reminds me of the oldtime cinema stars. He is spectacular and the opening tracking shot of a red-jacketed motorcycle rider striding towards the revolving cage of his circus act is worth the whole movie itself.

Gosling had never impressed me much before so I was surprised to feel genuine sympathy for his character, Luke. I should note that the characters intertwine with one another on multiple occasions and at unexpected junctures, so in order to fully enjoy this film one should go into it with patience. I quite liked the story and direction but I was also impressed with the fact that I think some true acting is displayed by Cooper. Mendes holds her own as well...

The acting is just as great as the cinematography, you'll know once you see the development of the minor characters as time passes. The story to me is divided up into three unique chapters: the first being Gosling trying to be a good dad to his now known son, the second being Cooper dealing with the broken family he created and the third being ""well if I tell you, you'll hate me"". It's best to watch it for yourself to truly understand the strength a director has when he works with an actor multiple times (See Johnny Depp and Tim Burton).",1377216000,,668,4.439024390243903

5255339,3,B0093DFMJ4,"It has a mood like ""The Outsiders"" and beautiful cinematography, but there are too many unbelievable plot twists to make it truly satisfying. It's not clear that the characters themselves learn anything, as much as they are acting out a kind of two-part morality play. The themes go something like this (*spoiler alert*): 1) kid throws away his talent and turns to thieving because he wants a relationship with his son, 2) cop exacts rough justice on the thief and feels pity for the thief's son, 3) cop gets ahead by exacting vengeance on other crooked cops but never confronts his own failings and loses his relationship with his own son; 4) cop's son inadvertently activates thief's son's drive to self-knowledge and thievery; 5) thief's son exacts rough justice on the cop, who finally (maybe) realizes he loves his own son; 6) thief's son reclaims his father's lost talent and (maybe) starts a new life. Overall, the movie seems to be showing the irony of how we take advantage of one another, yet also inadvertently exact rough justice on one another, through our blind groping to find meaning in relationships and make our way in life. We want to do good, but we're blinded by our failings, and in the end, no one is truly a hero. A bit depressing.",1377043200,,1255,4.709090909090909

5255342,5,B0093DFMJ4,"This is really three movies tacked on to each other.  They have related characters and themes, but each could work almost independently.

The first section with Ryan Gosling is by far the best.  Stunning in almost every way - filming, characters, story, setting, etc.

The other two are less compelling but demonstrate that the Director was trying for something very ambitious.  A sophisticated multi-generational story of intersecting plots and families.

To the negative reviewers out there - I agree it was 20 minutes too long.  However, I don't agree that it was boring or poorly made.

To the people who commented that they ""didn't like the characters,"" all I can say is maybe they should rent a Tom Hanks movie.  He's pretty likable.

This is one of my favorite movies of the year.  Reminds me of ""Crash"" and ""Traffic"" or even ""Gosford Park,"" complex movies of substance and ambition.

5255382,5,B0093DFMJ4,This movie is like three mini movies that all tie in together. The final act makes the movie come full circle. I find it very sad that I see people giving this movie 1 stars. That is completely ridiculous. Only a brain dead moron would have that kind of an opinion. The acting is perfect from all. The soundtracks are strong. Very heart felt and thought provoking story. You actually have to think when watching this movie. Not like all the other crap you see nowadays from hollywood. This is NOT an action movie but if you have at least a half of a brain then buy it. This is the best movie of 2013.,1376611200,2,600,4.226086956521739
5255383,1,B0093DFMJ4,"I kept waiting for the story to move forward coherently; it never did. The protagonist is killed off too soon, leaving a vacuum that a less-appealing protagonist (Cooper) has to fill. It's not Cooper's acting, which is always solid, it's that he has to 1) fill Gosling's shoes and 2) try to make us care about his amazingly poor quasi-Serpico mini story. The only time this conceit has been done well is in Psycho. This writer couldn't carry Hitchcock's lunchbox. The pace is slow, as if the director feels the material should be treated with gravitas; when, in fact, most of the characters are ill-defined. People with great talent (Rose Byrne, Ray Liotta, oh, and Ryan Gosling) are dropped left and right. I could go on and on, but why waste the time.",1376611200,3,753,4.669172932330827

The performance at the box office was underwhelming for a Ryan Gosling/Bradley Cooper film, but this wasn't a big blockbuster type movie.  It was beautifully written, beautifully shot, and wonderfully acted--everyone churned out a fabulous performance...and what about Ben Mendelsohn! I want to see him in more American movies.  I like his face.

I really didn't get the criticism of Eva Mendez' performance in this film--she was great.  Her acting was very subtle, as I think that it's the smallest nuances that stand out in a Derek Cianfrance film.  This story is awesome--it doesn't go AT ALL where you expect it to.  It's such a breath of fresh air from all the calculated films in Hollywood nowadays, those films that are written, directed, and acted with dollar signs in mind.  This was art.

5255404,2,B0093DFMJ4,"This is the second film made by Derek Cianfrance after his impressive debut ""Blue Valentine"" which also starring Ryan Gosling.
In contrast to ""Blue Valentine"" which is a contemporary 2 character indy drama, this film is a saga about 2 men spanning
3 generations.
The problems of this film surfaced in its first 5 minutes.
""Spoiler Alert""!
Ryan Gosling dyed his hair blond and played a motorcycle daredevil in travelling carnival.
After one of his performances, he bumped into a woman played by Eva Mendez with whom he had a one night stand a year
ago.  Quickly he found out she had a son as a result and he pursued after her and her baby despite she already had a man
who took care of her and her family.
This first part of the film already looked contrived and indifferent for the viewer towards this unsympathetic character.
To make the matter/film worst, he became a bank robber attempting to lure the woman and baby back.
During one of his failed robbery, he was chased by a young rookie cop played by Bradley Cooper who shot and killed him.

(Exit Ryan Gosling who quickly becoming a boring actor to watch and entering Bradley Cooper who managed to shine at least
during his rookie cop years.)

The story then switched to this rookie cop involving stolen money, drugs, police corruption and set ups.
Luckily this cop's father was a prominent judge who mentored and supported him.

All of this is so cliche.

The screenwriters seemed to run out of storyline to tell, so they came up with the ""Fifteen Years Later"" Act 3,
about this rookie cop becoming a lawyer running for district attorney and the relationships between his son and his high school classmate who
happened to be the son of the robber that his father killed.
After the robber's son found out who's the killer of his father, he tried to gun down his father's killer.

So, what's the place beyond the pines?  Nothing worth watching or caring!

5255418,4,B0093DFMJ4,"The Greeks believed that fate controlled us. Oedipus tried to escape his fate by taking certain actions, which, ironically, led him directly into the path of his ordained fate. My initial viewing led me to think fate was the controlling factor here, too. But not so. The characters try to change their fates, their futures and some are successful.

Why the title? ""The Place Beyond the Pines""-- what's there that gives the film its title? A friend, a grounding, a source of history, some explanations, each an essential element of the story of Luke (Ryan Gosling, a superb actor), a daredevil carnival motorcycle rider, and his son Jason. The story covers about seventeen years in a hop-skip fashion and comes in three distinct acts: Luke the bank robber, Avery the police officer who changes Luke's future, and their two sons who intersect as teenagers.

(One note at this point: Gosling always plays the dangerous bad boys, Cooper the wide-eyed heroic types. Wouldn't it be interesting to see a role reversal here? Can Gosling lose his edginess to play the solid, stand-up guy? Can Cooper disguise those innocent eyes to be edgy?)

The film comes in three acts: Gosling as an irresponsible man, father, bank robber; Cooper as hero by quirk--or intention--of fate, momentary dirty cop, politician; and the intersection of their two sons 15 years later to move the fates forward.

The most interesting point of the film is seeing how Avery Cross's son turns out--and it's not pretty. What the viewer learns in Act Two is that Cross (Cooper) cannot look at his son after Act One (I am deliberately avoiding revealing important information). So he grows up neglected--and wow, what an obnoxious, malicious young man he is. On the other hand, Luke's son is just a typical boy, product of a family that stayed together, although he knows nothing about his birth father.

Just as Luke found himself a new mode in ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Jason (his son) learns about his father from the same source. It's a place like the fig tree: safe but full of danger. Luke partook of danger, Jason took a little knowledge.

""A Place Beyond the Pines"" is definitely worth seeing, worth the money, but I want to ask more of the actors, the director. Do Cross and his son really change in Act Three. Do people in general really change? And Jason: Why doesn't he keep the photo? Does he divorce himself from his old life and head out into a new future, a new destiny? That photo initiates new potentiality. It's an abrupt but fascinating ending, one of those that make you create your own ending.",1376352000,13,2581,4.762863534675615

5255420,4,B0093DFMJ4,"One of the better movies of 2013, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" tells a tragic tale of family, honor, dishonor, loyalty, and karma.  The movie opens with Ryan Gosling trying to reconnect with his previous girlfriend (very well played by Eva Mendez).  Trouble is, she's already ""connected"" with someone else, even though she still probably loves him.  Gosling finds out--almost by accident--that he fathered a child, and decides to quit his local job on the carnival circuit as a motorcycle daredevil to provide for his child.  Out of work, out of money, and pretty desperate, he hooks up with his father (I think) who convinces him it is his destiny to help him rob banks.  They have their plan pretty well oiled out, until (naturally) there's a chink in the armour, and things begin to unfold in a way I never saw coming.

That is all I'm going to give away as far as the plot, because to give anymore away would be ruinous to the film.  I will say, however, that this film proves that it isn't always the good guys who win.  In life, you'll find more than likely, the bad guys seem to win.  Karma may bite some people on the a $ $, but it isn't always the right people.  Watching this film made me think about how many people who are pigeonholed into a certain group of people...and they do not belong there at all...yet, try as they might, they cannot rise above things.

""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is an excellent film.  It stars Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendez, Ryan Gosling, and Ray Liota.  Running time is 141 minutes, and it is rated R for language and violence.  Definitely worth watching.",1376352000,2,1594,4.527972027972028

On the surface a cautionary tale that would entertain anyone. Great action AND great acting. But, this story takes it's place with the greats in my book. It makes a deeper statement and stays with you long after you've watched.

At moments jarring, this movie will surprise you. More importantly it will respect you. Never spelling anything out & instead relying on the actors to bring you into the story. They were each subtle & fantastic. Great job to all involved. I feel grateful. How odd, I am not sure I have ever felt this way about a piece of art or literature.",1376092800,,999,4.76878612716763

I was very taken aback by all of their performances, although not surprised. All are great thespians. I really enjoyed the general timeline of this film, the shots, cinematography...and twists.

5255441,4,B0093DFMJ4,"I am going to give this movie 4 stars because it wasn't fo lack of effort that it fell short. This film sort of reminded me of a film by Quentin tarrantino because it was like a bunch of small stories made into 1 long movie. I almost gave it 3 stars because my heart aches and hurts a little because they only *spoiler alert* had ryan goslin in the film for less than the first half. I think the film would have been 5 stars if they could have somehow given ryan g. a bigger part. Even though iknow the whole heartwrenching plot was because of what happened to him. Still I can't help but think some good rewriters good have spruced this film up from a 3 star film into a 5 star film. I really do think this film had a lot of potential  and personally I would give it a 3 because I don't like sad films or when they write out a main character unless it's only to come back later (sort of like Sherlock holmes, or recently like michelle rod in fast n furious). I like action adventure , happy endings, romance, but most importantly the good guy winnind and bad guy losing with a happy ending like I said. But here it's almost like a half a$$'d attempt at turning real life into a happy ending. Real life sucks and we watch movies to live if only for a short while in a land that we wish we were apart of. For those who love this film I simply adored the complexity of tying everyone's lives together. It was simple, predicatable but yet entertaining. I think that ryan goslin by far made this movie what it is. My point is just that it's ashame that they could not have allowed him somehow to be in the entire film * Spoiler( But I get it. His memory lives on through his son and that the ""happy ending"" we are all so magically supposed to arrive at by watching him ride off into the sunset. Be a little more creative. Show his son come back on the same road 10 years later like all ninja on a bike meet a girl like eva mendes his own age, they go on a bank robbing spree, get away with it, get the da to confess to a wrongful death (bradly cooper) and then ride off into the sunset. It also just seemed the movie was a little incomplete  thus falling short of a Hollywood blockbuster. But like I said good try and nice effort therefore I give you a 4 instead of a 3. I mean the title says it all. They try to make an action packed motorbike movie into a romantic tragic tale of what probably happens in real life.
  My final thought is that they could have made the first half of the film into 1 separate film and developed it where ryan g gets the girl, or ryan g. goes into coma comes back years later, exposes eveyrthinga nd kicks butt and gets the girl, or son grows up and takes control of everything. I don't know I just think it was too sad for me but for those who don't mind sad films this was you will definitely like! Thanks for reading! God bless

5255445,4,B0093DFMJ4,"'The Place Beyond The Pines' is the Indian word for Schenectady, NY, where the film takes place. This film has three story lines, and it is not until you are in the midst of the film that realization sets in.

Ryan Gosling stars as Luke, a motorcycle stunt-rider who returns to town and finds he has a baby son, born after a one-night stand. Eva Mendes is his girlfriend and their chemistry sizzles. She understands he is not the steady man she yearns for. But, Luke wants to try and be the father he always wanted. Unfortunately, things don't always work out like you wish they would.

In the second part we meet Bradley Cooper, who plays Avery, a rookie cop. He becomes a hero within his department , and then faces the first real test of his career. He also has a son, but is unable to be the father he wishes. His career advances until he is running for the State Attorney General.

The third part occurs fifteen years later, when Luke and Avery's sons become friends at high school. Avery's son is a druggie, and Luke's son seems to be looking for himself. Neither does the right thing.

The three cycles of this film are not centered. There seems to be a big hole. The first story with Luke is the most fulfilling, anything after Ryan Gosling is a let down. The second cycle is important but drags, and we can guess the result. The third cycle for me was redundant and not needed. Gosling stole the show, and I can't help but wonder if he had to sit everyday while those tattoos were drawn onto his body. The film as a whole is excellent, but at 140 minutes much too long.

5255456,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Our lives are interwoven by thin threads of chance, choice, and circumstance. The Place Beyond the Pines is one interpretation based on several perceptions of the interweaving of these often unpredictable and unforgiving threads. We take so much for granted in our self-centered lives; including the impact each of our choices has beyond what we choose to see and accept as the microcosmic scope of our lives. Chance encounters are more than static point-in-time events. In fact, each event places us at the nexus of a series of infinitely forked roads; each option in direction representing a possible circumstance. If we're conscious, paying attention, and thinking, we give ourselves the opportunity to consider scenarios and consequences. But in the full fight of life, we react and embrace regret before we consider the potential of our choices and actions to irrevocably ripple through time. The film's message is not new, but presents a refreshingly optimistic outcome that encourages us to remember that we can change the way the threads interweave. We're not victims of fact, fiction, fate, or chance. We're empowered to weave each thread as loosely or as tightly as we choose, and in doing so present ourselves with positive circumstances that define or redefine our lives, and the lives of those around us.

5255458,5,B0093DFMJ4,"Derek Cianfrance and Ben Coccio have devised a story that is so engrossing the almost 2  hour cinematic version seems short. They created a screenplay with Darius Marder that embraces so many current questions of deciding what is right and wrong and turned the script over to the talented Derek Cianfrance to direct. It is actually three stories in different time frames so that we can study the effects of fathers on sons and how the seeds of the past bloom into bizarre hothouse blooms, rank with malodorous overtones but holding stamens of considered convictions.

The film opens in a tacky carnival in Schenectady, NY (the Native American word for `the place beyond the pines') where we meet a mysterious, tattooed and mythical motorcycle racer, Luke, (Ryan Gosling) drives out of a traveling carnival globe of death and whizzes through the backstreets of Schenectady desperately trying to connect with a former lover, Romina, (Eva Mendes) who recently and secretly gave birth to the stunt rider's son Kevin aka Jason but is now living with Kofi (Mahershala Ali). In an attempt to provide for his `new family', Luke quits the carnival life and with the inspiration from a casual mechanic friend Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) commits a series of bank robberies aided by his superior riding ability. The stakes rise as Luke is put on a collision course with an ambitious police officer, Avery Cross, (Bradley Cooper) looking to quickly move up the ranks in a police department riddled with corruption as headed by Deluca (Ray Liotta). Cross is married (Rose Byrne) and has a son, neither of whom stands a chance for affection in Avery's big plan for his future. The sweeping drama unfolds over fifteen years as the sins of the past haunt the present days lives of two high school boys - Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen) - wrestling with the legacy they've inherited. The only refuge is found in the place beyond the pines.

The cast is uniformly excellent, able to make unlikable characters into three-dimensional people about whom we learn to care and understand. This is a tough film for many, but is one of the stronger emotional drams of the year to date. Grady Harp, August 13",1376006400,,2184,4.849865951742627

5255463,5,B0093DFMJ4,"I am a fan of ""The Gos""(Ryan Gosling). I admit I even tried to emulate him in ""Drive"" and ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". He is a great actor and he always seems to make great movies whether they are mainstream or independent. He has already received recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"". I was excited to see what character he would bring to life next when I heard about this movie. I saw the running time of 140 minutes and saw the trailer. I wondered how they were gonna make a movie of Gosling and Cooper last that long without dragging. Then I found out that Gosling is only in the first third of the movie despite him being the face of the movie. At first I felt disappointed, but I got over it because I know that isn't a way to judge a movie. So I went in after hearing mostly praise for this gem of a film.

If most of you haven't already figured out, the movie is divided into 3 acts. The first follows Luke(Gosling) a motorcyclist from a traveling carnival who quits upon finding out he has a son. He struggles to provide for the son Jason, who's mother Romina(Eva Mendez) is now with another man. He resorts to robbing banks. These actions lead into the Second act which follows Avery(Bradley Cooper) after he has a traumatic run in with Luke. Avery, a cop who also has a son, is struggling with corruption within the police station. Soon he finds a job as the Assistant DA. The third act takes place 15 years later. Now Luke and Averys sons Jason and AJ are teenagers. Soon they become frenemies. All of the actions from the first two acts collide into a dramatic finale. That is just the gist of the plot.

The first act was emotionally tense. This was also the best of the three acts in my opinion. Each act was like a mini movie. But this act could have been expanded into a separate movie if possible! It was intense, the dialogue with Ben Mendelsohns character was great. Ben Mendelsohn should really be recognized for Best Supporting Actor here. Gosling gives a great performance as an Outlaw type, but also a caring man who just wants to provide for his son.

The second act featured less of the emotion from the first act and more of the crime aspect of the movie. For a second I thought Martin Scorcese had taken over the script. That is a compliment. Cooper also does great acting here! At first you will hate his character, but as you realize what is going on, you will almost forget about the first act and now focus on the story of Avery!

The third act seems to be getting the least praise. I am confused with that. Some are saying it was unneeded. I strongly disagree with those opinions! This was the perfect way to end this story! Many people are complaining that it was too clich to include this part. It wasn't as good as the first two acts, but it was still great. The fact that the two sons meet and become friends is intriguing. It makes you wonder what will happen scene after scene. Great climatic ending to the movie!

The directing is top notch. This movie is beautiful to watch. It did what movies that use an overload of CGI mostly can't do. It told a genuinely good and tension filled story. I do like some movies with some good CGI, but I love movies that don't rely on special effects even more! The acting was stunning from all members of the cast. Its hard to choose a best actor between Gosling and Cooper, but there is no doubt in my mind that Ben Mendelsohn did a magnificent job in his supporting role! The story of this movie is gut wrenching. Its a drama. Its a crime drama. Its a thriller. Its even a R rated High School movie in the final act at times. It is a modern epic tragedy. It is a tale of karma and decisions. I personally think it is much better than Director Derek Cianfrances last film with Gosling ""Blue Valentine"". This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout, especially in the third act. Again regarding the third act, I think most people aren't too keen with it because of the way one of the teens talks throughout. I got used to it within 5 minutes though as I thought it was actually a nice touch. The music of the movie is brilliantly placed too. The musical score was haunting and beautiful. The main theme cuts deep especially the way it was used in the film! Stay with the credits to finalize the experience because the song ""The Wolves"" by Bon Iver that plays is a true emotional masterpiece that goes well with the movie that preceded it!

I recommend this movie to anybody that loves a genuinely good original movie. This movie does demand your full attention though. If needed, you might have to put on the subtitles to fully understand some of the less audible dialogue. But that is your personal choice. This is a great movie for men particularly, whether you're a father, a son or both. This movie is great for women too, but men will have a more personal experience with the movie! This movie will stick with you either way!",1375747200,3,4925,4.365321701199564

This is a hard movie to review. I must first start by saying that this was nothing at all like what I expected. I will try and do this without trying to give anything away. The movie is almost like three mini movies in one. First 45 min deals with Luke, then switches to Avery and finally their children. I expected this to be more of a type of cat and mouse movie, it isn't. The movie deals with one event that links and defines not only the two involved but also the families of the robber and cop. This is not a movie you can just put in and watch, this is one that makes you think and wonder who is right and wrong. This is not a movie for everyone and if you are looking for a fast paced action thriller this is not it. This is more of an art house type drama that shows how one decision can change your life.

""The Place Beyond the Pines"" begins with a bang, with an intriguing chapter featuring ever-charismatic Ryan Gosling, but loses momentum in its mid-section where familiarity creeps in.

Ryan Gosling plays Luke Glanton, a stunt motorcycle rider of a traveling carnival. When Luke learns that he is a father of a son from his former lover Romina, (Eva Mendes), he quits the job and stays in the town. But Romina just does not want him around. Luke then gets involved with local bank robberies.

This is where a police officer Avery Cross enters the story. Now, both Luke and Avery have a son. About fifteen years later, Luke's son Jason (Dane DeHaan) and Avery's son AJ (Emory Cohen) meet each other, not knowing what happened to their fathers in the past.

The cast all did a superb job, especially Ryan Gosling who appears only in one-third of the film. The film maintains a slow pace and low-key atmosphere throughout, but when things happen, they tend to be brutal and violent. Also, there is one great chase scene that alone is worth watching. Great bike stunts are not to be missed.

""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" a crime (or revenge) drama told with the spirit and scale of Greek tragedy, requires patience on the viewer's part. The journey is well worth taking, but except the brilliant opening act the film looks somewhat unfocused, not knowing what it really wants to be.",1371859200,2,1599,4.88929889298893

5255487,5,B0093DFMJ4,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a film with notable story layers driven by the impulses of key characters who are often good at heart but find themselves corrupted by gaining unlawfully.

Duplicitous acts subtly define the narrative with consequences which appear ended only to resurface with new and significant impact.

It is very much a movie where moral right becomes swallowed by the convenience of self-preservation and ruthless promotion, yet amongst all the miscarriages of honesty one character is able to find a missing piece of his life and deal head on with the person who changed it so dramatically.

The cinematography takes the viewer there during several dramatic scenes and film characters are strongly presented with meaningful acting which gives the story greater authenticity.

About 50 minutes into the film, we are introduced another main character, policeman Avery (Bradley Cooper). Then act three start about 40 minutes later (16years or so) with all the children grown and only Eva Mendes among the adults looking any older.

The ending is supposed to be heart warming, but doesn't make it. The film is long, but it is not deep. The action moves like a man running with one shoe nailed in place. I never felt for any of the characters. The scene with Bradley Cooper crying was just horrible. That was grade B acting topping off a stiff performance. Gosling on the other hand gave us a strong performance and Mendes was never developed. What was her problem? She wants him, she doesn't want him, she wants him, she doesn't want him.

5255489,4,B0093DFMJ4,"They say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. ""They"" might as well be talking about ""The Place Beyond The Pines.""

This quiet little story revolves around two men joined forever by a single act of violence, and how it affects the people they love. It sometimes feels like it needs severe trimming, but Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling both give very powerful, understated performances -- and Derek Cianfrance is able to provoke the audience's thoughts without preaching to them.

Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) is a wandering motorcycle stunt driver, with no ties to anyone. Then he discovers that his ex-lover Romina (Eva Mendes) has given birth to his son Jason, but Romina has since gotten involved with a new man named Kofi (Mahershala Ali) and doesn't want him around. Desperate to be in his son's life, Glanton teams up with a mechanic (Ben Mendelsohn) to rob local banks, so he can provide for Jason.

But after a fight with Kofi, an increasingly desperate Glanton finds himself robbing a bank alone -- and a tiny delay causes the police to pursue him. Rookie cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) manages to corner Glanton and ends up accidentally killing him.

Though he's hailed as a hero, Cross is racked with guilt because he fired the first shot -- and is even more guilt-ridden when he finds out Glanton had a baby son the same age as his own son AJ. His feelings of guilt and his quest for justice will cause ripples in his life through the years, especially when he runs for Attorney General -- and Jason discovers the tragic truth about his father.

At its core, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a story about having good intentions, but doing things that are bad (or at least questionable) to fulfill them -- one man turns to theft to be close to his son, the other shoots a man to uphold the law. It's a tragic story with no easy answers, especially since it shows us the story's middle-climax from two different viewpoints.

Derek Cianfrance (the guy who brought us the equally tragic ""Blue Valentine"") films the movie in a gritty, realistic style -- no glamour, no overblown soundtrack, no sweeping visuals, no fakey movie dialogue. It gives a strangely intimate flavor to the story, particularly as the camera tends to focus on Cooper and Gosling's faces. It relies completely on the actors to make you feel and empathize, which is a rare thing in movies.

And those actors are more than up to the challenge. Gosling's bleached hair is a bit silly-looking, but he gives a heartrending performance as a man who is changed forever by fatherhood, and who desperately wants to be a better dad than his father was. And Cooper proves he's much more than the ""Hangover"" guy, giving a subtle, tragic performance as a haunted man who discovers that every death is a terrible loss.

The one problemo: it needs tighter editing. Some of the scenes ramble on a lot longer than they need to, such as the scene where Cross is being questioned about the shooting.

""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a beautiful -- if sometimes overlong -- piece of work, resting on the shoulders of two excellent actors. A gritty, well-developed tragedy.",1369958400,2,3147,4.696914700544465

I had been hearing very good things about this movie for a long time and today I finally got to watch it. My oh my what a movie. I have yet to see Man of Steel, American Hustle, or any other movie besides 42 that has really impressed me. But this is already one of the best films of 2013. Ryan Gosling took a big leap from his lackluster performance in Gangster Squad and gave a strong standout performance as Luke Glanton. Supporting cast includes Eva Mendes as Romina, Bradley Cooper(he is getting better with each role as an actor) as Avery Cross, Ray Liotta as Delucca who also did a great job (there has to be a guy everyone loves to hate) and Dane Dehaan (who is also a great actor for his age) as Jason Glanton. The whole cast did a beyond superb job. The Place Beyond the Pines makes you forget that the people in it are just characters; you generally come to care about and understand each and every one of the characters in the movie. I had the same feeling I had watching Cloud Atlas; the connections are there, the story is pretty self explanatory but you have to pay close attention to every detail. The Place Beyond the Pines itself has every emotion a movie like this should have: happiness, tragedy, understanding, etc. You can expect the unexpected with The Place Beyond the Pines. Stellar Cast, Powerful story line, and just an Extraordinary movie.

5255494,4,B0093DFMJ4,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012 release; 140 min.) reunites writer-director Derek Cianfrance with Ryan Gosling after the outstanding and critically acclaimed (but commercially ignored) ""Blue Valentine"" movie of a few years ago.

There is no point in even trying to bring short synopsis of the movie's plot, as this would surely ruin your viewing experiencec, so let me give a few comments and observations instead: first, I had seen the preview of this movie on several occasions, and the impression you get from that is that the movie is about Ryan Gosling's character deciding to rob banks so as to support the baby he never knew he had. That is indeed part of the story, but that covers probably 30 min. into the movie, so what about the remaining 100+ minutes? All I will say is that as it turns out you get three connected mini-movies woven into one epic movie, and I will leave it at that. Second, the scenery in the movie in and around Schenectady, New York, is quite beautiful. I've never visited the area, and I know Schenectady primarily as having a large GE facility, and indeed the GE building in downtown is clearly visible in a number of shots. Third, there are several noteworthy performances, starting with Ryan Gosling (he is in my opinion one of the very best actors around today, does he ever give a bad performance?), but other notables include Eva Mendez as his one-time fling, Ray Liotta as a hard-nosed cop, and Rose Byrne as the wife of Bradley Cooper (look out for Rose Byrne in ""I Give It A Year"", which I saw a few months ago on an overseas trip and will be released in the US later this year). Kudos also for the enjoyable soundtrack (check out Bon Iver's outstanding song ""The Wolves (Act I Act II)"" that plays over the ending credits of the movie).

This movie has been playing in the theatres here in Cincinnati for several weeks now and I was really on the fence about going. But ultimately I gave in. While it is not the masterpiece that was ""Blue Valentine"", ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" was far more enjoyable than I had expected. Shame on that completely misleading preview/trailer! If you are in the mood for something different or a movie where things don't get blown up every few minutes, I can readily recommend ""The Place Beyond the Pines"".",1367712000,3,2284,4.6093366093366095

Prior to reading the Amazon description I was going to write that this film is a 3 Act Film.

Act 1...RG...Act 2 RG and BC Act 3..BC.
The title...The Place Beyond the Pines...make you wonder what this film is all about.

The key actors are Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper and the others are IMO supporting actors.

I can see why in the opening credits that RG and BC are side by side. Each did half a movie.

This a very good movie with an interesting story that could be taken from the headlines of many a newspaper. It's a newspaper story put on celluloid err digital?
All the actors are PRO's at what they do and have a good script to do it in. No need for me to descibe the film. Read the description.

This characters in this film all have heart ...well perhaps with the exception of Ray Liotta...lol. Is there a film that this man has not been in? He is getting scarier by the film. I bet when any film is in the works...the first name that comes up is Ray Liotta.

5255496,3,B0093DFMJ4,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"", the new film from director Derek Cianfrance (""Blue Valentine"") is really two and a half films and one of these is much better than the others, resulting in an uneven, unsuccessful work. I don't like faulting someone for trying too hard, but...

Luke (Ryan Gosling), a tattooed motorcycle stunt driver, looks up an old girlfriend, Romina (Eva Mendes), when the carnival he rides with is back in her hometown. He learns she had a son, his son, during the year he was away, and decides to stick around, despite the fact she is now living with Kofi (Mahershala Ali), her new boyfriend. The only way he feels he can get the money he needs is to start robbing banks, using his superb motorcycle riding skills to elude the law. He takes the money to Romina, but she rejects it. But her attraction to Luke proves to be very strong. Luke decides to amass as much money as possible and present it to Romina as a nest egg, and buy gifts for the baby, so he decides to rob two banks in one day. After the first robbery, Avery (Bradley Cooper), a rookie on the police force, spots him and pursues him on foot into a family home. Avery is wounded in action and becomes a bit of a celebrity. He uses the celebrity to quickly rise through the ranks of his department and eventually runs for public office. Fifteen years later, Avery's son,  AJ (Emory Cohen), and Luke's son, Jason (Dan DeHaan), meet in high school and become friends, unaware of the history their fathers have.

Cianfrance became widely known when his second feature ""Blue Valentine"" began making the circuit. ""Valentine"" features amazing performances from the two leads Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Despite the depressing nature of the story, it is impossible to not watch the actors depict the downward spiral of this couple's relationship. We recognize and identify with various aspects of their lives, but they are living through every bad aspect of a relationship and neither has the ability to make a change, any change, to break this heartbreaking spiral. The film is tragic and riveting, more so because we spend almost the entire film with just these two people. This allows Cianfrance, Gosling and Williams to go to places we don't see a lot and the actors are able to explore the depths of despair in which these two characters live. The narrow scope also allows the director and actors to concentrate on their relationship, to make it as powerful, and interesting as possible.

When someone experiences success at something, he or she usually wants to set their sights on something bigger, to expand their skills, knowledge, risk and reward. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is bigger; more characters, a multi-generational storyline, more going on. The film represents quite a leap forward for Cianfrance, maybe too much of a leap. I applaud Cianfrance for pushing forward, for trying something different, but the development of the characters and the narrative both fall short.

The first part of the film tells Luke's story, concentrating on his relationship with Romina and his efforts to get some money to care for his child. As you watch Gosling, you become a part of his story and it is hard not to get involved with what everyone knows will not be a happy ending.

There is something insanely watchable about Ryan Gosling. It is easy to see why he is so immensely popular; even in his less successful films, you can't take your eyes off him. His charisma just oozes like a young Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford. In ""Gangster Squad"", his recent co-starring role with Josh Brolin was more odd and his Mickey Mouse voice was just distracting from his attempts to act and appear tough. But still, if you decide to spend your time and money to watch the film, you won't take your eyes off the screen when Gosling is present. Better yet, Gosling seems to regularly alternate between big budget studio fare and more challenging independent films, giving him something to do as an actor while making him a household name among two different sets of moviegoers.

What I wasn't expecting was the episodic narrative. It is an interesting idea, and has some benefits, but it isn't handled very well here. Near the end of Luke's story, Avery is introduced and we shift our focus to his life for the next portion of the film. This isn't a commonly used narrative device, but when it works, it works because both actors are engaging, maybe for different reasons, but they both hold your attention.

I am a big fan of Bradley Cooper and have had a huge crush on him from the beginning. I even went to see ""Hit and Run"", director Dax Shepard's (yes, DIRECTOR Dax Shepard's) car chase film, because of his supporting role. I have to say that's the mark of a true fan. I paid for two of the twenty tickets sold for the screening I attended on opening weekend. But he doesn't rise to the level of Gosling's work in this film, which makes his part of the story less interesting and enjoyable.

When the attention shifts again to their two sons, fifteen years later, the story becomes a little more interesting simply because the actors playing their sons are less well-known and there is the feeling we might discover a great new talent, a new star-making performance. I don't think either really gets to that level, but their work seems raw and holds our attention more.

This also points to a flaw in the director's work. A more accomplished director would recognize how powerful Gosling's performance is and try to balance Cooper's work more. This isn't always possible - even Scorsese failed to do this on ""Gangs of New York""; Daniel Day-Lewis completely overshadows DiCaprio and everyone else in the movie - but it helps the overall film when the performances are on the same level. When they aren't, it usually isn't as noticeable. But the episodic narrative makes the imbalance more pronounced.

""Blue Valentine"" is a remarkably good film. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is more ambitious and more flawed. Cianfrance uses a similar visual a few times in the film, but doesn't use this same framing at the very end of the film, when he could and probable should. It seems like a missed opportunity to really send the message home and provide a moment of impact.

Cianfrance clearly has promise and may one day create a beautiful, memorable, haunting film. As the director makes more films, I have no doubt he will continue to add skills and his films will become stronger. He may make some missteps along the way, but he has already established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I will eagerly seek out each new film.",1367366400,9,6602,4.706493506493507
5255497,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Like any language, the language of film is forever evolving. Writer/director Derek Cianfrance seems to be involved writing a new dialect.

Here's the scoop. This three act outing begins with Ryan Gosling as a motorcycle stunt driver in a traveling carnival. When the show hits Schenectady he finds he has fathered a son. He goes to great and illegal lengths to do what he thinks is right by the child and mother. That puts him in harm's way with policeman cum lawyer Bradley Cooper. The story shifts to Brad and his trying to fight a corrupt police force. The story then shifts to the sons of the two men as their paths cross in high school.

I liked Chianfrance's debut piece ""Blue Valentine"" a lot. It was an interesting way to tell a story and contained characters that straddled the fence between likable and unlikable. He does something similar here. Gosling is not a great role model but feels compelled to right a bad situation for which he feels responsible. Likewise, Brad Cooper wants to do good and works with some pretty scummy cops. Yes he heads down the path of the righteous but does great harm to his son and wife in the process. And when the two boys meet, not knowing how their lives are connected, we get to see what they are like in the wake of their fathers.

This is filled with great performances (Ray Liotta will make your skin crawl) and is also written and directed well. This has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. But it has a natural feel to it. You feel you are in the frame with these people. About the only 'con' I can find is that, when it was all over, I wasn't certain what Chianfrance was trying to say. Be good to your kids? I don't know. It was a long ride but I loved every minute of it.",1367193600,,1738,4.3580246913580245

One doesn't enter The Place Beyond the Pines with mild expectations.  In-between its long and deliberate opening, to a surprisingly clean final shot lies a movie embodied by ambition and emotion.  While the three-act structure is divided in a very clear-cut manner, the depictions and characters are anything but.

The innocent way to pitch the film, to borrow a quote from the trailer, is that it's about ""fathers, sons and consequences.""  At the forefront is Ryan Gosling as a stunt-driver, who suddenly finds that he has a son and just as quickly sees his life take several fast turns.  These, in turn, become the backdrop for a majority of the movie's ongoings.

Attention eventually comes to Bradley Cooper, who plays a cop in a nearly unrecognizable performance.  In due time, we're given the shapings of a select few characters, as we see points in their lives shape what they've become, as well as what they will become.

Derek Cianfrance didn't exactly receive soft remarks for his previous film, Blue Valentine.  Likewise, The Place Beyond the Pines doesn't gear itself towards a timid audience.  Climaxes usually stand somewhere in or around the third act of a story, but this one showcases its most intense and gasp-worthy parts nearly an hour in.  From that point, it's tough to let your hands off the armrests or take your eyes away from the screen.  Credit must be given to the script and camera work, both of which play a large part in grounding the movie.  Because of that, we get caught up to the nth degree.

Commentary and study come into play, especially around the second act when the immediate effects of one event ignite more than just a trickling effect.  And while emotion is still gripped and clenched during the final act, some indecisive meandering comes out, which isn't helped by what turns out to be a stereotypical depiction.  It also feels like we miss out on some lingering questions as (part of) the story rides off.  The aforementioned consequences don't all come full swing, and the ending leaves an empty sense of conclusiveness, if that.

Were it not for the problems sprouting out of the third act, The Place Beyond the Pines could've been elevated from great to truly excellent.  But even without an actual sense of finality, one can't deny the occasional blood-pumping and conscience-throbbing intensity that comes with it.",1366848000,,2373,4.885
5255499,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Just when we were really getting to know Ryan Gosling, he's left the building.  That's right, folks, Mr. Gosling has decided to take a break from acting.  Much like Channing Tatum, Ryan Gosling has recently caught on with film-goers and has been the subject of heartthrob mania - mainly since he graced the big screen as the lead in 2004's The Notebook.  But, is this the right move for Gosling?  Has he already been overexposed to the general public?  If anything, he has even broken the barrier to stardom.  Gosling is clearly a well-rounded actor, but this could be a suicidal career move, especially since he was just finding his audience, with films like Drive, The Ides of March, and Gangster Squad.  However, these films are far from box office breakout performances for Gosling.  He's right on the cusp of being the next ""big thing"" in Hollywood - but suddenly he needs a break.  Oh well.  What's the saying?  To each his own?  In any event, The Place Beyond the Pines could very well be the last we see of Ryan Gosling for a while.

Directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine), The Place Beyond the Pines stars Ryan Gosling as Luke Glanton, a motorcycle stuntman that happens to visit his ex-lover, Romania (Eva Mendes), only to discover he's the father of her child.  Determined to provide for the child, Luke begins robbing banks, but is eventually stopped by a rookie police officer, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper).  Flashing forward several years, Cross is running for Attorney General, while both Cross' and Glaton's sons wind up becoming friends in high school, unaware of the past between their fathers.  Dane DeHaan, Emory Cohen, Rose Byrne, Bruce Greenwood, and Ray Liotta also star in supporting roles.

The Place Beyond the Pines is quite simply one of the most well-written dramatic plots in quite some time.  Pines is an ambitious film, to be sure - and what makes it so dramatically fulfilling and entertaining is the fact that it doesn't try to do more than it should with what it has.  It's a simple story about two men, Glanton and Cross, and how their lives are destined to be intertwined with one another based on the choices that these two men make for themselves.  Like most films should be, Pines clearly differentiates itself over the course of a three-part act.  Gosling, Cooper, and the tandem of DeHaan and Cohen, each tell their own stories in order to bring the film full circle.  One by one, you'll get to know these characters and understand their reasoning behind the choices they make, due in large part to the superior dialogue and prompt direction.  There absolutely isn't enough praise for the direction from Derek Cianfrance, who also co-wrote the script, along with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder.

As far as the acting goes, it's not as if there's really one specific actor that steals the show.  Even though Gosling and Cooper both portray their characters to the best of their abilities, you can't help but question some of the choices these characters make.  For instance, Gosling's character instantly gives up his job to help support his child?  How is he supposed to support his child if he gives up his job?  Bradley Cooper's character shoots a perp, yet lies about who shot first (Cooper's character did) - as if a perp pointing a gun at a police officer without firing is not enough justification to shoot first.  We might as well call this the Han Solo/Greedo conundrum redux.  Still, with these issues aside - Pines is really gets its breakout performance from new comer, Dane DeHaan.  His buzz-worthy performance as a loner searching for answers about his father is just the beginning of a soon-to-be busy movie career for young Mr. DeHaan.

Overall, the small town setting in The Place Beyond the Pines is beautifully sculpted and perfectly captured to fit the demands of its story and characters.  This is a character driven film with a series of twists, all of which lead up to the climactic grand finale.  Rest assured, Pines is absolutely worth a visit to your local cinema, so if for some reason you're on the fence about seeing this film, you should definitely make it a priority before the summer juggernauts come to town.

  The film is set in a small New York town in the mid 1980's. Our first image of Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) is a scary one. He's a shirtless tattooed bleached blonde daredevil warming up for his performance by playing with two switchblade knives. The camera follows him from his trailer to a circus tent where he climbs onto a motorcycle before an awaiting crowd and into a ball of death with two other riders. His life is a performance. A series of poses. Each pose is an evocation of cool. And cool only has two faces: not-quite-of-this-world detached and tired-of-this-life weary. And the crowds love it. Especially the kids. He wears a Metallica t-shirt. He's the smalltown carnival equivalent of a rock star. He signs autographs after each show. But he only has those two poses/attitudes and they pretty much define this character who seems to look right through this world as if there's nothing in it for him. He's a mesmerizing presence. Every second he's onscreen in his eighties bleached hair and jeans and torn t-shirts and knife-with-tear tattoo is electric. But thats all the world sees. And maybe thats all he sees too until he finds out he has a child by a local girl named Romina (Eva Mendez). Only then do we get a glimpse of what's beyond the image. When he sees his child we realize that this daredevil can be man-angel sweet and charmingly funny. But we also realize that this daredevil charmer can also be an ice cold sociopath when he feels threatened or when things do not go his way and they almost never do. Romina is a realist, she works in a diner, and she figures out pretty quick that Glanton as hard as he might want to believe he can make this work is not daddy material. Regardless of her perception, he seems to think he is and so he quits the carnival gig and decides to stick around and convince her that they can be a family. Unfortunately for Glanton, his skill set is limited, all he really knows how to do is ride his motorcycle and it is while trail riding that a local schemer spots his unique talents. Eventually the two begin robbing banks. Glanton in his twisted way thinks this is a way to prove to Romina that he can be a provider. The bank robberies are intense. Especially the mororcycle getaways. They give us a chance to see just how desperate Glanton is to make a normal life for himself. But before that normal life can begin, the law catches up to him. Once he realizes its over he phones Romina and requests that she never tell his son about him. In his final moments it's as if he is willing himself out of existence. The look on his face as the camera pulls away from it for the last time is mysterious: Glanton's expression is not of a guilty man who knows his time is up but one of a proud father. The expression will haunt the cop who killed him for the rest of his life. There was only one place where Luke Glanton was at peace with himself and at home in the world, and that was racing on his motorcycle through a forest of pine trees. The other thing that made him happy was holding his child.

Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) is the cop who caught up to and killed Glanton (perhaps needlessly) and he is the center of the second part of this three part film and he too has a young son the same age as Glanton's and he's haunted by what he's done. It certainly doesn't feel heroic. But he's a guy with too much education to be a blue collar cop all his life. And he knows it. So he uses what leverage he has (his hero status and his knowledge of corruption in the department) to wrangle a white collar job that eventually leads to a political career. But because he cannot connect to people (especially not his son) each of these roles are just empty images, surfaces, with nothing beneath. Cross is a man as uncomfortable being human as Glanton was. But he keeps his distance from humanity in a different way--by acquiring power and wealth. The void at the center of his life is simply plastered over with campaign posters. It will take a strange act of revenge that turns into an act of forgiveness to bring him back to life.

In the third act (which takes place 15 years after the first) the teenage sons of long dead outlaw Luke Glanton and ex-cop/now politician Avery Cross meet at their high school. Both of the teenagers are social outcasts (with dads who are either dead or absent) but Glanton's kid has a harder time because like his dad (who he never knew) he cannot find a satisfying role to play; Cross's kid has an easier time of it because, like his dad, he knows how to play the social roles that are available to him. The two bond unaware of the way that their lives (through their fathers) are linked. But Glanton's kid soon figures out who both of their fathers were/are and considers seeking revenge. But doesn't. The last image we have of Cross's son is onstage playing the role of politician's son (a sign that he has reconciled with his father). The last image we have of Glanton's son is aboard a motorcycle riding away over hills surrounded by pines (a sign that he too has reconciled or at least has begun the process of reckoning with his father as well).

Derek Cianfrance (BLUE VALENTINE) directs but this film (or at least the first third of it) looks and feels exactly like Nicolas Winding Refn's nihilist masterpiece DRIVE. The first act of this three act film deserves 4 stars, the second and third acts work fine but are far less inspired and compelling (playing more like a Lifetime movie than an action thriller)-- without Gosling's superstar presence the film just loses steam and drags (like watching your favorite team without the MVP) so those last two acts are more in the 3 star range. If you are a huge fan of DRIVE (and I am) you will love the first act and find the rest of the film slow but worthwhile. If DRIVE didn't do it for you, this one certainly won't either. The soundtrack (which includes nice uses of Springsteen's ""I'm on Fire"" and Bon Iver's ""Wolves"") is fine but nowhere near as compelling as the DRIVE soundtrack.",1366416000,,6105,4.465949820788531
5255502,5,B0093DFMJ4,"Derek Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a hard film to review. I can't help but feel that too many reviewers, both on Amazon and elsewhere, have told too much of the story. This is what I knew going to see the movie: that it starred Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper as antagonistic characters on opposite sides of the law, and that the story took place over a number of years (15, to be exact). I'm glad I didn't know anything more than that, because the surprises Cianfrance had in store for me took my breath away.

You already know the story in detail if you've read any other reviews, but here is what I feel safe in telling you:

1. Gosling, as a daredevil motorcyclist turned bank robber, dominates the first half of ""The Place Beyond the Pines.""

2. Cooper, as a cop turned district attorney, is the main character of the second half, though there are also important plot twists involving Emory Cohen, as Cooper's son, and Dane DeHaan, as Gosling's.

3. All four aforementioned actors are wonderful, as are Eva Mendes, as the love of Gosling's life; Ben Mendelsohn, as Gosling's partner in crime; Ray Liotta, as Cooper's corrupt superior in the police department; Rose Byrne, as Cooper's wife; and Harris Yulin, as Cooper's politically savvy father.

4. Despite the sprawling structure of ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Cianfrance's direction keeps us on the edge of our seats for most of its 140-minute running time. He is helped immeasurably by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt and editors Jim Helton and Ron Patane. The opening sequence, showing a heavily tattooed Gosling swaggering his way through a carnival crowd, is a wow, as is a chase scene in the middle of the movie between Gosling and Cooper.

5. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" reminds me of some of the great old TV miniseries, such as ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" and ""Captains and the Kings."" The thrust of its story, however, is as old as the Bible, with the fathers eating sour grapes and the sons' teeth being set on edge. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is messy in its structure, and not every loose end gets tied. But it is powerful and moving, and I think its reputation will grow with the years.",1366416000,,2168,4.6475195822454305
5255503,5,B0093DFMJ4,"The Place Beyond The Pines (2013) - Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Ray Liotta, Rose Byrne, and Eva Mendes.

When a traveling carnival motorcyclist (Gosling) learns that he's a father a year after a one night stand, he flirts with the idea of robbing banks in order to provide for his son. At the same time, an ambitious police officer (Cooper) with a newborn son of his own struggles to stay on the straight and narrow after killing a suspect in the line of duty and being welcomed into a fold of corrupt cops.

The film, by the director of Blue Valentine, is both poignant and meaningful. Ryan Gosling delivers a moving performance and Bradley Cooper proves that his nomination for Silver Lining Playbook was not a fluke but bringing the goods. The supporting cast brings their A game and ultimately realize the promise of a beautifully written script. The story is well done, the direction is wonderful and there are plenty of surprises that leave you truly wondering how this film can end.

Should you buy it? Yes. This film probably won't gain a huge box office weekend, but it is sure to become a classic (cult or otherwise). The performances alone are worth revisiting down the line and it is a must have for fans of indie fair. A worthy addition to any Bluray collection - if only for the shots of characters riding bikes through winding pine covered roads.",1366329600,4,1363,4.647302904564316
5255504,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Ryan Gosling once again blisters the screen as a loner who works as a motorcycle stunt man in a travelling carnival.  Set in Schenectady in upstate New York, Luke (Gosling) runs into Romina (Eva Mendes) with whom he had a brief fling on his visit a year ago.  As it turns out, she and he also have a baby boy.  Previously unaware, Luke decides to stay, get a job and help out financially.  Gumming up the works however is the fact that Romina has moved on and is living with a new man.

Working as a mechanic, Luke is getting little work so he and his boss (Ben Mendelsohn) decide to rob a bank.  They get away with it, but Luke starts getting greedy and decides to go it alone.  He pulls one job too many.  In an unusually authentic chase scene between a couple police cars and Luke on his motorcycle, Luke is finally cornered in a house.  The cop who has found him is a rookie with a law degree (Bradley Cooper).  With another strong performance by Cooper, the film shifts gears as the two men exchange gunfire.  Avery (Cooper), seriously injured is marked as a hero.  But it doesn't sit well with him, especially given that he has a son the same age as Luke and Romina.  Things get more complicated as Avery's police friends harass Romina in an effort to find the cash that Luke had stolen.

The film then jumps ahead 15 years.  Avery has become the District Attorney and is running for Attorney General.  His now 17 year old son A.J. (Emory Cohen) comes to live with him again after a long divorce.  He's a druggie and befriends Jason (Dane DeHaan), the son of, you guessed it, Romina and Luke.

The movie is beautifully shot and logical in its display of events.  It is too long however clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes.  The final act in particular seemed to tell us what we already know.  This is a minor gripe in what is one of the best movies of the year so far.  The film's title comes from the Mohawk translation for Schenectady.",1366070400,2,1945,4.314917127071824
5255505,5,B0093DFMJ4,"I think so many films come out every year that it is unfairly easy to skip the right one when it comes along. I keep sifting through films recently but I never know which one to look out for and trailers are very misleading I have found but here's why I was waiting patiently for this film. Lets run a small preview of the people involved in the film.

PRE-VIEW (How I felt before watching the film)

About the actors and director,

Ryan Gosling (last three films) - Ides of March (2011) , Crazy Stupid Love (2011) , Gangster Squad (2013)
Brad Cooper - Silver Linings Playbook, The Words, Hangover 2
Eva Mendes - *nevermind* but nice mole on lip.
Director - Derek Cianfrance -- Blue Valentine (2010 / Romantic Tragedy)

With such big names and such a bemusing title, I was expecting a film of hard knocks, yet I didn't dare read the storyline because I like to be surprised when the best actors and the best directors get together.

So let me just say that BLUE VALENTINE has been one of the most memorable films of the decade that just left us for me. The transition between characters, the opinions of two lovers in a relationship, the analogy of how it was and how it is, everything about the film was outstanding. I didn't know what hit me when I saw that film and it made me a Ryan Gosling fan.

Review :

""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is an experience you aren't going to forget easily. Some films dictate the terms and this is one of those rare films that sets itself apart most beautifully. The introduction of characters was subtle. Personalities were juxtaposed to the plot in a very unusual way. There is so much the director conveys without trying to be over the top. The sets were unforgettable, when the SOUNDTRACK played, I didn't know what hit me. The sets seemed to match perfectly with every wonderfully chosen of American music. The first scene will have you wondering what the heck is happening. It is long, powerful and Drive'esque. (PS -  I didn't like Drive that much)

Eva Mendes is reborn as an actress with the film. I won't say anything about Cooper or Gosling but the music is so well done, the bass turned to the most delicious level which is very becoming of the film - maker. Overall, this was a treat and I am glad I didn't download it and screen it on my computer but took the effort of going to theater. A film well worth owning I might add once the blu ray's out.

Also ACTION addict? Love THRILLERS but feel they're shot shoddily? I say just watch out for this one..

What's the best thing? 2013 is four and a half months old but atleast I have a film of the year already.

PS - Four out of Nine people at the movies walked out.",1366070400,3,2663,4.346774193548387
5255506,4,B0093DFMJ4,"Overall, I liked this movie a lot. I was hoping for it to be perfect, but it's not. Instead of writing anther lengthy review, I came up with it's pros and cons. I want to stress tho, that this is a fictional story that takes place in a real city. If this area was as bad as it is portrayed, nobody would live here, especially me!

Pros:

The basic story is very good. My daughter asked me to name a similar movie and I could not think of any. It is different.

Some exciting action, despite what some people say. The cop chasing the cycle is one of the best ( and ends up being most important) parts of the movie.

Beautiful cinematography. This area really has some nice views, and they took advantage of that.

The entire movie was filmed here and in a neighboring village. No lame Hollywood movie sets as building interiors. The fairground was about 15 miles away, but still close.

Nice soundtrack! love it!

Good casting, except for AJ ( I'm sure he's a great guy, but that accent was ridiculous)

Lots of real people, real tv station, real banks, real hospital, real street names, real fairground.  A treat for those of us who live here. A lot of extras ( IE news reporters and the Senator) were playing themselves.

The DA (played by Bruce Greenwood) has the last name of the real police chief. Nice touch, Mr. Cianfrance.

Cons:

Its very long but that doesnt bother me that much because I still liked it.

AJ's accent ( I mean really, what WAS that?)

Too much  profanity (every other word in parts is overkill)

It makes all of ours teens look bad. They arent. Yes, SOME are, but not all.
Same goes for the police.

The transition between the second and third act is lame, too convenient, and really turned me off for a few minutes. It does redeem itself,however.

They did almost nothing to make Bradley Cooper look older in the end. They did a nice job with Eva Mendes, but not Bradley.

I do recommend this film, but do not come away from it thinking that everyone who lives here is a criminal! Again, it is fiction.",1365984000,17,2029,4.377005347593583
5255507,5,B0093DFMJ4,"this movie is almost like ""crash' with 3 diff characters and their story. 1st the story of the outlaw, then the law, then the youth. this is not really a bank robbing movie like the commercial shows, but more drama then anything else. redemption and the consequences after. this movie is great throughout. recommend highly for those who knows what to expect. ryan gosling fans will not be dissapointed.",1365724800,15,402,4.840579710144928
5255508,2,B0093DFMJ4,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" refers to the Mohawk name for the city of Schenectady, where most of the action takes place. But action, like the Mohawks themselves, is nearly extinct from this ambitious film about the multi-generational influence of fathers on sons. Not only is the action sparse, the actors themselves are not on screen as much as you'd expect from the coming attractions or from the poster. Ryan Gosling disappears about 1/3 of the way into the film, just about the same time that Bradley Cooper finally makes his appearance. And Ray Liotta is barely in 3 scenes.

But the lack of action and the scarcity of named players are not the main problems with this film. The film suffers from an overly ambitious attempt to be epic. Instead, it is merely long. Boorishly long. Too much time is spent on minor details and too little time is spent on the major plot points. You can tell that there was an excellent story here, and perhaps as a mini-series or in the hands of a more craftful director, we'd have a great film.

The director, BTW, is Derek Cianfrance. This is his third film, following ""Blue Valentine"" (2010) that also featured Gosling.  He is clearly without sufficient experience to take on the ambitious agenda that he sets out as a co-writer for the film.

Another major problem is the aging of the characters, who go 15+ years during the film and barely age at all. The only exception is Eva Mendes who does a great job moving from late teens to middle age.

The film is not without merit. The photography by Sean Bobbitt is excellent. His hand held work following Gosling's motorcycle exploits is breath-taking.

And there are contributions by veteran actors like Bruce Greenwood (plays a DA) and Harris Yulin (Cooper's father) who really add to the quality of the film. Two newcomers, Emory Cohen (Coopers's son) and Dane DeHaan (Gosling's son) do a great job, and I can imagine that with a better script or a more focused film, their work would shine.

Bottom line - an ambitious but ultimately a failed film.",1365465600,6,2040,4.681564245810056
