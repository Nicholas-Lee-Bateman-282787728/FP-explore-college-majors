3945683,5,B002LDAC66,I love this film.  It really shows that Joseph was man who loved his wife and her child. So much about Joseph was unknown. The movie shows him to be quiet and strong as well as accepting his fate to be the foster father of Jesus.,1276387200,10,229,3.9782608695652173
3945684,1,B002LDAC66,I have a devotion to Saint Joseph; and I find this depiction to be a poor attempt to tell us his story. This dvd implies an unsure Joseph and Mary. I do not see Mary and Joseph as being in a daze about their predicament. It is precisely why they were chosen and not the rest of human-kind. Stop trying to show our characteristics on their persons.,1262390400,10,347,4.1940298507462686
3945685,1,B002LDAC66,"Devotees of St. Joseph may not like this film because it portrays Joseph as a man resentful he is not the biological father of Jesus.

Surprisingly, the film leaves out events in the life of St. Joseph recorded in Sacred Scripture such as the Presentation of the infant Jesus in the Temple where Simeon and Anna bless the child.

One might have expected the film to include some of the widespread early christian traditions about St. Joseph, such as the flowering of his staff, or Mary's early life as a Temple Virgin, but these are also missing. Instead the film creates a large fictional storyline about Joseph's relatives being assassins. Herod also receives an unexpectedly large amount of screen time.

On the positive side, the actress who plays Mary does an admirable portrayal, and the actor for Joseph is well cast, although the script sends him in unexpected directions. The sets, costumes, and score are well done. Sadly, any special effects for angels are completely missing; there is no depiction of an angel in the film other than a voiceover.

At the Finding in the Temple, when Jesus tells his parents He had to be about His Father's business, Joseph is visibly disgruntled at not being Jesus' exclusive father. His relationship to Jesus includes doubt (""During the sacrifice I was filled with doubts about our son""), frustration (""Aren't you listening to anything I say?""), and desires of usurpation (""Sometimes I wished you were *my* son""). Joseph has a heart attack on the way back to Nazareth, where he eventually dies with his assassin cousin at his side.

Devotees of St. Joseph may enjoy some scenes from the film, but ultimately it does not do justice to Joseph the Just Man.",1262217600,8,1699,4.844827586206897
3945686,4,B002LDAC66,"Some events were fictionalized, because the New Testament doesn't give much detail about Joseph's life, but there was nothing that was not at least possible.  The actress playing Mary was exquisite, and Joseph was as masculine and protective as we could wish.  Well worth adding to your library.",1261872000,4,295,5.125
3945687,5,B002LDAC66,"This is a fine film on St. Joseph, one I have watched a few times now, and its clear to me that the previous very negative anonymous reviewer named ""Customer"" has either some kind of ax to grind, or simply does not have a clue about who St. Joseph really was, or what the Church & Scripture teach about him and his relationship to Our Lady.

I am a Catholic and I approached this film very critically as I have a strong devotion to and deep respect for St. Joseph. I was surprisingly pleased to see a wonderfully manly and noble performance by actor Tobias Moretti, whose strong & appealing portrayal has the right and tricky combination of being a man who is a devout Jew (""of  David's line""), a ""just man"" as Scripture calls him (as does Mary in this film), a hard-working & excellent carpenter, who has a chaste love for Mary, and who struggles spiritually & emotionally to deal with the great mysteries confronting him regarding the divine conception of Mary's baby and the Incarnation of the Son of God. He has to be instructed several times by an Angel to understand and follow the mysterious plan of God at various stages, and he listens and obeys. He also understands and and does all he can to protect the Christ child from threats to his life. All of this is very well portrayed in the film, and is clearly based on the events from Scripture.

Regarding the ""doubts"" of Mary's virginity, that of course is clear in Scripture that Joseph did indeed naturally question how she could be pregnant without another man being involved, and was therefore planning to do the ""just"" act and divorce her quietly (instead of having her stoned as was often the case then for adultery). It was only when the Angel revealed to him that the child was conceived by the power of God that he came to understand, and accept that mystery. And why wouldn't a mere mortal man (born with original sin like us) with deep love for his spouse lose his temper when he hears she is pregnant ?  This guy was no wimpy man. His strong emotions show how much he deeply cared for Mary.

Regarding the issue of ""labor pains"",  the Church has no definitive teaching on whether Mary had labor pains or not. One is free to take it either way. That is something that has had great theologians and saints on both sides of the debate, but ""labor pains"" do not mean that she was not pure or that Christ was not God.  After all, she suffered greatly in her life (""a sword shall pierce your heart"" said Simeon to her) and of course her Son suffered incalculably in his passion & death.  Suffering (like labor pains) don't mean you are not close to God - often those closest to God suffer greatly, and willingly.

Regarding Joseph possibly having any ""worries"" or doubts"" about his foster son, we know that Joseph had to struggle with the divine mystery of who his son was, and like us had to grow in his understanding of this mysterious person who was both God and man. But the film clearly shows that while he has to grow in that faith and understanding, at the same time he accepts the mystery and deeply loves Jesus.

And finally Mary does not ""despair"" in the film when they lose the their child for three days. That just doesn't happen. She of course is greatly concerned, but never says she ""despairs"". While they both search earnestly for the child, she does say we must ""pray and trust in the Lord"" to help them find the child.

After watching the film a few times I liked it better each time. As I say, Tobias Moretti was outstanding in the lead, and I also really liked Stefania Rivi as Mary, another obviously difficult role to pull off right. I think she presented the right combo of feminity, beauty, purity, spirituality, humility and a deep faith in God. The cinematography, and the music score, are wonderful as well.

Highly recommended !",1259971200,51,3821,4.482014388489208
3945688,5,B002LDAC66,"I don't know what the agenda of the previous reviewer might be but this film has received good reviews from two very Catholic sources that I trust completely.  One is Steven Greydanus, the film reviewer for the National Catholic Register.  If you need a truly Catholic weekly newspaper, the Register is the one (please do not confuse it with the National Catholic Reporter which is not a good source for authentically Catholic information).  The other is Carl Olson.  Carl is a formerly anti-Catholic convert who is now a decidedly Catholic author and speaker.  He runs Ignatius Insight, the Ignatius Press blog.  For my money you can't go wrong with a recommendation from either of these men.  The following are quotes from them regarding this film:

""Tobias Moretti is appealing and manly as the foster father of Jesus, and Stefania Rivi makes a fine Virgin Mary... Joseph and Mary's relationship is well handled, and the film follows Catholic tradition in depicting Jesus' ""brethren"" as the nephews of Joseph. The Annunciation scene is well done.""
-- Steven Greydanus, National Catholic Register

""The movie captures well the humanity of a man who had to grapple with the great mysteries of the Incarnation, the divine conception of Jesus, and the Virgin Birth. Joseph of Nazareth is quite good. The lead performance by Tobias Moretti, a highly acclaimed European actor, is excellent. The movie makers demonstrate a very good grasp of the historical context and details. I think this is a fine movie for the entire family--Catholic, Protestant, and otherwise--wishing to appreciate more deeply the humanity and holiness of St. Joseph, the ""Man Closest to Christ."" And, if I might say so, the accompanying booklet is filled with a lot of helpful and fascinating information (about St. Joseph).""
--Carl Olson, Author, The DaVinci Hoax",1258848000,28,1835,5.110367892976589
3945689,1,B002LDAC66,"JMJ

This film is actually the same film that is put out by a Protestant company in a series entitled Close to Jesus.  I have no IDEA why Ignatius (a ""Catholic"" company) would want to re-market this film, due to its blasphemous content:

1. in this film, St. Joseph doubts the Blessed Virgin's ""virginity""
2. in the above mentioned scene, St Joseph looses control of his temper and violently smashes objects nearby (he also looses control of his temper in a couple of other scenes)
3. the Blessed Virgin is shown to have labor pains
4. the Blessed Virgin rebukes St. Joseph for putting ""false hopes"" into the child Jesus about ever returning to Nazareth
5. St. Joseph claims to be worried about his foster-son and has his doubts about Him.
6. St. Joseph does not pay attention to the sacrifice in Jerusalem, as he is too busy thinking about the problems with his son.
7. the Blessed Virgin Mary is shown to 'despair' when she and Joseph loose their son when leaving the Temple.

Now, to a Protestant, none of the above will mean much.  But to ALL Catholics, this should be considered serious reasons as to why they should not view this film.  I am not going to explain why the above should set off warning bells -- but if anyone would like to know the answer then I suggest they talked to a holy and learned priest, and meditate on the issue.

3945690,1,B002LDAC66,One of the if not the worse Christians films I have ever seen.  It's not even biblical based.  It's as close to blasphemous as you could get.  I don't not recommend this movie at all.,1423612800,2,183,4.171428571428572

3945699,5,B002LDAC66,"Since Pope Francis himself recommends a sincere devotion to St. Joseph, and men of our day and age are looking for a good role model, The life of Joseph is an excellent choice.  God the Father himself chose Joseph to be His human replacement as Jesus' foster father.  Joseph of Nazareth gives a good idea of how the family of Nazereth may have lived in that time before the publis life of Jesus.  The only problematic scene is the one of Joseph being the person who worked on the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, but who can say one way or the other.  Herod would have wanted the best artisans in the whole country and he would have been ruthless in his methods of getting the people to work for him , but that is the only fault I have with this story.  The Temple was truly precious to the Jewish people and they would have been willin; and eager even, to work on the Temple for the restoration under Herod.",1399680000,5,905,4.269005847953216

Through a bit of artistic license we get to know Joseph a bit better as little is said about him in the Bible. I saw nothing to contradict scripture and we see a warm and loving Father who will do anything to protect his son. I would highly recommend this movie for family viewing.

3945706,5,B002LDAC66,"I very much enjoyed watching this movie about the Holy Family. Even though there have been several really excellent ones, including The Nativity, this one takes it from a slightly different angle. We see more of Joseph than we usually do. We also see much more about King Herod and his sons.

The scriptures are pretty much quiet about Joseph. There is much we don't know. Joseph doesn't speak in the scriptures as far as I can remember. We know he was important during the childhood of Jesus. This was a gentle story exploring how it might have been.

I've traveled in the area around where Jesus was born and traveled from Bethlehem to Egypt. The locations used for the movie seemed realistic, even the differences in the terrain. Often movies show it all as the same type of desert, when there are huge differences. This movie showed as they traveled, transitioning from one type terrain to another as they reached Egypt. I appreciate that attention to detail.

One of my favorite scriptures in the Bible is Luke 2:19: ""But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.""

There were more than a few moments when I realized there were tears in my eyes, usually happy tears. The story was artfully told.  Some of it is as we might suppose it would have been, since we weren't there. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves the story of the birth of Jesus.",1331337600,10,1380,4.57085020242915

As a story it is fine and better then what Hollywood usually puts out, so as the story yes.. very good. But since I don't think it is truthful... not.  Acting could have been much better too.
