5274013,5,B0096PBD2O,"Backwards is a charming, upbeat story with heart and substance. Whether you're a sports aficionado, a fan of romantic comedy or a devotee of James Van Der Beek, you'll find something to love. I found it so refreshing to see such a solid female cast - led by the talented Sarah Megan Thomas in her big screen debut. Backwards is ""Bend it Like Beckham"" for rowing. It brings excitement and dramatic tension to the often unappreciated rigors of this sport. After watching the exquisitely filmed racing scenes I now have a much deeper appreciation for the passion and commitment rowing inspires for so many young athletes. Coming so soon after the Olympics, this film reminds us of the sacrifices behind athletic accomplishment and the rewards of true sportsmanship. The sports theme is only one of several draws. Abi and Geoff (Thomas and Van Der Beek) have great charisma in the movie. The coaching scenes between Abi and ""her girls"" bring you back to high school and the relationships there formed. Some of the best scenes put in stark relief how competition can strain even the strongest of friendships - and how teamwork can overcome even major setbacks. Do see this movie!",1351382400,15,1174,4.845771144278607
5274014,5,B0096PBD2O,"Beautifully done!  Family-friendly, too...cinematography for the rowing is excellent.",1436745600,,85,8.444444444444445
5274015,5,B0096PBD2O,"I was a Background Actor in this film I bought it to see myself, but it is a cute movie and story line. It was shot in Philadelphia, PA",1435536000,,135,3.689655172413793
5274016,5,B0096PBD2O,I have a soft spot for sports romance films - both the leads are great.  I really admire the woman who played Susan - I'm guessing she was the athlete trained to act.,1426118400,,166,4.03030303030303
5274017,5,B0096PBD2O,Great movie. If you're a rower.,1407715200,,31,4.333333333333333
5274018,4,B0096PBD2O,"entertaining movie in general, but don't expect much if you are in it for the rowing shots!!!!!",1407369600,,95,4.647058823529412
5274019,3,B0096PBD2O,"Enjoyed the rowing side of things, even though the one actress in the bow was clearly just taught a few weeks prior. Felt the acting was a little stiff and dialogue a little stinted. Otherwise an ok movie.",1401148800,,205,4.421052631578948
5274020,4,B0096PBD2O,Not a great flick but seems to be well accepted by younger athletics.  Story line  is specific to the sport of crew but there is a pompus opinionated mother vs passionate daughter theme throughout,1400544000,,196,4.735294117647059
5274021,4,B0096PBD2O,"Quick Overview: For years Abby Brooks has trained for a spot on the U.S. Olympic rowing team. She misses the mark and is picked for alternate. Again. She decides to throw it in and go home where she makes a run at high school coaching. Her high school flame is the director of sports there. Abby may well be surprised just how much she likes it.

Good family night movie. The plots and themes are clean, simple and innocent. It really builds on the good things like hard work, choices and determination.  What I enjoyed most was watching Abby build relationships with the girls. It helped them and it helped Abby.

I gave it 4 stars because, though it was a nice enough movie, it didn't stand out. I was entertained but I don't see myself searching out for it in the future.",1399939200,,774,4.398601398601398
5274022,5,B0096PBD2O,"A touching story with great music.  I bought it because it was filmed in Philadelphia and having moved away many years ago, I wanted to see the city scenes.  I really enjoyed the movie.  Definitely worth watching.",1397606400,,213,4.702702702702703
5274023,3,B0096PBD2O,"This is a good movie depicting the real world of competitive rowing. Sarah Megan Thomas wrote the story based on her own life experience as a rower and did a fine job.

However, there are some parts of the movie that seem to drag a bit and the acting is 'okay.' Think some of this is due to the fact that there are a number of rowing athletes playing parts in the movie so their acting experience doesn't quite match their rowing abilities.

Still, I would consider it a story worth watching just for the beautiful rowing scenes and to learn more about this sport.",1384041600,2,564,4.3619047619047615
5274024,2,B0096PBD2O,"This should have a ""YA"" in the title.  It is geared toward the 11-12 year old girl.  The acting was so stumbling and confusing that it was downright embarrassing.  The chemistry between the two protagonists was non-existent - almost painful to watch.  James van der Beek seemed confused (and pained at times) as he went through the motions.  Sarah Thomas, (I've forgotten their film names) is a ""young"" woman (turning 30).  After being rejected a spot on the Olympic rowing team she quits and returns home.

Able performances by Glenn Morshower and Margaret Colin are dragged down by Thomas.  She is tentative, gawky, dresses in baggy athletic outfits 90% of the movie and seems relaxed only when working out.  She's so dull (sorry but that's the only word to describe it).  The ""relationship"" between her and van der Beek is of a 7th grade spin the bottle type. She blinks her eyes, smiles, flirts, he gives her a quick kiss on a balcony - you get it.

It's formulaic to the nth degree.  Mom wants a daughter to do girly things (like show an interest in guys), she stumbles but ultimately succeeds as a girls rowing coach, falls for the hero who is dating a cute girl, is offered a last-minute spot on the team but courageously let's her best friend take it, ends up a ""winner"" in life and maybe the hero's girlfriend. It's hard to tell.  Perfect for a middle school slumber party.",1381363200,,1382,4.591836734693878
5274025,5,B0096PBD2O,He is a hunk. She is adorable. Great story. Perfect movie to watch with your kids  loved the scenery and the competitive races and training. Wonderful actors,1377388800,,157,4.814814814814815
5274026,4,B0096PBD2O,Not an epic but a movie that makes you feel good and delivers a good message. Something missing from most films these days.,1373328000,,123,4.391304347826087
5274027,2,B0096PBD2O,Heartwarming story but not much depth to it. The acting is alright but it doesn't really get you involved probably would never watch again. B movie,1372636800,,147,4.6923076923076925
5274028,3,B0096PBD2O,"My daughter rows, so I like any movie about rowing.
Taken on its own merits, it has little to recommend it. Formulaic story, mediocre acting.",1370995200,,141,4.68
5274029,5,B0096PBD2O,"This movie is extraordinarily enjoyable, because everyone in it is believable.  Sarah Megan Thomas is wonderful, and James Van der Beek has finally made me believe he can act.  He is so understated and powerful at the same time.  Glenn Morshower is strong, and the young ladies who play the champion rowers, Hannah and Susan, are fantastic as rowers, and teenage girls.  The story line is enjoyable and has the right twists, and despite any heart-break along the way, the feel good ending is feels great even if it seems predictable...",1367625600,2,535,4.846153846153846
5274030,5,B0096PBD2O,Very well done.. I enjoyed the story and the location of the film. James Van Der Beek was wonderful in it! Great filming shots.,1365120000,,127,4.333333333333333
5274031,4,B0096PBD2O,"If you want a bit of rah, rah you can do it via girls' rowing team, and throw in some romance, typical character internal struggle- what greatness is really about- and put it in a predictable but overall well done format of a movie, then, here you go.

A failed Olympian-to-be woman rower is forced to take less desirable, personal choices in life; however, she discovers unexpected richness in pursuing teaching/coaching with some tough decisions to make.

The film is well shot(Philidelphia backdrop), - the acting realistic with a heroine, Sarah Megan Thomas, who sometimes gets on my nerves with her motives and self-centeredness- true to form.  Jason Van Der Beek(Where's Mrs. Miracle when you need her?) co-stars and does fine as the counter balance and romantic interest.

Yes, it's all kind of by the numbers.  We've seen this before many times, but that's ok.  Good to encourage one to work hard to achieve something. 3 1/2 stars. PG for mild language.  It shows a little drinking.  They include a 'making of' feature which I always appreciate.",1359676800,,1053,4.909604519774011
5274032,3,B0096PBD2O,"Abi Brooks (Sarah Megan Thomas) has been trying out for the Olympics all of her adult life. At age 30, she has been selected as an alternate...again. She decides not to be the alternate and quits, returning to her upscale home in the Philadelphia suburbs. She lands a job at a private school as a rowing instructor from her ex-boyfriend Geoff (James Van Der Beek). She supposedly has trouble adjusting, but it look like she did just fine.

Abi bonds with her students and prepares them for an upcoming match when she suddenly gets a chance to be in the Olympics as a starter. She wants to leave for the Olympics, something that would be a major selling point for the school, but the movie makes her out to be a selfish individual who would rather piddle around as a once in a lifetime Olympic athlete instead of teaching rowing in high school.

Sarah Megan Thomas was all wrong for the part, lacking muscle tone and visible upper body strength. This is a movie to show your kids to let them know how much they ruined your life and dreams, so they better appreciate it.

It is supposed to be a feel good film, perhaps for teachers. 5 stars for after school movie fans.",1359244800,2,1167,4.44392523364486
5274033,5,B0096PBD2O,"I am an elite rower who trained with the national team and was super psyched to see the movie Backwards which features this sport in a much more close up and realistic way than ever before (I mean, we all remember ""The Sculls"" rowing scenarios).  Plus it was fun that the plot not only had a romantic theme, as well as two young girls triumphing in sport, it also showed the main character wrestling with her own journey training for the Olympic team.
Two thumbs up!",1357430400,,466,4.4186046511627906
5274034,5,B0096PBD2O,"Such a Charming film set against the back drop of a female Olympic rowing team...A story carefully constructed hitting all the notes of a Feel Good Film. Sarah Megan Thomas shines as a Fresh Face, Alysia Reiner magnetizes the screen, Alexandra Metz is a driving force and David Basche, with his charming cocky humor adds a bit of spice. And who can forget James Van der Beek?...Who doesn't love a little bit of James...Always refreshing to have a female hero overcome against all odds...Sometimes our biggest enemy is ourselves and if we can surpass that, then sky's the limit.  Its definitely time well spent alone or with the family and a bit of popcorn. ENJOY!",1355702400,,663,4.765217391304348
5274035,5,B0096PBD2O,"This is a great movie.  I rowed in High School and feel that this perfectly captures the sport.  Some people don't understand the dedication that the sport requires, and I feel that this movie shows just how great the sport is. This is a movie I plan on sharing with both my family and team.  Even if you have never rowed, this is a great movie to watch.",1355529600,,354,4.176470588235294
5274036,5,B0096PBD2O,"Backwards is a wonderful film with an important message for teenagers and young adults.  As a mother of two daughters, I appreciated the story of a young woman whose loss of her Olympic dreams sends her into despair; but life turns around in unexpected ways and she learns the values of optimism and perseverance. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the rowing scenes.  It's also terrific to see a movie about a young couple falling in love that doesn't have gratuitous nudity or sex.",1355356800,5,491,4.903614457831325
5274037,5,B0096PBD2O,"The movie Backwards focuses on a women's collegiate rowing but it's so much more.  It's a wonderful, funny, inspiring story that's great for families and a great gift for the holidays for those who are college age plus.  The acting is top notch throughout with Abi (Sarah Megan Thomas) and James Van Der Beek and supporting actors David Alan Basche (the Exes) and Alysia Reiner.  The story was touching and truly inspiring.  But what I enjoyed most is thinking about the movie later and the tough priorities and choices we all make in our lives.
Great film to watch or gift!!",1355270400,,575,4.663366336633663
5274038,5,B0096PBD2O,"As a life-long rower (in competition and for fun), I found the film thoroughly enjoyable.  It is so nice to finally see a film that focuses on the sport that I have loved for many years.  To see its grace and beauty but also keep the realistic nature of the sport was wonderful.  When watching the film in the theater, I found myself surrounded by a lot of high school crews who all laughed and cheered while watching the rowing scenes; scenes to which all rowers, current and former can relate and appreciate.

The movie provides an inspiring story line for young women on pursuing and achieving your dreams by applying some hard work.  There is also a great lesson in there for us older women about sacrifice and choice for what is truly important later in life.

Overall, I was very pleased with the movie and can't wait to see it again.",1355270400,,840,4.457516339869281
5274039,5,B0096PBD2O,"BACKWARDS is a sports film with heart. As a rower, I found the rowing sequences spectacular - better than ""The Social Network!""  But also, as the father of an athlete, I found the film's messages about collaboration and commitment to sport refreshing. Am buying it for my daughter for the holidays! The acting is top notch across the board. A must see film.",1355184000,,357,4.666666666666667
5274040,5,B0096PBD2O,"This film would be wonderful for all the family or for a mum to bring her daughter too especially if she likes rowing!  Whether you like romantic comedy or are into the sport of rowing this is a charming, amusing tale with James Van Der Beek no less!  And David Alan Basche makes a very funny cameo!  The strong female cast are great and in the wake of the Olympics its the perfect timing for such a film.",1355097600,,405,4.166666666666667
5274041,5,B0096PBD2O,One of the most entertaining films I have seen in a long time. Very beautiful story and is very sweet to watch. Acting was divine.,1355097600,5,130,4.24
5274042,2,B0096PBD2O,"As a former collegiate rower and a competitive rower ever since, I have to say that I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The acting was awkward and cliche, and the plot and characters very one-dimensional and predictable. Furthermore, the lead actress was not all that believable as an aspiring Olympic rower. Any rowing footage of the actors and actresses in the movie was sub-par and very hard for me to take seriously. The only rowing that actually looked authentic were scenes shot from a distance that clearly featured real rowers.

I definitely don't think experienced rowers will find this movie to be a very good representation of the sport or the time it takes to become proficient (particularly at the elite level). Viewers who have no knowledge of the sport may be more forgiving, but will most likely be disappointed by the lack of character and plot development. Those interested in an inspiring movie about rowing should instead watch ""Gold Fever,"" a documentary about the most decorated rower ever--Steve Redgrave--and his British teammates in their quest for five Olympic gold medals in their coxless four.",1355097600,6,1158,5.06282722513089

8536835,3,B0096PBD2O,"Could have been much better - so much potential for a powerful film, but they settled for mediocre. It's unrealistic - any serious athlete and especially someone training for the Olympics would never put down the liquor this girl does. And why have foul language? It's like the screenwriter picked a swear word of choice and made sure half the cast used it once ...why is it necessary? It just made a film with a lot of potential continually slip to just OK. Disappointed.",1508198400,,472,4.630952380952381

8536841,1,B0096PBD2O,"Hated it.  The big question was if she should give up her chance to row in the Olympics so that she could coach a high school (!) team's tournament.  Get that - HIGH SCHOOL.  Both her lousy boyfriend (the high school's athletic director) and the girls on the high school team give her a terrible time for choosing the Olympics.  They want her to give up her dream.  She's been training most of her life for this, for god's sake.

She (wisely) chooses the Olympics and then her teammates give her a hard time.  Well, it wasn't up to them.  It was up to the coach.

So she bails on that so she can go coach the high school team.

The boyfriend reluctantly lets her do it, after being prodded by the girls to give her a chance.  He had already cut her off personally and professionally.

So, she gets back together with the boyfriend, she coaches the team, and two of the girls go on to win the Olympics - in other words, she helped them to fulfill their dreams, and lost her own.  It's like the mother who says that maybe their kid can cure cancer someday rather than being a subject in her own right who tries to cure cancer herself.

This movie is a great example of encouraging women to give up on their dreams and settle for a guy who doesn't support you.  Many women have had too much of that female training and lost too many of their own dreams.  Don't coach a high school tournament and give up your chance to win the Olympics.  Lousy movie.",1457827200,,1447,4.241758241758242
