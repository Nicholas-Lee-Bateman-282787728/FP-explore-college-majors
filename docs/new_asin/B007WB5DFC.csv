8522446,3,B007WB5DFC,"I hear nothing special, and my impression from the EMI (?) series with this orchestra remains, which is that the orchestra is overparted and perhaps strained by this meandering approach.  Pretty, but not a patch on the old Vienna/Schuricht or the Cleveland/Welser-Moest DVD.",1462838400,,274,5.372093023255814
8522447,5,B007WB5DFC,"Certainly Celi was THE most under-rated conductor because of his iconoclasm. And this iconoclasm revolves around his use of slower tempi than other conductors, ALL other conductors. I never heard Bruckner AT ALL before listening to this composer as interpreted by Maestro Celibidache. So I come at the Bruckner symphonies from an opposite direction from most audiophiles.

First of all the production values which anyone can appreciate are all there. Excellent video direction and execution. The cameras (there are at least 3) keep moving in and out of the orchestra, back to the back of the Gasteig and then keeping tabs on the Maestro...all done unobtrusively. A well-done video.

But what is that theme in the Adagio? It must be very famous. It is exquisitely beautiful! It is heavenly. It brought tears to my eyes and a wrenching pain in my heart! It comes at about 27'30"" and again at 35'40"" in its full intensity. And watch Celibidache movements. He is the Master here. It all comes together here in 1985, all those years of hard work, often in small venues, as he went his own way. But here he is the Master of this evening, this orchestra, this concert hall, this symphony.

Bruckner, wherever you are - thank you.",1380412800,4,1222,4.809523809523809

8522449,5,B007WB5DFC,"Berliner philarmoniker is a well disciplined orchestra but in the years when Celibidache was the conductor of Munich philarmonic .. no orchestra in the whole world performed Bruckner but Munich philarmoniker. And not just Bruckner. All the other great composers , Tchaikovsky , Brahms , JSBach...etc... Celibidache was the greatest conductor of the 20th century . No comparison . Please don't have Kleiber, Karajan .. and all the 'others' on the same cd's with Celibidache. They do not belong in his world of music.",1352419200,3,515,5.142857142857143
8522450,5,B007WB5DFC,"To the end of my days, I will never understand how anyone, let alone a `rough and ready' school-teacher from Ansfelden, could compose a work such as Bruckner's Fifth Symphony. Far more than any endeavour by NASA, it the closest that mankind will ever come to reaching the stars. It is more of a celestial wonder than the Horsehead Nebula or a magellanic cloud.

Sergiu Celibidache expounded the view that Bruckner was the greatest of symphonists - and he won't get any counter-argument from yours truly. Here in this concert with the Munich Philharmonic from 1985, he measures himself against this stupendous creation and the results are riveting. Firstly, the visuals are terrific; many of these productions from the Eighties look grainy but not this one - it almost could have been filmed with a digital camera. Celibidache conducts from memory. His mastery is absolute, even with minimal gestures. Indeed, he actually stops conducting in the first movement to listen to the Munich Philharmonic as it struts its stuff. Come the coda of the finale, he adds a vocal line of his own and who can blame him - ` la la la la' - as all things converge. Nor is this the conductor as Stacee Jaxx; unlike his nemesis in Berlin, Celibidache does not hog the spotlight to the detriment of the orchestra.

As to the performance itself, it is stately, reverential and long-breathed. At twenty four minutes plus, the Adagio is rightly played as a threnody rather than a sprint through the local park with dish-lickers in train. The Munich Philharmonic plays for all it is worth and more. Perhaps in the last analysis it lacks the torque and incandescence of the Berlin Philharmonic but there is still much to luxuriate in. Better still, it looks as if Celi - a notorious martinet - forced the orchestra collectively to visit the barber before the concert itself: thankfully, mullets (otherwise known as `ape-drapes', `neck-warmers' 'follicular mudflaps' and `New Zealand Passport Photos') are refreshingly absent (and with nothing to lose, the Munich Philharmonic normally transgresses in this realm - Anna Wintour would rather drink gasoline than be seen with them).

Gun stuff. Go for it!",1351036800,5,2176,4.956164383561644
8522451,4,B007WB5DFC,"Sergiu Celibidache was a celebrated--but not uncontroversial--conductor of Bruckner.  This recently released DVD of his performance of Bruckner's 5th with the Munich Philharmonic was originally recorded in l985, 11 years before Celibidache's death.  It is a fine performance with quite good sonics for the period, with good visuals of the players and the Celibidache's countenance and understated conducting style.  However, when compared to the DVD of the same work by Claudio Abaddo at the 2011 Lucerne Festival, the Celibidache version seems at times to drag.  The tempos are slow throughout, diminishing the pulse and forward motion of the work.  Not a bad performance by any means, but not among the best.  I do prefer it, however, to the Cleveland Orchestra version under Welser-Most which, in my opinion, seems to miss the tension and drama of this masterpiece.",1349740800,7,868,5.299270072992701
8522452,5,B007WB5DFC,"Before seeing this performance of Anton Bruckner's monumental 5th symphony, I had heard his performances of the 5th on CD, but I was unprepared for the incredible power, the soaring spirituality, and the supreme playing of the Munich Philharmonic in this presentation from 1985. Prior to acquiring this performance, Gunter Wand's performance on DVD had been my video benchmark--I still like it very much. But this edition by Sergiu Celibidache literally seized me by the throat and kept me on the edge of my seat during almost the entire performance.

On CD I have a number of fine Bruckner 5 ths--there are at least half a dozen fine ones with Eugen Jochum, his very last from 1986 (released on Tahra), a kind of moving valedictory to life, as he was dying of cancer when he performed it with the Concertgebouw. His superb realizations always seem to me to incorporate and realize the essential Catholicity and spirituality of Bruckner, but also the earthy Austrian-ness that I think the polished von Karajan often misses. Next, there is Carl Schuricht, whose several recorded performances with the Vienna Philharmonic are equally remarkable for their clarity and power and deeply-felt understanding of Bruckner. Then there is Furtwangler (I think here in particular of his incredible 1942 wartime performance, now nicely mastered and available on Testament).

But this video rendition certainly goes to top ranking. It is longer than some of the other performances (on CD) I mentioned, but Celi' doesn't lose track; everything coheres, works together and ""fits."" More, Celi' allows you to ""see"" the structure of this symphonic masterpiece--Bruckner's intricate construction is there, audible, and perfectly and lovingly revealed. The sound literally breathes--Celi' lets it breathe.

Celibidache really caused me to sit up in the Adagio movement: I've never heard the strings sound this way in the 5th. Jochum comes mighty close; von Karajan polishes them beautifully. But Celi' has them soaring organically, almost infinitely, as it were, and taking the listener/viewer with him. The Finale captures, again, all the intricacies of Bruckner's cathedral-like edifice, while investing the music with incredible spiritual movement and power. I literally had tears in my eyes as the performance ended. I will return to it again and again.",1341446400,21,2336,5.308108108108108
