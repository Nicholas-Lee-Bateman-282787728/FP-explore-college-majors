1885461,5,B00009MVIH,"I bought this for my husband and daughter to enjoy together.  My daughter is still a little young for a video to hold her attention through the whole thing, but after watching the dvd, my husband (who has been on motorcycles since he was a kid) and I agree that it is very well done.  It shows the fun of riding while at the same time teaching kids to respect the safety aspect of the sport.  It emphasizes and re-emphasizes safety gear, which as a Mom, I really appreciate.
I see Dad and Daughter enjoying this one together for years to come!",1182902400,,543,4.303921568627451
1885462,5,B00009MVIH,"This is the perfect video for small children who are interested in dirt bikes and motorcycles.  It tells a story but shows some great footage of kids and adults riding.  The music isn't ""thrasher"" music like you get in the adult videos (very kid friendly and catchy).  I love that this video emphasizes safety when riding.  My boys, ages 2.5 and 1.5, ask for this video by name and watch it the entire way through.  It's now a staple birthday present for my friends with 2 year old boys!",1179100800,3,487,4.426966292134831

7991893,4,B00009MVIH,"My son really likes motorcycles and I was looking for a kid friendly DVD about motorcycles and all I could find was this DVD.  My son LOVES it.  Win for mom ... minus negative point for mom though due to the music.  Every time I have to play this for my son I want to bang my head in the wall as it is so annoying.  I've gone so far as to hide the DVD only for my son a few later finds it and screams ""Michael Michael Motorcycle!  Can I please watch this?"" and the cycle begins again.",1375833600,,484,3.8484848484848486

7991895,5,B00009MVIH,"I bought this DVD when my 7 yr. old grandson was three. It was his absolute favorite! Now his little brother is turning three and it is the 'only' movie he wants to watch, over and over and over! This video was designed for young viewers, and may not be suited for those over age 7 or so. It is also very instructional, focusing on safety and the differences between motorcycles, quad racers and dirt bikes. Lots of action  and well worth the investment!",1281398400,,454,4.404761904761905
7991896,5,B00009MVIH,"My 4 year old grandson LOVES this movie. He watched it 6 times the day we received it and has watched it at least 30 times since then. Very simple movie but it provides entertainment that does not include sex and rough language. Can't beat that. My grandson loves being outdoors playing as much as he can, but when the weather is bad or it is just time to settle in for the evening videos like this that are short, simple but provide ample entertainment are great.",1266105600,,464,4.344827586206897
