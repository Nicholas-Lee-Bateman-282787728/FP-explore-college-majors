782785,5,6304111835,"While I've not seen the original, I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the story.  Ted Danson does a fantastic job in this movie--beyond acting.  The special effects are not overdone--they never take you out of the movie, instead they draw you closer.  I recommend this movie strongly.",993686400,4,285,5.0212765957446805
782786,5,6304111835,"Contrary to popular belief, Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"" was never intended to be simply a children's fantasy / fairy tale.  Although the Lilliputans are cute as heck, this story has some serious overtones.  As a matter of fact, although more subtle perhaps, there are aspects of this tale which are  as dark and bitter as the commentaries on humankind written by the likes of  Dostoevsky, Camus and Kafka.  Jonathan Swift never was a very happy man.
This rendition of Swift's classic is, in a word, fabulous.  It reaches to the heart of the message Swift was trying to convey while at the same time is accessible to all.  It is also appropriate for a family to watch.  I cannot remark enough on just how well done this film was;  it would have been so easy to do a half-baked job and let it be yet another ambitious television movie that somehow went awry.  I'm so glad that didn't happen here.
In truth, I have never cared too much for Ted Danson.  However, in this film he delivers a surprisingly exceptional performance.  So much so, in fact, that looking back I can't imagine anyone else as Gulliver.  The rest of the cast did a superb job as well, and the inclusion of Peter O'Toole as the king of the Lilliputans was a great touch.  (Then again, when can having Peter O'Toole in the cast of a movie ever HURT?)  The direction and the way they chose to tell the story was wonderfully done.  The soundtrack (written by Trevor Jones, who co-wrote the soundtrack to ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" among other things) was right on the $$$ for emotionally gripping scenes.
This is the type of ambitious, fervent film-making that studios can be proud of.  If one Jonathan Swift were around today, I have no doubt that he could not and would not have asked for a better adaptation of his prose.  A GREAT movie!",977961600,68,1814,4.546296296296297
782787,5,6304111835,"I didn't see this movie when it first ran on television, but recently  bought the DVD and saw it for the first time.  For a made for tv  production, it was very well done, with an excellent and stellar cast.  Ted  Danson does a wonderful job as the title character, inflecting his  character with the proper touch of wonder, disbelief, incredulity, and  disgust at the different lands and things he sees during his travels.
I  have to admit I wasn't sure what I would think when I first started to  watch.  I had read the book many years ago, when I was in school, and  didn't recall a lot of it.  However, as the story progressed, I was happy  to see that the more I saw, the more I remembered of what I had read, and  that the movie seemed to follow the important parts of the book.  The thing  I had most remembered were the talking horses, and wondered how well they  would do that, but it was done well, so I have no complaints on that  score.
As I said, the actors all did a remarkably good job, and the  special effects were decent, making Gulliver appear to be both huge in the  land of the little people, and then small himself in the land of the  giants.
First rate family entertainment, and well worth seeing.  Do  yourself a favor and get it for your collection.",964396800,6,1274,4.260504201680672
782788,5,6304111835,"I didn't have any interest in Danson's previous movies, and when I saw Henson Productions, I thought we were going to see some kind of cutesy kid's thing.  How wrong I was!
This is a sumptuously directed series  that frees your mind to become totally involved with the story and the  underlying analysis and satire of fallen human thinking.  This production  manages to convey Swift's message to a modern audience with the same kind  of impact as the original stinging satire had on Swift's  contemporaries.
Danson gives a triumphally convincing performance as  Gulliver.  I can't imagine anyone doing it better.  I hope he plays more  roles like this.
The special effects are superb, but are there to support  the story rather than for their own sake. I especially enjoyed the episode  where Gulliver is  a 'guest' in a castle with an sinister host, with a  penchant for summoning famous historical figures into the present.  Restrained, menacing and downright eerie.
I am really pleased to see  Americans take an English classic and turn it into a movie with so much  panache and integrity.  Watch it!",929318400,10,1103,4.896739130434782
782929,5,6304111835,"What a wonderful tour de force. Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen are outstanding. Danson plays the sincere and confused Gulliver so well in the many disorienting settings he finds himself in. Steenburgen plays his loyal, brave, and loving wife with great feeling. The young son is played very well by Tom Sturridge, whose father directed this great movie. The special effects are still delightful and well done more than twenty years later. Peter O'Toole, Omar Shariff, and John Gielgud all do their parts well as very experienced actors.

 I recently watched this movie a second time, this time with my 16 year old son who also enjoyed it. I looked online for analyses from novelguide  and britannica and found them both helpful. For example, the Lilliputians represent the English political class, and the inhabitants of the flying island of Laputa  stand for scientists so consumed with abstract thinking that they are devoid of common sense.

The sets are beautiful and amazingly constructed. The movie is a feast for the eyes.

Gulliver's Travels, written in the 1700s by Jonathan Swift, still resonates today.",1496707200,,1114,5.093406593406593

782995,5,6304111835,"Among other things, the story engages one's imagination in a way that seems to validate that whole process of imagining.  As children, we may not have even thought about validation, but as adults, so much of our human purity has been worn down or contaminated by societal constraints that we develop a shield against truths about ourselves that are unpleasant or make us feel uncomfortable.  Thankfully, the author, Jonathan Swift, was inspired to document a fascinating and instructive adventure that, for me, wreaks of truth, the rarest of all treasures on earth.  The production of this film is a masterpiece, in my view, beautifully directed and marvelously performed, especially by Ted Danson, as Gulliver.  Watching this film alone or with my grandchildren is a special treat.",1462924800,,782,5.182539682539683
782996,2,6304111835,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this ""Widescreen Special Edition"".  I incorrectly assumed that the movie was originally filmed in genuine widescreen and that the version I happened to see on TV years ago was cropped down to full screen 4:3.  I thought I'd get the genuine widescreen version by purchasing this disk.

In actuality, the movie was originally filmed in full screen 4:3 and to make this ""Special Widescreen Edition"", the remastering company cropped out--deleted--a portion of the frame to give the appearance of widescreen.  Even this new ""widescreen"" version isn't a genuine widescreen but rather an odd letterboxed frame.  On modern TVs, it'll likely project on the screen surrounded by black bars on all 4 sides rather than using up the available screen real estate (perhaps as aspect ratio flag isn't set properly on the DVD?).  On my LG TV, I had to use the TV's ""zoom"" function to fill up the available screen area with the image.  The actual frame size, once I took out the letterboxing, is 720x388 or 16:10...a weird aspect ratio somewhere between 4:3 full screen and modern 16:9 HDTV widescreen.

In the attached frame captures, the picture on the left shows the original 4:3 frame content.  The frame on the right shows the new ""widescreen"" frame content.  You can see that a significant portion of the bottom of the frame is cropped out.

In my opinion, rather than enhancing the film, removing frame content actually detracts from the film...literally.  I recommend purchasing the original 4:3 version.",1459296000,10,1544,4.98828125

783096,5,6304111835,"As a scholar of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, I would be naturally predisposed to criticize a television adaptation of this important classic of Western literature. Yet I am deeply impressed with the quality of this outstanding, intelligent production. The screenwriter strings all of the Travels together as one long journey that is re-lived in memory by a half-mad Gulliver upon his return to England; this brilliant concept integrates the disparate stories for the screen and makes possible much greater depth of character. Ted Danson's masterful portrayal of Lemuel Gulliver is profound and subtle, passionate and immensely honest, evoking every bit of Swift's pain and his fury at flawed mankind. I could praise many aspects of the production; Trevor Jones' haunting and memorable music stands out, as does the work of solid supporting players such as Mary Steenburgen and Omar Sharif. The special effects are marvelous: delightful and yet not overdone. This is a rare gem, an adaptation that is appropriately respectful and yet vibrantly original. Its flaws are trivial in comparison with its strengths. I consider this television movie a substantial contribution to the ongoing history and discussion of Swift's greatest work.",1449705600,6,1240,5.463541666666667

It was a made for TV movie, and you can definitely tell by looking at it.  I didn't give it five stars because of the method used to make it wide screen.  The movie was shot in the SD TV kinda square-ish aspect ratio, so to make this full screen they chopped off the top and bottom of the image to emulate wide screen, that means that each shot is now tighter than it was originally intended.

There are some fun special features on the disc that show you behind the scenes footage and interviews.

Might as well be VHS.  Sure, it's still showing the film in its original format, but it's only using up a small fraction of any modern HD TV, so that's why I'm giving this one star.  A true shame.

Movies tend to fixate on the Lilliputians and, quite often, urinating to put the castle fire out.  Frankly, an aversion to Ted Danson let me to avoid this performance and I certainly deserve a kick in the rear for being such a yahoo.  It is well crafted, covers the major areas of Swift's satire and provides vivid an memorable images of his greatest satires.  The ""framing"" (in Bethleham, ie Bedlam) seems appropriate, especially since Gulliver mentions that he was assumed insane.  It is also an excellent satire in itself of the good care inmates in such institutions received.  I am so very glad I added Gulliver's Travels to my video library.",1331942400,3,805,4.748201438848921

Ted is amazing in this role and provides a truly exceptional performance that brings the tale to full life.  I wasn't familiar with the original tale beyond knowing Gulliver was captured by some little folk called the Lilliputians (or something like that).  I was impressed to learn the full scope of the story, all of which was masterfully told by the producers of this work.

I give it four rather than five stars as the production quality has a couple of small cheats by modern standards (although it is all still quite good) and the very ending played weakly for me.  An island of Mr. Eds seemed the wrong medium for the morality tale against greed and violence.

Wonderful cast. I have seen films that weren;t as half richly produced as this one. But the story kept going 'in & out' of realty & fantasy too much. I had to go back to scenes to 'try to understand the damn thing. Ted Danson was a perfect Choice to play Gullever, but it should have been played straight as the original ""Gullivers Travels"" was written by Jonathen Swift wrote it.

783426,4,6304111835,"This is about the best film adaptation of the original novel that was written by Jonathan Swift, an Irish writer and clergyman in the early 1700s. The novel was meant to be a clever  parody mixture of  travelers' tales, the court of George I, King of England, and the petty differences of religion that lead to wars.

The story centers on Lemuel Gulliver, a medical doctor and a ship's captain. As the plot progresses he is left alone on various mystical locations. Each place has its own unique characteristics this makes the adventure quite intriguing as the story progresses.

The Movie is broken down into two 'Books':

Book 1

 [1] Adventure at rival countries of Lilliput and Blefuscu. Here Gulliver is about 12 times the size of everyone else at that location.
 [2] Adventure at Brobdingnag : Here Gulliver is one twelfth the size of everyone there.

Book 2

[1] The Flying Island - Laputa  - satire on the Royal Society
[2] Empress Muodi's Estate
[3] Glubbdubdrib - the magician's dwelling - ancients versus moderns theme
[4] Struldburgs - immortals with blindness
[5] Houyhnhnms / Yahoos - deals with the inherent corrupt nature of mankind

The film features some very exotic locations including three palaces in Portugal, as well as fanciful building structures in England and a marble banquet hall on an estate in rural East Anglia.

The acting is superb and the cast features well known actors. It is truly a mind bending experience as to try to unravel the real message that Mr Swift was trying to convey. This is definitely a collector's item.",1285891200,4,1557,4.80827067669173

783490,4,6304111835,"I recently watched this film, which features Ted Danson at the head of an all-star cast. As Swift's book is one of my all-time favorites, I was interested to see this depiction of it - but I also approached it cautiously, because it is a hard novel to film, and I was skeptical of Danson's ability to pull off the lead role. I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised; the movie is generally well-done, and Danson does a superb job, as does the rest of the cast. I was impressed that the movie managed to adequately convey all of the requisite special effects without being overdone and/or cheesy. I was also glad to see that it managed to show a real sense of the totality of Swift's novel, from its charming and playful aspects to its fiery, misanthropic satire; unlike previous productions, it features all four parts of the book, despite a few inevitable cuts. It did veer from the book significantly in a few instances, particularly in its use of a new subplot that functions as a framing device; despite the extra-literary aspect of this content, though, I found it to be an acceptable and effective means of representing the story on film. Those involved also did a solid job of conveying a good overall sense of Swift's savage satire, although the altered ending does lose some of its biting, misanthropic edge as it is presented in the film. I believe that it would have been a better film if it had retained the original ending, but it remains a solid and thoroughly enjoyable adaptation.",1261008000,4,1504,4.594795539033457

783492,5,6304111835,"Despite its many faults, Hallmark's 1995 version of Gulliver's Travels is still the finest adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical classic - largely because it not only includes ALL of Gulliver's many travels but also includes the satire that's often overlooked. Unfortunately the twin problems of the book's highly episodic structure and a television budget (even a fairly lavish one) remain. The book is a somewhat rambling collection of traveller's tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees Gulliver returned to England clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed. The England scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world. The trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting. The Lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces - this has to be the only version where we don't see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him.

Yet once Gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the Utopians of Brobdingnag, a guest of the wise men of the floating island of Laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left, the guest/prisoner of a historian who learns history directly from the source, offered immortality with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the Houynhnhms that he's not an uncivilized Yahoo, each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is. For the most part it's a darker set of Travels than expected, with only Gulliver's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness - and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane. It's in these latter scenes that Ted Danson's Gulliver really shines, never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race.

Being made for television, the Yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page, but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down. The star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well-used (if somewhat briefly in a few cases) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them. It's hard to imagine the upcoming Jack Black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this.",1247443200,6,3153,4.947169811320754

783495,5,6304111835,"Johnathan Swift's beloved satire has amused readers for over 250 years, and shows no signs of waning. So many people have loved (or at least read) it, that it presents difficult target for movie-makers. No matter how they render it, they're sure to violate someone's image of the story. Despite a very few flaws, this version works remarkably well.

For one thing, it presents a reasonably complete telling of Lemuel Gulliver's story. I haven't read the original lately, but this seems to cover the entire tale, not just famous favorites like the visit to Lilliput. It also covers some of the moments that other versions skip, like putting out the Lilliputian palace fire. A parody of academic research holds up well, too, and might be even more relevant today than when Swift poked fun at the Royal Society's experimenters. Competent special effects make it easy to suspend disbelief for the film's duration.

Perhaps it's unfair, but the high points of this recreation work so well that the few low points seem even lower by contrast. The visit to Brobdingnag retains its political bite, buthis made-for-TV movie had to cut a few ""adult"" moments from Swift's version. The Struldbrugs really suffered at this director's hands, though. Perhaps there was some political correctness issue in toning their senility down, but that passage lost nearly all the impact of the original.

The good outweighs the bad, however, and the good includes some remarkable star power, including Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud in brief but significant roles. The storytelling format works too, as flashbacks of story bubble up through Gulliver's damaged mind. This two-disc set is sure to brighten many rainy afternoons, as long as your younger viewers aren't skittish sorts.

783496,5,6304111835,"I recall being enormously impressed with this 2-part made-for-TV movie when it was first broadcast in 1996, and the intervening twelve years have not diminished it any.  The production is fairly true to Swift's original, and contains many innovative and surprisingly-effective special effects (for the time).  All of the cast members give boffo performances, particularly hammy Peter O'Toole in the role of a lifetime.  But most impressive of all is the gentle and very sly interweaving of fantasy and insanity, where Lemuel Gulliver's state of mind continuously shifts between frames of reference both in size and veracity.

Swift's vulgar sense of humor is given free expression, and the biting satire of his political wit still rings familiar 270 years later.  The film contains the free-wheeling giddiness of Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"" (1981) and the time- and frame-of-reference-shifting vertigo of ""Smoke Signals"" (1998). Tiny details and thrown-away background elements make it a production for rewarding repeated viewing.

In short this is a film of Brobdingnagian proportions which has received Lilliputian acclaim.  This is a gap of Yahooian injustice.",1224374400,27,1166,5.553672316384181

The story was well done. The guy comes back after a long-time and tells people what he has seen. Of course no-one believes such stories of small people, giants, flying castles and intelligent horses. He has to prove that he is sane.

783574,5,6304111835,"Gulliver the book and Gulliver the movie are different but, after a while, the difference stops being important. In the book, Gulliver is superior to all of his adventures. He possesses a perspective on the whims and eccentricities of kings in a writing meant as a criticism of all who hold themselves superior. The movie Gulliver enjoys his status at court. His sincere explanations/justifications of England's political practices seem even more ridiculous in the telling than in the reading. What movie Gulliver finally focuses on are the relationships between himself and his wife and son. They remained faithfull to him despite his having abandoned them.  The wife's defense for her husband is that Gulliver has harmed no one. The son's providing the critical piece of evidence deflects the prosecution.

783576,5,6304111835,"The film is told by way of flash backs.  Gulliver (Ted Danson) finds himself ashore in England after a harrowing nine year absence from home.  Unfortunately, once back at home in England, he suffers from periodic flashbacks wherein he provides narratives about his adventures in Lilliput, Brobdingnag, on a flying island, and elsewhere.  Also unfortunately, even his wife (Mary Steenbergen; wife in real life too) does not believe the contents of his flash-back narratives.  For example, towards the end of the movie she is asked if she believes her husband.  Instead of saying ""no,"" she avoids the question by replying, ""I believe in him.""

Everybody will be able to enjoy the brightly colored pomp and fanfares found in the various kingdoms that are encountered during Gulliver's travels.  The special effects are almost as good as those found in the early Star Wars movies.  Unlike most adventure movies, the movie under review has a high degree of character development.  The credentials of the actors, e.g., Peter O'Toole, speak for themselves. Excellent ""character actors"" are also found, such as the rustic wheat farmer who discovers Gulliver and displays him in a one-man circus.  In addition to the special effects, the presence of a boy character (Gulliver's son) and a girl character (wheat farmer's daughter) enhance the attraction of the film for kids.

What the movie is really ""about"" is not tiny villagers, flying islands, or talking horses.  What the movie is really about is certain bizarre aspects of the social order, found at the time of Swift's writing.  For example, one goal of the Gulliver story was to protest the practice of selling (as opposed to voting) government positions.  Therefore, it might be to the advantage of any viewer, or parent, to become familiar with the social/political customs prevalent at the time.  A suitable book (which actually covers France, not England), is The French Revolution and Human Rights by Lynn Hunt (1996).  As with the Gulliver movie, this book explains the existance of formalized upper and lower classes, and the practice of selling government positions.",1166918400,12,2123,5.145772594752186
783577,5,6304111835,"One of the better commentaries on the various follies of different societies was the book ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift.  The movie plays out as a travelogue of a man, Gulliver, who travels the world and encounters a series of incredible and sometimes unbelievable races and individuals.  These characters are meant to represent the best and worst of humanity, and everything in between.  Through his travels, Gulliver comes to realize the abilities and limits of man, both emotionally and physically.  The movie is played out in recall, as it begins with Gulliver returning home to his wife and child.  Emotionally distraught, he recollects his past 8 years traveling the world.  In doing so, he bewilders his wife, amuses his son, and frustrates the town doctor who does not believe a word he said.  The movie is done quite well; the casting is good; the special effects are amazing and very believable, and the casting is perfect.  This movie is great for the whole family and I highly recommend it.",1152921600,2,1011,4.940828402366864
783578,5,6304111835,"Since Gulliver is representing mankind, most of those who read the book naturally consider that he is the hero and therefore superior to all other creatures. In order to hold on to that belief many people find fault with the horse's decision to expel the weak, treacherous, gullible human and even blame the horses for their very perfection.

The movie tries to make it extra clear that we are NOT what we portrait ourselves to be by displaying Gulliver's reluctance to except his human condition. Remember, this was written by a catholic priest, embroiled in political deceit by the rulers of the colony where he grew up. The judges show how misguided it is to believe we humans are reasonable, much less that we were created to be superior.

Viewers who want to hang on to their nave narcissism will be vexed by this story, which is exactly what Swift was trying to accomplish, as he said himself in his letter to his friend, another writer of religious and political criticism (google: swift gulliver vex pope).",1147737600,2,1014,4.755681818181818
783579,2,6304111835,"The screenwriters at Hallmark are amazing.  Every time they see a story that has lasted for one or more centuries on its own, their immediate reaction is that the story needs major improvement.

How do they do it?  Certain methods are a given: start with an unappealing star.  Make sure he has an accent as far from that required by the story as possible (in this case British).

Having trashed the main character, you may now turn your attention to finding ways to ruin the story.  In this case, make it easy for yourself and throw in a different story and put the main emphasis on that.  Then, squeeze the original story so that there is not enough time to do it justice.  Then, prevent anyone from getting caught up in the original story by cutting away from this story every minute or so--since, of course, nobody's interested in Gulliver's travels anyway--and get back to your own trashy, off-the-shelf story--which, of course, everybody is interested in.

Et voila!  You have another movie ready to be purchased, watched once and thrown into the trash can.

If you're curious as to how this story might have been handled, see the BBC movie ""Gulliver in Lilliput"" (1988).  (See imdb.com for info or search the used video dealers like half.com.) This movie only covers book I of Gulliver's Travels, but it will give you an idea what the book is like.

Who has a little insight into a psychological point of view, will moreover discover, that in the gigantic Gulliver, with whom the childlike spectator of course identifies himself at the first meeting, - that this Gulliver helps to become resistant against every nasty surroundings, which will happen to us in our lifetime, using a fantasy-based, satirical technique of making bad things small and unimportant! Swift gives a therapeutically example for children (always being the smaller ones, helpless, powerless at the lower rank of the social influence scale) how to make a wonderful reversal of the everyday fright. The Gulliver shape reconciles to the powerlessness feelings of the childhood. When Jonathan Swift wrote this story, the situation of childhood in Europe was substantially worse than today. Gulliver's journey to the country of the dwarves (Liliput) is the favorite story. But the other one, his journey to the giants in the land ""Brobdingnag"" is more unloved. Many small ""Liliput""-towns are built for tourists - but you cannot find any ""Brobdingnag""-town, where you have the chance to feel small and surpressed. All in all: Swift has (like a more mocking Homer) created a bold parody on the old Greek ""Odyssey"". Of course this is a great challenge to movie-makers, but Charles Sturridge has managed this problem - using famous actors and a not too small budget ...",1127779200,,1551,5.134387351778656
783661,3,6304111835,"I remember this film quite clearly when I was in high school. At the time, I found it fantastic that I could watch a book without worrying about the doldrums of actually reading it.  Looking back on it now, I remember a feeling of fantasy and imagination. I could only wonder what was running through Swift's mind as he wrote this symbolic story. Watching it again, older ... wiser ... and more inept to read instead of watch, I thought it was still a wonderful story. There were flaws, as there is with any made-for-TV film, but they seemed smaller then some of the big budget films that I have witnessed lately. I think that the fact that Henson's son had his hands in this allowed the creativity to leap from the screen.

The biggest aspect of this film that I enjoyed was the satire on society. In every place that Gulliver travels he either imposes his society on others or they impose on him. There are times when they try to co-exist, but it ultimately fails in the end. Overall, the film is very well done indeed, with perfect art design, costuming and atmospheric direction by Sturridge- the Glubbdubdrib section is brilliantly eerie. Ted Danson is nothing short of fantastic, in a studied yet emotional performance. He has trouble with the English accent at times, but the effects and ensemble acting overshadow it. Steenbergen is less memorable, but still effective. The star-studded supporting cast impresses throughout, especially to O'Toole's Lilliputian Emperor and Nicholas Lyndhurst's Clustril. The music is near perfect as well.

Overall, a decent outing by everyone involved and worth viewing again for those that may be hesitant to read the books.

Not to mention all of the nit-picky things that deviate from the original story line. I do admit however that I did enjoy the movie but Swift is turning in his grave!,1097366400,7,470,4.292134831460674
783663,5,6304111835,"But this Hallmark TV production was so exceptional, I felt five was the least this sucker deserved.

This was the first of an extended series of high-toned TV movies produced by Robert Halmi Sr. for NBC and ABC that had production values previously unseen on television. In art direction and general feel, this production of the Jonathan Swift classic resembled ""Amadeus"" more than it resembled ""The Winds Of War"" or ""Mother, Can I Sleep With Danger?"".

And considering the choice for the titular lead, comic actor and former model Ted Danson, it could have been a real disaster. It wasn't! The man acquits himself nicely as the somewhat incredulous Lemuel Gulliver, the hero of a satirical tale told by the very cynical Jonathan Swift, Britain's answer to Voltaire. (Actually, Voltaire was a good deal younger than Swift and ""Gulliver's Travels"" was written 32-33 years before ""Candide"", allegedly, but they _were_ contemporaries, and had even met!)

The story features very fanciful alllusions to pettiness, classic paranoia of the delusions of grandeur variety, pomposity, a favorite target of Swift's, and superciliousness. There's the tiny Lilliputians, their opposites, the Brondignagians, the equine Houiynihms, (who, I seem to remember, were supposed to resemble giraffes as well,) and many other fantastic characters, all rendered beautifully in this, the first of a distinguished list of first rate classical adaptations shown on NBC in the late 90s.

The cast list is unbelievable...people who had NEVER been on TV before, like Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, James Fox, Isabelle Huppert, Geraldine Chaplin (hello!), Shashi Kapoor and John Gielgud were sprinkled all through it. The sets are incredible and acting superb. If either this or the later ""The Odyssey"" had been released as feature films, they would have garnered significant praise for production values and acting, as well as fidelity to their sources, (despite some serious key scene omissions,) and probably would have generated respectable box office.

Special effects, cinematography and scene direction made this a good bellwether for a raft of films unlike any TV had ever seen since the fifties, when top quality productions of plays by well known playwrights peppered prime time schedules.

The general take on the story treats the main character, Lemuel Gulliver, as someone just about everybody, including his wife, for a while, thinks is certifiably insane, as he keeps rambling on about the fantastic lands and people he has supposedly seen. Most of the ""real world"" story, in fact, takes place in either an asylum, where he has been committed, or a courtroom, where his case is being heard.

It's obvious to the viewer, too, that Lemuel has dreamt all of this, because these places couldn't possibly exist. However, a real curve ball is thrown in the end when a truly diminutive sheep is found and provided as evidence that at least proves Lilliput existed.

Mary Steenbergen went on after this, ( a lot of the actors were recycled in future productions of this type by Halmi,) to portray the wife of Noah in a gawd-awful NBC production of  ""Noah's Ark"", a production that mated the story of Lot and Sodom & Gomorah, (sans Abraham,) with the story of the flood. There was a ridiculous dream sequence inserted in this disaster that showed that Halmi's production crew was getting a WEE bit too satisfied with itself as Steenbergen, especially, spoke bubbleheaded lines that seemed WAY out of place for the setting of the story.

She should have stuck with 18th century satires! :-)",1075420800,22,3563,5.127586206896551
783664,5,6304111835,"I admit to being skeptical, but tried this DVD based upon other reviews. I've seen a number of film adaptations of Swift's intelligent & scathing 18th c. satire which routinely treat the story as a children's adventure novel.  Ted Danson is a wonder; his acting is superb; the script is excellent.  On the whole, don't be misled to think this a fluff production by star-studded cast; many are amazing.  The novel is treated with respect & the ideas area conveyed with integrity.  A must for adults & children.  My daughter who is 12 was pulled in & kept interested by the great acting & scenery - to learn & watch the story.  This  is the stuff that great novels & films are all about.",1068940800,4,685,4.475806451612903
783665,3,6304111835,"I bought this film on VHS, and it comes in two cassettes, roughly half of the film in each cassette.
I loved the first half of this film. Gulliver, his wife, and son - they are all excellent actors; particularly when Gulliver recounts his fabulous adventures to his believing young son - they are a charming duo. Peter O'Toole is also hilarious as the cruel and petty, but adorably tiny, King of Lilliput.
The story is delivered on screen with ingenious skill: remember, there are two stories to be told at once - Gulliver's travels, as he relives them with us, the viewer, and Gulliver after his travels, as he tells them to us, the viewer. These are two sides of the same coin, and the filmmakers weave them together with clever artistry.
In the second half of the film, the novelty of experiencing all of what I've just described wears off, and the travels become aimless wanderings, where Gulliver becomes stern and preachy about the failings of human nature. Things get very boring indeed, but the first half still remains for me both fresh and endearingly funny. If only the first half of this film was made, I imagine I'd be giving ""Gulliver's Travels, Unfinished"" the full five stars.",1060300800,5,1192,4.680952380952381
783666,5,6304111835,"I missed the TV premier of this movie, and finally checked it out at the library.  This is a wonderfull tale of a journey through lands that are satires of the extremes of different cultural ideals.  The interresting part is how Gulliver is changed as he travels through these different lands.
He finds himself washed up on a beach, and surrounded by little people.  He gets to know them, and finds them to be horribly warlike, corrupt, and so rediculous in thier methods of decision making it's laughable.  Since he is too large to feel threatened he finds his situation amusing, when we know that these same policies would be disastrous and scary in real life.
Next, he is in a land of Giants, and is at first paraded as a momey-making scam by some pesants before he makes it to the palace of the queen of the land to be a jester.  This land is a suposed utopia of freedom and equality in which people all bring thier crops to a central trading area, where the food and wealth is distributed with equality.  Gulliver holds a series of lectures about his own society and why they do things the way they do.  Of course, these enlightened people who know nothing of war find his stories to be a terrible thing.  However, this liberal utopia also has it's faults.  Not everyone is really happy with thier place in society, espically the person who Gulliver replaced in the castle.  The rich royalty are content to talk about equality and pat themselves on the back for thier tolerance and good treatment of the poor, while giving everyone else the jobs of feeding the pigs and working in the fields.
Next, he finds his way to a great floating island populated by intilictuals who contemplate the sun, moon, stars.  At first he is impressed by thier intelect and great powers, but soon enough discovers these geniouses are so full of themselves for thier genious that they cannot see the world for what it is or even communicate with others without being beaten with a baloon to keep them from 'drifting off' while in conversation.
He also finds his way to the home of a sorcerer who keeps him drugged and captive.  After finding a creative way to escape this place he is at sea once again and is washed up onto a land of savages and of horses.  The cavemen are the opitomy of every vise of people.  The horses on the other hand exist in balance and harmony with nature.  Gulliver finds a home with these creatures, until some incidences lead the horses to judge him as a 'yahoo' savage, and he is banished once again.  With this final tale, he is also in a trial to judge his sanity.  Throughoud the whole movie the memories of his journey are like halucinations, and Gulliver himself a madman.  He is finally able to use the final experience as a story to plead his sanity, and the rediclousness of some socital vices.
A good family movie, I enjoy it very much.",1036022400,4,2860,4.499032882011606
783667,4,6304111835,"The only flaw I see in this well told story is Steenburgen's awful British accent.  Why do people try to feign an English accent when their own voice will do very well (as Danson's did in this production).  Otherwise, no complaints.  Entertaining, lush, Well done!",1035158400,3,264,4.822222222222222
783668,4,6304111835,"I would have rated this 5 stars, but it was made unnecessarily long by the introduction of an ""insanity"" plot which detracted from the story and was never part of the book.  Good special effects, though.",1016841600,2,203,4.638888888888889
783669,5,6304111835,One of the great misfortunes of literature is that this book somehow got listed as a children's fable.
