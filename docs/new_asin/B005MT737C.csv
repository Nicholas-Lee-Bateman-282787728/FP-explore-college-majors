8479738,5,B005MT737C,"This concert unites singers May'n and Nakajima with composer Yoko Kano.  The first few tracks can be a bit concerning though, especially when the children's choir takes the stage and when Nakajima gets her hands on those Valkyries.  I prefer the Final Budokan Blu-ray which feels like a more polished production although this Cosmic Nyan release is great if you still want more Frontier music.  There is also an amazing live performance of Universal Bunny which I feel is much better than the studio version.  While the Blu-ray feature disc will play on US Blu-ray players, the bonus DVD is region 2 and will not play on most domestic players.",1471996800,,643,4.818181818181818
