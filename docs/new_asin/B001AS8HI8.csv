3466551,1,B001AS8HI8,"First off all i would like to return right away but i opened it :( to try of course. My baby is five month and 17lbs. It's impossible to do this routine w/ him on my hands. And not olny because it's too heavy. but because he's kicking (my body) and reaching everything around.
This DVD is only for newborns!!!!! Though it's written on the back that it's good 0-12 month, weel unless the baby is sleeping.
So mommys don't waist your money.",1219363200,5,438,4.289156626506024
3466552,5,B001AS8HI8,"I spent a lot of time researching Mommy/Baby yoga DVDs.  This one seemed to be the only one that really included baby.  I was nervous because there weren't too many reviews, but I didn't need to be.  It is a moderate yoga workout (as with any yoga session, you take it as far as you can go) but most importantly, baby is included in every single position.  She encourages you to talk to baby at points, to tickle her, and an overall interaction throughout.  I love this DVD.  It makes it possible for me to workout and not have to wait for baby to be napping!  Give it a try, it really is worth it if you want a post-natal yoga practice that fully integrates baby.",1215820800,29,664,4.222222222222222
3466553,5,B001AS8HI8,"I LOVE this DVD.  I have looked and looked for a practice that I could do with my baby.  I had the hardest time trying to find time to exercise or do yoga after the baby came, and I looked everywhere.  I tried videos, I tried books, and I didn't find much that worked for me.  The baby always needed me before I could get 10 minutes into it!

But THIS is different!  I love it!  Your baby is in every single pose.  Ann figured out creative ways to keep your baby in your arms or close to your face in almost all of the poses.  I love it.  My baby loves it!  Half the time she falls asleep while we do it!

Ann offers helpful comments for those who had c-sections, also.  I liked that a lot.

I also LOVE the two soundtrack options.  You can pick calm piano music or more upbeat new-agey music.  It helps keep things new.  I really like it.

I highly recommend this DVD to all new moms!!",1212710400,55,886,3.9942528735632186
3466554,2,B001AS8HI8,"If your Baby is not at all active then this video is for you.  My Baby is far to active to hold in these poses, and I think she's about average in that department.  Not for me, and my active Baby!",1306368000,3,196,3.7560975609756095
3466555,5,B001AS8HI8,"I love love love this video! It is great, and relaxing. I sometimes repeat some of the mantras to myself during stressful times during the day. My babies seem to enjoy it (I have twin boys). It is nice to be doing an activity after so many months of laying on the couch. Its low impact enough that I'm not straining myself but I do feel a little soreness in my legs and arms the next day so I know its working. I highly recomend this video. I also like the fact that she reminds you about not doing certain exercises if you've had a c-section.",1304380800,2,543,4.132075471698113
3466556,5,B001AS8HI8,This dvd is great for recovering after your baby is born. She tells you exactly how to take it easy for the best recovery. It really isn't meant for bigger more active babies but it's perfect for bonding with a brand new little one. <3,1302307200,2,235,4.2444444444444445
3466557,4,B001AS8HI8,"I searched and searched for a yoga dvd that would REALLY include my new baby in the workout routine. This really does do that wonderfully. It's a good workout for me and I love that it incorporates my baby so well. When it says every pose, it really means it. But, it's not perfect. The production quality leaves much to be desired, the music is a little corny, so if that will really bother you, just beware. But what I really wish was that the workout was broken into short segments, maybe 10 or 15 minutes. Because after too long my daughter gets a little frustrated, needs a diaper change, needs to nurse, etc., 45min - hour is just too long. I'm sure that will be less of a problem though as she gets older. Overall, I'm really liking this dvd. It's pretty much exactly what I was looking for.",1290384000,5,798,4.326666666666667
3466558,1,B001AS8HI8,I should have checked this DVD out at a local library before buying it.  Not what I expected.  The baby in the DVD sleeps all the time and it won't work when you have a curious 3 month old.,1274659200,7,189,3.8205128205128207
3466559,5,B001AS8HI8,"This video is great for those moms who want to get a kick start on getting in shape through yoga or who just simply want to find a way to relax and get some exercise with your baby around. If you've done yoga before, this video is great. Although, I think it's great for beginners, too. Since it's a video, you can go at your own pace. It probably won't work well with moms with babies that are crawling and active, but it works well with infants. It's also a good bonding exercise with you and your baby if you're having troubles with bonding with your new baby. Overall, I think it's a great video for mom and baby.",1274140800,2,617,4.19327731092437
3466560,4,B001AS8HI8,"I ordered this DVD as a way to get back in shape after having my baby.  I thought it would be great because I could do it with my baby, instead of waiting for him to nap, and wasting nap time working out (when I could be showering, or napping myself!)  Unfortunately, my baby hates it when I try to do this yoga.  I don't know why, but he gets really fussy and becomes unbearable after about 5 minutes.  But I do like the DVD, and they explain how to do it if you are sore from your delivery or c-sect.  I would like to use it more!",1262131200,2,532,3.888888888888889
3466561,4,B001AS8HI8,This video gave me ways of playing with my baby and working out at the same time. I use them throughout the day. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the long intro each time I turn it on. Considering what is out there to choose from I think this is one of the better ones.,1248739200,2,295,3.774193548387097
3466562,2,B001AS8HI8,"I was disappointed.  When shopping for Mom & Baby DVD's there doesn't seem to be much of a range.  Either it's for a little baby (like this one) or it's for Mom & Toddler.  My daughter is 9 months old and is mobile (rolling, almost crawling).  She wouldn't sit still for this at all.  So there's an age range for the baby that this would be appropriate for - but they don't tell you that.  This would have been great when she was little, immobile and slept a lot but we're well past that.  If your baby is older than an infant, save your money.",1248220800,5,544,4.123809523809523
3466563,4,B001AS8HI8,"I bought two postnatal yoga CD's, one for use with the baby and one without.  This is the CD that I keep returning to.  When my baby was 3 weeks old, he responded very little during the poses and slept through many.  Now, at eight weeks, he is very engaged, although he does not love every pose.  There are a variety of poses, and they vary in difficulty.  I enjoy how the baby is incorporated into many of the poses (even adding some extra weight and difficulty).  At eight weeks, it is getting difficult to incorporate my son into one pose, the modified boat pose - but he is a very large baby.

I have three criticisms.  First, Ann Richmond, the orator, does not provide a lot of reminders about good posture and good positioning in poses.  If you were not engaged in yoga before purchasing this CD, I would be concerned that you might not do the poses with good form.  Second, I am breastfeeding, and I almost always have to stop the DVD part way through to feed my son.  I wish that the time between chapters was shorter (one chapter per pose would have been ideal!).  My version also has some audio problems.  The volume of the background music varies a lot, at one point overwhelming Ann Richmond's voice.

Even with those criticisms, I would buy this DVD again.  It is fun, and I love how it really opens my eyes to the ways my baby is changing.",1238371200,10,1353,4.334661354581673
3466564,2,B001AS8HI8,"I did like the dvd but it was too slow and too relaxed for me and the baby. Perhaps I'm used to more upbeat yoga programs and my baby is too active, but I felt like I was about to go to sleep. If you like a more slow paced yoga practice then this is for you. If you like to keep things moving and not feel like it's dragging, I suggest a different video.",1236816000,,354,3.7333333333333334
3466565,4,B001AS8HI8,"I purchased this DVD to do some yoga at home with my 3 month old. We are already going to a mommy and me yoga class together and I thaught it would be good to do some stretches at home too. I like this DVD, some parts are really fun to do together. What I do not like is that some parts are a little bit boring (the standing postures) not only for me but also for my baby who starts crying every time we do this part. Otherwise I think it is a good exercise and I will continue doing it.",1236038400,4,487,3.784313725490196
3466566,3,B001AS8HI8,"Okay DVD. my daughter is 8 months old. This DVD was a little slow and boring but i guess it would be good for a newborn baby. Overall, okay dvd.",1235952000,,144,3.8333333333333335
3466567,2,B001AS8HI8,"I would only recommend this DVD for moms who did not do any yoga pre-pregnancy. The poses are not challenging in the slightest - holding your baby with one arm while waving the other up and down occurs too many times for my taste. Also, I made the mistake of thinking that having the baby integrated in each pose would be great entertainment for my baby. Wrong. Holding your baby while you do a yoga pose does not, to me, mean that the baby has been well integrated. If your baby is sleeping it's fine, but if he likes to be bounced, swayed, or moved in any way, he will get bored and will not be still enough for you to hold the poses.",1232928000,17,636,4.137096774193548
3466568,5,B001AS8HI8,"This video is great, I did it for the first time today with my 3 month old and we made it about 2/3 of the way through before she started fussing. I think she would have made it all the way if I did it when she wasn't so tired to begin with. It felt great to get back into yoga and she loved the face to face contact that many of the poses have. The only thing that was difficult for her was the constant change of position, but that comes with the yoga practice. Overall I think this is a great video, the scenery is beautiful, the woman's voice is soothing and it is a good workout that I think we will be doing a lot!",1228435200,4,620,3.8515625
3466569,5,B001AS8HI8,"My baby needs a lot of individual attention.  When I put him down, he fusses because he wants to interact and be held.  I've been kind of down in the dumps because it's been hard finding time to exercise when taking care of my precious boy.  I've found the perfect solution!!!  This video works perfectly for me because I get the exercise I need and it works perfectly for him because he gets the attention he needs.  I'm not going to lie and say it works perfectly every time.  There are days he is overly fussy and tired and not interested in exercising with mommy.  In fact, the first time I tried the video, I was only able to do about 5 minutes because my little guy was too fussy.  But the key is to KEEP TRYING. The very next time I did it, he LOVED it!  It was such a special bonding time for us both.

The instructor has such a soothing, wonderful voice. I have her other two videos (Yoga for Pregnancy and Yoga For Yourself) and I love them all!  I never get tired of listening to her and I look forward to strength and energy it gives my body.  Highly recommended.",1225756800,7,1075,4.190243902439025
3466570,5,B001AS8HI8,"This is a fantastic and straightforward yoga routine to get you back into shape and encourages lots of interaction with your baby.  It took me awhile before I could do the entire routine with my 5 month old since he lost patience at first, but I found the positions helpful even without him.  There was also good focus if you've had a c-section and felt any tugging on your incision and how to modify the poses so they were comfortable.  I would recommend this video to any yoga loving mom that wants to share that love with her child.",1221177600,5,535,4.383838383838384
3466571,5,B001AS8HI8,"I enjoyed the series because it made me feel relaxed and helped getting my strength back after labour.
Also the boundary between my baby and I increased. The sound track is very soothing and Ann's voice is calm and reassuring. Excellent way to new mommies get back in shape.",1220054400,3,274,4.612244897959184
3466572,5,B001AS8HI8,"Our 4th beautiful daughter was born 6 months ago, and my wife wanted to get 'back into shape' after the pregnancy.  She was thinking about Yoga, and so I got her this DVD, just thinking that it'd be great if she could work out with our relatively newborn baby girl.

I must say, that both she and I have been amazed at how doing this 'Yoga for Mom and Baby' has really helped her get her pre-pregnancy body back!  She's been more full of energy, and hasn't had to put our daughter down to cry, just so she can work out!

As a caring husband I really have been so happy to watch my wife see herself in the mirror and have the confidence in herself and her body that she had years ago -- if not more confidence!  This Yoga practice has really been one of the best purchases we've ever made because of the personal strength, inner peace, and great body that she's gained from it!

I highly recommend this for any mother (or husband wanting to get a nice gift for his wife), and I'm not quite sure about the negative review -- our baby is 6 months old, 21 lbs and kicks, and my wife does just fine adapting to our baby's wiggles.",1219708800,26,1125,4.161290322580645
3466573,5,B001AS8HI8,"This DVD is WONDERFUL! Of course nothing is going to go perfectly smooth the first time you try it (especially when there's a baby involved), but I loved how good I felt being able to be that close to Baby Claire and know I was doing something good for both of us. The music is soothing and the instructor's voice is encouraging. The setting is relaxing and beautiful, and I look forward to being able to get a little better and a little closer to Baby every time I do this!! I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone looking to grow closer to their baby and feel better and stronger while doing it!!",1219536000,3,600,4.31858407079646

8279361,5,B001AS8HI8,"I LOVE this yoga practice! It is a great flow & I love the ideas for incorporating my baby into each pose! It took a while for my baby to be ready to do longer amounts of this video with me, but it's easy to just do a few minutes and pause if needed. 10-15 minutes of stretching is better than nothing!",1420502400,,302,3.8870967741935485
8279362,1,B001AS8HI8,"Not what Id hoped it was going to be.  Should've listened to the other reviews. Very poor sound, quality and content. No way to pause or skip, extremely slow and boring.",1419120000,,169,4.451612903225806
8279363,5,B001AS8HI8,A thoughtful practice for mom and baby.  A great way to share and connect with baby.  I am happy with this purchase.,1397606400,,116,4.2272727272727275
8279364,4,B001AS8HI8,This video is a great way to destress and relax for both mom and baby. We both love the time spent together while doing this video.,1360195200,,131,4.076923076923077
8279365,2,B001AS8HI8,I was really excited to try this video but when I tried it with my baby she was 4 months old and it didn't engage her enough so I was only able to do a couple minutes before she would fuss. I feel like it is better suited for a 1-2 month old. Wish I had tried it then!,1351814400,,268,3.559322033898305
8279366,2,B001AS8HI8,Seriously bad audio-visual and did not keep me or baby engaged at all. We quit after 5 minutes. I was very disappointed.,1340064000,,120,4.5
8279367,3,B001AS8HI8,"I have tried this yoga practise for a few weeks now. It is helpful, but not when you have an active baby. Sometimes I can't help wondering how come the baby in the DVD has never complained. The music is calming, which I like. Also, I agree with some reviews, the picture is aweful. If you are consistent, you still find this yoga is beneficial, when you practise on your own.",1326499200,,375,4.295774647887324
8279368,4,B001AS8HI8,"The first thirty minutes of this workout are pure bliss. (Well, minutes 3-33. The first three minutes are a difficult-to-skip intro you only need to watch once.) My back feels great. I feel relaxed and calm. And my baby can't stop smiling at me.

That being said, I have yet to make it past the 37-minute mark of this 48-minute workout, despite several tries. My pediatrician commented on the length of my baby's attention span, but three quarters of an hour is a bit much to ask of an eight-week-old. I wish the DVD spent less time in mountain pose--which my son unequivocally hates, by the way--and more time on the interesting and useful poses from the rest of the workout. The workout could almost certainly be compressed into a more baby-friendly thirty minutes, but because the DVD is continuous--no tracks--there isn't a way for me to skip through the poses he doesn't like to get more bang for my buck time-wise.

Maybe as my son's attention span grows, I'll get to see what the last eleven minutes of the DVD contain! If they're as solid as the first thirty minutes, I'm sure my son and I will both benefit.",1315267200,,1116,4.575
