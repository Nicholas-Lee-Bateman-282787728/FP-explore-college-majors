3913700,5,B002DXU54S,"These videos are well done. Volume 4 was worth the price of the 4 volume set on its own and the basis for my rating. The least valuable to me was Volume 3, ""Your New Dog, First Day and Beyond"", which is mostly about choosing a dog that is right for your energy level, and I was looking for tips on such things as housetraining.",1260316800,7,327,4.046153846153846
3913701,5,B002DXU54S,"Do not get the 3 DVD set - get THIS one with the 4th training DVD. The 4th DVD has a lot of helpful information, which makes it a much better value, especially if you are looking to train your own dog.

The first 3 DVDs are extremely valuable to any dog owner, as well as entertaining to watch. But the 4th one is the only one that actually gives point-for-point instruction on how to train your own dog. All 4 are packed with useful information.",1258502400,14,446,4.186046511627907
3913702,5,B002DXU54S,"As prospective dog adopters, we've only watched one dvd so far (the one about adopting a dog from a shelter or similar situation)--it was extremely helpful. We were in the process of adopting a dog (with issues) from a neighbor, and realized after watching the dvd that we were considering the wrong dog for our situation.

As it turned out, the neighbor changed his mind about letting his dog be adopted, and we were relieved -- after watching Cesar's dvd, we learned a lot about how to choose a dog that would be much better suited to us, and how to introduce the dog into our home & avoid many mistakes of new owners.

Of course, we still have not adopted our dog, so we haven't put this information to the test. . .but it's a lot of common sense, and I think it will be very helpful when we do go to the shelter to get our dog!",1257638400,4,831,4.220125786163522
3913703,4,B002DXU54S,"I ordered these dvd's to help with training a new puppy.  Cesar has a style I admire and hope to achieve.  I have a 5 month old puppy and 13 year old dog, so the age range is significant, but the dvd's pertained to both dogs.  I was hoping for more inside training for puppies than what was offered.  Cesar's explanation of bad behaviors and suggestions for changes were the most significant items.  Worth the money for sure.  I have learned a lot and will watch again and again for reinforcement and review.",1252540800,17,508,4.408602150537634
8366227,5,B002DXU54S,We Rescue and foster dogs and cats for a local non profit. This series gave us some good tips that worked well and worked quickly as we don't have a lot of time to work with some animals before we find their forever homes.,1458864000,,222,4.068181818181818

8366229,5,B002DXU54S,"I got these dvds  to help me with our new puppy.  We have had dogs in the past, but this is our first really stubborn dog we have ever had. I needed all of the help that I could get, so I had seen Cesar on tv and decided to order these dvds.  If you like his shows you will like these dvds. I didn't learn a lot but I did learn some.",1337904000,,333,3.5342465753424657
8366230,2,B002DXU54S,If you have watched any of Ceasers shows you will not get much more from these videos. They are not very specific they are more about attitde which was not what I was looking for.,1295049600,,179,4.142857142857143
8366231,3,B002DXU54S,"Don't  get me wrong, Cesar Millan  is incredibly gifted in his passion. I've never seen his shows, but he came highly recommended by several different people. He DEFIANTLY put me on the right path to ""pack leader"".  I did not care so much for the other trainer's styles. Only three stars, because I was expecting A LOT MORE step-by-step individual training, especially for the price I paid.",1266969600,,390,4.791044776119403
8366232,5,B002DXU54S,"If you've ever seen the TV show, you know the gist... Cesar is a great instructor, telling you what you need to know for your specific dog. Make sure to get the 4 DVD set rather than the 3 DVD set, includes the latest disc.",1265932800,,223,3.977777777777778
8366233,4,B002DXU54S,"we bought this product because we like the show and thought more in depth videos would help and we could view them whenever we wanted. there is a little bit about how to train a puppy that is really helpful like which order to teach commands, how to keep their attention and get them to listen. for these sessions cesar meets up with professional dog trainers becuase as he says in the video "" i am not a trainer i am a rehabilitator"" but all in all a very good investment, recently borrowed them to a friend they were impressed with how our dog behaves and wants to train theirs better :)",1265673600,,589,4.267857142857143
8366234,3,B002DXU54S,"I got this video-set hoping it would actually SHOW me cesar's instructions in action in addition to his books but I wasn't that impressed.  They had some helpful tips & stuff, but it's def not a substitute to reading the books.  I don't think I'd buy it again now that I've seen it.  The book (his most recent one) is way more informative.",1264896000,3,339,4.349206349206349
8366235,4,B002DXU54S,"If you're a fan of Cesar Millan's TV show ""The Dog Whisperer"", much of the info here will be familiar. While the techniques are solid and his consistent approach to dog psychology works, I was hoping for more specific training/trick tips from Cesar in video 4.

The 4th disc consists primarily of other trainers techniques, some of which do not always follow the model put forth by Cesar himself. The title ""Sit Stay the Cesar Way"" is a bit misleading, because he does not actually present the lessons, but rather sits in on other trainers sessions. He asks questions of them to better connect his methodology, but something seems lacking.

His touch with dogs often seems magical, but the other trainers reminded me of the old-fashioned repetitious way to train a dog. The positive lesson learned here is that there is no single best way to train, and owners must find what works best for them. All in all, the information in the series results in a clear and simple understanding of basic dog obedience and I would still recommend it to others.",1264377600,2,1046,4.7103825136612025
8366236,5,B002DXU54S,"I have watched Cesar for several years now.  I got this for Christmas and just finished viewing volume 4. I found choosing a dog/puppy to be very insightfully as I plan on getting a puppy sometime next year. As well as what you should do before you take puppy/dog home and what you should do before you bring them into their new home. Which is of course is take them for a walk. I truly think anyone thinking of getting a new puppy/dog really needs to view volume 3. Maybe we would have fewer dogs surrendered if more people got a dog that matched their energy level and/ or the energy level of their household, taking into account all the people that live there. The dog training was also insightfully I think the thing that stuck out the most was Martin  said something on the lines of you have to find what works for your dog. I've done quite a bit of research into training methods and it seems the are many out there that feel it's their way or the highway.

To have this open minded attitude and to be able to go with the flow is what a good trainer truly needs because not all methods work for all dogs, ya just got find the one that works for your pet.",1262044800,2,1160,4.192825112107624
