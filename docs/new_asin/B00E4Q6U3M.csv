8601009,5,B00E4Q6U3M,"I just bought Neil Sedaka ""The Complete Singles &  Ep's from 50's/60's and came across his live performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. I thought this would be Neil with a band and back-up singers just like the records. I couldn't have been more wrong. It was just Neil and a grand piano for almost 21/2 hours. What a concert. He played all his big hits and then some. There were a couple of surprises around the middle of his performance plus he did a medley of classical music towards the end. I was glued to the screen. He never took a break for the entire show. I believe he was in his seventies when he did this incredible concert and having been to the Royal Albert Hall many years ago I could appreciate the atmosphere and acoustics. This Blu-Ray is a must for all Neil Sedaka fans. If your not yet a fan you will be!",1414022400,4,832,4.232704402515723
8601010,5,B00E4Q6U3M,"Im a great fan of Neil Sedaka. Audio and video from Eagle Rock has always liven up to its name. Superb production. At his age, he delivered all his greatest hits with ease. A very enjoyable evening he had with his audience at the RAH. His piano playing was very entertaining that keeps you wanting to tap your feet as you sing along. Great blu ray to own if you have not had one of Neil's.",1399766400,3,389,4.131578947368421

8601012,1,B00E4Q6U3M,I expected at least a 3 piece band and him.  This one is for REAL fans.  Didn't seize the opportunity to REVITALIZE his music.,1386288000,,126,4.208333333333333
8601013,4,B00E4Q6U3M,"This is a solo performance and Neil Sedaka looks like a senior citizen but his singing and piano playing are inspired and brought a tear or two to my eyes.  Some of the beautiful songs include Solitaire, the Immigrant, I Should Have Never Let You Go,  Breaking Up is Hard to Do (I prefer the slow version however).  They don't write songs like this today.",1379894400,,355,4.430769230769231
