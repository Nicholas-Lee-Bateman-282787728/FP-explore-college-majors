1736993,1,B00006ADGP,"Because this was a remarkable and sensitive film, I purchased the DVD as soon as I saw it on Amazon. Big mistake!
This is an inferior product that almost destroys this beautiful film!  I feel ripped off.  Now I see that there are many reviews here that warned the buyer to beware, but I didn't think to read them because I knew and loved the film and didn't stop to think that the DVD itself might be a poor product.  I've learned my lesson.  I started to show the DVD to my students and was horrified at what had been done to the film. Not only is the quality of the image unacceptable, but the amateurish dubbing destroys the performances of the wonderful actors. Terrible, and a great disservice to a beautiful work.",1360281600,,719,4.383458646616542
1736994,1,B00006ADGP,So not worth it. A very poor quality. Not to mention its dubbed over in English. Looks like it was copied from VHS.,1359244800,,115,4.043478260869565
1736995,1,B00006ADGP,"I was considering buying this because the image showed the original cover and the descriptor indicated that it is subtitled - both facts leading me to believe that I'd be purchasing the original, not the dubbed version. I'm glad I read the reviews which advised otherwise. What's of greater concern, however, is that the first review pointing out this problem was written in 2005, and the most recent in 2011. So, 6 years of feedback to Amazon about this inaccurate information and still no change. Thanks to those of you who set me straight.",1315008000,,542,4.776595744680851
1736996,5,B00006ADGP,"Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni 1977

The Rally for Hitlers visit with Mussolini in Fascist Rome Italy provides the back drop for a chance encounter between two neighbors from across an italian palazzo. Though only a courtyard apart, they live in two different worlds;  one of an unappreciated housewife; and the other of a lonely bachelor.  This special day brings together a man who feels less a man, and a woman who feels less a woman and in the course of that day,  the two manage to navigate uncomfortable sexual attraction, rejection, politics and a snoopy old land lady.  This is a loving film about how people in the midst of a huge building full of people, and the fascist fervor that often looses the individual, manage to find some heart felt honesty after the polite facade drops, and they confront their inner shadows, and share them with each other.  Given the subject matter, and that this was made in 1977, it was fairly ahead of its time, and both actors give two of their most lovely performances.  Pay no attention to the critics who can't see past a pour DVD transfer, or the dubbing; yes a better copy would be wonderful; yes, if it was in italian with subtitles it might be even better, but once you get past all that, you will find that these two seasoned actors will take you on a subtle ride into their hearts and minds, and make you remember that in a crowd there are real people, with real stories.",1305417600,,1431,4.544747081712062
1736997,1,B00006ADGP,"I watched this horrible rendition of a badly dubbed, lousy VHS copy of an originally fine film and thanked God I didn't buy the DVD---which has to be a Chinese knockoff.  This is what NetFlix is sending out to customers.  I told them about it.  No info on the disc but the title and that's it!  Isn't this what the FBI wants to know about?  I wonder if Sophia knows about this.",1295740800,,377,4.180555555555555
1736998,5,B00006ADGP,"Study of discontent and marginalization, more than Mussolini's (or Hitler's) political crimes, it's also a representation of ordinary life in Rome before the Second World War becomes the nightmare it will become.",1221350400,,212,5.65625

1737001,1,B00006ADGP,"A Special Day is a masterful film by Ettore Scola. This version, dubbed into English, although clearly advertised as ""in Italian"", is a horrible copy. Do not purchase this copy!.

1737002,1,B00006ADGP,"DO NOT waste money on this item. This is a transfer made directly from a videotape. The quality is very poor. The image is soft and its colors bleed. Contrary to the item's description for the DVD as having subtitles, the DVD has an English voice over dubbed on top of the Italian soundtrack which makes it extremely annoying to listen to. The DVD is not subtitled.",1197331200,,365,4.462686567164179
1737003,1,B00006ADGP,"The recording quality is so low that it seems as if it was transferred from an ordinary VHS and dubbed in English. Even the original soundtrack is not avaliable!

1737005,3,B00006ADGP,"the history is only a background in this film casting sophia loren & marcello mastroianni as a depressed middle aged housewife and a depressed middle aged gay man thrown together in rome on the day when hitler pays an official state visit to mussolini. this is a great movie, but i cant recommend it to anyone who did not see it in its theatrical release. why? because this dvd is of a horrid print dubbed into english! no actor of such import has been as badly served in the dvd market as has sophia loren, several of whose greatest movies (""two women"", ""yesterday today & tomorrow"", ""el cid"", this) are available only on dreadful transfers. PLEASE somebody get decent transfers made; ""a special day"" deserves to get 5 stars, but not til its viewable.",1146700800,,752,4.619402985074627
1737006,4,B00006ADGP,"Una Giornata Particolare is one of my favorites movies ever. I was very dissapointed about the dub and the bad image. It seems that it was record straight from a TV set. It looks like an illegal copy.

It is amazing how an excellent movie can be harm without scruples!",1130198400,,268,4.36
1737007,5,B00006ADGP,"This film released in 1977,  directed by Ettore Scola and starring Sophia Loren (Antonietta) and Marcello Mastroianni (Gabriele) was ahead of its time in its sensitive handling of homosexuality. The events take place during the space of one day, a ""special day,"" when Hitler and Mussolini have a huge rally in Rome. Practically the entire city turns out for the event. While Antonietta's boorish husband and their six children-- he's anxious to have a seventh child-- go to the event, she stays home and meets a neighbor (Gabriele) when her parrot escapes from her window and lights on a ledge outside Gabriele's apartment. What follows is a beautiful story of two very different people whose lives touch each other briefly, and both of them are the better for it. The gentle Gabriele is totally different from and in stark contrast to Antonietta's brutish, selfish husband who is also a ""father"" and a ""soldier."" Of course Gabriele is none of these but rather a quiet, sensitive soul who reads and lives in a neat, tastefully furnished apartment.

Juxtaposed with the beautiful encounter of these two individuals is the constant martial music and speeches that are broadcast all over the City of Rome glorifying these two dictators. The film is ultimately optimistic-- at least mildly-- however, as Gabriele says that ""life is worth living.""

Loren and Mastroianni, both attractive and fine actors, give the kinds of performances we expect from them. Even as a tired housewife who wears Eleanor Roosevelt shoes, Ms. Loren is still incomparably beautiful.",1129593600,,1555,5.090196078431372
1737008,4,B00006ADGP,I loved the movie but the dvd quality is one of the worst ever seen. It looks like a pirated copy; even the frames run every now and then.,1119744000,,138,3.793103448275862
1737009,1,B00006ADGP,"Sadly, this is a perfectly awful copy, possibly from a VHS tape. The voices are also dubbed rather than subtitled. It is actually All Region rather than Region 1, as the Amazon description says. Scola deserves better than he has gotten for his many fine films. Why doesn't Criterion do a Scola collection?

2017: My review was sort of prescient. This grand movie is now available for streaming on Criterions collaborative service, FilmStruck. There is also some other Scola, including my favorite, La Nuit De Varennes.",1119312000,,518,5.023255813953488
1737010,5,B00006ADGP,"In the middle of the fascist Italy every people has to live or apparent it. Many of them are devoted admirers of  Benito: fervent followers of his charisma and incandescent speeches. In this state of things you don't realize about those little details such be kind with your wife or to be worried by your son : they are minor issues when the Big Brother invites you to another spelling encounter, the mighty crowd will become the combustible for the solemn ego, the silence and the fear simply disappear when he talks: the collective flattening the individual will. That's the way.

But fortunately not everybody likes this totalitarian proposal: a solitaire and unsatisfied woman decides not  to assist to the great occasion. She is simply an outsider, far from the statistics.  In the other hand a refined man, neglected by his sexual condition renounces also to be part of the absurd mass spectacle. The stage is propitious for the unavoidable encounter: two human beings linked by few common aspects but really important: every one of them values each other. She is a housewife a simple woman who suffers in silence the weight of the indifference, who cares about less than nothing the outdoors politics  while her life is a real hell of ingratitude and respect; she is simply an object.

These are the basic premises employed admirably by Ettore Scola  to make a colossal film plenty of little details: the fine dialogue, the  discrete eye camera  searching for the intimacy, the inner conflict of both, furtive and unhappy. But they will build though brief instants, the life's magic: to feel loved without worrying by tomorrow.

This poetic film is loaded with expressive pulse and superb distinction, maintaining its status and its multiple virtues that seemed to revalue it through the years. Superb tour de force acting for one of the most famous couples in the screen: Sophia Loren as the unhappy woman and Marcello as the outsider. a sensitive and repudiated human being but filled of details to give and share.

Watch this golden film. This is the supreme masterpiece of Ettore Scola!",1111190400,,2097,4.912181303116148

It did not arrive with this cover, the audio and the visual were distorted and almost impossible to understand. It is really a shame because this is one of Ettore Scola finest work and certainly doesn't deserve to be handled this way!! Shame on this seller. My I hate it rating is certainly not for the original film but for the unethical handlind of this masterpiece. Their attitude I assume, anything for making a profit and I certainly do not want to contribute to their plan!!!
