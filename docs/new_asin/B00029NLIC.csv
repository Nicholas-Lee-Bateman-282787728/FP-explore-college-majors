These three don't exactly equal a Jack Ncholson triple feature, as he only has a cameo in LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, as a masochistic dental patient. This Roger Corman dark comedy and THE WILD RIDE are b&w. Corman's THE TERROR has an in-color gothic quality but seems like two different movies, due to a pair of directors, one working with each star (Nicholson and Boris Karloff) in two separate parts of the story.
.

THE WILD RIDE is a morality tale that concerns a group of circa 1960 Lost Generation types who spend their days drinking, partying and coupling. Jack is the gang's leader, a hot rod racer banned from the dirt tracks for his reckless driving. When he takes this bad habit to the streets, there's tragic consequences.

THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is about a flower shop employee, a nebbish who crossbreeds a fast-growing plant from a Venus flytrap. In Mushnick's backroom, ""Little Audrey"" quickly develops into a man-eating monster that frequently whines, ""Feed me!"" An amusing little film with several quirky characters that Corman cranked out in three days and then forgot about (thus it fell into the public domain), ""Little Shop"" has long ago reached cult status. It's even spawned an '80s musical version.

Although disjointed, at least THE TERROR does have atmosphere (little else, though). Here, Jack is a French lieutenant who, instead of returning to his troops, becomes fascinated with a silent young lady (Sandra Knight), an obsession that ultimately takes him to Boris Karloff's creepy castle. Karloff, as elderly Baron Von Lepp, denies the mysterious woman is there, but he shows Jack a painting of his long-dead wife that looks just like girl. Then Karloff tells just how his wife died (it wasn't from natural causes). Jack refuses to believe the girl he's seen and followed is a ghost. He's determined to find her again.
