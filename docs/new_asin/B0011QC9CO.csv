8242149,5,B0011QC9CO,"I usually don't write reviews, but I need to get the rating up on this classic Thomas DVD.

For all of you who don't know, this is a re-release of the VHS tape ""Daisy"" released in 1993. Although it is kind of sneaky of them to change the title of the release, it's a much needed DVD of classic stories. As much as I love the old VHS tapes, let's face the facts, they're a dying breed. It's hard to find VCRs working and even more difficult to get them to work right with modern TVs. It's so easy to be able to pop a DVD into my computer and watch the same thing it would take hours of setting up to watch in VHS form.

As for this whole ""This isn't appropriate for kids"" ordeal, that's just overly conscious new parents trying to act like the mommy of the year. In other words, crap. I'm nearly 20 now and grew up with all these tapes. I've been a Dean's list student and am currently in enrolled in a good university with many friends. Obviously my psyche was not permanently damaged and derailed by hearing the word ""stupid"" at a young age and I was not inclined to act out and become a problematic child based on the thoughts and opinions of some colorful talking trains I saw on PBS. People need to relax. In the real world, people are going to say much worse things than ""stupid"" so might as well prepare the kids.",1371686400,,1319,4.1686274509803924
8242150,1,B0011QC9CO,"The problem I have with this video is the fact that in a segment, Percy calls a danger warning board 'stupid'. Here is the transcript from the video that I'm referring to:

Thomas: 'DANGER' means falling down something. I went past 'DANGER' once, and fell down a mine.
Percy: I can't see a mine.
Narrator: He didn't know that the foundations to the Quay had sunk, and that the rails now sloped downward to the sea.
Percy: Stupid board!

So call me old fashioned if you want and I don't consider my a prude, but I personally don't think I should be worried that a video made for small children may teach them words like 'stupid'. When I overheard this in the video, I though I misunderstood, so I rewound it to make sure I heard it right and sure enough when my son heard it the second time, he proceeded to mimic the phrase over and over, even at the grocery store. I finally got him to stop, but I was furious about it. I won't let him watch it again and will try to get a refund from the Thomas parent company since the store I bought it at won't give refunds on opened videos. I suggest a DON'T BUY on this one.",1215129600,2,1114,4.176744186046512
8242151,1,B0011QC9CO,"They just repackaged some old episodes, the colors are not bright and definitely not HD. The kids don't mind at all, but I always feel cheated, 99% of newly released Thomas DVDs are just old episodes.

8242152,2,B0011QC9CO,Do not get fooled by the release date on this DVD. Don't get me wrong. The stories are as good as always. But the actual production are probably in the late 80s or early 90's. But after watching those more recent Thomas release DVD you'll not be interest in watching those old productions.,1206057600,6,289,4.471698113207547
