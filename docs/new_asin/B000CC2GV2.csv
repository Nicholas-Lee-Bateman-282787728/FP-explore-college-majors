8096821,5,B000CC2GV2,"This video about the basics of using the shotgun for self-defense.  On this video you will find what the basic parts of the shotgun are, loading and unloading, modifications to your shotgun along with shooting drills, patterning, and much more.  While some of the material is very basic to anyone who shoots, there is something here for almost anyone.  As a plus Mr. Magill even includes field stripping procedures for several common guns (Remington 870, Mossberg 500, etc.).  All in all this a good reference tool and a perfect starting point for beginner.",1351641600,,557,4.956989247311828
8096822,2,B000CC2GV2,"NOT recommended unless you are already a shotgun safety expert who can detect when somebody shows you a really bad technique. The DVD set has its pros and cons. Unfortunately when talking about firearm safety the shortcomings in a poorly taught lesson can get you killed. In my copy of this DVD the teacher for example correctly emphasizes that every gun should be considered loaded and dangerous at all times and that you should never point the muzzle at anyone. Then he places his own shotgun against his chair with the barrel pointed toward his head. Soon you notice that the barrel has slid down and is pointed toward his chest. Meanwhile the trigger is in a position where just casually dropping his hand to his side could activate it by accident. He also points a shotgun at what he describes as ""a concrete floor"" inside a studio and pulls the trigger to make sure it is not loaded. I witnessed that procedure once in real life and the shotgun went off sending a metal slug ricocheting off the concrete and nearly killing someone. I suggest you learn gun safety from someone who is a gun safety expert before watching this DVD. ""Do as I say, not as I do"" is permissible in some cases but has no place in a DVD that claims to teach mastery of a lethal weapon.  - otherwise you risk picking up some bad habits that could be lethal.",1283385600,2,1336,4.475409836065574
8096823,3,B000CC2GV2,"I feel the need to warn people about the production quality of the video in certain areas.

1.  AMMUNITION SELECTION shows a quick graphic of the different sizes of pellets that are available and then goes into the dissection of 00 Buckshot.  That's it.  The segment fails to discuss slugs or 000 Buckshot

2.  DIS-ASSEMBLY AND REASSEMBLY has omitted the Remington 870.

3.  LIVE FIRE COMPARISONS has a graphic with the incorrect distance listed in the final exercise.  When discussing #4 Buckshot, the graphic continually spells it ""0000 Buck.""

4.  PENETRATION TESTS is extremely painful to watch, as the audio is horrendous!  The wind was blowing so hard, the audio is practically inaudible.  Instead of rescheduling the shoot, they decided to use the footage.  At the beginning of the segment, Lenny Magill talks about less lethal ammunition in which he says they discussed earlier in the ammunition segment...which never happened.

5.  The audio in LONG RANGE WITH SLUGS drops out completely half way through.  They put up a graphic of what Lenny Magill says, instead of re-shooting the segment.

6.  HOME DEFENSE consists of Lenny Magill discussing how to peek around a corner with your shotgun.  That's it.

Take this DVD for what it is, a general overview of the shotgun techniques, ammunition and breakdown.  I bought this DVD on clearance so I accept it for what it is.",1274486400,,1379,4.930131004366812
8096824,1,B000CC2GV2,"This video left a lot to be desired, and I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone. There are far better Defensive Shotgun videos available to spend your money on.

Aside from the production values, and sound quality in some sections of the video, there are numerous occasions where incorrect nomenclature is used (example - # 4 buckshot is consistently listed as ""0000 buck"". The word ""gauge"" is misspelled on the graphics throughout the video. This may seem insignificant, but in a SHOTGUN TRAINING video, the word ""gauge"" is pretty darn important.

The session on the ""vast array"" (or words to that effect) of shotgun ammunition available consists of Lenny slicing open a 00 buck shotshell and examining the components. That's it.

There is questionable gun handling practiced throughout the video. It advertises that it will show the viewer how to field strip a Remington 870 (far and away the most common ""Combat"" shotgun) but it does not.

There is some very old, and totally irrleveant footage of some sort of black powder firearms competition that has nothing at all to do with modern fighting shotguns.

As a pet peeve of mine, Lenny says ""alright ?"" so much throughout the video, that it became distracting. You're almost paying more attention to that than the educational part of the video. It became kind of like a drinking game after a while just waiting on the next ""alright ?""

The people who will order this video, I'm afraid, are new shotgun shooters who won't be able to recognize how much bad information is in here. This must also be where all the good reviews come from...people new to Defensive Shotgun concepts who don't have anything to compare this to and thus, believe it to be good.

Skip this one. Seriously. Order Clint Smith's or Tom Givens' Defensive Shotgun videos.",1235520000,8,1808,4.85064935064935
8096825,5,B000CC2GV2,"The Title, ""Mastering the Shotgun"", might be misleading to people who are already well acquainted and experienced in the use of shotguns.  It's more like a good introduction to combat shotguns, how they work and how to use them.  There is a lot of good information about shotguns in this DVD set.  It's great for the newbie and especially to those who don't yet own one because Lenny Magill displays and demonstrates several brand name models and the various shotgun ammunition available.  The person looking to buy a shotgun can watch this DVD and see which features and shotgun models he likes.

Mastering the Shotgun contains 3 DVDs in one case.

The Sub-menus of the disk provide a telling description of the contents on each disk.

DVD disk 1:
 Introduction

 Safety Concerns  (Safety rules and cautions)

  Nomenclature  (Lenny Magill displays 5-shotguns models manufactured by 4 different brand  names of shotguns.  He shows the parts of each shotgun and demonstrates their function and how  to load and unload each model.)

DVD disk 2:
 Ammunition selection

 Shotgun Competitions

 Handling and manipulation dry fire drills  (Here Lenny Magill recommends that new shotgun  owners use dummunition or snap caps, fake ammunition, to practice how to handle and use the  shotgun before ever putting in real ammunition.  This is practicing safely and it improves the gun  owner's skill when practiced correctly.  Lenny Magill demonstrates with use of snap caps how  to load, unload, how to hold the shot gun at high ready, port of arms, low ready, how to mount  from the ready position and aim at the target.

 Choke tubes and shot pattern effects

 Field Stripping (Lenny Magill demonstrates how to field strip 6 models of shotguns.  field stripping  is the disassembly of the weapon which is usually done to clean it.  The models he uses to  demonstrate field stripping are the Winchester 1300, Benelli nova pump, Mossberg 590, Mossberg  500, Benelli M-1 and M-4.
