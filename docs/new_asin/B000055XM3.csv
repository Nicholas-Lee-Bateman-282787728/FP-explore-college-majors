7931224,3,B000055XM3,"Good photography & settings.  Acting, plot, & technical aspects less so (e.g., snub-nosed revolvers shooting from a swiftly moving airborne helicopter, putting many holes in a moving Land Rover, finally blowing it up, and magically never running out of ammunition; South American native tribes of obvious African descent; idiomatic English language spoken by the ""undiscovered"" Amazon women, etc.).  Fortunately, the ladies were attractive and it was good to see Anita Ekberg, for which I gave it an additional star in this rating.  Overall, it had the look and feel of a TV series pilot, especially at the end where the principal male characters became partners and flew off in a Cessna, ostensibly to more adventures.",1526169600,,719,5.234782608695652
7931225,5,B000055XM3,"Early Mark Lester (Commando, Class of 1984, Rollerboogie, Firestarter) effort with a fascinating cast well worth a look.
Lester obviously didn't take this too seriously, and you shouldn't either. Heck, it's a TV movie from 1979 that opens with Amazon archers running around in New York City. It's got action, humor, a few surprises, and a great acting moment from Donald Pleasence when he finally discovers the first of the fabled cities. Bo Svenson anticipates Nick Nolte with his grizzled explorer character who's really a good guy underneath his gruff exterior. The leather-bikini Amazons are cute, although most of them are quite skinny (I imagine the casting director had a thing for skinny ladies). The whole production is quick-paced and good-natured. Pop a beer and enjoy.",1523145600,,780,5.198412698412699
7931226,4,B000055XM3,"Ridiculous movie!  I quite enjoyed it.  My cheeks were sore from smiling when it was over.  Anita Ekberg was appropriately queen-sized, Bo Svenson gave his role just the amount of dismissal it deserved, and no helicopters were exploded in the making of this film.",1522195200,2,263,4.931818181818182

7931228,2,B000055XM3,"all during this movie i was asking myself ""Was this really released?""  i just don't remember the 70's as putting up with this nonsense

on the plus side, great cinematography, well filmed

otherwise, atrociously bad.  not quite bad enough to be campy, but pushing it.  horrible plot, weak acting (from competent actors!),",1518998400,,321,5.096153846153846

7931233,1,B000055XM3,"Gold , Amazon , Women .. any movie with such elements should become quite a thriling adventure unless it is this movie .
Starting from the lame script and less then B-movie acting , this movie is so boring and the little action is ridicules .
Sometimes it is so bad it is funny like when someone is supposed to be flying in a helicopter but you see stand still tree reflection on the window .
The production is very poor with teribble locations , customs and extras (apperntly the Amazonas is populated by Africans) and to top it all the sound is bad and the picture quality worse (with lots of ""snow"" in the beggining) .
This title is so bad it gives bad name to all other B-movies , stay away from this one .",1002844800,15,710,4.189781021897811
