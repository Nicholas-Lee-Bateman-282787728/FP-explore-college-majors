8739367,5,B0007MF0OW,"I recently came across Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry on HBO, and was amazed at the passion that came out of the artist that perform these poems.  I'll note to people who feel that this is just a typical poetry reading where everyone sits quietly and spouts boring couplets, well it isn't.  The variety of these pieces is astounding, from pollitical poems, rape poems, to poems that celebrate life, all you could ever want is located right in this dvd set.  I also recomend that you purchase all the other seasons of Def Poetry.  In Short this program, shows how wonderful and powerful art expression is in todays world.",1142899200,,625,4.706422018348624
