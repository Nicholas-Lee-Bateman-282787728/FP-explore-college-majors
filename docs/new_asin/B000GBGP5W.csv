8130346,3,B000GBGP5W,"""The Spanish Main"" is a 1945 Technicolor pirate film starring Paul Henried, Maureen O'Hara and Walter Slezak with Binnie Barnes and Barton MacLane.

Maureen O'Hara (1920) plays the daughter of the Spanish Ambassador to Mexico who is kidnapped by pirate leader Paul Henreid. O'Hara lit up the screen at 19 as Esmeralda in ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939). She could play comedy (""Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), or action (""Bagdad"" in 1949) and she did 5 films with Wayne - ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), and ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957). In this film she does her usual great job.

Austrian born Paul Henreid (1905-92) will forever be the besieged Victor Laszlo from ""Casablanca"" (1942) or Jerry Durrance lighting two cigarettes at once from ""Now Voyager"" (1942), despite his more than 40 other films. Henried was a victim of the communist scare and was blacklisted as an actor, turning his attentions to directing and work on stage. Henreid is OK, but he's no Errol Flynn or Burt Lancaster.

Walter Slezak (1902-83) was a great character actor who appeared in more than 50 films, often as a villain (e.g., ""Lifeboat"", ""Born to Kill"") but he did well in comedies (e.g., ""The Pirate"", ""The Inspector General"") and musicals,  and won a Tony for ""Fanny"". He plays the corrupt Governor of Cartagena, who is engaged to O'Hara. Slezak is at his sleaziest best and steals every scene in which he appears.

Binnie Barnes (1903-98) plays a female pirate and Henreid's love interest (before he meets O'Hara).. Barnes was a major star of the 30s, appearing in ""Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933),  ""Diamond Jim"" (1935), ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1936) and ""3 Musketeers"" (1939). Her philosophy was - ""I'm no Sarah Bernhardt. One picture is just like another to me as long as I don't have to be a sweet woman.""

Barton MacLane (1902-69) plays a pirate and a rival to Henreid. MacLane is best remembered as the General from ""I Dream of Jeannie"" (1965-70). He and Bogart often appeared in films together (""The Maltese Falcon"", ""San Quentin"", ""High Sierra"", ""All Through the Night"", ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"").

The film's director Frank Borzage (1893-1962) started as an actor in silent films and then became a director. He was heavily influenced by German director F.W. Murnau with whom he worked. He won the Oscar for ""7th Heaven"" (1927) - the first time an Oscar was ever given - and ""Bad Girl"" (1931). Borzage made a variety of films, but military films were the single largest group (13) including ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1932) ""Three Comrades"" (1938), ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940), ""Stage Door Canteen"" (1943), ""Till we Meet Again"" (1944), and ""China Doll"" (1958).

1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included: Joan Crawford's Oscar winning ""Mildred Pierce"" and film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".

The NY Times said ""it has all the old business of fanciful swashbuckling films, repeated as though this sort of make-believe hadn't been played a hundred times before."" Despite the lack of critical enthusiasm, the film made more than $1 million at the box office and was a hit, resulting in more Technicolor adventure films.

IMO the best Pirate films are Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), The Sea Hawk (1940), Captain Blood (1935), Treasure Island (1934), Peter Pan (1953), The Crimson Pirate (1952), Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), The Black Swan (1942), and Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kid (1952).

Bottom line - a good pirate film, but not among the top 10. Fans of O'Hara and Slezak will find a lot to enjoy.",1343865600,,3835,4.910355486862442
8130347,5,B000GBGP5W,This classic movie is a jewell.  It is a shame that it is unavailable in the dvd format.  The movie is a good love story and priate movie.  It reflects good verses evil and true friendship.  The movie is a must for your movie library.  Maureen O'Hara and Paul Henreid's acting in this movie is very good making their parts very believable. The supporting actors bring comedy to the movie.  This is a very good movie.,1335139200,,416,4.407894736842105
8130348,5,B000GBGP5W,The dvd of the spanish main brought back memeriesofwhen I went to the movies on a Saturday afternoon when I was young.  I loved watching it again.  Robmaree.  PS:  Barabara Stanwyck never appeared in this movie,1245283200,,210,4.75

adventures, this is a good movie.  Highly recommend.",1222214400,,118,5.157894736842105
8130350,5,B000GBGP5W,"If you haven't seen this movie and you love pirates, you have overlooked a jewel.  This has been one of my favorite movies my whole life.  You will love this -- classic good guy playing a bad guy, misunderstanding between hero and heroine, valiant rescues by friends thought to have been traitors, etc.  Always a fun ride, and somehow, never stale.  Just a pure delight!",1186531200,4,370,4.6461538461538465
8130351,3,B000GBGP5W,"I have this movie on VHS tape from a movie channel, and this DVD edition has been cut.  It's a fun swashbuckling film, but I was disappointed that the movie was edited.",1174003200,7,168,4.25
8130352,3,B000GBGP5W,"I just finished watching this movie, and here's my observations:

The costumes are beautiful, especially Maureen O'Hara's gowns.  The sets are okay, not great, not bad.  The swordplay is more than adequate.  The sea battles were fun.  The acting is pretty good.  The hero, played by Paul Heinreid, wasn't especially attractive to me, but to each their own.  I very much enjoyed the pistol duel between Francesca & Ann.  Walter Slezak almost stole the show with his 'pleasingly plump' performance.

The only thing I found that I was really disappointed in was the lack of opening credits - ""The Spanish Main"" title is not shown, nor are the actors & actresses names.  At the end of the movie, ""The End"" is barely shown, the music doesn't even finish before the shutdown, it's just suddenly cut, as if your electricity had suddenly been shut off due to power failure.

Overall, I'm glad I purchased the movie, it's great swashbuckling fun, however, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it from a seller who is asking too much - I paid less than $10.00 on Ebay and I'm glad I did.  This movie  would have got 4 stars from me if the title & credits and closing credits had not been unceremoniously chopped off.  Still, I'm grateful to the Chinese video company who put this movie on dvd, even if it meant a slightly rushed procedure when all was said & done.",1170633600,9,1349,4.637130801687764
