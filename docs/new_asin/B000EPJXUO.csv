8112549,4,B000EPJXUO,"This is THE package to get if you want to learn your 5D Classic in-depth. And, I mean in-depth. I can't think of anything more they could have put in. I give it a 4 because when they're showing how monochrome works they use a very busy ice cream sundae sitting on top of some leaves and it looks a mess. To actually show what monochrome and sepia look like they should have included at least one portrait which is what most people use monochrome and sepia for.

Also, the main presenter talks a mile a minute and it's between extremely hard and next to impossible to keep up, but they're dvds so you can easily playback or pause while you catch up, which I did many times. I don't exactly know how long the 2 dvds are together, but I couldn't be happier with the content because of how comprehensive the content is. My head is jam-packed now with 5D camera data and the dvds gave me confidence to just pick up the scary thing :-) and just start shooting. That's what I did right after following the dvd directions showing in great detail (as well as explaining why) how to set-up the camera.

The seller is the seller to end all sellers. The first set had a problem and she was on it in a second making sure all was taken care of to my satisfaction and that the second set was perfect.",1348704000,,1285,4.240816326530612
8112550,5,B000EPJXUO,"Gentlemen:
I want to thank you for your DVD on the Canon 5D. I am an old-school film
boy who has shot Canons for about 30 years. My first step into digital was
tentative with a 10D. I just got the 5D, and it is great. Your hands-on, and
visual, training was enjoyable. Much of it I knew, but there were nuggets to
pull out of your project. For an average photographer, your DVD would be
invaluable.
I wrote the Complete Idiot's Guide to Photography and the Pocket Idiot's
Guide to Photography for Alpha (Simon & Schuster). My reason for writing is
to thank you for providing what you promised. It is often missing in the
present world of publishing. I have written 98 books and am a book producer
working with major publishers, so I am talking from experience. You guys are
good, and I will tell my contacts of your products.
Again, thank you.
