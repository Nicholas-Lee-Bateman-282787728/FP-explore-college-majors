4992722,5,B006J6CFCA,"I've been waiting years for this to come out on DVD after first watching the original 1986 version on an old video when I was living and teaching English in Hamamatsu, Japan.  The films it samples aren't the greatest, but they are still fairly representative of the European, imitation George A. Romero zombie films of the early1980s.  It was actually my first exposure to some of these films when I was younger.  The fun part, though, is watching the cheesy, made-for-this-edition, in-between scenes that tied the whole zombie film fest thing together in the theater.  Not for those who can't get past the lack of modern digital special effects.  Although, the shark sequence in 'Zombie' used a real shark with an actual stuntman in zombie makeup for its underwater shark / zombie battle, something you really wouldn't see in modern films at all today.

The cut scenes star Karrene Janyl Claudle, Tracy Burton, Paula Singleton, Janelle Lewis and Janessa Lester.  In the film, a bunch of zombies (and a couple of victims as well) gather for a friendly afternoon at the El Rey movie theater, in California, to watch clips from various other zombie films, such as: 'Zombie' (also called ""Zombi"", ""Zombie 2"", ""Zombi 2"" or ""Gli Ultimi Zombi"" in the original Italian, ""Zombie 2: The Dead Are Among Us"", ""Zombie Flesh Eaters"" or ""Zombie Flesh-Eaters"" in the UK, ""Island Of The Living Dead"", ""Island Of The Flesh-Eaters"", ""Zombie Island"", and ""Woodoo"" or ""WooDoo"" in Germany, 1979, 1980); 'Oasis Of The Zombies' (also called ""La Tumba De Los Muertos Vivientes"" in the original Spanish, ""LAbime Des Morts Vivants 'The Abyss Of The Living Dead', ""Bloodsucking Nazi Zombies"", and ""Le Tresor Des Morts Vivants 'Treasure Of The Living Dead'"", 1981, 1982, 1983, 2005, 2013); 'Fear' (""Murder Obsession (Follia Omicida)"" and ""L'Ossessione Vhe Uccide"" in the original Italian,  also called ""Murder Syndrome"" in the US, ""Delerium"", ""Paura"", ""Svenuto"" and ""Unconscious"", ""Himomurhaaja"" in Finland, ""Satans Altar"" and ""To Spiti Tou Tromou"" in Greece, and ""The Wailing"" world-wide, 1981, 2013); 'Zombie Lake' (also called ""Zombies Lake"" and ""Zombies Lake"", ""Le Lac Des Morts Vivants"" in the original French, and ""Oasis Of The Zombies"", 1980, 1981, 2001); 'Dr. Orloffs Invisible Monster' (""La Vie Amoureuse De L'Homme Invisible"" and ""Orloff Et L'Homme Invisible"" in the original French, ""Secret Love Life Of The Invisible Man"" in Canada, ""Das Schreckenshaus Des Dr. Orloff"" in Germany, ""Der Unsichtbare Tod"" and ""In Den Krallen Des Unsichtbaren"" in West Germany, ""Orloff Y El Hombre Invisible"" in Spain, ""The Invisible Dead"" and ""Orloff And The Invisible Man"" in the UK, ""Oi Erotikes Nyhtes Tou Aoratou Anthropou"" in Greece, ""Le Notti Erotiche Dell'Uomo Invisibile"" in Italy, and ""Love Life Of The Invisible Man"" and ""Orloff Against The Invisible Man"" in the USA, 1970, 1972); 'A Virgin Among The Living Dead' (also called ""Christina, Princess Of Eroticism"", ""The Erotic Dreams Of Christine"", ""A Young Girl Among The Living Dead"", and ""Zombie 4: A Virgin Among The Living Dead"", originally called ""La Nuit Des toiles Filantes"" in Belgium, ""Christina Chez Les Morts Vivants"", ""Christina, Princesse De L'rotisme"", and ""Une Vierge Chez Les Morts Vivants"", ""Une Vierge Chez Les Morts-Vivants"" in France, ""Das Grauen Von Schloss Montserrat"" in Germany, ""Eine Jungfrau In Den Krallen Von Zombies"" in West Germany; ""El Infierno De Los Sentidos"" in Argentina, ""Gli Zombi Cannibali"", ""I Desideri Erotici Di Christine"", and ""Una Vergine Tra I Morti Viventi"" in Italy, ""La Noche De Las Estrellas Fugaces"", ""Los Sueos Erticos De Christina"", and ""Virgen Entre Los Muertos Vivientes"" in Spain, and ""Mia Parthena Gia Tous Zontanous  Nekrous"" in Greece, 1971, 1973, 1978, 1981); and 'The Astro-Zombies' (starring John Carradine (February 5, 1906November 27, 1988) and Tura Satana (1938-2011), 1968).  Man, these films were re-relased under a lot of different names in the old days.

4992723,4,B006J6CFCA,"If you're not expecting state of the art special effects and don't disdain the melodramatic styles of older movies you'll probably enjoy this wild zombie montage featuring some of the most entertaining scenes from some of the worst zombie films ever made. Most of the clips are from movies of the late 60s - early 80s and their quality varies wildly (however I disagree with the other reviewer about the image quality being 'unwatchable').
 The segments that bridge some of the scenes were filmed just for this video and they tend to be very cheesy with zombies chasing women around. Still they are fun to watch and show that the creators weren't taking things too seriously (unlike a certain reviewer). There's a bit of blood and good gore on display but most of the scenes are not very gory, however the atmosphere in many of them is nice and creepy.
 Viewers are also treated to extended scenes of full nudity, especially in the extensive scenes where beautiful women swim around in 'Zombie Lake' with the undead fiends floating underneath them. People who take this thing too seriously and give harsh criticisms due to it being cheesy are missing the point. This isn't serious stuff by any means. It's all meant to simply entertain and that it does very well.",1376092800,4,1263,4.762557077625571
4992724,2,B006J6CFCA,"Well. It's not a movie and it's not a documentary. It's a string of clips from numerous zombie flicks interspersed with newly shot footage where various people end up in a movie theater with a bunch of zombies watching movies about.....zombies.

This is some pretty awful stuff. The zombie genre of film is no different than any other genre in that most of the movies are going to stink. Here they seem to have found the stinkers and decided to show us the suckiest scenes from them. Seems the producer was more interested in finding scenes featuring women with little or no clothing on which is how I came up with the two star rating. But the scenes they chose suggested the movies they were from were just as awful in their own right. And they couldn't even be bothered to find decent prints of the films they used. Some of these segments bordered on unwatchable. Had it not been for the women I would have turned this off half way through. Something else odd was that it seemed as though they took several random scenes from a given flick and edited them together. I couldn't figure why they chose the scenes they chose and, once edited, the viewer had little sense of what it was that they were supposed to be getting from it.

I recognized many of the titles used and some of them have decent enough reputations with a cadre of viewers but this still has a stench to it. If you want an eyeful of pretty women in various stages of undress then have at it. If you're a fan of the genre you won't see anything new here.",1349308800,11,1521,4.371024734982332
8499181,3,B006J6CFCA,"Most of the clips contain a little nudity. A couple contain full frontals but nothing up close. The clips are from the 70s, maybe some 80s. If you don't go into this movie expecting the clarity of todays films, it will be a nice little film.",1516492800,,241,4.260869565217392

8499190,3,B006J6CFCA,"""Zombiethon"" is a restoration of a film that uses restored films. This is a compilation of scenes from various Italian/foreign zombie films which include the famous zombies with no eyes, but walk around like they can see. It eliminates all those boring scenes we would skip over so we can see zombies feasting, getting killed, and going after naked women. They left in most of the nude scenes. So if you simply want the best of a half dozen different films. This is it.",1441670400,,469,4.595238095238095
