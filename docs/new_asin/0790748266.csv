115905,2,0790748266,"I am a devoted fan of Pokemon, despite my age (a whopping 16!). However, although I found the TV series entertaining (in a baffling, obsessive way), this feature lacks the charm, humor, and tone of the episodes and instead,  seems to be just winging it, exploiting the enormous success of the pokemon  phenomenon purely for corporate profit, without the care of an artist. Not  only is it crudely translated and dubbed (may I mention the some 20 minutes  cut? or the error on the pokemon names?), but the emotion behind the  original Japanese production is lost. And the whole ""fighting is  bad"" tirade? Come on! Much of the effort at emotional content resulted  in several mawkishly sentimental scenes. We don't need to be told; we want  to be shown. I'm aware that this film is directly mainly toward a younger  audience, but I don't think any less effort should be put forth to make it  a quality film. Hopefully, with the some $83 mill from this production, the  second pokemon movie will be handled with more tenderness. I (and I speak  for many others) will be waiting to applaud this summer's Pokemon  Revelation Lugia.",952041600,13,1126,4.742268041237113
115906,5,0790748266,"This is a great movie. Well technically, two movies.
Pikachu's Vacation: This is a cute short movie. It is about Pikachu, Togepi, and all of the other Pokemon who's Trainers are the main characters, going on a one day  vacation to a Pokemon playground called ""Pokemon Land"". After  everyone settles down, Togepi misses Misty and cries. After Bulbasaur calms  it down, a group of 4 Pokemon Cubone, Raichu, and two newly discovered  Pokemon- Marrill, and Snubble walk by talking loudly. In fear that Togepi  may awake, Pikachu's party of Bulbasaur, Suirtle, and Himself ask the crowd  to please quiet down. But they get angered. And thats where it all starts.  From then on, Pikachu's party face off against the other party, but an  emergency will stop the competition, and have team work save the victim of  the emergency- Charizard. It is a very cute little short movie aimed for  the younger Pokemon fans.
Mewtwo Strikes Back: This is a story about a  Pokemon named Mewtwo. He is the clone of the legendary Pokemon Mew. When  Mewtwo awakens, He is confused, but when he learns that his whole life is  an experiment, and that He was artificialy made just for an experiment for  Science, He grows sad, depressed, unloved, and enraged. He kills all the  Scientists in the lab including Dr. Smith-the head Scientist of the Mewtwo  project. Mewtwo then meets a promising Man. His name is Giovanni. He is the  leader of Team Rocket. Mewtwo hates Humans because of why they created Him,  and lusts for world domination over them. Giovanni promises Him world  domination, as His partner. Mewtwo excepts. Mewtwo is placed in armor  restraining His powers in case He were to grow angry and attack Giovanni.  In Team Rocket HQ and the Viridian Gym, Giovanni decieves Mewtwo, and uses  Him to test His skills, beat Trainers and hurt them and their Pokemon, and  to catch rare Pokemon for Team Rocket. Mewtwo realizes how He is being used  though and destroys Team Rocket HQ, and flys off. He lands in the rubble of  the lab He was created in, and takes of the armor that didn't already break  off when he flew off. Mewtwo then declares that He will dominate the world,  and will show the Human race His revenge, and show- The Wrath of Mewtwo.  Mewtwo's rage is shown then through His eyes. Then, when the prologue is  over, we are shown our hero Ash. He battles a Pirate wannabe, and  Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Pikachu lead Him to a win. But a Fearow His  recorded that with a camera on it's neck, whom is flying over Ash and  Friends. Mewtwo watches Ash. A mysterious beautiful lady, whom is Mewtwo's  servant, asks if She should send out a invitation to Him. A invitation to  what though? Something Mewtwo is behind... Ash and Friends recieve the  invitation from a Dragonite that works for Mewtwo! The invitation Has the  beautiful lady whom is Mewtwos's servant. She asks if the person who  recieved the letter would please attend Her masters party. The directions  are then shown. She then asks to please R.S.V.P. by checking off the  ""Yes"" or ""No"" blocks. All She says about Her master is  he is a powerful trainer looking for a challenge. They check off the  ""Yes"" box. Team Rocket stops Dragonite from taking off- by Jessie  stopping it with a frying pan. The letter is dropped and Team Rocket views  the hologram invitation card too. They decide to leave for the island which  is named ""New Island"" also.  And from on that point a incredible,  dramatic, dark, beautiful, funny, sad, happy epic adventure takes place  that even talked about the essence of life itself, and the wrong of war,  and fighting in general. MSB is aimed for the older viewers of Pokemon.
All in all, PV is a cute little adventure, that You will love, and MSB  is a beautiful story that will have You cry, as it did to Me. However MSB  has death, cloning, drama, essences of life and war, and deep drama, but is  the better movie, and I DONT distraught the younger fans from seeing  it-just the immature bratty ones.
Beautiful. 5 Stars

115907,5,0790748266,"We saw Pokemon the First Movie on the Premearing date, even though we were expecting millions of ""poke-fans"" it was rather empty at the theater we went to. Anyway this goes to all you Mom's & Dad's, This is a must movie if your childrens are fans of the Pokemania!  The movie is  just perfect as it explains all of how Mewtwo was created and why it is the  150th Pokemon.  P.S. Good LUck if you can find it at your local retailer because this movie will  sell out as soon as its released!",951436800,2,488,4.148936170212766
115908,5,0790748266,"First, I'll confess that I'm a 35 year-old Pikachu addict -- I can't explain it, and I've stopped bothering to try. If you like Pokemon at all, you'll love this film -- it has all the familiar characters and has a very  powerful storyline.
However: The Japanese version of this movie was  considerably longer, and much of it was cut for the U.S., including and  explanation of Pokemon and Trainers, scenes with other Mewtwos dying  because of failures by the scientists, and a better explanation of what the  heck Mew is doing.
Still, very good. If you don't know Pokemon, try the  first in the video series, ""Pikachu, I Choose You!"" and find out  for yourself what an adult can possibly like about it!",950918400,5,702,4.612903225806452

I rented this on Amazon, and it was so nice to relive the memories while showing my boyfriend a part of my childhood.  Somehow, he didn't watch Pokemon as a kid.  The first six Pokemon movies all had a Pikachu centric mini movie before the featured film, which is sadly missing on Amazon Video.  That is a good extra 10 minutes you are not getting if you opt to stream this.  Luckily, you can find some clips of it on YouTube, but they are at an inferior quality or dubbed.  That's the only reason I'm rating this at 4 stars instead of 5.",1471824000,,702,4.186567164179104

116279,4,0790748266,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. A lot of people dismiss it saying it's a non-violence PSA, but that's not really the case. The movie is primarily about Racism and Self-worth. The movie opens up with Mewtwo being created in a lab, awakening not knowing his purpose or his reason for just merely existing and at the end (spoiler) he comes to the conclusion that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant and that one's value is determined by the choices they make. That's a really good message for children and even adults to learn.

NOTE: For those having a hard time finding the Pikachu's Vacation mini-movie, it's not in the Special Features menu, it's actually in the Scene Selection menu.",1470355200,,701,4.841666666666667

116589,5,0790748266,"Please note: This is a late review. I purchased this movie back in 2010 when the price was nowhere near where it is right now.

Pokemon has always been one of my favorite animated series.  When this movie came out in theaters I was so ecstatic. On top of the movie you got a free Pokemon card! It was the exclusive Legendary Mew, super holographic card that wasn't even in English, remember? Oh man, I was so in love with it. Unfortunately, I ended up loosing that card a few months after receiving it.

Now with the movie, there was no question about it. I had to grab onto the nostalgia that was once and kind of still is my childhood. Once the movie arrived at my house, I took no hesitation to tear the packaging and grasped onto the box that held the remembrance. I proceed to enjoy the featured film that I once loved. I won't spoil this movie for the newer generations that are interested in this movie, so I won't go into my favorite scenes.

Do I recommend this movie? Yes I do. But Only if you're a fan of the original origin of Pokemon or want to experience the movie yourself. You may not have the same feelings towards this movie as to the generation that was exposed to it original, but i feel its still enjoyable. Of course this is coming from a reviewer from the age of the Pokemon vs Digimon fan battle days.",1444262400,,1325,4.266932270916334

116620,5,0790748266,"This is one of the best pokemon moives ever made. This moive is just so amazing. In fact in 1998,when the moive was coming out,it was on the news!

Summary-This moive is about mewtwo. Mewtwo was created by team rocket scientists. Mewtwo was used fora tool,so it flew of. Giovanni,team rocket boss,uses mewtwo to obey him. Once again,mewtwo went to find a destiny. Ash and his friends are invited to meet mewtwo and now ash is in a big battle.....
This moive was good,but the ending is so sad. Ash was killed when mew and mewtwo attack him. Ash dies and all the pokemon cry for him. The music is to touching. This was such  a sad scean...

But,this moive has a great fight scean. Pokemon punching,kicking,scratching,birding each other. But it is also sad because mewtwo is putting so much pressure on the poor pokemon. In some shots,mew and mewtwo are seen shoving into each other with their psychic bubbles.

This moive also has pikachus vacation. A short flim about pikachu making new friends. It's just about how pokemon are like. And some facts about them.

This moive is highly recommended for anyone who likes pokemon. This is the best pokemon moive. It has such a good story. Plus,mew is so cute!!!! Anyway,this is a moive for pokemon fans or anime lovers.",1414627200,,1262,4.666666666666667

Mew is the best movie! Ash shows that no matter what you do to animals, their will always be someone that will take their side and that they will stand up for the animals, Ash sacrifices himself to save Mew and Mewtwo from each other, and then in return Mewtwo sees that Ash is friends with his Pokemon. Yes i still cry when Ash turns to stone, when i have kids this will be on of the movies that they will get to seen and not any of this Pokemon X and Y - the original is the BEST!!!",1391040000,,727,3.8859060402684564

Recently, this DVD's price has gone WAY up. New, un-opened DVDs are rare now and are quite expensive. I have the VHS but I just bought the DVD finally, used ""like new"" around $35.
My DVD's case is the cheap kind - mostly cardboard with only a plastic flap to seal it. That was a little annoying for the price, but the real jewel is the film, not the case.

I love this movie, because I love Pokemon.

Pokemon is no longer just for kids, Pokemon can still be fun for kids, but Pokemon can be fun for some older people too.

I loved Pokemon since when I was little kid, and I still Pokemon.
I got the DVD of this Pokemon movie for a birthday present when I was a teenager, and I still have the DVD of Pokemon the First Movie.

I recommend this movie to folks that love Pokemon.

Here are some reasons why I love this movie:
- This movie is based on this cartoon series Pokemon.
(This movie was made after they aired the original series of Pokemon)
- Ash's voice sounded great in this in Pokemon the First Movie as in the original series of Pokemon
- Misty was still traveling with Ash, when this Pokemon movie was made.

I would also recommend this Pokemon movie to some folks that say Misty is good-looking.
Remember Misty has a crush on Ash.
I miss seeing Misty in Pokemon.
Ash and Misty had great adventures together. Ash and Misty are a great couple.

If you love Pokemon, buy this Pokemon movie on DVD.
If you love Pokemon and If you don't have a copy of this movie, buy it if you want it!!!

116763,4,0790748266,"This DVD includes Pokemon The First Movie, as well as the short ""Pikachu's Vacation.""

""Pikachu's Vacation"" tells the story of Ash, Misty, and Brock's Pokemon going to a vacation spot specifically for Pokemon.  Over the duration of the 20-minute short, they have a run-in with border-ruffian Pokemon, and hilarity ensues.

The film itself tells the story of Mewtwo, a Pokemon created from DNA of Mew (a Legendary Pokemon).  After feeling betrayed by humans, Mewtwo creates a group of cloned Pokemon, which Mewtwo intends to use to eradicate humans and their Pokemon.  He then would repopulate the world with his clone Pokemon.  It's up to Ash and friends to save the day.

The DVD contains a few bonus features.  First, there's one labeled ""Behind-the-Scenes,"" which is just twelve pages of text that explain the origins of Pokemon in Japan and the United States, as well as explains the concept behind Pokemon.

There is also a version of the film on the DVD that contains commentary form Michael Haigney (the director) and Norman J. Grossfield (the producer).

The music video for M2M's ""Don't Say You Love Me"" is also a bonus feature (this was promoted as a single from the soundtrack for Pokemon The First Movie).  You can also see the theatrical trailer for Pokemon The First Movie, as well as a preview of Pokemon The Movie 2000.

The first Pokemon movie is one I had seen in theatres when it had first come out.  I think that this movie has a lot going for it and definitely ranks among the best of the movies.  I am not a big fan of Pikachu shorts.  Something I am glad that is not on every movie.  As far as Mewtwo Strikes Back is concerned, it is the only movie that is officially canon for the Pokemon series being that Mewtwo is seen in his metal armor several times during the series, most notably while battling Gary.  I liked the movie overall, I think it had an interesting story.  It kind of defeats the whole 'Gotta Catch 'em all' tagline because they make it seem as though there is only one Mewtwo.

That's pretty much what it boils down to: if you're someone who is not familiar or fond of the world of Pokemon, this movie will bore you to tears... but if you like the show, the movie pushes it to the next level. The movie opens with a 20 minute short featuring the pokemon without their human trainers. Once the short ends you get the story of Mewtwo versus Mew, which is pretty cool and features a lot of nice visuals. With a soundtrack featuring the pop-stars of the time, this movie also feels a bit more ""Americanized"" than most other Poke-features. While Lucario and the Mystery of Mew or Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea might have arguably better stories, this movie seems to zip along the quickest when you watch it.",1197158400,,886,4.509316770186335

116776,3,0790748266,"Pokemon: The First Movie (Kunihiko Yuyama, 1999)

I'm not sure why it took me eight years to get round to finally seeing Mewtwo Strikes Back (the proper name of this movie) in its entirety. I've seen snatches of it over the years, but never actually sat down to watch the full movie until now. Odd. I remember when it came out that at least one critic called it the worst movie of the year and said it was nothing more than an extended commercial for the game. I always found that rather amusing, given that many animated movies are commercials for something or other. The critics loved Brother Bear, didn't they? (Well, except me.) It's an extended PETA commercial.

That said, there are a lot of reasons not to like this movie, though it seems the main reason (the long, completely unsubtle ""fighting is evil"" sequence towards the end) exists only in its American version. It's annoying, but not really much more so than any of the godawful ""the moral of the story is..."" bits in Pokemon TV episodes.

Which is my chief complaint (though I can't really call it a reason not to like the movie) about Mewtwo Strikes Back; it's an extended episode of the show. Thus, if you like the show, you'll probably like the movie, and if you don't, you probably won't. This, however, begs the question: if you don't like the Pokemon TV show, why are you watching the movie? Just curious.

It could have been better, but it certainly could have been worse. It's not even in the bottom five of the movies I watched this weekend. ** ",1189987200,2,1519,4.529197080291971

Pokemon is  first of all a show that follows Ash Ketchum aboy who begins an adventure to catch and train pokemon-creatures that inhabit his world. It is pretty much a childrens show but the movie really has a strong theme.

It begins with a scientist funded by Giovonni, a corupt mad man in charge of a lethal organization. Now the scientists recovered a fossil that is said to be remains of the legendary pokemon Mew, also the first one in existence.

The cloning process was successful but Mewtwo soon discovered that the humans care nothign for him and rebelled against his creators. Once Giovonni betrayed him Mewtwo was adamant to destroy humanity thining humans are all the same. Doing that he brings forth the greatest trainers on the planet and clones their pokemon.

The movie teaches the greatest lesson that can be learned- We are all different but if you can look past the differences and focus on what we have in common then perhaps we can be so much more.

A good lesson hidden inside the chaoticly famous series.",1146441600,11,1162,4.483412322274882
116795,5,0790748266,"Before you turn down this movie due to the negative reviews of other people, please read my review.

  This is a much more powerful and deep tale than, ""evil Pokemon wants to rule the world"". Dr, Fuji was a scientist who wanted to bring back his dead daughter, Ai. He decided to do this, by cloning her. He decided to clone a Pokemon, and discover their life force, since the human clone could only live for four years. Thus, Mewtwo, a clone of the most rare and most powerful Pokemon ever, Mew, was born.

  Even though they were in separate glass cylinders (that kept them alive) mew and Ai could communicate telepathically. Mewtwo began to learn about the world around him. But, as it happened, it had been four years, and Ai died. Her father, Dr. Fuji, was not worried. He had her DNA, and he could clone her again. This made Mewtwo angry. How dare he just replace her?! She was a living being! Not a toy you can just replace again and again! Mewtwo became unstable, and they had to tranquilize him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

(Japanese Version)

Myuutsuu: Make them? As many as you want? That's not right. There's only one Ai.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

A year or so later, Mewtwo awoke. He learned that he was not born a Pokemon, but created. Created? He wondered. He was told that he was a clone. An experiment. A mere scientific product. He became angry. He was angry with the scientists who created him. They created him to be only an experiment, and nothing else. How could they? Furious at his own existence, he destroyed the lab, and everyone inside. Soon, Giovanni, the leader of the evil Team Rocket, and the man who ordered the scientists to create Mewtwo discovered him. Giovanni offered a deal. That he would train Mewtwo, and they would rule the earth together. Mewtwo ignore him. He did not need help. But the cruel Giovanni insisted that Mewtwo had no control over his powers, and he could help Mewtwo harness them. Mewtwo agreed to this.

  Giovanni created Mewtwo a battle suit, and had him fight. But soon, Mewtwo discovered that Giovanni didn't care about Mewtwo. Giovanni thought that Mewtwo was worth nothing. That he was created to fight for Giovanni, and for no other

reason.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mewtwo: Now I fully perceive my power. But what is my purpose?

Giovanni: To serve your master. You were created to fight for me. That is your purpose.

Mewtwo: That cannot be. You said we were partners. We stood as equals.

Giovanni: You were created by humans to obey humans. You could never be our equal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  This made Mewtwo angry. Giovanni believed that Mewtwo was an inferior being. How dare he? How dare he say that Mewtwo was only created to fight?! Furious, he left.

He went back to New Island, where the original lab had been, and created a new one. Humans, the horrible species that created him, that used him, and betrayed him. They cared nothing for clones, and he would make them pay. He would challenge the strongest trainers to come and fight, and then he would clone their Pokemon. He would have them fight, the Originals and the Clones, and see who had more worth. It was a war to see who would control the earth, clones, or originals. He would get his revenge.

  And so, he formed his plan. He created a giant storm, so only the strongest would make it through. The trainers came, and the battle of the century began. Mew, the original came to New Island. Mew was a protector Pokemon, and watched over all of the Pokemon. She would not let Mewtwo destroy the planet! And so, Mewtwo cloned the trainer's Pokemon, and had them fight.

  The originals and clones fought viciously, their trainers watching horrified. Mew and Mewtwo also faced off. Ash Ketchum, a Pokemon trainer watched his Pokemon fight. He realized that it had to stop. As Mew and Mewtwo formed energy balls, and ran into the middle of the crossfire, turning him to stone.

  It was at that moment the Pokemon realized what would happen as a result of this senseless fighting. And the Pokemon, clone and original cried. Mewtwo was shocked. These Pokemon crying for a human? The species that had abused and betrayed him?

The Pokemon tears were filled with life, and Ash was restored. Then Mewtwo realized something. That senseless war was not the answer, and that originals and clones could live together, in harmony. That everyone deserved equality. Mewtwo ceased the fighting, and took his clones to a place where they could live in peace. He wiped the memories of everyone except his clones and Mew, and everything was restored to normal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mewtwo: I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.

  This movie is very powerful, and holds a meaningful message. Please, watch this movie and experience Pokemon at its greatest. Thank you.",1145404800,61,5171,5.0650118203309695

116798,1,0790748266,"The crass commercialism of Pokemon is hardly the issue here. We've lived through He-Man, Thundercats, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, with no real scar left on children's entertainment. Pokemon enslaved children in the late nineties because it was a genuinely unique and novel idea. The video game was addictive, the character designs were interesting and the marketing gimmicks of seeing NEW characters were enticing... So what's the problem with Pokemon?

Look at the industry when the previous fads hit the airwaves. Children's entertainment was all about milking toys and movies so much that each fad could survive only until the next hit movie or new toy was released. Pokemon wasn't like these previous crazes made to sell a bunch of toys until interest moves onto the next big thing. Pokemon was an institution. They created an entire world of escapism that ended up to be so powerful, not even the release of a film was able to effect its popularity. If you completed the video game, they hooked you onto the card game, and when interest on the card game waned, they released a sequel to the video game, which lead to a new set of cards... They had us working on a loop that would make George Lucas drool.

By the time the older fans grew up and caught on, it was too late. The whole industry had taken Pokemon's lead and Japan/Anime-style saturated the market. Digimon, Card Captors, Loonatics Unleashed, Winx Club, and Yu-Gi-Oh are all the obnoxious off-spring to Pokemon that have ruined the fun associated with a craze and have left the soulless commercialism. As I said, Pokemon was a cool idea that just happened to inadvertently cause one of the biggest slumps in children's entertainment that'll take years to get out of.

As for the film... It's just bad.",1128124800,4,1823,4.874193548387097

116800,5,0790748266,"Mewtwo Strikes Back is, in my opinion, one of the best movies in existence, and not just because it has Pokemon in it.  The plot, dialogue and especially the art were all very interesting.  This movie has received a lot of hostility from people, but it's usually for the following reasons:

1. They dislike Pokemon, anime, or something along those lines.
2. They take cartoon violence way too seriously.
3. They just don't like the English version, because it is apparently evil and horrible and wrong for the English-speaking scriptwriters to write what they WANT, instead of conforming to the original script.

The movie is in fact, like I said, really, really, really, really good.  The plot involves a team of scientists making a clone of Mew, the rarest and most powerful Pokemon to have ever existed, after finding its eyelash (I think) in the Amazon.  However, they attempt to make the clone much more powerful than its genetic ancestor.  After developing in a gargantuan test tube for quite some time, Mewtwo is born.
Unlike most Pokemon, Mewtwo can actually speak human speech instead of just saying its name (this is most likely because the movie would be rather confusing otherwise).  Mewtwo quickly realises he is being used by the scientists, and so he blows up the lab.  It is at this point that the dastardly boss of Team Rocket, Giovanni, shows up and wheedles Mewtwo into a partnership with him.
However, after some time, Giovanni informs Mewtwo he isn't actually his equal and was created solely to obey humans.  Mewtwo is of course upset about this, so he blows up Giovanni's hideout and goes on his own.

Sometime later, Ash, Misty, and Brock are lured into a trap, along with some other trainers, via an invitation to battle ""the world's greatest Pokemon master"".  Mew, somehow sensing that it is needed, also goes to Mewtwo's hideout.
Mewtwo ends up cloning their Pokemon, rather like the scientists who created him, and a great battle ensues between the normal Pokemon and the super-clones, not to mention between Mewtwo and Mew.

In short, this movie is in fact really good, despite the bad reviews it tends to get.  I'm not sure I'd recommend it for especially young or sensitive children, though, because there are certain amounts of violence in it, but no one dies or anything.
Well, actually, Ash gets turned to stone, but he comes back to life after a few minutes, being the main character and all, and it's supposed to tie in with something someone said earlier on in the movie.",1124323200,6,2508,4.788863109048724

Although the main characters don't really evolve in character (what to you expect from a movie based on an anime that's been running for almost 10 years) the characters show their emotions more than they do in the T.V. show. If there is one thing positive about this trash of a dub it's that the new music isn't all that bad. However there was nothing wrong with the original music. It sounded just as good, it wasn't so overdramatic, and there also wasn't a million pop songs that had nothing to do with the movie playing in the backround. There's also another important difference between the English and Japanese cut. The most recent Japanese cut that was released before this version was about 12 minutes longer. Some of it can be seen on the American videos. One of the scenes cut plays after Pikachu's Vacation and another can be found in the Extras section of Mewtwo Returns.

116821,1,0790748266,"Pokemon is first and foremost an anime. But it's different from the typical anime licensed in America. It is mainstreamed, so that little kids will enjoy it and not get turned off by the Japaneseness that older people like.
Most of the time, an anime is released on video or DVD, and so the translators and writers keep in everything from mature themes to the original stories and characters. Then, if it is decided that the anime will be shown on TV, they will censor it and air it.
Pokemon is different, they don't dub the original thing, they dub a censored and dumbed down version and air that. What you see on TV and in the theater is the American Producers spin to the original thing.
You're not watching Pokemon, you're watching an Americanized version of Pokemon. What's more, the Americanized version is the version that all English-Language countries see, which upsets the poeple not living in America. (i.e. the Minnesota Vikings joke).
The Americanization of Pokemon is at an all time high in this movie, the story and dialogue is way off from the original. They even composed an entirely different score. (The new score isn't necissarily bad, but it's the thought that they are taking someone else's work and determining themselves how and that they must change it so that the narrow-minded American children will be able to enjoy it).
And so, the movie is terrible.
My biggest gripe is the inclusion of evil pop music. Pop music is evil, and no one really seems to know that. If the American version had alternative rock in it, I'd be happier, but that's just my personal opinion.
As I mentioned before, the dialogue is dumbed down seriously so that the movie is easier to understand. Exposition in this movie is multiplied by five from the original Japanese version. Another odd thing about the dialogue is that in the original Japanese version, the guy dressed as a pirate that Ash battles in the opening credits speaks English. But the American version dubbed over him anyway. Why? Why do they waste their time? Because they still changed the dialogue. Even in the movie theaters, they still feel that Pokemon must be censored. While in the Japanese version, the character said ""Oh my God!"" in the American version, he says ""Oh no!""
The worst translation change is this: in one scene, Mewtwo says ""What's happened here,"" in the Japanese version. In the English version, he says, ""Behold. With pokemon and humans eliminated, the clones shall inherit the world."" Why?
Back to the music, while the original score in the dub version is no better than the Japanese version, it's not very bad either. But they decided to add in some vocal tracks to increase their money with deals with record companies. But come on! There is a horrible horrible song called ""Brother, My Brother"" played during a FIGHT SCENE! Sure, the pokemon were fighting clones of each other, but the Japanese version had real symphonic music playing. Battle music. Duel of the Fates sort of thing. But 4Kids decided that they had to endear the parents with some sort of allegorical song so that they'd think their kids would learn something from it.
You know, that's all well and sweet and everything, but that sort of thing is for soliloquys at the end of the film, not fight scenes. Movies need to have a kind of artistic value, even ones for young kids. The addition of that song took away the emotion and power of the original scene and replaced it with an advertisement for the singer and a disclaimer to parents.
And don't get me started on the pointless M2M song ""Don't Say You Love Me."" No little kid would understand or like that song, and no self-respecting anime watcher would enjoy any pop song at all. It's a song for pubescent girls. Why?
That's it really. My only real problem is that the movie is too different from the better Japanese version. They are just too determined to mainstream it. While that's all I can really say about the movie, the bottom line is that it's just plain boring. I'm sure that little kids will love the battles and such, but for older people, it's like sitting there doing nothing.
They changed the Pikachu's Vacation movie too. How? You ask. There isn't any dialogue to change. Well, they changed the narrator from a sweet-sounding woman to the Pokedex, and they messed the music up like in the main film.",1059177600,7,4332,4.701315789473684

116833,3,0790748266,"When I first borrowed the video from my friend when I was 9, I thought it was awesome. I guess this was because I was trying to get into the trend and...well, I was 9; I hadn't developed a true taste for movies yet.
And now I am 13, and my view of the movie has changed. I don't think this movie is terrible, but it is not nearly as good as other movies out there.
First let's start the review by reviewing the 20-minute short: ""Pikachu's Vacation""
This short is a lot like the ""Pokemon"" TV-series in many ways. It's bright, cheery and has a ""Bugs Bunny""-esque kind of humor. The difference is it has no violence and keeps the humor running until the last 5 minutes, where they just have put in a moral.
If you're a fan of the TV-series, you'll probably like it. Me? I'll usually just skip the thing and go directly to the movie.
Now for the reason whether or not you want to buy this: ""Pokemon: The First Movie""
Undeniably much better than its short-film predecessor, the story focuses on the most powerful Pokemon ever: Mewtwo (with pretty good dub by Philip Barlett). Mewtwo is a genetically enhanced clone of an extinct Pokemon, Mew. After finally waking up from his tube inside the cloning facility where he was created, he speaks to his creators and believes that they care nothing for him and designed him only for experiments. Mewtwo, who only wants to find out his pupose for being, will not accept it as his destiny, and turns the laboratory into a raging inferno. Shortly afterward, he begins a friendship with the boss of the bumbling Team Rocket, Giovonni (Ted Lewis), but that friendship is quickly put an end when Giovonni presents Mewtwo with yet another destiny that he does not want to accept, and also sets flames to his glorious palace. After this, he believes that all humans are evil and starts a campaign of human extermination.
Sometime later (though it's not clear how long), Ash Ketchum (Veronica Taylor) and his buddies Misty (Rachael Lillis) and Brock (Eric Stuart) and his favorite (and everybody else's) favorite Pokemon Pikachu (Ikue Ootani) recieve an invitation to battle at the palace of ""The World's Greatest Pokemon Master"". Their form of transportation to the New Island (the place where the guy lives) would be a ferry. However, a storm has come and the ferry has been cancelled. Three other trainers take off into the storm on their Pokemon, but Ash, Misty and Brock's Pokemon are not strong enough. They get to the island with the help of Team Rocket members Jessie (Lillis), James (Stuart) and their cat Pokemon Meowth (Addie Blaustine) who are disguised as vikings (they're trying to steal Ash's poor little Pikachu). Once there, they meet the guy who's caused them all this trouble. And you know who he is, so I won't spoil any more for you.
Things I thought were wrong with this movie: Besides ""Pikachu's Vacation"", the animation was not very good. Effects were dull, colors and backgrounds seemed rushed and things move very jankily. Also, I felt there were some parts in which I think the violence got a little too extreme for a G-rated movie, so I would've given it a PG rating. But I'm probably the only one who thinks this. My brother would rather give it a PG-13 rating
Good Things: I thought that the story was really good. It was well plotted and had some nice suprises. The dubbing was pretty decent, though I'm never really sure what to think about Veronica Taylor's dubbing. I never have been.
All in All: This definetly isn't the best of the Pokemon movies, but it is decent, as the Pokemon franchise has proven itself to be. I never was a rabid Pokemon fan as so many were when the franchise first came out, but I still enjoy Pokemon to this day.
So if you want to buy, I would suggest a rent first if you haven't already seen this movie.",1055116800,,3795,4.574155653450807
116834,4,0790748266,"In the first theatrical release of the Pokemon series, we are given secondary stories to follow - stories that might lead to interesting classroom discussions.  This is not only a movie children will enjoy, but a movie that adults will find has story elements worth following up on.
If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.
In the main story, Giovanni, the leader of the evil ""Team Rocket"", uses cells from a prehistoric Pokemon named Mew to create a whole new creature.  But MewTwo is not a true clone - he is manufactured to be better than his 'parent'.  Giovanni wants to control MewTwo for himself, but MewTwo revolts against this, breaks free from his creator and begins a campaign of revenge.  It's up to Ash and his friends to stop MewTwo before he kills everyone on Earth with his scientifically enhanced psychic powers.  MewTwo begins his reign of terror by cloning other Pokemon to be better than their predecessors.
It is MewTwo's revolt and its results that can start interesting classroom discussions.  Questions for discussion include:  ""Is Cloning Wrong?""  ""If we do clone, do we want to try to alter the original?""  And, the most interesting dilemmas of all  - ""Is this all I am?""  ""Why am I here?""  ""Where do I go from here?""  These are dilemmas everyone must deal with.
I won't spoil the ending - it has to be seen.  Even the original Mew shows up to add to the fun.  The ending caused hours of talk between my daughter and myself.  I gained a whole new respect for Pokemon thru this movie, and I'm sure you will too.  The story's twin messages - one about cloning and its effects and one about ""Is This All I Am?"" are not preachy and the art is Japanamation at close to its best.
There's also a short Pikachu cartoon that younger Pokemon fans will enjoy.  Fans of the TV show will love this extra.
The story makes this movie well worth adding to your home video library.",1052870400,11,2463,4.562642369020502
116835,3,0790748266,"Out of all the Pokemon movies released in America, this is the one that bugs me a little. 4Kids Entertainment have watered down Mewtwo's personality, and the irony of it all is that out of ALL the Pokemon anime characters, Mewtwo is the most human, even though he's a Pokemon. That is, in the Japanese version. The first [thing] that 4Kids did to Mewtwo Strikes Back was changing the beautiful and haunting orchestral score that was in the Japanese version. Instead, they added in their own little MIDI track, which isn't SO bad compared to their later work on future projects, but that's not saying much.
The next thing they did wrong was altering Mewtwo's personality somewhat. Instead of the soul-searching, philosophical Mewtwo that pondered it's existence in the Japanese version, we now get a ""I am the most powerful Pokemon ever! Fear me and my great power!"" Mewtwo in the English version. Plus, the English voice actor that does Mewtwo's voice doesn't sound quite as threatening or frightening as he did in the japanese version, but at least he did OKAY.
 The only thing 4Kids did right was paying the japanese Pokemon animation studio, Shogakukan, to re-animate a few scenes to make them look better.
 Anyway, on this DVD we get a bit of extras, including the never before seen 'World of Pokemon' segment which introduces people to, what else? Pokemon.
We also get to see the short film, Pikachu's Vacation, which is VERY silly and Loony Tunes-esque(Heck, 4Kids redid the music to make it sound JUST like a Bugs Bunny cartoon!). 4Kids made some changes, but they weren't as major as the ones they did to the main film.
There's also a 'Origin of Mewtwo' segment which is quite lacking, considering that we only get to see LESS THAN A HALF of the whole thing! (Luckily they released the 'uncut' version on the Mewtwo Returns DVD)
There's some other stuff on this DVD too, like a directors commentary that isn't very informative, a music video of M2M(which, along with the song that's in the movie, has nothing REMOTELY close in common with this movie), and a trailer for the 2nd Pokemon movie.
But one question left is: Why didn't they put the japanese version on here? Hmm...
If you aren't a Pokemon fan, this movie probably won't change your mind about the franchise, but then again... IF they would put the original version on here for once, maybe it would.",1052697600,4,2367,4.742718446601942

After a few tests of Mewtwo, the evil Giovanni (Team Rocket Leader) then planned to use Mewtwo's powers for the wrong reasons. Mewtwo then revolted, escaped and swore revenge against any all who stood against him. It's up to Brock, Misty, Ash and Pikachu to stop Mewtwo before he destroys everything.
This is a great kids movie. It has a nice soundtrack that the kids will love, the animation is good and it has most of the favorite Pokemon like Pikachu, Charizard, Gyarados and many more plus the addition of Mewtwo and Mew. Anyone into the series will like this one.
Now of course, you have to be into the series somewhat to understand parts of it but still, Pokemon is a little more basic than say Cardcaptors, Digimon, etc so even if you're not up to speed with Pokemon, you'll get it pretty quickly.

As in the TV shows, a Pokemon trainer, Ash and his other friends, also Pokemon trianers, are heading off to the big Pokemon tournament to be the greatest Pokemon master. Meanwhile, a mean, mutated Pokemon is cloned out of the angelic Mew, called Mewtwo, wants revenge and closes off the tournament by creating a bad storm.
But Ash and his friends manage to get to the tournament, and Mewtwo decides to clone all the Pokemon and send them fighting against each other and rule the world. Ash, in order to save the Pokemon and his world, has to fight Mewtwo.
The movie is a promising, though short at 1 hour and 9 minutes, cutesy anime flick. The animation is bright and colorful, a fine vocal cast and comic humor is aplenty. But, in spite of the promising things, P:MSB has a flimsy plot and the moral sticking out is that fighting is the right way to settle issues?
I give it a full ***** stars, but I subtract 1 for the flimsy plot and another for the the fighting moral. If the writers for the U.S. release had though better, they might have rewritten a moral in there that is better than the... one that is implied in this otherwise delightful animated movie.",1011571200,,1360,4.487903225806452

Then came a horrible TV show starring an annoying, whiny-voiced kid (Ash) and a little yellow electric rat(pikachu). My brother owns this movie. I have seen it a few times. I was not impressed, but then again, I wasn't too happy with the... TV show on which it is based. The message in the movie-it's what's inside that matters-has been overused in other children's movies. Fans of the TV show (like my brother) will enjoy it, but the movie(and the show) are too inconsistent with the Game Boy games. Hearing the annoying voice of Ash and watching him make stupid decisions detracts even more from the movie. The worst part is, there's not one but TWO sequels.

A story about true equality in a world in which humans and animals are symbiotic with one another.  Mewtwo is one of the best tragic villians ever put on screen.  He is the Malcolm X of pokemon.  Malcolm was extreme in his nature because the place and time demanded that he was.  It's the same in this film for Mewtwo.  Any self respecting human being would react in the same manner.  The film takes kids, its target audience, through every emotional gamit possible.  It also gives kids questions to ponder, serious life changing questions.  In something so blatantly commercial as pokemon is, the filmmakers choose to point a very strong message admist all the advertisments.  A very nice change of pace.

The movie was made for the children not for the teenagers like in Japan. So if you are 10 and up you may not like this movie even is you say you ""love pokemon"". In the US the show is edited a little becasue it is for young children just the movie is editied and chaged up. If you are looking for a ton of battles you won't get it in this movie. There is one big battle scene but non of the pokemon use their powers, but the just tackle or hit each other. If you are going to buy the movie let me just say you should have seen it in the theatre where it was a lot more fun to watch. If you like watch the show for the characters and the story line then you will like this movie. If you only watch the show because there is fighting between pokemon or because you sort of like it you won't like the movie.

The movie seemed to be going on and on but not actually going any where. And at the end it to them so long to prove the very basic moral of the story. I have to admit i was abit surprised by the begining when mewtwo escapes that was the only part in the movie where something almost unpredictable hapended. Despite this movie earning 80 million amang the highest for cartoons the movie was HORRIBLE. Many pokemon fans where disapointed with the outcome of this movie. Just a cheap way for billion dollar companies to squeeze all the money they can out of hardworking people. The bottom line is don't even rent this movie.,976838400,2,772,4.521428571428571

This movie contains over 300 laughs, nice graphics, etc.  Because I had too many R-rated movies that suck so hard that I'll never watch them ever again.  I love the part when Mewtwo is throwing too many evil poke balls at his opponents.  When he does, he simply tries his luck at making clones for himself.  Did he?  No.  Not only is this movie the dark ruler of all, but it's the easiest movie to follow.  But whatever you do, stay away from South Park.  It's not worth it.

116863,2,0790748266,"Pokemon. A word that strikes fear into the hearts of adults and sends children scurrying for their pocket money. The incredible marketing phenomenon, which has spawned games, trading cards and an animated international TV series, now makes it's way to the local cineplex with the first in a projected series of feature film outings.
For those of you who have been living on a desert island for the last couple of years, Pokemon are 150 critters of different shapes and abilities, which are captured and held by human trainers, who unleash them to do battle witheach other. The main character in the animated series is Ash Ketchum, a brash young trainer, whose pet, Pikachu - a cute, mouse-like animal that shoots electricity - has become the unoffical mascot of the Pokemon universe.
In Pokemon: The First Movie, Ash, Pikachu and their friends are lured to New Island tocompete in the greatest competition in the world. Their host is Mewtwo, a sort of mouthless flying kitten. Angry over his creation, Mewtwo plans to wipe out all humans and Pokemons off the face of this Earth, using clones of the visting Pokemon. The result is a series of protracted battles between clones and original, before Ash and his crew finally save the day.
Whether the movie actually suceeds or not is difficult to say. There's lots of silly moralizing about things like responsibility and team-work, but, at the end of the day, the kids are there for the pointless, noisy fight scenes. All parents and adults should resign themselves to bringing along a good book or simply sitting in the car until the film is over.",973382400,,1596,4.828467153284672

116866,4,0790748266,"All in all, I was quite pleased with this film. Pok&eacute;mon's first showing on the big screen seems to have passed the quality checks of most US and UK  fans, and its success in other countries has undoubtedly been similar.  However, I was quite disappointed by the English dub (by now a very common  point of criticism). The dialog, compared with the original Japanese,  has  been butchered, which I find very annoying. A prime example of this is  actually from the second Pok&eacute;mon movie, Pok&eacute;mon The Movie 2000, where, in  the Japanese version, a character says ""this is serious..."" and  in the English dub says ""I wish I had some pants...""!
The  ""Americanisation"" of anime is something that has irritated true  fans of Pok&eacute;mon, and although the producers and writers at Kids WB and  4Kids seem to think it necessary, I can assure you, it isn't! What the fans  would like to see is the original anime, without the retouching done by US  corporations. Thankfully, we still get to see the original anime, due to  the efforts of The Pikachu Projectand Fans 4 Fans, and because of the fact  that neither Kids WB, 4 Kids or Nintendo of America hold the Japanese  copyrights on Pok&eacute;mon...
One thing in the movie's favour is that the  animation has been greatly enhanced, so that the 3D rendering of objects  such as the double doors leading into Mewtwo's castle and The Flight of  Dragonite at the beginning of the movie.
So, overall: this film has  whetted my appetite with regards to Pok&eacute;mon-based movies, but in the  future, more adherance to the original script would be appreciated.",965952000,2,1620,4.882352941176471
116867,3,0790748266,"Having 2 children at the ages of 2 and 4 1/2, I've grown to love Pokemon. Being a fan of Pokemon, I tought that Pokemon the First Movie was pretty  boring. I've seen it dozens of times, and each time I see it, I always  think how boring it is. It seems dark and isn't as humorous as the TV  series. It also lacks excitement, fun and the story line wasn't that great.  It will keep a childs attention throughout the whole movie though! Mewtwo  is a genetically designed Pokemon that is suppose to be the most powerful  of all. Mewtwo decides that he wants to conquer the world. So he  manipulates Pokemon Masters onto going to the island, where he can clone  their Pokemons. Then he battles them. Then your fearless heroes come to  save the day, Ash, Brock and Misty. The movie had it's usual supporting  cast; such as the villains Jesse, James and Meowth. The one thing that the  movie didn't have was a variety of Pokemon! It had the usual, like Pikachu,  Charizard, Bulbasaur, but where were some of my favorites like Hitmon Chan,  Diglet and others? I don't even remember seeing Wheezing of Arbok in it! I  even expected to see Ash's rival, Gary Oak, in the movie, but he only had a  very small cameo in it.
The movie also included the short film,  ""Pikachu's Vacation"". This 20 minute cartoon was far better then  the actual movie itself. It is the main reason why I rated this movie 3  stars instead of 1. I thought it was great! It was funny, exciting and the  music accompanied the different scenes. It introduced new Pokemon, and had  a variety of the old ones. The features on the DVD wasn't that bad also. It  had little shorts like ""Ash's Journey"".

116883,3,0790748266,"I wasn`t sure what to expect when I saw this. This feature is actually made up of two movies - the short ""Pikachu`s Vacation"" and the slightly longer ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"". In ""Pikachu`s  Vacation"" Ash and the gang take their Pokemon for a holiday on an  island. Its cute but strange, made up almost entirely of the Pokemon  speaking their own special language.
The premier feature ""Mewtwo Strikes  Back"" is very different. I thought this was far darker and more emotional  than usual, and it freaked some people out who were expecting a kids`  cartoon. The story is that Mewtwo - a new breed of Pokemon (created from  the DNA of an extremely rare Pokemon called Mew), and designed by a group  of scientists to be the most powerful fighter the world has ever seen,  breaks away from his human masters and opts for world domination, creating  a race of genetically engineered Super Pokemon. Needless to say - Ash and  the others come to try to beat Mewtwo and save the world.
While this  wasn`t the worst movie I`ve ever seen, it could have been better. The  American dubbing is crude and Mewtwo`s character is awful. In the original  Japanese version, Mewtwo acted the way he did because he was lost and  confused - in America his character is a simple villain who is evil just  for the sake of being evil. The soundtrack also stinks - the excellent  music of the TV show is replaced with god-awful chart pop which has nothing  to do with the movie.
Overall this movie was not bad, but not great. I  hope the English writers do a better job with Pokemon The Movie 2000.",963360000,4,1569,4.519572953736655

Unfortunately, some things should  just stay as a cartoon series. The animation style of the series is so  wretched that it couldn't possibly look good in a full blown movie.  Pikachu's Vacation is cute, but it's incomprehensible and horridly strange.  The main movie itself is slow, boring, and inane. It also rudely  jackhammers its message into your poor brain. The soundtrack? Dumb. More  excuses to show off pop sensations. All in all, I really don't care if this  movie is entertaining to Pokemon fans. That's not enough for me or for  those who aren't.

For instance in the last battle scene when Misty mentions  about how meaningless the battle was, she was referring to the fight to the  death of the Pokemon.  Pokemon enjoying fighting, not killing.  That's the  difference between the fighting that they do with the trainers and the  fighting they were doing with their superpokemon clones.  Mewtwo was pretty  threatening in his own way, and his anger was portrayed very well by the  voice actor.  While some of the names weren't the best choices, I wasn't  really interested in the nicknames that they chose.  Ash's 'death' was  quite well done, and I thought that the music was excellent.

116919,4,0790748266,"Ok I bought this for my six and seven year old kids (who seem to know what all of these odd little creatures are called and what they do) and yes Ok I watch the Tv series now and again but nothing prepared me for this.
This  is really good! It is like the Tv series has really grown up and can now  compete with the likes of Mulan and The Lion King! A great message, some  very interesting (weird) characters and a nice little twist. Add to this  humour, danger and cute little Pikachu. What more could you want?
This is  the story of a human created advanced pokemon called Mewtwo and his quest  for purpose. It involves attracting all the best pokemon and their trainers  for a fight to the death. Typical man creates beast, beast supercedes man,  beast learns humanity stuff. But on the way you learn how powerful Mewtwo  really is, what his creators were really up to, the dangers of genetic  cloning and how really loving your pokemon helps them become the very best.  There is actually real emotion when the pokemon and their clones are  fighting eachother and Pikachu refuses to fight. I had to pass my son my  tissue (I had something in my eye of course).
The usual characters are  there (I cannot believe I can remember them), Ash, Missy, Brock, Squirtle,  Bulbasaur, Team Rocket and of course Pikachu along with the original Mew  (comes a close second on the cutes stakes).
Loads of extras include the  very funny Pikachu's vacation, pictures, a music video and some download  stuff and of course a look at the next Pokemon movie!
So, stop being  cynical go watch it with your kids and enjoy. And hey, I am sure that the  voice of Mewtwo is the same as that of Brain in Pinky and the Brain!",954806400,5,1700,4.405144694533762

116934,5,0790748266,"I bought the movie because I am a Pokemon addict. I love the show! The movie had a strong plot and was gave very good background on the origins of Mewtwo (remember that invincible Pokemon that beat Gary in Viridian City?).  The plot was powerful and engaging and it brought to near tears on several  occasions. The dialog is a bit sappy though, however thats the norm for  Pokemon :-)",954115200,2,384,4.457142857142857
116935,1,0790748266,"First off, let me say that the Japanese version of Mewtwo Strikes Back is, IMO, the best the pokemon world had to offer, and my personal favorite.  The American version, is well, really bad.
I have seen both versions, and  most notably, they change absolutely everything in the American version.  And I do mean absolutely everything.
The plot is not the same as in the  original Japanese version.  In the original, the basic plot is a confused  Mewtwo resenting the fact that he was created by humans, not God, and  thinks his life has no meaning.  Throughout the movie, Mewtwo tries to get  revenge on those who made him and tried to enslave him, and more  importantly, to prove his worth as a living being by beating his original,  Mew.
The American version simply has Mewtwo trying to take over the world  and destroying everything.
The original has an introduction that depicts  Mewtwo as somewhat of a confused child, not knowing who he is, what he is,  or why he is there, a theme that is emphasized throughout the movie.  He is  told that he was made by humans and is a clone, which upset him, to say the  least.  Mewtwo only teams up with Giovanni because the crime boss offers to  give some value to Mewtwo's life.
In the American version, It starts  off with a really bad speech about the meaning of life, then a short little  bit of the scientists explaining to Mewtwo that he was a experiment, Mewtwo  getting ticked, and blowing up the place.  Giovanni comes along, and they  agree to destroy stuff together.
I won't go into all that much detail  about the rest of the movie, but I will point out some major  changes.
First, the intro song is different, of course, and is in fact,  worse.
A lot of the dialogue is different, aside from the everyday  stuff, like Ash saying, ""I said I was too tired to work, not  battle!"" as opposed to ""Just one or two battles before  lunch!""  For example, every single line Team Rocket says is different.  I am not kidding.  The scene about Jessie holding up a frying pan is  originally about them having no food to cook, as opposed to Jessie's  horrible cooking.  Also, not once in the original did Team Rocket make a  bad pun.  In the American version, that was the only thing they did.
The  pier master in the original says that one can tell what the conditions are  in the ocean by asking the seagulls, while in the American version, she  speaks of a legend of magical tears that can revive living things.  (Gotta  explain the ending to us dumb Americans)
Also, the American version says  nothing about the fossilized eyelash of Mew that was created to form  Mewtwo.  Heck, the entire computer speech was different.  In the original,  it was a third, unnamed, person who spoke, not the scientist.
The speech  Mewtwo gives to the trainers when they first meet him is completely  different, as well.  In the original, Mewtwo says that humans are weak and  cruel, and the world will fall into ruin because they control it.  He also  says that Pokemon are no better off, since they choose to associate with  humans.  Not once did he say anything about taking over the world, but it  is vaguely suggested.  Also, it is Mewtwo who says that they should battle  pokemon to see who is the strongest, the clones verses the originals.
In  the American Version, Mewtwo basically says he'll destroy all humans and  take over the world.
This is a key change in the movie: In the original  when Mew appears, it says that originals will never be defeated by their  copies when they fight without special powers.  Thus, Mew is partially  responsible for the big battle that follows.  The battle itself is about  pokemon fighting for the meaning of their lives, since, (as Mewtwo sees it)  clones have no value, and whomever wins will be the 'real' one, not the  worthless clone.
In the American, Mew is free of all sin, and says that  pokemon's greatest strength is their heart, or some corny thing like that,  and the battle is basically the clones trying to destroy the originals for  no reason.
I'd also like to point out that the original had a pretty good  music score in this scene, while the American version had a really bad  teeny bopper song playing inappropriately in the background.
Also, the  original have the humans who are watching says a whole heck of a lot more  about how Mewtwo and all the clones are living beings with value, while in  the American, that was touched on briefly, followed by people crying out  how bad it is that everyone's fighting.
And as little other thing, when  the two Nayasus meet, in the original, the copy says that Nayasu is not  fair because he is not fighting with him, and also they talk about  philosophy and the moon, and how tasteful it is to be talking about the  moon at a time like this.  The American version simply has Meowth saying  that fighting is bad.
The ending is different by quite a bit too,  naturally.  In both the original and American version, it appears that the  humans forgive Mewtwo for what he has done.  This is *much* more implied in  the original as opposed to the American version.  Also, in the original,  Mewtwo states that it does not matter who is more powerful, that the clones  and originals both have value, and nothing else about the matter.  He also  says that it would be best if no one knew about what happened.  The  American version tacks on some stuff about how he realizes fighting is  wrong, and that he shouldn't have made things just  to destroy them, and  other forced moralisms.  When Mewtwo flies off in the end in the original,  he says that he will find a place where clones can live in peace, while the  American version goes on trying to shove morals in a movie that originally  did not have one.
I guess to put it bluntly, WB seriously dumbed down  the movie and simplified it.  In the original, Mewtwo is battling for  revenge, but more importantly to add meaning to his life.  That is why he  wants to prove he is the most powerful pokemon, so that he can prove to the  world, and most importantly to himself, that he is in fact a living being  with value, since he relates power with value.  Mewtwo is not evil in this  film, just confused, misguided, and really ticked off.
The American  version takes that element out, and portrays Mewtwo as an evil pokemon who  wants to destroy the world.  That is why I got sick when seeing the  American version.  (Did I mention that the voice acting in the American  version was really bad also?)",953856000,34,6479,4.517779705117086

116951,3,0790748266,"Wow!  If you don't know what Pokemon is, you've probably been stuck in a cave for the past year or so with your fingers in your ears.  Just kidding.  Well, we all have grown to love (or hate) Pokemon for our own reasons.  Anyway, down to the movie.
The movie itself was done pretty well.  It is  just like the cartoon you can watch on your television set, but with a  clearer picture quality and better soundtrack (it really is pretty good).  No story spoilers, but it is a pretty basic story.  Good vs. Evil.  The  Pikachu's Vacation short is really cute and will appeal to kids who don't  like violence all the way to kids who want to see action (there's  competitions).  As for the movie, I wouldn't recommend it for kids who  don't like the fighting aspect of Pokemon, but rather one particular  pokemon (such as Pikachu or Psyduck).  The story can get quite violent and  my godbrother and godsister (about age 12 and under) really did not enjoy  the violence in the film (violence = evil deeds from the evil side of the  team).
However, if you can bypass that whole violence part of Pokemon,  then it's a pretty good movie.  Though simple in story, it does a pretty  good job capturing the essence of the television show and video game.  You  get to see new pokemon from gold and silver AND... you get a free promo  card!  Well, I did anyway.  So if you've never seen this movie yet, worth a  rental.  If you're a poke-maniac, buy it asap.  If you don't like pokemon  whatsoever... then... er... don't even consider it.  It won't change your  opinion (however, the show and games might).",953596800,9,1592,4.451048951048951

I let my younger cousins watch the Japanese version, and  they have never seen the English version. (I had made sure to watch the  movie before hand incase it needed screening, which it didn't.)  I find it  disgusting the way editors hack apart a foreign film, taking out all  emotion, and anything worth watching.
The dubbing was horrid, the  Proffessor's voice was grating on the ears.  The soundtract for the English  version was so out of place.  Yes, the music is okay as a stand-alone, but  when combined with the movie, it just ruind the overall mood.
Many of the  Pok&eacute;mon names were confused and just plain messed up.  The new composed  music that replaced the nifty-spiffy creepy pipe organ music (Mewtwo's  theme) was so depressing that i wanted to throw up.
Yes, Shogakukan  digitized some sections for the US release, and that was rather neat, but  to hack apart a wonderful entertaining movie was just wrong.
The kids  will rave, but older Pok&eacute;mon fans like myself will find it frustrating and  rather dull.  If you want to see the English version, that's fine. (I'm  getting it just for the card, and to use as a  ""compare-and-contrast"" with my Japanese version.)
