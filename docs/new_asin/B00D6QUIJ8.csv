5775730,5,B00D6QUIJ8,This is worth a look about frequency and what it is doing the the world food and health and the animals especially the bees,1378598400,6,123,4.166666666666667
5775731,5,B00D6QUIJ8,This is a very well thought out documentary.  It will make you think twice about modern technology and it's impact on all walks of life from humans to animals.  Prior to watching this film I had not even considered electromagnetic sickness but at the same time there are probably many people in my family who are suffering ill effects from this now tangible disturbance in the worlds electromagnetic field.  I highly recommend watching this film as it will challenge previous perspectives about the world as you know it.,1378598400,7,520,4.886363636363637
5775732,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"A well done documentary that is not only worth watching, but critical to anyone living in our modern world.

I appreciated the inclusion of various scientists' opinions and observations.

We definitely do need more studies in this area.",1378512000,2,236,5.184210526315789
5775733,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"I highly recommend viewing this video, if you want a well-balanced, factual, truthful, and thoughtfully informative presentation of the picture of how EMFs are devastating our world.  All of our world is so intricately interwoven in a perfect, fragile balance, and we rarely give a thought to how something we take for granted, like using our cell phones, may be killing us all.  Even though the facts present a bleak picture, I still believe that if enough people watched this video and awakened to the crucial need to create a new reality, we could turn things around very quickly.",1377216000,5,583,4.878787878787879
5775734,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"The movie explained why we need to reconsider our massive use of wave technology.  This is presented in a scientific way that is backed by very logical and credible information.  Anyone with a high school or higher education should be able to understand the effects of our bombardment of waves.  While my wife has been Leary and suspicious of wave technology from the very start, I now believe her feelings were founded in real scientific evidence.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the physical world.",1374796800,5,530,4.855555555555555
5775735,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"Do not take this movie lightly, it will scare the pants off of you.

5775736,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"Excellent film that needs to be shown to as many people as possible. As a high tech professional for over 40 years, I became aware of the issue of electromagnetic radiation during the 80's. There was a great deal of talk among IT professionals of unwanted affects of EMF radiation in many of the early electronic devices as they were not shielded particularly well and emitted a great deal of said radiation.

However, it is not just computers, cell phones and WIFI related devices. Smart meters emit a constant stream of EMF radiation as do many other common household devices. Anything that uses or distributes electricity (household wiring) will emit EMF radiation if it is not properly shielded. There are steps that can be undertaken to protect yourself.

Resonance, Beings Of Frequency details just how much this radiation affects us on a daily and long term basis. Just because we cannot see it does not mean it is not affecting us at unseen levels. That is the gist of the movie, we are living in an electronic soup that is harming us greatly with short and long term affects.",1474675200,5,1084,4.73015873015873

5775740,1,B00D6QUIJ8,"I can almost see James Russell, the director of this garbage, cowering in his bunker wearing a tin foil hat. Seriously, this is just plain fabricated junk science. Quickly run and buy some LED lights (EMF shields) so you can sleep better at night. I know I sleep better knowing that I haven't blown a few hundred or a few thousand dollars on misrepresented LED lights and so called smart shields. This is just warped facts twisted into a slightly coherent montage of injudicious fears. I wouldn't be surprised if the producer of this was selling $5.00 lights as $250.00 ""resonators"". Within the first 15 minutes of this ""documentary"" I saw many skewed or just plain wrong facts.",1471392000,3,678,4.754237288135593
5775741,1,B00D6QUIJ8,"This movie just barely managed to convince me there could be a serious problem with mobile technology. This conclusion comes in spite of the terrible pseudoscience riddled throughout this presentation.

In respect to schumann resonance and going outside: ""How else could it make you feel so good?""

Are you f'n kidding me? There's so many reasons (sunlight for example) going outside makes you feel good. Even when the science presented seems to follow logically, there's almost no attempt at offering alternative explanations. So when it's combined with garbage like the above, how can one possibly trust this video as a reliable source? Answer: You can't.",1471132800,6,657,5.247619047619048
5775742,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"Xray student here, all of this is on point and true. Funny thing is, my mother who is in the same field has been saying all this since I was  a kid. Sad truth our technology is killing our world.",1471132800,3,195,3.875

5775757,1,B00D6QUIJ8,"I'm unconvinced and incredulous regarding the supposed disparate experts and tying loosely them across so many fields. It doesn't help that title cards like ""Around 70% of the worlds food crops are pollinated by bee's"" fail to undergo even a highschool level of editorial review to be corrected to ""Around 70% of the world's food crops are pollinated by bees"" indicating that it's unlikely any fact checking or higher level review occurred. Other title cards like ""How else could it make you feel so good?"" referring to the narration of more obvious proof [of an electromagnetic resonance's relation to human wellbeing] can be found by simply going outside. Well, you want to walk us through strawman arguments, okay, how about because sunshine helps your skin synthesize vitamin D which helps regulate mood. That's just one, there's probably a whole litany of possible other great things about going outdoors every so often, maybe fresh air. There's no mention of Schumann resonances being at variable multiple frequencies, or present mostly during lightning, as opposed to all the time. There's also an early appeal to science by talking about some pseudoscience water-memory experiment that highlights how this experimenter was the only person who ever ""created life where there was none."" First organized nucleotides are not DNA which is also not life all by itself. Second when an experiment only works for one experimenter that means the experiment is failed. It fails to sufficiently explain the supposed observed phenomena in an understandable way allowing its results to be used. I don't even want to go on anymore.",1418428800,12,1624,5.178707224334601
5775758,4,B00D6QUIJ8,"This is a case where science rightly understood has shown what I believe to be true. A friend of mine showed me the video. I was truly enlightened and when I got home had to have a copy of my own. It was very revealing the way one scientist stated that ""it all depends on WHO is sponsoring the study. In other words no one wants to loose their research money so they better come up with the right favorable answer or they are ruined. Great video, highly recommend it.",1402617600,,467,4.2

5775760,4,B00D6QUIJ8,"Prior to placing my order I had watched the documentary at least twice on one of the non-corporate-owned tv networks I watch on a regular and on-going basis.

5775761,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"This film was made in the UK and depicts, through animation in some places, the all-encompassing Radiation that all wireless devices emit, but which cannot be seen with the naked eye. The physical results show up later in one's body with the worst being cancerous tumors particularly from Cell Towers which are called Masts in the UK. There are interviews with some of the people who were affected by them. Unfortunately, the majority of people with wireless devices who presently feel nothing and, mistakenly assume this means they're not being injured, need to know ""Not Yet."" As Radiation penetrates every known bldg material, it doesn't stop when it reaches the occupants. Radiation is cumulative & without a cure. This is a Must See Film!",1396569600,7,743,5.0

5775763,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"In today's fast paced age of high technology gadgets, most people (myself included) do not read the directions of the device, let alone the warnings of possible health issues. With regards to this outstanding documentary, my wife and I have viewed this 4 times so far and see it as the most important information we can convey to others. Prior to this video, I had no clue I was somewhat affected by artificial magnetic fields and because of the knowledge I've gained about EMF through this video, combined with my job dealing with transmission level voltages up to 800kV, I have changed my home environments and personal habits.

For years I dealt with headaches almost daily, some more severe than others, chronic fatigue and a difficult time sleeping. Since watching this documentary, I have done 5 things to enhance my home environment and since doing so the headaches are few and far between, sleep is better and deeper.
1). Removed all CFL light bulbs.
2). Installed a smart utility meter attenuation cover to reduce its output power. It's way overpowered.
3). WIFI off at night.
4). All switching power supplies unplugged at night(IE laptop)
5). Installed Earthcalm device.",1395187200,20,1180,4.959595959595959

8590091,5,B00D6QUIJ8,"Very good production quality given that it's obviously made on a shoestring.

Googling along as I watched it making pretty fantastic claims about the origin and development of life within the Earth's natural electromagnetic field  that were pretty easy to dismiss, but  about 15 minutes in when they get to the (very well documented) role of the cryptochrome proteins in animal  magnetic navigation it's ON and gets quite alarming with some very sobering (and peer-reviewed) studies showing brains getting excited by cell phone radiation and Lennart Hardell's longitudinal study of mobile phone user's brain cancer incidence.

In spite of some distracting typo goof ups that should have been caught (""*moping* up the free radical cancer cells"" , really guys?) the information that they share is so compelling that I forgave them their faults and up-rated from three stars based on the wonky intro material to a full five stars because of the seriousness of the health risk data they're sharing.",1518393600,,994,5.1875
