2405300,1,B000B7QCG8,"Dear sweet lord I don't know what on this green Earth could have enticed WotC (Wizards of the Coast) to want to non the less make a sequel to one of the worst fantasy fix of all times. Oh that's right I said it. When the original came out people thought it was ok (if they smoked crack) simply because it had nothing else from the decade before it to compare to. Sure on the list of films like YOR: Hunter from the future, Krull and Kull the conqueror, it was a fine piece of.... cinema?  Real toast to impractical weapons and lame special effects, Cheers! So if you really like watching train wrecks (oh and believe me I do) then pick this thing up for your next Bad movie night. Just remember to use gloves.",1128384000,6,709,4.213235294117647
2405301,4,B000B7QCG8,"First I must start with I did enjoy watching the first one. Knowing Solomon's time and money constraints. Well done. Now onto the new movie. Of course the direction, sets and acting is much better. But I am sure so was the budget. The characters were well cast. It is a shame that Mr. Solomon did not participate in some way though.

I loved watching how when you watched this movie I could relate to some of the charcaters you have played. The magic is well done as are the monsters. If you will excuse the term, this movie is much more realistic then the first one.  You will watch as the standard five member party negotiate traps, fight monsters and use magic to get out of trouble.

You can preview the movie on the SciFi channel next week. And I plan to purchase the DvD as soon as it is released. So watch it, you will find it enjoyable.",1128038400,23,844,4.2625
2405302,4,B000B7QCG8,"I also saw the Screener today and thought it was far superior in everyway than the first, well apart from the special effects but they were still believeable.  This is how the first movie should have been, The script, the acting and the atmosphere, in fact everything about this film is better than the first. Great interaction between the Rogue and Barbarian. Damidar is actually believeable in this film, Great references to actually DnD and we get to see alot of magic not just the magic dust from the first movie. Very big improvement on the first and alot more serious (no more snails, GREAT) i definately reccommend it.  Rumours of a third movie already and all i can say is hope its like the 2nd not the 1st.",1127001600,6,715,4.534883720930233

2405362,4,B000B7QCG8,"I saw this movie first on TV (on the SciFi Channel).  There were many commercial interruptions, which spoiled the movie.

Being a fan of D&D, I bought the movie.  When I watched it without the interruptions, I thought ""Wow, this is a good movie"".  D&D fans will especially like it, because it references many favorite modules (like S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, C2: The Ghost Tower of Inverness), characters use D&D magic items, as well as being consistent within the context of a D&D world.

The movie had a complete D&D Adventuring Team:  a Cleric, a Mage, a Barbarian, a Thief, and a Fighter.  All were well acted and played by the actors and actresses.

I wish the movie had a bigger budget for special effects, then it would have been a truly amazing movie (which is the only reason why I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5).",1401148800,,839,4.509933774834437

2405396,5,B000B7QCG8,"For the film itself it was certainly a step up from the first film, though that isn't really a difficult feat to pull off. While the first film seems to have fallen into the ""So Bad, It's Good"" category thanks to its over-the-top acting and poor set pieces, this film has improved in its overall quality into ""So Okay, It's Average"". It is a better send off to fans of the original tabletop game as it contains many references to canon campaigns and shows that the film makers studied the source material seriously.

Now for the BluRay release.

I can only describe the quality as near-perfection. Every scene has a clarity in picture I've not seen before. It's possible to get a close up so pristine that you are capable of counting every hair in someone's stubble. The picture quality is also vastly superior to the BluRay release of the original film, which actually looks worse because of the picture clarity, allowing CGI imperfections to be more easily noticeable. The same goes for this film as the low-budget CGI effects are not well composed, jerky in animation, and not perfectly integrated into scenes. The sound quality is as good as it can be. The power of uncompressed audio allows for the more extravagant effects such as magic to ring clear through high quality speakers or headphones.

All the special features from the DVD also appear, but in their standard DVD quality. The audio commentary is rather enjoyable as instead of it being the usual Director/Producer/Cast commentary of every other film, it has three of the production team acting as three iconic D&D characters to deliver a commentary Mystery Science Theater 3000-style, citing unique character traits of various classes, D&D lore, and taking plenty of comical jabs at one another, adding an entertainingly enlightening experience.",1367193600,,1812,4.953947368421052

2405398,1,B000B7QCG8,"The costumes are cheap cosplay types, with fake leather, etc and its obvious they are using foam weapons and armors. Even the half orc and the lich have very minor roles in this movie. The ""bandits"" look much like fake townpeople with fake weapons added to them. Very choppy plot and very badly played villian. This is low even by Sci Fi channel movie standard and they had made plenty of crap horror films so far thus they should had been renamed Bad Horror Movie Channel.",1359936000,,473,4.511627906976744
2405399,4,B000B7QCG8,"RELEASD TO TV IN 2005 and directed by Gerry Lively, ""Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God"" amasses a good group of protagonists who seek to find some magical black orb and save their kingdom, Ismir, from the wrath of a malevolent dragon slumbering in a nearby mountain. This involves an evil wizard, Damodar, played by Bruce Payne, who is the only one to return from the first D&D film from 2000.

I liked the whole adventure-quest aspect of the story and the colorful group of characters who join together to defeat the wizard and save the kingdom: A noble ex-knight statesman (Mark Dymond), a cleric (Steven Elder), a rogue (Tim Stern), a hot warrior woman (Ellie Chidzey) and an elf girl mage (Lucy Gaskell). The stunning Clemency Burton-Hill is also on hand as the nobleman's wife who does her part to help save Ismir. The towering Chidzey (511) is nice & curvy rather than unappealingly thin, like the stereotypical model.

Although I've never played Dungeons & Dragons, I read one of the books years ago and numerous others from the sword & sorcery genre, especially Conan, Gor and ERB, not to mention numerous sword & sorcery flicks (some being sword & NO sorcery, like ""First Knight"" and ""King Arthur,"" lol). Anyway, this second Dungeons & Dragon movie works just good enough for me to give it a decent grade. Although it was relatively low-budget (Im actually surprised it cost $15 million) it's generally superior to the typical Syfy fare and thoroughly austere compared to the campy first film. I liked how the writers actually threw in some nice character bits, like the developing friendship/respect of the rogue and the barbarian. They should've included more.

""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a fitting title because you get your fill of both. There are numerous dungeon scenes with torches and secret passageways, as well as two impressive dragon sequences, one featuring an ice dragon and another with the mountain dragon who looks like Satan himself. On top of this you get some quality forest locations and Medieval sets.

THE FILM RUNS 105 minutes was shot in Lithuania. WRITERS: Robert Kimmel, Lively (the director) and Brian Rudnick.

2405401,3,B000B7QCG8,"Judged as a movie in general, this isn't very good. In fact, it's below average. Not bad, but below average. In star-rating terms: 2 stars.

But, judged specifically as a D&D movie, it's actually pretty good. In fact, it's above average. Not great, but above average. In star-rating terms: 4 stars.

So, on average, I'd say this is an average-quality, 3-star movie.

And, for D&D players, it's a treat to watch the extra bit in which Gary Gygax assesses how well certain specific elements of the movie accord with his vision of D&D.",1329955200,,532,4.698924731182796

There are all the elements to a perfect adventure. Well most of this movie is funny only if you have played D&D (any edition)because of game refernces and such, however that being said some of the movie is easy for the average person to watch and understand just in general. The graphic/special FX were decent and played together nicely with the whole plot. I found the theif, the barbarian, and the cleric to be my favorite charaters. as for the service, The product arrived quickly and without any damage. It also played without skipping.

2405433,1,B000B7QCG8,"The second installment in this ongoing travesty has an even lower budget than the first. If you enjoy D&D (or were a fan in your youth) you will get more satisfaction from staring at the cover art for five minutes than any scene in the movie. Remember that kid in your D&D group who was always snort-laughing at his own lame jokes and spouting dorky ideas that made you cringe? Yeah. He wrote the script. Evidently some people have the idea that the more you love the game, the better you are at writing/directing a screenplay. This is not true. Another popular myth: if you truly love the game you will look past the flaws in any D&D movie. This is a campaign based game where each adventure has a beginning, middle, and end. It's tailor-made for the cinematic format! To the executives at Wizards of the Coast: Budget some money for a quality screenwriter because it doesn't matter how much you spend on visual effects; you can't polish a turd.",1251331200,3,946,4.538011695906433
2405434,4,B000B7QCG8,I enjoyed this movie which is what movie making is all about. A simple storyline and interesting characters add to the overall experience as well. Very few corners were cut in the special effects dept. The fighting sequences could have been staged better but overall I did buy this movie and therefore do rank it as a pretty good flick. The shipping was fast and well done. A happy customer.,1248912000,2,391,4.6
2405435,4,B000B7QCG8,"I saw the original theatrical film, and it was a big disappointment for me. However, Wrath of the Dragon God does not disappoint. Solid performances by the cast and a *much* better script make for a much better film. Its weakness is in some the special effects, but given the budget, they did well. It is a pity that this script was not the original theatrical release, and I hope to see more by the same scriptwriters. Since others have done a great job of summarizing the film, I will only say that (1) it was great to see strong female characters contributing to a team effort, and (2) skip the commentary audio track.",1240704000,2,621,4.456140350877193

2405437,5,B000B7QCG8,"I watched the original D&D movie with a grimace and haven't watched it since. So when I saw that this movie on tv, I was debating whether to switch it off, instead I watched it and was pleasantly surprised. It was a D&D movie, it had clerics and divine magic, something which was ignored by the first film. There were dungeon hacks and fights with creatures from the actual books. The acting wasn't grating and the cast clearly threw themselves into the plot with gusto.

The special effects aren't A class but they aren't puppets either. There are no huge continuity errors and the plot was fast paced, fun and contrary to some opinion exactly the same as a standard D&D adventure: Bunch of heroes sent to find orb so that town can be saved from evil, basic d&d plottage. Enjoyable for both D&D fans and those who aren't.",1239062400,2,822,4.516778523489933
2405438,2,B000B7QCG8,"Let's face it -- when you're making a sequel to one of the worst movies ever made, there are only so many ways you can get it wrong.

And ""Dungeons and Dragons - Wrath of the Dragon God"" is nowhere near that level -- it makes a genuine effort to be a passable fantasy-quest movie. Unfortunately it's too short to make the characters come alive, and the decent quest-for-magical-object-of-impending-doom comes completely unraveled in the last twenty minutes. Still, it's no ""In the Name of the King.""

Former knight Berek (Mark Dymond) and his mage wife Melora (Clemency Burton-Hill) learn that the dragon-god Falazure is waking in his mountain prison, where the ancient Turanian mages stuck him. This is because the evil Damodar has captured the orb that contains Falazure's power, and is waking the dragon to ruin the entire world. And he's turning Melora into a zombie (don't ask me how).

With only a matter of days before Falazure wakes, the king appoints Berek the head of a small team that follows the usual pattern -- the elf wizard Ormaline (Lucy Gaskell), berserker barbarian Lux (Ellie Chidzey), cleric Dorian (Steven Elder) and thief Nim (Tim Stern). They have to infiltrate Damodar's fortress of evilness and steal the orb -- but the only way to locate it is through bandits, a Lich, an ice-spewing dragon, lethal traps and so on and so forth...

I will admit that ""Dungeons and Dragons - Wrath of the Dragon God"" has open affection for D&D, and clearly is the work of a D&D fan -- lots of shout-outs and homages to places, people and situations that come from the role-playing games, among other things. It's kind of likable in its earnest attempt to, if not make an epic classic fantasy movie, then at least make a movie worth watching.

That said, the story itself is a mess. The first two-thirds are very slow, with spurts of awkward sword-fighting, cheeze-galore dialogue (""The forces of evil hear the call of the orb... they wait to pick the rotting dead carcass of Ismer!""), and random plot twists (let's escape ghosts on a RAFT!). The entire quest is a series of traps, tricks and  near-disasters, usually handled via a tool or ability that the heroes didn't display five minutes ago.

And in the last stretch the plot completely unravels, leading to a climax with a lot of bad dragon-related CGI, dozens of artfully posed dead bodies, and a literal deus ex machina. In short, the entire plot feels like it was made up along the way -- especially since seemingly-important items (like the ""smite"" ring) don't serve any plot purpose at all.

The characters are a little better, mainly because the actors are clearly trying so hard -- especially the wonderfully dry-witted Stern and the wholehearted woman-warrior Chidzey, who sadly gets some of the worst dialogue (""Come, villainy. Death awaits you""). Unfortunately the characterization is spotty and localized (including a horribly strained ""sorry I killed your brother and stuff"" conversation).

The weirdest part is what happens to half the cast --  one expires early on doing something stupid, having had zero impact on the plot. And two others are left in critical condition and... that's it. We never hear about them again.

""Dungeons and Dragons- Wrath of the Dragon God"" has the dubious honor of being a made-for-TV sequel better than its predecessor, and it's amusing in a kitschy turn-your-brain-off low-budget manner. But those hoping for solid characterization and plotting better check elsewhere.",1237420800,4,3478,4.938356164383562

I am a D&D gamer for seven years now,and have no intensions to stop playing, so I could understand the way iconic monsters, spells and game mechnics were waved into the plot.
Thing is, this movie is so bad that it made me angry. It is becuse of things such as ""Wrath of the dragon god"" that D&D is underastimated by many people. The plot was infantile, the charcters so boering that as a DM I would have killed their players just for the intension to play them.
Another issiue was that the charcters had no in game logic- I remember a scene where the fighter (who is, of course, the leader) send the wizard to the front line of a large meele battle, to cover him while he solves a riddle.

I watched this last night to preview it prior to showing it to my children since it doesn't have a rating. Parent's don't fear... it's a PG movie. No profanity, only a tiny bit of blood and entirely unbelievable special effects. For those of you who watched the first movie, this one is different, I'm not sure I would say ""Better."" The special effects in the first were better, these were 100% made for TV effects, so don't go into this movie expecting incredible dragons and unbelievable spells. Unlike the first movie, this one DID follow the rules of the D&D game much more closely, though they still took several liberties. For example Dragons in the game are supposed to be far smarter than humans and capable of speaking in just about any language they like... here they are just large beasts with sharp teeth that are quite easily killed. There was a Lich in this movie... although it's quite easy to tell he's just a guy in a bad mask. I really didn't enjoy this movie. It was boring, the acting was along the lines of a daytime soap, the FX were laughable on some occasions, the plot was alright but didn't really do much for me. This may have been better as a mini series if they had fleshed out more of the steps in their journey. As parents we still aren't sure if we are going to let the kids watch it... not because it's inappropriate, but because we are afraid they might like it and we might have to sit through it several more times.

2405464,3,B000B7QCG8,"This is one of the better Dungeons and Dragons type movies. The story, cast, effects , and music are all good. Typically at least two of those things fail in many of them. I sat through the whole movie without any wretching or desire to leave the room, which was a pleasant surprise. The story centers around a retired captain of the guard taking command of a group of five champions to fight an evil wizard. The group is comprised of the captain, a female warrior, a male thief, a female wizard, and a male cleric. The characters are well developed during their journey together and work well together. Initially with the right amount of friction and later trusting each other with their life and limb literally. A nice mix of mythical creatures, and the effects were as good as any I have seen. If you enjoy fantasy movies like ""Stardust"", ""Earthsea"", and ""George and the Dragon"", I recommend it. The only thing missing was a little humor.

2405466,3,B000B7QCG8,"If you hated the first D&D movie for bad acting, bad writing (who else besides me cheered when the extremely annoying ""Snails"" finally kicked the bucket?), don't give this one a pass just because it's a sequel. Actually, the writers were wise in retaining the only decent character from the first film, Damodar, to be the bad guy. (Although sadly, he's lost his neon blue lipstick in this film.)

***SPOILER ALERT***

THIS go round, the movie is set a hundred years later, the plot is decent, the acting decent, and oh my gosh! They ACTUALLY paid attention to character classes! When you meet THIS movie's thief, you know he's actually a THIEF, and that's how he makes his living. The barbarian is a surprise, but very well-played. While the actor's expressions are a little wooden at times, and there's a couple of continuity blips (i.e. supporting cast is in one clip, and when you go back, they've suddenly vanished with no explanation), it's overall an enjoyable film for longterm gamers.

And while the action (and hack and slash) are pretty cool, it's the mage Mallora who steals the show---along with some truly creative traps, and a lich secondary character. It's definitely worth the rental, or even adding to your home collection. I hope, should further movies ensue, that they will continue improving... because the rate of improvement over the first movie, to this one, is truly vast. I give it three stars because there are areas where the dialog or reactions are a bit wooden, and the story a bit predictable... but it's enormously better than the first film, and should've been the one released in theatres.

One area I was a little disappointed in was the musical score: very inconsistent. They had some nice ""celtic music"" type segments... but for the scenes with full orchestral arrangement, the music failed to add enough to the suspense and to help build the action. I'd like to see them get someone like Alan Silvestri, Howard Shore, or Gerry Goldsmith for a third movie, to score the music.",1196553600,4,2012,4.823188405797102
2405467,1,B000B7QCG8,"It's worse than a tv show in terms of acting, and plot. The special effects are good but they were rarely used. The story is boring. Besides, it drags on and on in many scenes. I felt asleep while watching it.

It's not worth viewing at all.",1194220800,,241,4.127659574468085
2405468,4,B000B7QCG8,"You'll know whether or not this movie is your cup of tea. If you love over-the-top, somewhat well done, adventure movies, you'll love this. And if you like Dungeons and Dragons, all those little things will make it that much better. Basically a leader assembles a team of different classes to fight a great evil. It's a cliche plot, but it should be a cliche plot. That's what it's going for in my opinion. The special effects are entertaining. The cleric has a giant hammer that looks like it weighs about 1 pound. The dragon makes sure never to touch any buildings because then the production team would have to deal with making them look destroyed. All the effects are both passable and laughable, the perfect blend of terrible and wonderful.

For guys who are going to watch this, some of the women are extremely attractive, no matter their acting.

Special effects?  Laughably bad.  D&D enthusiasts will probably legitimately enjoy the film... but this review is for the rest of us.

What is notable is the audio commentary.  Apparently they couldn't get the writer, director, or any of the cast for that matter.  They had to go and get game developers to comment on the movie... and even they couldn't take it seriously.  The commentary really is parody as the game designers pretend that they are Orc-barbarians, halflings, and the like commenting on the adventurers in the film.  Too funny.  Rent it, laugh at it, then return it.",1184112000,2,758,4.782945736434108
2405471,1,B000B7QCG8,"Dungeons & Dragons-Wrath of the Dragon God (DVD)

I guess when Hollywood gets really desperate they start looking for different things they can make a movie out of.  You know comic books, toys, board games, computer games, etc.  I wonder what's next?

One would hope they'd read one of David Weber's or John Ringo's books and make a movie from it.  The Honor Harrington series would be good or the Empire of Man series.

Dungeons & Dragons began life as a quest board game.  You know one of those you wander around looking in every door, chamber, or hidey hole you can seeking:

- Tools,
- weapons, or
- Items of power, such as rings and such.

Meanwhile while you're searching something or the other is trying to kill you.  These combats are interspersed on occasions with long spells of absolute boredom until the end of the game, if you survive, to have some kind of dramatic, climatic battle

Unfortunately making a movie out of boring game results in a boring movie.  The computer game, at least tests your skill somewhat.

In the movie, the evil Damodar does not fear death.  He's already dead and the champion must save the world before his girlfriend becomes undead herself.  Rotting from the feet upward, so hurry, guy.

There are five champions seeking the black orb that has been hidden for a thousand years.  That means that four are expendable.  You'll just have to guess at which four go ""Tango Uniform"".

Now that I've watched it one time I'm wondering who I can give it to, hmm, maybe my stepson who likes Ghost Rider

Don't waste your money on this one.

I saw this in some random manner, on cable, bored probably.  I love this genre, long time RPG player, and fantasy buff, but after seeing the first one, I must have been truly board to watch this.

Imagine my surprise when I was COMPLETELY entranced!  It was great fun! Not just following the ""rules"" of D&D, but telling a good story, with well done dialog and acting, (again, no critic, but I know what I like).

It's not a ""blockbuster"", I imagine it had a low budget, but very well worth the cost of the DVD.  Give this a look if you like the genre, and were disappointed with the first.",1181779200,2,673,4.301587301587301
2405483,4,B000B7QCG8,"This is a good solid D&D movie. All the basic character types are represented well in the film and they haven't tried to adapt it to what hollywood think a good movie should be. In the first movie the central rogue character was your typical hollywood charismatic heroic good guy with a comic relief sidekick. There's none of that here. The rogue is what you'd expect. Someone of dubious morals who does most of his things for money.

The traps were well done in the dungeons but the mage who went on the adventure could have been done better, no magic missile or anything. I think she was throwing lightning bolts constantly but they were not used correctly. There even was a cleric of Obad-Hai(shock horror to the bible belt) but I didn't see him use any healing magic.

In general most characters in the film were a little one dimensional except for the main two but they were well done in that dimension.

Btw Damodar is the same character from the first film cursed by Jeremy Irons' mage charcter into a state of undeath for failing him. (The curse automatically went off when Irons died at the end of the first film). So the character is a fighter. With the help of some evil priests in his service at the start of the movie he recovers an artifact and any magic he performs through the movie is through the use of the artifact, nothing else. The Lich even tells him that he's not capable of using it to its fullest potential! He is not a sorceror!",1174867200,,1454,4.438202247191011

This movie is actually more faithful to the game than the first installment. There is a wider variety of recognizable links to the wonderful role-playing game. More identifiable creatures, spells and character types.

Even with this in mind, the movie is not all that hot. The story is very linear and without a lot of surprises or intrigue. To equate it to a D & D adventure, this is a very decent Hack-n-slash adventure put on film. The grand plot and world developing are left for another time.

The CGI monsters and spell effects are well done but appear a little fake when integrated into the background. When you are requesting a full-sized dragon to be on screen, CGI is the only way to go so the creators were limited in that respect.

This movie is worth picking up if you are a long-time fan or want a good taste of the D & D universe. If you are not sure, rent it and see if you want to make the purchase.",1168992000,4,1141,4.317757009345795

The antagonist, Damodar, breathes an evil darkness into this movie rounding out the usually love and adventure fantasy movie. All the characters played their classes well and were never dull to watch. The dragon encounters are quite awesome and wonderful to behold on the screen as well.

2405488,2,B000B7QCG8,"It is said that the second `Dungeons and Dragons' film is closer to its source material, one of the most popular roll playing games. Is it? I have never played that game, but if people say so, it must be. But what really matters is the movie itself. Is it fun?

It may be to some viewers, but not to me. What I see just a B-action/fantasy film, a straight-to-video movie that severely suffers from its low-budget origin. Except for some shots of the big dragon, the special effects need improvement, so are the make-ups done to some of the actors.

Bruce Payne returns as Damodar, evil sorcerer who steals a black orb in order to destroy the kingdom of the protagonist Berek (Mark Dymond). To stop this plan, Berek and four characters travel deep into the world of fantasy and magic, and the long, rather disjointed story begins.

Many reviewers say (and I imagine many of them are fans of the original game) that the sequel is better than the first film starring hammy Oscar winner Jeremy Irons. There are no cheesy effects of flying dragons here, no more irritating comic relief, and no Thora Birth in golden chain mail. Though their opinions are understandable, however, I beg to differ.

For I loved the first film (which was ridiculed by many) because it never takes itself seriously. It was campy, even silly if I may say so, but at least it was trying to be fun. This sequel may have more actions, but the editing is still bad; it shows more CGI, but the quality is not much better. And most of all, the second `D&D' film has less enjoyment in following the adventures of the characters with the drab images and more serious-minded characters played by serious-minded actors.

On nearly every level improvement is done in `Dungeons and Dragons,' but the end results are in fact an ordinary B-film without any significant merit.",1166227200,,1834,4.630769230769231

Not to say that an AD&D movie can't be better - there is always room for improvement. As one poster above mentioned that the movie uses characters from the game and that to me is what put the sequel higher above the first.

I share the same caveat in that Damodar was never a sorcerer and still isn't! Wrath of the Dragon God is left open ended and Damodar could return to wreak havoc again, so is the main protagonist in the storyline.

But this is no ordinary powerful magic object.  This is a weapon of magical destruction that could end the world.  It is tied to a giant black dragon that is a god and this god is about to wake up and resume control.

Of course we have to have a balanced party of adventurers to go and try and stop the bad things from happening.  We have spell casters, warriors, and thieves who must cast magic, fight and avoid traps.  But not only do they have to complete their mission before the world ends under the dragon god, but they must complete it before a character's loved one succumbs to a spell (can we say priorities?).

There is plenty of action and special effects for anyone looking for that sort of thing.  The plot is not quite as sappy as in the first movie but there is nothing surprising to anyone familiar with D&D or fantasy role playing games.  In some ways I like it better than the first although ultimately the plot is even more designed to ward off the idea of D&D being linked to Satanism and other bad things.

This take was better in that at least the core game design came through in spots.  The characters were all described in decent detail and the story set-up as if a DM read it to interested players.  While no one who watches this film ought to expect high art and spectacular special effects, it does a good enough job in both areas to make it a convincing D&D film.  Plot is a bit basic, and the crew I watched the movie with had it figured out well before it was halfway through.  It was interesting enough not to earn yawns and ""do-something-else"" looks from the crowd here.  To the rules-lawyers in the group, the appearance of a white dragon from seemingly nowhere, and the way the lich came across on a personal seemed too canned and out of place.

If you are a long-time D&D player, it's worth a rental.  If you're interested in the movie just because it's related to D&D, find an avid group of players and you'll get a better idea of the concepts of the game and scope of adventure, and very likely end up with a better storyline.",1151971200,,1174,4.324200913242009

I like cheesy movies, but D&D 2 was pretty much as bad as it gets. With the exception of the actor who played Nim (the Rogue), most of the acting was of the quality produced by first year drama majors reading lines from a script.

Now comes a made-for Sci-Fi Channel sequel. I thought, yeah another Sci-Fi cheapie film with horrible production values and cartoonish CGI and wooden acting. I rented it anyway and was very suprised to find out how good it was. Granted, it was obviously made on a limtited budget, but it was above-average for a Sci-Fi Channel film. The film makers obviously had a love for the source material and took great pains to remain faithful to the spirit of D&D.

The plot is standard stuff: A city is in peril from a gathering Evil and a select few must become its champions and go forth on a quest to retrive a magical artifact and destroy said Evil once and for all.

All of the actors in their respective roles do a competent job of portraying their 'class'. However, the female Barbarian was more eye candy than anything else.

Bottom line: If you are a fan of D&D, rent it. The extras on the DVD are informative and entertaining, except the audio commentary. On the DVD I had, I could not hear Ed Stark( special projects manager for Wizards of the Coast) and the two other people on the track were in 'character' of a halfling thief and half-orc fighter.

That being said, this movie is nowhere near as horrible as the first one. The effects are better, the story is way better, and the acting is not nausea inducing.

I've played D&D forever and I appreciate the subtle nods to the genre that the movie did give, but any of these reviews that you read that say the movie was fantastic and a total homage to D&D are full of crap.

It's not terrible, the first one showed what a bad treatment for D&D could be. And while I really wanted this one to be good, it was just your average Sci-Fi channel C grade movie.

Take this on board if you will: the writers are deep into the fantasy genre so this comes out as a real script. The film is lower in budget than the first but it actually turns out a better film with special effects that really look the business.

The story goes that an undead sorcerer (from the first but you really don't need to know that) has finally found an orb with great power - enough for him to conquer those who cast him out. Problem is its awakening a dragon-god who lusts only to destroy the world that imprisoned him.

In a rush to survive 5 heroes are called to steal the orb back. A sarcastic thief, famed magician, a barbarian with a dark past, a cleric of great power and a knight who recently has noticed how washed up he really is. But in faith they are sent out in a race against time, tricks, plots, ploys, traps and powerful enemies to find a way to save the world.

This film has so much of everything fun, hair-raising escapes, tricks and traps to survive and a pace that pulls you through.

2405533,3,B000B7QCG8,"Obviously this film is bound to draw parallels with the first DnD film as well as Lord of the Rings.  Allow me to state that a comparison with either is really not appropriate.

The first DnD film was, well, a disaster.  The characters were unlikable, the plot was awful, and it was an overall horrific film.  Shame on Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch!  Talk about wasted potential... two phenomenal actors, a large budget, and that was the best the folks involved could do?

As for LotR... Get over it already!  First of all, DnD =/= LoTR.  Secondly, LotR had a multimillion dollar budget, a cast of big name actors, and several years to shoot, and 8 hours of film to get the viewer drawn into.  This is a small-budget film with a cast of not-so-famous actors made to fit a television schedule.  Finally, this film is based on DnD stereotypes.  Gamers will argue for the next century whether or not the DnD Core characters are somehow related to the characters in LotR.  Personally, I fall on the side of ""no, they are not"".  Even going back to the original back in the 70's, there were enough differences to say that DnD, the game, is at best loosely-inspired by Tolkien.

Now, if you watch this as a stand-alone film, it really isn't all that terrible.  The archetypical characters are played to the hilt... the imposing barbarian who hacks her foes, the cleric who provides some sage wisdom and not a bad fight (oh, and for the record, the producers ought to learn...NEVER GET THE PARTY HEALER KILLED!), the roguish thief (I know, I know, repetitive, but it sounds better than saying ""roguish rogue"") who is more concerned with treasure and traps than saving the world, the noble fighter on a quest leading the ragtag group, and the aloof elf caster who really doesn't understand the silly humans but is helping because loss would hurt her race as well.  They were enjoyable characters, with just the right amount of tension to be a believable party of adventurers who were thrust together as opposed to choosing to adventure together.

The plot was a typical DnD adventure.  Set up something for a quest, summon adventurers, hack and slash, and then the ending.  Ok, not academy material, but it's not supposed to be!  The effects were a bit better this time around if only because they folks who worked on this film actually put some effort into making this a movie instead of a Saturday morning cartoon like the first one.  A better array of foes and monsters sure to please any gamer.  And how can we forget the ring of the Ram?  A classic little treasure.

So, with heaps of praise, why only 3.5 stars?  A few reasons.  It was too short, and at times it felt rushed.  I would have liked to have seen more plot and character development.  While the production was good, I can see why it became a ""SciFi Original"" instead of a theatrical release in the states.  And while I enjoyed it, it's hardly going to get a rating equal to something like ""13th Warrior"" or some of the other fantasy film I *realy* enjoy.

D&D-WTDG is about as good a translation as one could expect without going in to epic characters from some of the games settings.

I'd rate the accuracy of this movie with any D&D pen&paper game against the accuracy of the Lord of the Rings movies -- its that good if you're a ""purist"" looking for a screen re-creation of the game.

I haven't played in years, and yet I saw the little details most might miss, like the searches for secret doors, who actually spotted them, etc.

I also liked the realism, in that not all of the characters lived until the end -- bad choices equal bad ends for some.

I thought the actor who played the Thief did a good job of adding a bit of humor to the movie without giving up his tough-guy image.  Much different than, say, Conan the Destroyer's laughable thief and overall cheesiness.

This movie takes itself seriously and pursues accuracy with zeal, and I suppose that is the best thing about it.  Because so few game adaptations do (Street Fighter?)  Considering the sheer number of people who engage in online RPG's these days like Everquest, I would guess that there is a market, however small, for a movie like this.",1139616000,2,1532,4.4784172661870505
2405537,3,B000B7QCG8,"Dungeons and Dragons 2 - Wrath of the Dragon God is definitely a better film than the first.  The Acting is mostly decent, the story palletable and the direction actually has a little mystique to it.

However, it tries a little too hard to appeal to the game's fan base.  There's nothing wrong with being faithful to the source material, but at times the characters seem to be reciting lines from the DnD Player's Handbook instead of a screenplay.  Also when the hero forms the party at the beginning of the movie, one must wonder how a couple of high ranking government officials know some of these characters-The Cleric and the Mage I buy, but government officials don't usually have thieves and Barbarians on speed dial(or whatever the high fantasy equivalent is).  And lastly Bruce Payne still ham's his role up although he has toned it down a little from the last film.

While none of this is enough to drag the movie down completely, it still lacks the punch to be anything more than an amusing B-movie.  And it lacks the inept charm that made the first DnD such a fun cinematic cheese-fest.  I guess better isn't always better.",1139356800,3,1134,4.635

Now take that and think about what it's like to sit in the room watching other people playing an RPG when you're not a part of the game... BOOOOOORING.  That's pretty much what this movie is.

While the scenario might give one or two campaign thread ideas, you're much better off doing a little reading on the net for ideas. I had a hard time staying awake trying to watch this on SciFi. The acting is dull and uninspired. I didn't care a whit about the characters and when one dies, I just think -- ""Well, time for the director to roll up a new one...""

Sometimes even when you see a bad B-movie, it at least looks like the actors are having a little fun with their acting, even if they're hamming it up. In this, it didn't even look like the actors were enjoying it. More like they were thinking, ""My career has sunk to this?""

Seriously, this movie is a waste of time. The fact that it is often referred to as ""better than the first"" makes me utterly thankful I never saw the first.

If you're absolutely dying to own every piece of fantasy movie fiction ever created, I don't know why you're bothering to read the reviews... but for my money, I'd rather watch a classic B-movie fantasy like Legend, Labrynth or even Krull than this (ok, maybe not Krull... but you get the idea).

Do yourself a favor and watch Lord of the Rings again.  After those, we may never see another good fantasy movie in our lifetimes (unless the movie rights to The Hobbit finally get settled and Jackson gets a crack at that one too). Oh...

New Line and Sweetpea Entertainment were still hurting from their massive losses on the original film when they sold the franchise rights off to Warner Brothers, who in turn sold the international rights to whomever would take them.

As a result, Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath Of The Dragon God is available in Australia under its working title of Dungeons & Dragons: The Elemental Might. Those who are fed up with the incessant delays can always source the disc from there if they are capable of playing PAL discs. For everyone else, the film is really not worth getting worked up about. Yes, it is better in technical terms than the original, but that takes away the main reason to see these films. In the absence of incompetence, Wrath Of The Dragon God simply becomes boring for the most part. The mass battle with Death Knights promised in pre-production never materialises, and it is only the desire to see the heroine shake off Damodar's curse that gives us any reason to watch.

I think the girl mage was actually reading the script as she was acting out her scenes, very flat and not putting much into her role.

With a comment to the reviewer who talked about the elf, elves in D & D are alot different from the the ones in Middle Earth, so she might have been trying to cover both and not doing too well at either.

2405572,3,B000B7QCG8,"Sometimes you just gotta trust what people say and save what precious hours of your life remain; which is to say, I didn't waste any time on the first D&D film. This review is written about one film and one film only: D&D 2: Wrath of the Dragon God.

As far as fantasy films go, this one comes off as a middle of the road production. The budget allocated for the film was enough to create a believeable backdrop of medieval proportions. Plot-wise, it's not unlike what you'd find in any heroic epic: a hero averts a great disaster that will befall his society.

The characters, while little more than archetypes, do little to make you care about them and barely develop as the film unfolds (though this is not unusual for the genre). There is occasional interplay, mind you, but you'd probably be better served with a second or third viewing of Conan the Destroyer.

Truth be told, I watched this movie strictly from a gamer's perspective and I suppose that's what drew me to it in the first place. If you play D&D, then the film holds your attention: the rules mechanics behind D&D are rendered in accurate terms; the creatures with whom the characters interact are straight out of the monster manual; and nearly every aspect of this film suceeds in conveying what it feels like to sit down to an evening of gaming, eating pizza, and rolling d20s, but not necessarily in that order.

If you have ever played D&D, this is an enjoyable way to kill a couple hours til your game starts. If not, then rent Lord of the Rings. Or Hamlet. Or the 13th Warrior (an excellent Beowulf remake, btw). Or the Princess Bride.

If, however, you're interested in more of this type of stuff, check out a film called 'The Gamers,' by Dead Gentlemen productions. By comparison, there are many more instances of hilarity and intertextuality between gamers and the games they inhabit.",1137369600,5,1862,4.613293051359516

2) It really is fun picking out the familiar elements from the D&D game, such as spells, items, classes, and monsters.

3) The plot is acceptable; nothing extraordinary, but not pathetic either.

On the negative side:

1) The special effects are actually worse than the original.

""Cheap B-movie"" is written all over; the goblin village consisted of a couple of huts, the corpse of the dark elf looked like a doll one could buy from a toy store, the lich looks like he is wearing a cheap Halloween mask from Wall Mart, while Damodar has some unidentifiable and sad looking creature serving him who seems to have done his own make-up, to mention just few...

2) The actors and the acting are amateurish to say the least; green and straight out of acting school or pulled out of a neighborhood retiree theater club.

The actress playing the elven mage; has she read any Tolkien or D&D novels in order to play her character? Has she even watched any, let alone all three, of the Lord of the Rings movies to get some idea of what she is doing? And of course not a single word of elvish is spoken during the movie.

The Barbarian does not look, act or resemble a barbarian; quite civilized I thought.

The priest was good as a cleric devoted to nature, but he doesn't stick around much...

The rogue is a short old man who in the middle of the dungeon laughs (!!!) when the mage's figurine of wondrous power is destroyed, while successfully finding a deadly trap!

The young and promising captain of the guard whose character is built up in the beginning is gone in a split second.

The king and the mages looked like they did not belong.

3) The dialogues are below average. Why? The writers should know...

4) It lacks efficient character development. The characters are, overall, bland and underdeveloped.

5) The movie doesn't flow; at times it is abrupt and without continuity.

Perhaps... just perhaps, it is better than the first film.  I'm not sure.  I can say this, however; this film is TERRIBLE.  The acting is strained, and the special effects are weak.  We got the most enjoyment out of it that we could by making fun of the movie as it progressed, a task made significantly easier by the fact that it got worse as it went along.

I mean this seriously, however... For anyone to give this movie 5 stars, or even 4 is a crime.  5 star ratings are for movies like Lord of the Rings, with actual production value, good casting, and decent scripts.  Even if you want to compare it to other low budget movies and suggest that, in that event, it deserves a 5 star rating, you need to think seriously about it.  While amusing, this is not even a good B-movie.

If there is a positive aspect of the movie, it is that it will reach out to some gamers, giving them things to recognize from D&D.  The ring of the ram made a nice cameo, as did a few spells and token names (Obad-Hai).

Take my word for it... this movie is garbage.  It really isn't worth your time.  There are plenty of good fantasy movies out there.  And really, the couple of hours you spend watching this movie would be better spent watching one of them, or playing an RPG.",1134259200,13,1398,4.282442748091603

All in all a fun romp, on par with Krull and Hawk the Slayer, just a notch down from The Princess Bride and Ladyhawke.  Leaps and bounds above Phantom Menace.",1130803200,9,492,4.627906976744186
2405589,5,B000B7QCG8,"I did enjoy the first D&D, I must admit. It shouldn't have been based on D&D though or given the title. It would've made more sense if it were its own, non-based-on-a-game movie. That way, D&D fans wouldn't have compared it to the board game and been disappointed. But, I still liked the first.

Now, onto this sequel (which really should be considered the first in a trilogy of D&D movies, only if they keep to the same concept as this one), it was great. My mom and I decided to watch it at my grandmother's house to keep her company, and because I been waiting awhile to watch it. We just loved it. I was kinda skeptical at first, because let's face it, SciFi original movies suck big time. I was scared that this movie would have total crap special effects and way, way bad acting. (Watch SciFi's Alien Express and Bloodsuckers to catch my drift.) I was relieved that this was so awesome and serious. Not all goofy and stuff. It had great mythical characters banding together to stop an awesome villain (from the first) and his allies from gaining control of an orb that would control an almighty Dragon (hence the name ""Wrath of the Dragon God"") from wrecking havoc on the Kingdom of Izmer (which, by the way, on the first they pronounced it Izmer ""IZMEER,"" and on this sequel they pronounce it like it was ""ISHMEER,"" weird, huh?) anyway, the special CGI effects are great for a made-for-tv movie as well as the acting and landscapes and set pieces. The Dragon's on here look way more ferocious that on the first film, and you actually see our heroes journeying to find the orb, like they're actually on a quest (where-as-to the first film, a scene would appear, and the heroes would be in a different kingdom or something without actually seeing of their travels and obstacles {well, besides the maze, but that isn't travel, it's just an obstacle}). Also, they're are a bunch of traps and stuff in this one. So, in closing, I must say that this DVD, coming out November 8th, is on my Christmas wish list, and I can't wait to see it without those overly long commercials. Also, the barbarian is hot, and even the female wizard. Not to mention the Priestess. In other words, all the fems in here are hot. And for you ladies, you may find the knight and the cleric as hot.

HOWEVER. This is an incredibly fun movie. Unlike the original, this film capture the fun of the cheesy sword and sorcery movies from the 80s. The movie takes its subject dead seriously and chooses to respect it rather than make fun of it, again completely unlike the original. This truly feels like a dungeon and dragons movie and the writer and director should be commended for this creation. While the acting, dialogue, and effects or not so great its to be expected with a budget of less than 15 million. While the special effects they had were not up to par, I did enjoy them for their variety. Fans of Dungeons and dragons will see a variety of creatures and spells from the game (something also lacking from the original). To name a few you will see a Lich, Ghosts, Frost Dragon, Undead Dragon, Undead Wizard, Half-Orc, Elves, Barbarians, Priests, Warriors, Wizards, Rogues, Demons, Fire Elementals, and many others. So while the quality is low, the feeling of a good cheesy fantasy film emenates from every corner of this film. I highly recommend it.

Some will see this as the movie's strong point and many will see it as the movie's failing. Let's just say I fall in the former category - I've played D&D for years - and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I think this movie would be especially suited to the young Harry Potter crowd - not in the same league perhaps, but a diverting fantasy none the less. For young people, it also might serve as a good introduction to the world of the Dungeons and Dragons Role-Playing Game (RPG).

Mind you, this is no Lord of the Rings - it's not going to win any ""Academy Awards."" But unlike the insufferable first ""Dungeons and Dragons"" movie, at least this one is true to its namesake - finally a movie that REALLY DOES deserve the name ""Dungeons and Dragons"". It seems that so many movies released in the past few years having nothing in common with their title subject (The Saint, Mission Impossible, etc.).

""Wrath of the Dragon God"", without apology, completely embraces the archetypical D&D adventure and unabashedly incorporates every D&D clich there is. Sure it's all a bit hokey at times, but so is the D&D game itself. So is that a bad thing? Not in my book. Here you'll find all the quintessential D&D characters - the raging barbarian (female no less), the magic-wielding elf, the pious cleric, and the shifty rogue. Those of us who revel in the D&D fantasy universe of magic weapons, deadly traps, evil monsters, and nefarious villains will not go away disappointed. The only minor oversight was that the iconic Dwarf character was missing - an unfortunate omission probably due to budget constraints more than anything else.

I do agree with the comments made that the dialogue was a bit stilted and banal at times and that the plot might have been a little more refined. But neither of these two factors distracted from my enjoyment of the movie. Concerning the acting, I personally, found it to be superior to the typical fare served up by the Sci-Fi channel. I also thought the CGI special effects were a lot more polished and convincing than some of the other recent fantasy movies shown on TV like Hallmark's ""Hercules"" and ""Mysterious Island.""

Finally, if you play the D&D game, you might even find a few ideas to lift from the movie for your game - although it may be difficult to get away using any them if your players have seen this movie.

P.S. I do, respectfully, have to take issue with the reviewer who gave this move a rating of one star and who ""would rather watch grass grow"". When I read his comments, I thought for sure he was referring to the FIRST Dungeons and Dragons movie! Don't take my word for it though.

They used one character and tried to make it seem like it was 100 years later but it didn't work. There were possible subplots that could have gone somewhere but didn't.

Lively (Darkness Falls) has created that rarest of beasts: a sequel that, while being infinitely superior to the film it follows, is still pretty rotten.

Damodar (Bruce Payne) has survived the woefully bad first movie with his career more or less intact (Payne, not Damodar). He has wandered the land for a century (Damodar, not Payne), undead, looking for an artifact that will restore life to him-- the Elemental Orb, which contains the power of a trapped dragon god. (Already, you can see the spoilers in the title, yes?) When Damodar gets ahold of the orb, the dragon begins to stir, and five champions have to go get it back before said dragon god wakes up, reclaims his power, and destroys the world.

Cheesy plot, of course, but what do you expect? As well, it seems that everyone who's made a movie set before 1700 in the last few decades has decided that the best way to give the movie a medieval feel is to have all the characters overact, and this is no exception. There's enough scenery-chewing here for any ten of Charlton Heston's movies. Still, given the film's length, the action keeps it going at a reasonable pace, and the actors here are, for all their scenery-chewing, surprisingly good at what they do-- to the point that this movie is actually better-acted than the original, which had a much higher-powered cast.

While the script was not on par with recent fantasy/sci-fi fare (Lord of the Rings, Firefly/Serenity), it was much better written and closer to the spirit of the Dungeons & Dragons RPG than the first.  Experienced D&D gamers will appreciate the fact that the movie holds to most of the rules in terms what is possible, and non-gamers will find plenty of compelling action and a light enough plot to follow without the need to be well versed in the game.

The writer did an admirable job tying in this sequel with the original while distancing it enough so that it could be a completely different story.  Damodar, the main villain's henchman from the first film, is the Big Bad Evil Guy in this installment.  He is, as usual with B-list fantasy, wholly and irredeemably evil, but with semi-plausible motivation unlike his boss Profion in the first film.  The protagonists are somewhat clichd, but there are enough twists in their characterizations to keep their adventure fresh and interesting to watch.  All in all the acting and writing combine to make this movie as good as it is.

Such a film is not without its problems, though.  It is clear that D&D 2 had a smaller budget than the first movie, made obvious by the lack of star power or refined special effects.  I suppose that this is par for the course after such a miserable showing in the first movie, but it's hardly the way to cement a new following.  Also, the ending, while I will not spoil it here, seemed overly abrupt and somewhat unsatisfying.  Had the producer spent more money on fan recognizable talent or bigger effects shots and the writer taken the time to write a full ending, this movie would have merited 4 stars instead of 3.

As an avid gamer, I was relieved and happy to see one of my favorite games portrayed in a mostly accurate manner and that D&D 2 was much better than the cinematic disaster that preceeded it.  I recommend it to any current D&D players and all curious fantasy fans who REALLY want to know what D&D is all about.",1128816000,4,2109,4.589333333333333
2405596,4,B000B7QCG8,"I think the main thing that makes this movie so fun, is that it simplistically translates the D&D rpg into a film. Naturally the thief notices, and is more perceptive to things, the barbarian (An extremely sexy one, at that) shrugs off droves of enemies with hack and slash sword cleaves, the mage shows off flashy spells, and unique utility that only a magic user can bring (such as teleportation). Overall, I liked the first movie better though. It just seemed to have a better story than this one. On the flipside of that though, this sequal has a memorable cast (and a hottie barbarian chick) that I'd love to see again!",1128816000,2,624,4.580357142857143
2405597,3,B000B7QCG8,"Ok, I just watched it. It is a far cry better then that other garbage Courtney Solomon made. I hope for more. I know there is a gross (low) budget on this movie but they did it pretty well.

maybe one of these days A ""Peter Jackson"" will make a ""Dragonlance series"" (dare to dream).",1128729600,4,282,4.127272727272727
2405598,4,B000B7QCG8,"I just watched this movie on Sci-Fi. I am very pleased with this. I would not by any means actually call this a sequel to the first Dungeons and Dragons movie.

I loved the first one, but it didn't have the D&D feel to it. It was made out too much to be a comedy and too focused on controlling dragons.

Yet, this movie is outstanding. The visual effects and CGI were fantastic and well done (although at points the flying creatures could have had more work done). The scenery and lands were outstanding. The vast areas held more to the feel of trying to save many lands.

The only thing I have wrong with this was that the effects didn't match up too well with the actual camera work. They looked great just thinking about them separate, but together it had an odd feel to it. If the effects were lightened slightly or the camera work darkened they would have marged a little better and had a more genuine feel.

I loved that there were five heroes other than two as in the first film. This tied more into the game, as I don't think many people play with one character and one dungeon master (and I feel sad for you if you really do).",1128729600,,1135,4.2407407407407405
