2472935,4,B000CSTKKQ,"30 min + 15 min bonus powerhouse workouts and comes with a 4' long band. All are on the mat. Some are challenging but most of them are do-able. Ana cues very well but she doesn't encourage you by saying ""you look beautiful, you look great, smile, auuuuuuuuuu, etc."" (if you want to hear those). No shoes.",1168128000,17,304,4.350877192982456
2472936,5,B000CSTKKQ,This video is good for anyone who has done basic pilates before. The band adds another dimension that makes it feel more like a challenge than exercise.,1228348800,,152,4.666666666666667
2472937,5,B000CSTKKQ,"This is a great DVD although it is not for beginners.  I have been doing pilates for about a year (with an instructor) and I found this to be a challenging workout.  Some of the highlights for me were the peaceful atmosphere (filmed on a beach), the variety and challenge (lots of arm work as well as abs), and I like the length (about 30 minutes).  If you have some experience with pilates and know the basics I wouldn't shy away from this DVD but it provides a challenge for more experienced people, too.",1228262400,3,506,4.361702127659575
2472938,3,B000CSTKKQ,"I already purchased Ana Caban's Beginner Pilates Mat workout and was interested in adding resistance to it with the body band. So I got this DVD. However, I didn't find out until putting the DVD on that this is an intermediate level workout.

Many of the moves are very familiar to me already from the original mat workout. So I was easily able to follow Ana's directions without an explanation of each move. Many of the moves are doable (for me, those focusing on the arms and legs). And the addition of the resistance band actually helps me to keep my body in control and stretches/strengthens those areas even more than the original mat workout. But the most intense moves like the teaser are still impossible for me to do as she does them.

I don't see a ""beginner level"" DVD here unless I get the kit.",1226620800,5,806,4.476190476190476
2472939,5,B000CSTKKQ,"If you want to add a little bit of challenge to your workout, I would recommend this DVD.",1223683200,,89,4.0
2472940,5,B000CSTKKQ,"I normally do not write reviews ,but this was such a good dvd I had to. It is a very effective workout for 30 minutes you hit every muscle group .",1213228800,2,146,3.7419354838709675
2472941,4,B000CSTKKQ,"Loved this work out.  I use this between gym visits to keep flexable.  Great background, calm setting and a challenging work out.  The only improvement that could be made is the length.  I wish there could be more.",1211241600,,214,4.552631578947368
2472942,5,B000CSTKKQ,"I cannot get enough of her Pilates videos and how great of an instructor she is. When I first started with Pilates I didn't know what I was in for but she is so easy to follow and I love what every one of her videos is doing for my abs and overall well being! If you haven't tried pilates yet and are not sure of what dvd's to start with I would go with Ana Caban and don't look back. I have tried Windsor and just could not get into it at all, but Ana is fun and easy to stick to. I can't wait to see what other products she has in store!!!",1207958400,2,541,3.7130434782608694
2472943,5,B000CSTKKQ,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD.  The background is sooo gorgeous that it made this winter BEARABLE for me.  Sand, waves and even a seagull or two.  The work-out itself is still challenging for me after doing it almost every day for a month. If you have not tried working out with a resistance band...you will be very delighted. I can't go back to regular aerobics anymore after this dvd.  I LOVE the moves she uses also.  I'm NEVER bored. She uses a lot of ""fun"" moves that really work, which makes me come back for more.  I have 6 work-out dvd's and this is my definite favorite so far.  I have basically abandoned all of them except this one and one other that I alternate with this one. Bottom line...try it, you'll love it and feel like you've been on a vaca. on top of all of the physical benefits.  It's perfect.",1206921600,,814,4.309210526315789
2472944,5,B000CSTKKQ,"Very nice body band included and a great workout. Love the extra 20 minute bonus. As always, fantastic instruction by Ana. I always enjoy Ana's DVD's. She's as close as I can get to my Pilates class in case I don't make it! The Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss is another outstanding workout along with the Pilates Abs.",1205625600,2,322,4.568965517241379
2472945,5,B000CSTKKQ,"I bought this dvd at Target & hoped I would like it.... & guess what? I loved it, in fact I bought 5 more to give to friends.  It is a very good practise to do at home or on the road.  You have the body band to give you resistance & strength & it is just challenging enough to give you a really good workout & hope to improve each time...I think it is one of the best Pilates dvd's around.  I bought the Winsor tapes years ago & never got into them.  This is very user friendly.",1184976000,20,478,3.797979797979798
8101848,4,B000CSTKKQ,"I loved Ana Caban's first Pilates bodyband workout but you can only do the same workout so many times before you just need to move on.  When I originally bought this some years ago at a discount store, I did the workout once and put it away for a long time after that.  I guess I was not as fit then as I am now, because I found it difficult to complete at the time.  So if you are a beginner, this is probably not for you.  (If you are a beginner, get the first bodyband workout.  It is easier and has beginner modifications.)

But I tried this again yesterday and I loved it.  And I could get through 95% of it without struggling.  I mean, it was still challenging but I could actually complete almost all of the exercises with good form.  I guess I am in better shape now!

This (my version of it, anyway, which has the second cover variant shown in the product images (with green at the top and bottom) has two workouts.  The first is about 32 minutes and the second is about 15 minutes (it says 30 and 20 respectively, on the DVD jacket, but I guess 32 and 15 are close enough).

The first has a setting on a beach.  It's quite a pretty background and not at all distracting.  The bonus is in some studio and looks to be a bit older, as a workout.  The setting in the second is kind of strange and I'm not a big fan of the look of the room, but that is a minor detail.  I don't remember much about the music in either, which means it wasn't obnoxious, at least.

Cueing is as a voiceover in both workouts.  I find I have no trouble following it.  (Apparently there is a Spanish voiceover for the first workout, though since I do not speak Spanish, I did not bother to check this out.  But it is there if you want it.)  I like Ms. Caban as an instructor.  She provides clear instructions and isn't artificially peppy.  Her voice is easy to listen to.  I couldn't always see how she was holding the band with her hands, but in the introduction, she says you have several different options and demonstrates them, so I assume it doesn't matter how you hold the band in most instances.  (There are a couple of times where she gives specific directions.)

The main workout is different from the beginner workout (on her first DVD), although there are some familiar moves.  It is also different from a standard Pilates flow workout while incorporating some elements with new twists (I like wadding up the band between the heels for ""rolling like a ball,"" for example -- what a great way to make sure your feet stay together).  So this has definite value in terms of avoiding boredom.  The bonus workout has a lot of moves from the beginner workout, but mostly the ones I like from the arm and leg series so I am OK with that.  (Although I am not sure about keeping my toes curled for ""bird on a perch"" because the band kept coming off my feet when I tried to do that...)

This covers all areas of the body: core, legs, arms.  It has a fair amount of stretching as well as strengthening.  I actually did it after an hour-long cardio workout and it was an awesome cooldown.  (You may want to do a bit of cardio to warm up, actually.)  It's a different sort of strengthening from lifting weights but is great for variety and I did feel my muscles shaking some -- especially with some of the ab/core exercises.

I typically do Pilates once a week and switch up the workout every 2-3 weeks because I get bored.  I can see myself doing this one for a lot longer.

Please note: This workout originally came with a bodyband.  It is a heavy duty bodyband and is 6 feet long (and latex, so watch out if you have latex allergies).  If you are ordering this used, it may not include the band, and if it DOES include the band, you would want to check the condition carefully since it would probably be quite old and I have had these bands snap on me before.  You may want to get a different band anyway (since this is not the type of equipment I would really want to share with a stranger).  If so, do not get the current set of Gaiam bands as they are only 4 feet long and do not work with this exercise program.  (I learned the hard way.)  Get a flat, non-circular band that is at least 6 feet long (longer is OK).  There are several available on Amazon.",1458345600,,4241,4.220149253731344
8101849,4,B000CSTKKQ,"I find that I return to this DVD alot--since it's about 30-40 minutes I find that I can have the radio on, go through the poses and the time passes. It's not as tough as I would like, but still, it's good for stretching. I bought a ""hardest level"" stretchy band from an athletic store, so that helps make it more challenging.",1403049600,,325,4.258064516129032
8101850,1,B000CSTKKQ,"Body band was to stiff and had trouble getting it in the right position to get into each move.  At the end I don't even feel like I got a workout at all.  Disappointed with the one,  I would recommend her intermediate mat workout or her maintenance for weightloss dvds but pass on this.",1400457600,,286,4.2592592592592595
8101851,4,B000CSTKKQ,"I do Pilates DVDs a couple of times a week. The routine can get a bit dull, especially if you've been doing it for a few years or more. I was looking for a new DVD to switch things up and this one ended up being just what I needed. The body band adds difficulty to the exercises you already know, and Ana Caban brings in new strength-building exercises as well. There is less focus on developing your powerhouse/core compared to traditional Pilates, but I like the emphasis on building upper-body strength. The main workout is a little short at 30 minutes, but theres also a 20 minute bonus (which doesnt repeat the exercises from the first 30 minutes). With the exception of the lengthy stretching at the very beginning, the pace is good. This is not a beginner routine but it isn't too difficult either as you can adjust the difficulty of many of the movements using the body band.",1367366400,,883,4.490683229813665
8101852,5,B000CSTKKQ,"I think any pilates dvd by Ana Caban is an extraordinary workout.  I first acquired the basic pilates bodyband workout and enjoyed the pilates moves.  That specific dvd decreased inches off my waist, thighs, arms, butt & hips, in a matter of a couple of weeks so I decided to rotate both the basic & the challenge dvds.  Well, I couldn't be more pleased! The bodyband challenge starts off with relaxing stretches and gradually increases in difficulty with the hundred, the roll-up, leg circles, and the rowing series, etc.  I especially enjoyed the teaser variations, even though, it is incredibly hard to perfect the moves the same graceful way that Ana executes them.  This is an excellent intermediate-to- advanced workout plus the 20 minute bonus workout is also on the intermediate level.  When I do the workouts back to back, I feel especially worked out and relaxed at the same time.  Alternate your pilates workouts with yoga and cardio and be ready to be amazed at your fitness gains and body transformations.",1286928000,3,1018,4.883720930232558
8101853,3,B000CSTKKQ,"I purchased this DVD last week.  I have not done pilates on a regular basis and after a couple of tries, I've only been able to make it about 20 to 25 minutes through the DVD - it's really hard!  (Don't get me wrong, I know it needs to be tough for results - but this is REALLY HARD)  Additionally, I can barely hear Ana's instructions over the strange music.  I feel like I will stick with it for the time being, but so far I'm not finding it as enjoyable as I do my yoga DVD (Mandy Ingbar).  Bottom line - this is probably not the best DVD for first time pilates people and I believe Ana has a beginner's DVD.  Also, sound quality stinks.",1283990400,,640,4.0396825396825395
8101854,5,B000CSTKKQ,"I had started out with the beginners Pilates with the body band. After a few months, I didn't feel like I was getting the workout that I needed. I found this body band challenge, intermediate. I was nervous that it was going to be too hard for me, but found that while it is more difficult, I feel like I'm getting a good workout again. The bonus video is great for when you have a little more time and I just feel great after doing it all...have seen wonderful results!!",1265846400,,471,4.2444444444444445
8101855,1,B000CSTKKQ,"If you want to waste money on a DVD, buy this one. Her voice is the most irritating thing ever! As she does the workout, she never speaks.  The voice you hear in the video is a recording of her voice. She uses way too much girliness, squeakyness, and energy in her voice.  The work out is a low- impact excersize, she acts like your pushing 350 pound weights. She speaks like she's about to have an orgasm, it's the most irritating thing in the work. The work out is not challenging. This workout will not make you lose or maintain weight or sculpt your body.  It's false advertising in my opinion.

The band is very annoying. She basically substitues free weights for this band. If you are afraid of using 3-5 lb dumbells, buy this video. She basically, substitutes free weights using this purple band. If you are hurt and can't pick up 3-5 pound weights, buy this video. incorporate free weights in to your workout if you want to see results.

The reason I gave it a 1 star is because the band is great for stretching, if you want to get a good stretch, use this band. If I could, I would give it a 0 star.

If you want a workout to maintain weight or see results, this will not help you. You need much more than this video to sculpt your body.

I wish I could get a refund. Save your time and money.",1255564800,,1302,4.204819277108434
8101856,1,B000CSTKKQ,"I picked up this DVD for $5.00 at Marshalls with the intention of incorporating some of Ana's moves in my yoga and Pilates classes (I teach).  I loved most of her earlier DVDs; she can be inspiring as her passion for Pilates always shines through poor production qualities.  In this DVD she talked way too fast and rushed through the moves.  Key for Pilates is to do the move correctly-SLOW and controlled. She failed to adequately set up the moves-highly frustrating as all the shots were wide and I had no idea how she was holding the stretchy band.

If you want a really good intermediate Pilates DVD buy Golden Earth's Pilates Yoga Body Sculpting Ball Workout.",1244678400,7,664,4.64957264957265
8101857,5,B000CSTKKQ,Ana Caban does a great job of instructing in a motivating way. The workout really stretches and strengthens every muscle group. The extra resitance band builds muscle that much faster and you feel it the next day. Having had back/neck injuries I have to be careful what exercises I do and this DVD is great for doing supported/isolated strengthening exercises. The band gives support and resistance simulataneously and you can adapt it up or down as needed.,1233619200,,457,4.9480519480519485
