8291004,5,B001D25LSK,"Part 2 contains episodes 9-16 of ""Toward the Terra"" (""Terra e...""). It's a set of two regular DVD cases with one disc each kept together by a thin box cover. Part 3 contains 17-24 and part 1 contains 1-8. There is no English dub, since that is a big concern for people, but I enjoy both dubs and subs and honestly I don't think this series would dub well unless they got a really good writer for the job. The sub is fine. It's awkwardly worded, but it's not something that would be saved by a dub.

The middle of the series focuses more on the end of Keith's original arc and the Mu's time on Nazca. While the more interesting parts are found in part 1 and 3, a lot of important plot goes on in the segment, so don't miss out on it. There's an episode where Jomy re-encounters a brainwashed Sam and it's rather interesting. While this series is still ""X-Men in Space with Jean Grey clones"", this section focuses more on colonization and life inside the Mu community more than anything else. If you like ""Titan A.E."", you'll like this part a lot.",1393200000,,1045,4.304568527918781
8291005,5,B001D25LSK,"I have watched this entire series already and absolutely cannot recommend it enough. Do not let the ""retro"" style deceive you. I know many seem to turn away because this series is based on an old manga series, but don't let that get to you. You'll be missing out. Dismiss the nay-sayers and watch it for yourself.

If you are expecting explosions and action packed adventures every five seconds then this might not be the series for you. There is a lot of focus on the two main characters, Jomy and Keith, and their growth over time. It's about MU and their relationship with the rest of humanity and the computer system that seeks to destroy the Mu. This relationship is perfectly reflected in both Jomy (the Mu leader Soldier) and Keith (the perfect human that is supposed to lead humanity). There is action (this is a space opera of sorts afterall), but it's not the main point of the series.

Watch the whole series. You won't regret it.",1230336000,2,941,4.562130177514793
8291006,3,B001D25LSK,"Despite the promise this series showed in the beginning, the second act of `Toward The Terra' has long since run of fuel. Even with the dramatic cliffhanger that this set ends on, I find myself filled with little desire to see what happens next to the Mu. With a story that is barely being pushed along by its two leads, the supporting cast is forced to pick up the slack and there's only so much they can do. If you were waiting to see if `Toward The Terra' could keep up the momentum that it built up on set one, now you have your answer. Not recommended.",1229472000,,557,4.214953271028038
