8272175,4,B00196UB0S,"Includes only Wide version (1.85) of ""Man with One Red Shoe"" I could find.  I hate seeing body parts cut off in Full / 1:33 versions. Let me see it as if I was in the theater.  (Alright, I'm caught. I was too cheap to actually be there.  Let me pretend.)
Love ""That Thing You Do"" as well.  Great for the whole family.
One star off because I didn't want the R rated Bachelor Party.  Don't even want to spread it around by donating it to the library. Will probably trash it, altho  that makes me cringe because  I love dvds of good movies.",1416528000,3,537,4.105769230769231

8272181,3,B00196UB0S,"This 3 disc set contains the following films:

Disc 1: BACHELOR PARTY
Disc 2: THE MAN WITH ONE RED SHOE
Disc 3: THAT THING YOU DO!

All are in widescreen and feature Dolby Surround 5.1 audio.

Tom Hank's career can basically be divided into four parts:
A. When he was doing bit parts before ""Bosom Buddies"". e.g. he showed up for a few seconds in a scene in the TV series ""Taxi"".
B. After he became recognizable in ""Bosom Buddies"" but before he became a star in 1984's ""Splash"".
C. After ""Splash"" when he was doing largely inane comedies.
D. After he became the first back-to-back Best Actor Oscar winner since Spencer Tracy and entered into his highbrow era.

""Bachelor Party"" and ""The Man with One Red Shoe"" fit into time period C. These are basically B comedies from the 1980's in which Hanks is the best part of the film. Forget about the plot, it is basically just one gag after another. They are good films, but not great.

The third film is from the early part of time period D. 1996's ""That Thing You Do"" is a very good film, but Tom Hanks was mainly behind the camera, not so much in front of it. It is about a one-hit wonder band from the early-Beatles/Beach Boy era of American music and makes some points about how much life was changing during the mid 1960's as well as the fleeting nature of fame in the music business. There are comic moments in the film, but I wouldn't call it a comedy at all.",1221868800,35,1410,4.325757575757576
