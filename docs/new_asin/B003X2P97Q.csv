8407601,1,B003X2P97Q,"This is a very poorly made series of documentary. The focus is on the intent to downplay the importance of the founding fathers. We all know that every man has flaws, but the objective here is to describe them as people with a very low moral and character. In one of the DVDs we can even see (for minutes) interviews with ghost hunters (you read right!) in a paranormal investigation. Also we ""learn"" that the Declaration of Independence was put forward by a creature from another world! One of the ""historians"" even say that the founding fathers were ""stoned"" and were terrorists! Go online and look for these PhD.s historians that appear throughout the documentary to have an idea of the agenda they pursue: Marvin Kitman, Robert Hieronimus and David Eisenbach. Maybe this is a comedy documentary and I, as a Brazilian, cannot get the idea behind the language!!!! I think I should go to the US to get  a PhD because it must be so easy there!!!!Just check those ""historians"". You should not buy this product. I thought that the History channel would never go that low and now I am skeptic when  watching other productions from this channel.",1314662400,9,1141,4.7
8407602,4,B003X2P97Q,"A well done documentary done by a always good History Channel. It gives you a general view of
the founding of our nation.",1294444800,,121,4.304347826086956
