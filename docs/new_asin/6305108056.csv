972005,5,6305108056,"Old fashioned Euro horror absolutely dripping with wonderful Hammer-esque atmosphere.  The cheesy acting only help add to the bizarre happenings on screen.  There is a bit of titillation (no pun intended) thrown in just to  give it that extra euro-trashy flavour....but its the Templar Zombies that  rule...they are about as menacing and horrifying as Zombie's have ever  been.  Also outstanding is the haunting, chilling discordant soundtrack -  very influential on stuff like The Omen which followed a few years later.  The sequel on the flip side is a far weaker outing altogether.....now one  can only hope that Anchor Bay get their hands on the next installment of  Templar Terror.  This is a must for genre fans......Portugal/Spain's very  welcome contribution to the annals of Terror Movies. Epic Zombie stuff. The  transfer is a touch hazy as can be expected of such a low budget film and  one that is also fairly old.  One sometimes has the impression that Elite's  laser transfer was at least as good if not better.",949449600,5,1025,5.011904761904762
972006,4,6305108056,"Amando De Ossorio's eerie Spanish films finally make it to DVD! ""Tombs"" is presented on side one in the 1:66 ratio. It is subtitled in English. This is the definitive UNRATED version. There were  some rumors a few months back that this too was cut, but these are false;  this print has all of the scenes missing from the US and UK versions. The  picture quality is very good, although the elements they were working with  were less than perfect. These ""artifacts"" are especially  noticable during the opening credits. After that, the colors are vibrant  and the dark scenes even look decent! The sound is mono and passable.  There's also a total of twelve chapter stops throughout. Side two is where  ""Return of the Blind Dead"" starts. It too is uncut and presented  in the 1:66 ratio. The dialogue is dubbed into English. Again, very good  transfer throughout! The film elements appear to be of superior quality to  ""Tombs"". The mono track is adequate. Ten chapters total. What  more can I say? Oh yeah, it has a cool German poster printed on the back of  the chapter listings. I highly recommend this disc for fans of horror films  that could never have been made in the US!!",917136000,,1177,4.6231884057971016
972089,4,6305108056,"I have seen a few Spanish horror films in my day, such as ""The Blood Spattered Bride"", ""Day of the Beast"" and a couple of Paul Naschy werewolf films but none are as good as Amando De Ossorio's Blind Dead films.  In some ways these films are utterly laughable but they still hold up surprisingly well as some of the best Eurohorror of the 70's.  You can't go wrong with this disc, which combines the first two films of the series in a crystal clear transfer.  There are zippo extras here but who cares these two films are amazing.
""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" centers around two young women and one guy who set out on a campaign trip.  They take the train to go there but while on the train the three get into an argument and one of the girls named Virginia chooses to jump off the train (literally) at the midway point of their destination.  She finds herself in an abandoned city of ancient ruins.  Abandoned, that is, for the presence of the Blind Templars, cloaked horsemen who like to slice, dice and suck the blood out of their victims.  Meanwhile, the two other travellers decide to rent horses and explore the abandoned city in search of Virginia.  Big mistake.  The templars are waiting.
This is a supremely stylish and atmospheric film, one that relies on setting and sound to scare the bejeesus out of viewers.  The abandoned city is a really creepy place, replete with gothic architecture, walls burned to a crisp, every little sound made an echo of doom.  It's actually scarier sometimes when the templars are not there, for they appear supremely goofy when not on their horses, but that is part of this movie's charm.  I loved how we're given tons of backround story on the history of the templars, about 15 minutes worth of it.  They're mean now, but they were even worse as human beings believe it or not.
The second film is ""Return of the blind dead"".  A prologue shows us how the Templars originally died at the hands of the villagers.  The templars were conducting satanic sacrifices and rituals and once the villagers found out they burned them and poked their eyes out.  Fast forward 500 years later.  The village of Benzano is getting ready for ""Lakima"", a victory party celebrating the Templars' extinction 500 years ago.  The party is replete with champagne, dancing and fireworks.  The denizens however were not counting on the Templars crashing the party.  A massacre ensues and the few remaining survivors board themselves into a church as the Templars try to barge in, Night of the living dead style.
The second movie is equally good, although very different.  It sacrifices the atmosphere and style of the first movie for a faster pace and a much higher body count, not unusual for a sequel.  The templars are no longer mystical figures that only a select few would-be victims see, they are now on center stage for the entire populace to see.  An epic battle ensues, as the macho rednecks of the town pick up pitchforks and try to stab the Templars off their horses.  De Ossorio was obviously working with a much higher budget this time, especially given there's at least a hundred extras in this film.  As a whole film#2 is bloodier, campier and very different than film#1 but that's not a bad thing.  De Ossorio chose not to do the same movie twice and for that I respect him.",1088640000,,3303,4.593856655290103
972090,4,6305108056,"Zombie movies, what's not to like? This one is an underrated classic. Elegantly shot with some great lighting and camera angles. For my mind, the undead Templars, resurrected Occultist murderers who where put to death in real life, are the coolest zombies by far. Yes, even more so than Romero's blue people and Fulci's walking cadavers. Romero's zombies had traces of character. Fulci's zombies looked completely dead. But the Templars themselves have a mummy-like legend and effect. They're ancienct, and rise every night on their own accord. They ride zombie horses, hunt their prey by sound, did I mention they pack swords to make sure people don't get away? Yup, sword wielding zombie knights. Oh yeah, another fine touch; they are completely silent. No silly moaning or staggering around somewhat intoxicated for these bad boys. They stand almost with a prowess. These are the things we fear about most, the classic zombies in a true sense. The way they close in on their cowering victims before biting the hell out of them is pretty chilling.

972091,4,6305108056,"This DVD presents the first two of the popular Spanish BLIND DEAD horror series, in which the zombified bodies of Knights Templars, blinded and executed in the Middle Ages, rise up and seek revenge.  Both are presented in widescreen and appear to be the uncut versions, though the disc has no extras.
The first, TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD, is nicely atmospheric, and delivers the chills, with a little bit of gore, nudity, and lesbianism thrown in.  The second, RETURN OF THE BLIND DEAD (titled RETURN OF THE EVIL DEAD in the actual credits) goes for the action, with a bigger cast and a bit more gore and sadism.  Sure, they're a bit cheesy and slow at times, but you can have fun counting the movie cliches riddled throughout.

972092,5,6305108056,"These films have a bad premise, but are great Spanish Horror films from the 70's. The premise; blind, dead, zombie Templars awake and attack anyone available. Classic in the slow moving aspect, the constructed Templars are in fact, blind, so that means they can't see you. They can hear, however, and if your prone to screaming, whining, breathing heavy or dropping things, they are a detriment to good health.
Templar bashing aside, the design of the zombies is very eerie, and they come off as approaching frightening the longer you watch.  Even for there time, there are elements of horror and shock.  Reminescent of italian directors Bava and Argento, these will delight fans of Euro-Horror.  Essentially along the same lines as ""Night of the Living Dead"" but with frank supernatural qualities, there were four films made in this series, the other two unreleased on DVD; ""Horror of the Zombies"" and ""Night of the Death Cult"" (released under various names). Lots of unintentional camp, these films are classic in the zombie genre, and a must own for fans.

972093,4,6305108056,"""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" is the better of the two films contained on this dvd.
However, the second movie, in it's absurdity is still fun to watch.
Both films revolve around Templar Knights, who sold their souls to the devil, in return for eternal life.
Apparently, at one point, if I remember correctly crows ate their eyes, which is why they are 'the blind dead.'
(They'd been sacrificing the village virgins, got caught and were punished....only to return from the grave.)
They can't see their victims, but, they can hear you...even the beating of your heart.
Overall, the films have a great 'atmosphere' to them...fog, eerie chanting/music and the zombies themselves are rather well done.
None of the films are high in the 'gore-level', as far as most european zombie 'splat-fests' go, but, if you are are horror fan, that enjoys ALL types of horror, you should enjoy them.
Also, if you manage to track down a copy of a film called ""Horror of the Zombies"", it ties in with these two films...only the zombies are at sea.",1041292800,,1023,4.720670391061453

But, I must admit,that this is one of the best film to DVD transfers I have ever seen. Extreme crispness and great sound clarity.

972095,5,6305108056,"De Ossorio's masterpiece! Along with Naschy's werewolf movies, the Blind Dead films are the best that Spanish horror has to offer. These films have everything you could possibly want from Euro exploitation--zombies, lesbians, flesh-eating, nudity (did I mention there're lesbians?), and, of course, the Blind Dead their own bad selves.
The plot concerns the Knights Templar, executed for withcraft and their eyes plucked by ravens, raising from the dead and doing the kind of stuff you've come to expect from satanic flesh-eating zombies. What sets these skeletal dead-heads apart from the legions of walking dead that have come before and since is that they carry swords, wear monk robes, ride horses, and have no eyes (duh). They find their prey by sound alone, and then it's hell to pay, baby!!!!
This movie is lots and lots of fun. Too bad the other two films in the series aren't on DVD. A cut version of the 3rd film used to be available on video as Horror of the Zombies and can sometimes be found in bigger video stores--just be prepared to blow dust off the box. You might even find the fourth film, the great Night Of the Seagulls, uncut, under the title Mark Of The Devil 3. Good luck!!!
And if you REALLY like this movie, the heavy metal band Cathederal has a song on one of their discs called ""Night Of The Seagulls"" about none other than our friends the Blind Dead. ""We are the Blind Dead, we have no eyes inside our head...""
If you REALLY, REALLY dig this freaky movie, check out Michael Soavi's film The Church to see more zombie versions of the Knights Templar (though with their eyes).",1000771200,24,1603,4.667844522968198

Now, many moons later, I can see a few problems that I otherwise  wouldn't have picked up on. For starters, it is presented in Spanish with  English sub-titles, which I presume to be its original language, but the  lip-sync STILL doesn't match. What's up with that?
The movie on the  ""B-side"" of this disk is really lame, and the background plot  doesn't match. In ""Tombs,"" the Templar Knights are hung, and the  crows peck out their eyes.
On the ""B-side"" movie, an angry mob  burns their eyes out with torches. Which is it?
I personally like the  first one better. The chick who plays Virginia is hot, and the writing AND  the acting is much better.

It's been years since I've watched this version of these movies, and I'm only posting to caution shoppers looking for a two-for-one deal.  In short, you're better off spending an extra few dollars to buy the Blue Underground releases of the individual movies.  You'll get a sharper transfer and an option to watch the original Spanish version of ""Tombs,"" which is vastly superior to the American cut provided here.

As for the movies themselves, individual mileage will vary.  They're definitely sleazy, with some amateurish writing and production elements and a streak of brutal misogyny, all typical of European horror from the 70s.  They also have moments of genuine creepiness and startling violence, and a tight enough pace to make them worth at least a viewing or two.

7883728,4,6305108056,"This DVD offers up ""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" (""La Noche del terror ciego"") and ""Return of the Blind Dead"" (""El ataque de los muertos sin ojos""), which comprise the first half of writer-director Amando de Ossorio's four-part horror masterpiece about the undead Templar Knights that emerge from their tombs and move ever so slowly after their victims.  When you watch these films you might be reminded of Richard Pryor's joke about how the mummy is coming so, ""Walk away!  Walk away!""  But Ossorio knows how to work the atmosphere with his creations despite being handicapped by having neither the time nor the money to make better movies.

""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" begins 500 years ago when the Templars were sacrificing virgins and drinking their blood.  Eventually the locals attacked the Templars, burning out the eyes of the knights before burning them at the stake.  Ever since then no one goes near their castle, that is until Virginia White (Mara Elena Arpn) hops off a train in the middle of nowhere and ends up spending the night there.  That night the Templar knights, skeletal corpses dressed up in armor, rise (slowly) from their tombs and follow the sounds of Virginia's screams.  The trick is to stay silent so the blind Templars cannot hear where you are, but it is difficult to stay quiet when these things are after you.  When Virginia's dead body is found her friends Betty Turner (Lone Fleming) and Roger Whelan (Csar Burner) decide to find out what happened to her.  This is where they learn the legend of the Templars and then go off to investigate the castle, thinking that maybe somebody is using the local tale as a cover for criminal activity.  This explains why they drag along local smuggler Pedro Candal (Joseph Thelman) and his girlfriend Maria (Mara Silva), to investigate the place, which only gives the Templars more victims to pursue (slowly).

Ossorio is all about atmosphere, so what stands out here is the thought of these shuffling corpses coming after you while the young women who are about to die take terms trying not to make a sound and then screaming all the way until the end.  There is usually some blood at the end, but ""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" is more about spooky atmosphere.  You just have to remind yourself that this film was made in 1971 and not judge its slower pace by the standard of contemporary horror films.  Actually, this is the 86 minute dubbed into English version of the original 101 minute Spanish film.  What has been cut from ""La Noche del terror ciego"" is the nudity, a rather chaste lesbian love scene, the bloodier parts of the flashback, and one of the more gratuitous rape scenes of all-time.  The edited flashback is actually the prologue for ""Tombs of the Blind Dead.""

The most interesting thing about ""Return of the Evil Dead"" is that while it is a sequel it stands on its own.  That is because it seems the rules of the game have changed somewhat, although they are certainly still compatible.  This second film begins with what happened to the Templars in 1473 when the local villagers got tired ot the knights sacrificing virgins and drinking their blood.  Now it is the 500th anniversary of when the Templars were burned at the stake and the villagers are celebrating their victory, including burning Templar manikins at the stake.  Barricading themselves inside a hacienda are a small group of people trying to survive, including Jack Marlowe (Tony Kendall), who showed up in town to provide fireworks for the celebration, his old girl friend Vivian (Esther Roy), and the corrupt mayor (Fernando Sancho).  The mayor keeps calling the governor for help, but the governor's mistress keeps telling him that everybody in the town is drunk because of the big celebration, so they are on their own.

Consequently, this 1973 film ends up being a lot like ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" where you have people holed up someplace surrounded by a bunch of slow moving monsters (Ossorio dismisses the comparison because it is a commonplace of horror films).  In this dubbed English version the Templars simply rise from their tombs, get on their horses, ride into town, and start slaughtering the locals.  However, if you see the slightly longer original version, ""El ataque de los muertos sin ojos,"" there is a scene where Murdo (Jos Canalejas), the creepy looking guy in town, makes a blood offering to raise the Templars from the dead (and this time there are easily twice as many as in the first film).  I found this to be the best of the four films and while none of them are great, they are pretty good when it comes to taking the relatively simple idea of the blind undead Templar knights and then creating and sustaining a spooky atmosphere on a shoestring budget.

Be aware that there is a new 5-DVD set with all four ""Blind Dead"" films plus a disc that has a brief documentary about Ossorio and some rare interview clips, was released this month.  The advantage of the set over this one DVD is that you get both the dubbed English versions and the original Spanish versions of both ""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" and ""Return of the Blind Dead,"" with the latter being preferred, even if you have to read the subtitles.  These were followed by ""El buque maldito"" (""The Ghost Galleon"") in 1974, and ""La Noche de las gavitos"" (""Night of the Seagulls"") in 1975.  Some see Jesus Franco's 1985 film ""La Mansin de los muertos vivientes"" as a remake of Ossorio's first film, but I think you are on safer ground if you consider it to be definitely inspired by this entire series.  One of the interesting things about the series is that most of the films can stand on their own, with the second being the best of the lot.",1130544000,4,5685,4.688128772635815
7883729,2,6305108056,"As a young teen, I would often see photo's of this cult 1971 Spanish film in books on horror cinema. Usually, the still showed two of the ""Blind Dead"" returned from the grave with their mouldering cloaks and skull like features, obviously pursuing their hapless victims. So, sight unseen I purchased the DVD and greeted it's arrival with some anticipation !

Now I love low budget Eurotrash, horror cinema....but ""Tombs"" is unbearably slow, has plot holes bigger than Texas, and virtually no thrills or chills.

The film opens with the blood thirtsty Knights Templar sacrificing some poor virgin during the Middle Ages. Tied to a cross, they whip her naked body until she bleeds profusely and then feast upon her still warm blood...although it's actually a bunch of guys licking tomato ketchup off what is obviously a shop mannequin. After the opening credits roll over shots of an abandoned castle, we see a withered hand, some dishevelled woman screams into the camera and then bang (!), we are suddenly at a hotel pool in modern day Lisbon ? ( Did I miss something ? )

Now follow this....two female school friends (Betty & Virginia) who obviously haven't seen each other in a while, become reacquainted poolside, and Betty's friend Roger hops out of the water, and instantly suggests Virginia join them tomorrow on a camping trip ! The next day our happy trio all meet at the train station ( no visible luggage for said camping trip ) and board what looks like one of those half size trains with two carraiges that you see at second class amusement parks. Five minutes into the trip on the toy train, its revealed that Betty and Virginia had a lesbian embrace as teenagers ( although it was about as passionate as a cold rice judging from the silly flasback ). Virginia gets all moody ( possibly because Betty is no longer butch ? ) and jumps off the train ( as you do ) and heads off to the nearest haunted castle for the night. After Virginia titillates the audience by disrobing in front of the fire, she beds down for the night only to be awoken by those pesky Blind Dead zombies (riding Blind Dead Horses too !), who insist on making a meal out of her !

( And if you think Romero's living dead shuffle around slowly, then De Ossorio's blind dead would have trouble outpacing a three legged turtle over a ten yard dash ! )

Naive Virginia turns up dead, Roger and Betty stumble across the ruins of the graveyard of the Knights Templar, and two Spanish cops invite Roger and Betty to view Virginia's cannibalised corpse ( aided by some grinning, weirdo morgue attendant )

Roger seeks professional advice on the Knights Templar from a university professor with Coke bottle thick glasses, until they are rudely interrupted by the police inspector who tells the professor that his missing son is the local bandit leader in the village right next to the spooky castle ( I think this is a plot twist from ""Days Of Our Lives ? ) So, Roger enlists the aid of virile bandit Pedro (and his cheap date) and Betty joins them all at Castle Creepy, thus they can all sit around at midnight and await the Blind Dead. Meanwhile, back at the morgue, Virginia rises from the dead and munches on the nutty morgue attendant, before heading off to a mannequin factory, terrorising the staff before perishing herself for the second time in a very fake looking fire ! We cut back to the haunted castle and Pedro has gotten bored and restless ( just like I am watching this absurd film ), and so he wanders off with Betty and proceeds to rape her ( he'll pay for that ), whilst Roger thinks Pedro's woman is pretty hot and they too are soon lip locked.

The bells toll midnight and poor Pedro finds himself surrounded by rising dead with nothing more than a blunt switchblade. Without so much as a punch thrown, Pedro goes down and becomes the next meal ( it's strange how the close ups of the Blind Dead munching on Pedro look like hand puppets of withered monkey heads drooling ketchup ? ).

Distressed Roger and Pedro's scantily clad floozy go down screaming and fall prey to the monkey hand puppets, before Betty escapes and flags down the toy train. However, the Blind Dead quickly demonstrate they are just not limited to horse theft, murder and deflowering virgins....and they too board the train without valid tickets (!) and proceed to ""knight"" everyone on board with sword blows to the head.

The choo-choo train takes off, arrives at the next station full of butchered Spaniards, as Betty screams in horror, and a mummified hand is shown on a slab of marble (?). My summary....A very dis-jointed, poorly acted and unscary horror tale that barely kept me awake for its 89 minute running time. I'm giving this film two stars (instead of one) because at least the Blind Dead's decaying cloaks & features are quite haunting and gothicly atmospheric. However, for my money there are plenty of scarier and sexier Eurotrash horror movies around ( such as Jean Rollins ""Lips of Blood"" or Jimmy Sangsters ""Lust For a Vampire"" ), rather than this Spanish zombie mish mash !",1109980800,8,5060,4.625835189309577
7883730,3,6305108056,"I caught TOTBD on Elvira's Movie Macabre back in the day and have loved it ever since.  That should be all you need to know to understand how cheese-y the movie is (for you younger folks, this is the kind of movie you'd see lambasted on Mystery Science Theater 3000).  Of course, it's tasty cheese and it has aged rather well.

The quality of this DVD presentation is very good; however, after paying around $30 when it first came out, I have seen this DVD offered much cheaper at brick and mortar locations in recent years.  If you can't find a cheaper copy locally and absolutely must have one, I guess you'll have to bite the bullet and order here.

The movies hinge on the Knights Templar, who were actual, historical figures & the original proponents of the (European) War on Terror.  Though they lost many battles throughout the Crusades, the Templars became so wealthy & consequently so powerful that they began to challenge the rule & authority of European monarchs.  The monarchs eventually conspired against the Templars, charging them with heresy.  Templar leaders were prosecuted & subsequently executed, causing the organization's dissolution.  Though the heresy charges were largely false concoctions, the sordid allegations make for a much more interesting premise on which to build a horror movie.

To his credit, de Ossorio's decision to exploit the more diabolical aspects of Templar mythology pays off.  The overall concept is brilliant, though it just begs to be remade with more money and better effects. The coolest, most unique features of TOTBD are the genuine, on-location castle ruins & the eerily undead Templars riding horseback in slo-mo. Conversely, it's most annoying & inexplicable how apparently in Spain day turns to night in a matter of about fifteen seconds and yet the dead of night looks just like noon! Watch it; you'll understand what I mean.

The movie has creep factor galore (one creep in particular being a leacherous, necrophile mortician's assistant), but few genuine scares. It's also subtitled, as I recall, so be warned.

Sadly, ROTBD is much less effective.  Forsaking the castle ruins, the Blind Templars instead attack a neighboring village.  The less creepy environs make for a less creepy movie.  Still, if you're a fan of B horror movies (and why wouldn't you be?) this double feature is a great way to spend an evening.
