1658663,5,B00005RZS7,"Bourne is one of my favorite choreographers.  Here, by means of a verbal pun (Carmen; Car Man) he creates a steamy universe firmly anchored in Hollywood's sexy ""film noirs"" such as ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" or ""The Postman Does not Ring Twice""-- with male desire leading the plot.  Dancers, staging, music, choreography, all magnificent.  I have now everythig of his I've been able to find.  Complete your collection with ""Swan Lake"" and ""The Nutcracker""!",1223769600,,456,5.121621621621622
1658664,5,B00005RZS7,"Matthew Bourne takes one of the most performed, most beloved (and cliched) operas and turns it in to a dynamic modern dance tour de force.  Transforming the story from 19th century Spain to mid-20th century America brilliantly invigorates the story with new life.  Adding cinematic touches of film noir and Alfred Hitchcock add suspense. Turning the traditional love triangle into a bisexual one further activates the plot.  The quick cutting and constant camera movement, while supporting the suspense/film noir aspects,  mar the superb dancing.  When filmming dance the camera should hold on long shots that show the bodies and feet of the dancers.  Perhaps more split screen or picture in picture could have been used innovatively to show both the dancers faces in close up and still maintain the view of the dance.

Perhaps this DVD is too cinematic for hardcore dance aficionadoes, but for most people who love musicals, this is another wonderful work by Matthew Bourne.",1169769600,4,975,5.132911392405063
1658665,5,B00005RZS7,"I agree with some of the previous reviewers:  this is Matthew Bourne at his best: he's a genius of a story-teller and choreographer.  His Swan Lake has become a top notch variation on a classic ballet and his recent Nutcracker is bound to become the same. For those of us who have no chance of ever seeing this production staged in a theater, this DVD is not to be missed. I find watching it arousing (in the full meaning of the word), emotionally shattering, and ultimately cleansing in the manner of a classic tragedy.

I agree with others of the previous reviewers: the nervous, MTV style camera work distracts from the dancing and the overall composition of this brilliant theater piece.  In his commentary Bourne offers a sort of reasoning for the hyperactive cutting back and forth but it comes across as an after-the-fact attempt to save the integrity of his own work.  There are indeed too many close-ups that prevent the viewer from seeing the dancers dance, and just as the eye settles on a movement the camera shifts.  BUT I found that on second viewing I could watch sections of the DVD in slow motion without the sound track and could see and appreciate a lot more of Bourne's remarkable sense of pattern and movement and the terrific discipline and energy of the dancers.

I give this DVD five stars because this is the only version I am ever likely to see and even with its directorial flaws it conveys the high artistry and erotic energy of not only Bourne's reworking of Bizet's Carmen but also the essence of the original opera.

I think Bourne's work has staying power and that we will treasure his productions over the years, above all perhaps the magnificent Swan Lake.  But where is the DVD of his Cinderella set in WWII London?",1135468800,7,1750,4.619354838709677
1658666,4,B00005RZS7,"This is NOT your traditional ballet. It is, however, gripping and entrancing. The dancers are good, and the choreography imaginative. Our attention never wandered.

The plot of this ""auto-erotic"" dance thriller is not totally linear, but it is clearly drawn. We are interested in the characters and their interactions. We find considerable beauty as well.

My only quarrel with this presentation is the rapid cutting. I wish the camera had been able to linger longer without all the constant motion.",1113955200,12,499,5.225
1658667,1,B00005RZS7,"If you want to see Matthew Bourne's choreography, your in for a major disappointment. The constant pseudo-artsy cutting, jarring close-ups, and poor shots of the dancing make this a jarring and extremely disappointing video. Be warned if you have epilepsy. The fast continuous scene switching will probably induce an episode.",1102118400,6,325,5.52
1658668,1,B00005RZS7,"This is a terribly disappointing video. I was expecting to see some incredible dancing. Instead, what we have throughout this recording, are close-ups of head and shoulders and a few seconds of group/long shots.  I actually started counting the seconds a camera held a position and the longest length of time was 8 seconds - and that's including the lyrical passages. The group is passionate and attractive. The costumes and sets are terrific. If only the cameras could stay still. I'm sure this performance was thrilling in the theater. Major dissapointment.",1094688000,12,559,5.142857142857143
1658669,4,B00005RZS7,"I hadn't seen Bourne's ""Swan Lake"" nor knew anything of it before seeing ""Car Man,"" so I had no expectations.

And because of that, I found myself either gasping or holding my breath at times.  I love modern dance, and was not disappointed.  The sensuality and steaminess within the dance only hightened my reaction towards this show.  The story is simple to say the least... but then, it's based on a simple opera.  This is a dynamite show and definitely worth the attention.

(Please note:  The review above is for that of the play.  I have not seen the actual video noted here.  Others' negative critiques may very well be agreeable.)",1054425600,11,637,4.666666666666667
1658670,2,B00005RZS7,"I found Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake to be fascinating and exciting, thanks in large part to Adam Cooper's thrilling work as the Swan. So, I very much looked forward to this DVD of his subsequent work, The Car Man. Athletic dancing to music from ""Carmen"" -- what could be better?

But instead of enjoying it, I caught myself looking at my watch after 20 minutes (the work is 87 minutes long). The choreography is much less inspired here. Or at least, the choppy editing evident on the DVD makes it seem so.

The plot is pretty hokey and predictable -- despite Bourne's references, in the bonus interview on the DVD, to ""surprises"" throughout and borrowings from Hitchcock. When you're viewing a Bourne production, the fact that a character is bisexual is not a surprise.

It's obvious as you watch The Car Man that it's a British man's view of small-town America in 1960. Although Bourne seems to indicate in his interview that the setting is an Italian-American community, there's little here to indicate that. And the mid-section's nightclub setting with its mystery lady seems entirely out of place -- it does little to advance the slender plot.

The performers, who are all playing cliched roles, give it their all and are perhaps even more persuasive in their acting than in their dancing (because Bourne didn't give them much to work with).

I'd recommend this to fervent Bourne fans only.",1053043200,12,1393,4.811715481171548
7953200,5,B00005RZS7,"Another stunner from Matthew Bourne,  Sexy, bloody, violent - and mesmerizing.  There were a few things I hope the new version (from a 2015 performance and just released) will change, since Bourne likes to tinker with his works, but although I often wanted to look away I couldn't, and the second act, as the events of the first act come to a head, is just wonderful - heart-breaking, suspenseful, and explosive.  At the end, all I could do was breathe out a stunned ""Wow, that was wonderful!"".",1514160000,,494,4.655172413793103

7953205,5,B00005RZS7,"And if you do you don't need me to tell you how are incredible he is as storyteller and choreographer. There are two things I find unique to Bournes ballets. One is all the humorous touches he scatters through them and the other is how all his lifts are so seamlessly inserted into the ongoing movements. I have always noticed how male dancers generally spend considerable time periods just posing, waiting to lift, catch or throw the ballerina. Only twice in four ballets did I ever see a dancer prepare for a lift. The rest of the time the lift was seamlessly interwoven in the the dancers movements. You never saw it coming! His dancers are as good as actors as they are as dancers. And believe me that is very good! Matthew Bourne is a genius and I am frustratingly waiting for another of his works to come out on dvd so I can immediately buy it.",1401235200,,850,4.386075949367089

7953207,5,B00005RZS7,"Traditional Ballet does not 'speak' to me, but this great work by Matthew Bourne, while respecting
the past, models a ballet to speak to a new time.  I love the work of Matthew Bourne and all those
individuals that helped in the creation of 'The Car Man'.",1353369600,,255,4.425531914893617
7953208,3,B00005RZS7,"This adaptation of the Carmen story will appeal to people who like dirty dancing and explicit violence (think of a tongue-in-cheek noir version of West Side Story, without the singing).  That said, it is an interesting example of studio dancing. But after a while, the red-hot passion becomes exhausting.  When the anti-hero is finally killed at the end, one cannot help but wonder if it was a relief to him to be out of it.",1271635200,,424,4.64
7953209,5,B00005RZS7,"Matthew Bourne's Car Man is a simply brilliant redo of the classic opera of the (more or less) same name.  The wonderful music is all there, the plot shifted to a western US auto repair shop (from cigars to auto parts, hmmm), and as with all ballet, no spoken dialogue. But I found it simply wonderful to watch, the dancers erotic without a doubt but in a highly entertaining way.  If you like the music, or if you like dance, and especially if you like both, give this a try.....",1237334400,,480,4.322222222222222
