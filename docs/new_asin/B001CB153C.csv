3506961,3,B001CB153C,"This video primarily deals with, or should I say wages war against, herbal medicine. But there are criticisms of conspiracy theories, and some New Age practices and ideas. It is all made in light of listing logical fallacies, and their examples.

ok. while many of us today live strictly by naturalistic worldview, there are some areas of knowledge that is best explain non-naturalisticly.

Some major points worth knowing:

1.) I agree that there are some charlatans among psychics, and I agree that some of the products for losing wight are hoaxes too, but making a generalizations to include all psychics and all supplements (like fish oil, and Noni juice, St. Johns Wort) into mythological is too much for me. For example, psychic MAY communicating with a spirit. Why not? Only naturalism can rule that out, and pretty much only by a priory premise about the world.

2.) In addition, there are reasons to believe that pharmaceutical companies care more about money then health sometimes.

3.) when he says that news ""report without critique"", he means news report without naturalistic glasses.

4.) labeling something as 'pseudo-science' like measuring ghosts with electronic devices may be pseudo-scientific. true. But why suppressing the evidence? I watched some videos on TV precisely about that, and they had several weird stuff happen, like recording pretty clear voice, or something of this sort. Whatever the case, I am not advocating anything, I just want conclusions speak for themselves instead of labeling something as 'pseudo-scientific' A PRIORI, because one happens to belong to naturalistic camp. As the matter of fact some of those thing that are labeled 'pseudo-scientific' may turn out to be arguments against naturalistic view.

5.) I never heard of an 'mystical energy' fallacy. Author says that positive/negative energy expressions are 'meaningless nonsense'. I don't believe in these energies too, but this is more an issue of one's wordview, nor of an logical reasoning. (for pantheist these may be meaningful, and to argue against takes more than label them 'logical fallacy'. It takes debunking entire pantheistic worldview.) He gives his [naturalistic - empiricist's] definition of energy, but for pantheist this definition may not work. So, what is the point of defining what 'energy' is, when the meaning is not equivocal for two separate worldviews? It may sound the same, but the meaning attached may be different. 'measurable work capability' is definition author provides, but if I were to ask Hindu or Buddhist they would give THEIR definition, if any definition at all. I think author confuses the listener instead of clarifying that there are at least TWO ways of looking at the same word 'energy'. It is not that I agree that there is this pantheistic energy or not, I just acknowledge the fact that THEY mean it to be different thing. If author's advice is followed on this one, it only leads to confusion.

Some quotes I don't like:
a) Author said: ""...All I did was pointing out that these ideas are not supported by any evidence. They have no rational, scientific hypotheses behind them and no experimental data indicating that they work"". But this is question begging of what is to be considered as evidence.
b) Also, ""...good science presents good data"". Yes... but.. there are more variables involved in, for example, drug testing. Statistics, may play tricks and often, if not always, specific medicine is not 100% working, and as you know has side effects. It's just more complicated than seems. You probably can recall drugs being called out from the market. So, it's not as miraculous as it wished to be.
c) ""It is completely illogical and backwards to think that the ancients had a better understanding of anything than moder science"". Well, may or may not be... Ancient did not had Walgreen's to go for medicine, so they used natural means. It doesn't mean that I believe in everything is being sold, but ruling something out A PRIORI, based on some questionable assumption that we are smarter is not the best way I think. Ancients could build things without computers and electricity so precise, that moderns are still fascinated. I would not say it is 'illogical', as author says, I would investigate first. I hate A PRIORI assumptions, especially if it is based on ideological presuppositions [like that of an author's, which seems to be methodological naturalism].

d) ""Red herrings are favorite among conspiracy theorists. If you listen to the people who try to convince us that September 11th was perpetrated by our own government, their evidence consists of virtually nothing but red herrings"". - well to my knowledge, they point to WT7, which wasn't been hit by plane but was ""pulled down"". The point here, is not to convict or not about conspiracy, but to say that conspiracy theories are not red herrings as author says. At least not 'virtually nothing but' as author says.

e) ""...science never surpasses good science"". Well this may be disputed in light of history of science. While generally, may or may not be true, there was paradigm shifts in the past. [from the flat earth to the round earth]And, today it also may happen if the Intelligent Design Theory is true.

f) under Ideological Support he says: ""...generally when a theory is scientifically sound, even if it's brand new, it will eventually find its way into educational curriculum. Good science is done in the lab. Not in the courts. Not in protest marches. Not in blogs, and not on Oprah"". This is somewhat true, but rather naive. It is pretty true when come to TESTABLE, REPEATABLE events, but when it comes to something more 'not so obvious to the eye' as round earth, existance of electrons, or Intelligent Design, it takes more than just testing in the lab with naked eyes, because earth is to huge to test it in the lab :D , electrons are so tiny one needs powerful lenses,and evolution [with common descent, etc] is the hypotheses of the PAST.

g) ""Take a stand when your community considers the question 'should education and the media be balanced?' Isn't it fair and better to show both sides? Aren't free speech and academic freedom of paramount importance? Well, that depends. In matters of opinion or philosophy, where academic freedom applies - yes. In matters of science - absolutely not."" It would sound great if (again) not the fact that things are not as simple as author wants them to be. Obviously, opinion is not very substantial. But how do we proceed with ethics for example? It is not ""SCIENCE""! This advice is rather naive. I'm honestly think so. Not that it sound bad, but because it is so vague, that it means so little. There is more to science that it seems. Science too has its philosophy. And observation and archeology require interpretation. Fossils can't talk. It is scientists who interpret what they dig out from the ground who interpret what they have. It is a part of a monkey or is it of a man, or is it a tooth of a pig, who some 'scientist' drew in paper as a tooth of a human? (which actually happened). You see, people tend to reinterpret things in light of their already formed presuppositions and ideas. It is not as simple thing as author wants it to be. In addition, don't forget that there IS disagreement among scientists too. Of course not on simple things like 2+2 or H2O, but in reality on more complex theories or methods. (Especially in light of what author said regarding the fact that scientific theories constantly change !!! If they change which scientist are we to listen to?)
Science deals with various questions, and some of them lie in the area of repeated and testable events, and some not. Forensics, for example do not repeat (I hope)crimes, they investigate them. However, sometimes people won't admit the distinction between these two areas. This is often happens in evolution/anti-evolution debate. First, macro-evolution is more philosophical than scientific theory. Especially when one recognizes that it proceeds from methodological naturalist who CANNOT by definition of his position accept anything supernatural. Not that it is impossible in theory, but because it is impossible for him under his set of philosophical postulates about the reality. And for this reason he WANTS to drag macro-evolution from forensic science into repeatable science, while it is impossible. Second, whether or not supernatural event can or do happen is not science, it is more like philosophy OF science. And yes, today there is a trend to drag astrology to the same level as say cardiology. This is sound ridiculous. But naturalism is ridiculous too, but it lies on the other side of the spectrum.

Author did acceptable job pointing out most common logical fallacies, even though he SHOULD include MORE, instead of elaborating these in more detail, while sometimes presenting them poorly.

P.S. I did not pay to watch it. So, if I were to pay 15 bucks, I would likely to buy a more detailed book instead. (probably by other author)",1215907200,3,9015,4.945838837516512

There. The negativs are out of the way.

I've enjoyed listening to Brian's Skeptoid podcast, and I enjoyed this 40-minute video as it was meant to be consumed: as an introduction (with examples) of a particular approach to rational thought. The author does make some unsubstantiated claims about the examples he uses, but never about the subject matter itself - critical thinking.

Since common sense is not very common, and since too few people practice critical thinking today, this short video is true to its purpose: to call people to a higher level of thought. I highly encourage teachers to show the video to their students - of any age.",1219190400,,755,4.704545454545454

Brian Dunning makes an accessible introduction to critical thinking and makes one realise that the people who accuse scientists and their methodology of being narrow-minded, that indeed it is the purveyors of all this ""energy"", crystal healing, vitamin supplements and so on who are closed minded as they will not allow themselves to have their beliefs tested using scientific methodologies that challenge the world around us.

3506967,5,B001CB153C,"""Here Be Dragons""--an approximately forty-minute-long film by Brian Dunning, creator of the excellent skeptically minded podcast ""Skeptoid""--serves as an excellent introduction, primer, or refresher course for anyone interested in viewing the world through a crystalline lens--for anyone interested in thinking about things clearly.

The film covers much of the same ground that Dunning's Skeptoid podcast does, but does so in an introductory way that will serve as a terrific introduction to critical thinking for all those unfamiliar with it.  It stays away from most truly controversial topics, such as religion, and by doing so remains accessible to anyone, although never shying from discussing what is logical and sane, and what is rational and real.

It really is great.  It's funny, it's on target, and it's the sort of thing you can give to all those people in your life who insist on viewing the world as a realm in which the superstitious and pseudoscientific is real.  Plus, even long-time skeptics will find something new here--because there is a incredible amount to be discovered here--or they'll at least find themselves reminded of something that they had forgotten or neglected.  I know I did.

The film features a good overview of logical fallacies, of popular myths and misconceptions, and of common ways our thinking can go wrong.  I think it would also be excellent to show in philosophy, psychology, and science classes.  Highly, highly recommended.",1216684800,2,1472,5.283261802575107

The best thing about it, other than the solid science material it contains, is that it's completely appropriate for any age group and not likely to offend anybody--unless they have adopted one of the questionable beliefs or practices that Dunning attacks.

But those attacks aren't the point anyway.  He only uses them as examples of how to use critical thinking to evaluate claims when you haven't seen them before and don't know what to make of them.  Thinking for yourself, and not allowing people to fool you for their own gain, is the point, and Dunning makes that point in a simple and compelling way.

This video gets my highest recommendation based on the content.  Even so, I have to say that some people might find Dunning's presentation skills just a tad on the dry side.  I know I did.  He's no Mythbuster, and he's no Bill Nye the Science Guy, but I know that a lot of people will find that kind of flash-free earnestness refreshing.",1215993600,7,1209,4.797101449275362

8286421,1,B001CB153C,"I bought this DVD to use as part of a critical thinking lecture and will probably throw it away. Critical thinking is first and foremost a method of careful inquiry. It is important to note which questions are pertinent and weigh the answers carefully. It is not simply an attack designed to discredit as is so often portrayed in the media. The idea is to arrive at truth, regardless of who it best serves.

While he does touch on crtical thinking, he does so by making huge negative generalizations about health food products, new age beliefs and belief in ghosts and the paranormal. In doing so he is guilty of violating many of the basic principles he claims to be advocating. As I listened to him I found one falicy after another in his reasoning.

Other than the above tendency to make huge generalizations while defending without question the honesty of our government and pharmacuetical companies to name a few, he spent much of this DVD coasting down a very slippery slope as he hand picked examples, most of which weren't terribly convincing. He also repeatedly over-extended his premise, insinuating that by debunking one kind of product or belief, his logic applies to other similar products or beliefs. While he rails against products which are not medically sanctioned he shows video of many products that do have value, like fish oil and organic products.

When it comes to the paranormal, he spends quite a bit of time debunking stories of people who alledge near or after death contact from loved ones. He reduces these kind of encounters to an equation based on the likelihood of thinking of someone around the time of their death. But what about the content of these visits?? This reduction assumes that all of the encounters (imagined or otherwise) contained normal thoughts about the loved one that might have occured randomly. He ignores content completely.

Even when I agreed with him that a question was valid, I felt his analysis was incomplete. He just didn't address many of the questions that I would expect a good critical thinker to ask. Instead of exploring these subjects, he seemed emotionally attached to quickly dismissing them because they used one questionable form of evidence. There was no discussion whatsoever about attaining a balanced view.

Another thing he harps on is that the term ""ancient"" remedy does not give a product validity. Granted the term is overused, but if something really has been used for hundreds of years, like acupuncture, for instance, it is worth investigating and as medicine has learned, using. Again he tries to extend his pet examples much too far and the attitude is the above dismissal rather than inquiry.

As noted, his rants extend well beyond fringe products and his approach is ""all or nothing"". He groups Chiropractors together with Faith Healers as if both were equally useless.
