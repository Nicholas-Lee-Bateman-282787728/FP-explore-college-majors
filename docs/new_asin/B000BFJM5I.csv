2417238,5,B000BFJM5I,"The Catherine Cookson Romantic dramas are non-pareil, and are at the very top of all of the romantic dramas, they are captivating, with great plots, also with a lot of great acting and action, They deserve six stars if allowed",1343606400,5,226,4.675
2417239,5,B000BFJM5I,"If you love period movies, this is a great set to buy. Catherine Cookson's books are wonderful also. You can't go wrong with any of her stories.",1322438400,,144,4.37037037037037

A wonderful boxed two story DVD of a truly gifted story teller, Catherine Cookson.
I have seen several of her stories on DVD and none of them disappoint. If one enjoys
the Victorian Era, you will be hooked on all the Catherine Cookson DVDs.  I was happily
surprised to get the bonus of the Catherine Cookson biography as told by the producer
of these films. The two gentlemen relating Catherine Cookson's story brought her to
life for me.  She was a remarkable woman and as fascinating as the tales she tells.
I look forward to reading her many novels.  Additionally, my parcel arrived just three
days after I placed my order and in perfect condition; Amazon never fails to please me
as a vendor!",1319241600,10,867,5.603053435114504
2417241,4,B000BFJM5I,"These are good stories, well-acted by British actors whom you will recognize from other British television programs and movies.",1258070400,8,127,5.7368421052631575
2417242,4,B000BFJM5I,"These two movies are dark and unhappy.....not something you want to look at to cheer you up, but they are well done and I guess life did turn out like that in the 19th century UK and those that survived just made the best of a bad situation....but I swear I don't think this is one I will want to view a second time.  Buy the earlier DVDs that have 8 movies on them.  They are a much happy view even with the ends in them not all skittles and beer, you won't lie awake and cry for a fictional character!",1185408000,28,503,3.9702970297029703
2417243,5,B000BFJM5I,"This is a very good set and a good buy. There is only one thing wrong with it, just as Pride and Prejudis it is NOT closed captioned which is a MUST in todays world of Baby Boomers who are getting a LITTLE hard of hearing.",1162512000,14,222,3.847826086956522
2417244,3,B000BFJM5I,"The Black velvet gown had good acting. The plot was a little weird. It was a little of a let down.

2417247,5,B000BFJM5I,"Well, this is a breath of fresh air--especially for the women in this story who all suffer from the smells of Victorian England and the lack of sanitary napkins. Sir Pheshees is great as he wanders through Northern England looking for a suitable boy in a kilt. My aunt who is almost 90, God bless her, cried at the end and unfortunately survived to order more of these box sets. And most of Cookson's beautifultails are about those funny boxes that men cannot stop craving.",1414713600,,473,4.576470588235294

2417249,3,B000BFJM5I,"I ordered and re-ordered this boxed set twice now with the same results, i.e. ""The Black Candle"" disc is OK, but the ""The Black Velvet Gown"" is defective no matter if you purchased this from Amazon or one of its venders.  The problem doesn't arise from whoever sells this item, it is a problem with the manufacturer who has released thousands of defective discs in this boxed set.  In my first set, the ""Gown"" disc went into digital blocks and then skipped, hopped, and jumped about making viewing impossible.  So I sent it back to the vender and Amazon sent me another boxed set that they were selling.  Result:  The very same as before.  If it was my VCR all of my DVDs would be having this same problem.  That is not the case, it is definitely a problem with the disc itself.  So be warned.  If you don't want to be sending and re-sending this item back to Amazon, buy ""The Black Candle"" separately  and stay away from any copies of ""The Black Velvet Gown"" altogether if you can.",1392940800,7,982,4.405555555555556
