6876434,5,B00QMD336W,"As a Cindy Lauper fan, I can say that this is a great performance, leaving aside the big stage and fanfare some new and not so new artists do in their shows, Cyndi gives all her power voice and seduces our memories as ww go back to the time her debut album was a huge success, re-living the moments and making us feel as it was the first time we listen to the whole She's so Unusual album. Definitely, absolutely a must have.",1446595200,,425,4.132530120481928

6876438,5,B00QMD336W,"I loved this. Cyndi Lauper is a great LIVE performer.
I don't understand the title of the bluray though, I mean, it is the 30th anniversary of the She's So Unusual album right? So why not put that as the title of the bluray?
The concert was fantastic. She was fantastic. And a great album.",1438128000,,289,4.2727272727272725

6876443,5,B00QMD336W,"What a testament to an artist of this calibre? This DVD is absolutely mind-blowing from Cyndi's performance, the band, over-all sound, to the lightning of the set, to the editing of the footage ... Everything's flawless ... Everything's there ""She's So Unusual"" live in its entirety 30 years later and still sounds fresh, alive and somehow new ... I got Japanese CD + DVD edition and paid ""fortune"" for it, after all these editions over the years, money totally well spent ... This DVD is a testament of great artist, great music and album ... I am so proud of Cyndi for putting this together and releasing this in this manner for fans ...",1432252800,4,639,4.614035087719298
6876444,4,B00QMD336W,"This was one of the best shows I've ever seen, I saw her at the Greek Theater in LA and her voice was in much better shape then as it was much earlier in the tour. I really wish that was the show they filmed. She even hit the high note in When You Were Mine in the show I saw but holds out on this Blu Ray. A bit unfortunate they waited so long to film it but make no mistake she's still really great! Oh and I really wish they had packaged it as the 30th Anniversary She's So Unusual tour not just ""Cyndi Lauper"".",1430956800,5,514,3.8130841121495327
6876445,5,B00QMD336W,I was there and the show was awsome!!!! I am so glad that now I can see anytime I want. Congratulations!!!!!,1430179200,,108,4.190476190476191
6876446,5,B00QMD336W,"Product came as described, nothing to complain at all. Great performance of one the icons of the 80's. Really worth having, specially those who really ""lived"" that decade.",1430092800,,171,5.142857142857143

8691900,3,B00QMD336W,"Cyndi's voice sounds pretty good (a good thing) but the sound of the instruments (band) is really really thin and flat (a bad thing).  Actually her voice stands out more than the band (not really a good thing). There isn't much difference from stereo to surround (5.1), its a little fuller but not very much, sound field get a tad broader.  A good modern surround recording blows this away but it's what we have.  Decent performance but lackluster sound... So if your a huge fan this might be of interest to you but not something the average fan needs to go out of their way.  I would rather listen to the albums.... sounds better.  Not that long concert.  Video is OK.
Have fun!  Boys and Girls!",1511049600,,696,4.476190476190476

She is still the best!!!",1470787200,,52,4.3
8691905,5,B00QMD336W,"Some people say she's to old.but she ain't.the voice has mellowed, the outfits still wild,
the hair(wig) WOW,but the narrative was over the top.in her younger days she would
shock one with a DROPPED word but i felt she dropped too many.she could leave that to
some comedians. THE show it's self was great the songs great so i still give her 5 stars.
she still entertains us THANK YOU.the CUZ",1469664000,,391,4.52112676056338
8691906,1,B00QMD336W,She's way past her prime here at 60 years old.  She can't move or sing like she once did.  She's dressed in all black and wearing a bad wig.  This isn't the colorful Cyndi Lauper from the 80s with iconic hairstyle by Patrick Lucas.  Shame there's no concert video of Cyndi when she was at her youthful best!  Imagine if the only concert footage we had of Taylor Swift is when she's 60 years old. Inexcusable!  All great artists deserve to be seen in their prime.  Especially Cyndi who was so freaking great in the 80s.  Where's the concert video from Cyndi's iconic 1984 Fun Tour for the She's So Unusual album with songs from Blue Angel?  Where's the concert video of 30 year old Cyndi in her prime?  Where?  This is so unfortunate.  It's just sad.  People have no idea how great this girl was in her prime because there is no complete footage from her 80s era concerts and now videos like this one of a 60 year old Cyndi just diminish her legacy so present and future generations will never know how great this girl was.  I'm crying.  Her iconic 1984 Fun Tour performance was a billion times better than what is shown here.,1466208000,,1125,4.367149758454106
