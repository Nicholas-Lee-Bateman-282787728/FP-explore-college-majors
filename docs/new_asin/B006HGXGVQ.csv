4990410,5,B006HGXGVQ,This is a must have.  Bobby is a very talented stand up comedian. I seen him several times live. A dvd or cd is a good substitute when you can't make his show.,1365379200,,159,3.8181818181818183
4990411,5,B006HGXGVQ,"If you are into standup comedy, this man is the funniest I've seen in years and cursing is not part of his comedy; foul terms and cursing don't make a comedian; this guy is extremely creative and has a great presentation..",1362873600,,222,4.439024390243903

8498483,3,B006HGXGVQ,"Hello: I bought the ""Bobby Collins Live ""dvd last week. My wife and I thought he was EXTREMELY FUNNY. So I just received another 2nd  Bobby Collins DVD called  ""Telling it Like it is"" DVD. We got through the first half of the dvd last night and then my wife said turn it off.  It repeated just about word for word in the first half of the older 2007 dvd that I first listened to called Bobby Collins Live. The people were laughing out of their minds in the room ,but we were not! It was a funny dvd if you had not seen the first dvd called "" Bobby Collins Live"".  This is a very very funny man. If you want 90 minutes of real enjoyment-He's the Man!!! but I would by the DVD called ""Bobby Collins Live"" It's worth every penny-really! I hope this helps.",1393459200,2,752,4.095238095238095
8498484,2,B006HGXGVQ,"the venue was annoying....a casino in CT. i think..He was not  as expected in front of the small audience...POOR CHOICE FOR A DVD!!!  I  have seen him before IN PERSON So i know what he is capable of...too much trouble to return, so I  will try one more of his and that is out of stock, and  as for this one, I would like to get  A CREDIT  when I receive the next one which is set  before  NYC audience",1393372800,,402,3.925
8498485,5,B006HGXGVQ,"Bobby Collins is a really funny, funny guy - you need to not be offended by the ""blue"" humor, though!  Seeing him on stage is so much better than just listening to him on CD.  His facial expressions and mannerisms are hilarious!  This is well worth the expense!!",1392595200,,262,4.416666666666667
8498486,3,B006HGXGVQ,I've seen better Bobby Collins DVD's.. This one is just a repeat of used skits that worked real well in his earlier dvd's but didn't work here for me.. Still Love Your Comedy Bobby!!,1382140800,,182,4.382352941176471
8498487,2,B006HGXGVQ,"I adore Bobby Collins humor but this album isn't good - most of it is ""dry"" humor - I hardly laughed at all.  It is amusing - but not great - that's for sure.",1379289600,,158,3.6470588235294117
8498488,4,B006HGXGVQ,"I've never done a review of a stand-up comedy routine before, so please bear with me. I like to try new things, but I may not always be the best at them on the first time out.

Bobby Collins - Telling It Like It Is, is a one hour stand-up comedy special that takes place at the Foxwoods resort in Connecticut. Only a couple hundred miles from where I live myself. So the few times that he dips into local humor, I'm in on the joke as well and it's quite funny. Bobby lives in California now, but was brought up in New York, which is also close to my home, and helps to identify with his unique brand of humor. I'd never heard of Bobby until I popped in this DVD. I'm not a huge fan of stand-up comedians, as I feel most of them flop once they try to film themselves for the home market. Bobby had a strike against him before I even pushed the play button, and at five minutes in, I was not going to change my mind. Then something good happened. I smiled. Then a few chuckles. Last thing I expected was to hear myself laughing. This performance got better as it went along, and I found myself liking the guy, and his type of humor, and I could identify with a lot of the things he was saying.

Being as this was a 2011 production, a lot of his jokes are about the government, jobs and even the Kardashians are still relevant now, and still funny. He had a widely varied show, and he writes all of his own material, and even helped produce the film. Subjects other than those mentioned range from his sixteen year old dog, the problems with meet and greets, airports, trying to understand the southern accent, the dollar store, incontinence and generally growing older. He had a good interaction with the audience, and some of his ad-lib's were even more funny than the material he had written for the show.

The DVD itself is fairly average. The one hour performance is shot in full screen with stereo sound (his attached mic does go off for about two or three minutes during the middle of the show, leaving only the audience mic to hear him by, but this is very brief and the sound returns to normal in a very short time). There is a bonus feature of an eight minute interview talking with Bobby about his life and career. To sum it all up, this is a worthy purchase for a funny good time from a comedian you might not have heard of before. Go pick it up.

8/10.",1372032000,,2362,4.23059866962306
