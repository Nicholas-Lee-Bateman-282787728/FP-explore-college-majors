2303145,5,B0009NZ2TM,"Garfield is one of the few cartoon DVD sets in which I have to get IMMEDIATELY when it comes out!!!!  I have really loved the previous editions.  I especially loved the fact that they show all the U.S. Acres Quickies as well as the original theme song that opened the show the first two seasons.  When the show was put in syndication, both the U.S. Acres Quickies and the original theme song were banished.  Not that I don't like the salsa beginning because it's great, I just missed listening to the old ""Friends Are There"" opening.

My only pet peeve with this is that they changed the title from U.S. Acres to ""Orson's Farm.""  It's ironic because the packaging still calls it ""U.S. Acres.""  However, this is a very minor complaint and it really means nothing because I love having all the U.S. Acres Quickies back.  Also, they're starting to show the episodes that never made it to syndication that were lost once CBS took the show off the air.

I'm really looking forward to this set.  I was reading in a previous review that the picnic episode about the ants will be featured in this set.  I can't wait because I love that episode!!!!  The sequel was very cute as well, and I'm assuming that will come out in the next volume.  The episode of ""U.S. Acres"" that airs right before the ants episode is a funny one for it's their take on the Abbott & Costello ""Who's On First Base?"" skit in which three dogs named, ""Who?"" ""What?"" and ""Where?"" come to the farm looking for jobs.  Classic, good humor.

Well, that's all I have to say about this exciting new Garfield edition that's coming to DVD.  I've always been a huge Garfield fan and the release of all the specials and cartoon show on DVD, as well as releasing all the classic Garfield books in Full Color (although they seem to have stopped after Book 9 which I have not found in any bookstore, nor was Amazon able to deliver it to me) only enhances it!!!!  Why can't we have good, clean, funny humor like Garfield that made my Saturdays worth getting up early in the morning for????  LONG LIVE GARFIELD!!!!",1119744000,6,2062,4.467914438502674
2303146,5,B0009NZ2TM,"Get ready garfield fans it's about to be reborn. Volume 4 contains my favorite episode of all time, the picnic panic and after all these years we finally get to see it again. Ed Bogas did a great job on this one writing the music and doing the voices for the ants. I can still remember some of the words, but not that clearly. I always loved when this episode was on. Another 75 garfields and U.S. Acres shorts from the forth and fifth season on this one, but again no extras. The plus side, many of these haven't been seen in at least 11 years. Relive your past with some truly great episodes. An absolute must for any fan of the show. Here's what to expect on the three discs set:

2303165,5,B0009NZ2TM,had to have my title replaced after my first purchase was crushed. The outer box was fine but the contents were heavily damaged. It is terrible that the warehouse people did not care enough to include a proper item because there was no way the stocker didn't see the damage. Amazon was very prompt to replace it. I also purchased two other seasons that arrived separately and they were equally damaged. My request for replacement did specifically ask them to double check the item for damage before shipping. My replacements were excellent.,1359331200,,540,4.880434782608695
2303166,5,B0009NZ2TM,I'm a huge Garfield fan ever since I was a little girl. I had the first 3 season but was missing 4 and 5. I recieved it before the delivery date and the package was as if I bought it at the store. very nice,1355702400,,206,3.6

2303187,4,B0009NZ2TM,The Garfield was a great show that I never saw as a child because no one carried it.  So seeing it on DVD was a real treat and it is a must see for any Garfield fan.,1210377600,,165,3.4594594594594597
2303188,5,B0009NZ2TM,My son and I love watching these old cartoons together.  We watch a couple episodes at night; it's a fun way to bond.  We can't wait to get the next season!,1179619200,,156,4.0
2303189,5,B0009NZ2TM,"If you love Garfield,cats, sarcasam, and downright innocent fun, Garfield & Friends Season Four is for you. This is a DVD set that you will pull out time and time again for hours of laughter on each of the three DVD's.",1168300800,,218,4.341463414634147
2303190,5,B0009NZ2TM,"This was my favorite Saturday Morning cartoon show when I was a kid. My favorite cartoon on this DVD is a US Acre cartoon with three brothers.  The brothers' names are very funny. To find out what their names are, watch this DVD.",1167868800,,229,4.325581395348837
2303191,5,B0009NZ2TM,"""If you only watch one show, make it this one,"" Garfield quips in one of the opening credits. I'm inclined to agree. With three seasons of the show under their belts, Garfield's writers hit their stride with lines like, ""If you don't like the show, My name's Heathcliffe"" (a rival cartoon cat), and ""Jest not with a craven duck."" Volume four includes shows from the fourth and fifth season of ""Garfield and Friends,"" but while many shows run out of steam before then, or morph and become ""extreme,"" Garfield instead became self-referential, with Garfield frequently intervening in his own cartoon. Recurring characters complain about their bit parts and Garfield notes with nonchallant disinterest the recurring themes. There are bits of the opening animation that have been changed including, unfortunately, the initial scene of Garfield on the fence. The new bits don't synch with the song as well, but at least most of the shots survive, as well as the ""party"" opening theme. All of which makes Garfield gato nemero uno in the lineup of great cartoons.",1131408000,,1055,5.0
2303192,5,B0009NZ2TM,I have always loved Garfield and Friends and this DVD is just as funny as I remember them being when I was a kid.  I can't wait until the next season comes out on DVD.,1128816000,,167,3.7714285714285714
2303193,3,B0009NZ2TM,"As much as I absolutely loved this series, volume 4 marks the beginning of the show's decline.  These episodes repeat many of the same jokes found in the earlier episodes (from volumes 1-3), and the humor is much drier here.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed.  I'm still anxious to get my hands on volume 5, but primarily just to complete my collection.  If you haven't seen volumes 1-3, I highly recommend them over this one!",1126051200,3,427,4.578947368421052
2303194,5,B0009NZ2TM,"I've gotten all 4 Volumes released so far. With this fourth release, I find alot of episodes I don't recall (so likely never saw).

 As others have said, have great ones like ""Rainy Day Robot"" (""twenty-seven pianos""), ""The Creature That Lived in the Refrigerator..."" (""Oh, to the -left- of the cole slaw""),and ""Picnic Panic"" (""We're the ants who take your food..."").

 And, as said above, I had some fun first-timers on this set too. Though haven't watched it all, from the ep. listings looks like about half the set will be new to me.",1126051200,,535,4.659574468085107

8063706,2,B0009NZ2TM,"The first seasons of the show must have been better than this one(next to the last volume set), because it had a few laughs out of the whole 3 disc set. I remembered the show to be a lot funnier than this! Each episode has 2 mini shows of Garfield with 1 of US Acres. I'd estimate between 66-72 mini shows in the entire set. With all of those episodes, there is a lot of opportunity for laughs; you may be surprised when the laughs just aren't there--esp. if you watched the earlier shows when you were a kid and saw the great reviews of volume 4 here on amazon and were thinking of picking this one up, you may be disappointed.

FYI: It's not really for kids younger than 9 years old. I tutor kids younger than that, so I know about how they think. The jokes may go right over their heads and young kids like to see sweetness or action--even if, it's silly--depending on boy or girl. Garfield does not offer these at all! Also, there is a direct LGBT reference way back in '92/'93 on a kids' TV show! This happens on the US Acres mini show where Wade duck plays Snow White and gets kissed where a normal person's lips would be by both Roy Rooster and Orson Pig with their lips! One Garfield mini show has a ghost called diablo and--if your child is Hispanic--they may know what that means. Best shows: 1. The US Acres mini show about Who, What, Where, etc.(Abbott&Costello clone). 2. Garfield mini show where the guy tries to speed up Jon's daily routine. 3. The first ants' picnic singing show. 4. Orson's brothers made good shows, too, on the US Acres. Worst shows(bad shows are too many to count):  US Acres mini show about Snow White and there were a lot more bad ones--like some of the references to history(weren't done well). If you're going to buy this volume for kids, then go to youtube--using someone's phone who has unlimited streaming video and unlimited data--and watch them first. Disc 3 should be guarded and watched with your kids(and the LGBT shows should be skipped)!

Would I recommend Garfield & Friends Vol. 4? A big NO--if you do, then never allow your kids to watch disc 3 by themselves(LGBT Snow White show is on it)! Never give it as a gift to another family!",1482796800,,2186,4.405940594059406
8063707,1,B0009NZ2TM,The dvds are great but the place where I got it hike their prices up as soon as they see you looking at their merchandise.,1481328000,,122,3.92
8063708,5,B0009NZ2TM,"Volume 4 of Garfield and Friends has yet another 24 whole shows; once you have volumes 1 to 3, don't stop there! (There's only one more after this one!) Starting with this set, the theme song's video footage is revised with newer episodes' footage, but the song remains the same; ""We're Ready to Party"". This season is also famous for the debut of ""the singing ants"" and Garfield's girlfriend Penelope. Due to creative differences and personality problems with the show's creators about Arlene, she was never in this series, even though she ended up in the CGI series. It was also in this set that Roy Rooster has a niece, which proved Roy has a nice side to him once and for all. What's more, Garfield meets his match in a real copycat, who was so good at being just like Garfield, he should've been thrown in jail for copyright infringement, as Garfield put him! Nothing can replace an original, as Garfield and Friends has proved to this very day with these DVD sets. This set and the final volume set contain a lot of episodes not seen in syndication, and hadn't been seen on TV since they debuted on CBS in the 1990's! If you're not already aware of it, there's a big surprise waiting in volume 5, it contains the final 25 shows and the same theme song as most of the series up to here, instead of the ""Rappy"" theme song lots of people hated, via all the episodes on DVD are international prints. But let's not get ahead of the game, every volume set is a wonder to behold for fans young AND old alike, even this one!",1432684800,,1522,4.400709219858156

8063710,3,B0009NZ2TM,"Who doesn't love Garfield? I mean seriously.  I watched all this as a child and loved it.  But, looking back at it I now realize it was a little harsh.  What I mean is this is 80's/90's style humor which is all about making fun of someone.  Garfield spends a lot of time talking about how dumb Jon is.  While this is the nature of the strip, I just felt weird about having my 8 year old watching an animated cat talking sh*t about his owner 24/7.  I'm not particularly sensitive about these things but I felt the humor was unnecessarily harsh.  It is definitely harsher than in the comic strips of which my son has many of the books.",1419984000,,633,4.225
