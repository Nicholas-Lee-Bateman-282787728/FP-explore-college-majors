""Between God, The Devil & A Winchester"" stars Richard Harrison and Gilbert Roland, two solid stars of the genre, in a fun treasure hunt story.

""Johnny Yuma"" is a fairly violent example of a Spaghetti Western, starring Mark Damon and sexy Rosalba Neri.  This is a pretty entertaining film all in all.
