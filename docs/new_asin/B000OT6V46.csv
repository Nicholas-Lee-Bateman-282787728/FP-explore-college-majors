2799361,3,B000OT6V46,"The picture quality is as good as it could be for having been produced in the late 70's.  The trouble with the older novelas is that they are redubbing the suspense music fans have come to identify with the novelas.  It is obvious to anyone that this is done for royalty reasons, but the new music is just cheap and dreadful.  I quite don't understand the royalty factor since you could still hear the old music underneath if you lend a close ear and in their attempt to drown it out, they distort the actors' lines at times.  Like all other new to DVD novelas, it is severely edited.  Though fans are well familiar with the storylines, the editing is a bit extreme.  But I digress,  and fans will still buy these.  I did!  I love amazon to death but there are some retail outlets where you can get these same versions for cheaper.",1208563200,5,831,4.3441558441558445
2799362,1,B000OT6V46,"Don't buy!!! Read all the reviews you can before you waste your money. Televisa and Xenon Pictures are ripping us off. I was anxious to get this home from the store. The back of the DVD box is misleading. It lists the main theme as Aprendi A Llorar sung by Veronica Castro. I remember the explosive entrance to this theme and that's what I was expecting. I also expected a well edited, well produced, well taken care of version. I felt robbed and lied to after I watched this. Part of what makes a novela a success is its music. The cheesey, bland music they've used in novelas such as Piel de Otoo and Los Ricos Tambien Lloran are shameful at best. They are a rip-off. It is just Televisa trying to earn more money with a ""what the heck"" attitude. They figure some of us will buy them, expecting the same quality as when they're shown on TV, but are an incredible rip-off. This is the second and last novela I'll buy from Televisa. I keep hoping someone will start an all classic telenovela channel and then, I'll record them myself to enjoy them as they were originally made.",1208476800,12,1077,4.39
2799363,5,B000OT6V46,"I bought this novela because it was Veronica Castro's biggest success.  ""Los Ricos Tambien Lloran"" is the novela that made her famous and I definitely wanted to see it.  Maria La del barrio is an exact copy of this novela with a few things different in the beginning but ultimately is the same, they even recreated so many scenes from los ricos tambien lloran.

Now for the actual DVD, I can say that the editing was well done, a bit fast paced, but that was ok because it had a long running time.  The scenes are longer just like many 70's and 80's telenovelas so we get to see a lot of dialogue.  The music from the original is not there, but thats ok because we get an array of different scores.  I liked it.  I thought that ROgelio Guerra looked PHENOMENAL and Veronica Castro is as beautiful as ever.  I was also very happy to finnaly see Christian Bach in a telenovela DVD.  She looked beautiful in her role and just like veronica they have this timeless beauty about them.  The acting was solid.  Very very good actors who took their roles to heart.  Veronica's subtle voice and actions are really something to smile about!",1190937600,,1130,4.432038834951456
2799364,5,B000OT6V46,"This DVD has an excellent quality of image and the story is great, the only thing I would suggest is that it would've been even better if they had the original music of the novela, besides that I had a wonderfull time watching it and remembering those great episodes.",1185062400,,267,4.469387755102041
2799365,5,B000OT6V46,"I wanted this novela as a child and I was fascinated by it. Having in DVD helps relive those moments.  The quality and story is fascinating. This is how the classical novelas were made. They no longer make this kind of novelas and it is sad. In this novela there is drugs, violence, and unappropriate language. The story still warms my heart.",1181606400,3,342,4.516129032258065
2799366,2,B000OT6V46,"I have been buying these abridged DVD telenovelas for quite sometime and have enjoyed them. There have been some f'ed up ones (Cuna De Lobos, Lazos De Amor) and there have been some near flawless ones (Amarte Es Mi Pecado, Dulce Desafio, Amor En Custodia). However, ""Los Ricos Tambien Lloran"", the original telenovela clasica, comes in a DVD version so embarrasing it's offensive to its legacy.

I was not expecting the original score at all since I know Televisa Home Entertainment is cheap and does not want to pay royalties. But they have incorporated a new score and theme song that sometimes is so loud it ovewhelms dialogue to inaudible levels. It's terrible!

And the editing of this is probably one of the worst. I understand this telenovela ran for 200 episodes originally, but while most of the DVD telenovelas cut off certain storylines, ""Los Ricos"" tries to piece together everything but often times ends up putting only the end of a topic and one is left confused when we see things happen that had no explanation.

And finally, the picture quality. Some parts look amazing..and others have lines and changes of colour as if they came from a bad video transfer. I don't know if the transfer Televisa had of this has gone away but it certainly could have used some colour adjustment.

It's unfortunate that Televisa Home Entertainment lacked proffesionalism when releasing this classic telenovela to the public. It would have been great to see this one in all its glory and give it the respect and praise it deserves and not this bastardized version.",1181606400,28,1562,4.8389513108614235
2799367,4,B000OT6V46,"This is a classic of all times. I would had given it a five star but one of my favorite scenes was cut off, which was when Luis Alberto and Esther were dancing there feet off in a club with a nice Donna Summer song. Every single actor did an awesome job and each role fitted them well. This telenovela has it all. It makes you laugh, cry, shocked, romance and so on. A must have and see for Veronica Castro fans.",1388707200,,412,4.036585365853658
2799368,3,B000OT6V46,I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS WAS NOT AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE THE STORY WOULD HAVE MADE MORE SENSE TO ME.  WHO THE HECK EDITED THIS AND IS THERE ANY WAY TO STOP THEM FROM CHOPPING UP THESE STORIES. THEY REPRESENT MY CULTURE AND THEY NEED TO BE TOLD IN THIER ENTIRETY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  SO SAD.,1361404800,4,295,4.157894736842105
2799369,2,B000OT6V46,"Los Ricos tambien lloran is very boring , goes and back in the same think over and over again
I bought it because of the actress , that I like very much , but the developing of the novela I didn't like it at all",1356480000,,211,3.7111111111111112
2799370,1,B000OT6V46,"Before buying this product I had the benefit of viewing many of the original episodes of this telenovela. I began watching it because I had heard from many sources that this is among the best if not THE best telenovela of all times. Having watched these episodes I can say that in its original form, this telenovela could definitely be the best of all time.

Having bought this product and viewed all the DVDs I am extremely disappointed.

First, the original music is overdubbed with annoying modern music. I understand that music licenses are hard to come by, but they could have been bought if the producers had been less greedy. Also, the music is sometimes too loud to hear the dialog. If they wanted to avoid paying for the original music, they should have used modern technology to remove the original music and added music at the normal volume (instead of a lame semi-removal of the original music with a too-loud overdub to cover it up.

Second, and much worse, around 125 hours of original content is reduced to around 13 hours. So, this butchered product represents about 10% of the original telenovela. Yes, they tried to include the ""high points"", but so much is left out the viewer is bewildered about what is happening. You will find yourself asking ""where did that character go?"" and ""where did this new character come from?"", etc. It is a travesty when compared with the beauty of the original episodes in their entirety.

Yes, it would cost a lot to sell the original telenovela with its large number of required disks. However, the original is such a work of art that I believe true fans would pay the required price to see it. In short, this flawed collection does a disservice to the millions of fans as well as the people who starred in and created this telenovela. In no way should one buy this butchered product. It is garbage. A better rating would be 1% of 1 star.",1340496000,,1890,4.599406528189911

2799374,5,B000OT6V46,"The Amazon product description only describes the 2nd half of the story.

The first half of the story is an awesome story that could be a separate soap from the 2nd half.

The 2nd half of this story is similar to another soap called ""Maria La del barrio"" that was made about a decade after this one.

CONS: The picture quality. Some parts look amazing..and others have lines and changes of colour as if they came from a bad video transfer.

However, I would still buy it for the great story and great acting!

I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps but Latin soaps are like great movies. Gorgeous latin women!",1234569600,,628,4.426086956521739
2799375,5,B000OT6V46,"I remember back in the 80's visiting Mexico City and there was no where you could go without watching this. The streets would empty when it was on at night. Got hooked immediately and followed it when I returned to the US and proceeded to get my mother and sister hooked in as well!  THE BEST mexican soap opera ever.  Had the rich vs the poor, evil vs. good, kidnapped children, tears and laughter. What more can you ask?  If you've never watched a ""telenovela"" before this is a good way to start.",1231459200,2,498,4.333333333333333

I watched it before with Turkish dubbing (in Turkey) so I could understand it then. But now that I live in the states, I needed it in English - but to no avail.
