8215942,5,B000V02CRI,I love all things British and was glad to buy this dvd as I enjoyed it very much. Dvd sent in good condition.,1368057600,,109,3.782608695652174
8215943,3,B000V02CRI,"Originally presented in 1992 by London Weekend Television LWT/ITV. Includes 6 25-minute programs. Attempts to cover all sides of various political and monetary issues which were in the air at the time, doesn't flinch from controversy, and includes interviews with some who voice highly critical points of view. Quite a lot has changed since then, but it remains an interesting time-capsule. Elizabeth II's personal style, attitudes, and work ethic have become so entwined with people's ingrained understanding of how a monarch and sovereign generally behaves that it is going to be a great jolt when she is inevitably succeeded by someone who isn't an exact duplicate.",1230163200,,668,5.311320754716981
8215944,4,B000V02CRI,"Good for it's time, but very dated now. Much of the footage is from the late 80s or early 90s. An excellent documentary, but not current.",1198972800,3,137,4.3076923076923075
8215945,2,B000V02CRI,"This is a well done piece however very dated by at least a decade.  Rather disappointing.  A lot has happened with the Royal Family (the divorce of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the death of Princess Diana, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, etc.)  It should be pointed out to your customers just how old this is. I bought a second copy along with my own to give as a Christmas gift and was very upset to learn just how dated this is.",1198713600,7,440,4.27710843373494
