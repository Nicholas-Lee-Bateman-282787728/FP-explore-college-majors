8002941,3,B0000TWN6K,"Typical 3am Cinemax or Showtime type fare (but no sex). No budget whatsoever. The film is okay to watch once, but nothing stands out as being spectacular. It never really rises about mediocre territory, and at times was laughable. Btw, Jamie Pressley is only in it for a total of 3 mins, but this movie is from 1997, when she was basically unknown.. On a technical note; the DVD picture was messed up. It looks as if it were transferred from a bad cable reception print;  too bright with interference lines running vertically through the picture, which were more distorted at random moments, and yes, it's the original Echo Bridge disc. You can tell it was mastered/transferred (by EB) from a VHS tape source. Don't pay more than $1!",1462665600,,733,4.682170542635659

8002943,3,B0000TWN6K,Nick Mancuso and the police cast were good. The rest of the film was strictly ham bone. Good for giggles.,1443830400,,105,4.3

8002946,3,B0000TWN6K,"I bought this because I wanted to see what Grieco could do in a movie vs tv.  This turned out to be cheesy, but entertaining modern version of a western.  Whoever did the outfits for him did a great job.",1377561600,,203,4.05
