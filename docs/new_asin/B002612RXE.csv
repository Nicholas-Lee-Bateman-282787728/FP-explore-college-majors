Loving how Rivers did the spontaneous setlist for the gig.
Very humble and intimate show.

Good job Rivers :)",1364256000,,124,4.857142857142857
8351639,5,B002612RXE,"This DVD is a medley of songs, new and old, from both Weezer's and Rivers Cuomo's solo albums. Performed by Rivers himself plus a collection of amateur musicians, a wide spectrum of musical talent and fan dedication is shown as they preform hit after hit. The extras include awesome behind the scene recordings of Cuomo's Alone II, interviews, and videos. This disc is a must have for any Weezer or Rivers fan!",1297036800,4,410,4.708333333333333
