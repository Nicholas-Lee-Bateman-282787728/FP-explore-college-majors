8184290,4,B000OCXL9Q,"I gave it four stars because of the following reasons:

1.  The beginning was slow but did introduce complications that took the show on a permanent route.  Sigh...  Logan Cale, I feel you bro.
2.  The arc of Max attempting to keep things together tended to end pretty differently.
3.  Where's the answers when the season ended?  What about Father Sandman?  What about the virus?  What about Max's transgenic brothers and sisters?  What of the cult and it's true agenda?  What about Col. Lydecker?  Answers that were unanswered.
4.  The first season Max showed an overpowering Max as she uses stealth, subterfuge and evasion to keep herself alive.  Second season brings her to kick anyone's ass but ends up getting licked by humans, some transgenics and Ames White.  Second season Max may be more heads on but I prefer first season Max because that's exactly how Max Guevara would have become due to her training.
5.  Enemies were varied but not exactly the types to bring danger.  Some are dangerous but not so much to literally kill our favorite Max.

Second season sucks in the beginning but it picks up.  Stick around to see how our sexy kick ass Max Guevara makes it in the second season.",1509062400,,1193,4.676328502415459
