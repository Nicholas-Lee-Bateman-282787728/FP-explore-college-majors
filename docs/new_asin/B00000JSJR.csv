What about The dear Hunter.  Also Taxi Driver!!  Taxi Driver is possibly De Niro's best performance ever.  And where is the classic Raging Bull!!.  Well if you can get past the annoyence of these great movies being left out, then I'm sure you will enjoy the other movies in the collection which are indeed good.  It's just annoying these great movies arn't recognized or in the collection.",996192000,,566,4.355769230769231
1238683,2,B00000JSJR,"A Robert De Niro box set to me should be exactly that, A Robert De Niro box set. This compilation is an interesting mix of great and not-so-great movies. In the latter category, ""HEAT"" ( which has to be the most  over-hyped promotional tour-de-force ever heard) DE NIRO and PACINO  TOGETHER! . O.K.... then what? You still need to make a movie. As for the  choices, Wag, Bronx, Analyze, I enjoyed them to a certain degree but didn`t  feel the need to scream it at top of my lungs when I came out of the  theatre. The undisputable winner in this category is inevitably GOODFELLAS.A  masterpiece. I consider myself to be a true De Niro fan and as such, find  it difficult to imagine a De Niro collection without Raging Bull or Taxi  Driver, just to name a few. Alright, I`ll name a few more. Awakenings, Cape  Fear, Mean Streets....HEY!  What do you know?  Here`s a box set to  really sink your teeth in. These movies clearly show Robert De Niro`s  amazing talent. Afterall, we are talking about Robert De Niro.",957744000,,1009,4.50828729281768
1238684,5,B00000JSJR,"All five of these De Niro films are great, even Wag The Dog which surprised me. I will keep this short and sweet since I'm also reviewing each film separately in greater detail: Any De Niro fan would be a stunad to miss this set. Get a taste of Mob life in GoodFellas and A Bronx Tale.  Get a good laugh from Analyze This. A good cops-and-robbers from Heat (with  the great Al Pacino). And a good political comedy with Wag The Dog. These  are all excellent, and worthy of a top shelf spot in your collection.",954374400,,508,4.216494845360825
1238685,5,B00000JSJR,"If you are a Robert De Niro fan, you need this set of DVDs!  I enjoyed every single one of these films, from the hilarious 'Analyze This' to Wag The Dog, and a little bit of Mob Action in 'Goodfellas' and tie it together  with 'A Bronx Tale' and, my personal action favorite, 'HEAT'.  Five Stars!  Superb!",939772800,,305,4.298245614035087

7913519,2,B00000JSJR,"Blu ray DVD movie Heat not very good quality packaging very cheap, I buy a lot of DVD's I will not",1355788800,,98,3.7142857142857144
7913520,5,B00000JSJR,"A lot of people have complained about this collection because they claim it doesn't house De Niro's best films. Let me break it down this way: Warner Bros. released this box set (as well as an Al Pacino version) and they are only allowed to include films licensed through WB. Therefore, most Martin Scorsese/De Niro classics such as Raging Bull (MGM), Taxi Driver (Columbia), Casino (Universal) etc. cannot legally be included. They'd have to make some sort of deal with all the major movie studios, and that's practically impossible.

So, for what's included here, it's a great place to start a De Niro collection. You can usually find it on the market for $59.99 -- divide it by five... yeah, it's a pretty cheap deal when you consider the fact that these DVDs by themselves cost around $11 - $12 in the average video store.

ANALYZE THIS -- Not a great film, but De Niro is very funny and it's an essential De Niro movie as it's not only one of his best comedic performances, but one of his most popular films. If you're a De Niro buff, and you don't own this, you might get some skeptical glances from other fans.

WAG THE DOG -- An underrated, sharp satire with a great ensemble cast, well directed by Barry Levinson (""Rain Man""). I can see why some might not like it, but if you enjoyed ""Bulworth"" and similar political satires, you'll like this. (For the record, I thought it was far subtler and more intellectual than ""Bulworth"" was, although they're both fine comedies.) Dustin Hoffman is actually better than De Niro in this in my opinion - he's really funny.

GOODFELLAS - This has since been released on a Special Edition DVD but this standard-disc version is still good enough... it's got the same transfer as the SE version and the trailers as well... it doesn't have the commentary or the documentaries, but I heard the commentary -- split into different sections -- is a waste of time and the docs are only so-so... at $10 it's a pretty good deal and one of the top five De Niro films of all time. You can always upgrade letter.

HEAT -- This has also been re-released recently but nevertheless this disc is pretty good for an older DVD release... the movie itself is awesome. The new DVD is better, but again, you can always upgrade if you enjoy it enough.

A BRONX TALE -- Robert De Niro directed this and in my opinion it's one of the greatest gangster/Mafia films ever made, and unique because it deals with different aspects of the genre that even Martin Scorsese doesn't touch upon in some of his films. De Niro is excellent in it and he does a terrific job behind the camera. I'm thrilled to hear he's directing a film next year -- after seeing this I was in awe of just how talented he is behind the camera.

So overall if you're new to De Niro this is a good place to start, and if you're building up a collection there's a good chance you're going to want most of these films sooner or later... at a pricetag of $60 it's a pretty good deal and I'd recommend it to anyone. The only other De Niro film I know of that WB had the rights to and should have included here was ""Sleepers,"" also directed by Levinson (""Wag the Dog"")... you should seek that out after buying this, it's a good movie.",1115769600,,3215,4.438983050847457
7913521,3,B00000JSJR,"What a weird selection of an actor's work. It would have made more sense if they did a Scorsese/De Niro compliation. Now there's a winning collection: Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, and The King Of Comedy.
But if you're a fan of everything De Niro, this is a cost effective means of expanding your collection.",1048723200,,330,4.807017543859649
7913522,1,B00000JSJR,"For such a great actor, I expected to see his best films-not a collection of his so-so films. The movies are good, but it's a huge diappointment to true De Niro fans.",1035590400,,166,4.21875

7913524,3,B00000JSJR,"What about ""Taxi driver"", ""Mean Streets"", ""The King of Comedy"",
""The Godfather II"" and ""Once Upon A Time In America""? This selection was ok, but I would have put the movies I just mentioned with ""Analize This"" and ""Goodfellas"". I give it 3 stars.",1020556800,,246,4.613636363636363
7913525,4,B00000JSJR,This is a good first start with excellent films. The fans deserve a wider choice but it's unfair for people to criticize the selection that was released in 1999 for not having films released in 2000.,1009670400,,199,4.555555555555555
7913526,2,B00000JSJR,"What about Once upon a time in America, The Untouchables,Cape Fear, Men of Honor, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and 15 Minutes?  I would have purchased this collection in a heartbeat if it included his best work. The films in this collection are good, but does not reflect his all of DeNiro's most popular performances (with the exception of Goodfellas).  This collection is like qualifying for the olympics.  A little taste of what you can do before you collect the gold metal. Analyze This should have been in a comedy pack along with Meet the Parents and Raging Bull.  Wag the dog, although ok, should have been left out.",1004486400,,621,4.722222222222222
7913527,2,B00000JSJR,"I only agree with 2 movies on this set.  ""Analyze This"" & ""Goodfellows"", it would have been better if ""Once Upon A Time in America"" were included.  They could have left out the rest, I'm sure glad they didn't add Rocky & Bullwinkle to this set.  He is a great actor, and the choices could have been better, for that reason I give it 2 stars....",999561600,,344,4.181818181818182
