8683101,5,B00OBN3UEA,"If you are a fan of the Chilli Pipers, you know they are a band to be seen for the most enjoyment of their music. I love their live concerts; and, for those times you don't get to attend one, this 2 hour concert video is good stand-in. The music is great, of course, and watching them work makes the experience even better. The Chillis are a group of musicians who genuinely seem to have fun when performing, which adds to the enjoyment. The one complaint I have with the dvd is that there is so much background noise that the speakers' comments in most of the ""extras"" segment are drowned out.",1493683200,,594,4.3125
