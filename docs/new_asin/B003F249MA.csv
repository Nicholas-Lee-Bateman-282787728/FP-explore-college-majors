8445560,5,B003F249MA,"I just bought this one on Video On Demand and I just wanted to test my new ROKU XDS which I got recently. I just wanted to check if the online streaming video from Amazon Works but I was really touched by this couple. I was in Rwanda in 1994 and I was 12 at that time but I still remember what happened there, it was horrible! I wish this couple could be a perfect example for young people-future generation, where a hutu is able to marry a tutsi and vice versa. May God bless this couple and all other similar couples.",1297728000,4,519,4.098039215686274
