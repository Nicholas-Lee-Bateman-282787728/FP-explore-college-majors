8054646,1,B0007Z2W4K,This is rip off. It was recorded off the tv when there was a Carol Burnett marathon on. I recently ordered the real episodes and they are wonderful. Don't fall for this like I did! I wanted to give zero stars.,1360627200,,209,4.121951219512195

8054648,5,B0007Z2W4K,"Absolutely AWESOME !!!
I'm not sure that Carol Burnett and company have ever made any bad skits...
All of the regulars, and guests are wonderful !!!!
And Carol Burnette would look beautiful even in a potato sack, as long as Bob Mackie designed it !!
(I've bought quite a few Bob Mackie outfits on QVC, too)",1276992000,,306,4.482142857142857
8054649,1,B0007Z2W4K,"I agree that there should be a dvd for each season but would also suggest that a dvd be made of just the 'lat-late show' take-off's. what a great dvd that would be. Mildred Fierce, Swiped Life, The Heiress, Little Foxies etc.. I'd buy a dozen and give them all as gifts!!!!",1266451200,2,273,4.269230769230769
8054650,4,B0007Z2W4K,"Another fine entry in the Burnett collection, so crisply remastered that it's like stepping back into time! Carl Reiner is the guest in one show, and Steve Lawrence is in the other. Of the two, I liked the Carl Reiner show the best. Reiner's presence (as a great funnyman in his own right as a Sid Caesar regular & ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"") lent a great deal of comic lunacy to the sketches.
Another good selection; keep it up!",1242864000,2,427,4.35
8054651,4,B0007Z2W4K,will someone please tell me if the family skits with vicki carol and harvey are on this dvd before i buy it thats primarily my interest,1212192000,,135,4.230769230769231
8054652,1,B0007Z2W4K,someone is being selfish. all other series and collections have whole seasons or more of shows on them. the carol burnett show only has two or three on them. major rip off. im waiting for the season collections.,1201305600,21,211,4.578947368421052
