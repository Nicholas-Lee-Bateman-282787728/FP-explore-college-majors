8648052,4,B00J4LMICO,"Flawed in it's story telling, this outdoor adventure still manages to deliver some action and beautiful scenery. The leads all do well in their roles. The biggest flaw is some seemingly stupid choices by the two lead characters.",1488672000,,228,5.026315789473684

8648054,4,B00J4LMICO,"A veteran returning home, Ben Cross played in a very low key way by Nathan Waring (enjoyed him) meets a girl on the road and strikes up a very quick relationship she is Nina played horribly by Laura Anderson and they run afoul of a lunatic Vincent Stone who apparently snatches people and hunts them and he wants to hunt Ben, he uses Nina to force him to play. I'd have let him have the bad actress. VERY slow movie very deliberate it finally gets moving when Ben stops running and strikes back. Would I recommend it....not sure it plods along sometimes. The hunter, he was pretty good, I loved how you see his frustration build when he can't kill Ben as easily as the others he's hunted.",1419033600,,688,4.3828125
8648055,2,B00J4LMICO,An odd little movie; seemed like it may have been a made for TV film.  I wonder if this was made for Australia's version of Lifetime.  The cinematography was redeeming to some extent and there was one beautiful scene towards the end that was well done.  I often watch low rated movies that I end up liking a lot more than other raters.  This was not one of them.  The other reviewers are accurate.,1409443200,,397,4.3108108108108105
8648056,5,B00J4LMICO,The psycho in this movie is pretty awesome one of the best psychos I've seen. It's not perfect movie but I loved the chase scenes through the Ozzi bush and forests some really cool scenes in the bush at night that are super scary. The music is really excellent. I'd watch The Backpacker again pretty good solid thriller.,1409356800,,320,4.5344827586206895
8648057,1,B00J4LMICO,"The Backpacker- Where do I began? Oh, the out back! I was glad when the last shot was fired. I knew the movie was finally over. It was a major let down for me, For the guy who was to be a army veteran his awareness and training really failed him. For one he kept radio contact with his enemy instead of radio silence while on the move. Second for a army sniper the first thing comes to your mind or from your training after you wounded your enemy is to grab an string weapon rather than the weapon you're trained on. Then you sent the female alone after you rescued her....(Won't tell the movie). Bottom line don't expect to see an well scripted movie or well acted out characters that are believable. Weak in all points perhaps I am too hurt, being a army vet as well. I won't be the one to say don't waste your money. Because it's yours, I would only say that there're much better choices. So to take it to the Side Bar Review: The  Backpacker, ""I wished I had never unpacked it.""",1406851200,,982,4.195767195767195
8648058,1,B00J4LMICO,stupid waste of money!!!,1406505600,,24,5.25
8648059,1,B00J4LMICO,This movie should be called Fudgecrapper because it ain't nothing but shuh hitt!!!! Please save your $4+ and life's precious time....seriously horrible!!!!,1405814400,,155,6.090909090909091
8648060,2,B00J4LMICO,"Military veteran Ben Cross (Nathan Waring) and his girlfriend Nina (Laura Andersen) decide to hitchhike/ backpack across rural Australia, visiting small rural bars that play death metal music. There are posters of missing people in the area. ""Stay off the back roads"" is written on a restroom mirror.

In spite of the warnings our couple decide to break up and hitchhike as Nina claims ""Hitchhiking is a girl's game,"" so Ben takes her on her challenge. Eventually this turns into a human hunting game with a guy named Vincent (Vincent Stone) who has a French accent and camouflage make-up.

This is not the best in genre. Ben is a minor league Rambo, which makes him more believable. Most of the action takes place off screen. When a person is head butted with a rifle, we never see the blow to the head. Even simple face slapping to done facing away from the camera.

A film likes this appeals to people who want to see the violence, not just the results. If you decide you are not going to show the violence, then we need an ""A"" plan with better stars and plot.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Off screen rape?",1405728000,2,1123,4.544554455445544
