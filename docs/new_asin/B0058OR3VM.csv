8462060,1,B0058OR3VM,Didn't know a thing about Adele until I saw her perform in London the day before the royal wedding. Not only did her voice knock my socks off I really enjoyed her zest for life....no matter where it takes her. Humble ansd hilarious ! OY ! Saw this DVD and bought it and was LIVID. I was prepared for a interview but this is something someone made in their basement. To say it is awful is to kind. Save your money. A legit bio will be coming now that she stole the Grammys. And she deserved everyone of them!,1329091200,,507,4.1313131313131315
8462061,1,B0058OR3VM,what a waste of time and money!! downloaded interviews taken from tv and put on disc....nothing new anywhere. A total load of crap. Dont even think of wasting your money on this.,1323302400,3,178,4.59375
8462062,1,B0058OR3VM,"The other reviews were completely accurate but unfortunately I hadn't read
them before purchasing this at my grocery store. Adele is not the problem.  The problem is the
""production"" crew if there even was one. I agree with the other reviewers that quite possibly
these were amateurs who found these ""interviews"" on YouTube and then copied them onto a DVD.
Adele even looked skeptical with their lame and repetitive questions. The sound, lighting and setting are sub par as well. The DVD cover looked slick, but this DVD is a joke. I am going to try to return it...",1319414400,10,565,4.707070707070707
8462063,1,B0058OR3VM,"I am a huge Adele Fan and this DVD was a complete dissapointmemt.  There's no music, or videos.  The Quality of the interviews is bad,  like watching them in You Tube.",1319328000,14,167,4.32258064516129
8462064,1,B0058OR3VM,"This video is no good.  It is only three videos probably taken from You Tube.  It has one written page telling about her awards, and another written page saying she is a female and from Great Britain.  My advice is not to buy this video.  I am an Adele fan, this video was a let down.",1318723200,21,284,4.017857142857143
8462065,4,B0058OR3VM,Very few singers have a voice that can transform every song they sing into something special but Adele is certainly in that category. Her range on 21 is incredible through conveying every emotive word with feeling and soul to pitching a tempo akin to some of the all time Motown greats. Fire & Rain is a very nice documentary with fantastic interviews. It is the only Adele DVD on the market so you should buy this for your collection!,1317686400,,435,4.518987341772152
