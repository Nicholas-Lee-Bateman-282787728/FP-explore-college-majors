Upon inspection of the item.  It appeared to be in pristine condition and ready for someone with a DVD player encoded by the correct region.  I hope this DVD gets sold to a wonderful home.

As to the movie:  The first movie is laugh out loud funny even for me today.  (I found a US formatted version.)  The sequel (didn't come with the US version I found) as I recall wasn't as funny, but I remember finishing the movie in a lighter mood having enjoyed my viewing of it.",1391558400,,642,4.231404958677686
