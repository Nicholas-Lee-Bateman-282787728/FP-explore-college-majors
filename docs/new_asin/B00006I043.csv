He also uses some other simple elements that help the children to better understand the story.
Another plus is the high quality that they have used to make those DVDs especially considering the time in which it was released.
Also search for BEN HUR animated excellent for the whole family, but especially for kids to better understand honor and the value of a true friendship.",1426982400,,642,4.640350877192983

7969061,4,B00006I043,"You can't go wrong with this when the price is so low. The animation quality is like that typically seen in basic Saturday morning cartoons, which is good enough for kids. What I like is that all the videos in this series give all the important details of the story, rather than giving a shallow, watered-down version as is usually the case in children's stories. These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. Each video is 45-50 minutes long, and this double feature has two such videos on the disc. The only reason I didn't give this series a 5 is that each video has a hokey song that could definitely have been left out, but for such a low price and good script, I can overlook that.",1121990400,22,762,4.489208633093525
