8110052,5,B000EHSVJQ,My kids love this movie and so do I.  The characters are delightful.  They are caring and polite and I love the Australian accents.  I choose this movie for long car rides because I don't get tired of hearing the upbeat encouraging message it sends to my kids.  I would recommend this to anyone with young preschool-age children.,1249948800,,329,4.620689655172414
8110053,5,B000EHSVJQ,We love them. If you buy a Koala Brothers movie you can never go wrong.  They have a moral to their stories and they show how friends live together in a community.  They show good and bad behaviour in a kid friendly way.  They have the wonderful Helping Song too.  One of our favourites.,1246924800,,287,4.2592592592592595
