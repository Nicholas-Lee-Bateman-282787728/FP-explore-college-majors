7934898,4,B00005A1TY,"Charlotte's first concert video had her playing at the Brixton Academy in the UK.  That was fine, she was full of poise and confidence for a pre-teenager.  In doing a concert in Jerusalem, she nearly retains the same poise.  No, her vocalizations are perfect;  it's inbetween songs that she talks at a clip, belying an apparent nervousness at playing at the Tower of David.  After all, it's a very historic site, and maybe the awe that place inspires got to her.  Fortunately for her, she doesn't sing as fast as she talks, otherwise this would be a short video, plus it might've been retitled The Chipmunk In Jerusalem.  But it's okay--she turned to full form by the time the Enchantment concert in Cardiff was filmed.
Seriously though, all but four songs are taken from Charlotte's self-titled sophomore release.  The first of the two is the song she leads off with, ""Jerusalem,"" part of the epic written by poet William Blake, which begins, ""And did these feet in ancient times, walk upon England's mountain green.""
One of Charlotte's little speeches involves her favourite instrument, the Uillean pipes, which has a sound like a bagpipe except less shrill, and which has been used by Enya and the Corrs, to name at least two Celtic artists.  Uri Miles was the only Uillean pipe player they could find in Jerusalem, and he plays on ""The Last Rose Of Summer"" after giving the crowd a brief demonstration.  Hey, at least it floated Charlotte's boat.
There are two intermissions here.  During the first, the orchestra playing selections from Georges Bizet's Carmen is intercut with silent footage of preparations for the concert, including soundmen, light people, choreographer, the orchestra, Charlotte of course, and Marina Blumen, who comes out briefly later.  In the second, the orchestra plays the Intermezzo Cavalleria Rusticana, while footage of Charlotte walking the streets of the city, wearing a blue dress and purple headscarf, and ordinary citizens of Jerusalem are seen.
Her signature tune ""Pie Jesu"" is done with Marina Blumen, and here we see the use of second banana done to a tee.  Charlotte's clearly the glamorous star, slender, pretty, wearing her sleeveless magenta dress, and having a superior singing voice while Marina, round-faced, taller, a pit on the portly side and wearing a black outfit, pales beside her, vocally as well.  Paging Gwillem Evans... (the kid who duetted with her on the first concert video).
She ends her set appropriately enough with ""The Holy City,"" which she reprises the last verse as an encore.  She is clearly at her best and most radiant here.
The Ra'anana Symphonette Orchestra led by Julian Smith do a bang on job, as do the Cantus Choir when they back her up in ""The Lord's Prayer"" and ""Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer,"" which is one of the better songs here.
However, the lighting isn't anything to shout home about, and she could've done a few more songs that used the choir more.  One other oddity.  Despite sporting nice long-sleeved pink dress on the video cover, she never wears it during the concert.  Other than that, her voice is perfect, even if her rapid-fire talking gets a bit distracting.",1072310400,7,3157,4.902255639097745
7934899,5,B00005A1TY,"Charlotte Church spreads her wings... HIGH in the sky as he sings at the ever History place... in the Holy Land to film her wonderfully done live show. Not much to say on this but ""Hey it's Charlotte Chruch and she is a great singer!",1028937600,6,233,4.2
7934900,1,B00005A1TY,"I was asked to do this review by a friend who had inquired as to whether this Video constituted a great religious experience.  Unfortunately, I finished viewing this video, obtained from a library, totally unmoved.  Despite various venues in and around places associated with Jesus, the vocals from Charlotte Church were about as inspiring as a flat tire.  There is a total lack of emotion with this little girl and her range is notibly lacking; especially at the lower octaves.  There is an aura of sterility that surrounds her vocalizations.  In viewing this video, I feel as if I were listening to vocals which have simply been added to some video shoots without any thought of the congruency between the two.  Thus, I remain unmoved by this work which rates no more than a travelogue seen on the travel TV Channel.",1012348800,81,818,4.76595744680851
7934901,1,B00005A1TY,"This video certainly has no more merit than a CD by this artist.  The scene is by the wailing wall in Jerusalem and the sum total of the program is to hear Miss Church wailing away with her choir-girl repertoire of material from previous CDs.  Accordingly the listener/viewer has the same problems as with the CD and that is the total lack of range, control, and emotion in Miss Church's singing.  If all you want is volume, you can receive the same every Sunday from your church choir.  If you want to see Jerusalem, go there in person.  The stationary night-time scene of Miss Church by the wailing wall will not satisfy your appetite for a Holy Land visitation.",1012348800,85,664,4.546218487394958
7934902,5,B00005A1TY,"I have been a fan of Ms. Church's since she was eleven years old. I think that this video really brings out the best of her angelic talent.  Well done, Charlotte!",989107200,8,162,4.225806451612903
