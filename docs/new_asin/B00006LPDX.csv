1785546,2,B00006LPDX,"""Blood of the Vampires"" is a dreadful horror flick set in nineteenth century Mexico, but made in the Philippines with an all Filipino cast. The acting, direction, film quality, and casting are absolutely bottom of the barrel. When black actors are called for, they simply put blackface on Filipinos thinking the audience isn't smart enough to notice.

The film starts at a large dinner party with dancing in a big old spooky house. There's a romantic subplot about the engagement of the main character to be married to the daughter of Seor Escodero. Note that the scenes of intimacy are more than a bit wooden, like all the rest of the acting here. The family patriarch is also dying in another subplot that festers on and off for the duration of the movie (with a terrifically unbelievable resolution near the end.) In fact, there's no end of pathetic attempts at dramatic subplots which go nowhere, but the film focuses on the fact that Seor Escodero's wife is a vampire locked in the basement of the house. When the kids find out there is no end of trouble, and no end of vampiritic activities. Unfortunately it's sometimes hard to tell what's going on for two primary reasons: first, the quality of the film is relatively poor; and second, the dubbing is absolutely horrendous. Remember, English is the third language of the film.

Watching the unvarnished of this film warrants a single star, but I have decided on a two star rating in the event you see a copy of the Cinematic Titanic version of the movie (which is highly recommended), as the commentary makes it much more palatable; then again, any change would make this film more palatable.",1242086400,2,1650,4.7456445993031355
1785547,5,B00006LPDX,"This is by far the best vampire movie I have nEVER seen! I don't understand these other reviews at all. If you want true terror, nostalgic goth and melancholic cemetery scenes.

Ghosts with depth and character support one of the finest vampire renditions ever. This movie is for you! The love scenes were not chick flick in the least and moved me to tears when I was lost in the characters and realizing my own flailing mortality.

GOD I wish I was a vampire!!",1137628800,11,460,4.464285714285714

7971844,4,B00006LPDX,"Reminds you of what the word gothic means . Commentator Sam Sherman  view that the native film industry and actors are much underrated seems vindicated . This is an old film depending on good acting and  the art of making films , not on special effects  nor on a vampires philosophical or gentle side . In short , and certainly with the mother vampire who starts it all, once they have turned , vampires are not very nice people .",1493078400,,430,4.35

7971851,3,B00006LPDX,"...Or, so screams the tag-line for BLOOD OF THE VAMPIRES, the nearly bloodless epic from the Philippines. Actually, the movie is more of a love story w/ a ghost and a few vampires running around. I'm a big fan of the BLOOD ISLAND movies, so I was sufficiently prepared for cheeeze, but the overall dullness of BOTV is almost coma-inducing! It was OK, but I'm in no hurry to watch it again...",1325203200,2,391,4.444444444444445
7971852,2,B00006LPDX,"I saw this movie by way of CINEMATIC TITANIC and the way they riff on it,it's pretty funny. This has the look and feel of a good vampire movie,but what ruins it is that you have Filipino actors pretending to be Mexican. Filipino actors in black face. Bad dubbing. Why does the lead actor(Eddie Garcia,I think)let his mom(who is a vampire in the basement)bite him on the neck?? How come you can see his reflection in the mirror when he's a vampire?? How come the vampires don't fly away towards the end when the castle is burning?? There are probably more questions to ask,but I think you get the point. All in all,kind of entertaining in a cheesy way,but don't you expect something a little bit more out of your Filpino vampire movies??Well,maybe not..",1252886400,,752,4.619402985074627
