8734725,5,B015VGN14O,"This anime is amazing and one of the best ones I seen. It's one of those type animes that keep you watching and not wanting to stay. There is lots of action, drama, and yes gore. But at the same time the story doesnt skip out on crafting a strong story line the builds and the characters are well developed. There actually times where I was wanted to cry and there times where I would say ""What the..."" in certain scenes.

The artwork of the anime is stunning as well. I think the person created it is amazing and news how to create a work of art. The soundtrack with the anime is also great and it's one of those instances where the anime and the music work perfectly. In fact throughout the time of watching Attack on Titan, I listened to the soundtrack when I'm not. I replayed the openings and ending over and over. It's that good. For those who haven't seen the anime give it a go before the next season comes. The links to the anime is below.",1443571200,,948,4.208791208791209
