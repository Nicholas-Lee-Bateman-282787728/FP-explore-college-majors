2089198,3,B0002F6B8I,"This seems to be an ok learning video but it's not catching my 7 years old's, who struggles with maths, attention. I still have hope it will happen.",1362268800,2,148,4.321428571428571
2089199,3,B0002F6B8I,I would put 5 Stars if include Closed Captions. But kids love it and learned a lot. If this company update add closed captions i will buy all dvds no doubt about it.,1357084800,,165,4.03030303030303
2089200,5,B0002F6B8I,"My kids can't get enough of these videos.  My son I've been homeschooling since he was 4 and isn't even in Kindergarten yet, however he's in 1st grade Math.  These videos are partly responsible.  After teaching they do some equations with a few seconds wait time, waiting for the kids to answer back.  I watch with my kids and make it into a contest.  (Sometimes pretending I'm really bad at math) and they love it!  They are so proud when they can should the answer before anyone else.  I also own Phonics 1 & 2, Time, and money.  Rock N Learn, you rock!",1356998400,7,555,4.320388349514563
2089201,3,B0002F6B8I,"My son is 6, and this held his attention for all of about 10 minutes.  The characters and songs are just geared toward a much younger audience, IMO.  The drawback there is that you would have to have a younger child who is ready for math for this to really make sense.",1355961600,2,268,4.134615384615385
2089202,5,B0002F6B8I,This is a great DVD for my classroom and my children at home.  It is engaging and teaches at the same time.,1352419200,4,107,3.8636363636363638
2089203,2,B0002F6B8I,This video is annoying and music and math goes too fast to really learn the math tables.  Probably ok for review but not a good teaching video.  Very disappointed.,1345939200,,163,4.586206896551724
2089204,1,B0002F6B8I,THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT VIDEO FOR THIS ISBN NUMBER. WHEN PEOPLE LIST ITEMS INCORRECTLY IT MAKES LISTING THE CORRECT ITEM MORE DIFFICULT.,1344384000,,136,4.956521739130435
2089205,4,B0002F6B8I,"I was looking for something to reinforce our addition facts to make sure my son had all of them down.  Amazon did not have a clip to view a sample so I went to youtube.  My son was interested in the cartoon characters and the colorful way the facts were presented.  I like the addition rock better for the slower pace and music but he liked the addition rap better since the cartoon characters caught his attention.  He will even watch it himself and since he is very visual this is a great learning tool.  I like that it includes the subtraction too.  Another good feature is the way they break them into groups.  Facts to sum of 5, then 10, so it is in smaller groups. I've looked for a dvd for a while and this is a good one.  It is entertaining and since flashcards are boring to him, this is a nice alternative.",1340668800,31,816,4.185897435897436
2089206,5,B0002F6B8I,"I bought this DVD last spring to use in my first grade classroom.  I use it for motivation during math-if we get everything done that we need to get done, then we can have the last 10 or 15 minutes of math time to watch the DVD.  The kids LOVE it.  They have already learned how to add and subtract but we will continually review our facts from now until the end of the year.  The kids are really into the characters, which remind me of animated versions of the new Alvin and the Chipmunks.  The songs get progressively harder as the DVD goes on and it's easy to pick just the segments that you want from the menu screen.  This has been a great addition to our math curriculum!",1293494400,40,677,4.1692307692307695

2089250,2,B0002F6B8I,"We love Rock 'n Learn. We own a Sight Words DVD and a Letter Sounds DVD but I wasn't at all impressed with this one. Neither were my kids. Where the phonics/grammar DVDs are provide engaging opportunities with the characters, games, and questions, this DVD merely sings (raps) math problems at them. There isn't anything that grab enough to hold attention and though there is rhythm, it isn't rhythmic enough to help with memorization if that makes sense. I'd save your money on this one and go for what they seem to do best, Phonics and Grammar.",1456963200,,546,4.639175257731959

2089270,1,B0002F6B8I,"The child hated it immediately.  She was repulsed by the bearded character with the blue sunglasses  and would not give it a chance.  I'll just give it to a boy.  Maybe boys like this stuff.  I was equally repulsed by the voice, demeanor an appearance of the ugly animal character with the blue glasses.",1436572800,,303,4.537037037037037

2089290,5,B0002F6B8I,"We enjoy using this as a review tool in the car.  It gets a little repetitive to just sit in the livingroom and watch, but it's ideal for the car or the kids like to dance to the music.  The menu tool doesn't work very well, but if we eject and reinsert the disc, that always takes care of it.",1405728000,3,293,3.8666666666666667
2089291,5,B0002F6B8I,My grandson is a little young for this on-almost 4-but he soaks up everything and loves the DVD.  It is like a memory exercise of simple math facts.,1402617600,,148,4.285714285714286

I am surprised she picked up so quick.",1387152000,,97,3.9

2089315,4,B0002F6B8I,Pretty cheesy.  My kids learn well through song so it's pretty good for that.  Not super entertaining for kids who might watch a lot of tv or video games.,1384214400,2,154,4.275862068965517

2089317,1,B0002F6B8I,The rapping is terrible!!!  You can hardly understand what they are rapping.  The lyrics and music are not engaging.  Should have bought the other one with Tad.,1377734400,2,160,4.851851851851852
2089318,4,B0002F6B8I,"My daughter is in Kinder.  This is advanced for her, but would be perfect for a 1st grader. My daughter loves the music, she just looses attention toward the end when it gets more advanced.",1375056000,2,189,4.4

2089321,1,B0002F6B8I,"bought this for my 4 y/o who tells me she wants to know her math b4 starting kindergarten...I was hoping this would have some kind of intro to basic math concepts, but to my disappointment, all I see is a bunch of drills (ie this plus this is that, this plus this is that...); how's a kid supposed to know WHY, why is 1+2 = 3, why is 2 + 2 = 4...no rhyme or rhythm at all to this video, just constant, non-stop drilling of random numbers, adding and subtracting them...I don't want my kid to just memorize math, she needs to know the concept so she can add ANY number, not just the ones shown in the video...",1368921600,,608,4.075
