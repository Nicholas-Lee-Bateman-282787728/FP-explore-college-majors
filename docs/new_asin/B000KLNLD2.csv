8158141,4,B000KLNLD2,"Volume One in this series features three early editions in the long-running Football Follies series by NFL Films --

01.  Football Follies
  (aka ""They Call it Pro Football"")
02.  Son of the Football Follies
03.  Football Follies Go Hollywood

There's no beating the orignal ""Football Follies.""  But ""Go Hollywood,"" where the NFL is compared to movie productions, comes close.  ""Son of the Football Follies,"" even with guest narrator Mel Blanc, never really tripped my funny-bone.  Besides, about halfway through, Blanc disappears and gives way to classic NFL Films announcer, John Facenda.  It just seemed disjointed to me.  In any case, all three of these oldies have been beautifully re-done for DVD.  My only real gripe?  No bonus material.  C'mon Steve Sabol ... give it up for the people!",1217203200,6,794,5.09375
