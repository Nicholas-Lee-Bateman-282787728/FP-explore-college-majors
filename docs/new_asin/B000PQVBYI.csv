8192943,4,B000PQVBYI,"This Danish comedy from 2005 filmed around Copenhagen is an amusing piece involving bride to be Anne (Louise Mieritz) who has just started her own wedding arrangement business ""The Big Day"". A high profile wedding is needed to give the business the much needed boost it needs, and Anne is keen to land the hosts of Danish TV2's breakfast programme Anders (Nikolaj Steen) and Signe (Trine Dyrholm) for their wedding and stops at nothing in her quest to get it.
The 90 minute film is entirely in Danish with English subtitles throughout is enjoyable, but I particularly missed seeing the odd appearance from performers who have appeared in recent DR (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) TV dramas. Probably the best known of the cast is Trine Dyrholm who has numerous films under her belt, many of them available on amazon.
Fine performances by all the cast ensure that I kept with this enjoyable tale through to the end. It's not the best Danish film I've seen and not the worst.
