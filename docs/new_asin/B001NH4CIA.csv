3718942,5,B001NH4CIA,"Apparently, L'Innocente is Visconti's last film. It has a delightful care for detail, that is a trademark of Visconti's. The story is a very interesting nineteen century ""feuilleton"", with reflections on the decadence of that very italian mixture of bourgeois-arsitocrats, in which scepticism about the possibilities of being human ( or rich bourgeois) are elaborated to their utmost consequences. This is a topic that is recurrent in Visconti's oeuvre, and in my view shows his obsession with the decadence of an entire world, but these ruminations are very actual today also. The performances of Giancarlo Gianninni an Laura Antonelli are  very good. However, the american actress (I forgot her name) who is very beautiful, has the voice dubbed, and in general I found her performance poor.
This film impacted me not only for its exquisiteness, but for the different levels of meaning, especially the existencial despair of the main character, immersed in a world of opulence and consumption - la XIX century, and the appalling machismo that permeates that society. The photography is impeccable and beautiful. The last scene is memorable in its desolate loneliness and beauty.",1279411200,,1179,5.304812834224599
3718943,5,B001NH4CIA,"The theme of the adultery capitalized the attention of the literary universe during and at the end of the romantic era. Let's take a look around it. First, Germany with Goethe with ""The elective affinities"" and Theodor Fontane's ""Effie Briest""; from Russia, Leon Tolstoi with ""Anna Karenina""; from England Thomas Hardy with ""Tess"", and while France would propose Gustave Flaubert's""Madame Bovary"", Italy threw D'Annunzio to the ring.

The visual splendor, aristocratic flair, inimitable panache, superb photography and accurate direction of Luchino Visconti, allowed him to undertake this so many times told before dramatis personae into a resplendent gem. During four decades (Obsessione better known like ""The postman always rings twice"", 1941; Rocco and his brothers, in the late fifties, Il gatopardo in 1963, made of him to be capable to strive and win with the most acclaimed quartet of films a director has been capable to undertake. These were indeed, ""The fall of the Gods"", ""Death at Venice"", ""Ludwig"" and finally ""The innocent"". His polite clat has exerted visible influences specially on two directors of Italian ancestors, Coppola ""The Godfather"" and Scorsesse ""The age of innocence"".

Based on the celebrated Gabriel D' Annunzio's novel, placed on Tuscan, where the fall begins to appear. Tulio (Giancarlo Gianini) and Giuliana (Laura Antonelli) have a weird way of living, who leaves them with absolute liberty to make what they want. But the things turn harder when she realizes is pregnant of another man. And despite he has a very beautiful mistress, The Countess Raffo (starred by the alluring Jennifer O' Neil), the very fact she gives birth to a child of another man becomes more and more unbearable for both of them, leading to a tragedy of unthinkable proportions.

A marvelous cast complements this extraordinary movie (One of the four best Italian films during the seventies, Ernano Olmi's ""Tree of the wooden clogs"", Taviani brothers' ""Padre Padrone"" and Bertolucci's ""Novecento"") but is the unforgettable performance of Gianini (only surpassed by ""Seven beauties"") what truly confers the film the expected jewel of the crown. A masterwork that definitively may not absent in your invaluable collection.

This was his swam's song.",1267401600,,2256,5.328651685393258
3718944,5,B001NH4CIA,"Italian director Visconti is well knows for his beautiful films, powerful stories about class and italian sensibilities.  He has impeccable taste that shows it in every little detail, from music, to clothes to the interior design of the most beautiful italian houses and villas.

Set in 19th century, this is a story of a married couple who experiences their marriage turning more and more distant.  While maintaining emotionally distant between each other and sleeping in separate bedrooms, husband gives himself a freedom to have a very public affair with a beautiful and rich high society widow.  Wife, on the other hand, supported by loyal family and friends lives a quiet and seemingly subdued life not resisting her husband wishes to enjoy his open marriage in its fullness.

When one day it becomes apparent that wife is pregnant with another man's child their relationship changes instantaneosly.  Keeping the truth secret from friends and family they choose not to disclose that child is not his for the sake of their marriage.  Secretly husband hopes that the wife will loose this child as she did their own during early days of their marriage together.  It is at that point that we fully understand the reasons for their previous estrangement.

But as the true father of the child dies in Africa during his military mission, husband becomes obsessed that his wife's love for the father of her child will transfer to the child himself and he will loose her and their life and future together.  He is determined to remain in control of their life together at all cost.  His resolve is unthinkable and leads to the utter disaster for all involved.  I have not seen such visually pleasing film in a long time and it is almost impossible to believe that the film was made more than 30 years ago.",1244678400,5,1801,4.830618892508143
3718945,5,B001NH4CIA,"This is the final film of Italy's grandest, most operatic filmmaker (and still underrated) Luchino Visconti.  For years, this film was really hard to find.  It was only available in lousy, faded VHS copies, some of them pan and scan, others in the wrong aspect ratio.  Now Koch Lorber has put it out in a wonderful, luxurious transfer, and in its orignal 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

This film is so rich visually that you could just watch it once without the sound, and marvel at the cinematography (by longtime Visconti colloberator Pasqualino de Santis) or at the production design, which is drop dead gorgeous.  The music score is incredibly haunting and sad, much like Visconti's superlative use of music in his film of Death in Venice.  The performances are also striking.  Giancarlo Giannini, known to most film buffs from his hilarious performances in Lina Wertmueller's classic films, gives a fine dramatic performance here, completely believable, and there was no time while watching this film did I think of his comic performances.  He's an excellent dramatic actor.  Jennifer O'Neil, who is best known for Summer of '42, is excellent as the beautiful but vile mistress of Gianni.  Laura Antonelli, who plays Giannini's wife, gives the deepest performance of the woman who is scorned by Giannini, but exacts a revenge on him that is heartbreaking and tragic.

The film is beautifully paced, very leisurely, and visually intoxicating.  Visconti was incapacitated by a stroke while making this film, but you wouldn't know it from watching it.  Even though he was ill, Luchino never lost his touch, and his artistry/genius shines through every frame here, from the opening credits sequence (which features Visconti's own hand turning pages of the book L'Innocente) to the final, haunting still shot of O'Neil.  It's a great final film (even though an artist never intends any work to be their ""final"" one), and a masterpiece from arguably the most complex of the Italian greats.",1243468800,31,1979,5.067901234567901
3718946,4,B001NH4CIA,"""L'Innocente"" was the final film from Italian director, Luchino Visconti, and stands up to his greatest achievements.  Laura Antonelli, one of the most alluring stars of 70s Italian cinema, stars as Giuliana Hermil, a beautiful aristocrat who is ignored by her philandering husband, Tullio (Giancarlo Giannini).  Everywhere Giuliana goes, she is confronted by the most recent of her husband's conquests, the sensual Teresa Raffo (Jennifer O'Neill).  After being embarrassed once too often, Giuliana decides to turn the tables and make her husband jealous.  However, she underestimates the power of her plan as well as her husband's passion for her, which results in mounting tragedies.

Adapted from the 1892 novel by Gabriele d'Annunzio, the script for ""The Innocent"" is extremely good, with Giuliana's revenge beautifully plotted.  At times, it's difficult to tell her intentions, but that doesn't really distract from the story.  The cast is also one of the most stunning looking in history - Antonelli, O'Neill, and Giannini are joined by doe-eyed Didier Haudepin as Giannini's younger brother (he starred 12 years earlier in the notorious French film, ""This Special Friendship"").  Their physical beauty rivals the sumptuous Italian villas and scenery with which Visconti populates the film.

I'm not sure why it took until 2009 for this near-masterpiece to be released on DVD, but fortunately they did a nice job.  The film looks gorgeous.  The subtitles are a bit verbose which makes them go by very quickly (I sometimes had to pause to read all of them), but we do get every delicious word of the screenplay.  The extras are limited to an interview on Italian cinema with Suso Cecchi d'Amico, a long-time Visconti collaborator who co-wrote ""L'Innocente.""",1240704000,46,1761,5.294964028776978

3718951,5,B001NH4CIA,"I enjoy this glorious movie over and over, but it's not D'Annunzio's book. Visconti has used the skeleton of L'Innocente to tell Visconti's story which is a kind of Classic Comic book version of the psychological novel based on the philosophy of Nietzsche.  Tullio's suicide in the movie is Visconti's judgment, not D'Annunzio's.  D'Annunzio's (and Nietzsche's) Uebermenschen are outside of judgment  They don't kill themselves.  Neither is the book Giuliana's revenge log.

In the book, a much alive but agonizing Tullio is confessing his secret crime on the first anniversary of the child's murder. He could go before a judge but he can not and will not. ""Non posso ne voglio.""  He only wants a listener.  ""Man's justice does not touch me.  No tribunal on earth would know how to judge me. . . .I need to tell my secret to someone but to whom?""  And that ""whom"" is the reader who should be thinking of one of D'Annunzio's literary heroes, Dostoyevsky. And if the reader were in Italy in 1892 when the book was published, he/she would note while reading, that Tullio's adultery situation follows pretty closely that of D'Annunzio's most current. In fact, some Italian critics describe this book as more autobiography than romanzo.

Because of Italian inheritance laws and the construction of Tulio's family, the newborn, Raimondo, named after Tullio's father, but not of Tullio's blood, will inherit Tullio's estate.  Tullio and Guiliana have two girls and Tullio's Tolstoy-like brother is childless. The assumed father of the newborn is suffering from what is described as bulbar paralysis (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's Disease) but the symptoms could also belong to those of syphilis. Both diseases can be hereditary. Consequently, the ""purity of blood"" idea becomes twisted into Tullio's insane rationale for committing his horrible act. Exposure is a manner of infanticide that goes back to the ancient Greeks.

I'm not alone in my sorrow that D'Annunzio's work for whatever reasons is not translated into English. Yes, he was a fascist but can't we get over that? After all, he died in 1938. His work in theater, prose and poetry provides many superlative examples of the decadent/symbolist school and, furthermore, he's an interesting character. Strange that in light of the continuing importance of Nietzsche's philosophy, English-only readers miss out on, perhaps, the best literary examples of his philosophy.

At any rate, none of the above lessens my enjoyment of the movie nor should it yours.  Just be advised that this is not D'Annunzio's book.",1344211200,5,2576,5.146282973621103
3718952,3,B001NH4CIA,"L' INNOCENTE

A movie by Luchino Visconti starring Giancarlo Giannini & Laura Antonelli. Though many other characters appear in the movie, none of them is given enough to do to seem living people. Giannini & Antonelli are superb in their portrayals of the parts they have, yet only Antonelli really seems a believable person. This is the prime source of my dissatisfaction with this movie.

The plotline develops along a foreseeable path & moves too slowly at times. The finale is hard to accept in any vein other than as a just reward. There was plenty of ambiguity in the moral stance of the movie for better plot development & I felt it was a waste of a good cast. The title of the show applies to a cast member with the least of all to do in the movie. I felt it was an error to title the movie after that character. It's true a great wrong was perpetrated on this cast member by the two principles but as you never have a chance to identify with the character that was betrayed in the most vile manner you are left searching for a different reason for the movies existence. That is supplied by the substitution of a self inflicted wound on the least likable character in the cast.

Still, the show does raise questions about marriage, infidelity, commitment & the old theme of sex having a double standard for women (still in force today) as opposed to men. It also has Laura Antonelli in truly classical nude scenes & what a stunning beauty she is. She wears an unflattering hair-do throughout the movie & this of course accents her beauty in the nude scenes.

The settings are well-done, the scenes don't spend a lot of time on traveling which helps the pacing & it needed it. In general none of the problems displayed by the storyline are neatly wrapped up & the ones that are seem to be more for convenience than anything else. All in all an average movie that could have been much better. 2.5 Amazon stars for the show. 5+ stars for Laura Antonelli's acting & beauty.",1329091200,,1977,4.468144044321329
3718953,5,B001NH4CIA,"A torrid tragedy? A turgid travesty? A lurid melodrama? I've never read Gabrielle D'Annunzio, from whose 1892 novel L'Innocente this film was scripted, but I suspect the scriptwriters have been devoutly faithful to the author. The film is torrid, lurid, melodramatic, and tragic enough for the most romance-obsessed viewer, and yet it also rather sardonically depicts a moral travesty. The consequences of Love -- passionate Love, Eros rather than Agape -- are disastrous: cruelty, immorality, betrayal, murder, and suicide. Yes sirree, it's a red velvet, diamond-choker, bodice-ripper of a melodrama. Since I haven't read D'Annunzio, I don't know how stylish his writing was, but the plot of this film could be handled very neatly in a Harlequin Romance. It's also a bit of a skin flick, with righteously torrid scenes between Laura Antonelli (the neglected wife) and Giancarlo Giannini (the neglectful husband whose concupiscence is re-invigorated by jealousy). Antonelli is gorgeous, but her 'rival' Jennifer O'Neill (Tullio's mistress) is even more gorgeous, wherefore one could complain that she isn't given equal uncoverage in the film.

Oh, it is a gorgeous film. The salons and boudoirs of the elite effete of Italian wealth and 'family' are sumptuously photographed. The costumes of the ladies wafting their beauty like potent perfumes through those salons are delectable to the eyes. Life among the aristocracy of the late 19th C was, it seems, deliciously lax and lazy ... and I wish I'd been there! Gabrielle D'Annunzio was prolific, flamboyant, an adventurer and aviator, and a devout voluptuary, so there has to be an intended ambiguity in the film's portrayal of the husband Tullio, in that Tullio's expressed values are exactly what d'Annunzio manifested, yet Tullio's fate implies the inevitable failure of those values.

D'Annunzio was fabulously popular as a writer but his career extended into politics and social agitation. He was an immense influence on the thinking and the behavior of Benito Mussolini; it's said the Mussolini modeled his public image on a character from a d'Annunzio novel. """"D'Annunzio has been described as the John the Baptist of Italian Fascism, as virtually the entire ritual of Fascism was invented by D'Annunzio during his occupation of Fiume and his leadership of the Italian Regency of Carnaro. These included the balcony address, the Roman salute, the cries of 'Eia, eia, eia! Alala!', the dramatic and rhetorical dialogue with the crowd, the use of religious symbols in new secular settings. It also included his economics of the corporate state; stage tricks; large emotive nationalistic public rituals; blackshirted followers with their disciplined, bestial responses and strong-arm repression of dissent.""""  One of D'Annunzio's most revealing novels  is Il Fuoco  of 1900, in which he portrays himself as the ""Nietzschean"" Superman Stelio Effrena, in a fictionalized account of his love affair with Eleonora Duse.

And there we have it again, the Romantic cult of the Exceptional Individual, the World Hero, the man superior to the morality of and indifferent to the welfare of the 'common horde' of humanity. D'Annunzio was indisputably the Ayn Rand of his land and language.

But hey, let's not hold THAT against this voluptuous film by the brilliant Italian director Luchino Visconti. In fact, Visconti's keen eye for the repulsiveness and emptiness of D'Annunzio's ""beautiful people"" is what saves this film from being mere over-ripe escapism. Pay attention, if you watch it, to the dignity and disapproval of the servants in those salons. They're the monitors of sanity and decency in this lascivious culture.",1323302400,11,3670,5.350086655112651
3718954,5,B001NH4CIA,"The DVD of the Luchino Visconti film titled ""L'Innocente""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Innocente/dp/B001NH4CIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Innocente</a>&nbsp;and produced by Koch-Lorber has a surprisingly good DIGITAL restoration of this film recorded in the 1970's.  It is also the full 127-minute version, not the shorter 112-minute version (which I think is the edited American version that has a few scenes of minimal male and female nudity deleted).  The dubbing (in Italian) of Jennifer O'Neil's voice, however, was NOT great.  She plays the role of the mistress to the rich Italian aristocrat who is the main character in the film.  I think (contrary to some other reviewers) that Jennifer was quite good.  On the other hand, the other actors were TERRIFIC, but then, they speak in Italian (likely their native tongue), while Jennifer, whose lips you can read, speaks her lines in English and her voice is DUBBED in Italian.  Reminded me of another really great film by the same Italian director, Luchino Visconti, titled ""The Leopard""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Leopard-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B004M66YUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Leopard (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Leopard-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003D3Y660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Leopard (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>], with Burt Lancaster, who plays an Italian aristocrat also, but older and wiser, even if somewhat less attractive.  The main actor in L'Innocent portrays a younger and perhaps more physically / sexually appealing aristocrat.  In the Criterion version of ""The Leopard,"" Burt Lancaster speaks his lines in English, while the rest of the cast speak in Italian! Oddly enough however, in ""L'Innocente"", I thought the audio track made all the actors' voices sound as though they had been added in; the audio just doesn't sound the way I'm accustomed to hearing voices in a film.  The Criterion editions (both the regular DVD and the Blu-ray versions) of ""The Leopard"" offer an Italian audio track as well as one in which you hear Lancaster speaking his lines in English.  The version in which Lancaster speaks in English is, to my taste, MUCH better that the dubbed Italian version!  This is where Criterion shines above Koch-Lorber, as least with regard to effort put into viewing and listening options, but then again one PAYS a much higher price for Criterion versions that have those options!

The picture quality, when viewed on a DVD player with upgrading ability (I used a SONY Blu-ray player), is EXCELLENT, but the sound (as I mentioned above) doesn't fare quite as well, but that did not detract from my appreciation of the film.  The film's story and eventual outcome definitely linger long after viewing.  I think one of the tragedies in the story is the revelation of this rich man's particularly sad interpretation of life.

There was no commentary (which I would have thoroughly appreciated), but there was an interesting interview with the film's screenwriter (Suso Cecchi d'Amico).  Although the interview did not shed much information on the film, it did go into how she became a screenwriter, and that was ""ok.""

CAUTION:  If you don't like subtitles, you will not enjoy this film...the only audio track is in Italian (with English subtitles)...even the interview with the film's screenwriter.  Personally, I found myself pausing the disc every now and then to go back to make sure I caught all the subtitle text, because sometimes it just went by too quickly for me.  Thank goodness, however, Koch-Lorber used a yellow color for the subtitles, unlike CRITERION editions that seem always to use a ghostly white-color that becomes literally INVISIBLE in scenes with light or white backgrounds (grrrrr!).

All in all, this is a haunting story, beautifully captured on film and nicely remastered on DVD by Koch-Lorber.  Highly recommended!",1316736000,4,4051,5.795952782462058

I have since re-ordered iit after seeing ""L'Innocente"" at first.  ""L'Innocente was Viisconti's final film and I understand he died before the editing was completed or before it was released, I can't be certain now, but it is generally agreed he directed it from his wheelchair.  He had also directed ""Conversation Piece"" after having had a stroke.  The interview with screenwriter Suso Cecchi D'Amico included on Koch Lorber's DVD is enlightening.  I'm sure she was exhausted afterward, but there was a lot of information to cover and left me with still some questions, but it is something like an upwards of an hour and very good.  The screenplay she wrote with Visconti and Enrico Medioli is brilliant, but I do not know how it adapted Annunzio's original novel faithfully or tailored it more to reflect on Visconti remains to be understood. AKA ""The Intruder"", the theme from the opening credits to Annunzio's book's leaves being turned to the last haunting image speak well and the film remains in your thoughts for a long time afterward, a feat that should be savored when one comes upon such a film.  D'Amico does not speak especially well of ""L'Innocente"" in the interview.  I found all of the performances outstanding, Giancarlo Giannini and Laura Antonelli better than I've ever seen them.  Jennifer O'Neill, although dubbed, is also perfectly cast, giving a rich, textured performance, her best, although it is harder to know from the expert dubbing.  Franco Mannino is the perfect choice to do the music and Pasquale De Santis's cinematography provides Visconti's detail with sumptuousness and well-used Technicolor.  The transfer by Koch Lorber is excellent as usual.  They have come be, in my experience, very reliable for a pleasing experience.  If this is a film diminished by illness, and I suspect that it was, then Luchino Visconti is a true superlative director and one to believe in for his artistry.  I can not say this about any other director who ranks as highest in the annals of film history.  Well worth the inexpensive price.  Thoroughly enjoyed it several times since buying it this week.  I nearly forgot, I did have the privilege of seeing Luchino Visconti's much neglected version of the Camus novel, ""The Stranger"" with an incredible performance by Marcello Mastroianni at Eastertime and remember thinking Visconti extraordinary, but the film, for some reason, perhaps why it took so long for 1976's ""L'Innocente"" to find its way to DVD, a very literal version of the novel and I had been forced to see it dubbed in German with English subtitles, still a sublime witnessing.",1384646400,2,2773,4.980477223427332
