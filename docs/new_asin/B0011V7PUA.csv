8242591,5,B0011V7PUA,I remember playing this game and seeing it in the theatre's back in the day. What a fun movie :),1392681600,,96,3.85
8242592,5,B0011V7PUA,"I played the Booty Call flash games in college (they're still out there) and loved Jake's attitude and the way he talked.  Me and my friends have so many one-liners from the games that it's kind of obnoxious but mostly hilarious.  Watching this movie is pure vicarious entertainment.  You laugh at how direct and sexual Jake is with women and wish you could be too.

The story does not matter at all.  It is all about Jake revisiting territory he did in the games, except it is a passive experience instead of an interactive one.  If this was made into an interactive DVD like the Harold and Kumar 2 Blu-ray, it would be even more amazing than it is!",1366848000,,650,4.420168067226891
8242593,2,B0011V7PUA,"I have seen this movie numerous times on Netflix in the past. I loved it every single time. The music is great!  The experience just was not the same watching this DVD. The sound quality is not good enough. It like I'm missing half the movies, by not being able the hear the music very well in the back ground. Very disappointed.",1350691200,,329,4.306451612903226
8242594,5,B0011V7PUA,"Long time fan of Jake The Pimp. This is a funny movie for teens and adults alike, even women can laugh at this story of a Jedi-Pimp's quest to get his super-dork-loser friend the tit.",1277251200,,183,4.257142857142857
8242595,5,B0011V7PUA,"Jake's Booty Call is one of the best films I have ever seen.  I can't believe I would actually write those words, but I do so for the simple reason that I can't believe this film was actually made.

This film is the male component of Generation Y's world in a nutshell.  It shows our love for music of the 60s, films of the 70s, and the video game revolution of the 80s.  For many males of Generation Y, the whole world was easily accessible by airplane, and for our young men, it was upon foreign soil where many of life's ropes were learned.

From a production standpoint, JBC is amazingly well executed.  The soundtrack is so good it deserves to be released separately; the camerawork and animation seems a labor of love.  I do not believe any corners were cut with this film -- I believe it was produced exactly as the creators imagined it.  I wonder how much of a say the sagely folks of National Lampoon had in its production.

I would guess that many people who see this film will not enjoy it.  BUT, if you happen to fall into the lucky window of being male and born around 1980, plus/minus about 7 years, (or you're interested in knowing what it's like to be from that demographic) I think you will love it.  In that case, you will be amused by and enjoy all the references and imagery from our childhood, plus a great storyline (not hurt in the slightest by the protagonists' goals -- to party and get laid.)  You'll love the visuals and soundtrack, and laugh at the fantastic assortment of slang terms employed (you practically need an urban dictionary to decode everything.)

With all that said, the bottom line is, I am thrilled that this film exists.  It's got lines you'll find only here, and visuals you'll see only here.  It's a completely original treatment of an entire generation's pop culture.  I would give Jake's Booty Call 5 and 1/2 stars if I could.  If you're lucky enough to own this DVD, enjoy it!  If you don't yet own it, it's worth the price of admission!!",1221350400,5,1987,4.426997245179064
8242596,2,B0011V7PUA,As someone who used to play all the episodes on the website I was excited to finally see this movie. Sadly I was very disappointed. The movie is digital and pretty corny. Dont waste your money.,1208131200,,193,4.388888888888889
8242597,5,B0011V7PUA,"If you have played the Jake's Booty Call series of flash games The Romp created, you will enjoy this movie. Just like the games really, it's not the sort of movie you can laugh hard at with a group of people unless you are truly self confident and feel comfortable with whoever is watching it with you- which was probably it's downfall when it was being screened early on in the advertising campaign. I laughed as hard as hell throughout the movie myself, and could easily watch it many times over. Get yourself a JD and coke and sit back 'n relax for this one. If you love Jake's form, you will not be disappointed. If you like a bumpin' soundtrack too, they don't let you down there either. Printz Board's ""Keep It Jumping"" and other awesome tracks make the movie feel truly pimpin.

For those of you who haven't played the games before, I suggest you get into them before watching the movie for maximum appreciation and understanding. Some people just don't get it, since they've never heard of Jake before. For reference, all 33 of them are online at ""Outer Reaches"". Just google them (since I ain't allowed to give you a link).

5 Stars all round. Excellent value from Amazon.com - thanks guys! :D",1205452800,5,1202,4.534562211981567
8242598,5,B0011V7PUA,"This movie is funny as hell...
If you used to visit [...] and play the game you will really appreciate this.  I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in theaters at the limited premier.  This movie is based on real life experience of playas so respect.  The creators have a great sense of humor and anyone down with the lifestyle will get it...so check it out and burn one before you do.",1203811200,4,387,4.273972602739726
