8055964,1,B0008F756O,"This DVD cost 50 cents, and that's about how much it was worth-quality wise.  The color is not restored.  It's faded and irregular.  You can still hear the sound track-thankfully.  It was a nice trip down memory lane to see this show I remember from my childhood, but I was disappointed in the quality.  I'm glad I didn't spend much.",1245715200,,333,4.483333333333333
