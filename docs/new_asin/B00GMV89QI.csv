6087538,2,B00GMV89QI,Stupid movie was not worth my time to watch it and not even worth paying one cent to watch. ?,1395100800,,93,3.7
6087539,1,B00GMV89QI,This a one of the most badly written comedies that I have ever seen... Do not waste your money on this...,1395014400,,105,4.0476190476190474
6087540,3,B00GMV89QI,"This movie was just totally different from the starving games. Funny all the way through out the film, and I decrement it to 15-25 year olds",1394928000,2,140,4.423076923076923
6087541,1,B00GMV89QI,If I could give it no stars I would. Truly a very bad movie and not worth watching. Don't waste your money on this one.,1394841600,,119,3.8
6087542,4,B00GMV89QI,This movie was lots of fun! My spouse and I I enjoyed it. It's destined to become a cult classic.,1394150400,2,97,3.9
6087543,4,B00GMV89QI,"Ok, as with most all ""spoof"" movies, this one has it's good AND bad.  But I gotta say, this one is actually pretty entertaining!  For someone to decide to combine ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Hangover"",...well, that says a bit about those people.  Two of the most opposite movies you could think of being combined into one just seems like a recipe for a total flop, but once again,...it's pretty funny!  Both actors playing Ed (Ben Begley) and Zach (Herbert Russell) could easily replace Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis in The Hangover and you'd never know the difference!  As for Bradley (Ross Nathan) and Doug (John Livingston), it took me a bit to realize which was playing which role.  Not to say they did their roles badly, quite the opposite!  They did really good roles, but didn't look the parts as well as the others did!  Rita Volk as Katnip was another pleasant surprise!  I'd never heard of her before this movie, but I'd like to see her in more movies in the future.  If you can make it to the games (about 15 minutes in) then you'll get some pretty good laughs!  Oddly enough, Bruce Jenner (who I am complete SICK of hearing about) is actually pretty funny in this movie as well.  I was REALLY surprised with that.

If you're thinking about watching it with your kids, then you DEFINITELY need to rethink that parenting decision.  This movie is completely FILTHY!  Filthy in a funny way, but filthy, none the less!  It is what it is.

The movie begins as ""The Hangover"" began with Bradley calling Doug's ""bride"" and saying they lost Doug and they aren't going to make it.  Of course, we cut to flashback and the real story begins.  Bladley, Doug, Zach, and  Ed arrive at the hotel for a bachelor party and Doug makes it perfectly clear they are going to remain SOBER for once, because bad things ALWAYS happen when they go out for a bachelor party.  Obviously things end up taking a turn for the worse and when they awaken the next morning, they find themselves on a train heading for ""The Hungover Games"".  Apparently, in their ""drunken/drugged"" state, they were transported to the future and volunteered as tributes.

Basically, this is were the movie really takes off.  I don't want to ruin it for you, because it's way funnier going in without knowing anything about it.  I would imagine, at least.

All in all, this movie isn't as funny to me as say, ""Not Another Teen Movie"", but that movie also had one specific formula it was following.  This one has MANY!  And I'm sure I'm leaving some stuff out.  This movie completely flew under the radar, but it was well worth it for me!  I enjoyed watching it and at only 1:24, there's enough to keep you watching.

Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  Especially it you're drinking with some friends.

6087544,4,B00GMV89QI,"I'm not a spoof fan and I had little interest in watching this movie, but a friend wanted to see it and it really was quite entertaining. I'm sure our adult beverages helped bump up the humor, but there were a lot of funny parts and it didn't feel like a ton of random crap thrown at the wall like the last few spoofs I've seen. So in conclusion, watch this with friends and drinks and you'll have a fun time!",1392854400,5,409,4.061728395061729

6087549,4,B00GMV89QI,This was a very funny movie. It is a great mix of The hangover and Hunger Games. The actors portrayed their counterparts with many of the same characteristics though highly exaggerated for extra comedic effect. Like many spoof movies there are references to several other movie's characters thrown in to round out the hunger game participants. Not recommended for children since it does contain nudity and sexual situations.,1471392000,,424,5.25
6087550,5,B00GMV89QI,Stupid movie but funny,1471046400,,22,4.75

6087552,4,B00GMV89QI,"Of the hunger games spoofs this one is the best. They draw in elements from many newer movies, and from different genres. The cast is straight from the uncanny vally. Ammong others Ted, the muppets, carrie, django, and of course hunger games and hangover all fall fodder to the parody. This is a movie for the hangover crowd, and less so for the hunger games crowd.",1467504000,,365,4.545454545454546
6087553,1,B00GMV89QI,"Could have been great, but falls short of other parody movies.  All in all, just plain old bad filmmaking.",1461801600,,106,4.578947368421052

6087556,3,B00GMV89QI,"If somebody has watched both The Hunger Games and Hangover, they would probably enjoy this parody.  The actors, especially Katnip, are almost perfect duplicates to their characters in the real movies.  As a satire, it's not up there with Airplane or Police Squad, but it sure does have its moments.  There's an awful lot of potty humor in this unrated version, and I wish I had gotten the rated version instead",1456531200,,410,4.746478873239437
6087557,2,B00GMV89QI,It was a pretty cheap farce featuring all the mediocre movie castoffs in one venue.  Good for a chuckle over a case of beer and pizza with the boys from the Jersey shore.  Even the nudity was poorly done if you can imagine that.,1454371200,,228,4.159090909090909

6087562,3,B00GMV89QI,"After celebrating Dougs upcoming wedding, Bradley, Ed and Zach, wake up in a strange room in an even stranger world without their pal, Doug. When they meet the haughty Effing and the alcoholic Justmitch, our trio puts the pieces together and realizes that they are headed to The Hungover Games. But instead of the twelve districts of The Hunger Games, our guys have to go toe-to-toe against various Pop Culture Districts, including the Superhero District, the Gratuitous Nudity District, and the Johnny Depp District. Jamie Kennedy, Tara Reid, Jonathan Silverman, Robert Wagner, Bruce Jenner and many more join the all-star cast in an epic that makes a mockery of Hollywood. This is the story and it is the usual silliness that you come to expect from these kinds of movies. This is a very simple review...if you like this kind of movie, go for it. If you aren't into silly movies? Pass it by. it had some good laughs, a little too few and far between but I didn't hate it.",1449878400,,973,4.695906432748538

Yes, there's boobs and penis jokes to go along with it and if you are a prude, passing this by is probably a good move.  HOWEVER, If you have a word sense of humor, this is funny.

This will win no awards for anything.  It'll turn out to be a guilty pleasure or, if the stars align properly, a cult classic.  I'm thinking more if the former than latter.  Grab a bag of chips, pretzels or whatever, loosen up the bod', get your Al Bundy on and prepare to laugh.",1440633600,,1223,8.014814814814814

If you have a cracked, warped, degenerate sense of humor and have seen both 'The Hangover' and 'The Hunger Games' - you are going to laugh nearly straight through this. The casting director needs to be applauded for getting actors that not only look the part - but flat out nail body language, mannerisms and even speech patterns of the actors whom they are spoofing. The guys that spoof Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms will floor you.

This one seemed a little different from the others because there seemed to be a bit of a bite to it and it seemed like the writers didn't  like the movies they were parodying.  I think The Hunger Games is for stupids and The Hangover has zero appeal to me.  I cannot for the life of me  understand the appeal of Zack Galifianakis.  The impersonations were really, really good.  I especially liked the Johnny Depp mockery.  And the Gratuitous Nudity girl who kept getting her breasticles tangled in netting was really funny.  My one complaint is how they used that stupid expression, 'two in the pink, one in the stink.'  It's a stupid saying and it's dead wrong, it should be one in the pink, two in the sink.  You want the pink tight and the stink loose.  Everyone knows that...  It should go without saying that this movie is not for kids.

6088285,4,B00GMV89QI,"This is a spoof movie that is actually a pretty good one!  This film parodies The Hangover, Ted, Hunger Games, Django, The Muppets, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the Housewives TV shows, Avatar, Thor, the Walking Dead, and Carrie.  Also for some reason there were two topless women with large breasts in the movie who didn't do anything other than just have large breasts and show them off.  But then again I guess it's to draw guys in because Hollywood thinks that's all men want to watch.

Moving on, it's not a bad movie.  It takes the movies you loved a few years back and puts them all into the Hunger Games and lets them kill one another off.  I do have to admit that I liked seeing the women from the Housewives shows burn to death.  Those women on those shows are so bitchy and petty that you can't help but hate them.

The actors they got to be in this one were actually pretty good and they made the movie interesting.  All in all if you like spoof movies, this one is pretty good.  Check it out!",1426982400,,1015,4.294736842105263

6088584,4,B00GMV89QI,"I didn't have very high expectations for this one going in but it surprised me by how entertaining it was. The parody movie genre probably peaked in the late 80's and 90's with Naked Gun, UHF, and Hot Shots, with most parodies since then falling on the miss side of the hit and miss scale. But Hungover Games was actually quite good, in fact it's actually better than all the actual Hangover sequels. Obviously it's better than the sheer boredom of the Hunger Games first sequel. This merger of the two franchises has different actors of course, but the guy who plays Zach does a pretty close job to the original character, as does the guy with glasses.  The girl playing the main Hunger Games heroine does a good job too, although she doesn't have that many lines and is more of an inappropriate age object of lust for the guy with glasses, than anything else.  The massive plot holes in the original Hunger Games story are acknowledged by the behind the games characters and commentators.

Of course there's a fair bit of violence in this one, there's also a lot of breasts and crude humour, so it's not going to be for everyone's tastes.  Johnny Depp's various movie characters, Carrie, Ted, Django Unchained, Thor and a fair few other characters from recent movies are also fighting for their survival at the games.

Sure it's not the greatest movie ever made but you're watching this sort of movie to just sit back and be entertained and not have to think about what's going on in any great depth.  The Hungover Games certainly achieves that goal.",1425859200,,1552,4.625454545454545

There is a lot of potty humor and gratuitous sexuality/nudity, as is to be expected with this sort of thing.  It's like a raunchier version of the Wayans Brothers era Scary Movie films, but less limited by genre.  The cast is great, giving awesome comedic performances all around, and the effects are impressive for this sort of movie roasting menagerie.

6091971,5,B00GMV89QI,"By my own admission, I've only seen the second Hunger Games (Catching Fire). I saw the movie, along with my son, when it released in November 2013. But I came away with some very definite opinions about the movie as well as the whole Hunger Games, and similar (such as the (ugh!) Divergent), franchises. To be truly succinct and stay on point, these kinds of movies are simply horrible.... and just to nip this thought in the bud, I'm not going to read the books -- that's my perogative (as well as a great time saver!). As far as the movie itself - plodding, preachy, predictable, almost no depth, but (surprise!!! surprise!!!) occasionally good acting -- an unappealing combination. There's nothing that would make me want to watch future (or past) movies of this (or any other young adult fiction) franchise.

Spoofing Hunger Games by making a mash-up with the first Hangover was simply a great idea. At times a bit raunchy, the movie definitely brings out the laughs! Five stars for ""The Hungover Games"".",1407715200,8,1008,4.76

The way they stole pieces of other movies and spliced them together without any creativity or funny situations.  So many jokes.  None funny.  So many silly characters.  None funny.  So much slapstick.  None of it funny.

Why write a comedy, if you have no talent for it?  Even REAL comedians try their hands at funny movies and fail.  Why would a bunch of untalented, unfunny, corny writers and actors be allowed to create garbage like this?

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  This is the movie lame, unfunny people think is cool and edgy.

6092005,2,B00GMV89QI,"Generally speaking, I love parodies of popular films (yeah especially if I actually watched the original).  How would I ever forget ""Scary Movie"" or Scary Movie 2, or Spaceballs, or Robot Chicken's versions of Star Wars for example?
Prior to seeing Hungover Games, I'd already watched ""The Starving Games"" which I thought was pretty good (and Breaking Wind, a parody of the Twilight films).  Several things make a great parody.  One is how closely the actors and actresses resemble those in the original movie.  Here, Hungover Games gets a B-.  There's a pretty good look-alike for Ed Helms, but the girl doing Katniss does not look that close to Jennifer Lawrence.  As far as other characters, it isn't so hard to look like Elizabeth Banks' Effie, or Depp's Wonka, with all the makeup and props.  Some of the others were dreadful (like Harrelson's double).
Second: it helps to have clever dialog.  Here, I give this a C-.
Third: it's particularly cool when a parody manages a script that mashes up scenes from numerous other films and makes it all hang together like one story.  Again, this is somewhere below a C.  Good acting, directing and photography of course also help, and here the acting is erratic; some pretty good and some abysmal.

Overall I thought Starving Games was more fun than Hungover Games.  Though if you are over 21 with the mind of an adolescent, you may find some of the nudity and some of the visual jokes worth it, but this is simply no classic parody.",1398816000,,1479,4.712062256809339

I think the actors did a good job, and were pretty close to the original actors from the movies they were spoofing, And while not laugh out loud funny, it was funny enough to be a good comedy, and yet held my interest in other categories for me to recommend this movie if you are looking for a good quality spoof.
