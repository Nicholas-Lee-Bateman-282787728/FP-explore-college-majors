After being an ex-Marine & a New Orleans detective, John Cena returns to another WWE film with ""Legendary."" The movie revolves about a book-smart teenager named Calvin Chetley a.k.a. ""Cal"" (Devon Graye) who goes to high school in Oklahoma, lives with his mom Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), has a female best friend name Lulu (Madeleine Martin) who clearly has more than just ""friendship"" feelings for him which he's obivious to, and developed a friendship with an older man (Danny Glover) who looks out for him with good advice. He goes out for the wrestling team knowing the history with his brother & late-father having success in the sport, despite the fact that his mother is against it, but just has no luck at it. On the other side is Cal's brother Mike (Cena) who is a former All-American but very distant from his family, hard on his luck, and somehow keeps getting into trouble. Cal asked Mike to help train him initially & refused until Cal helped him out in court causing Mike to return the favor & train Cal leading to the brothers bonding together & Cal having better success wrestling. However they both still have to deal with issues throughout the movie like facing the issue that caused Mike to be so distant from not just Cal but his mother, Lulu & Cal's relationship evolving into something more, and Mike's past catching up to him.

The Reunion:
Nina Cleary's (Amy Smart) father recently died with his last wish being to bring his three sons of suspended cop Sam (John Cena) & bail bondsman Leo (Ethan Embry) & ex-con Douglas (Boyd Holbrook) together so as a condition of his will, they will each collect an inheritance of $3 million if they were to run a family business together for two years. There is clear tension between Sam & Rico as they haven't seen each other in a decade while the youngest one in Douglas had never met any of his siblings previously. Meanwhile, a couple of hitmen take a corporation owner in Kyle Wills (Gregg Henry) hostage into Mexico with one of the kidnappers being identified as Leo's bailjumper named Edgar (Rio Alexander) who left him in debt, the brothers are convinced to go find him & get the reward money. In Mexico, they run into various issues such as getting information from Edgar's famous girlfriend who just happens to have an eye for Douglas, a drug lord named Verdugo (J.D. Garfield) who tells them to leave town or be killed, the kidnappers trying to kill them, meeting up with a woman named Theresa Trujillo (Lela Loren) who ends up having a common enemy with the boys, and the brothers trying to tolerate each other throughout the entire venture.

""Legendary"" unlike any previous WWE film in that this wasn't an action based movie as it was more focused on being a more serious family drama as Cena played more of a supporting role in his best acting effort as he showed diversity playing a guy who clearly had some emotional issues with a bad attitude in the first half of the film with the acting with everyone else was very good & the best cast put together for a WWE film to date along with the multiple stories being told throughout the film.  ""The Reunion"" was one of the most enjoyable WWE films as far as action based as the attempts at comedy/action were good & not overdone as Cena did more acting than previous two action based movies while everyone else played their parts well.  In the end, I enjoyed both movies I would recommend this collection.",1399939200,2,3438,4.640394088669951
