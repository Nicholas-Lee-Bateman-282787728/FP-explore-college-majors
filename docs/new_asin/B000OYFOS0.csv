8395701,5,B000OYFOS0,"I do not understand why this DVD has received so many negative reviews.
This DVD is a concert DVD,concerts are generally dark, so that is why the picture quality is dark.
The bonus features which include: a photo gallary, an interview with the classic members, The Ballad of Jayne and Never Enough live are all great DVD extras.
I hope that people decide to purchase this DVD despite it's negative reviews, because this is a five star DVD.",1241395200,3,439,4.641025641025641
8395702,1,B000OYFOS0,"The bottom line is any product to come from Cleopatra Records (as this piece of crap clearly is) have always been of poor quality not to mention the people that run the company must be complete morons, as you will notice many spelling errors on their products... Even band names have spelling errors on some of their items I have come across over the years LOL!!! It's a disgrace not to mention an insult to the bands that have agreed to have some of their material released on this joke of a label... this compny needs to shut down! as it is clearly run by a bunch of burn-outs LOL!!! Seriously, it is THE laughing stock of the music industry.",1234915200,2,644,4.375
8395703,1,B000OYFOS0,"I can not believe that a DVD with the awfull quality as this can be on the market!!! please do not buy it....i bought it ...the reviews most of the time are important to me but in this case i forgot to read them, and bought this piece of garbage..! and I love L.A Guns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What a shame!!one star just because is L.A GUNS....!",1222732800,2,335,4.333333333333333
8395704,1,B000OYFOS0,"I agree with the other reviewers,this video is bad!! Only for the most diehard Guns fans. I am a diehard Guns fan myself but don't care for this release. The ONLY point of my review is to once again demand the DVD reissue/release of L.A. Guns ""Love,Peace & Geese"" & ""One More Reason"" videos. ARE YOU LISTENING RHINO?? SOMEONE,ANYONE???",1198972800,10,335,4.694915254237288
8395705,1,B000OYFOS0,"IM A DIE HARD FAN OF THE VAMPIRES, AND THATS THE REASON I PURCHASED THE DVD, BUT THE QUALITY IS SO POOR. WHAT A SHAME. THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THE PHOTO GALLERY : A SLIDE SHOW WITH THE BALLAD OF JAYNE. ALSO INCLUDES 2 PERFORMANCES AS BONUS: JAYNE AND NEVER ENOUGH, AND A BRIEF DOCUMENTARY WITH INTERVIEWS ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THE BAND WITH THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS( INTERESTING BUT SHORT )

THE CONCERT IS RAW, BUT THE PROBLEM IS U CANT SEE WELL THE BAND AND THE SOUND IS ....IS....TERRIBLE !

THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT RETURN THE DVD IS: IM A DIE HARD FAN ( CRAZY UH?)

ONE STAR FOR THE DVD COVER AND FOR RESPECT TO THE BAND

STILL ROCK ON!!",1189987200,12,637,4.112903225806452
8395706,1,B000OYFOS0,"this product is a pure money grab. la. guns or whoever put this out (label?)should be ashamed of yourselves.picture is so dark you can hardly see the band except phil lewis.sound is barely audible. i have a thousand watt surround system and had to turn it all the way up, and it still stunk.  i just returned for a refund.stay far away metal fans. and i really like la.guns.",1181088000,21,374,4.420289855072464
