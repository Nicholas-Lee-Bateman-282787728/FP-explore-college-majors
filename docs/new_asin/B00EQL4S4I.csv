5934769,5,B00EQL4S4I,"biased.

I <3 her.

My entire familia loves her. Except mi madre. Ummm.... I wished it was longer though. *sigh*",1382572800,,112,4.55
5934770,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara is an artist that really needs to tour in the UK (where I live). Her live performances are amazing, and this one in particular shows how she has improved leaps and bounds over the years (her earlier ""Live at the Fillmore"" DVD is also excellent, but this one is much more accomplished with a wider range of songs available for her to choose from). The songs are a mix of our favourites, with additional songs from her EP ""Once Upon Another Time"" adding a more laid-back tone in the middle. Highlights for me? Brave (possibly the happiest/best single for years from anyone) and ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", the best cover of that song ever done.

Buy this - you won't regret it.",1382400000,,681,4.536585365853658
5934771,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara is one of the most ""human"" singers. She has this flawless voice and she is a real person. She cusses and jokes with the audience and you feel like you are watching a friend onstage. Every song she performs is perfect and she has one of those voices that you can tell is effortless for her. She is a very true and real artist and you should buy this DVD/CD so you can meet this awesome artist!",1382400000,,397,4.102564102564102
5934772,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara is the rare performer who somehow manages to sound even better live than she does on CD. It's almost as if she holds back a little bit in the recording studio, but onstage she really lets loose. This CD and DVD are proof of how strong and pure her voice really is. There's no fancy mixing or post-production here; I saw this tour the night after it was filmed, and she really does sound this remarkable live.

The ""Brave Enough"" tour was Sara alone onstage with a handful of instruments, telling stories, cutting up with the audience, and playing a mix of new songs, reworked classics and covers. Speaking of the covers, Sara has a knack for taking a beloved song and making it her own. ""Hollywood Reporter"" even said that her cover of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" is ""so spine-tingling that -- blasphemous as this might seem -- it might eclipse any rendering of it that Elton himself has ever done."" Another highlight of the show is ""I Just Want You,"" a tender, ukulele-backed tune that Sara performed only on this tour. In closing, kudos to Sara & Co. for leaving the DVD largely unedited, complete with audience banter and even flubbed lyrics during one song. It lets you see how personable, raw and engaging she is, particularly in a setting as intimate as Variety Playhouse.

EDIT 10/24/13: For the record, there are no special features on the DVD.",1382400000,26,1357,4.626556016597511
5934773,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara Bareilles bravely puts would-be diary entries to music that's sometimes rocking, hopping, and popping, and other times soothing, mellowing, and melodious.  She inspires, emboldens, and entertains us, and it breaks my heart to see her less recognized than she should be on charts and in awards--but at least we fans know how lucky we are to behold the sacred creations of this incredibly powerful woman.  I thanked her very loudly at the Greek Theater in L.A. on 9/11/13, and she briefly engaged me in conversation, but I forgot to thank her specifically for sending out her ""Satellite Call"".  Thank you SO much, forever and ever, Sara.  Love always!",1382313600,6,654,4.972477064220183
5934774,5,B00EQL4S4I,I really enjoy all of Sara's music.  I've recently picked up on her and really enjoy all of her albums I've listened too.  This is one of my favorites.,1464480000,,151,4.172413793103448

5934777,5,B00EQL4S4I,Great!,1456272000,,6,6.0
5934778,5,B00EQL4S4I,Sara Bareilles is definitely one of my favorite singer songwriters of all time.  Her live performances are every bit as good or even better than her studio recordings.  This video filmed at one of her solo concerts (sans backup band) is no exception.  The musical performances were heartfelt and the dialog in between songs gives a good glimpse of her sarcastic and wonderfully irreverent personality.,1450569600,2,401,5.138461538461539
5934779,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sarah rocks!
A couple unecessary F bombs here and there, but great music and a you get an idea how great of an act she has.
Very talented musician!",1449705600,,147,4.103448275862069
5934780,1,B00EQL4S4I,"Immature.  I heard one of Sara's songs on Pandora, and wasted my money on this CD...",1444780800,,84,4.25
5934781,5,B00EQL4S4I,"My girlfriend enjoyed the CD, and was pleasantly surprised with the DVD concert",1440288000,,79,5.153846153846154
5934782,5,B00EQL4S4I,"This album is a stroke of genius of Sara Bareilles - who is performer, song writer (of most songs on the album) and producer of this fine musical effort.  You can fault the non-slick DVD video production, but not Sara for her performance.  The heavily produced confines of today's popular music drains the life from music (a la MP3). The live minimally produced performance (no overdub) allows the fresh live essence of the music to present itself.  It this case truly less is (incredibly) better!  All is all the magnificent artistry of Sara Bareilles shines.  I enjoyed this album and gave a few copies away to friends.  At 5' 5"" tall her talent is taller than most redwoods in my book!  We hope she comes back to the west coast to perform again soon!  I hope to see future live efforts by Sara Bareilles.",1439683200,,807,4.555555555555555
5934783,5,B00EQL4S4I,"I bought this as a surprise for my sister because she had commented on the concert video several times. She is thrilled. Almost every time I get in the car she has the CD playing. Don't know how much use she is getting from the DVD, but I know she was very happy with the surprise.",1435795200,,281,4.035714285714286
5934784,5,B00EQL4S4I,Heard this at a Hi Fi Show and had to have it. Great CD and a vid to boot. Fast shipping.,1435536000,,89,3.2857142857142856
5934785,4,B00EQL4S4I,Very talented lady. Skillful and perfect execution of some very special songs. Let down by unnesessary swearing!,1434412800,,112,5.647058823529412

5934787,5,B00EQL4S4I,I always like Sara Bareilles' live material. Her colorful in between songs conversation are just as good as the songs themselves.,1428969600,,129,5.190476190476191

5934795,5,B00EQL4S4I,"I still can't believe I was front row at this concert.  It was the best night ever!  I am so thankful that she let me come up to her during the show and give her that Braves jersey with her name on it, and she decided to show it on the DVD!  Sara is not only an amazing singer but she has class!  She even gave everyone who waited for her out back an autograph and picture with her!",1416787200,,382,3.7974683544303796
5934796,5,B00EQL4S4I,"OMG, she's a great songwriter, not to mention being adorable.  Love it.",1416528000,,71,4.916666666666667

5934804,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Great DVD/CD combination of a fantastic concert!  The quality of the DVD is very nice and the CD is wonderful.  Sara Bareilles is one of my all time favorite singer/songwriters so I am a little biased, but this is a really great combo!",1408579200,,235,4.441860465116279
5934805,5,B00EQL4S4I,"This live-concert set includes both a CD and DVD of one of Sara's concerts. They are both good, but she is a real joy to watch in concert, so I prefer the DVD. Her big hits -- Love Song and Brave -- are here, but so are her renditions of Elton John's Bennie and the Jets and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which she nails in her own style. She also performs Otis Redding's Sitting on the Dock of the Bay and Neil Diamond's Love on the Rocks, plus more tunes of her own. She's a great performer with a powerhouse voice, and this two-disc set delivers.",1407628800,,546,4.160377358490566
5934806,5,B00EQL4S4I,excellent. felt like I was there.,1404864000,,33,4.666666666666667
5934807,5,B00EQL4S4I,My daughter-in-law asked for this for Christmas and was delighted with it.,1404000000,,74,5.25
5934808,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Singer Songwriters are rare now days. Her songs are fresh, inventive and her voice/delivery can breathe live into any song",1403222400,,122,5.15
5934809,5,B00EQL4S4I,"This is the first DVD/CD I've purchased in a long time, and I'm glad I did. She is an amazing artist...way underrated. I prefer to listen to female vocals in general, especially in this type of scenario. I wish she would sing more blues. The only issue I have is that if you have young children, I wouldn't let them listen to it because she uses some profanity.",1401753600,,361,4.323529411764706
5934810,5,B00EQL4S4I,Sara is very enjoyable to see live and see how she engages the audience in her song stories that touch many lives.  Bravo!,1401321600,,122,4.304347826086956
5934811,5,B00EQL4S4I,"I ordered two of these, one for myself and one for my cousin. Great timing on shipping/delivery, the DVD and cd I opened and kept for myself work great! The little prongs that hold the discs in place were broken in the case but that's not really a big deal to me. Love it!! Happy with my purchase!",1398643200,,297,4.137931034482759
5934812,3,B00EQL4S4I,The show was great. The sound recording is great. The video editing is absolute garbage. The editor went crazy cutting back and forth between black and white clips to over saturated color shots.  At one point he added a shot of him filming the tv screen.  The color correction is a travesty.  The only other bigger travesty is that Sara Bareilles paid this person to destroy her video.,1394928000,3,385,4.632352941176471
5934813,5,B00EQL4S4I,"This DVD is brilliant. It's just Sara and her voice and instruments, mostly piano but there are some amazingly good guitar songs in the middle. It's stripped and raw and Sara at her finest.",1393632000,,189,4.588235294117647
5934814,5,B00EQL4S4I,If you've ever been to a Sara Bareilles concert you know you going to experience music that sounds even better than the album.  And Sara injects her humor with comments and short and witty quips about her life. Incredibly fun and entertaining. Guarantee you'll love this!,1393372800,,271,4.891304347826087
5934815,5,B00EQL4S4I,"I caught part of the show on PBS but had never seen her live. I was familiar with her song Brave but that was about it. I love a natural born talent! No fireworks, no dancers, no electronically modified singing, just a woman and her instruments. Very talented woman.....",1392940800,,270,4.530612244897959
5934816,5,B00EQL4S4I,It looks like a good time was had by all that night.  I enjoyed her banter before the songs and how she engaged the audience.,1392768000,,125,4.0
5934817,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Even if you could not make it to one of her concerts - this DVD makes it feel like you're there.  She's so personable and likable.  Plus, quite a talent...which is proven in her live show.",1392595200,,188,4.194444444444445
5934818,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara Bareilles is such a huge talent.  Love all of her songs, but especially her rendition of ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road"".  Totally cool and amazing!!!",1392422400,,154,4.884615384615385
5934819,5,B00EQL4S4I,"BRAVE ENOUGH, FUNKY ENOUGH, COOL ENOUGH, SWEET ENOUGH, CHARISMATIC ENOUGH, DEEP ENOUGH!!! LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR BRILLIANT ARTISTS LIKE SARA BAREILLES THAT PERFORM LIVE WHAT THEY LAY DOWN ON THE ALBUM PLUS MORE.",1392422400,,209,5.176470588235294
5934820,5,B00EQL4S4I,"This DVD is the best Live Album/DVD I've ever seen. I have Adele's, Paramore's, Tegan and Sara's, P!nk's, and Beyonc&eacute;'s DVD's. These come close but Sara has this amazing voice that I am having trouble describing right now. I personally think that these live songs are better than the studio versions. Love on the Rocks, Sittin' on the Dock, I Just Want You, Come Round Soon, Uncharted are so amazing parts in this concert, and her interaction is hilarious.",1392336000,,463,4.8734177215189876
5934821,4,B00EQL4S4I,"I really like Sara Bareilles. I have seen her in concert and really like her informal, down to earth, natural style. This seems to be changing some, as all artists do. This is a more polished and seemingly processed performance than I experienced with other in-person concerts that I attended. I also have the album Brave Enough', actually, I have all her albums. It also is a more formal, or more calculating type of music, to me at least. I seem to hear drum machines ( always a negative), and the lyrics are evolving into more sophisticated and complex types of songs. It just isn't the girl from Eureka, California that just got ""discovered"" anymore. I like it, but not in the same way.",1392163200,,690,4.57258064516129
5934822,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Once I saw this, I had to have it.  She has an amazing style!  Would recommend to all. . .",1391990400,,90,3.45
5934823,5,B00EQL4S4I,Sara Bareilles is amazing and this CD/DVD set is great! Her performances are heartfelt and warm. I recommend this to any fan.,1391990400,,125,4.7272727272727275
5934824,5,B00EQL4S4I,This is everything you would expect and want from a live DVD. She sounds great live. I absolutely Love it!,1391817600,,106,4.35
5934825,1,B00EQL4S4I,"Considered most songs all knockoffs of other singers.  Not much original material.  Could have done without her commentary between ""songs"".",1391731200,,139,5.9
5934826,5,B00EQL4S4I,"If you are the slightest bit of a Sara Bareilles fan, you need this...NOW!  I have never enjoyed a live concert DVD so much!  Sara B is changing music!",1391558400,,151,4.172413793103448
5934827,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Such a gifted performer and musician. Would recommend this to anyone. Buy it if you are even remotely considering it, you won't regret it.",1390435200,,138,4.791666666666667
5934828,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Can't get enough of Sara since I first heard her voice.  It's beautiful, relaxing and very pleasant experience regardless of what I'm doing.  Have bought several of her albums since.  Well worth it, in my opinion.",1390348800,,213,4.861111111111111
5934829,5,B00EQL4S4I,Simply true hearted and ispired. She also have a way to interact with the crowd that makes her work like no one other.,1390348800,,118,4.173913043478261
5934830,3,B00EQL4S4I,"I don't understand why someone would try to create a new DVD case format, but it was an awful idea. I've just returned it because the case came broken and it won't fit where I place my DVD's and Blu-Ray's.",1390262400,,205,4.15
5934831,5,B00EQL4S4I,Just a great performance with her in a small club. Her voice is so powerful. This is a must see for everyone who likes a great singer/songwriter!!!!!!!!!!,1390089600,,154,4.7407407407407405
5934832,3,B00EQL4S4I,One of the 2 CD's doesn't work at all.  I paid $20 for this item and can only listen to 1 of the CD's.  I do like the CD I can listen to.,1389571200,,137,3.121212121212121
5934833,5,B00EQL4S4I,"She is amazing!!!! By far my all time favorite artist bc of her creativity, fearlessness and originality. Beautiful voice and extremely funny!",1389398400,,142,5.5
5934834,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Often concerts with lots of cameras end up feeling disconnected from the performer because of the compulsion to constantly switch camera angles, but this one feels warm and intimate, despite a lot of cameras. The audio and performance are great, as is the patter. One of the best filmed concerts I've seen.",1389398400,,306,4.903846153846154
5934835,5,B00EQL4S4I,"When I saw this concert one night on Palladia, I almost fell out of my chair. I saw her doing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. WOW. Amazing arrangement, and what range!",1389398400,,162,4.433333333333334
5934836,5,B00EQL4S4I,"She is quirky, fun, and has a powerhouse voice. I loved watching this, and if you haven't been to a concert of hers, this will give you a glimpse as to what it is like.  :)",1389312000,,172,3.7777777777777777
5934837,4,B00EQL4S4I,"Bareilles gives a riveting solo performance. The evening starts a little slow but builds in power as it continues, ending in a breathtaking performance of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the videography is only fair, don't let that get in your way. If you like Sara, you will love this DVD.",1389225600,3,324,4.508474576271187
5934838,4,B00EQL4S4I,"I'd give this fun, engaging, live performance 5 stars, but the sound is not so good.  Sara has a tremendous voice, it should not be hampered by tech limitations.  I'll be looking for her studio CDs now.",1388620800,2,202,4.4324324324324325

5934842,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Great double pack (cd and DVD) of fabulous artist, mix of covers and originals. Was very happy, Sara Bareilles is fantastic!",1388102400,,124,4.9523809523809526
5934843,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara is hands down the best young singer/song writer out there today. The concert is bare bones - just her accompanying herself on the piano and other instruments. Yet, the editing and many camera angles as well as Sara's connection with the audience (and viewer) make this concert very entertaining. The songs are a wonderful selection of some of her best work to date. The vocals are perfection. I highly recommend this DVD for any Sara Bareilles fan - or anyone interested in discovering a talent that will be around for decades.",1387843200,,532,4.793478260869565
5934844,5,B00EQL4S4I,"As with all Sara Bareilles music, this was absolutely amazing. I am so happy that I purchased this and that, along with the DVD, they give you a CD to put the music on your computer/phone. She included the song ""I just want you"" which she has never recorded before and is really beautiful. If you've been to any of her concerts you know that she is hilarious and interacts with the audience well and this really shines through in the DVD.",1387756800,,438,4.353658536585366
5934845,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara Bareilles is a tremendous talent and wonderful performer. Witty, funny, charming, heartfelt, and, yes, brave. ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" and ""I Just Want You"" are stunners. So glad I took the fangirl plunge and bought this.",1387584000,,229,5.216216216216216
5934846,5,B00EQL4S4I,"She is amazing, as someone else mentioned another review,  she is a even better live, if you are fan of Sara Bareilles,I highly recommend this CD /DVD.",1387324800,,151,4.592592592592593
5934847,5,B00EQL4S4I,I rate this recording 5 stars because I like the energy and enthusiasm that Sara generates on stage in front of a live audience.  I also like the fact that Sara is able to generate and encourage audience participation in her shows.,1387065600,,231,4.5
5934848,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Sara's latest tour has easily been my favorite concert experience.  Not only did I get an autograph and photo with her, but the concert itself was amazing.  She is one hell of a performer, swearing and joking between every song.  You feel like you've known her your whole life.  Her singing is at its best, and she covers some amazing songs between her own.",1386979200,2,357,4.53125

I love her voice and lyrics and also the way she interacts with her audience.  This concert was filmed really well with really nice camera views and great audio. My wife and I have seen her twice in Boston and will go to see her again the next time she comes around!",1386374400,,432,4.375
5934854,4,B00EQL4S4I,"A pretty good concert with the music cd included. This was a nice, intimate concert to watch. Having the cd to listen is  nice bonus.",1386288000,,133,4.32
5934855,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Brave Enough? Yes, she is! I watched the DVD as soon as it arrived today. Without having read the other comments, I commented to my Hubby (who watched it with me) about the power of her voice and that she really holds back on albums. This incredible format was well done, and I would definitely love to see her perform live. Sara Bareilles' Bravery and vulnerability is an encouragement to behold, and something towards which to aspire.

That Sara Bareilles writes her own lyrics was part of what got me interested in her music. And of course, the music itself. She takes an ""upbeat"" tune, but when you pay attention to the lyrics, you can see the darkness and feel the ache sympathetically. Then there's the easy ""laid back"" tunes that have bright and happy lyrics. This Brave Enough DVD allowed me to see more of Ms. Bareilles' talent, with her playing the piano, acoustic guitar, ukulele, ""hand organ,"" and an electric guitar all by herself on stage while talking w/ the audience and singing away. She give a wonderful, down-to-earth performance.

I love that the editors of the DVD left in the interaction with the audience. The questions from folks in the audience and Ms. Bareilles' witty comebacks are so enjoyable and they actually made me laugh. Hearing the artist ""mess up"" her own lyrics, be up front about it, being REAL about music is a reminder of the true artist that is within Sara Bareilles. There's rawness, realness, and just an all around organic enjoyable experience to listening to Sara Bareilles, whether it be CD or this recorded live performance.

Summary: If you want to see an *artist* perform the way they used to (without the techno enhancements/corrections/lip syncing) and you want to hear some real music with heartfelt lyrics, then give this DVD a try! Be forewarned-- there's swearing! If you have little ones or do not like to hear cussing, then you might want to by-pass this gem, however, if colorful language (not out of proportion) isn't a problem for you, then you might find yourself snickering or laughing, like I did. If (by some far-fetched chance) you don't like it, don't worry, there's plenty of mimicries of pre-packaged, mass feedings on the radio for you.

Bring on the talent. Bring on the vulnerability. Bring on the Brave!",1386028800,10,2275,4.795918367346939
5934856,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Amazing CD! The live version of Brave is even better than the radio edit. Once again, she brings down the house with one of the best songs ever written and performed....Gravity!

5934857,5,B00EQL4S4I,"Saw this show live at The Wiltern in LA and it was, without doubt, the best show I have ever seen. A master class in performance and singing. So when I learned that Sara was releasing a DVD I ordered it.
My recommendation? BUY IT! Brilliantly executed. The rapt attention of the audience says it all. I will also bet that Sara's interpretation of Elton John's ""Yellow Brick Road"" will astound you!",1385942400,,397,4.527777777777778

5934860,5,B00EQL4S4I,"This pretty much says it all ... in Sara's own words.
I have been to two of her concerts, and wish I would have made it to one of them on this particular tour ... such an intimate and genuine experience.

""At the strong urging of some close friends (thank you guys) I made myself go on a solo tour and face what had up until that point been a pretty large fear of mine. It ended being one of my favorite experiences of my whole life. I was shocked and grateful and so proud of that accomplishment. With 8 shows left in the tour, another good friend of mine who had just seen the show said, ""hey dummy, record this. It's special."" (Exact quote... My memory is impeccable.)

And so I let him record it himself. :) Thanks and love to Bryan Mir for the push to record this and get it out to my fans. We left in just about every moment of the show...it's hardly edited for content at all, so my fans (and selfishly I) would have a raw and honest token of this truly unique time in my life. If you didn't already know, I'm long winded and crass, and I swear a lot. And I'm not sorry.

I'm blessed to have good friends who push me to be better than I am. I did all of this because of them and I can't find the words to express my gratitude.
You only live once, and right now I'm feeling lucky that I get to live alongside them, and all of you. What a ride.
Hope you enjoy. """,1385164800,,1367,3.9817518248175183

Sara's personality is on full display.  Too bad she feels the need to channel Sara Silverman on occasion.

Concert in Phx was way too short on time and was rushed.  This concert is what I expected and dovetails perfectly to her other live dvd.  Get both.",1385078400,,388,4.746268656716418

5934868,5,B00EQL4S4I,"I always have trouble formulating a fitting description of the musical genius that is Sara Bareilles.  First of all, she has a sense of humor that just reels you in. Then, her musical talent, is off the charts, her voice is perfection and her song lyrics are powerful.  I ""discovered"" Sara back in 2007, when a song came on the radio (Love Song) that I had never heard before.....I found myself tapping my toes and singing along with the song, even though I didn't know the lyrics  LOL.  I drove directly to the store and bought ""Little Voice"". It only took one time listening to the entire album, for me to be hooked.  My love for Sara has only grown since......and I have been lucky enough to have seen her live 6 times in the past 3 years.  I saw her perform on her ""Brave Enough"" solo tour back in April  of 2013 at the Tsai Ctr at Boston University. It was probably one of the best performances I have ever seen in person...ever.  This DVD/CD combo is from another stop on that tour....but the power, energy and emotion of Sara Bareilles shines thru as always. Sara's cover of Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" is worth the price of this DVD/CD by itself.  There is no better performer in the world today and I feel lucky to have seen her as often as I have. Buy this DVD, you have my word, you will not regret it. A masterpiece.",1383177600,,1341,4.332

I have seen her 3 times and was unable to see her on the Brave Enough tour since she didn't come to a city near me. The footage is so raw and so her that I actually felt like I was at her concert.
There was a song that she sang the last time I saw her called 'I Just Want You'. I thought it was the most beautiful song ever! She has never recorded it and I was beyond thrilled to find out that it's on the cd!!
You will not regret this purchase! I've been listening to the cd on repeat all day and plan on continuing to do so!

5934872,5,B00EQL4S4I,"You might say that Sara Bareilles had me at ""Love Song"" her catchy and first No. 1 hit. But my admiration for her work grew with each release, from ""Little Voice"" to ""Kaleidoscope Heart"" to her latest release ""The Blessed Unrest"". She reeled me in for the kill with her latest single ""Brave"", a song she says she wrote in part to support a friend of hers who recently came out as a lesbian. As a gay man, I found her especially brave to stand up for the gay community.

""Love Song"" and ""Brave"" are both included here, as glorious stripped down versions, packed full of energy and love for the Atlanta audience who has come to see her. The bond between singer and audience at the Variety  Playhouse is palpable. The audience even gets a lovely song Bareilles has written just for them and never recorded on any other record, the heartfelt  ""I Just Want You"".

Bareilles has a stage presence like no other, though you must watch the DVD to fully appreciate it, as the CD is edited and a lot of her funniest on stage banter is dropped. Beginning with ""Love On The Rocks"" with a nod to Elton John's Bennie and the Jets at the tail end, things get off to a powerful start, followed by a beautiful, unplugged version of ""Uncharted"" and the slow, piano driven ""Manhattan"", which sends chills up the spine. Bareilles  accompanies herself on acoustic and electric guitars, turning in stellar versions of ""Let the Rain"" and ""Come Round Soon"". This live recording, which showcases her electric guitar skills, is hands down the best version of ""Come Round Soon"" I have ever heard. Because she is in Atlanta, she delivers a soulful version of Otis Redding's ""Dock of the Bay"" with its lyric, ""left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco Bay."" The cheeky ""King of Anything"" is here as well, another of my favorites, which turns into a powerful anthemic singalong.
Another highlight is the mostly acapella ""Once Upon Another Time"", which Sara performs with an upright accordion-like instrument which she said she bought just for performing this particular song, from her EP of the same name.

The concert ends with a tour de force performance of Bareilles' beautifiully crafted song ""Gravity"" and a reverential, rousing rendition of the Elton John classic ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"". A triumph for both Sara Bareilles' diehard fans, of which I count myself, and a fine starting point for those who are not familiar with her work. Brave enough indeed.",1382745600,13,2439,4.713615023474178

The DVD includes all the banter between songs, and for this performance she was highly engaged with the audience. It's definitely closer to a ""concert experience"" than a typical DVD where you get a string of isolated individual song videos that zoom in on the performer(s).

It's funny how awkward/insecure and shy she comes across, even after a good deal of commercial success by the time of this performance and an audience that was clearly loving every note.",1501027200,,538,4.78494623655914
