8195875,5,B000QEJ12I,"I enjoyed this video tutorial on modeling the human head. It contained a variety of techniques I will use in all organic modeling projects. Although this is an older tutorial (you don't see to many Lightwave tutorials being made these days), it covers Lightwave 9 and has techniques that can be useful for just about any version.

Taron is an excellent instructor and I felt like the lessons were almost one on one.

My only complaint is small. This has to be viewed ON your computer. I prefer tutorial DVDs I can play on the TV in my studio.

Otherwise, great!",1346025600,,561,4.534653465346534
