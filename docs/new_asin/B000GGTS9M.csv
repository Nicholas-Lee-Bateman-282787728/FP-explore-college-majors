8132049,5,B000GGTS9M,"This group was helped put together by the same force behind the Silver Convention I think maybe that is why Fly Robin Fly is here and others that seem similar.

This band was formed in 1978 and was on tour soon after and all of their hits except for Ecstasy is featured. I became a fan a long time ago and found this set to be very fun and easy to relax to and listen to. No ""devil music"" here :)

Listening to Sandra and the other singers really takes me back to childhood, and this set has made me very happy. Recommend...
