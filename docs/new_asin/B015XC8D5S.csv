8735025,3,B015XC8D5S,"I caught this movie on TV out of curiosity. It's not as bad as some reviews, or the cover, might imply, but it's not terrible. The acting and cinematography is good, as is the music, but the story could have been a little better. At times it seemed a little rushed, and at others it seemed too drawn out.

Chloe's supposed schizophrenia could have been better explained. A little more attention should have been paid to it instead of it just being rushed through, although I liked that her performance was a little more realistic than most. Some actors who portray schizophrenic people tend to go overboard. Lauren also seemed a little too easily manipulated by Olivia. I would have liked to also see Olivia's character expanded a little, developed more. Lauren also came off a little one-dimensional, and I felt like the actor was trying too hard. Also, though I know this is a Lifetime movie, it was a little unsettling that the adult characters were a bit lax at times. *SPOILER* What worried mother allows someone, even if they're a friend, to just take their mentally ill daughter out for a drive, and then wonder why they're not home come nighttime?

This movie is no ""Exorcist"" or ""Last Exorcism"" but it is an entertaining film. It's a Lifetime movie. You honestly can't expect that much from it.",1472601600,2,1303,4.685589519650655
8735026,2,B015XC8D5S,"An artist creates a DVD cover to look like ""The Craft"" with a catchy title. Unfortunately they attached a made for TV film to it. The original Lifetime title was ""High School Possession."" Chloe (Jennifer Stone) unconvincing shows us she has issues and hears voices. She has the token hot Asian friend (Janel Parrish) in a Hollywood High School with only hot chicks. Is Chloe possessed or just menatlly ill? Will the town exorcist help? (Apparently demonic possession is an issue even in a California paradise.)

The acting wasn't there. The voices in Chloe's head is the most entertaining dialogue in the film. The ending has a twist, which doesn't create the needed climax.

Guide: No swearing or nudity. Poorly implied sex.  Great DVD cover.

Note to self: Do not use cuticle scissors for suicide.",1452297600,4,799,4.896296296296296
