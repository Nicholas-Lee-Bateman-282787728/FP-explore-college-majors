8146675,1,B000IOM2AE,I paid $4.50 + $2.95 shipping for this collection and i would say this collection is probably worth no more than $1.00 total with shipping. The volume is pathetic in some of the movies and the picture quality is like watching a VHS that was recorded in slow play. One of the movies is cut short. THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES OUT THERE!,1268352000,2,331,4.354838709677419

8146678,2,B000IOM2AE,"This review is for ""Spaghetti Westerns Gunfighters Collection"".

Movies in this set:
1) Death Rides a Horse
2) Boot Hill
3) The Gunfighters
4) One-Eyed Jacks

The other reviewer is spot on with their comment about the poor quality of the audio & video of these DVD's.  Based on that alone I would not recommend this item for purchase.

One Eyed Jacks is unwatchable - I could not here the audio above a whisper even with the volumn turned all the way up.

Boot Hill is unwatchable - It is of such poor quality, mostly dark, that it is very difficult to follow what is going on in the movie because you can't tell who is who.

Death Rides a Horse - is watchable but there are better quality DVD's of this movie that are available.

Gunfighters - is watchable.

As for entertainment value - I liked all 4 movies.  Some are average and some are better than average.  I'm sure your personal milage will vary from mine.

I would recommend Mean Guns 20 Movie Pack and Spaghetti Westerns 20 Movie Pack over this item.  The video of Death Rides a Horse and Boot Hill in these collections are far superior to that in this DVD collection.",1214956800,11,1128,4.396135265700483
