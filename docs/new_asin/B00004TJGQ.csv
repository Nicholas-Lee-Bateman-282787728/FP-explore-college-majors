1350758,5,B00004TJGQ,"Gundam Wing Vol. 3,Cold Battlefield, is a great purchase for any Gundam Wing fan.  The violence is limited to robots getting blown up.  For you adults, that means it's good for kids!  Great for anyone who likes manga  also.  It's great because it has a mix of action, suspense, and espionage.",960768000,2,292,4.647058823529412

7922716,4,B00004TJGQ,"Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,557,4.6938775510204085

Duo and Quatre go into hiding, and Trowa is pondering commiting suicide himself.  In what is definately the dark point of the series, the Gundam pilots are unable to do things they were able to before.  This DVD features 5 episodes, including: 11: The Whereabouts of Happiness Relena plans to get revenge on Lady Une, while Duo and Trowa go into hiding with the Magunac's help. 12: Bewildered Warriors Heero awakens from his coma, meanwhile Wufei still depressed over his loss, assists some rebels. 13: Catherine's Tears Zechs finds out that not all those in OZ are as honorable as him.

7922721,5,B00004TJGQ,"I think that this DVD is very good, and a whole lot better than the videos. It is also un-cut, and that makes it better. This DVD contains 5 episodes.  11:The Whereabouts of Happiness
12:Bewildered Soldiers  13:Catherine's Tears  14:The Order to Destroy 1  15:To the Battleground-Antartica
The First one concerns Quatre and Duo. They get there gundams repaired with all of Quatre's Friends. Also, Relena goes to Moscow to kill Lady Une for killing her father.
The Second Episode is mostly about Wufei. He meets Sally Po and helps her fight off the Alliance and Oz. He informs her that the weak shouldn't be fighting.
The Third Episode is about Trowa and Heero. Trowa decides he wants to put on a show in his circus with his gundam and attacks an Oz facility. He almost kills himself but Catherine's Tears stop him.
The Fourth Episode revolves around Heero. He decides to visit Marshal Noventa's Granddaughter, and he hands her a gun to shoot him. He apoligizes to her. Trowa also holds off Alliance Troops.
The Fifth and final episode has Lietendent Noin visit Trowa and Heero and ask them to go to Antarctica to fight Zechs. They go but are followed by suspicious Oz Carriers...  This is a very good DVD, and the sound quality is great. I highly suggest it, especially if you like Gundam Wing.",970704000,8,1294,4.682819383259912
7922722,5,B00004TJGQ,"Some people can only watch the Gundam series on DVD or VHS, and are longing for the third DVD in the series, which covers episodes 11-15.  After the devilishly evil way that the producers ended episode 10, the fate of the Gundam boys hangs in the balance.  By the end of episode 15, more characters are added to the mix and the plot becomes even more complex.  Character changes that were hinted at during the first ten episodes begin to take shape.  What will happen to Heero?  Is Wing Gundam gone forever?  How will Zechs deal with his grief over the disgraceful actions taken by Lady Une?  It's all too much to bear.  Gundam Wing is lauded for its character development and plotline, and these five episodes are vital to those two components.  Give me more Gundam!",970012800,3,767,4.54014598540146
7922723,5,B00004TJGQ,"This video contains episodes 8-10. Episode 8:  The Trieze Assasination  Having been tricked by Trieze into killing the Alliance's pacifists, Wufei  and Trowa go after Trieze.  Heero, Duo, and Quatre stay behind at the New  Edwards base.  Lady Une plans to destroy the Gundams by using the  Self-detonation device at the New Edwards base.  Sally Po and her crew  intercept the transmission.  Sally informs Heero that the self-detonation  missiles have been activated.  With Quatre's help, Heero disarms and  de-activates the missiles from self-detonating.  Meanwhile, Trowa and Wufei  attack Trieze and his fleet of ships.  Trowa (inside his Gundam) ends up  under water and destroys the Cancer mobile suits.  Wufei fights Trieze in a  duel, but he loses to Trieze.  However, Trieze gives Wufei a second chance  by letting Wufei make his escape. Episode 9: Portrait of a Ruined Country  In this episode, the Tallgeese is completed, and Zechs uses it to attack  the Alliance base stationed in the Sanc Kingdom.  However, Tallgeese proves  to be more than he can handle. Tallgeese is extremely fast, and Zechs ends  up having a heart attack (don't worry he recovers just fine).  It is in  this episode where Zechs first takes off his mask revealing his true  identity.  Zechs is actually Milliardo Peacecraft. Episode 10: Heero,  distracted by defeat  In this episode, Oz has created another plan to  attract the Gundams.  Lady Une plans to transport the Taurus space mobile  suits from the Lake Victoria base to the Siberian base.  Wufei is the only  one who does not show up; he is in a state of emotional decline.  Heero,  Duo, Trowa, and Quatre show up with their Gundams. Zechs (piloting the  Tallgeese) duels with Heero in his Wing Gundam.  Trowa in his Gundam  HeavyArms gets close to attacking the Taurus suits which have arrived at  the supply base.  In a desperate move to stop the Gundams, Lady Une plans  to attack the colonies using Space fortress Barge.  Une demands that the  Gundams surrender and hand over the Gundams or else she will attack the  colonies. Zechs and Noin do not approve of Une's actions and tell her to  stop, but she doesn't.  She launches one missile.  Just then, Dr. J shows  up on all of the screens.  Dr. J surrenders, BUT he will NOT hand over the  Gundams.  Heero exits his Gundam and triggers his Gundam's Self-Detonation  device. Heero's Gundam Self-Detonates and kills Heero.  Trowa picks up  Heero's motionless body and tells the rest of the Gundam pilots to retreat.  Zechs allows the Gundams to retreat, saying ""Hurry up and Move out.  I won't attack you in a postion like this"".  Lady Une recieves a  message from Trieze; Trieze does not approve of what Lady Une was doing and  tells her to be more graceful.  In the next episod, Relena heads to Moscow  (she found out Lady Une was in Moscow) and aims her gun at Lady Une.  The  Gundams have been defeated, and no one is able to Confirm if Heero is dead  or alive.",965952000,9,2959,4.760956175298805
