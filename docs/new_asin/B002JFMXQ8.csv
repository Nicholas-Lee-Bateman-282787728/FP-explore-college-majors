8600529,5,B002JFMXQ8,"This film is very well done and is highly engaging on the important issue of immigration detention.  Whatever the viewer's position on immigration or detention more generally, it is hard not to be moved by the revelations regarding detention of toddlers and asylum seekers fleeing horrible violence in their home countries.  Immigration detention is a major policy issue and a huge investment for our government.  Yet, the public does not always have access to information regarding the more than 300,000 immigrants who are detained each year.  This film goes a long way in correcting that information deficit by providing an overview of the important issues in a balanced yet compelling way.  While it focuses on detention of entire families, the film forces reflection on other immigration detention contexts as well.  You will definitely be glad you watched this documentary!",1271980800,,878,5.280575539568345
8600530,5,B002JFMXQ8,"Whatever your opinion on immigration issues, it is important to be informed about the real-life consequences of U.S. immigration policy.  This documentary exposes the little-known (until recently) practice of detaining immigrant families and children in prison-like conditions.  The personal stories are compelling, and the indictment of the practice is forceful. Recommended to anyone willing to take a hard took at immigration issues.",1271548800,,436,6.016129032258065
8600531,5,B002JFMXQ8,"With Arizona passing tough immigration laws and Obama promising to tackle immigration reform, this touching documentary is more relevant than ever, and it nicely shows the human stories behind the policy decisions of federal and state governments.  The Least of These certainly doesn't preach to the choir on immigration.  It gives a fair and decidedly nonpartisan take on the human impact of family detention centers like the T. Don Hutto facility, and leaves the viewer to decide the best course of action.  If there is anything the film advocates for, it is transparency, public awareness, and the merits of local activism.  I would recommend it highly.",1271462400,,656,5.160377358490566
8600532,5,B002JFMXQ8,"This film is a powerful testament to the reason that we must have policies that are pro-active rather than reactive. It elucidates how our country's reactionary response to security concerns resulted in grave human rights violations for families who were already fleeing persecution when they arrived at the T. Don Hutto Detention Center. The argument that jailing refugees, rape victims and babies was necessary for our national security simply dissolves under the light of the cameras here. In the end, many of the detainees win their hard-fought claims for asylum, and they and the advocates portrayed in the film provide a victorious ending to a very upsetting story. Every American who values civil liberties and respect for human rights should see this film.",1271376000,,764,5.219512195121951
