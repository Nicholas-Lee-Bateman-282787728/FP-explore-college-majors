Tracy Ullman is to amazingly talented.
Buy this!  You won't be disappointed.",1355443200,,116,4.8
2560647,5,B000FC2HQI,"She can do just about any character.  I enjoyed this DVD.  I saw her show once on HBO on vacation, loved it, but never saw much of her after that since I don't have HBO at home. Came across her DVDs, at a really good price, so had to have them.

Ruby Romaine (like the lettuce) and the Rosenthals are just hilarious.  Either the first season or second season (can't remember which) has a skit with Ruby Romaine being abducted by aliens and one has the Rosenthals buying ostriches, hilarious.  Some of her humor is a little racist and risque but if you keep an open mind and don't take any of her characters too seriously, you will laugh your head off.  She's something else and can do almost any impersonation dead-on.",1265846400,4,718,4.401515151515151
2560648,5,B000FC2HQI,"What can I say? I've waited for this to be released, it was finally released, I love the Tracy Takes On seasons, and I can't complain. Everything that I expected it to be and a few surprises. Tracy is ""still here.""",1252713600,,214,4.2439024390243905
2560649,5,B000FC2HQI,"I would have paid ANYTHING for this DVD. It's even better than the first season. Witty witty humor. I got some HARD laughs from this DVD. I can't wait until Season 3 is released!

A must-have for any Tracey fan. And the Amazon price is 5 dollars less than HBO.com's price!",1151884800,6,272,4.333333333333333

8120770,5,B000FC2HQI,"Tracy Ullman is hilarious in her numerous character skits.  Makeup wonderfully makes her characters come to life, and she exploits those characters' personalities to a tee!  There is a bit of racy action, but milder than the more recent television programs, and it is all in good fun.
I knew one of her writers, Jerry Belson, we were in high school together in El Centro, California, and it gives me a lift to see his name in the credits.  He was always a cut-up in school and became a success in Hollywood.
If you are in the market for some belly-laughs, along with some more subtle humour, check out this dvd, you won't regret it.",1394496000,,632,4.478260869565218
