1209180,5,B00000F9CR,"This NHL production does a great job capturing the essence of what The Ducks were about in their historic run and capture of the Stanley Cup. Outstanding narration and interviews cover the season with highlights that show how good this team became under Burke's philosphy and leadership. Of course, Duck's fans will watch this sevearal times over and rejoice.  Hopefully it will be appreciated by all fans who enjoy watching a team play the game with passion, skill, and determination.",1184457600,6,485,5.0625
1209181,5,B00000F9CR,"Let's face it, most of the people who will buy this are either Anaheim Ducks fans, late-coming bandwagoners, or just fans of the greatest team sport on the planet.  For all three of those groups, most of the game footage included in the 69-minute documentary will be ""old news"", although a lot of it was shot by NHL films (cool slo-mos and whatnot), but the gems of the documentary, as well as several of the special features on the disc, are in the off-ice interviews with the players at the beginning of the year, during the playoff run, and right after the final win.  Getting to talk to these players, as well as getting to know them as human beings ""off the ice"", is really what makes this DVD a lot of fun.  And if all that is not enough, most long-time Ducks fans have been waiting for 14 years for this DVD to come out....it was well worth the wait and well worth the money.",1184112000,6,882,4.301204819277109
1209285,4,B00000F9CR,"I have discoverd one big stupid thing about this dvd collection. On the cover of each dvd, there's a game summary, with the final score in big letters. Kind of a spoiler.

I mean, you know that ultimately, Anaheim is going to win, but you don't remember the exact score of each game. I think it would have been nice to watch the games without knowing the outcome...

Other than that, it's a great collection. A piece of hockey history.",1200009600,3,435,4.425
1209286,5,B00000F9CR,the dvd is an awesome  look back at the ducks cup run last year...great way to relive the western conference and stanley cup finals,1196553600,5,131,4.458333333333333
1209287,3,B00000F9CR,I waited months for this and to find out that there were 2 number 11 dics and no number 1. Now I am told that Amazon can not redeliver for 2 weeks and may have to cancel my order. Poor quality control,1192233600,2,200,3.7857142857142856
1209288,5,B00000F9CR,"Just got mine.  It's 12 disks, not 6, with the back of the box reading, ""This 12-disc set includes the entire broadcast of every game from the Western Conference and Stanley Cup(tm) Final [11 games]. . . .  Also included, is the riveting Championship DVD, loaded with interviews, on-ice wireless, and locker room access from training camp to the Stadley Cup(tm) parade.""  OK, it wasn't much of a parade, but the rally at the Arena Formally Known as the Pond was quite an event.  I'm looking forward to reliving every moment of the Ducks first championship.",1191542400,31,556,4.760416666666667
1209289,5,B00000F9CR,"For all fans of hockey this a great DVD set with hours of hard hitting fast action.

Unfortunately for the few kings fans in Southern California this one is going to hurt forever! HAHA!

Fox wants a rivalry name......

Champs vs. Chumps

Scoreboard Kings fan!

1209290,5,B00000F9CR,"Great video to remember the wonderful moments of the Anaheim Ducks Stanley Cup championship season.  It was also great to touch the Cup during it's Orange County tour!  GO DUCKS, DO IT AGAIN.",1190160000,,191,4.757575757575758
1209291,4,B00000F9CR,"as a ducks fan from england its great to have this dvd in my collection.
with the stanley cup win fresh in people`s minds though, maybe a bit more attention could have been paid to the regular season! still its the ducks making history so its great to see. as a fan you`ve got plenty of interviews and behind the scenes to watch enjoy plus of course the post season games highlights are there as well. i`ve watched the dvd 4 times to date and it is still making the hair on the back of my neck stand up when scotty lifts the cup! this has got to be a must own for fans of the ducks and maybe worth a view for hockey fans in general, can`t wait for the ducks to come to london and make some more history.",1186531200,,703,3.99290780141844
1209292,3,B00000F9CR,"Was a bit boring - the background music annoying. Long on interviews and short on ice action footage. I'd rather see more of on and off ice practice - that gives you a better idea what the players go through to play at this level, instead of watching some guy explain the minute details of the GM's winning strategy .
Another gripe: No footage of the Stanley Cup game as in some previous editions( Carolina )
I found this to be one of the most exciting parts of the package.
Some of the close-up ice footage was nice.",1186358400,,517,4.285714285714286
1209293,2,B00000F9CR,"This is the fifth time a Stanley Cup winner has been the focus of a commerative season-in-review/playoff highlights DVD, and this years model is far and away the worst one since the first one (but to be fair, that disc, devoted to the 2001-02 Red Wings was pretty good for its time).  The 02-03 Devils disc raised the bonus features bar with selections from original playoff game broadcasts and ""hi-def"" footage from the finals, but it was the discs devoted to the 03-04 Lightning and the 05-06 Hurricane that really set a high standard--both of those discs featured the complete broadcast of the cup-clinching game as well as many other goodies. I give this disc two stars solely for the actual main feature documentary on the Ducks.  My rating would have been higher, but inexplicably...this disc has made an abrupt change from the sort of bonus material hockey fans had come to expect from past discs.

So, what do we get as bonus material on the Amaheim Ducks DVD?  Do we get any actual HOCKEY?  Nope...we get a couple of ""features"" on Andy McDonald and Dustin Penner--and another hour of unedited player interviews that are utterly lacking in any actual hockey footage whatsoever.  In fact, I would nominate the unedited Andy McDonald interview footage as possibly the lamest piece of bonus material ever.  Does McDonald offer anything interesting to say about the game of hockey or offer any insight into the Ducks playoff run?  Nope...the piece is 17 minutes of raw footage of McDonald and a couple of turkeys...that's right, the original feature (probably for NHL Cool Shots) concerned McDonald's pre-NHL job as a turkey vaccinator's assistant.  I'm not making this up--instead of the original broadcast of the cup-clinching game, we get 17 minutes of boring video of McDonald squatting on the floor with a couple of turkeys, as an off-camera Dan Moriarty prompts him with such gems as ""Talk some more about the best way to pick up a turkey...""  A three-minute ""Best Of Playoffs"" montage is about all the actual hockey action on any of this bonus material.

""Picking up a turkey"" is an appropriate metaphor for the purchase of this DVD.",1186272000,,2144,4.862637362637362
1209294,5,B00000F9CR,"Since their inception, the one time Disney owned Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were a laughing to stock to many thanks to always being associated with the Disney film of the same name.  Over a decade later with new ownership, the Ducks dropped the Mighty, got a new logo, and won their first Stanley Cup Championship.  Led by veteran defenseman, and future Hall of Famer, Scott Niedermayer, the Ducks stormed their way through the regular season and playoffs until triumphing over the Ottawa Senators in the Cup Finals; all of which is captured on this DVD.  Seeing Niedermayer pass the Cup to his brother Rob is one of the best moments captured to be during the celebratory passing and raising; but it's seeing legendary Teemu Selanne and goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguiere (who won the Conn Smythe in 2003 in the Ducks' playoff defeat at the hands of Scott Stevens and the New Jersey Devils) finally get what they deserve and raise the Cup high.  All in all, this DVD is a must own for Ducks fans and pure NHL fans alike, and it goes without saying that the Ducks' victory is more than deserved and fitting as well.",1185235200,7,1111,4.653061224489796

7907959,4,B00000F9CR,"Before the season begun I predicted the Ducks would win the Stanley Cup. Just looking at there roster, it was hard to argue with all the talent they had. Sure they went there a slump here and there, but they came out on top. Good job, its too bad I didn't bet money on it. The Ducks however won't be repeating anytime soon. They traded there great young talent away for merely nothing and got jack in return. Its too bad because ive seen the Ducks minor league team and there was some budding superstars in the making and they traded them away for next to nothing. If Redwings can win with veterans, maybe the Ducks can repeat. Just maybe, for now this is the besy way to revisit the glory of winning the Cup.",1201996800,,709,4.2592592592592595
