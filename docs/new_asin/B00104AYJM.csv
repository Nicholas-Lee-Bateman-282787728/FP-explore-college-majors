First of all, while digitally enhanced, they forgot to take out the scratches from the original film and to correct the muddy audio. If the story were interesting, I guess I could have tolerated the poor quality.

This is a stereotypical Italian spaghetti western of the poorest sort, made in 1968 at the height of the fad. It includes unknown actors, horrible dubbing with no attempt to synch with the actor's lips, lots of unattractive sneering bad guys, all heavily caked with fake tans and haphazardly applied dirt, a buxom, spotlessly clean barmaid who is barely staying in her costume and speaks with an Italian accent, and an improbably handsome wagon guide, who I suspect is the lead actor, though I haven't a clue who he is.

As such, I cannot comment on the audio or picture quality of the films as they appear on this Alpha Home Entertainment disc.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the films only.

It seems like both of these films should be better than they are.  There is some entertainment value here - mostly for Italian western junkies - but really, both these films are unremarkable.

'Between God, The Devil and a Winchester' (aka  'God Was in the West, Too, at One Time') stars the uber-suave Gilbert Roland as Juan Chasquisdo, a stand-in for Long John Silver, and Richard Harrison taking on the Doctor Livesey character in this adaptation of 'Treasure Island' set in the old west of the 1880's.  The script follows the classic tale fairly close, with allowances for setting and time period, although there are a few other variations.  Not knowing anything about the film before watching, it was a surprise when I recognized the source behind the film, and I still think it should have worked better then it did.  Substitute a long wagon trek into forbidding mountains for the sea voyage, and Mexican bandits for the scurvy crew of pirates bidding their time to get their hands on a hidden treasure, and it should add up to fun diversion, Italian western style.

Somehow, though, the pay-off just isn't very exciting.  By the time the final third of the film rolled around, it seemed as though the series of crosses, double-crosses and greedy motivations that highlighted the original story were flat and dutiful rather than suspenseful.  Whether this had to do with familiarity or because the director lost control over the pacing, I can't be sure, though I suspect one part of it was the effort to remove some of the ambiguity from the Silver character.  The intent is to keep the viewer guessing about Gilbert Roland, and whose side he's on, but in the end, he is much clearer morally than Long John ever was.

Gilber Roland is definitely the star here - he makes this role look effortless despite the scrambled storyline, and Raf Baldasarre has a minor but energetic role he gives his all toward.  Others, including Harrison and Humberto Sempere as the Jim substitute, are average at best, which is pretty standard for these films.  All in all, an interesting idea that fails to follow through.

'Boot Hill', on the other hand, is a generic story of an unscrupulous mining company trying to frighten honest, hardworking miners into selling their claims, and of the unlikely heroes that band together to save the common folks.  What might lead one to believe that this effort could have been above average is the cast - Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer, Woody Strode, Lionel Stander, Victor Buono (Batman's King Tut), and a few other faces no doubt familiar to Italian western fans, such as Alberto Dell'Acqua and Luca Montefiori.  Unfortunately, this film, like its companion, never comes together, despite its stable of competent actors.

At the request of an old friend, Terence Hill enlists the help of Bud Spencer to break the hold Buono and his gang have over a mining community.  Along the way, Lionel Stander and Woody Strode, as part of a traveling circus, get drawn into the mix when Strode's young protege is murdered by the gang.  In a unnecessarily complex ending, the miners, the circus performers and the two gunmen team-up to rid the county of Buono's influence, with predictable results.

What sinks this film is an over-reliance on the typecasting of the actors.  Each and every one of the stars act exactly as you would expect them to if you had seen any other movie they were involved in.  It's almost as if there wasn't a script at all, or only the bare outlines of one - the actors just played their roles as they'd done dozens of other times.  To me, this takes away the strongest element of Italian filmmaking - the chance of completely bizarre scenarios and unexpected events popping up even in generic plots.  Using the reputation of the actors as a shortcut to storytelling is one of the major problems with big-budget American films - Italian films from the sixties and seventies, even with their production problems, at least hold out the promise of originality.  'Boot Hill' (aka 'Trinity Rides Again' though that's disengenious at best - this isn't a Trinity film) seems uninspired and unoriginal even after discounting problems that plague most Italian Westerns (poor dubbing, questionable acting, convoluted scripts).  Together with 'Between God, The Devil and a Winchester', these are below average films from the time and place, and are only recommended for Italian western enthusiasts who have seen most everything else.

This Alpha release list 73 minutes as the run time, so prospective buyers should be warned that _something_ is off-kilter here.  The total run time for both these films should be closer to the three hour mark, as the versions of the two films that I watched were both over 90 minutes.  The prints that are available on the '20 Great Western' compilation discs are poor, washed out, and full of artifacts, but are entirely watchable.

Unfortunately, TGG, the makers of '20 Great' set, opted to cram five movies on each side of a disc, so pixellation problems are unavoidable.",1313712000,,5784,5.1431623931623935
3045342,2,B00104AYJM,"Several problems plague this overlong, tedious flick.  For one, it takes an ideal premise and draws it out interminably as to make it excruciating.  Also, your protagonists are a motley, poorly-rendered bunch for the most part.

The story is a basic rework of TREASURE ISLAND.  Transpose a literary classic to a new genre, I get it.  Should be fun, right?  A boy whose family runs a boarding house discovers a treasure map hidden by a traveling bounty hunter.  The boy, along with his own old uncle, a dapper caballero, and a wandering preacher, set out across the mountains to find the gold.  They must fight off a gang of roving bandits as well as their own paranoia and suspicions of each other.  The story seems to take forever to get started, and once the crew gets started on their trek to find the treasure, nothing really happens for the next hour til the inevitable showdown.

An action/adventure film like this that centers around a little boy is going to rise and fall on the performance of the boy, and here, young Humberto Sempere as Tony is sniveling, wide-eyed, unlikeable.  Plus, he is voiced in a shrill, broad manner by an obviously adult female actor.  That alone kills the vibe of the flick from the get-go.  Similarly, the boy's uncle is given a ""goofy"" characterization which is truly grating.  Among the other leads is the blank-faced American Richard Harrison as Pat the Preacher, who has very limited, Chuck Norris-esque range, and who doesn't even show up until 30 minutes into the show.  The best of the cast is the super-classy, mucho macho Gilbert Roland.  Imagine the Dos Equis Guy with a pencil-thin John Waters-style mustache and a gaudy vest, that's him!  Roland is dignified and sympathetic in all his parts, and to this one he brings subtle shadings to a shady gunslinger that is at heart a decent man.

Aside from Roland's performance, the other part of the film I enjoyed is the initial setup featuring bounty killer Folco Lulli coming into town, scoping out his next mark, killing an informant and an outlaw along the way.  Lulli's character, however is killed off pretty quickly, setting the scene for annoying Tony to find the map and begin the main thrust of the pic's story.

Maybe the original Italian cut of this film favors the actors better than the English dub, but even if that's so, you'd still have to deal with the tedious pacing and lack of action.  For the English dub anyway, I call it a generous 5/10 stars.

3045363,3,B00104AYJM,"BETWEEN GOD, THE DEVIL AND A WINCHESTER

Released in 1968 and directed by Marino Girolami, Between God, the Devil and a Winchester (originally titled God Was in the West, Too, at One Time) is an Italo oater starring Richard Harrison as a pacifist in the Southwest who obtains a map from a boy that leads to a treasure allegedly stolen from a mission. Several other people want the treasure too, like Juan Chasquisdo (Gilbert Roland), but likely for less noble purposes. The storys (supposedly) based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, which Ive never read.

Between God, the Devil and a Winchester has the limitations of most Spaghetti Westerns, like dubious dubbing, awkward editing, laughable sound effects and caricatures rather than characters. But, if you can look beyond these flaws, it has several attributes, like the noble Harrison as the protagonist, which is in contrast to the amoral characters (caricatures) typical of Italian oaters.

The first act takes place at a Western Inn and is highlighted by the stunning Dominique Boschero as Marta. Dominique is so breathtaking shes almost worth the price of admission; unfortunately, shes removed from the story by the end of the first act. Roland as Chasquisdo is memorable, if for no other reason than the iron gauntlet on one hand.

The next two acts involve searching for and finding the treasure and aren't as good as the opening act. For one, there are a few nighttime sequences that are too dark to tell whats happening. But the ending is decent and satisfying. Too bad they omitted Marta from the last two acts.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Spain.

GRADE: C+

=========================

BOOT HILL

Released in 1969 and directed/written by Giuseppe Colizzi, ""Boot Hill"" stars Terence Hill as Cat Stevens, a hunted and wounded man who hooks up with a circus troupe and the oppressed citizens of a small town in the Southwest to take on Honey Fisher (Victor Buono) and his murderous gang who corruptly gain leases on valuable gold-yielding land in the area. Woody Strode plays one of the trapeze artists.

There are several things I appreciate about this movie. For one, Terrence Hill is as good or better than Clint Eastwood and it's surprising that he didn't become more popular. Secondly, the traveling circus sets this movie apart from other Westerns. Thirdly, it's nice to see a black character in a Western as one of the protagonists; not to mention, there's another peripheral black character. I can only think of two other Westerns off the top of my head that have done this (not including Mario Van Peebles' Posse from 1993): Duel at Diablo from 1966, with Sidney Poitier, and The Gatling Gun from 1971, also with Strode. Fourthly, there's a cool Ennio Morricone-like score by Carlo Rustichelli.

On the negative side, the story's kinda muddled and the circus girls aren't as prominent as they should be. In fact, the latter is made out to be a joke when the high wire act starts to perform and the audience boos because they're all male, lol. I also don't like the title ""Boot Hill"" because I can't figure out why it's the name of the movie; I'm assuming it's the name of the main town in the story, which they should've made clearer at some point.

The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in Almera, Andaluca, Spain.

3279839,2,B00104AYJM,"Several problems plague this overlong, tedious flick.  For one, it takes an ideal premise and draws it out interminably as to make it excruciating.  Also, your protagonists are a motley, poorly-rendered bunch for the most part.

The story is a basic rework of TREASURE ISLAND.  Transpose a literary classic to a new genre, I get it.  Should be fun, right?  A boy whose family runs a boarding house discovers a treasure map hidden by a traveling bounty hunter.  The boy, along with his own old uncle, a dapper caballero, and a wandering preacher, set out across the mountains to find the gold.  They must fight off a gang of roving bandits as well as their own paranoia and suspicions of each other.  The story seems to take forever to get started, and once the crew gets started on their trek to find the treasure, nothing really happens for the next hour til the inevitable showdown.

An action/adventure film like this that centers around a little boy is going to rise and fall on the performance of the boy, and here, young Humberto Sempere as Tony is sniveling, wide-eyed, unlikeable.  Plus, he is voiced in a shrill, broad manner by an obviously adult female actor.  That alone kills the vibe of the flick from the get-go.  Similarly, the boy's uncle is given a ""goofy"" characterization which is truly grating.  Among the other leads is the blank-faced American Richard Harrison as Pat the Preacher, who has very limited, Chuck Norris-esque range, and who doesn't even show up until 30 minutes into the show.  The best of the cast is the super-classy, mucho macho Gilbert Roland.  Imagine the Dos Equis Guy with a pencil-thin John Waters-style mustache and a gaudy vest, that's him!  Roland is dignified and sympathetic in all his parts, and to this one he brings subtle shadings to a shady gunslinger that is at heart a decent man.

Aside from Roland's performance, the other part of the film I enjoyed is the initial setup featuring bounty killer Folco Lulli coming into town, scoping out his next mark, killing an informant and an outlaw along the way.  Lulli's character, however is killed off pretty quickly, setting the scene for annoying Tony to find the map and begin the main thrust of the pic's story.

Maybe the original Italian cut of this film favors the actors better than the English dub, but even if that's so, you'd still have to deal with the tedious pacing and lack of action.  For the English dub anyway, I call it a generous 5/10 stars.

3279860,3,B00104AYJM,"BETWEEN GOD, THE DEVIL AND A WINCHESTER

Released in 1968 and directed by Marino Girolami, Between God, the Devil and a Winchester (originally titled God Was in the West, Too, at One Time) is an Italo oater starring Richard Harrison as a pacifist in the Southwest who obtains a map from a boy that leads to a treasure allegedly stolen from a mission. Several other people want the treasure too, like Juan Chasquisdo (Gilbert Roland), but likely for less noble purposes. The storys (supposedly) based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, which Ive never read.

Between God, the Devil and a Winchester has the limitations of most Spaghetti Westerns, like dubious dubbing, awkward editing, laughable sound effects and caricatures rather than characters. But, if you can look beyond these flaws, it has several attributes, like the noble Harrison as the protagonist, which is in contrast to the amoral characters (caricatures) typical of Italian oaters.

The first act takes place at a Western Inn and is highlighted by the stunning Dominique Boschero as Marta. Dominique is so breathtaking shes almost worth the price of admission; unfortunately, shes removed from the story by the end of the first act. Roland as Chasquisdo is memorable, if for no other reason than the iron gauntlet on one hand.

The next two acts involve searching for and finding the treasure and aren't as good as the opening act. For one, there are a few nighttime sequences that are too dark to tell whats happening. But the ending is decent and satisfying. Too bad they omitted Marta from the last two acts.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Spain.

BOOT HILL

Released in 1969 and directed/written by Giuseppe Colizzi, ""Boot Hill"" stars Terence Hill as Cat Stevens, a hunted and wounded man who hooks up with a circus troupe and the oppressed citizens of a small town in the Southwest to take on Honey Fisher (Victor Buono) and his murderous gang who corruptly gain leases on valuable gold-yielding land in the area. Woody Strode plays one of the trapeze artists.

There are several things I appreciate about this movie. For one, Terrence Hill is as good or better than Clint Eastwood and it's surprising that he didn't become more popular. Secondly, the traveling circus sets this movie apart from other Westerns. Thirdly, it's nice to see a black character in a Western as one of the protagonists; not to mention, there's another peripheral black character. I can only think of two other Westerns off the top of my head that have done this (not including Mario Van Peebles' Posse from 1993): Duel at Diablo from 1966, with Sidney Poitier, and The Gatling Gun from 1971, also with Strode. Fourthly, there's a cool Ennio Morricone-like score by Carlo Rustichelli.

On the negative side, the story's kinda muddled and the circus girls aren't as prominent as they should be. In fact, the latter is made out to be a joke when the high wire act starts to perform and the audience boos because they're all male, lol. I also don't like the title ""Boot Hill"" because I can't figure out why it's the name of the movie; I'm assuming it's the name of the main town in the story, which they should've made clearer at some point.

The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in Almera, Andaluca, Spain.
