4660849,3,B005DKS1X0,"Not really a bad movie.  If one watches one of these things and has a clue what they are likely to be, one isn't disappointed.
I wasn't.  They hacked, and wacked, and shot and killed just as I expected.  There were tricky martial arts moves and
stupid speeches (now if you are a bit actor and you get to say something, of course you are going to ham it up and make the
most of it--it's your big chance).  And the script was not one that will be translated into many languages and taught as a
standard at universities--but then if you could write that well you shouldn't be writing a script for one of these.  As it was, it
was adequate for the purpose and provided motive, sequence of action, connection from one scene to another, etc.  And even
a little (little enough) character development.  So if you like to watch this kind of thing, watch this one.",1470700800,,854,4.333333333333333

4660851,4,B005DKS1X0,"This is an odd oriental western post apocalyptic grindhouse with a decent soundtrack. The American west (maybe more) has been devastated from some unnamed tragedy that has contaminated the land and created mutants. Most of the people are attempting to go to a government train so they can be taken back east where everything is fresh and clean.

There is a ""religious"" group of hombres who want to cleanse the land through rape, pillage, plunder, and a bit of cannibalism, all for the greater good. In the opening scene, they rape and kill a woman, kidnap the son and shoot the husband multiple times...but he didn't die. 17 years later he (Garret Sato as Keo) is alive and seeking this group for revenge and he wants to get his son back, although we have been told he was eaten...and was very tasty. The movie sometimes has a comedy tone to it as demonstrated by a man in the desert complaining his 60 Lou Rawls albums being stolen by hombres. The human mutants travel underground like the sand-worms in ""Dune.""

One of the members of the church, Charm (Erin Laurence) is a Sherie Moon Zombie type who delights in bad things and prays during the first rape. She is perfect for a grindhouse and is clearly under utilized.

Although it is 17 years later, no one looks older. The movie has some really horrible, downright campy acting and dialouge which actually made the film more enjoyable. It boasts 5 pretty oriental women showing off their legs. Derrel Maury (Mario from ""Joanie Loves Chachi"") is Caine who leads the religious cult group.

F-bombs, rape, no nudity, minor blood and gore. A movie clearly not for everyone.",1321142400,3,1624,4.707746478873239
4660852,3,B005DKS1X0,"Set in a post apocalyptic Mad Max style landscape, Wasteland starts out very slowly. Literally a turtle walks by in the opening credits! The camera angles are tight on said turtle, and obviously well directed by Kantz, our turtle carefully saunters off screen, this reptile knows his cue, and even has an encore appearance later in the film. This is an obvious metaphor for the journey which is in front of Keo Tanaka (Garret T. Sato). Keo witnessed his family murdered and sets out on an quest to find the man responsible.

This Wasteland is full of an amalgamation of crazy things. There are mutants who burrow underground and leave a trail like not unlike the sandworms in Dune. In addition to these mutants are The Lee Sisters who are a much cuter and softer form of danger! They like to wisecrack, shoot guns, and sneer. Actress Sherry Shaoling stands out in the group with her commanding voice. One of Lee Sisters grabs a guy's ballsack and says ""you don't have the equipment I am looking for."". My question, where does one obtain this equipment, Amazon? There is a maniacal priestess played with feral energy by Heidi Marie, her character should have been given more screen time, she had some intensity to her, she brought some passion. With this kind of madness standing in his way, Keo's journey is full of peril.

The story progresses with a mish-mash of martial arts style fight scenes, interspersed with gunfire as Mr Sato dispatches the bad characters. The final twenty minutes gets a bit more serious and there is a nice twist at the end.

Wasteland is well shot and edited. The sets, camera angles and lighting obviously were well planned and professional for an ultra-low budget film with a very short shooting schedule. I cannot say the same for the consistency of the acting, I hoped for a bit more natural behavior from some of them, loosen up, let the character flow, don't just read the lines. Lead actor Garret T. Sato seems kind of mellow and understated for a guy surviving 17 years in the desert.

Despite some uninspired acting I rate Wasteland a 3 out of 5 a definite rent, and possible purchase if you like low budget action. I am looking forward to see what is coming out of twisted the mind of writer/producer/Kantz!

Wasteland is currently available for purchase nationwide.",1319241600,,2305,4.723880597014926
