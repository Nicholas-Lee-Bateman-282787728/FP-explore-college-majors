8083607,3,B000B8TIK4,"This movie seemed far more sophomoric to me than it obviously did to the other viewers.  Evasive Action?  Hardly.  It's more like Avoid Reasonable.  Second, third and fourth-rate actors work their way through this fifth rate movie with cut rate dialog.

The premise is simple enough.  A hanfdful of convicts escape from a prison train car to take over the train and make their way to Mexico.  After that, well, it's pretty lame.  Clint Howard's character has absolutely no need to even be there.",1486080000,,495,4.809523809523809
8083608,5,B000B8TIK4,"Well just when we thought the ultimate combination of Don Swayze and Chad Mcqueen couldn't be challenged we were proven very wrong thanks to the Ice Cream Man himself Clint Howard. Given it would be a bit overly generous to say Clint and Don are the greater combo but do provide a very close level of enjoyment. It's just a very pleasing thought to know we're still able to stumble across a great action packed 90's Swayze B nearly 15 years after our first encounter in the world renowned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>. We have to admit a bit of envy towards the only other reviewer who actually worked on the set. Bless you our friend for being placed on the same set with the mighty Don Swayze.

In Evasive action starring the guy from Jaws/now super B actor Roy Scheider (a mafia crime boss), Don Swayze (an explosives expert..yeah ok), and Clint Howard (an utterly insane killer) we are introduced to a very rough group of inmates on their way to be transported to a jail built to hold their super B powers. Naturally when transporting these lunatics you place them on a train with normal citizens ensuring the viewer something wonderful is about to go down. Once on the train mafiosa Roy Scheider has his outside crew bust the convicts loose turning the train to the ultimate battle of good vs. B evil. About half way through it became apparent where the plot from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege-2-Dark-Territory-Snap-Case/dp/6304712898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (Snap Case)</a>&nbsp;was lifted from...sorry Seagal you know it's true. Really a film that every Don Swayze advocate should get his hands on.

For the first time in many years we witnessed a movie containing the most Swayze on screen time since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-to-Burn-VHS/dp/6303945457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money to Burn [VHS</a>], which still hasn't been released on DVD. It was a performance filled with the usual freakish gun firing facial contortions we almost wet ourselves over in 1993 during the first viewing on Death Ring. On top of that when you sprinkle a barely coherent Clint Howard in the mix you've already placed yourself in a position to cruise through a 5 star rating with a Woody Award nomination soon to follow. The only downside to Evasive action is it leaves you hungry for more and more 90's B action which simply can't be met in this day and age. This is one meant to watch no earlier then 12:30 am on a Saturday night with a nice coffee and loads of snacks.",1294099200,,2721,5.4454976303317535
8083609,4,B000B8TIK4,"I enjoyed this movie but I'm a little biased. I worked on the film. There were some great moments in the making of it and I enjoyed every one of them as well as the people I worked with. There were also some very tough days as any of the talent would tell you. Dorian and Ray and Ed and Roy were a lot of fun to get to know and talk with. Dorian kept mostly in his trailor working on his music. This movie was made 5 years ago, or so. So I was thrilled to see it released here in the states.

It's a quick, quirky movie. The editing is a little weak but that may not be the editor's fault. There were some tough shots/spots to piece together. I enjoyed the Director. He is a hard worker and a patient fella... that's him at the end releaving the train monitor position. I worked on the Production team and they used me as a guard. I'm the guard that walks him into the prison at the beginning and out at the end. It was hard work but fun.",1137715200,2,938,3.9368421052631577
