8474859,4,B005ION4TC,Exploitation like they just don't make 'm anymore. Code Red took two little-known secploitationers and gave us a highly entertaining mixture of software sex and drama.,1385683200,,167,5.461538461538462
8474860,5,B005ION4TC,"This is what I'd call an awesome dvd release! Two classic (IMO) exploitation films that take ya right back to the drive in days. Teenage Tramp is so beautiful and beat up looking and while some complain about seeing scratches on a film, I love it and actually can't stand when the films are sharp looking like typical Hollywood garbage. Teenage Hitchhikers is a total blast!! Kind of a parody of the exploitation films of it's time frame and I loved every minute of it! Another excellent release from Code Red and I hope they're continue to release these type of exploitation films!",1336608000,5,582,4.660194174757281
