8392282,5,B0039TMYLW,I have around 10 movies adapted from Edgar Wallace's pen.  They are all good but I must say The Door With 7 Locks is my preferred number 1.,1407542400,,139,3.9642857142857144
8392283,5,B0039TMYLW,"Finally these  two minor British classics see a quality release.  Sadly, these two gems have fallen into the public domain here in the USA and have appeared in countless horror DVD collections under their US release titles: THE HUMAN MONSTER and CHAMBER OF HORRORS.  These versions sport the original British title sequences.  The image quality is excellent for British films of this vintage.  The soundtracks of both have not been restored and have some hiss, but quite audible.

A word of warning:  This is a DVD-R dual layer double feature, but is well authored. Highly recommended.",1387411200,,585,5.03125
