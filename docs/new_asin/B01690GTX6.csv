7463838,1,B01690GTX6,"Kellie Martin looks old, she should have acted as the mother in law instead of the bride. In fact in the movie she looks far much older than the groom and the mother in law. I understand that Hallmark wanted to portray her as a mature woman but then there shouldn't have been any close ups nor short or sleeveless dresses.
 Witt although is the same age as Martin looks younger and would have been a better choice for the role. Instead witt worked in a Hallmark Christmas movie where she played the part of Santa Claus (not Mrs. Claus). The part Witt played should have been done by a man, in reality there are men who are single parents.
Hallmark is trying to produce movies as fast as possible, therefore making many mistakes with the casting, stories and wardrobe.",1453334400,4,767,4.478571428571429
7463839,5,B01690GTX6,"Great movie, enjoyed it on the Hallmark Channel.  Kellie Martin is an excellent actress and the story was very cute.  I recommend the movie to all who like Hallmark movies.",1453161600,2,172,4.7
7463840,4,B01690GTX6,"This was pretty much the standard sweet, clean Hallmark fare, which I enjoy watching with my young teen daughter, who enjoys them more than I do.  A surprise was the character of the mother/mother-in-law-to-be, who was likeable and pretty and ""human"" and not as stereotypical as some other movies.  Ditto for the character of the ex girlfriend, who was atypical as well.",1452643200,11,370,4.951612903225806
7463841,5,B01690GTX6,"This was a movie that was fun to watch. The enjoyment comes from the story line and actors.

Kelly Martin does a great job playing Annabelle, an owner of a bridal shop. .She loves vintage clothes and has a good eye for choosing wedding attire. In walks a handsome man who she becomes involved with although they are very different. However his mother owns a rival high end wedding shop in the same town.

The movie is funny. As you see the main characters' love bloom , you also see the mother of the man Annabelle loves creating havoc. It makes you wonder if the couple will be able to resolve issues and become a couple in marriage.

As in all good Hallmark movies, there is resolution between the characters. It is interesting to see how the rivalry disappears and acceptance is acquired. It makes you believe that opposites do attract and can find happiness.

7463842,5,B01690GTX6,"Kellie Martin stars in this fun and sweet Hallmark sweetheart story that was a lead-up to Valentine 2015.  In the story, Ms. Martin plays Annabel Blanche. She is about to open a vintage wedding dress shop in a town that already has a well-established wedding store. The owner of the other shop, Claire (Jennifer Dale) is less than enthusiastic about welcoming a competing business.  The run-ins between these two are really funny and happen again and again throughout the movie.

Annabel meets a young lawyer, Sam Taylor (Chad Willet) and sparks begin to fly between the two of them. Imagine how surprised Annabel is when she discovers that the man she is falling for is none other than the son of her competitor, Claire.

Bruce Boxleitner plays Annabel's father, Nick Blanche,and it is a real pleasure to see him in a movie on Hallmark.  I've enjoyed his work for years.

Ms. Martin (and her beautiful vintage wardrobe) is the central part of this movie for me.  I so enjoy watching her and have for many years.  I've seen a number of Hallmark movies starring her in recent years and am happy to see that she is making at home for herself at the channel.

The movie is, of course given its rotation at Valentine's Day, a sweetheart romance.  I appreciate the fact that I can sit down to a Hallmark movie with my kids and grandkids and not have to fast forward through parts or have to stop and explain something I would rather not.",1447200000,18,1432,4.580392156862745

7463847,1,B01690GTX6,The main actress is really not watchable. She looks old and tired and has no sparkle. This made the movie unwatchable. Will be throwing this DVD out.,1491782400,,149,4.555555555555555
7463848,5,B01690GTX6,"This was enjoyable to watch.  I am a fan of Kelli Martin and Bruce Boxlietner (hope I spelled them right).  I am also a fan of many things vintage so the story line was interesting to me.  The variety of characters and the way they related to each other was fairly believable which made the whole movie fun and kind of sweet, as well as a cute romance!

7463878,4,B01690GTX6,"I liked the story line and enjoyed the characters, especially Sam. He was kind and unselfish, and he was respectful to his mother even though she was awful until her change near the end.  There was no serious arrogance or deceitfulness by the characters. How refreshing. Acting was good.  The only thing that drove me crazy was Kelly Martin's appearance.  Kelly is a very attractive woman, so why on earth did Hallmark insist on portraying her looks as they did?  She looked old and haggard with chopped-off-by-an-ax-stick-out hair.  Her hair was horrible, and I think the mother-in-law got it right when she called it a ""bedhead bob.""  I understand they were trying to give her an unconventional look to match her unconventional character, but that was no excuse to make her so unattractive!  When you watch romantic movies, you want to see an attractive couple fall in love. They don't have to be drop-dead gorgeous, just attractive. Kelly's character was attractive on the inside, so why on earth didn't the producers allow her to be attractive on the outside too?  I found it really distracting, and I kept hoping that they would fix her hair in the next scene.  It never happened.  I saw another Kelly Martin movie in which Hallmark did the same thing with her.  Get with it Hallmark!  Give the poor girl a nice hairdo, and make her as attractive as she is in real life!",1459987200,10,1375,4.707112970711297

The movie is written without flaw...Timing is impeccable....This is my go to movie when I not sure what I want to watch because this one is always watchable....The only snag is the actress who plays ""Beverly"".  Not a fan...Other than that this movie is perfect.....Highly recommend viewing and owning this one.  It is definitely a keeper.  Love the actress who plays the future mother-in-law.  She reminds me of Jackie Kennedy only more beautiful and she is a wonderful actress who I hope to see in more coming attractions from Hallmark.....Please, please do more movies (plural) with this cast and these characters....Would love to see this couple with kids and the interaction between them with the grandmother (Sam's mom).",1532995200,,857,5.035460992907802

8735897,5,B01690GTX6,"Kellie Martin rules in this Hallmark production. She is the owner of a vintage bridal shop who meets a man trying to tell her her car is being towed as he is on his way to the golf course. She also presents a threat to another bridal shop across the way. Sam and Annabelle begin a subtle courtship that evolves into love as he narrowly misses her finding out from two other encounters with two other acquaintances that his mother just happens to own the EVER AFTER bridal shop: her competition. While things do not go well with the mother I will say the character of Sams mother is a very sweet and beautiful woman who loves her son and just wants the best for him. I am not into yoga, Buddhism, Tibetan food or mythical gods but I do so enjoy a good story where love wins out, respect is gained and all goes well at the end. Lovely dresses and styles to enjoy, yummy looking food to dream about tasting, and as always with me, it is my joy to learn something new about the writing styles and character studies and different cultures.
Just keep an open mind and sit back and enjoy Kellie Martin in another production by Hallmark. Enjoy!!",1523059200,,1137,4.342723004694836
