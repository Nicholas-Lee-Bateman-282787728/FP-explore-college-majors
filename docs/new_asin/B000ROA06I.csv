2871569,4,B000ROA06I,Let me just say WOW. I love this DVD. I just bought it. Kelley has become my new work-out partner. This work is intense and I will say it is an intermediate routine. You will get an good workout using this DVD.,1236124800,,210,4.023809523809524
2871570,5,B000ROA06I,"I own both her Step-Boxing DVDs I love this one because it's about 45 minutes of pure Cardio and perfect if you don't have more than an hour to spare on a busy schedule. However, it does have more weight/cardio after the pure cardio if you do have the time.
I use it before work.  I do the 45 minutes and then shower and head off, it energizes my entire day.
This workout is intense, and it is a complete burn. It may not be for beginners.",1235779200,5,439,4.045977011494253
2871571,4,B000ROA06I,"I bought this DVD because I love step and kickboxing and figured a combination of the two would be great.  I wasn't disappointed.  The very first time I did this workout, I was surprised by how fast it is.  I had a pretty hard time keeping up and thought maybe I had made a bad purchase.  The second time I tried it, it was incredibly easier.  I remembered the choreography from before and followed along with relative ease.  It was still a tough workout and I was sweating like crazy.  But now I'm hooked and this has quickly become a favorite.  Kelly offers excellent variety and you move so fast, you can't get bored.",1232236800,8,620,4.37719298245614
2871572,5,B000ROA06I,"This workout was a lot of fun.  It was pretty easy to catch on to the moves (not too complex) and although short, I enjoyed the little bit of cardio/weights at the end.  I love Kelly's workouts, I have every one of them.  I would definitely recommend this workout.",1223769600,,264,4.346938775510204
2871573,3,B000ROA06I,"This is a challenging workout.  Please do not buy this if you are not able to do high impact moves.  This workout is fast, very fast for step aerobics, and all of the moves are propulsion moves.  All of them.  This woman bounces with every step.  Kelly is energetic, very good at what she does, and the workout is a probably great for people who already know how to  kick-box and do advanced step aerobics.  However, I do step aerobics because I have a bad knee, and can not do any high impact moves.  I did this work-out once, working to modify each move.  However, that is a lot of trouble, and it makes more sense to simply buy a DVD with a step routine that I can do.",1208476800,29,671,4.1395348837209305
2871574,4,B000ROA06I,"This video is really fun, but definately not for beginners of either type of work out.  Kelly does a great job of cueing you through the routine but it is very fast paced.  It would be most enjoyable if you have a knowledge of step aerobics and at least some knowledge with kickboxing type workouts.  Once you get it down it is a lot of fun and definately a change of pace!",1203292800,4,373,4.152777777777778
2871575,5,B000ROA06I,"This is my first workout by Kelly.  She's a great instructor, - outgoing and fun and very fit.  She never slows down even to give the cues; she does it pretty effortlessly.
This is really a combination of step aerobics and kickboxing and so you can imagine that this is intense.  You burn fat and drip sweat from start to finish.  Within regular step movements, you are doing kickboxing type moves (ie punches and jabs and kicks).  There is an aerobic/toning portion and that is tough because your heart stays elevated because it's done at a fairly fast speed and intensity.  After you've done this workout a couple of times it definately gets a little easier, but I tell you that if you stick to it, it will give you results for sure.
Based on this workout, I'll definately buy more dvds of Kellys.  She's good at what she does and she makes this fun even though you're continuously working hard.  I really like this one.",1196899200,12,922,4.5120481927710845
2871596,4,B000ROA06I,"I'm not use to using a step, but if you are then this is a good hard class for you! Enjoy I'm going to keep at it until I can do without stopping to catch my breath and balance!",1361836800,,177,3.5641025641025643
2871597,5,B000ROA06I,I love step and I love kick-boxing!  Who knew to put the two together.  I do this video a lot and will continue it forever! :)  It has high and low impact options.  Anyone can do it because there isn't much in the cheoreography area.  Kelly is not big into that.  You will love it too!,1358121600,,285,4.0
2871598,4,B000ROA06I,"At first the video was too fast paced to learn the moves and workout effectively to it.  Then a week and a half later, after working out to it 4 to 5 days a week, I finally picked it up and now it's kicking my butt.  I've only mastered 20 minutes at a time so far.  My goal is to get through all the workouts without pausing for air :)

Kelly keeps you moving the entire time so this is not a DVD for people not totally in the mindset for a workout.

Great DVD, I would highly suggest it!",1320710400,,488,3.84
2871599,4,B000ROA06I,This workout is great. You get a good sweat and the instructor is pretty consistant. It is fast paced so beginners will probably have to do it a couple times before catching on but it is so worth it.,1308700800,,199,4.128205128205129
2871600,4,B000ROA06I,"Kelly is the fastest instructor I have ever seen! Here's what to expect: extremely fast; so fast that keeping up with the next move is impossible at first. I'm fit and fast but the prompts are not adequate to jump in and go the first time around. Her strategy is effective and I believe I am burning more calories with this set than any others I have been using (P90X, Various FIRM videos, Charlene, and some others). Because of the pace at which she changes moves, I am having to go into each individual segment and repetitively do them until ""I get it"" then go to the next segment. It will take me a week of focusing on the 'hows and what's next' in order to be able to workout with the video from the beginning to end without getting lost and confused. This may sound ridiculous, however, I believe this video set is worth it! You'll burn the calories, shred the fat, and look better in a jiff if you just keep plugging with this set. I have 25 lbs to go... I'll keep you posted on the progress. I'm sticking with Kelly's step-boxing set while I'm trying to shred because I believe I am burning 1,000 calories or close to it.

I gave it a 4 because there wasn't any introduction to slowly show the steps. I thought more effort to prepare us could have been added to the video.",1295568000,13,1279,4.285123966942149
2871601,5,B000ROA06I,"I love this workout!  Kelly is the most energetic instructor I've seen (and I have over 100 workout DVDs from the likes of Cathe Friedrich, Amy Bento and Tracey Staehle).

This workout is not for the faint of heart though.  The music has a very fast beat and Kelly doesn't spend a lot of time breaking down the moves.  She will show a few steps of the routine and then build from there.  This is exactly how I like to learn new steps.

I didn't think this routine was particularly high impact, like some of the other reviewers.  You could always lower your step height to one riser on each side, or even no risers, if you wanted less impact.  One of the background exercisers is showing lower impact modifications as well.

I consider this workout was more of a step routine, with a few kickboxing moves thrown in.  It's still fun.  The quick weight routine at the end was a nice way to keep your heart rate up too.  I normally don't like this type of weight work, but it's nice for a change.

I would recommend this for advanced exercisers who like to move fast and who don't need a lot of breakdown for the moves.",1279497600,4,1115,4.302884615384615
2871602,5,B000ROA06I,"I love this step box workout! It's fun, effective, and fast paced.  There is nothing boring about this dvd.  Kelly Coffey is a great instructor and I love her personality. I am an intermediate-to-advanced cardio stepper and kick boxer and I really work up a sweat everytime.  It took maybe 3-4 times to learn the routine, but so well worth learning.  It's everything you need in a workout, cardio, weights and abs.  I highly recommend this dvd.  So much fun!",1276387200,5,458,4.6625

2871605,5,B000ROA06I,"I love this workout.  It is a high energy kickboxing workout that incorporates the step.  The only thing is that her cueing is not that great.  Other than that, I enjoy doing this workout.  One of my favorites.",1238457600,,210,4.447368421052632
8201805,5,B000ROA06I,"Was heavily involved in group fitness classes then moved with my husband for the Army to a small compound in Saudi Arabia. They have a nice gym but no classes. Kelly's DVD's have filled the gap for me and I am ordering every one she has ever made. I like her style, her instructions, and I am getting results. She is not too bubbly and not too stern. Just right!",1519948800,,362,4.185714285714286

8201807,4,B000ROA06I,"I was looking for a new workout DVD and I happened across this.  I like both kickboxing and step workouts so I thought it would be perfect for me.  I do like it overall, although I have a few issues with it.

First off, though, the good points: this is an effective workout.  It is difficult but not impossible to complete (I'd consider myself at an intermediate/advanced fitness level).  So I was challenged, which is what you want from a workout, of course.

It is more ""step"" than ""boxing.""  Although there are some punches, kicks, etc. thrown in as part of the step routine, there are not nearly as many as you would expect from a typical kickboxing workout.  The step is utilized much more often.  This is not a bad thing, per se, I just wanted you to be aware of the ratio of step to boxing if you are considering a purchase.  I find step workouts to be good cardio, so I don't mind.

The music is OK but not great.  The set is not distracting.  The instructor is fit and generally friendly and the two demonstrators behind her know the routine very well (no flailing around like some of the participants in old Tae Bo videos...).  Production values are definitely acceptable, though not flashy.  Use of each side of the body is balanced.

The moves are generally high impact.  You don't *have* to jump every time if you don't want to, but you certainly could (you could also increase your step height to increase the intensity).  The pace *is* quite fast.  I was able to keep up (with some exceptions, mostly relating to choreography) and there was absolutely no time to get bored.

What I do not like: the choreography is not always easy to follow.  I have done dozens of choreographed workouts in the past -- everything from Kathy Smith and Denise Austin VHS tapes from the 90s to more updated DVDs from The Firm.  A feature of those is a buildup of moves from simpler to more complex, until you can do the whole routine.  And I never had any trouble following those.  But there are a couple of sequences here that I literally *never* managed to do right even once.  Others I only caught on to at the very end.  And some, I did get right the first time.  But the difficulty level is not even or consistent.  Sometimes a trickier move just needed to be broken down a little more, or perhaps a little more explanation would have done the trick.  At any rate, I was still working hard because I was the one flailing around, attempting to follow the routine at these points.  I may be able to figure these out after doing the workout a few more times.  We will see.

Also, although I did watch the introduction, but there is not enough information given about equipment.  There is a weights section near the end and you are never told what weights to use.  I tried it with 5 lb dumbbells and that was OK for me (probably could have gone up to 8).

Finally, there are no water breaks.  The actual workout is about 52 minutes.  A lot of DVDs will have built in pauses between segments, or actual stops for water.  This one did not.  I had to fumble around to find the DVD remote and pause it so I could get a drink.  (There's also not adequate time to set up the mat for the abs section at the end and to get the step out of the way.)

There's a weights section at the end and I do like it.  It uses compound movements where you are working the upper body and lower body at the same time.  The abs section that follows that is a little less inspired because it's pretty much all variations on the sit-up.

So anyway, I was able to complete the whole DVD.  I felt like I got a good workout (hence my rating and despite my issues).  I was in a lot of pain the next day (the good kind of post-workout pain), which means I was working things that needed to be worked.  So overall, I'm happy with this and will keep it in my rotation (probably about twice a week) for now.",1440547200,5,3870,4.289073305670816
8201808,5,B000ROA06I,"Just love this workout!!  It's fun, challenging and different.  I needed something new and I love step.  I also love kickboxing.  This was the perfect blend of both.  I love Kelly's enthusiasm and endless amounts of energy.  She is a very motivating instructor.  I also thought the price for this dvd was great. This is a fast paced workout and it does take a couple of times before you master it.  I wouldn't recommend this for beginners. However, If you're looking for a real motivating instructor and challenging workout I definitely recommend this workout dvd.",1438041600,,564,4.863157894736842
8201809,5,B000ROA06I,Good workout and Kelly is spot on with instruction it is faster pace but easy to follow also her cardio weights are a really good workout and she follows with ab work all in all a good workout,1413590400,,192,4.078947368421052
8201810,5,B000ROA06I,"Really nice workout.  Kelly has a non-nonsense attitude that is really refreshing.  She is just matter of fact (and encouraging!) but not over-the-top bubbly as some workout video people are.

Kelly does a good job slowly introducing more complicated variants in later iterations, so it is not too hard to follow if you pay attention.  By the third time I went through the workout, I had it all down.  The first time though will be rough.  I would recommend just going through it and slowly picking things up, rather than watching it beforehand as she and others recommend.  It is easier to learn by doing than watching.

The video has a fast pace.  You will need the stepper, some weights, and a mat.  I think the moves are high impact enough that you would benefit from having a large mat and placing the stepper on the mat.  This is what I do.

I am in my mid 40s and have had several knee operations.  I am in not too bad shape, but my knees can't take excessive pounding.  Kelly does have the woman on the right giving lower impact alternatives.  Some of the alternatives are good and some are not that great, in my opinion.

If anyone cares, this is what I recommend:

Put the stepper on a large mat.

First warmup routine:  No modification necessary.

Second routine:  No modification necessary.

Third routine:  She has a step up--jog on stepper--power--alternate thrusting legs down routine.  I replace this with a step up--power--do a repeater (just on one leg) 5 times routine.  The jogging on the nonpadded stepper is no good, and the alternating repeaters she does encourage you to slam your legs down.  It is better just to do 1 repeater on one side, and then do the other leg in the next set.  Finally, replace the jumping jacks with the alternative recommended by the person on the right.

Fourth routine:  No modification necessary.

Fifth routine:  The last iteration of this routine has her doing some scissors and other things when coming off of the stepboard at the very end.  I replace this with the knee-up/twist/boxer moves from the fourth routine.

Sixth routine and cooldown:  No modification necessary.

Strength routine:  Just be careful with the side jumping.  I still jump but only a centimeter or so above the ground (and recall that the ground is a padded mat for me) so as not to mess things up much.

Floor routine/abdomen:  No modification necessary.

It is a really nice dvd.  I think that it gives a good workout, and that if you change just a little bit here and there it won't be as high impact as other reviewers have mentioned.  I really do like her style of instruction.",1413590400,,2612,4.62582056892779
8201811,4,B000ROA06I,"This is a great workout video that'll have you sweating.  That being said, it's very challenging and not for a beginner.  I'm going to keep at it but it's very hard to follow for someone just starting out.",1403740800,,205,4.368421052631579
8201812,5,B000ROA06I,I absolutely love step aerobics and only had one DVD at home so when I saw this one I had to order it. The choreography gets kind of difficult through parts of it but overall a great workout,1393804800,,190,4.026315789473684
