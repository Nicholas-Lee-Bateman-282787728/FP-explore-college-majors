1156962,5,7883704559,"Aside from all the other well known kids movies, such as Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., and Cars, Toy Story was the only one that stood out the most to me. The concept of toys moving around and talking gives the story a whole new level of personification. Woody, the favorite toy of his owner, Andy, gets anxious when a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) comes in. Woody fears that his position of being Andys favorite toy may be jeopardized with the new toy in town. And to add on to that, Buzz is a complete airhead who thinks hes a real spaceman who needs to return to his homeland. After Andy moves houses, Buzz and Woody somehow end up in the evil clutches of Andys neighbors. Buzz and Woody must learn how to work together to get back with Andy.

  The plot had me hooked right away. I had never seen a movie about toys talking or moving around before this. The writers don't forget to include funny one-liners and some heartfelt moments, throughout the movie. I was excited to join Buzzs and Woodys journey. After watching the movie, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

  Toy Story taught me a lesson. When I was little, the only thing I got from the movie, was weird looking toys and strange, rude, people. But now that Ive rewatched it, I realized that its a lot more than that. We don't really appreciate what we have now until it gets taken from us. Woody got so caught up in his role of being Andys favorite, that when he got taken away, (by Andys neighbors) he didn't register the fact that he was luckier than all the other toys. Andy didn't love the other toys as much as he loved Woody. I recommend Toy Story to all people looking for something comical, but from the heart.",1519862400,,1677,4.37620578778135

One of those is The lion King for example was about $13. I did make the mistake of not buying that because toy story at $1.99 was  sort of a mistake. I should have bought the lion king because then I would have it forever. And you  $13. Not buying that was a waste for me. I shouldve just bought the lion King.

With a length of just 81 minutes, it almost feels experimental, but at the same time it gets to the point, which is what keeps it from being ordinary. The plot is good, and the CGI is breathtaking, especially considering the fact that CGI was an infant in 1995. I think what makes this film work is the voice acting and the music. Overall, Toy Story is very entertaining, and adults can enjoy it just as much as children.

One thing that can be spotted right away is that there is no lenticular slipcover. A disappointment, but nothing too major. The Digital Copy disc is replaced with a slip of paper containing a code for redemption on Disney Movies Anywhere. The discs are stacked on top of each other in this version, which isn't anything that bothers me a lot. The discs are exactly the same as the 2011 version, meaning that you won't miss out on anything except the 3D slipcover.

Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle.

Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel.",1484179200,,684,4.3359375

Andrews Blu-ray Review: TOY STORY [1995] heralded as the first feature length film to be produced entirely on computer generated, it's the human input that makes TOY STORY work so well. A deceptively simple story 'peopled' with charming, funny, and well-realised characters and highly enjoyable fare for anyone who ever owned a toy.

It's a lovely joke that the film's toy characters are charmingly plain, especially Etch-a-Sketch, plastic soldiers, a dog made out of a Slinky, while its behind-the-scenes technology, under the inspired direction of John Lasseter, could not be more cutting edge. It's another joke that this film begins with human characters that have the flat, inexpressive look of toys. A boy named Andy is seen playing boisterously with Woody, his favourite cowboy, whose features remain innocently blank. Only after Andy gets bored and goes elsewhere does Woody spring magically to life.

With a voice supplied wonderfully by Tom Hanks, who leads this film's stellar vocal cast, Woody is instantly sympathetic. His prime spot in Andy's good graces has made him first among equals within the toy community, and Woody enjoys the perks of his power, including the attraction it holds for a Little Bo Peep doll. ""What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?"" she inquires.

But Woody gets a surprise with the opening of Andy's birthday presents, in an extended sequence that is one of the film's wonderful major marvels. The toys stage a reconnaissance mission to the living room, led by little soldiers who hide in the leaves of a houseplant as if this were a jungle. With the help of a walkie-talkie, data on the birthday gifts is relayed back to Woody, who isn't worried by Andy's new lunch box. However, Buzz Lightyear, the boastful new astronaut who takes over Woody's place on Andy's bed, is something else again. As for the rivalry between Woody and Buzz, it too keeps the film sparkling in believable ways. When Woody starts feeling competitive with this new plastic sibling and when Andy's cowboy bedspread subtly switches to an astronaut motif, it's easy to sympathise with Woody worries.

The story goes that our toys have a life of their own when we're not looking, and they form a hierarchical community where the most-played-with are the natural leaders. Sheriff Woody [Tom Hanks] currently rules the roost and ensures the smooth operation of their owner's playtime. But an early birthday gift in the shape of Buzz Lightyear [Tim Allen] is delightful deadpan and upsets this harmony when he takes Woody's coveted place on the bedspread. Things are complicated further by Buzz's conviction that he is a real space ranger, and not a battery operated plaything.

The strong cast of TOY STORY includes Tim Allen, posturing manfully as Buzz; Wallace Shawn as a neurotic dinosaur; John  Ratzenberger as a wisecracking piggy bank; Jim Varney as the Slinky dog; R. Lee Ermey as commander of the toy soldiers, and Don Rickles  as the caustic Mr. Potato Head. Randy Newman and Lyle Lovett sing a genial duet over the closing credits, and Randy Newman wrote the film's easy-going score. Thanks to exultant wit and so many distinctive voices, TOY STORY is both an aural and visual delight.

TOY STORY is a ground-breaking CGI animation and it's the top class voices which breathe life into an intelligent and witty script. Tom Hanks plays the kind of amicable all round hero that is built upon his star persona, and of course with superb support from an array of toys such as Mr Potato Head [Don Rickles], Bo Peep [Annie Potts], and Slinky Dog [Jim Varney]. Shot through with an exuberant and enviable sense of its own brilliance, TOY STORY will continue to impress long after its technical virtuosity has been upstaged. Perhaps even ""to infinity . . .  and beyond!""

PIXAR has changed the way that people watch animated films. With TOY STORY, it was the first time a generated animated film was done completely with computer graphics. The first is epic and created the franchise loved by everyone. Woody and Buzz are some of the most notable characters from any film and has nudged it way into everyones hearts. This Blu-ray contains the converted 3D presentation of this film. Since the film was originally released in 1995. It is before this new Disney Digital 3D technology existed. The conversion is really awesome and adds amazing good great depth to the computer generated animated film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  PIXAR Animation Studios brings you an upgrade of TOY STORY in this brilliant 1080p encoded image via this 3D Blu-ray of the original film and for the first time in an all-digital transfer, as well as the equally brilliant 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Given the recent nature of the clean-up, especially from the original digital files and the results are nothing short of spectacular and, just as expected, the image quality is essentially as good as a brand new computer generated film. This TOY STORY in Disney Digital 3D Blu-ray pops out off the screen in a spectacular way with an amazing depth of field, and makes TOY STORY in Disney Digital 3D Blu-ray a truly classic demonstration material.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again PIXAR Animation Studios brings you this TOY STORY in Disney Digital 3D Blu-ray is benefited with some tweaking with their awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio ES surround sound experience. The soundtrack exhibits the kind of surround mixes that have come to be another of the excellent PIXARs trademarks. Highly detailed, exceptionally well recorded and perfectly mixed, the PIXAR Studios relationship with George Lucas continues today through the top-end tracks produced at the Lucas Skywalker Sound studio, and you can be sure those levels are well reached here and actually surpassed. Bass separation is particularly impressive, especially in the rumbling road crossing scene in the animated film, and the intricate movements of the toys have much more clarity, even if they still don't quite call attention to themselves.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: A SPECIAL SNEAK PEEK AT TOY STORY 3: THE STORY [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:05] Here we get introduced by Lee Unkrich [Director], informing us about the new TOY STORY 3 that will complete the PIXAR trilogy. It's basically a promo to get you to view the third animated film. This is part one of the Sneak Peek promo about the 'TOY STORY' 3D Blu-ray franchise, very sneaky.

Audio Commentary: View Film with Commentary by Director John Lasseter, Co-Screenwriter Andrew Stanton, Supervising Animator Pete Docter, Art Director Ralph Eggleston, Supervising Technical Director Bill Reeves and Producers Ralph Guggenheim and Bonnie Arnold: Here we get very personal introduction with this audio commentary with the people involved with producing TOY STORY and you can view this in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround. Most of the talk at the start is just general chat about how they wanted the animated film to establish all the characters and the evolvement of the storyline. When you get to around Chapter 4 at around 6:38 minutes, where Woody is talking to all the toys, well if you look behind Woody there is a row of books and on some of the spines they read Tin Toy and knick knack to name but a few and were of course the original PIXAR animated shorts and low and behold someone comments on the in-house joke. But one annoying thing is that they say so many times that this is their favourite scene in the film, how boring [yawn] and on top of all that I felt there were far too many people doing the audio commentary, as each person sounds like they are trying to outdo each other with their personal anecdotes why they love this animated film and especially the women in this group, wow she has the most obnoxious awful voice I have heard in a very long time and somehow put me off this audio commentary. Despite this, most of the Group dive into the story, script, characters, and voice performances, animation strides in computer technology, as well as computer technical challenges, and filmmaking prowess that made the film the classic that it is today. All in all everyone says that they are very proud of their work on TOY STOY and especially as it was one of the first computer animated film and of course since then things have gone from great strides in technology and computer wizardry and improving with each year that passes. So all in all this audio commentary is okay, but again there are far too many people trying to outdo each other and also sometimes they try and talk at the same time, so in future please have less people with an audio commentary, as I do not want too many people talking vacuous comments at the same time.

Special Feature: Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Blast Off [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:27] Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs is a three-part short film series based on the Toy Story animated films. This is Part One of this fantastic little feature where Buzz Lightyear talks about his time on the International Space Station with Hamm and Rex. Each short shows Buzz Lightyear telling Rex and Hamm about his trip and how he got home in time for the events via the next two Toy Story Blu-ray discs. Buzz Lightyear is a real space ranger now.

Special Feature: Paths To PIXAR: Artists [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:49] This introduces us to a number of PIXAR veterans and the personal journeys they took before landing their roles at the PIXAR Studio. Contributors include Tia W. Kratter, Bill Wise, Sherry Callahan and Ralph Ecclestone.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: John Lasseters Car [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:28] This is one of three my favourite features of this Blu-ray release of TOY STORY and is a series of bonus features called Studio Stories. Here they recount the humble death-box car the director John Lasseter of TOY STORY drove to the PIXAR studio at the time of making the animated film. Here they talk about the really old battered car John Lasseter had, that was eventually falling to bits and so out of frustration, management eventually bought John Lasseter a brand new car. This particular short film features animated re-enactments of interesting and funny stories that took place during the making of the TOY STORY animated film. Narrated by Glenn McQueen and Darla K. Anderson.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: Baby AJ [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:40] This tells the very amusingly story of AJ Riebi and the lengths he went to in order to win the Studios Halloween costume contest, which he actually won. Narrated by AJ Riebi.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: Scooter Races [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:18] Here staff at PIXAR Studio elaborates on the famous PIXAR culture of the artists zooming around the offices at speed, and the attempts to make it around the PIXAR Studio to beat the previous record time. Narrated by Pete Doctor and Andrew Stanton.

Special Feature: Buzz Takes Manhattan [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:12] John Lasseter is in reflective retrospective where he expresses his pure joy at having a Buzz Lightyear balloon in the annual Macys Thanksgiving Parade in New York City. With location footage from the parade, and John Lasseters clear enthusiasm in being both as a parade walker and in talking head mode, its hard to resist this spot of spectacle. Contributors include John Lasseter [Chief Creative Officer for PIXAR & Disney Animation] and Roger Gould [Creative Director of PIXAR Theme Parks].

Special Feature: Black Friday: The TOY STORY You Never Saw [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:36] This is the last and most substantial of these extras, and looks back at the original version of the TOY STORY film as it was guided by the Disney executives of the 1990s. It is frank, but not so to upset those involved with the production of the animated film, but there is an interesting emphasis on how the notes that the PIXAR team received didn't really do the film justice, and how things didn't really fall into place until John Lasseter and his senior team pulled the story back from the brink of disaster and worked overtime over a two week period to present Disney with a plot and characters that really worked, and we get to sample of the film reel that led to the disastrous Black Friday screening is shown, and those with the original DVD release will get a feeling of dj vu. Contributors include John Lasseter [Chief Creative Officer for PIXAR & Disney Animation], Ed Catmull [President of PIXAR & Disney Animation] Pete Docter [Director of UP], Joe Ranft [Co-Director of CARS], Thomas Schumacher [Former president of Walt Disney Animation], Pete Schneider and Andrew Stanton [Director of WALL-E].

Once upon a time I owned every Disney VHS there was, and then, well, VHS was a thing of the past (can you imagine!!!?) and my final ability to play my beloved movies broke for the umpteenth time and I just couldn't justify fixing it again. I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who hasn't seen Toy Story (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a hilariously-funny movie with quotable lines that you will remember (and use!) years down the road. But underneath the hilarity and memorability, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame.

Amazon Digital is wonderful--it's nice to have this movie there in my forever library so I can watch it whenever and wherever I wish. The process was simple--press buy and viola! It showed up in my library.",1472083200,6,949,4.543859649122807

1159916,1,7883704559,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

1159978,4,7883704559,"Arguably one of the best Pixar movies (and the first, if my memory is correct), Toy Story is a tale that will delight both children and adults. While the kids enjoy that the toys come to life, the parents can enjoy the inside jokes and play "" name that actor/actress"" with who provides the voice talent.

The only reason that the movie doesn't earn a five star is that, for more sensitive kids, there is some material in the movie that might frighten them or keep them up after watching. The cruel kid neighbor who tortures toys and Woody and Buzz getting left behind might require some explanation by the parents to more sensitive kids.",1465344000,,637,4.539130434782609

1160067,5,7883704559,"This was a wonderful Toy Story DVD set when I bought it in mid 2000.  Sure, Blu-ray 1080p versions of the movies and extras would even be better, but DVDs still hadn't been around in the mainstream but a year or two at this point.  Obviously, Blu-ray or HD-DVD were still yet to come.

This was and is an excellent set.  We still have this Ultimate collector's set.  Our youngest son loves the Toy Story franchise and still gets this set out here and there as well.  The set contains quite a bit of bonus material and extras, which was REALLY nice to see at the time because most DVDs had subtitles (maybe) as well as possibly a trailer or two.  Granted, this was an Ultimate collector's set.  So, you expect a lot more and Disney/Pixar delivered in this case.  Even the packaging was quite nice and well made.

All of that said, if I was buying a collector's set now, I would look for one of the Blu-ray or Blu-ray + DVD sets.",1464307200,,927,4.275862068965517

But now it's almost 20 years later, so I think it's fair to ask whether it can stand on its own as a drama. It cannot. I found myself wishing it was over when we were halfway through it, and I found the relationship between the two principal characters to be smarmy.

1160773,5,7883704559,"This was my daughter's first favorite movie so it will always have a place close to my heart. I still remember my little 3 year old asking to watch ""Boody and Buzz"" pretty much every single day. I still remember how mesmerized she was with the characters and the colors. This movie is already such a classic story. I love all of Pixar's movies but this one is so exceptional when you think of how new their technology was and how much they did that was so new to animated films.

The story of Woody and Buzz and the toys is so perfect and I love how there is enough of a story to keep adults entertained, especially when they are watching the same move for the 1,000th time. I love that this movie isn't marketed to just boys, but to everyone. My daughter is now 6 and while she doesn't ask to watch this every day now, she still does watch it on occasion. I love that she can now watch the story with a whole different level of understanding and how in 5 more years it will be the same and then again 5 years after that.

He fell in love with all of the characters and continued to collect them and watch this movie over and over and OVER again.
This movie is so cute.  It has such a great message which is so typical and expected from Disney of course.
Now, I have 4 kids with one on the way.  They have all absolutely loved this movie and we continue to watch it all the time!!!!

Definitely in my top 10 Disney movies of all time!!!!",1453507200,,640,4.055555555555555

I loved it as a child and now I get to share it with my son. He loves Buzz and giggles like crazy when watching the movie.  It has inspired him to want to become an astronaut which is really cute.  We are going on a Disney cruise so I am getting him used to Disney characters since there is a play area that looks like Andys room.  He is now so excited he can hardly contain himself.

This DVD box set is by far, the best of all, IF you're a fan of '90s Disney movies like I was, but you prefer to watch them in digital quality rather than on VHS. And you can, even in ""fake"" high definition, by using any typcial Blu-ray player in your household. I also strongly recommend this DVD if you love to watch bonus material, like the ones included in this set. So to sum it all up, if you're a fan of '90s (not 2000s or later) Disney, and you prefer them in any digital quality more than on VHS, AND you'd rather see the oldest bonus material over the newer ones, then this DVD box set is just for you.",1451260800,,682,4.135338345864661

1161586,5,7883704559,"Many are wondering why DisneyPIXAR is releasing a new Blu-Ray set of the Toy Story trilogy. The reason is because Toy Story is celebrating its 20th Anniversary. Another reason that I suspect is that these versions will be one disc Blu-Ray sets meaning they will be cheaper (upon release) than the current available collectors editions that are $30. Most Pixar movies never fall under $26 but with these having only one Blu-Ray disc it is possible that they may fall to $20 come the release day.
Also, Pixar is currently working on Toy Story 4 set to release in 2017. This will allow them to get these new release Blu-Rays into stores for the holidays and catch people's attention once more. Since the release of part one and twos Blu-Rays there has been a new release (Toy Story 3) so it is time to update the special features. A lot has changed in the Pixar/ Toy Story world since the first two films Blu-Ray releases.",1445644800,2,919,4.575757575757576

1162287,5,7883704559,"This is of course, a timeless classic that will always be popular. With an All-Star cast and whimsical music score, this movie is sure to capture and delight those of all ages. I loved it when it came out in 1995 (I was 11 years-old then) and now that I have kids of my own, I thought it would be great for them to see toys come to life.

I was right. My little girl (two years-old) was enamored with the movie when I put it on for her. She was so engrossed with the characters and she loved the music. It is now one of her top favorites.

I think this is a great movie for all ages and will provide years of entertainment so it is definitely a good investment. As an adult, I still found entertainment value in it and found myself stopping and getting caught up watching the intense story line. Will Woody and the Toys be able to save Buzz from the bad seed that lives next door to their child, Andy?

Even though I know how the story will end, I can't help but stand there and watch. A must buy for any Disney/Pixar fans.",1436400000,,1023,4.079601990049751

One scene is a little scary for very little ones but the 5-year old granddaughter handled it well.  These animated characters are as real to watch as any live action movie.  I highly recommend it.

1162754,5,7883704559,"Over ten years ago during a Holloween trick or treat session my autistic son first saw this movie over the shoulder of a mother who was dispensing candy, he quietly finessed his way into her living room and watched it for at least 15 minutes before I was forced to return him to reality and schedules. He still struggles trying to learn to communicate and still loves this movie.

It teaches the lessons of childhood that if not learned become really bad for all the adults around the grown up who does not get them. Maybe if Obama on the invite to Paris, Ted Cruz on the floor of the senate, ISIS wherever they happen to be, Hillary when deciding how to setup her emails, or Christi when picking his traffic staff, Maliki when working with his generals, and numerous others had learned them we all might be better off. Make sure your kids do not miss this and oh yes adults can generally use a 10 year review, sometime more often. m Pax Vobiscum hlaw",1428278400,2,951,4.403409090909091

""No matter how many times I watch Toy Story, I love it more and more each time. The characters are like my friends. I wonder what it would be like to have a real toy as your best friend. The movie has lots of different emotions in each scene. Each time I get a new character, I think of what I'm going to play next.

I recommend this movie because you really understand what the characters are feeling. If you haven't seen this movie, I would recommend you watch it immediately.

Each time I pick up the remote I think of watching Toy Story. I would recommend this for anyone who has a good side and an imagination.""",1422316800,,710,4.1678832116788325

1163394,4,7883704559,"First off, my 2 year old son LOVES the Toy Story movies! I love watching them with him. Honestly, I end up watching him more than the movie itself. I cherish his excitement and how intently he watches. We watch them over and over, along with a few others to add some variety, AKA sanity for me. I purchased the HD version, not because it makes a difference to him now but since it was available and I'll have it forever I figured I may as well spend the extra 5 bucks on it.

Amazon thoughtfully provides a disclaimer to inform you that you may or may not receive the download in HD, all depending on your internet speed. This disclaimer is prior to purchase and after confirmation the download begins. I was not concerned with this as I always have a very good speed and service with never a downloading issue. Unfortunately, it did not download in HD. I can say that I was fairly warned by the disclaimer, my only complaint is that it would be nice for Amazon to refund the extra money paid for HD when it was not in fact not a HD download.

I am fairly new to the digital movie downloads. So I guess there is a possibility that sometimes it will be viewed in HD also, depending on the internet? Anyway you look at it though, it makes my son happy so it makes me happy!",1419811200,,1271,4.204918032786885

I played it for my sick 2 year old and he seemed to like it although I think he will like it so much more when he's a little older. I have heard from other parents the neighbor kid could be kind of scary for little ones. I advise that all parents preview a movie before showing it to your little ones under 4. All kids are different and no one knows them better than you. The neighbor didn't even phase my 2 year old but I still thought I should mention it. Enjoy!",1410393600,,619,4.081967213114754

1164052,5,7883704559,This movie is more than an animation for kids. It was very entertaining for adults too. The story line was brilliant - Woody's reputation was challenged by a new comer. His bad intensions (that's outside of his character) made him make a bigger mistake - now Buzz is in real DANGER. But in Woody's remorse - the adventure to rescue his one time rival is now his friend. If only a toy can talk. Lol!!,1406419200,,399,4.333333333333333
1164111,5,7883704559,This was my favorite movie when I was little. As a kid I loved the comedic bickering between Buzz and Woody. As an adult I like the more mature references. One such reference is when Mr. Potato head putting his lips to but in response to Slinky complimenting Woody. Another one is when Woody twists his head in a complete circle like in the Exorcist when escaping from Sid's yard. It is a timeless classic that everyone will enjoy.,1406419200,,431,4.468354430379747

It's funny, has great characters and has a nostalgic sentimental feel to it. The animation is still impressive, but it is obvious that we've come a long way with CGI especially when it comes to hair and textures.

The Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic! I'm mean really, it is like watching the film for the first time seeing it in HD, but while there are a lot of bonus features ported over and some new ones to BR, I was extremely disappointed that the short Tin Toy was not carried over! It's like everything else from the original is here except for that great little short.

I own the 3 disc Toy Story 1 & 2 DVD set and there is an entire disc of material that isn't here either. If you want to watch the film looking it best the Blu Ray os the way to go, but if you want bonus material stick to the 3 disc DVD set as the extras missing are really special.",1396137600,2,1019,4.1938775510204085

Children and their parents (and even adults without children) are in love with these films, and its easy to see why.  They are clever, exciting, original and they build such strong emotional ties to the audience, delivering a beautifully moving cinematic experience.  Everyone is familiar with the story at this point, so Ill spare you a huge plot breakdown, but know that you won't regret getting to know Woody and Buzz (not to mention the rest of their crew), and the impact theyll have on you cinematic life is huge.  Youll fall in love, which is why parents and children were bawling their eyes out at the end of Toy Story 3.  With crisp animation, superb character development and a plot that stirs deeply profound emotions (this look at childhood, innocence and friendship is remarkably astute), Toy Story may be almost twenty years old, but it is just as profound, poignant and lovable today as it was upon its release!",1391644800,2,1023,4.724719101123595

The packaging is what I expected, I'm not really into all the fancy collectible stuff anyways. The disks were in perfect shape...What the heck is the thing with the industry calling the version you can install on a device a ""Digital Copy""?

Now my sisters both have toddler girls (3 and 2 y.o.).  This movie is the girls's favorite and that pleases us because we enjoy it as much as they do.  So if we need to watch it 3 to 4 times a week - Que Sera Sera.

Our favorite characters are of course Woody and Buzz Lightyear. And from the other Toy Story movies - Jessie is mine and my niece's all time favorite Toy Story character.
We just recently went to Disneyland (in California) and went on It's A Small World with the girls of course.  Now it's been a few years since I've been to the park and it was my nieces's first time.  So you could imagine our surprise to see Disney characters on a lot of the rides now.  It's a Small World had the most newly added Disney characters.  And Woody, Jessie and Bullseye are some of the new additions to that ride.  My nieces were thrilled to see them there.  Us grown ups kind of rolled our eyes.",1377734400,,1061,4.131707317073171

1165133,2,7883704559,"I avoided this film for nearly 2 decades. The marketing storm that surrounded the original and subsequent releases was a major turnoff for me, but I finally caved.

It was pretty much what I expected - a feature length commercial. It was as though Disney/Pixar had literally run out of ideas for a film, but needed to offload some action figures they already had sitting around. Solution? An animated film built around those action figures.

The only real surprise came roughly 20 minutes in, when a child strapped a firecracker to one of the sentient toy soldiers, and blew him up. I've got to give it to Pixar for that detail - I didn't ever expect to see a suicide bombing in a children's film. Well done?

1165528,5,7883704559,"I remember when Toy Story originally came. It was a game changer at the time. No one else did anything like it. The graphics, the animation, the detail. Everything looked so real. I couldn't believe that I was watching a cartoon. Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, and the entire cast provide some of the greatest voices to the classic movie. I think I have purchased Toy Story on every medium that it's been on. I still have the VHS copy, I have multiple versions of the DVD. When I saw that there was a digital copy of it, I knew I had to have it.

The digital copy offers two versions. You may get it through iTunes or you may get a copy to watch in Windows Media Player. I chose to have my copy go through iTunes. This means that I can watch the movie on any of my ""i"" devices including my iPhone, iPad, and AppleTV. I love that I can play it on my AppleTV. It makes the watching experience so much easier. I don't have to worry about getting a disc out, loading it in the player, and possibly scratching it. It's always ready for me to watch whenever I want.

The quality of the digital copy is excellent. It looks like it is somewhere between DVD and Blu-ray quality. I highly recommend getting a digital copy and choosing the iTunes version if you have the means to do so. It can go on any ""i"" device and it travels easily.

Indeed, The three movies should be seen one after the other in the order they were made.  Viewed this way they make the best trilogy of movies ever made in Hollywood-with the possible exception of The Lord of the Rings set.  I rate all three toy story  movies as five star, the highest rating possible.  However, each movie in the trilogy builds upon the preceeding movie(or movies).  The characters in these movies ""grow"" in each installment-which makes it an emotional and delightfultrilogy to watch.  I recommend all three of the films for all children and grown-ups to watch-and love.",1361145600,,701,4.791666666666667
1165678,5,7883704559,"I have the trilogy, and it was wonderful, but the beginning, when Buzz and Woody first meet brought us into the world of toys and their down to earth concerns of being replaced by something ""better"" and then forgotten about or sold away or thrown away. Woody has been Andy's top toy for some time, but soon finds his top spot usurped by a new Space toy named Buzz Lightyear. In an act of jealousy, he arranges a plot to hide Buzz from sight, but to his horror it gets out of hand when Buzz falls out of the window and Woody is accused of trying to terminate Buzz. In an attempt to get him back, Woody has to reconcile his own feelings all while dealing with Buzz's delusion that he is a real Space Ranger on a mission. It ends in the house of the nortorious Sid, a kid with an obsession for fireworks--and destroying toys. Buzz and Woody then must work together to befriend the toys in Sid's house to help free them from Sid's tyranny and escape Sid's house before Andy's family moves away. It is a straightforward story with a great script and wonderful acting between Tom Hanks as Woody, and Tim Allen as Buzz. Well worth watching time and time again.",1360713600,,1153,4.342592592592593

1165754,5,7883704559,"Sort of the 'Snow White' of Pixar, if you like.

'Toy Story' made history by being the first fully computer-animated motion picture ever produced. That in and of itself would have been impressive, but it's also a great movie. When a pull-string cowboy doll meets a delusional spaceman action figure, sparks are sure to fly. But can these two unlikely friends stop bickering long enough to avoid being left behind when their young owner moves away?

(Not bad, huh? I should write blurbs like this for a living!)

We've all heard or read or seen dozens of stories about toys coming to life when their owners leave the room, from the beloved 'Velveteen Rabbit' to the tragically underrated Jim Henson special 'The Christmas Toy.' But never before has that concept seemed so...well, REAL, for want of a better word. The animation looks a little dated today (compare to the sequel and see how far the technology came in just four years) but the storytelling and performances are still wonderful as are the songs written by music legend Randy Newman.

The Digital Copy is in SD, and poor SD at that.  It's made to be small and only take 1 GB of space on your phone/tablet. I haven't confirmed this version, but I've read some Digital Copies audio is actually duplicated mono to both the Left and Right channels so people wearing one earbud will hear all the sound.  I recommend using Handbrake to *coughRIP* your DVD movie onto your device if space is less an issue.

If you are running iTunes sharing in your home, you could even put the full *coughRIP* DVD movie on your computer/iTunes server to stream higher quality SD to your tablets/devices.",1358985600,,822,4.368421052631579

1165764,3,7883704559,"I finally watched this with my two young children, and was surprised at certain parts.  The movie is fine, it has that fever pitch that is quite anxiety producing for children, rather than just exciting.  Woody certainly does far more name calling (""idiot! stupid!"") than I think is necessary.  Bo Peep is one of the only female characters in this film, and though she's helpful and thoughtful, she's also really interested in romancing Woody, a typical sexualization of a minor female character.  My kids also wanted to know WHY the neighbor kid was so awful (his sister isn't).  It's unfortunate that he doesn't come to recognize any feelings or have any consequences/conclusions that resolve his behavior- rather he's scared out of his 'bad ways'.  Certainly there are some lessons here that are valuable- not judging a book by its cover (as with the cobbled together toys) as well as showing that you may end up being friends with people you'd never expect, and that friendships can be complicated (and luckily if you yell at them and call them names, they still can forgive you).  To see toys that kids may recognize (like Little People) was fun for the kids, but otherwise I don't think it's a movie that they or I will really wish to see again and again.",1358121600,3,1261,4.730593607305936

The story line with the vicious neighbor boy (spoiler alert?) was really disturbing.  His mutilated toys were frightening and he creeped us all out.  Especially in this day and age, his love of blowing things up seems like a horrible element to have in a kid's movie.  I don't understand why the makers of this series include such a dark streak in each story line.  I wish I hadn't shown it to my son.  Other than that, there was some funny stuff but the way the other toys treat Woody when they think he ""killed"" Buzz is harsh too - they abandon him to that kid who mutilates toys.  There is also a bit of sexuality in the way Bo Peep tries to seduce Woody.  And frankly, there are NO other female characters in this one.  It's hard to believe, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.",1357689600,3,952,4.119565217391305
1165823,5,7883704559,"My biggest problem with watching ""Toy Story"" is that it makes me think of the impossibly better ""Toy Story 3."" As a result, I think about how I felt during ""Toy Story 3."" And I remember that ""Toy Story 3"" is unabashed in its attempt to turn each viewer into a sentimental blob of saline.

Thus?

I shift you not: I cried at 2:45 on this movie.

Yes. Not even three full minutes into the movie, and I poured my soul out. My girlfriend gave me tissues, while my roommate came out of her room to make sure everything was okay.

Obviously, I have a lot of issues with growing up and the concepts of maturity. ""Toy Story 3"" is the ostensible conclusion to Andy's coming of age. And to a large extent, his transformation occurs nearly simultaneous with mine.

Yes. I'm 26, and Andy is turning 18 and going to college. But as a coddled manchild for the good part of my early-20s, I laid in a sort of developmental hibernation that stunted my ability to progress beyond that very same threshold that Andy walked through and drove away from when he left his toys on Bonnie's lawn.

Jesus. I am at work now, and I don't know if I can keep it together. The immensity of my adulthood weighs down on me, pulling me to reality when all I can think about are cartoon clouds perfectly patterned across the walls of my room, a chest of toys waiting for me in the corner to ignite my imagination and take me away from the horrors of mediocrity.

Amazon Digitial service is almost Perfect.

I have lived in the 5.1 surround sound world for over 12 years now.
It is not my system, but instead either lack-there-of 5.1 surround, or a failure to communicate the necessary items needed to achieve 5.1 surround (e.g. can only be heard in 5.1 surround when using the following hardware etc..)

I was wrong.

It's a lovely heartfelt movie about accepting change and coming together with the people you find yourself with.  Also, it has a Joss Whedon co-written script and a heavy dose of humor for kids and grown ups alike.",1353888000,,465,4.310344827586207

This movie needs no introduction. It is a classic movie good for all ages. You are never too old to watch it.

Playing the movie:
Playing the movie on instant play was unfortunately, not as flawless as I had hopped. I was in a car driving back from a road trip. I had a MiFi (gives an internet signal just like a phone hotspot except it is it's own device)but IO did not have that much data left. I thought I would buy it and download it to my Kindle Fire with the MiFi and then watch offline (which you can do with the KF). Unfortunately, this is not the case. You need an internet connection to get it started (first few minutes) even though I shouldn't have. I figured out why: Although it is downloaded to the device, you have to trick the computer into thinking you are on WiFi just because...why shouldn't Amazon make it more difficult for us?

Even with this whole review about the playing experience, the product still gets 5/5 because this is an issue with AIV (Amazon Instant Video) and the movie remained great.",1349740800,,1040,4.383419689119171

1166241,5,7883704559,"This is a fabulous movie. It has everything going for it, a great storyline, great acting, great animation! I decided to replace our VHS with a DVD and am very glad that I spent a little extra for this 2010 Special Edition re-issue of this 1995 classic.

When you go to the Bonus Features Menu, the Commentary track is listed as the second extra, but I'm going to cover it first. I've listened to a lot of Audio Commentary tracks (you watch the movie, and they are commenting while the movie is in progress about what's happening) and I really enjoyed this one. Participants in the commentary: John Lasseter (director and co-writer), Andrew Stanton (co-writer), Pete Doctor (supervising animator), Ralph Eggleston (art director), Bill Reeves (supervising technical director), Bonnie Arnold (co-producer), Ralph Guggenheim (co-producer).

The first thing they talked about, because it's the introduction that sets the stage for the whole movie, is the beginning song by Randy Newman, ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". As Bonnie says, the movie's ""songs actually told about an emotional moment in the film, [rather than] the character singing about those things."" It's a shortcut, and very effective, for giving the audience all the background it needs to understand what happens when Buzz Lightyear interlopes.

The movie has a mix of real-life toys and made-up toys.  For the real-life toys, they had to receive permission to use them in the movie. As one man said, ""The hours I spent on the phone with Mr. Potato Head's lawyer, just trying to work out the use of Mr. Potato Head in our movie.""  It was no small thing for the image-conscious manufacturer. When we first meet Sid, the toy torturer next door, he is about to blow up a Combat Carl infantryman. They had really wanted to use G.I. Joe, but Hasbro refused the rights to use Joe if they were going to blow him up.

And speaking of soldiers, I think we all love the green plastic soldiers, marching while attached to their little stands. And we are so wrapped up in the movie that we can, as a commenter says, ""suspend disbelief"" so far that it seems logical that the sergeant can actually see through his green plastic binoculars.

Remember when they're trying to rescue Buzz by using a ladder made from the ""Barrel of Monkies"" game?  The line ""We need more monkies!"" always cracks me up. And they started using it around the studio. When they needed another person for a job it was ""We need more monkies!""

Lastly, you may have to listen to the commentary to answer these questions:
What is ""The Big Cheat""?
Where do you need to know Morse Code?
Can you catch all the homages made to the creators' favorite movies?

Here are the Bonus Features on the DVD disc of this great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-in-Blu-ray-Packaging/dp/B0030IIYWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>:

1.  ""Toy Story3: Sneak Peek"" (2:02 minutes) This is a preview-like short where ""Toy Story 3"" director, Lee Unkrich, gives us a peek for the then-forthcoming 3rd movie. TS3 was released in Nov. 2010, while the Special Editions of 1 & 2 were released in March 2010.
2.  Audio Commentary
3.  ""Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Episode 1: Blast Off"" (3:27) This is a great little introduction to the space shuttle and space station, with lots of real on-location footage provided by NASA. It looks like a Buzz Lightyear figure actually made it into space on the Discovery!
4.  ""Paths to Pixar - Artists"" (4:49) Four people tell how they got to Pixar and where they worked on ""Toy Story"". Tia Crater tells, ""When I started I had a business card that said 'Tia Crater - Imperfectionist'. Because it was my job to mess up everything that was created so perfectly in the films"". In other words, smooth hair to be messed, etc.
5.  ""Studio Stories: John's Car"" (1:27) The three studio stories are great. They are like storyboard clip reels with cute simple graphics. This first one is about director John Lasseter's car, called the ""death box car"" - over 500,000 miles and looked every inch of those miles. Narrated by Glen McQueen and Darla K. Anderson.
6.  ""Studio Stories: Baby AJ"" (1:38) Narrated by A.J. Rieble. A J tells how he won the Halloween costume contest one year. Truly above and beyond the call of duty!
7.  ""Studio Stories: Scooter Races"" (2:16) In 1991, Pixar was a small company and they'd just moved into a big building that had lots of empty space. They started riding motorized scooters for fun and then they started racing. And then the racing got very fierce. Very funny short, narrated by Pete Doctor and Andrew Stanton.
8.  ""Buzz Takes Manhattan"" (2:13) In 2008, Buzz Lightyear was a giant balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. It was a dream come true for John Lasseter, who by this time was the Chief Creative Officer for Pixar & Disney Animation. Lasseter and Roger Gould (now Creative Director for Pixar Theme Parks) star in these movie clips about raising and pulling the balloon. As Lasseter says, ""He was MEANT to be a balloon, cause he was FLYING!""
9.  ""Black Friday: The Toy Story You never Saw"" (7:36) This extra makes the Special Edition totally worth it. Wow. This is the very beginning, where Pixar was storyboarding ""Toy Story"", to be the very first full-length future done 100% on the computer. Everything had to go through Disney. Disney kept wanting multiple changes, and, in particular, Jeffrey Katzenberg ""would rip them apart"". He wanted the story more edgy, more cynical and more adult.
John Lasseter explains how the Pixar crew finally went down to Disney with about half the movie storyboarded into a movie with voice acting (though not by the actors who would be hired to do the final film)- the way they thought Disney wanted it. The character of Woody took the brunt of the rewrite, becoming unappealing and even mean. Lassiter cringes and covers his face in his hands as he introduces part of the reel that was showed Disney on what they dubbed ""Black Friday"". You will not believe it when you see it. It is mean-spirited and something you might see on [adult swim], but not a Pixar-Disney movie. Pixar hated it, and so did Disney.
Disney tried to shut them down, but Lasseter pleaded for two weeks reprieve while they reworked the story. In two weeks, in a giant collective of brains and enthusiasm, PIxar totally redid ""Toy Story"" the way they wanted it, and came up with the start of the movie that we now know and love.
Commenters in this short include these people, showing their current titles, not their titles as they worked on ""Toy Story"": John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer for Pixar & Disney Animation) , Ed Catmull (President of Pixar & Disney Animation), Pete Doctor (director ""Up""), Joe Ranft (co-director ""Cars""), Thomas Schumacher (former President Walt Disney Animation), Andrew Stanton (director ""Wall-E"").
10. ""Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go"" (1:00) This is an ad for digital files of Disney movies.

Great extras for a movie that is timeless.

This Special Edition for ""Toy Story"" came out the same time as the Special Edition for ""Toy Story 2"".

Many of the Bonus extras on the TS2 issue compliment the extras on ""Toy Story"". For example, there are three different Studio Stories, Episode 2 of Buzz's Mission Log, and a ""Paths to Pixar"" that covers the technical artists. Highly recommended!

1166289,5,7883704559,"Here's another one I've heard so very much about, but had not seen until today. I think my sides are sprained from laughing so hard! Tom Hanks is exactly the right voice for Woody, the cowboy who seems terribly out of date when Andy (their human) gets a Buzz Lightyear (voice by Tim Allen). Of course, as all kids know, the toys come to life and can move and talk when the humans are out of the room. We've known that at least since ""A Little Princess"", right?

Anyway, the big hassle is Woody has been Andy's favorite for so long that it comes as quite a shock when Buzz shows up, and suddenly the pictures on the corkboard, the bedspread and all the energy of the room is about space, not about westerns. Buzz has become Andy's favorite. Woody feels heartbroken.

But there's another problem: Andy and his family are moving, and there's a great deal of anxiety that one or more toys might be left behind. They all have moving buddies, who are supposed to look out for one another and assure that they are properly packed for the move.

The boy next door, Sid, is a little monster. And he makes monsters out of his toys and also his sister's toys. He blows up the toy soldiers, replaces his sister's doll's head with a dinosaur head, and generally has no respect for toys. Due to a thoroughly crazy set of circumstances, Woody and Buzz fall into his evil clutches. How they work together to escape, and to follow the moving van carrying Andy's toys to their new home, is controlled mayhem so intricate and so funny that I won't spoil a thing for you. Lots of action for the kids, lots of inside jokes for the grown-ups, and everyone can split their sides laughing.",1336953600,,1665,4.416938110749186

1166322,3,7883704559,"This video was for my daughter, but the way things are, my wife and I have watched it with her several times.  I get a little tired of the Pixar formula - similar Randy Newman music, lots of the same voices, similar chase scenes, but these Pixar films are good solid kids entertainment.  Pixar also weaves content into films to promote other Pixar films - the often repeated line from this movie (""To infinity and beyond!"") also makes its way into the blooper reel on ""Its a Bug's Life"", and ""Monsters Inc"" shamelessly hawks Pixar toys (the fish, woody, and others).

My biggest negative on this film is that it is more of a boy's movie than a movie for my daughter.  All the main characters are boys and the only memorable female role is Bo Peep who is trying to seduce Woody and at one point leaves lipstick kisses all over his face (not exactly a role model I'd like my daughter to emulate).",1333152000,,894,4.4

They can be frightened by some of it, so make sure they are old enough to handle it (closer to 5 than 2, for example). Otherwise, a great film!",1331164800,2,301,4.033333333333333

Woody was Andy's favorite toy until Buzz came along and begins a hostile relationship with him resulting in getting lost as a gas station.  A really bad boy next store who doesn't seem to know how to take care of toys and his mother lets him use matches unsupervised seems a particular menace.  How will Woody and Buzz Lightyear get back to nice boy Andy?  Wonderful movie with good insight into American suburban kids and families.",1326326400,,608,4.592592592592593

1166354,5,7883704559,"Where do I begin with Toy Story? I can't imagine anyone having not seen this movie in by the year of 2011, but if you haven't, BUY IT! Yes, I grew up with this movie on VHS back when it was the only Pixar movie, but that's not what makes it great. Nostalgia aside, this is still an excellent movie! The script is so clever and heartfelt, the characters are all fantastic, the voice acting is great, and the animation, which was a benchmark for its time, still holds up (even though they've come a long way). Best of all, this movie will remind adults of the joy of being a kid and playing with toys (and imagining that they were alive). This movie is a classic (the sequels are also fantastic, but definitely watch in chronological order). It might actually be my favorite movie of all time.

As for this DVD, it is great. This is the best the film has ever looked (other than the Blu-Ray, that is). The picture was taken right from the digital source at Pixar. The bonus features are fascinating (especially for aspiring animators/filmmakers like myself). My favorites are the documentary about the making of Toy Story as well as the one where John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and the late Joe Ranft (RIP) talk about the journey of making Toy Story (the first full length computer-animated film). So if you don't have a Blu-Ray player, this is still a great option.",1323388800,,1377,4.530120481927711
1166355,5,7883704559,"This is one of those movies where I knew that the story line provided for such a relate-able story and experience in life. Not to mention, that the set ups for the sequels were just plain awesome! Adding new toys along the way, etc. All great! Not to mention the time and effort that Disney and Pixar put into getting the characters right.

Pros: See above.

Cons: Nothing with the story or the animation. Would love to see these movies be able to be streamed for free after you buy them, not if you buy a specific pack. Just my 2 cents.

Recommendations: A digital copy of the music included in every blu-ray/dvd pack.",1323216000,,619,4.412280701754386

1166395,5,7883704559,"I am probably the single worst person on this Earth to write an unbiased Toy Story review.  I was really the perfect age for the Toy Story films, they were in a lot of ways my big cultural touchstones growing up.  To see Toy Story again after so many years is in a lot of ways a nostalgia trip and a remembrance to my childhood.  The film is a landmark in the animation field, the first feature-length digital animation ever made.  It is a technical masterpiece, and a guiding light to the modern era.  In a lot of ways, its also very deep.  Toy Story has always been a series about MORTALITY, and coming to grips with, well, death.  Most children's films skirt this subject entirely, but Toy Story really tackles it head on.  Buzz Lightyear has to come to grips with the fact that he is a toy, showing all of us children that we must find a place in the world.  In addition, it teaches us friendship, to respect people who are different (the misfit toys), and the pitfalls of jealousy.  I cannot describe what this film means to me, in so many ways it defined the person I am today and the morals I have.  Watching it now some of the animation is bizarre (especially the dog), but that can easily be overlooked by the shear quality of the performances and depth of the story.  It is probably one of Pixar's greatest films and continues to be a favorite of children today.  But to talk about just the first Toy Story is to undermine its cultural importance, because as a trilogy it is designed to turn my generation, the kids who grew up with Toy Story, into jelly.  The last 15 minutes of Toy Story 3 made me cry like a baby, and I am not ashamed to admit that.  As cultural icons, the characters of Toy Story live on, and Pixar's work will be forever judged to the Toy Story series.  They are remarkable films and tremendously moving.
Thank you, Pixar.",1322352000,4,1854,4.3304347826086955

1166443,5,7883704559,"Along just the regular DVD picture quality and colors from Component video, the voice talents are probably the one thing I enjoy the most about these movies! they are all outstanding! along with the music too.

Toy Story: My wife's favorite just because you get introduced to all the characters. the competition between woody and buzz turns into the life long friendship between a cowboy and spaceman. The plot is fun. New toy is unwelcome for Woody but is excepted by everyone else then becomes andy's new favorite toy.

Toy Story 2: my favorite because of one scene; When both Buzzes and all the toys try getting woody off the elevator and Zurg shows up ready to fight the ""new"" buzz with the special belt, the face on the other Buzzes face is priceless. This is a good plot, Woody gets stolen by a collector to be sold to a museum in Japan basically. Great movie.

Toy Story 3: The best plot because the Toys have to venture out into the unknown due to Andy going to college and they all think he was throwing them all away. they're sent to a prison daycare. This movie is a real tear jerker due to the ending. Pretty sad but a great movie!

All great movies all highly recommended to any family wanting fun movies:)",1315699200,,1219,4.452914798206278

1166446,5,7883704559,"Computer animation has grown so rapidly in the last years that it's easy to forget which movie was responsible for this boom in the field. Toy Story, much like Snow White before it opened a whole new world of opportunities for animation all around the world. Nowadays, most studios has their own Animation Department that mainly produces computer animated films. Being the forefather computer animated movies makes this movie important but what makes it a true masterpiece is that after all this years and countless of other animated films, Toy Story still holds up pretty well and is still one of the best animated films of all time.

Most of you must be familiar with the story so I will write a very short synopsis: Woody, a cowboy doll has been Andy's favorite since forever. He is not only the favorite toy but also the leader of all the toys in Andy's room. Everyone looks up to him and he is both respected and admired. When Andy's birthday comes, his mom gives him a new cool toy: Buzz Lightyear a space ranger who is the greatest toy ever. Buzz does not realize he is a toy but truly believes he is a space ranger. With the new toy in the room, Woody feels neglected and does something that he later regrets. He and Buzz end in a sadistic kid's house named Sid and both will have to trust each other in order to return safely to Andy's room.

Toy Story is such a pleasure to watch because it has an accesible interesting story and great characters. Woody and Buzz are excellent characters playing opposites and the rest of the toys are hilarious. John Lasseter & Co. truly created a special film. It amazes me that all the jokes are still funny and the movie does not feel dated at all. This is a true classic.

Video & Audio:
Toy Story comes to BD looking absolutely flawless. The HD transfer is inmaculate, detail is crisp and contrast is amazing. Colors are well reproduced and you can spot a lot of things that were impossible to see on SD. The HD also brings some limits in the animation and some of it does look dated (for example Scud, Sid's dog) but I think that's part of the charm of the film. A spectacular transfer.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also amazing with no signs of compression or other anomalies; it's also very strong and dynamic.

Bonus Features:
New to the BD are some goodies: ""Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Blast Off"", a NASA educating program featuring Buzz, Hamm and Rex. ""Paths to Pixar: Artists"" an excellent featurette featuring Pixar's animators and how they started at Pixar. Then you have three studio stories that give great insight of how Pixar is with anecdotes and jokes. ""Buzz takes Manhattan"" features the Buzz ballon in the Thanksgiving Macy's parade. ""Black Friday: The Toy Story You Never Saw"" is an excellent piece where the filmmakers reflect on the original concept and how bad it was. I think we are all glad they scrap that story.

After that you hev carry overs from previous releases: an audio commentary, a making of featurette, and many short featurettes that deals with the legacy of the film, the design, the story, the production and more. A gallery and trailers close up the disc.

A DVD copy is also included.

Closing Thoughts:
Toy Story is very important in the animation world but it's also still relevant, hilarious, heartfelt and a true masterpiece. This BD features truly amazing video & audio and a lot of bonus material as such comes with THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!",1314316800,,3435,4.610474631751227

I can't undersell the ingenuity of the filmmaking either, as Pixar does more with limited technology and a thin rule book than most CGI artists can manage today. Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story.",1311465600,,802,4.576388888888889

Toy Story especially shows the results of its audacity in pushing computer animation well beyond what was then its comfort zone, and one does think at times that the mature techniques of traditional animation might have served the story and the characters better.

Even so, something had to push computer animation forward, and Toy Story did it with flags flying. The characters and the story elevated what could have been a clumsy and disagreeable experiment into something that, despite certain deficiencies in the animation process, was little short of sublime. Had this not happened we wouldn't have had Toy Story 2, which picked up where Toy Story left off and not only did its predecessor proud on all fronts but still stands today as one of Pixar's greatest achievements.",1288569600,,909,4.9411764705882355

I started losing track after I counted 1,426...not counting the times I got lost and had to navigate my way out.

They have managed to avoid all the heartbreak of editing  on this disc. There are numerous unnecessary and repetitive sub-menus. How about a shot of a cardboard stand-up figure of a main character? Then how about a shot of it's blank backside? Get the picture?

I've never seen the Toy Story movies.  First awesome thing about this movie was the price: $30 for this movie AND Toy Story 2 on Blu.

The movie itself is pure gold and I have no idea how I missed out on watching this.  Having went so long before watching it, the best part for me was guessing the voice actors - John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and the greatest drill sergeant ever, R. Lee Ermey amongst others.  I think there's a little Sid (sp?) in all of us men when we were young...come on who didn't want to blow up something of ours at one time or another?  If you ever wondered what your toys were up to when you weren't looking...well your questions will be answered and then some.  The mangled toys were definitely creepy but cute in their own weird way, especially when saving the day for Andy's toys.  The picture quality is crystal clear and if you have an optimum Hi-Def setup, the sights and sounds are breathtaking.  The ending skate chase in particular is reference material for the ages.

As an added bonus, registering this Blu-ray (and Toy Story 2 on Blu) with Disney rewards netted me 2 tickets for Toy Story 3 which was icing on the cake.  I easily recommend this movie if you're the last person on this planet who hasn't seen it.",1278979200,,1527,5.191836734693878

1166786,5,7883704559,"Toy Story is one hour and twenty minutes and was released in theaters on November 22, 1995. Basically it is a story between an old toy versus a new toy. Woody is an old fashion pull string cowboy toy that is Andy's favorite toy. Woody is the leader of all of the other toys in Andy's room. The film opens on Andy's birthday and Woody sends Sarge and the Bucket 'O' Soldiers on a reconnaissance mission to spy on the birthday party so the other toys can calm down. They go through the whole stack presents and they come down to the last one that Andy's mom hid in a closet. Sarge is unable to see what it is due to the kids gathering around it. The kids and Andy head to his room to play, but in a few moments later are called away and the new toy is left in his room. Woody climbs to the bed to see the new toy. Woody discovers that Andy got a Buzz Lightyear action figure. Buzz does not realize he is just a toy and believes that he has crash landed on an alien planet. Buzz is a big hit with the other toys and soon becomes Andy's new favorite toy. All the attention that Buzz is getting makes Woody angry and jealous. Woody thinks of a way to get rid of Buzz and accidently knocks him out the window. Woody and Buzz wind up at Sid Phillips's home. Sid is known by Andy's toys as the toy killer. Sid likes to operates on toys and blow them up at well. Sid decides to blow-up Buzz, but due to a rainstorm has to wait the next morning. Woody and Buzz realize that they need each other and plan to help each other escape. Sid's alarm clock goes off before the two can escape. Sid takes Buzz to the backyard to get him ready to launch. Woody asks the mutant toys to help him because Buzz is the only friend he got. Woody and the mutant toys put into action a plan to rescue Buzz. The scare Sid out of his wits when the toys come alive and Woody starts talking and moving his lips. Sid flee for his life; scared of his toys. Woody frees Buzz and eventually returned to Andy.

1166787,5,7883704559,"Disney brought us some of the greatest classic tales through the wonder of animation. In 1995 a group of young upstarts brought the world a ground breaking phenomenon. It was the very first animated film entirely done by the wizardry of computers. Still, there was something else that came with this movie, an incredible original and heartfelt story that touches billions of people. To this day this one simple movie has created a legacy that will live to infinity and beyond.

'Toy Story', was a story unlike any other before its time. It was a creation that dived deep into our souls and brought out the inner child in all of us. Who ever thought that when the doors to our rooms are shut that our toys that we love come to life? Not only do they come to life but they have one mission and that is to keep whoever plays with them as happy as they possibly can. This tale also breaks the barrier of emotions and on the meaning of what it is to be a toy. What happens if one day a new toy comes along that is so much better than you? You might be replaced, thrown in a toy box and never see the light of day. And what happens when you get lost?! Well Toy Story shines the light on these tiny little things that you never would even think about when you put your toys away! These simple little things are what make 'Toy Story' the phenomenon that it is, but it also shows human beings themselves in a different way. Even the character that is set in this story to be a villain would never have realized that his acts were of a villainous nature, rather than just being a kid with certain interests. The voice acting is another thing that makes 'Toy Story' so great.  Each actor breathes amazing life into their role. Each character is unique and the humor that is used in this film is so original and so fresh, but the best part is it is toy humor.

This movie is probably one of the greatest movies ever, while compared to the Pixar films that followed a great deal has improved in the animation so this one would look just a bit crude. Unless you are a true film geek that likes to rag on the tiny details this is a film that you will never grow out of and to this day having seen this movie before I even got to high school it is still a movie that I treasure. It is in fact one of my favorite toys.",1278028800,,2301,4.177927927927928

1166791,5,7883704559,"I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, Rocky and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room; the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!!",1276992000,,802,4.389261744966443
1166833,4,7883704559,"for this review, i have only watched the blu ray so far, so i cannot comment on the dvd portion, or any bonus material.  the movie itself is wonderful.  as an adult, seeing all the old toys will be appreciated more by you than children.  the animation is wonderful, and blu ray looks great.  the colors are very crisp.  the picture jumps off my tv and its only a midrange flatscreen.  the rating i gave is judging this as a movie, not a ""childrens"" movie.

although i think this movie is great, this movie should not be rated G.  i found the namecalling with words like ""idiot"" and ""stupid"" unneccessary.  they could have either replaced the words with ""silly"", left out the word completely, or just rated it PG.  my 2 year old immediately repeated ""stupid dog"" to our puppy 5 times.

then there is Sid, the horrible little neighbor who isn't so nice to his toys.  his character itself is disturbing, mean, and could be upsetting to young children.  the movie is showing how toys really feel, and here Sid is hurting them.  it may be a little difficult to tell your young child this isn't real, and the toys aren't getting hurt.  again, just rate it PG.

then Sid is playing with matches and fireworks.  the character actually reads the box of fireworks outloud saying they are dangerous, and then goes to use them.  i think this is completely overboard for a G movie.  i try so hard to instill the dangers of playing with matches and fire, and here this movie is showing a child go to light fireworks carrying around a box of matches knowing they are dangerous.  woody himself tries to light the match.  whether they could have made the movie as complete using a different scenerio, i don't know.

G does not mean EVERYONE is going to like a movie, G means EVERYONE can watch it without upsetting even the youngest, most sensitive viewer.  although i watched this right next to my children, G rated means i shouldnt have to explain that the behavior in the movie as something we aren't suppose to repeat, like playing with matches or namecalling.  for clarification, shrek and beetlejuice have adult humor, but they are rated PG.  dora, diego, max and ruby, and wonderpets are suitable to be rated G.",1276646400,4,2201,4.553571428571429
1166834,5,7883704559,"Okay....here I go.... Absolutly wonderful film when I saw it for the first time in the theatre! Incredibly amazed and stunned by the first DVD release!

Now this Blu-Ray version - all I can say is FANTASTICALLY-MAGICAL-EYE-OPENING-STUNNING etc.! The clarity. The depth. The colors. Wow! And it just seems to be even more heart-warming, charming and even funnier too! How is that possible? The picture and sound quality I think are literally BETTER than it's original theatrical release - if that is possible! They have to be - simply because of the changing technologies!

You all should know by now that Toy Story is a 'buddy picture'. And without giving any spoilers -- its one of the best - ever made! You forget that is is a computer animated movie.  Tom hanks and Tim Allen are amazing together. So let me focus on the bonuses.

Beside the original stuff and the DVD that is included in this set - the extra extra extra bonuses on the Blu-Ray are really amazing. Retrospectives, more deleted scenes, art work, promotional stuff, marketing stuff, interviews, behind the scenes, the cast, the production, the memories, the fun! You get the idea?

It's all worth the price youpay for it. Disney's concept of including the DVD with the Blu-Ray version is genius. Why? Well you can take the DVD anywhere. Your Portable players, your car, school, work.....and the Blu-Ray is the premiere version of a now classic story. I am sure you will watch it more than once - especially this version!

If you haven't bought any version of Toy Story - this is the ONE to get! If you already have it - sell the old one here on Amazon and get this one to replace it! You won't regret it.

This is one of Pixar's best films ever - it relies on story and characters as the most important thing. For the price - you actually do get a lot more bang for your buck! 6-8-10",1275955200,5,1851,4.557228915662651

The picture is perfect because it comes straight from the details source.

A great film, memorable characters.  Buzz Lightyear is my favorite.  The flaw, still NOT a Randy Newman fan.

We ALL know the reason for this March 2010 DVD release was to promote the June 2010 release of ""Toy Story 3"".

For fans this DVD release is a let down.  YOU WILL DO MUCH BETTER WITH THE 2005 2 DISC DVD PACKAGE.  GO FIND 1 OF THOSE, THIS EDITION IF YOU WANT EXTRAS IS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

Only 1 disc compared to the 2005 2 disc edition.

A bunch of extras-ONLY FEW MENTIONED ON OUTSIDE DVD PACKAGE.  Most of them for kids.  I am a fan of the film, I want making of specials, actor information, etc.  Do NOT look for stuff like that here.  Go to the 2005 DVD 2 disc package.

NO chapter search list.  NO film information inside.

1166890,5,7883704559,"My first son was just 2 1/2 years old when I got him the Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack. I know this for sure because at the top of the Amazon Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack product page it says, ""You purchased this item on November 28, 2001."" Wow...how time flies.

So it was to my surprise that when my son, now 11, stayed home from school with a cold this past week, I found him watching Toy Story. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, ""What a great, classic movie, Dad; Let's watch Toy Story 2!"" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)

I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. So on the cusp of the release of Toy Story 3 in June 2010, I thought that I'd be sure to let all of my Amazon friends know that if you've not seen these movies, not only do they deserve a viewing before Toy Story 3 comes out, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. Perhaps I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had to these movies earlier this week, but I say that these two movies truly are collectors' items.

Like I was watching them for the first time earlier this week, I was laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.

The first is about Andy's (6 - 8 years old?) toys and what happens when Andy introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you.

Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are magic together in both movies and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).

And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz Lightyear&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-Channel-spinoff/dp/B00004T2SJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney Channel spinoff</a>&nbsp;but not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.

They remain fresh, funny, and engaging even after many viewings.

One of the reasons for ""Toy Story""'s perfection is that it combines technology and subject matter so well. If you were going to make the first feature-length computer-animated film, what could be a better subject than animism -- the belief that inanimate objects are inhabited by spirits? That idea has been around for thousands of years, and though ""Toy Story"" is not the first film presenting it (see, for example, Ladislav Starevich's ""The Mascot""), it does it spectacularly well.

A note to all you fundys complaining about magic and the black arts in Disney films... Why aren't you complaining about this one? Do you really want your kids to believe their toys ""come to life"" when no one's around? It's the work of Satan!

The Blu-ray transfer is, as I've gotten tired of writing about Disney films, spectacular. The ""extras"" include not only new material, but previous material from DVD editions.

1166942,5,7883704559,"When it comes to animated classics, ""Toy Story"" is definitely one title that is among a great group of titles.  Also, it was the first film for the CGI animation company Pixar, who would become the tour-de-force of creating animated CGI hits such as ""A Bug's Life"", ""Cars"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Up"", ""Wall-E"" to name a few.

And set for launch on June 18, 2010 is ""Toy Story 3"" and to celebrate the upcoming film, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will be releasing ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" on Blu-ray.

The first ""Toy Story"" was co-written and directed by animator and Pixar Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter who has worked with Disney since 1983 with ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" and co-written by Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft.

Released in 1995, ""Toy Story"" was a major success as the $30 million dollar film went on to make over $361 million worldwide.

VIDEO:

""Toy Story"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  For a film that was created back in 1995, ""Toy Story"" still looks beautiful on Blu-ray.  Sure, the detail is nowhere near what we see on the ""Toy Story 3' teaser (included on the special features) but the film just looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  For example, seeing the detail that was made for Rex the Tyrannosaurus, to the threading of the chairs, the vibrant colors of the film, the detail of the road and again, even for a film that is 15-years-old, it still rivals a few of the CG animated film and TV shows that we see in the present.  The film looks absolutely beautiful.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Toy Story"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Maser Audio and English 2.0 DTS-HD, English DVS 2.0 Dolby, Spanish and French Dolby Digital EX.  And again, for a 15-year-old film, ""Toy Story"" sounds magnificent on lossless.  From dialogue and Randy Newman's music coming from the front and center channels, surround and rear surround channels for the effects and LFE during the booms.  Audiophiles will be pleased that the lossless audio is quite immersive.  So, expect scenes such as Sid blowing up his action figures, the rocket on Buzz's back ignited, fallen toys and toys being scattered and much more.  I was very impressed by the lossless audio.

As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Toy Story"" is one of those films that is just a must-own in whichever format its released in and now that it will be available on Blu-ray, ""Toy Story: Special Edition"" is definitely worth it. I was impressed by how this 15-year-old film looks on Blu-ray and how much of the detail still pops out today.  As mentioned earlier, despite its age, it still looks better than a few CG animated TV shows and even some films that were released in the last five years.

Everything about this film still holds up today.  The CG animation, the voice acting is fantastic and overall story is well-written.

""Toy Story"" is where the Pixar magic all began.  This film catapulted Pixar Animation Studios as the most well-known animation studio in the planet and since then, every film created has been successful domestically and worldwide.

I know for many owners of the previous DVD release, one must wonder why must they upgrade again.  It all comes down to picture and audio quality.  And like most Pixar Blu-ray releases, this special edition Blu-ray release is full of special features.  This Blu-ray release is a no-brainer, in fact, you want to own both ""Toy Story"" BD releases because they are both quite worth it and watching it on HD was much better of an experience than I expected.

I will say that if you own the ""Ultimate Toy Box Set"" that was released in 1999, you will want to hang on to that set because although the Blu-ray's do have new additional content, a lot of content from the Ultimate Toy Box Set are NOT included on the Blu-ray release.

Granted, I know this will be a bummer for many, but the picture quality and the audio quality is so much better on the Blu-ray release plus you get new additional content.  So, the Blu-rays are definitely worth owning.

Overall, ""Toy Story: Special Edition"" is a fantastic film and because it is a pretty impressive upgrade, the Blu-ray release is the definitive version to own at this time.  Definitely recommended!",1269302400,6,7193,4.831147540983607

1167014,5,7883704559,"This is the first in the ""Toy Story"" franchise (1995) and the first film animated solely by computer. It establishes a family of toys owned by a boy named Andy who plays rough with his toys and writes his name on his favorites. This is really an action flick with toys rather than people being the superheroes engaged in intrepid rescues.
The toys fear birthdays and Christmases because Andy may get a new toy as a present; this new one may win him over, and some of his older ones may end up in a dumpster or out at a yard sale.
 The leader of the toy family is Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy puppet who plays some electric sounds if a wire in his back is pulled. Of course these toys can talk. The sequel to this movie was very good in filling in the back stories of the toys (Woody was a spin-off toy from a popular old TV series), and it individualized them. Bo Beep with her little crook in this one seems to have a crush on Woody.
 On his birthday Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), whom he prefers to Woody at first. Buzz thinks he's a real spaceman which makes him take crazy risks. Buzz and Woody have to save toys from the nasty, sadistic next-door kid named Sid and his vicious dog. Sid turns toys into mindless mutants. Sid really is an evil piece of work.
 People are the bad guys. Andy, a typical kid, is fickle about his toys. People are also dangerous for the toys because they are unpredictable.
This is a real kid's movie without any adult-aimed gags. When viewed with the second in the series, it provides some fun viewing because there's so much growth in ""Toy Story 2.""",1265328000,,1601,4.2772277227722775

I'm left with the feeling that the order was brought to the wrong address.  Lost Creek Circle and Lost Creek Court are just blocks from one another and mail is often confused.

1167017,5,7883704559,"A little boy named Andy loves to be in his room, playing with his toys, especially his doll named ""Woody"". But, what do the toys do when Andy is not with them, they come to life. Woody believes that he has life (as a toy) good. However, he must worry about Andy's family moving, and what Woody does not know is about Andy's birthday party. Woody does not realize that Andy's mother gave him an action figure known as Buzz Lightyear, who does not believe that he is a toy, and quickly becomes Andy's new favorite toy. Woody, who is now consumed with jealousy, tries to get rid of Buzz. Then, both Woody and Buzz are now lost. They must find a way to get back to Andy before he moves without them, but they will have to pass through a ruthless toy killer, Sid Phillips. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. This movie is pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, exciting, entertaining, and good for the whole family.",1264636800,,925,4.383720930232558

Whatever, ""Toy Story"" is a very clever animated story that was a big hit when it came out in 1995  and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and a third is scheduled for June 18, 2010 (yes, in 3-D).

When this ""original"" came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.  Still, this will always be a great film because it was
the humor in here, however, is what made this so popular.

There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.

Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner.""",1244246400,2,1361,4.599173553719008

1167299,5,7883704559,"The danger with being on the cutting edge of technology is that something that looks really cool one year can look horribly dated by the end of the next year (I'm looking at you Tron!)  The only way to avoid being relegated to the technological scrap bin is to make the story and characters the emphasis, so that you forget what you're watching.  When Toy Story first came out, it was impossible not to talk about how it looked.  That's not the reason people continue to watch it, though.  They continue to watch it because it's funny, heartwarming, and genuinely entertaining.

As every child knows, Toys are living beings, and have their own lives when not being played with.  Sherriff Woody is Andy's favourite Toy, and thus the leader of Andy's toy chest, which includes a neurotic T. Rex, a know-it-all piggy bank, and Mr. Potato Head.  Into the mix is introduced the new cool toy: Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear, and Woody is supplanted as Andy's favourite.  One thing leads to another and soon Woody and Buzz are Lost Toys trying to find their way home.

The key to the film is the performances (both animated and voice).  Pixar was smart enough not to try to make a full-length film until they were ready: their computer models can fully express emotions in the face, in body language, and most importantly in the eyes.  Adding in the supurb voice talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and these animations come to life.  Allen and Hanks were minor actors  when they supplied the voices of the two main characters, but they were supurbly cast (pre-Home Improvement and pre-Philadelphia, respectively).  Supporting voices by John Ratzenberger (in full Cliff Claven mode) and Don Rickles make the voice acting in this film among the best of any animated film ever made.

At the heart of the film is a standard buddy story (starting from a point where the main characters hate, or at least cannot understand, each other).  Plotwise, there's nothing new here.  But the execution and the attention to small details give this story a fresh look, just as computer animation was giving a fresh look to animation in general.  Many (including myself) are very disappointed in Disney for going completely to computer animation - Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, etc. are ultimately better looking than any of the Pixar films.  But with Toy Story, the style of animation fits so well that I cannot imagine it any other way.

This 10th anniversary 2-DVD set is a nice value.  There are some neat extras, not the least of which is a detailed directors/writers commentary.  There are also some reflections on the film made 10 years later, as well as some deleted/altered scenes, which are always interesting to see.  Most interesting is probably the storyboard presentations of two alternate beginnings - an Andy fantasy of a shootout with Woody, and a version of the beginning that eventually became Toy Story 2's opening sequence.",1231804800,,2914,4.818913480885312

Of course, there are many plotting inaccuracies. How come the Toys have never been caught moving? Their early warning system seems a little hap-hazard to say the least. And when Scud the dog is pulling Woody off the back of the removal truck, the loading ramp would have to be about 5 feet off the ground making Scud the size of a Shetland pony! And when they light the rocket, it is unlikely that Woody would be able to steer RC because of the small size of the wheels compared to the thrust applied, and when Woody falls limp in the petrol station as the big tanker arrives, the wheel that nudges up against him is not the front wheel, but one of the rear wheels on the tractor unit, he would have been crushed by that stage. And why didn't the truck driver or the car drivers at the end see the toys and report it to the press? And surely RC would have been thrown away by Andy as Woody drops the remote control in the road when the battery runs out, and RC would be no-good without a remote. And how come some toys speak and some don't, and how does Lenny speak, he has no mouth? And how come Mr Potatohead never loses any of his parts that drop off all of the time? And anyone who has ever played the drop and grab games that Buzz and Woody are ""won"" by Sid in know that the air displaced by a cruising jetliners 36,000 feet overhead will displace anything you manage to pick up, so Woody would have been able to pull Buzz free easily. And when Sid's toys pop out the light housing in the porch to lower Duckie to ring the bell, the hole is too small to get the fitting back in again. And when Buzz falls out of the window, why doesn't he just stand in the drive and wave up saying he is ok? And what happens to the paratroopers that drop off the landing at the start, when the other troops abseil down the skipping rope, they have gone. And why should Woody have a Laser? He is a cowboy!
Some people (""Johnny One-Stars"", I call them) will believe the above comments are serious.

As you can see, I have seen this film too many times, and seriously, I love it. Suitable for kids from 2 to 102. Mind you, my granny is 103 and I couldn't recommend it for her since I persuaded her that the Nirvana lyric, ""can you feel my love buzz"" was been sung by Woody and it ruined it for her.

The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever.

1167380,3,7883704559,"I wasn't quite sure how to rate this movie.  I have always been a fan of Disney movies and this one just did not feel good like other ones.

The story is about two toys getting lost, and found by a bad boy who mistreats toys (for example, he cuts off the heads of toy figures and puts the heads in lava lamps to float around).  The two toys who got lost in the first place hate each other until the end of the movie, so they are bickering the whole time while trying to escape the dark atmosphere of the bad boy's room.  Of course every story has an antagonist that generates an antagonistic feeling, I feel that TOO much of this movie was spent in the dark atmosphere.  All the name-calling between Woody, Buzz, Potato Head, etc just bugged me.  The end of the story turns out wonderful, of course, and some of the scenes are really fun and heartwarming -- but really I don't get a good feeling from this movie in general.

It's not something I particularly like my kids watching.  I cringe every time my 3-year-old asks to see ""The Buzz Movie.""  He LOVES Buzz, who is the main ""good guy"" in the movie, and I let him have a Buzz-decorated bedroom at his request.  But I limit how much he can actually watch this movie and try to counter it with more generally positive movies like Cars, Finding Nemo, or shows on Noggin.",1216512000,6,1321,4.269076305220883

1167383,5,7883704559,"I bought this back when it was $45 used, and I considered it a steal then. The Toy Story movies are absolute classics, no question about it. Even as computer animation gets better and better, these movies don't feel dated at all. (hint to Dreamworks: it's because the movies are filled with rich characters, not weak pop-culture references masquerading as ""jokes."")

There are better versions of the movies available, but the differences are small and the Toy Box is a bit cheaper than getting the other editions separately (as of 6/4/2008, at least). You miss out on a few special features, but most of the ones on the other editions are taken from this set. The picture quality is also ever-so-slightly better on the other editions (although picture quality is not a problem at all on this set).

It should also be mentioned that the DVD packaging on this set is beautiful. The DVDs come in standard cases housed in a silvery box with wireframe versions of some of the characters from the films printed on it. A clear plastice slipcase goes over that, with the fully-rendered versions of the characters replacing the wireframe versions. It's pretty clever, really.

The other editions are here, if you really must have the very best versions of them:

Even Monsters has the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing each other (especially by the villain Randall).

Even the added ""deleted"" scenes are just in storyboard fun - wow, that's exciting to a kid. NOT. Just like the interviews with the film-maker, actors, etc. Great for adult movie buffs but for kids, it's a real snooze.

So, for some adults looking to build out their collection or who have a real interest in what the guys behind the film think of their accomplishment, sure, go ahead and get it.

I, for one, do NOT allow my children to use language like 'moron', 'loser', 'dirtbag' or 'idiot', which language is found in this movie by the truckload. I would certainly never allow my children to pretend that they were threatening to hang someone from a gallows, as the toys threaten to do to ""Woody"". I guess that when TV/DVDs have become, once again in this generation, the babysitter/parent, we can get fooled into thinking that such a 'nice' movie about some 'nice' toys can't be all bad. I guess the people who get sucked into buying the movie for their kids won't mind if their kids interact with one another using language and scenarios like these I mentioned. The minute I began to even suspect that the world of ""Toy Story"" and it's values were going to be reflected in my childrens' lives, I couldn't throw the blasted thing out fast enough, and if you want your kids to grow up a little different than the TV-bred cretins around them, you'll do the same.",1136764800,32,1165,4.632850241545894
1167559,5,7883704559,"A timeless tale. Computer animation has advanced much in ten years, but ""Toy Story"" is still a true masterpiece for the entire family. A true visual treat to watch and featuring a strongly absorbing plot.

For anyone that might not know yet, just a quick rundown --- Woody, a cowboy, is a toy that has been a boy, Andy's favorite for many years. Sharing Andy's room with a whole collection of other toys, he's become a sort of unofficial leader. Everything changes, though, when a birthday party for Andy brings a new toy. Buzz Lightyear has wings, glows in the dark, has an electronic voicebox and even karate chop action. To top off, he doesn't even know he's a toy! Pretty soon, it seems like Buzz has become Andy's favorite and Woody is getting left behind. Then, circumstances come together so that Woody and Buzz have to work together to save their own lives and be reunited with Andy. The film features several great songs --- ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" (and closing credits version), ""Strange Things"" and ""I Will Go Sailing No More."" (All composed and performed by Randy Newman, with Lyle Lovett joining on the closing credits version of ""Friend in Me."")

For those enjoying the movie anew, or for the first time, the DVD experience is great. It features enhanced picture quality and new 5.1 Surround Sound. The movie is fully digitally mastered and also featured French and Spanish audiotracks, as well as subtitles and close-captioning. And, to top it all off, there's also a commentary track with several of the movie staff, as well as many others popping in briefly throughout. I'm very glad they went with this and resisted the temptation of going with something goofy, like commentary by the toys or something.

The ""Toy Story"" 10th Anniversary Edition DVD brims with special features just waiting to be checked out. There are deleted/extended scenes featuring stuff that either was slowing the movie down, or ultimately wasn't working for the movie anymore, such as an alternate opening featuring the Buzz Lightyear Show. There are retrospective lookbacks at the film from VIPs such as film critics, movie/Pixar staff and even Buzz Aldrin.

There's an exclusive look at the upcoming Disney/Pixar film ""Cars,"" with the promise of more to come on the ""Toy Story 2"" DVD release. There are also trailers that I hadn't seen before for the upcoming ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""Little Mermaid"" Disney Platinum Edition releases.

Another great special feature is Randy Newman Demos for all of the songs in the film. It doesn't stop there, though --- there are also a few Randy Newman demos of songs that didn't make into the movie, including two versions of ""Plastic Spaceman,"" a pretty good song that was eventually replaced by the even-better ""I Will Go Sailing No More.""

There are more special features as well, but I'll let these be a surprise.

One little bit that's pretty cute are a series of a short skits accessible by hitting the star buttons scattered throughout the second disc. These play entirely new animations featuring the Toy Story characters and while it sounds like a couple of the voices may have been changed, it sounded to me that for the most part they were able to get the original cast. These are also accessible from an index, in case you find it hard to find and follow all the stars.

On top of all these great special features, it's nice to know that the people who put together the DVD didn't forget the little things. Every menu option has a time indicator next to it, so you know exactly what you're getting into ahead of time. On top of all of that, here's a great feature that's really rare --- all special features are fully close-captioned!",1133654400,6,3684,4.754303599374022
1167560,5,7883704559,"The movie's the same - that is to say, ""awesome.""  But what's even more awesome about this new DVD release are the video and audio standards.  The toys always looked terrific, no matter what release format we were watching, but now... details in the backgrounds leap out like never before (check out the really grungy floor in Sid's room), even soft edges stay more defined and in focus and difficult colors like red are truer and no longer bleed.  The audio offers much sharper detail, a truer, more up-front sound and wider dynamic and frequency ranges.  It's as if someone took window cleaner and polished up the whole presentation.  IMO, Pixar's higher bit-rate really paid off - to the point where viewing other DVDs in my collection is now a bit disappointing!  Talk about setting a benchmark.

I didn't mention that you no longer need to buy the big 3-disc set to get the special ""making-of"" features.  Just one caveat: I'm sorry that ""Tin Toy"" wasn't included this time around.

Now I can't wait to see what TS2 is going to be like!  ""Tin Toy,"" anybody?

1167564,5,7883704559,"Pixar in many ways are developing into one of my favorite animation studios. Disney, especially in recent years is basically just churning the movies out because they know it'll guarantee a profit. What happened to Bambi? Cinderella? Lion King? Even Fantasia. But Pixar came in and changed things for the better so hopefully Disney gets their act together because if Pixar so far has been 5 for 5(even though I only marginally like Monsters Inc).

It's the classic case of the leader being upstaged by the new kid. While human Andy is out of the room, his toys decide to play and chatter amongst themselves. Woody, a cowboy doll, is its probably unofficial leader. Until Andy's birthday party where Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure which impresses everyone, excluding Woody of course.

Overwhelmed by jealousy, he knocks Buzz out the window which of course gets Woody in trouble. Buzz follows Woody as Andy's going out for pizza. And of course Woody can't show up back home unless Buzz is with him. This all ends up culminating in both of them being caught in neighbour Sid's house, basically a toy destroyer.

One scene in the film in a way sums up the film for me: deciding to pay back Sid, the toys go all attack mode and reveal they're real with Woody providing comical creepiness. It's the charm of the entire scene that still makes me laugh, especially the ""we toys can see everryyythiinnng"".

The film is also littered with little inside jokes. Don Rickles had a catchphrase of ""what are you looking at, you hockey puck?"" So it makes sense his character says it to a hockey puck. The late Jim Varney playing Slinky says a catchphrase that Jim used to say as his most famous alter-ego Ernest P. Worrell. Toy Story also has such great characters with one of my favorites being these toy aliens you get in one of those manual-controlled vending machines where you gotta catch your prize. With their big nasal voice and their cult-like attitude towards the machine's claw, they're still funny.

Hopefully this is the last double dip by Pixar. I mean A Bug's Life had an original DVD release with no features, then an overpriced Collector's Edition than a traditionally priced 2 disc. Even Toy Story was on DVD I believe twice before this. But c'est la vie and even still this is still a good movie.",1128816000,,2309,4.691358024691358

But when the two toys get lost a couple days before Andy moves, they'll have to work together to get home.  Can Woody work with Buzz when they don't have the same goal?

I can't believe it's been ten years since this movie came out.  It's had an immeasurable impact on the animation field and movies in general.  At the same time, its flaws are evident.  The humans look as plastic as the toys, and the fur on the dog is laughable.  Computers have come a long way in ten years.

Whether this movie was any good or not, it would have been an important milestone.  Fortunately, it succeeds on an entertainment level as well.  The story is masterfully told revealing plot points and character equally.  The movie is extremely funny as well; with lots of jokes for the adults in the audience and some classic lines I quote all the time.  Plus it introduces us to a Pixar staple, the climax that will not quit.

Pixar has released great DVD's from the start, and this two-disc set is no different.  The movie is transferred directly from the digital files, so the picture is perfect.  Sound is wonderful in two separate 5.1 surround tracks.  Many of these extras are from the Ultimate Toy Box release of a few years ago, and they are well worth having.  The commentary is very informative.  The deleted scenes are interesting, but it's obvious why they were deleted.  The new features looking back at the movie from ten years later are wonderful as well.

I don't have one of those flashy home-theater outfits, but this digital print shows off some great color, with the various toy characters in pristine, bright glory. Sound master Gary Rydstrom upgraded the soundtrack to the point where you can hear the click of the tiny toy soldiers. Best of all, you don't need a 50-inch screen or ultra-Dolby amp to enjoy this newer-than-new view.

  The movie, of course, introduced a new, innovative animation outfit called Pixar to the world- and what a job they did on this first feature effort! Woody and Buzz Lightyear, of course, are icons to kids of all ages, but all the other members of the ""Andy's Room"" community were great- and funny. Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and even the little green Army sergeant (war-movie vet R. Lee Ermey) are just a few of these classic inanimate objects turned flesh-and-blood- well, almost- characters.

  The storyline- a combination of buddy comedy, toy fair, sci-fi flick and domestic sitcom (to name a few elements) is, in its own way, as multi-layered and satisfying as the most mature adult dramas. From the moment all the toys come to life when Andy's away to a great exit line when the toys learn about his latest surprise gift, you're drawn in to this unusual world that's as striking now as it must have been a decade ago.

  Disc 1 has both the movie and a new feature with both the Pixar team and a few others (Chris ""Robots"" Wedge, George Lucas, Roy Disney) offering their views on what ""Toy Story"" did to transform the entire animation genre. It's Disc 2, however, that has the goods- a couple of dozen features, clips and art galleries that literally break down the walls and give both the kid/family core crowd and the animation scholar a remarkable look at how much effort goes into this sort of film. The fact that Pixar and the CGI form themselves were in their infancy at the time only enhances just what great craftsmen these people are.

  After an entertaining coffee-talk session involving Pixar's ""four horsemen""- the core writer/artist/director/geeks who helmed every future project up to ""The Incredibles""- we can check out everything from sequence development, sketch to full-on; galleries on characters like Woody and Buzz set to music; a multi-language sequence (from Finnish to Chinese to Turkish!); even Randy Newman's original piano-and-voice (and he's a fantastic piano player!) demo score. Nothing- I say, nothing- is out of place.

  ""Toy Story"" is simple enough to be an ideal choice for a ""child's first movie"" yet sophisticated enough to give the serious cineaste plenty to study. It's as witty as the best literate comedies and as warm as an old-style family saga. It proved that top-drawer stars could also be great voice actors, and it entered a child's world with a fresh, not-so-""kiddie"" angle. It balanced off sweet little Andy with mad-scientist Sid (his mutant monster-movie toy creations are a show in themselves)

in a great show of kids with personality. And it established Pixar as the flagship of animated features- again, it's incredible that this was their first!

  ""Toy Story"", the super-deluxe edition, is a must for any animation buff, family with kids, or just about anyone who loves movies. I'm already on line for the upcoming (New Year's) ""Toy Story 2"" set, which will give its equally-great sequel (dare I say the ""Godfather"" and ""Godfather II"" of animation?) the format it deserves. With any luck, ""Toy Story"" will be one of the best-loved movies ever, to infinity...and beyond!",1126742400,23,3876,4.9019908116385915

I really enjoyed watching it when I saw it for the 1st time, and I knew that I had to get it.

Had Toy Story bombed at the Box office I doubt there would be any Pixar today and Disney would not be scrambling to resign Pixar becuase they know Every movie from Pixar is a hit so Disney is stupid not to resign Pixar.  Disney needs Pixar as much as Pixar needs Disney. Just look back at the Past few Years Disney has not released a Blockbuster Hit since Mulan the only hits they have had has been the ones with Pixar.  Who would have thought it all statrted with a movie about toys. Toy Story is great for all ages 5 stars I never got the chance to own Toy Story on dvd it was back in the vault quicker then they could turn the key.

I own this dvd bought it on Day 1 the picture is crystal clear it looks awesome.  The sound is much improved. They have really made this movie shine.  Hard to believe this movie is already 10 years old. If you are a disney fan this is a must own.  If you own the previous versions to me 16 dollars is worth picking up this edition.  It looks much better then the previous dvd release and has some new features.  I guarantee if you like Disney and pixar movies this is the movie to get.",1126137600,,1374,4.022058823529412

The video has been cleaned up with a higher bit rate (the original looked super to begin with!) and the sound is much improved with new options that weren't available before now.

The only negative I can see is the failure to include a short and I'm not even sure it's worth mentioning. I remember all of the Pixar films having a short except for maybe this one. The VHS release didn't have one but the original DVD release had one called ""Tin Toy"". Was this one even released with the movie or just on the original DVD? Try for the life of me, I just can't recall. I checked it out on the Pixar site and it sure didn't look familiar and we sure aren't missing much but it sure seems weird to have included this in an earlier DVD release but to leave it out from the 10th Anniversary, 2-disc version. It just makes the package seem a little incomplete somehow.

Other than the minor omission of a short, this excellent package should be in everyone's collection, even if you don't have kids or grandkids! If you have an original DVD release, pick this one up too. There are enough improvements and new features to make the extra $16 worthwhile.",1126137600,,1294,4.320987654320987

It also has wonderful bonus features including ""The Making Of Toy Story"",which is the first ever Toy Story making of featurete,which explains how they thought up all the charectors including Woody and Buzz!

The plot of this film is awesome,with a touch of friendship lesson in it! The movie is about a cowboy doll named Woody. When his owner Andy gets a new toy called Buzz Lightyear for his birthday,Woody is jeaules because he is no longer the center of attention with Andy.

The reason Toy Story works so well is that whereas lots of movies feature toys coming to life, usually it involves the tired theme of a Fairy Godmother tapping the toy on the noggin to make it animate.  With Toy Story, the toys only spring into action when people aren't around.

The characters are great.  Tom Hanks (Woody) usually gets the accolades, but I believe Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear, or Light Beer, or Light Snack) steals the show.  Toy Story is one of those movies in which EVERYTHING works, and one which is equally enjoyable to kids and adults.",1125360000,,732,4.352941176470588

1167635,5,7883704559,"The ""Toy Story"" movies helped usher in a new era for Disney, as the company slowly moved away from the standard animated films that made them famous (reserving them for direct to video sequels) and started breaking grounds in the field of computer animation. This has since spawned some of the House of Mouse's best films, including ""A Bug's Life"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"".

I will dwell on plot details, though I will say that the large accumilation of voice talents (led by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Annie Potts, Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer) is the best cast ever assembled for a Disney movie. Instead, I will talk about this two dvd set. You get both films, obviously. (It should be noted that ""Toy Story 2"" is one of the few sequels that was better than the firs, which was great in its own right). But you are also treated to some extras. For starters, you get the option of watching the films in either full screen or widescreen. You don't get a lot of bonus features, but you get the Oscar nominated short films, ""Tin Toy"" (which won) and ""Luxo Jr."" ""Toy Story 2"" also has a hilarious outtakes reel at the end that is very fun to watch.

The whole concept of toys talking and having 'lives' is so fun for any child..and adults alike :)

Toy Story mixes humor, action, adventure, and even the tiniest bit of horror {that Sid kid is creepy!} ;] All the qualities needed to make an instant classic!

But now with this Two-Disk Edition I can now get all of these amazing special features for a low,low price. So far, I cant tell you much about the DVD, but I will get to that later.

First, the movie. Toy Story premiered in 1995, and when I went to see it in theatres I was utterly amazed. I hadnt seen any fully CG movie until then. The story was unique, the charcters were lovable, and the movie is unforgetable. Evryone knows that Toy Story has paved the way for all of our CG movies, now-a-days. If TS would have bombed at the box office, maybe there would be no Finding Nemo, no Shrek, and no Monsters Inc.! This was the first movie that was put out by Disney and Pixar which is now a very profitable arrangement.

The DVD is also expected to be freakin' awesome! This is the first time this movie has been in print in over 2 1/2 years! The DVD is expected to have almost all the extras from the Toy Box plus some other amazing features.  It is expected to have interviews with the original actors, also includes a nice ""roundtable discussion"" with the movie's creaters including the Disrector (John Lasseter)as well as writers, as well as an amzing behind the scenes making of featurette. Deleted scenes, New games, music videos, audio commentaries, and much more! (From Disney's Press Release)

- Shown in the 1:77:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen)

- Encoded with highest DVD bit-rate ever used for a Disney/Pixar

In fact this movie shattered new grounds back in 1995 by not using drawing cel animation and instead this movie is the first of an unbroken chain of computer generated animated movies that has continued to date with ""Finding Nemo"".
 The plot is absolutely joyful and stunningly original. The story revolves around the quiet family home of a quiet town where a boy owns numerous toys with his toddler sister. The toys however, are almost like beings of their own and are 'living' as well but stop 'moving' when the boy comes back into his room. However, a cowboy named Tim is the most popular 'toy' in the boys bedroom and is kept by the pillow almost every night until on his birthday, he gets a fancy astronaut toy named Buzz Lightyear who has many 'gizmos' and in time takes over the toy cowboys place as the most popular toy and Tim gets enormously jealous of this. However, after a botched attempt to remove Buzz, the cowboy himself along with Buzz end up in the hands of a punk teenager who takes joy in blowing up toys with firecrackers and or other means like burning, breaking, or smashing them and/or even taking them apart and re-assembling their parts to create 'mutant' toys and now the clock is ticking for Tim and Buzz to escape from the boys house before they end up being blown to molecules.
 This movie is absolutely fun and original even by 1995 standards. The computer generated special effects are innovative and unbelievable especially considereing the fact that this movie came out nearly a whole decade ago. The whole tone of the movie is just fun and charming and is for the entire family.

1167713,5,7883704559,"Toy story is the first animated feature and one the best animated film of any kind. Disney's discontinued single dvd features great picture and sound. I don't know if all this disney sending films back to the vault is a scam for later release. I guess the film is also availbe with toy story 2 with a bonus disc, because frankly there aren't any bonuses on this disc. This single disc of the film can still be found in some stores, but it keeps on getting harder to find it. It looks like amazon still has some too.
Toy story proved to the world the art that could be created from cg animation. Unfortunatley integration of cgi into live action and animation continues to be sketchy at best. Even big films like lotr has many obviously fake shots. On the other hand animations that rely on soley cg graphics are extremely effective, got to love finding nemo. Really only humans come across as unrealistic in toy story and animation has continued to do a better job in that category. The film is a wonder of anyone who remembers a childhood filled with a wide variety of toys. Toy story's fantasy world of toys come to life is so effective because the toys are based on real children's toys. The film's best scenes make use of the practical abilities of the toys. So much charming humor resonates from these scenes. Like spirited away the fantasy world is totally realistic in its own terms and visually a wonder. Toy story has one up on spirited away because it has a strong narrative due to woody's jealousy of buzz. Sure the film shifts to a standard villian, but having woody as a flawed personality makes the character so much more alive. The sequel is good, but as i remember i liked the orginal better.
Picture quality on the dvd is flawless and beautiful. Presented in original aspect ratio 1:77:1, limited black bars for small tvs. Still i remember kiki's delivery service as the best looking dvd print, but toy story's is perfect, if maybe a little soft. Sound is magnificant wonderful bass and separation and extremely clean. A top above the call of duty sound track in 5.1.
Extras are a problem, i belive a three pack release had some stuff, but this one doesn't. Only pixar's early cgi tin toy short is included and its not that great.
Toy Story is a wonderful film for all ages that brings glory to cg animation and Disney's discontinued dvd is stunning in picture and sound, but lacks any extras of value.

Pixar really came up with something wonderful in these two stories, both provide such engaging accounts of one's [longing] for toys of the past.  My kids treasure these two movies and the dialog is witty enough to draw parents into the stories.  Toy Story II builds on the former, introducing a wider range of characters and offering a light-hearted parable on the collection mania in America.  One too many out of the frying pan and into the fire situations for my taste, but the action keeps kids enthralled throughout.  Hanks and Allen lend great voice to the battling lead characters, and there are many other wonderful voices as well. The only drawback (and it is a mild one) is not mixing Pixar toys with real family members.  I think that would have made the stories even more compelling.",1065398400,16,919,4.7421383647798745

I sat through a number of mediocre cartoon movies but, occassionally, I got to see a movie that we all really enjoyed.  Tops in that category is ""Toy Story"".  This movie is the ideal family movie because it can be enjoyed by every age group.  Younger children seem to enjoy anything as long as it's a cartoon.  Older children can pick up on the jealosies and competition.  Adults will pick up on the subtle banter between the characters.  Everyone will enjoy the humor and there's plenty of excitement and suspense as well.  The art work is very good but the best part are the actors whose voices we hear.  Robin Williams in ""Alladin"" sets a pretty high mark but the sum total of the quality of all the voice characterizations in ""Toy Story"" is probably a team record.  From the beginning to the end the movie is entertaining.  Thanks to Randy Newman, it even has good music as well.

The relationship between Woody and Buzz goes from jealousy and hate, but once they're put in a situation where they are left to fend for themselves in order to survive, all that changes into learning how to accept each other for their differences and becoming friends. It definitely contains valuable lessons for children young and old, and maybe children will learn how to treat their toys better.

Toy Story is an exquisitely crafted tale that deals simply, yet brilliantly, with deeply human themes. The toys of Andy's room are forced by circumstance to deal with all the complexities of love and friendship--jealousy, fear, forgiveness, rejection, acceptance--and they do so in a charming way that will warm the hearts of children and grown-ups alike. There is something authentic about cowboy doll, Woody, whose toy-child relationship with Andy becomes threatened when new kid on the block, Buzz Lightyear, suddenly replaces him as favourite. There is something down-to-earth and believable about the vulnerability we see in the characters, and something beautifully real about the way these issues become resolved. It is a tale that will strike a chord with any of us.
Of course, this is also a very funny and exciting movie that entertains and delights, though what really draws me in is how all this becomes an education for us, as we are brought face-to-face with what it means to be human.

In Toy Story, Tom Cruise plays Woody, a lovable cowboy who starts out as Andy's favourite toy.  Other toys include the nervous TRex, Hamm, Little Bo Peep, an Etch a Sketch, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinkey Dog (voiced by the late Jim Varney).  At Andy's birthday party, Woody gathers the toy troops to find out what new presents Andy got for his birthday.  Woody soon dicovers that his popularity is in question when a new toy enters Andy's life, Buzz Lightyear (played by Tim Allen).  Woody gets a little jealous of the attention Buzz gets.  With all the fun little gadgets Buzz comes with, he only has one flaw- he doesn't realize he's just a toy.  Woody causes more trouble for Buzz than he had intended when the 2 of them wind up outside Andy's house.  To rectify this, Woody tries his best to get himself and Buzz back to Andy's house and away from the clutches of bratty neighbour Sid.  The DVD includes The Tin Toy, a 1988 film by Pixar.
Both movies feature the musical score of the talented Randy Newman and the winsome song ""You've Got a Friend in Me.""
Toy Story 2 starts out with Andy going away to Cowboy Camp.  He can't take Woody with him after Woody nearly loses his right arm.  However, someone else is interested in Woody- greedy Toy Barn owner Al, who gets possession of Woody and plans to use Woody in an exhibition in Japan.  Here, Woody finds out that he came from an old Western show for kids called Woody's Roundup.  Here he meets the Roundup Gang.  There's Bullseye the horse, Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer) and the feisty but vulnerable Jessie (Joan Cusak).  It's up to Buzz to help Woody see there's more happiness in being Andy's toy than being on display with nobody to play with.  Other new characters include Buzz's supercool nemesis Zurg, who's introduced in the beginning of the movie and the cute Wheezy the penguin.  This DVD also features outtakes which were shown during the credits and the cartoon short Luxo, jr, who wound up as the mascot for Pixar.
And now for the extra disk, give yourself a week or 2 to enjoy all the features which include interviews with the animators, producers and some of the voices.  Outtakes, animation secrets, inside jokes and full-length commentaries of both movies are included.  Demos of Randy Newman's songs and a video from Riders in the Sky performing the ""Woody's Roundup Theme"" are included as well as the history of the original concepts that Pixar worked on.

1167799,5,7883704559,"One cannot say enough in praise of these two brilliant films. The Toy Story films are as close to perfect entertainment as movies get. By using the overused adjective perfect, I am simply stating that the two films contained in this superbly packaged collector's edition filled overflowing with top flight extras geared for all DVD fanatics, stand as the rare example of stories that the entire family can watch, savor and revel in.
I define a perfect film as one that is not only expertly crafted in coordinating all the creative elements, but one that also teaches profound lessons while being pure escapist fun that, while appealing to all ages of an audience, also remains fresh and lucid after many repeated viewings. My personal definition of a perfect film also includes the following elusive criteria: that if one possibly could, it would be most desirable to step out of real life and into the imagined world of the film. The classic musical ""Singin' In The Rain"" is just one example of a film that meets this ""perfect film"" criteria. If I could take a few films onto a deserted island, this box set would be included without a doubt.
Teaching the lessons of loyalty, imagination, faith, perseverance, courage and hope, Pixar has crafted two films that truly teach while entertain. No small feat considering the profoundly expansive amount of shallow garbage populating the multi-plexes. Both films earn their happy endings honestly without cheap manipulation. A rare and valuable miracle in of itself.
Pixar's visual paintings are eye-wateringly beautiful to behold. Every frame vibrates in rich color, texture and detail. The writing is crisp, witty, and deceptively literate. It is amazing how both films deftly confront in concepts of mortality and community without resorting to maudlin and sentimental meanderings. The vocal performances of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and a rich supporting cast provide subtetly and humanity to all the fantastic proceedings.
The theme song ""You've Got a Friend In Me"" is a most charming testaments to companionship. Especially the version with Randy Newman singing a duet with Lyle Lovette. The inclusion of the always excellent Riders in the Sky for the second film also gives the film a fine musical nuance.
It really is tragic that the Oscars and ""serious"" critics overlooked these phenomenal films which stand as sterling examples of mainstream Hollywood ""getting it right"".

The Movies:
The stories are great. The original ""Toy Story"" is a wonderful flashback to the film that has inspired so much since. ""Toy Story 2"" is, in my opinion, even better. Neither are technically advanced compared to recent movies, but that's not what's important. The plots and characters are the best you'll ever find in children's entertainment. Half of the jokes will fly over the younger viewers heads, but will keep the adults in stitches. I can't praise these movies enough, they were made from the heart, not the wallet.
The Discs:
My only complaint about the discs, really a minor annoyance, is that the sound volume on the menus is really loud. The menus are fun, with lots to explore. In the ""extras"" dept, there's very little lame content created just to fill space, it's all there for the fans.",1041638400,2,995,4.595505617977528

Slowly, Woody starts to feel as if he's getting replaced by Buzz and in an attempt to win Andy's affection back, they both instead get LOST! And now it's a race to find their way back to Andy in time of the move.
In Toy Story 2, Woody is kidnapped because he's accidentily dropped in a box for a garage sale. His kidnapper, Al (Wayne Knight) is a classic toy collector and then Woody finds out that he was also a national phenomenon just like Buzz is. He also finds the rest of Woody's Round Up Gang, Jessie (Joan Cusak) and Stinky Peter (Kelsey Grammar) and they tell him that now that the Round Up Gang was complete that they were going to the Toy Museum in Japan. Woody not wanting any part of that, tries to find ways to escape and get back to Andy while his friends, led by Buzz, Slink the Dog, Mr Potatohead, Rex the T-Rex and Ham are on the hunt to find Woody before Andy gets home.
Seriously, how can you go wrong with either of these classics? This is one of the best DVD sets I own and probably one of my favorites.

Around the time the first ""Toy Story"" came out, I had been disappointed with some of Disney's 90's animated features (namely ""Pocahontas"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"").  Disney storytellers were getting a bit too serious.  Well, they brought the wide-eyed fun quality back, and this time they coupled it with the most groundbreaking, realistic animation I had ever seen.
Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and other gifted cast members do wonderful voice work.  Don't mean to sound cliche, but they really bring life to the characters, just as the plot brings life to toys.  The humor/comic timing is right on.  There are enough madcap moments to keep kids entertained and enough inside/background jokes for adults to have a laugh.

In this sequel, Woody, Buzz and the whole gang are back.  This time Andy is headed off to camp and mom decides to sell off some of the older toys.  In an attempt at a rescue, Woody gets stolen by a maniacal toy collector.  Turns out Woody belongs in a collection of three (together with Jessie the Cowgirl, and Stinky Pete the prospector).  When Woody's friend realize what has happened, they form a rescue mission of their own.  Tracking down the collector was easy because of his chicken-suit commercial promoting the toy store he works at called the Toy Barn.  The rest of the movie just has to be watched.
As Doug Thomas puts in his editorial review, this story is about the ""eternal debate of living a good life versus living forever.""  What happens when a toy's owner grows old and slowly forgets about the toy?  The conclusion I gathered from the film is that it's more important to be loved (and have loved) than not to have been loved (and love) at all.  And when the owner goes away, the saying ""Besides, that's what friends are for."" just warms the heart.  When all is said and done, we see that the toys have a lot of fun on their own anyway ;).
There is a more complicated theme I found in the story.  (Forgive me if the symbolism seems a bit far fetched.)  When Buzz sings ""You've got a friend in me..."" it forces Woody to choose between family (the collection that'll last forever in a museum, much like how family is forever) and his friends (Buzz and his rescue party).  Woody is torn between the two.  Should he go back home to his friends and owner, or should he get memorialized in a museum for the world to see.  And I think the film's resolution of this matter was well done.  Initially, the family pulls more weight (Woody chooses to stay with Jessie and Pete), but when the dust settles life just isn't complete (he changes his mind which angers Pete and gives stinky real meaning).  The best thing to do is have your cake and eat it to.  Bring family and friends together.  Let the choice be both.  Who says they can't get along?  And if they can't, well, relationships aren't set in stone.  All it takes is some common ground, something to agree on.

1167853,5,7883704559,"Truth to say, I really didn't expect to like this feature. I never even saw it in its theatrical run. I finally saw this film when my best friend brought the video over and said ""you'll love this movie!"" DUH! Since that fateful night, I've watched this film dozens of times, and it's become one of my all-time favorites.
Now, first off, let's comment on how ground-breaking this film was when released. It was Disney's first foray into computer-animated film, and an undeniable gamble. With a strictly first-class voice cast (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, etc.,) Disney could have wound up very red-faced if it flopped. With dialogue this well-written, animation this well-executed, voice acting this inspired, there was no way it could lose.
The basic gist of the film is this: Woody(Hanks), is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. All is well in the world until Andy gets a new toy for his birthday, a Buzz Lightyear(Allen) doll, who doesn't realize he's a toy. Woody gets supremely jealous, then tries to off(!) Buzz, only to have to try to save him when the rest of the toys realize what happened. They form an alliance just get back to Andy's house before the family moves to a new home. During the ensuing adventures, Woody realizes he's at fault, Buzz realizes that he's a toy, and that they are becoming great friends. Oh yeah, and they get back to Andy, too.
There's a great feeling to this film, that of friendship, that pervades it to the end. There's an almost tangible feeling of heart to this film, and that is what makes it great. The transfer to DVD has left the film sparkling like a diamond, with crisp colr and defining contrasts. The sound is all you could want in a DVD release, also, and the really wonderful thing is the entire family will enjoy it and laugh and possibly cry some, too. What more could you want?",1016582400,2,1827,4.590214067278287
1167854,5,7883704559,"Toy Story, released in 1995, enters the world of toys when their owners aren't around.  It centers on Woody, a cowboy, who is Andy's favorite toy.  But when Andy gets Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger, Woody's place is jeopardized.  Woody has to deal with his feelings of jealousy, especially when he and the delusional Buzz become lost toys.
Toy Story 2 followed 4 years later and is the rare sequel that is at least as good as the original, if not better.  This time, an evil toy collector has kidnapped Woody, and his head swells when he finds out how valuable he really is.  Can Buzz and the other toys find him before he decides he doesn't want to return to Andy?
Toy Story will forever have a place in cinema history as the first completely computer animated movie.  But Pixar did a great job making sure it's a movie people will enjoy seeing years from now.  The toys are sympathetic characters and the story is wonderful.  The site gags and animation make it a treat for adults as well.
Toy Story 2 works as well as it does because it builds on the base of the first movie to tell a second story.  Pixar introduced new characters and a fresh story idea while still letting us see and enjoy to characters we loved from the first movie.  And the animation has only gotten better over time.  Yet the animation is there to tell a story, and the story telling and humor never lag.
The Ultimate Toy Box is a must for collectors or anyone interested in the animation process.  Not only are the two movies showcased well on their respective discs, but the extras are phenomenal.  I have spent hours going through the third disc soaking up information and trivia.  The features commentaries on the first two discs are a fascinating look into what really goes into making these movies.  I learned so much from them alone.
The two Toy Story movies will long be remember for being great films.  Any film collector owes it to himself or herself to have both in their collection.  And if you want to learn the most about these two movies, the people behind them, and what it took to make them, buy the Ultimate Toy Box.  You will be entertained and educated for hours.",1014595200,2,2159,4.464285714285714
1167855,5,7883704559,"""Toy Story"" is a modern fairy tale created with appropriately modern computer animation. Its snappy dialougue will appeal to adult viewers, the spectacle of fantastic toys coming to life will appeal to children, and adults may wax nostalgic about the toys they enjoyed as children, several of which are featured in this movie.
 The story revolves around a cowboy doll named Woody, and his imminent replacement as the favorite toy of his owner, Andy, by Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll, a multigadgeted gift that Andy receives for his birthday.
 Tom Hanks'personality shines through in the persona of Woody, and Tim Allen's voice lends the right amount of charisma to Buzz.
 In the process of forming an eventual friendship, the characters go through a lot of antagonism and a lot of other real human emotions. As they prepare for life in a new home, they are imperiled by the sadistic kid next door named Sid, into whose clutches they fall by accident.
 It's entertaining to watch the toys interact with each other.
 Buzz gradually learns that he is simply a child's plaything and not the noble space crusader he fancied himself to be in the beginning, and Woody learns to share his special place in Andy's heart. A great supporting cast including Annie Potts as Woody's sweetheart, Bo Peep, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as Slinky, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenburger as Ham, and Laurie Metcalfe as Andy's mother help fuel this tale.
 Seeing this innovative film made me want to buy dolls of Woody and Buzz as collector's items. But I am content with just a copy of this movie. The second installment of the ""Toy Story"" saga is an enhancement of the first one, and just like the first, nothing short of delightful.",1011916800,,1731,4.791946308724833

It's quite a lively approach to reuniting the older generation, with something that was long forgotten, with the younger generation to what being a kid was all about.  With toys like Woody, Mr. Potato Head, and Etch-a-sketch seen in this animated fashion it's a film nobody can miss!

Pixar effectively chose two wonderful actors for the voices of the main characters, Woody, an old-fashioned cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, a high-tech space invader.

I was very happy to see that the same care and attention to story was put into the sequel.  And I was overjoyed at how great this DVD set is.
Like any good special edition of an animated film, this DVD has piles of artwork of everything from Woody's origins as a ventriloquist's dummy to the anthropomorphic female cactus that became Jessie to the layout of Andy's room to the toys on the shelves at Al's Toy Barn.  The original plot of the first movie is available for reading.  Storyboards run alongside completed scenes or outline abandoned concepts.  One particularly odd feature lets you look at a few rendering glitches which result in characters' body parts being switched or misplaced, giving lie to the idea that having an animated film ""done with computers"" makes things significantly easier.  The commentary alone is worth the price of this whole set.  The head honchos of Pixar talk about their film with an enthusiasm which shows the time and care that went into their making.
I can pretty honestly reccomend this DVD to just about anyone.  There's so much stuff supporting these two great films that you're bound to find something you like.  Probably a whole lot of somethings.",1003017600,5,1351,4.686440677966102

Although Disney's sequels have the tendency to be really bad, this is not the case with Toy Story 2.  The movie continues the storyline beautifully and adds to the legacy of Woody and Buzz.

Aside from being entertaining which I say is superb as both films manage to hold my 2-yr. old toddler's short-spanned attention till the end, these convey messages or lessons to be learned -- not only for the young ones but the 'young once' as well.
These animations are full of emotions that even toddlers can define & appreciate. The lovely, lively, animated characters of Woody, Buzz, et al open our eyes to the concept of love, friendship, loyalty, gratitude & caring (for one's possession).  There are also the ideas on sadness, abandonment,sense of rejection which made my toddler wail till the ""sad"" songs were over.

The animation is so smooth and colorful that watching both ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" are pure eye candy.

These dvd's are loaded with not only the movies, but outtakes, more info, and even other shorts by Pixar which helped pave the way for these movies. The hardest thing to do is get the Pixar shorts. Pixar even went out of their way to explain why they have the lamp in the logo with their first animation, Luxo Jr.. Tin Toy is included in Toy Story and you can see where the idea of Toy Story came from. Keep in mind, this was when they were still nobodies, so the baby looks a little weird. If you look closely though in Toy Story 2 when the piggy bank flips through the channels real quick, Tin Toy and half of Pixars animation including the hula-girl for the levi's comerical show up. It's real quick though. In fact you need to keep a look out in all Pixar movies, like Jerry(from another short) showing up in TS2. So enough about the finer points, a quick word on TS1 and TS2.  TS1- A story about an old toy verses a new and the friendship that follows. This movie broke all the molds. It was well written, and for the first full length feature CG, this is a must have.  TS2- Breaking the mold again by make a sequal to an animation better than the first. Jesse is a personal favorite, and who better than Joan Cussak as the voice. Pixar set out to make their people look better and had fun with fur and dust, which got added in at the last second. Disney had originally wanted this one to be straight to video, much like  the Buzz lightyear traditonal, but Pixar would not have it any other way. The outtakes are not at the end of the movie, but rather can be acessed by the extras. What about the outtakes for TS1? I didn't forget them, they weren't made. The whole idea of outtakes started with A Bug's Life which came out after TS1 but before TS2.  Over all review is definatley to get this package.

1167971,5,7883704559,"note: This is a continuation of my previous review.
After seeing TOY STORY in the theaters, and A BUGS LIFE in astonishing detail on it's first DVD release, I knew going into the theaters that TOY STORY 2 would be a wonderful experience. I looked forward to seeing what amazing visuals John Lasseter and his Pixar crew would conjure up. They delivered. The opening sequence alone was a complete surprise. I won't spoil it by describing it here. I will say that it was a thrilling sequence when I saw it on the big screen. And on this DVD, it is colorful and in splendid detail along with the rest of it.
But there is a sequence that demonstrates the magic and power behind this wonderful film. WARNING: IF YOU NEVER SAW THE FILM, READ NO FURTHER. It is the part where the cowgirl Jesse tells Woody the story about when she had an owner just like he did. It is played to a special nominated song by Randy Newman. When I saw it in the theaters, something happened that I never experienced before. The entire audience in the theater during this song was....completely silent. Nobody cried, not even the infants and toddlers in the crowd...Nobody whispered to anybody. There wasn't a single sound in the place. And that silence lasted right until the film cut to the other toys in another room. I have never seen anything like that in a theater, even when I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" the year before. Although most of the crowd was quiet during that film, I still heard a cough, and I heard some people crying in the theater. Somebody had to be in tears during that song in TOY STORY 2, but they sure knew how to keep from making a sound. This is the kind of power this film had.
Another thing I noticed was the number of in-jokes Pixar put into this movie. I counted ""Jurassic Park"", ""Star Wars"", ""Superman"", and Pixar's earlier short films. These jokes were funny in the way they poked fun at those famous movies. If there were any more I missed them, but the supplement disc in this DVD package has a guide to those in-jokes. Pixar had such a big success with their deliberate outtakes at the end of ""A Bug's Life"" that they continued the tradition for TOY STORY 2. And these outtakes are even funnier. The TOY STORY 2 DVD also includes a splendid commentary by John Lasseter and his primary crew members just like the TOY STORY disk. And it contains another THX trailer starring Tex the robot. (see my earlier review for more details on that) This trailer is designed for owners of the newer THX Surround EX systems: a 6.1 channel surround setup with the 6th channel between the left and right rear. It's also an exclusive on this 3 disk DVD collection. It also plays extremely well on my 5.1 channel system as well. Bass sounds are deep and loud, and the surround effect has been carefully put together.
The supplement disk has so much material on it that I can't even begin to describe it in real detail. It includes early story treatments, development of characters both in story and design, song demos, and a breakdown of the stages in Pixar's computer animation process. It also has an explanation of why John Lasseter decided to do TOY STORY 2. It took me and a friend two nights (with very little free time available) to look at the material covering TOY STORY alone.
If you love the DVD format and have a 5.1 Channel surround system (or are lucky enough to have the new THX Surround EX 6.1 format) you are definitely going to want this one. I know it won't be available forever.",990144000,,3486,4.474097331240189

Both movies contain amazing CGI characters that are brought to life by actors such as Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz).  These movies are fun for all the family and are highly recommended.
The DVDs for the movies themselves are nothing short of spectacular.  The straight to digital transfers really shine and are anamorphic in their original widescreen aspect ratio.  The sound for both films is very impressive and makes great use of all the surround channels.  The opening of Toy Story 2 for example is great for showing off your Home Theater system.
The supplemental material is where this DVD set really shines.  If anyone was slightly interested in seeing how they made these amazing movies then the third disc is full of entertaining information.  Each movie gets its own supplemental section with tons of information on how the story developed and how the animation was done.  To music videos and clips of the actors speaking about their favourite characters.  There is just so much on this third disc!  Lastly a mention must go to the two very entertaining audio commentaries (one for Toy Story and another for Toy Story 2).

Whenever there were occasions where Andy would certainly receive presents, these toys would send out representatives (the green toy soldiers-whom the other toys regarded as ""professinals"" for missions of such) with a toy walkie talkie (a wee bit too huge for these mini soldiers), to find out what kind of toys Andy receive.  On Andy's birthday party, a toy spaceman (Buzz) was given to Andy. Since the arrival of Buzz, Woody's (a toy cowboy)position as Andy's favorite toy was threatened.
One day, Woody planned to get rid of Buzz. He managed to send Buzz flying out of Andy's bedroom window. When Andy couldn't find Buzz to accompany him in the car-trip, so he picked up Woody instead. In the bushes near the car where Buzz had fallen into frm Andy's window, Buzz spied Woody being taken into the car by Andy. He followed. The two toys ended up fighting at the bottom of the car when the family stopped at a petrol station. They were so emgrossed in squabbling that they did not realised that the car was getting to leave until it was too late.
There began their adventure of finding their way back home to Andy. They two rivals had to work together and plan a safe journey back.

However, Pixar did a terrific job on both of these movies.  The animation and general picture quality on these disks are probably the best I've seen on DVD yet.  The sound, THX qualified by the way, is superb as well.  However, I'm still kicking myself for getting the Toy Story 2 Pack instead of the Ultimate Toy Box (the 3 disk set).  I thought at the time that I would go the cheaper route and get the 2 disk set.  But, with the exception of a short 5 minute film on each disk there are NO EXTRAS on these disks.  Since I bought these disks I've read about the bountiful extras that are entertaining and inciteful that come with the Ultimate Toy Box.  In my opinion, this is downright unjust that Disney released such a barebones copy of these excellent movies.  I still regret that I bought the wrong version, so if a prospective buyer wants the extra stuff, take my advise and buy the better set.

1168016,5,7883704559,"Enough superlatives have already been aimed at the first movie, so I'm only going to address the second movie and the extras on the 2-disk set.
Toy Story 2 is a really good movie which explains to me exactly why it's a Good Thing that inanimate objects are not conscious.  It's a -very- positive movie about loyalty and persistance, with some interesting plot twists.
What really threw me is that each disk has a Tiny Toy Story on it.  The first disk has ""Tin Toy"" with its first publicly shown attempt at rendering a human baby by CGI (I really think this baby grew up to be Sid.  Hm, 1988 to 1995?  Could be.  Maybe that's why they put this Story here).  The second disk contains the definitive Story, ""Luxo Jr."".
While somewhat disappointed that the rest of the Stories weren't on either the 2 or the 3 disk set, as far as I know, these selections are perfectly good.  ""Luxo Jr."" is an amazing little story, as well as an Academy Award nominee and a technical advance for its debut year of 1986 when it was presented at the ACM SIGCHI/SIGGraph convention.
Still, when do we get Red's Dream (1987), and ""KnickKnack"" (1989) with the cool sound track, on DVD?  I'd buy that.  The VHS versions are, well... VHS.  What else to say?  Also, it'd be nice to see the post-Toy Story chess one.  Feel free to leave ""The Adventures of Andr&eacute; & Wally B."" off, though.  :-)",980640000,,1368,4.445783132530121

Using the ability to change and move in a world free of physical restraints, these two animations do an excellent job of creating a unique and hillarious story line that revolves around friendship and the pondering question of whether toys have control over their own actions.  With the voices of Tom Hanks (Big, Sleepless in Seattle, Saving Private Ryan) and Tim Allen (Home Improvement, Santa Clause) adding an air of liveliness that doesn't seem possible for men their ages.  They both prove that they are still children at heart as they liven the screen with their vibrant and cheerful voices.
Toy Story & Toy Story are based around the meaning of friendship and the journeys that they will go through just to help one.  Both are excellent videos for children and adults and will have you laughing when necessary.
The DVDs are crisp and clean, better than watching it at the theatre even, and have some Special Features, which aren't necessary because the movies are worth it by themselves, that will have you laughing even more and wonder what the graphic artists and writers do in their free time.",980294400,5,1284,4.774774774774775
1168029,5,7883704559,"An visual ode to the power and wonder of youth, the Toy Story set represents the apex of the Disney genre.  From the genuine magic of the orignal Toy Story to the pop culture pathos of Toy Story 2 to the man-behind-the-curtain tour of supplemental disc, The Ultimate Toy Box will disappoint no fan of affecting filmmaking.  These are the films Walt Disney himself would have made.
The Ultimate Toy Box is firmly anchored by the original Toy Story--a tale of unlikely friendship, self-discovery, and amazing toys that come to life.  Woody the cowboy doll (voiced, in another terrific performance, by Tom Hanks) is the favored toy in Andy's room until the hi-tech Buzz ightyear (Tim Allen) crash-lands on Woody's spot on the bed. While Andy's other toys hang on Buzz's every word, Woody resents the attention given the Space Ranger.  But when he and Buzz are trapped in the home of the evil toy-torturing neighbor Sid, Woody finds many of his views contradicted. Woody's plea for help from Sid's ""cannibal"" toys is the film's climax:  ""Please.  He's my friend,"" says Woody of Buzz.  One of the best car chases in movie history closes the movie.
Toy Story 2 is the Godfather II of animated movies--a sequel that can stand next to the original. This is particularly pleasing after the direct-to-video debacles that are most Disney sequels.  While not as magical as the orginal, Toy Story 2 succeeds in its own way, combinging more complex CG effects with tongue-in-cheek subtext.
Finally, the supplemental disc provides a basckstage pass to the whole enterprise, from design to voicing to rendering, to even a set of ""outtakes"" from the films.  Few films genuinely REQUIRE 480 resolution lines to enjoy them. Toy Story has to be viewed on DVD--VHS does it no justice. The Anamorphic Widescreen format is a vision on a 16x9 screen--I recommend no other screen format. You cannot own a DVD player and not have this set.  It's really that simple.",980121600,,1939,4.848484848484849

If you are fortunate enough to own a Surround Sound system in your home you'll notice a difference as well with the THX optimode featured on these DVD versions.  I've seen TS on VHS on my THX system and it was decent.  But with the DVD's THX optimode you truly go back to the theater.  The ""action"" scenes are much better as the sounds move from channel to channel, especially in large scale scenes with the rocket and airport.  They're a thousand times more crisp than the VHS version.  The third DVD is a nice bonus, too, with an entertaining interactive menu full of content to keep you busy for hours.

I have to say that I will find any excuse to watch these films again and again; they bridge generations in that adults and children can immerse themselves with equal enjoyment.  The collectors set is the best for extras that has come on any DVD so far, but this should be no surprise as John Lasseter and Co. have been working in the digital medium for way to many years to disappoint on that front, it would be hard to imagine that there will be much to beat this for a while.  The films themselves have a cast that is amazing and you have to sometimes remind yourself that the characters are not 'real' (You are a toy, T O Y as Woody informs Buzz)  By the way, there is a must see `Easter egg' on one of these disks....",975888000,,843,4.185185185185185

Tom Hanks & Tim Allen lend their voices to create two memorable characters in Woody and Buzz.  I'm an adult but these two films so easily bring out the kid in me.  So many films say ""for kids of all ages"".  This one truly delivers.  Also, the sequel (Toy Story 2) is every bit as clever as the first one.  The storyline continues and explores new territory for the toys' adventure; it doesn't simply re-hash the original's plot line.

The older disney movies were better written and have real depth to the character development. When Walt Disney ran the company, movies could address scary things, like life, death, politics, ecology and social issues. Disney no longer desires to make great movies. Nor does it know how anymore. Disney needs to kick out all the execs and hire a new team that is willing to make a gamble and strive to create stories and not block busters. The last couple of years, disney movies have been brain drains that lack real substance and is deathly afraid of breaking the disney formula.

1168144,5,7883704559,"This is an excellent box set to have with both of the loveable Toy Story movies and the third disc which provides vast amount of information about how the concepts evolved for both movies.
  ""Toy Story"" is an incredible tale which explores the thought of what your toys really did when you weren't looking.  There are many loveable characters such as Woody and Buzz Lightyear.  Woody was Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear was given to Andy as a birthday present.  This story takes you on an adventure with Woody, Buzz and many other toys that everyone remembers having as kids as they fight together in the end and become buddies.  This movie has many funny moments which adults and children alike will appreciate.  It is such an amazing piece of art and creativity that you want to watch it over and over again and keep noticing more and more each time.  If you loved the first movie and you thought that it couldn't be topped, there is ""Toy Story 2"".  I actually liked this movie even better than the first.  Woody mistakenly ends up in a box to be sold at a yard sale and is bought by a toy collector.  You get to meet Jessie the cowgirl, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the prospector and learn more about Woody's background.  And of course, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head and the rest of the toys go on an adventure to find and save Woody.  This movie was hilarious and managed to tug at the heartstrings at the same time.
  The third CD in the set, takes you on a tour by John Lasseter and other members of the creative team through the entire experience of developing these two wonderful movies. From the history, story ideas, designs, music and sound and deleted animation one gains a greater appreciation for what it took to make these movies reality.  This DVD is set up that you choose your path through all of the categories and subcategories.  Many of these areas are basically screens of text that you have to read, so they may be beyond the reading level of some little ones.  But it is definately worth surfing through.
  Overall this is a great box set and I would purchase it for adults and children alike.",974592000,4,2125,4.484375
1168145,5,7883704559,"Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are among the classics of animation!  It's lots of fun to sit back, watch Toy Story and then follow it up with Toy Story 2, which is just as vibrant, funny, and heartwarming as the first one.  Toy Story 2 concerns itself with what happens when Woody is abducted by an evil, money-grubbing toy collector.  Without making it into a lecture, the movie points out the ugly greed of toy collecting for profit, not fun.  The movie gently asserts that toys are for us to play with and to enjoy, not to be stuffed on to a shelf to gather dust.  It'll break your heart when you see Wheezy included among the yard sale items; you'll want to rescue him yourself.  TS 2 introduces a funny, non-enlightened version of Buzz, and the real Buzz thinks out loud, ""Was I ever this deluded?""  Turns out that the 2nd Buzz is necessary to the story, even though he's a pompous Space Ranger.
TS 2 also includes some special touches that carry over from TS.  The Pizza Planet delivery truck makes an appearance in TS2, and the results are hilarious when the toys attempt to drive. At one point, the toys must cross the street to get to Al'S Toy Barn, and they do this by hiding under orange road cones, with hilarious/disastrous results -- it reminds you of how Woody and Buzz sneaked into Pizza Planet in TS.  It's little touches like these that really illustrate how much they tried to make TS2 feel like the original.
The extras on the DVD are great, especially the outtakes reel.  There's previews for upcoming releases, one of which is ""Monsters, Inc.""  The whole set is definitely worth the money and would make an awesome gift for any TS fan!",974160000,5,1652,4.45514950166113

Story I features Tom Hank's character, Woody, coming to terms with not being Andy's favorite toy anymore when a new toy (enter Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear) comes into the picture. Minimal singing and lots of hillarious lines make this a great movie for all ages.  Story II features Woody being, well, toynapped. Buzz and the gang embark on adventure to gain the Woody one back. My only qualm with this movie is that there are two songs (I REALLY don't like singing in movies, but that's just me) in it. However, the writers seem to have realized that there are people of all ages watching this movie, so keep your eyes and ears open for more ""mature"" jokes.",974073600,,803,4.537931034482758

1168148,5,7883704559,"Great Bargain!  Two of the most wonderful animated films of all time packaged together for the price of one! TS1 is already groundbreaking for the seamless computer animation and family-friendly fare, but TS2 manages to do it one better.  The in-jokes are funnier, the animation is smoother, the storyline more compelling, and the ""outtakes"" at the end provide the biggest laughs.  My favorite part of this movie, however, has to be Sarah McLachlan's vocals on the song Randy Newman wrote for this film, ""When She Loved Me.""  It is a bittersweet love song written through the eyes of a toy doll, and it is a heartwrencher.  Justly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song last year, it inexplicably lost to another Disney-movie song, a schmaltz-filled snoozer by Phil Collins.  But I digress...
The digital video of DVD presents the splendid computer animation of the TS films in all its crispness.  They even look darn near 3D played on a DVD-ROM.
Of particular interest as a bonus ---  a teaser for MONSTERS, INC., another computer animation feature coming in 2001.  The delightully funny trailer features the voices of John Goodman and Billy Crystal, and also includes Danny Elfman's score from MIDNIGHT RUN as the temporary music track.

1168149,5,7883704559,"I remember watching Toy Story at the movies and being amazed at the quality of the graphics and the sheer brilliance of the story. Then along came A Bugs Life which took computer-animation to the next level. I held my breath when Toy Story 2 came along - surely it would go the way of most sequels ...
I had forgotten how much I loved it at the cinema but had this horrible feeling that it seemed to have been more of an adult movie than for kids. Well I guess I just underestimated it. My kids (6 and 7) were glued to it (as was I). The movie references were great for me and the action was great for my kids. And to top it all, another great Disney message about toys, belonging and growing up.
This movie is oustanding and I get three DVDs (ok I have Toy Story on video but it is wearing out - that's my story)! These Pixar guys must be pumped up on creativity. How else do you explain two Buzz's, the best way to cross a street I have ever seen and some great outtakes. And now Barbie gets in on the act (well done Mattel - hope you sacked your foresight person after Toy Story).
Do I need to tell you the story? I hope not. Do I need to tell you to buy this, cherish it, put it somewhere safe so no-one can damage it? NO.

I won't spend time on the movies themselves, except to say that they're two of the most entertaining films ever made.  Instead, let's focus on why to get the 3-DVD set instead of the 2-DVD set.
The third DVD is truly impressive.  You'll find fully-animated deleted scenes; funny & interesting interviews with cast, crew, animators, etc.; an absolutly hysterical debate on ""Who's the best character?"" with Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and the whole cast; some very detailed explanations of the techniques used to create the movies; and so much more.  I've spent over three hours on Disc 3 alone so far, and there's a lot more to go!
There are even cool hidden features.  For example, on Disc 3 choose 'Toy Story 2.' Under the 'Story' section, choose 'Jesse's Song.' On the next screen that appears, press the 'Left' arrow key on your remote control & you'll see a question mark. With the question mark highlighted, hit 'Enter' for a outtake with an introduction by the directors.
The sound & picture quality on all three discs are the best I've seen on DVD.  Helps when the whole movie was CREATED digitally, eh?  :)
All in all ""The Ultimate Toy Box"" is the best DVD set around, bar none.  Well worth the extra money!",973468800,74,1423,4.5234375
1168151,5,7883704559,"""Toy Story"" was a great innovation in cinema animation. ""Toy Story 2"" continues that innovation and goes beyond. To be successful an animated film should not only deliver images that complement the story, but the story itself should have inherent qualities that enhance our own lives and those of our family. ""Toy Story 2"" achieves that and in the original ""Toy Story"" we see the creative processes coming together. This is one of the best family packages from Disney.

The 2 movies (contained on the 1st and 2nd disc) are superb and have good supplemental fillers themselves, such as the ""Making of Toy Story"" The 3rd disc contains additional supplemental material which is great for people who are heavily into the technical stuff.  However, be forewarned: accessing the many features on disc 3 is a remote controller's nightmare. The material is broken into so many brief sub-segments that I was required to constantly click my remote control to access the features. To add to the frustration, there are these huge pauses that occur each time the DVD searches for a chapter. It really diminished my enjoyment of disc 3. In my opinion, it would have made more sense to have included some ""play all"" options that would have given the viewer the choice between uninterrupted viewing and single chapter selection. Better have some spare remote control batteries on hand. Enjoy.",973296000,,947,4.91875
1168153,5,7883704559,"Great movies to say the least. Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are great computer generated animation backed up with great buddy stories that you will love as much as your children. Whereas Toy Story revolves around Woody's concern over Andy's affection for buzz, Toy Story 2 deals with Woody being kidnapped by a vintage toy collector and the other toys attempt to rescue him. Toy Story 2 also introduces us to some great new characters including Jessie, Bullseye, and even Mrs. Potatoe Head.
What the Toy Box set offers is everything a diehard Toy Story and  DVD fan could want. It is loaded with cut scenes, production notes, interviews with cast and crew and so much more. There is also a great section of joke references and hidden gags, many which center around Bug's Life. The third disc in this set has hours of great extras.
Finally, what may be lost on some is the fact that these movies were made for the digital experience that DVD offers. You get great surround effect from your speaker package. The video is SO much clearer when viewed on DVD. You WILL notice the difference.
Overall, two great movies with a ton of extras. Films that were made for DVD and a lot of extras for your extra money. Buy this boxed set for your kids and YOU. Enjoy.",973209600,2,1251,4.511013215859031
1168193,5,7883704559,"I am a Toy Story lover for many reasons. I love high quality animation, and used to go to animation festivals all the time to watch the craft grow and mature. To see the amazing results of the first-ever true full length movie done solely by computer, and to have its means of creation pale to its incredible storyline, character depth, and general quality of production, is something not often seen in today's motion picture industry.
These two movies (Toy Story 1 and 2) are great for kids. You have themes children can easily relate to - jealousy, losing something you love dearly, dealing with friends, apologizing and making up when you have been mean to someone, you name it. Where a sequel is usually worse than the original, Toy Story 2 again breaks the mold by coming through with a fantastic storyline, as Woody is stolen by a selfish toy collector who wants to sell him for a fortune, to be trapped in a museum forever.
For adults, the series shines as well. The wealth of in-jokes is simply phenomonal. There are references to Star Wars, to old westerns, to literature, you name it. A whole book could be done on the ways in which these movies appeals to the older movie watcher.
The voice actors are all well known - Don Rickles, Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, etc. etc. - and they do a stellar job. You really become attached to these toys, which are very dimensional and believable. You understand their failings and applaud their triumphs.
Just getting the two movies on DVD might be enough - but then they made a THIRD DVD which is stuffed full of amazing extras!! How about a guide to the hidden jokes? Reviews of each character, each character's actor, and sketches and history of how they changed over time?
The DVD explains with great video clips how a storyboard is made, how the sound is mixed, how the animation is done, and they even have special features where you can mix the sound YOURSELF to see how effect noises and music affect the movie. Plus SO much more.
I would pay more than the movie DVD cost to get this extra DVD, because it is a superb way for both adults and children to learn a wealth of information about making movies and how things are done. Who knows, after watching the special DVD, your kids might suddenly decide to become a sound magician, or a lighting expert, because they see how these roles can have a huge impact on a film like this.
I highly recommend that every household with a DVD get your hands on this three-pack, and if you don't have a DVD player, this is the perfect reason to get it. Even if you have the video copy, give that away to your local library and buy this. It is priceless.",973123200,17,2641,4.458677685950414

I favor Toy Story 2 because the story line deals with personal fullfillment,  where as the first installment has more of a survival and favoritism angle.  This DVD has such high resolution detail and clarity ( Even on a regular tv).  The best way is in a HDTV (High Definition TV) home threatre environment.  Then it becomes unbeliveable.

Then there's the Dolby Digital soundtrack. Set your DVD player for 5.1 playback, turn on the Home Theatre system and just wait! Since it's animated, sound effects and music fly every which way! It's a great experience, almost as good as being in a theatre.
With this DVD set, you also get outtake shorts, which were first introduced in Disney's ""A Bug's Life.""
Of course, since the movie was created digitally, it's impossible to have ""real"" outtakes (which in the movie business are scenes cut from a film because of some technical problem such as actors flubbing lines or being out of place on the set), so these new ""scenes"" were created just for the lucky DVD buyers! Some of them are really funny!
There's also commentary and details of how the movie was created, animation behind-the-scenes clips, and a great preview of Disney's next Pixar-produced feature, Monsters, Inc. It's so real, it's scary!

My girlfriend's smile grew bigger every minute and we loved eachother more after watching Toy Story. Toy Story 2 is even better then part 1 (especially the movements and facial expressions of the characters are amazing). Randy Newman did a great job writing the music score (I suspect him to be a Disney character himself). The extra's on disc 3 are fun.

Beyond that, it was a great movie. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were the perfect choices to voice Sheriff Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively. And, it was a huge hit. A sequel became a fiscal responsibility.
The original plan had ""Toy Story 2"" as being a direct-to-video sequel. Then Tom and Tim convinced Michael Eisner that the sequel was good enough to go to theaters. They were right.
While not the awe-inspiring vision of the original, the characters carry this one to new heights. The site gags are brilliant. And, the newer characters help freshen it up. Plus, the Buzz vs. Buzz scene is a real treat.

1168199,2,7883704559,". . . the rest of us, however, may view this film more calmly.  *Toy Story 2*  dares to breach some pretty heavy themes, such as mortality, the transience of love, decay, among others.  For youngsters, the resolution of these themes will be comforting; to adults, it will all be too pat  (or should be!)  at the end.  In other words, don't bring up the grim stuff if you're not going to follow through.  Having Woody say  (and I'm paraphrasing), ""I'll take the boy's love and affection for as long as it lasts""  ranks up there with  *Love Story*'s  ""Love means never having to say you're sorry"" -- in other words, puerile . . . for ALL ages.
Also, I found the animation distracting.  It certainly shows an advance on the first film . . . but to what end?  I realize this is probably a personal thing, but I spent far too much time during this movie trying to figure out what was  ""traced"", computerized, or inked.  It looked totally real . . . then it started looking like that old Dire Straits video  (*Money for Nothing*).  I guess I'm just not going to warm up to computer animation . . . and I'm betting ole Walt would feel the same.",972864000,2,1137,4.287735849056604
1168200,5,7883704559,"Another must to have in anyone's collection.  The commentaries for both films are very good. The makers of the film point out inside jokes and other aspects of the animation and story. The first documentary is very good. The second documentary isn't as good as it is almost a repeat of the first. The supplemental disc mainly was a lot of text information on every aspect of making both Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  Although this information is informative, it gets boring quickly in my opinion. The outtakes for the second film are very funny. Just like the animation characters were real actors on a set. The outtakes for the first film are mainly computer animation errors that aren't that interesting. I especially enjoyed the CBS Children's Hour spots that were included. I think over 50 10-15 second spots are included. Concept animation such as Tin Soldier, Luxo Jr. and some beta Toy Story animation are included too. Included in the supplemental disc are some deleted scenes that are mainly shorten scenes that are still in the original stories. Overall this set is worthy for just the stories alone. The extra features make this an essential DVD set.",972777600,,1159,4.819095477386934
1168201,5,7883704559,"If you liked, or even loved the ""Toy Story"" movies the two disc set is probably the thing for you. However, if you're the kind of person who likes to know how the whole thing is put together, a film student say, or just an overly curious viewer, this is the one to have.
Both films come with audio commentary, Acamdemy Award winning and nominated short films, French language tracks, and are THX certified. ""Toy Story"" also includes a multi language reel (where Buzz and Woody's first encounter with each other is shown in some of the many languages the film was translated in),a making of featurette, & on set interviews with Woody & Buzz. But the best thing on this disc is the 'Toy Story treats', which are about 51 short almost commercials that Pixar created for ABC's Saturday morning cartoons to help promote the movie. They're nothing more than ten second blips with all the characters from the first film, and this is the first place you can see them all together. Really cool!
The ""TS2"" disc includes the hilarious outtakes that were put in the film after its' initial release, and a rather dull and drawn out sneak preview of Pixar's next feature, ""Monsters, Inc.""
But the real reason to spend the extra bucks is for the third disc. Every aspect of both films is covered from pre-production to publicity. Extensive interviews with the directors of the films include conversations about why they chose to do a sequel, as well as discussing traditional elements of the film making process. The art department of both films discuss specific locations, and both have original song demos from Randy Newman. There's also a great bit where they show you all the inside jokes the animators put into the second film. Even the menu screens for each of the sections is painstakingly thought out.
In the liner notes John Lasseter,(The Director), says the set is ""fun, it's entertaining, it's even scholarly. But most of all this DVD is a tribute to the geniuses I get to work with every day. Warm up your remotes, remember where your 'angle' button is-and get ready to ride!""

He doesn't want Barney or anything else on TV but Toy Story. He prefers Toy Story 2. Now, I am finally getting tired watch too much of it EACH and everyday.
<the following is my original review>
Wow, what quality you can get with 500 line resolution. After I saw this DVD I was wondering how much better can a High Definition DVD can be? I am sure it can't be any better than this!! If it can, I wouldn't notice it. I enjoyed watching it. A great way to start Disney collection. Can't wait for the Bug's Life DVD to get cheaper.",972345600,,703,4.138686131386861

If you are at all interested in the way this animation works-the 3rd disc shows you!  If you want to hear music demos-you've got that too.  Simply put, everything you want and need to know is jammed packed into the convenience of a DVD.
You simply can't help but smile at the Toy story series.  The mix of adult-level humor with childlike joy make these movies for the ages.
You must have this!",972345600,4,547,4.484848484848484
1168245,5,7883704559,"I only buy great DVDs that really give me something extra for my money, and this is the best set I've bought yet, perhaps even the best set of DVDs ever made.  Great movies, the best possible conversion, and more extras than you could ever hope to explore - this is worthy of your time and money!
The Movies - If you missed one of both of these films, you've missed perhaps the best animated movies ever made.  I can't possibly describe these wonderfully detailed plots and characters, but I will tell you that both films contain adult themes of loss and growing old, and are deeply moving.  To see toys that we have all played with come to life - Mr Potato Head, Speak 'n Spell, Hot Wheels, Barbies, piggy banks, and one precious ""operation"" performed by little green plastic Army Men - this is pure movie magic.  Kids are not required to watch these movies!  Even granparents can relate. The original was the first completely computer-animated film, but it's effects are by no means primative - they are jaw-dropping.  The sequel is more satisfying and engrossing than the first.  There are actually moments in the sequel were the human beings look absolutely real.  Of course, because of their subject matter, any child is guaranteed to watch these movies over and over.
The DVDs - No other DVD can possibily match the visual conversion in this box set.  Because the original movies were made entirely with computers, the animators simply had the entire film recreated specifically for the DVD medium.  There are absolutely no scratches, no specks of dust, no artifacting, nothing wrong at all.  I would dare say that it is physically impossible for a movie shot on film to look this good on DVD.  The sound is wonderful as well, some of the best soundtracks in animation:  crisp, full sound fx combined with nostalgic music and hilarious acting by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and a cast of other familiar voices.
The Extras - Hours and hours of extras.  The directors and writers give you a guided tour of every aspect of both both films - the character design, the virtual sets, test shoots, deleted scenes, previews, old Pixar short films, even ""outakes"" and ""interviews"" with the animated characters themselves.  Wonderful stuff that will tell you more than you ever wanted to know!  It's worth it - get this box set!",972172800,9,2318,4.714640198511166
1168246,5,7883704559,"To be honest, as of writing this, I haven't watched the DVD movie by itself.  I have been watching the extras instead (and there are a log).  One of my favorite is the audio commentery option.  The people who made the movie(s) talk about the movie and the scenes that you are watching, and it often put a whole new perspective on that scene.  One part that I didn't like in TS2, was the Jessies song part.  But when it was explained by the producers, I was able to accept it more.
This is the edition for those who enjoy the behind the scenes look, the back stories, rejected stories that went into producing them.  We also learn about the philosophies of these people at Pixar, which seemed to be similar to my philosophy.  (perhaps that is why I love PIXAR movies over its Disney affliate).
If you are deciding to buy this version or the regular two CD Version, ask your self this question.  Do I just want to see the movie, or Do I want an in-depth examination on what went into this movie?  The ultimate toy box is the in depth review.
My one dissappointment was the Monster Inc preview.  Granted, it was enjoyable, but I hoped it would be a litte longer.",972172800,2,1159,4.324074074074074

The stories are suitable for all ages, not just the kids.  Adults will enjoy revisiting not only the toys they played with as children, but a joy that we all knew as children - making inanimate toys come to life.  This time, though, it's not imagination providing the action, it's the wizards at Pixar.
In addition to wonderful characters, characterizations, and great stories, the movies feature some of the best music Randy Newman has ever done.  If you don't get even a little bit misty during ""When She Loved Me,"" in Toy Story 2, it's time to seriously reacquaint yourself with the child within.
Finally, because it's DVD, you're copy will be jam-packed with all sorts of additional information, dialogue, and making-of features.  Watch the movies, and then play the ""outtakes.""  They are a hoot!

As if to tempt fate, they released Toy Story 2 in 1999, to greater and funnier claim. Now, they have set the standard for DVD releases with their release of the ""Ultimate Toy Box: Toy Story and Toy Story 2"".
I have spent at least three hours of my weekend browsing through the endless streams of information the folks at Pixar developed for us on this stunning release, and that is just on the supplmental disk. Not to mention the bevy of bonuses found on both movies, this release makes for an enjoyable time all around. With interviews, behind the scene vignettes, special effects, and outtakes, you will spend every minute entirely entertained with Woody and the gang.

Later on he finds it and Andy starts playing with the toys for 5 minutes imitating them and Andy accidentally rips Woody's right arm and because of that Woody can't go to camp.  Woody is shelved and has a dream that Andy comes home from camp early and throws him in the trash.  Then Woody is kidnapped and taken to Al's Toy Barn.  Woody is repaired and made as good as new after his arm fully falls off.  All the other toys start a search for Woody and later on they see many copies of Buzz, Woody, etc. and Tour Guide Barbie takes them on a tour.  Andy is surprised when all the toys come home and Woody's arm is fixed.  He has new toys.  Three Barbie dolls wearing magenta, green and cyan dance to the ""Wipeout"" song and another toy performs a new version of ""You've Got a Friend in Me.""

1168250,5,7883704559,"If you're thinking of getting the Toy Story movies on DVD, then spend the extra money and get the box set over the 2-disc set. You won't be sorry. The box itself is pretty amazing - with a silver background that has sketches of the characters, and a big plastic protective cover with the color versions of Woody and Buzz. The plastic slides over the main silver box where the individual DVD cases are stored, and matches the sketch drawings. Very slick.
The box set includes 3 DVDs: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and a special third DVD jam-packed with so many extras from both movies, that it took me 2 hours to get through it all! You'll be amazed at all the work that went into creating the two features. It's fun to look through stuff like early sketches of Woody, interview clips with the stars who provided the voices (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, etc), storyboards, trailers, publicity posters, outtakes, deleted scenes, and much much more. Did you know that the first draft for Toy Story was in 1991? Me either! Lots of little fun facts in there as well.
Pixar really takes DVD technology seriously, and it shows with The Ultimate Toy Story Box set. This has become my new ""show off"" DVD, which I use to demonstrate the power of DVD technology to friends who are still using VCRs.
I strongly recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of the Toy Story movies. The picture quality is wonderful. If you also love getting tons of extra features on DVD for your hard earned money, then you'll be in total heaven with this set.",972000000,8,1516,4.456834532374101

Colors are vibrant beyond belief and the picture is so sharp, it may crack your screen!  These DVD's  were produced DIRECTLY from Pixars digital masters, so the quality is unreal.  The sound quality is equally impressive.  Both the sound effects and the score roll off your speakers in full-blown sound quality and spacial characteristics that are very pleasant to the ear.  The 3rd disc which contains all supplemental material will keep you busy for hours!  You get to meet the directors, animators, editors, sound designers and a bunch of other happy folks at Pixar.  They talk to you about every process of the Toy Story developement.  They even get technical about their computer wizardry...(but not too technical for novices).  In conclusion, if you are a fan of what Pixar is doing, I HIGHLY recommend getting the ""The Ultimate Toy Box: 3 Disc Collector's Set.""  Impressive in every aspect...and the movies are wonderful to watch and enjoy!

1168281,5,7883704559,"If anyone still needs a reason to buy a DVD player, this is it.  Disney has produced one of the most astounding DVD box sets ever created, setting new standards for content and quality.  This is one to own!
To begin with, of course, there are the films:  Toy Story and Toy Story II.  Both are minor masterpieces, not only in terms of the revolutionary computer animation concepts, but in every other respect as well:  The scripts are fantastic, the comic timing impeccible, characterizations are marvelous, etc., etc., etc.  The only issue is trying to determine which of the two is the better film...they're really ""companion pieces"", like the Godfather I and II set.  While they are technically ""kid's movies"", I defy anyone to watch them without being thoroughly impressed, amused and entertained...and most amazing (and unusual for children's movies)of all, they really do keep getting better with repeated viewings...something parents of small children will certainly welcome.
As to the extra content...I have only scratched the surface of everything that's in here.  Suffice it to say that there are mountains of material in this package, which will provide endless hours of enjoyment for the fan.  One of the features I've noticed already is a ""Guide to Hidden Jokes"" which provides an absloutely hilarious map of the ""inside"" humor to be found all over these films.
The sound and picture of these films are excellent, of course...just what one would expect for a high-tech project such as this one.  But technical accomplishments are ultimately secondary in importance behind the quality of the stories.  That's where TOY STORY and TOY STORY II really stand out...above all the technology, they are simply wonderful movies!",971913600,,1731,5.124555160142349

The picture quality makes you feel like (to quote Entertainment Weekly) ""your retinas have been squeegeed"". It is astonishingly clear, with well-rendered, vivid colors and excellent shading. The sound (THX certified) is the best I have heard on DVD, and I own dozens of titles. Toy Story & Toy Story 2 will now be the benchmark I use to show off and fine tune my system.

The highlights for me so far have been the 50+ original pieces (bumpers) of animation Pixar did for ABC's Saturday morning cartoon shows and the early animation tests they did with the 'crude' Woody and Buzz.
The quality of the DVD transfer for both movies and most of extras are perfect. It is on par with ""A Bug's Life"".
Like ""A Bug's Life"" there is a lot of text to read like the first two treatments for Toy Story. Although they are fascinating to read, this type of 'extra' content is very tedious to read off a TV screen. I would of been nice if a web browsable version of this content was available on the DVD.

The ""Toy Story 2"" disc includes both the widescreen and standard versions of the film, a Pixar short entitled ""Luxo jr."" (which was Pixar's first film short and the reason for their bouncing lamp in their logo.), outtakes (which worked well in ""A bug's Life"" and work equally well here.) and finally, a sneak peak of Pixar's next film, ""Monsters Inc."", which, by the way, looks great.

1168289,5,7883704559,"Toy Story to me was one of the greatest 3D animated movies that I've ever seen. Not only that, but I believe it delivered a great message to all the  viewers. Well, at least if they did understand the concept and put it to  work. The movie had a great plot and also a well written quest for all the  characters to go through. The friendship that ""Andy"" and the toys  had was incredible...that's why I say that it delivered a great message.  Because for one thing, it demonstrated the bond between plastic or stuffed  toy and humankind. The way ""Andy"" made the toys feel with that  sence of belonging when he wrote his name in permanent ink to keep track  that they were all his. Not just that, but the contrast that the creators  made throughout the whole movie with the bad kid ""Sid"" and the  wanted by all parents ""Andy"". What parent wouldn't want a kid  like that? The creators gave it their all on this movie and they put forth  the best to make us laugh in every scene possible! Like the part where  ""Rex"", my favorite, tells the piggybank he came from Mattel. The  fact is, most toys do. From Playschool and even Fisherprice...and that's  just what the creators did, they made the best possible to bring it to real  life. Above all, in my opinion, since the movie did bring back a kid in me  as well as in many other people and adults, the movie brought out that even  if the materialistic made be made from plastic and any other kind of  material, the child and the toy will always have that special bond between  them; the most incredible thing is, they probably always will. I believe we  all should learn a bit from this too. Because in the end we all as humans  later on the future and the futures to come we will all need that sence of  attention and of belonging between each other.

For example the one in which ""Rex"" tells the pigybank that he  comes from Mattel after hearing ""Buzz"" saying he xcame from  ""somewhere in the galaxy..."". Truth is many toys do come from  Mattel, Fisherprice and Playschool. It was really great that the creators  of this movie could incorporate this in thre movie.  I believe the contrast  was great between ""Andy"" and ""Sid"" and I believe it  gave a great example to all kids and adults of the way to be abd the way  not to be. All in all I can truly sat this movie was really innocent and it  showed the unison and special bond that kids have between cute pieces of  stuffing and plastic. This movie is one of my favorites for the fact that  it gave me the chance to become a kid once again and because many of the  adults were there once. But I guess my biggest thing that I learned from  here is that I still believe that one day people will learn how to take  care of others as humankind in this movie has taken care of and has had a  great unison between plastic....",969148800,3,1222,4.216450216450217

Toy Story 2 Andy goes to summer camp and  the toys face a new crisis: Woody turns out to be a valuable collectible  and is kidnapped by an evil toy collector. It's up to Buzz and the gang to  save him.

""Toy Story"", the trailblazing computer-animated  original, scored with a witty script, great voice overs by Tom Hanks and  Tim Allen (EVERY voice is terrific, in fact), briskly handled action, and  even an existential question that kids and adults alike can wonder about:  what is a toy's existence?
""Toy Story 2"" continues with even  better animation, a clever storyline and terrific action (including a  dynamite space adventure/Darth Vader-style family revelation with Buzz  Lightyear's nemesis, Zorg).
The witty script pokes fun at obsessive  collectors, and even manages to give us MORE Woody existentialism without  boring the kids in the least.
And try to keep a dry eye through the  Sarah McLachlan song ""When She Loved Me."" I dare you. And any  film with Robert Goulet singing is aces with me.

This two-pack gives you what are quite simply the best movies to employ computer animation. Far from the cold, sterile creations  many thought they would be, the Toy Story movies bring forth a magical  world for all to play in. These movies bring us the adventures of Woody (an  old-fashioned cowboy doll), Buzz (a futuristic space ranger), and all the  other toys that inhabit young Andy's bedroom. The first movie introduces  these characters and brings us a whimsical tale in which Buzz must learn  that he is in fact a toy and not a true Space Ranger. Along the way  friendships are made and the evil ploys of a young neighborhood toy  mutilator must be thwarted. The second movie presents the lost toys from  Woody's old television show and a greedy toy collector that wants Woody for  his own. Both of these movies are quite superb. The first is a breathtaking  introduction into a world that adults will remember and children will love.  The animation is beautiful and also charming. The second movie takes the  characters and provides them with even more depth, while spinning them into  even more fun adventures.

1168391,5,7883704559,"When Walt Disney oversaw his production team in the early days, the thing he empasized most about his cartoon shorts and features were the gags.  He hammered into his people the need to squeeze as many gags as possible into  every frame, so that a viewer would hardly catch his breath from one  explosion of laughter before he is overcome by another.
Toy Story and Toy  Story II were both made decades after Walt had left his company to others;  yet - when you watch it - you get the sense that even after all these  years, the folks at Pixar and Walt Disney Studios remember how important it  is to make us laugh.  When you see these movies, you will giggle, you will  chortle, you will snicker and chuckle and cackle and roar.  When it's all  over, if your sides aren't splitting and you mouth isn't sore from the  constant grin, then you have a serious malfunction in the 'sense-of-humor'  section of your brain.
And it isn't just funny and touching and exciting  in the classic Disney sense - it's also chock full of subtle gags and  nostalgic toys.  Most young adults will immediately recognize the  supporting cast, from Mr. Potato Head, to the etch-a-sketch, to the Slinky  dog.  Tiny plastic green soldiers march in formation straight from our  imagination onto the screen.  And even Jaws, and Godzilla, and a barrel of  monkeys make their appearence.

The younger viewer will love the antics of Woody, Buzz and the rest  of the toys, whilst those of us a little older can get a little nostalgic  as we see some of the toys from our youth.

The animation has matured and the  non-plastic cast look and move a lot more naturally in comparison with the  original movie.

This collection is great!  The first moviefinally broke the computer animation barrier (and was very popular to boot).  The second (just as popular, if not more) managed to take the favorite characters and put them in a very, very funny story.
Toy Story was cute, I admit, and interesting for what it was (the first fully computer animated film), but Toy Story 2 honestly made you forget you were watching a cartoon.  The scenes where Buzz encounters his nemesis Zurg are among the finest moments of deadpan comedy and satire ever made - pretty impressive for an animated feature.
The DVD compilation sounds great, but unless it's your forte, the endless commentary and ""Making Of"" featurettes from Pixar/Apple/whatever may be more grating than interesting.
When Toy Story 2 was released, there was a short film that preceeded it (no, not that dreadful five-minute ""Dinosaur"" preview), but it was the feature that gave Pixar it's swing-lamp logo.  I certainly hope that it's included with the set.",961718400,2,1082,4.961325966850829

1168430,5,7883704559,"Both of these films are classics and for once the sequel, Toy Story 2  lives up to the high standards set by by Toy Story. The animation in the  first installment is breathtaking and set new standards at the time (1996)  - it is hard to believe that what you are watching is actually animation as  it seems so lifelike. Toy Story 2 takes the standards from Toy Story and  achieves the impossible... it improves them further. This is done by adding  even greater detail and texture to the characters and background and even  more frames of animation - the result is breathtaking. These sort of  pin-sharp images are what DVD was made for and the picture quality is  complely outstanding. The films are worth watching just for the visual  quality, but the story for both installments is top class two, taking the  basic premise that toys are actually alive but can only move when not being  watched by humans! In Toy Story Woody (Tom Hanks voice) is the favourite  toy and the story revolves around what happens when a new favourite appears  on the scene - Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear. What makes Buzz Lightyear so  funny is that he is a toy based on a superhero astronaut and he believes he  has superpowers! In Toy Story 2 Woody and Buzz have become firm friends but  Woody gets stolen by an antique toy collector and the other toys have to  leave their house to get him back. What makes the stories so excellent  apart from the graphics is the tremendous effort put in by the cast who  voice them - predominantly Hanks and Allen but ably assisted by many  others. Their voices bring the characters to life and there are subtle  similarites between the appearance of the toys and the people voicing them.  To conclue Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are both examples of movie perfection  that will be watched time and time again to enjoy the combination of  perfect visuals mixed with a superb cast and excellent storylines. These  DVDs deserve a place in everyones collection and are sure to be the amongst  the most played DVDs in there. Buy two copies in case you wear out the  first!",961718400,,2080,4.533692722371968
1168431,5,7883704559,"Disney will send you to `infinity and beyond' with this 3 DVD Collector's  set of `Toy Story' magic. You not only get' Toy Story' and `Toy Story 2',  but also a third DVD which overflows with all you could ever possibly wish  to know about the two films!
Each DVD has the option of widescreen and  anomorphic formats and has Dolby Digital Surround Sound and is  THX-Certified.  It will also have alternative audio variations as in `A  Bug's Life' such as music only, surround sound only, etc.
But what will  undoubtedly interest those considering this set is the third  DVD which  will contain, in the same format as the Collector's Edition of `Tarzan' and  `A Bug's Life', sections on development, early presentation reels, music  and music videos (including demo tracks), an on-set interview with the  characters themselves (and also with the voices behind the characters),  storyboards, the making of `Toy Story', abandoned sequences, character and  set galleries of concept ideas developed through to the end design,  documentaries of the process of digital animation, production progression  demonstration (using the angle feature to move through the various stages  of production), and all the trailers and posters used throughout the world  to advertise the films. The bloopers are also included and, what I  personally love, audio commentary by the film makers (Lasseter, et  al.)
Since PIXAR are part and parcel of `Toy Story', the collector's set  also includes what they suggest was a major part of inspiration to them -  an Academy Award winning piece of animation the company did called `Tin  Toy' which is a very nice extra just as `Geri's Game' in `A Bug's Life'  about a child's toy which has a life of it's own....made well before Disney  heads were scratching for ideas....
I would highly recommend this and if  it's half as good as the Collector's Editions have been for other titles,  this is going to be the pride of you DVD collection. It's worth paying  extra for this over the 2 DVD set since you get so much more - and since it  was the first ever feature length computer animated film, you're owning  history.

I had never before seen such lines  at a theatre, and such fuss, as was given to Toy Story, considering that it  was ""supposed"" to be a child's movie.  Although, after seeing it,  I fell under its spell, as only Disney can cast upon a person!
It's still  hard to imagine that the entire movie, down to the outside shots, and the  tiniest details, were all created within a computer.  The feel of the movie  was real, and I was pulled in to its world.
So...naturally (given the  dismal rate of failure for most sequels), I was a bit skeptical when I  first heard about Toy Story 2.  How could Disney possibly capture the magic  of the original, with an original script, and new characters to love?  Who  can ever explain the blessed Disney?  They just do it...they take a dream  and make it a reality.  Toy Story 2 exceded my expectations on many levels,  and holds its own as a revered Disney classic.  Kudos to Disney and Pixar!

But, with the addition  of several characters, the return of most of the original cast, and another  great script, this movie broke my expectations apart and I left the theater  being just as amazed if not even more than the first one.  I will  definitely have the toy box collection in my posession when it is released!",961632000,,589,4.37962962962963

This is also one of those rare cases where the sequel improves on  the original. Not to condemn the wonderful original, but the second is even  better. Its worth noting Disney originally planned the sequel as a straight  to video release, since they generally don't do animated sequels on the big  screen, but they were so impressed by its quality, they opted to release it  theatrically.
These movies should be watched by aynone who ever played  with toys!",961632000,,677,4.686440677966102

The first film was amazing, I had to drag my friends to see it as they insisted it was kid's cartoon then sat mesmerised like I did for an  hour and half at the wonder of this film. Not only was the story brilliant,  and the script both hiliarious and touching, but the computer graphics were  jaw dropping. Pixar always insisted they weren't going for hyper-realistic  graphics to make you think it was real and more for the cartoon look, so it  keeps it's cartoon look while still making you think that these Toys are  actually alive.
Toy Story 2 does what few sequels has ever done and is  better than the original. Not only has the computer visuals been updated,  with such touches as the old and new Buzz Lightyears being distinguishable  because the old one is darker, grubbier and shabbier, but the story is  immense. As with the original you sit and hope beyond hope they're going to  make it, even though you know somewhere deep inside they can't do anything  else. I think I've yet to meet anyone who didn't love both films, not just  for their ground-breaking visual effects, but because the stories had you  riveted to your seat for almost the entire film, and on the edge of it at  the end.

Combining a child hood  dream, of the majority of adults, of our toys coming to life with superb  animation and an actual storyline, Pixar produced one of the most enjoyable  movies of recent years. Excellent support characters complementing engaging  leads with numerous instantly classic scenes, the ""You are a  toy!"" scene being just one. With an adult subtext to many moments, all  audiences were entertained. The sequel introduced new characters, new  situations and while not as instantly enjoyable as the first was still a  great movie, containing subtexts, more developed human characters and many  funny moments.

1168560,5,7883704559,"There are only a few films that I can name where the sequel outdoes the original and this has made it onto that list. No wonder this movie is kicks some serious animated booty at the box-office, it's the complete package.  It's got a great story, wonderful characters, and to top it off it has no  live actors to screw it up, although there are scenes in this film will  make you think you were seeing live actors. The animation once again is  impressive but only slightly a step up from the original. I found the human  characters texturally better than the original and this is quite noticeable  when comparing the children from the original. The toy collector and a  cameo by another Pixar human are quite impressive too. But this movie isn't  just about the wonderful animation as much as it is about the characters  and story that they have created and that we love to watch.
The gang is  all back with a few new additions, adding more entertainment to the group  that we already know. I can't get enough of these guys and gals. Woody,  Buzz, Rex and Mr. Potato Head are always stealing the show, but now we've  got a few others to make us laugh as well as feel their sorrow. The story  is funny, complex, and thoroughly entertaining. It always amazes me at how  an animated film can do so much more than one with live actors. The  constraints of acting in a human body are gone and can be enhanced by  animations, giving more impact to the feelings and environment that can't  be attained in a regular feature. The themes about friendship and  abandonment are excellent ways for both kids to learn and adults to  reinforce and makes going to this film an experience that everyone will  enjoy.
And for all the movie buffs, techies, and trekkies out there,  there are plenty of references to science fiction films right from the get  go, which only added to the hilarity. I don't want to give away anything  about the film, but I will tell you that you get your money's worth and  more. So far this year, all the animated features I have seen, have been  more outstanding than many of the supposed Oscar contenders. It's too bad  that these films don't get more recognition than they do. I'd nominate Toy  Story and the Iron Giant if anyone would listen.",961545600,6,2258,4.495073891625616

""Uh, I don't get it"" and Mr. Potatohead taking  off his lips and... well, you need to watch it. You may even start using  lingo like ""gettin' kinda tense aren't ya?"" in your daily  conversation.",944784000,16,336,4.475409836065574

Aunque A Bug's Life es bastante buena, Toy Story es insuperable. Es para toda la familia, no solo  para chicos, sino tambi&eacute;n para grandes, podemos ver a muchos de nuestro  juguetes en acci&oacute;n.",939513600,2,330,4.9818181818181815
