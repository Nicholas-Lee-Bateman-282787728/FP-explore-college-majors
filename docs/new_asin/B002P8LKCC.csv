3964096,5,B002P8LKCC,Great ab workout - especially when you slow down and hold the poses for longer.  I love yogaworks because they explain the poses so well and lead you into them easily.,1277164800,2,167,4.387096774193548
3964097,1,B002P8LKCC,"I was disappointed with this video. After reading the description I thought I was buying a DVD that was a ""Core Yoga Flow practice"" and it was not that at all. The 40 minute segment is very choppy, there is no flow what so ever, and the instructor often stops all moves to explain things for 1-2 minutes before going into the next sequence. I was expecting a vinyasa style flow that had me sweating, but with all the stopping/explanations and the awkward transitions not of a normal vinyasa class I wanted to turn the DVD off 15 minutes in. Definitely for beginners.",1271030400,16,566,4.504854368932039
3964098,5,B002P8LKCC,"After working out with the YogaWorks Beginners' AM/PM DVD for a few weeks, I decided I was ready for a more intense workout. This DVD provides a full body workout with a focus on your abs. The instructors are very motivating and provide clear directions, help you breathe correctly and really challenge you. I could feel the muscles in my arms and legs working throughout the entire workout and I definitely felt the burn in my abs! This DVD can provide a fun, yet challenging workout for anyone. If you have forgotten some of the yoga poses, this DVD also has the Learning Guide to remind you. For those who are not able to attend classes at one of the YogaWorks studios, this is a great way to stay fit, healthy and active.",1264291200,16,725,4.458646616541353
3964099,3,B002P8LKCC,It is more of a beginner/low impact practice. I can't speak poorly of the content. It's easy to navigate and understand. I was just looking for a more advanced flow.,1391472000,2,165,4.533333333333333
3964100,5,B002P8LKCC,"Getting there with my waistline! :)  I gained when I changed locations, no gyms nearby - so I tried this.
I feel Much stronger and mucn more flexible.",1391212800,,150,4.357142857142857
3964101,4,B002P8LKCC,"This is a nice DVD for someone new to yoga and needs to know alignment and more.  If someone is strong, it will be easy.  If the person is weak, especially in the core and upper body, this will help develop strength.

It's made of three parts:  a 40-minute ""flow"" with Billy, a 9-minute ab workout with Jessie, and a 14-minute pose breakdown with the woman who's a modifier in the flow segment.

I've taken classes from Yogaworks trained instructors, and the instructors in this DVD reflect the training of Yogaworks, which is a positive.  Yogaworks is very much into proper alignment and moving with the breath.

The flow with Billy is really nice. It's not one breath with one movement. It's more like a few breaths with each pose, but I like that. It allows my body to develop strength, balance and flexibility.  Billy's instruction is smooth, positive, encouraging and pleasant.

The ab workout with Jessie is irritating. There are some cat/cows, planks, crunches and bicycles.  Her voice is irritating and she says some goofy things that are annoying.

The pose breakdown person has a pleasant voice and instruction style.  For someone new to yoga, this is a wonderful section.  Proper alignment is so important in yoga, and this section will be a huge help to any beginner or someone wanting to brush up on alignment.  What could make this section better is a chaptered menu so you could go to a specific pose instead of having to watch the entire segment.

For those people who are complaining this doesn't work their abs, please know that any balance pose also works your core, and your abs are a part of your core.  There are lots of poses in here where you are balancing, even though you aren't doing one-legged poses.  I was surprised to see bow pose (dhanurasana)in this.  There are a lot of standing poses, and those poses require balance (warrior II, triangle, etc.)  There are some nice twists, too.

I thought I'd use this DVD once and then pass it on, but I like Billy's flow so much that I plan to hang on to it for a bit.

Cuing:  Mirror cuing is used.

Music:  The music is nice but not obtrusive.  It's soft instrumental.

Set:  It's a set made to look something like a yoga studio with wood flooring, soft lime green paint, faux windows with light, some brick and wood.  Pleasant but not as nice as if it had been filmed outside.

Props:  Those who aren't flexible would benefit from having a strap and a block nearby.

Backgrounders: There are six backgrounds in the flow and ab portions.  Billy is a class participant in the ab section.

This is more like ""yoga as exercise"" with the Sanksrit names of poses used.  I'm normally not a fan of ""yoga as exercise,"" but I do like the DVDs from Yogaworks.

Again, if you are a beginner or you want ""yoga as exercise"" and are a beginner, this is a great DVD for you.",1382486400,4,2833,4.531620553359684
3964102,5,B002P8LKCC,Great way to target your abs.  I've really enjoyed the YogaWorks series of videos.  They are easy to follow and I like the option of the two different workouts.,1368403200,,160,4.482758620689655
3964103,1,B002P8LKCC,the core workout was ten minutes if that. i expected more. i guess being a beginner i did not like the 35 minute yoga program too fast for me. will return if i can.,1359417600,,164,3.8529411764705883
3964104,5,B002P8LKCC,"I am a big in-home yoga practice person.  Still in the ""beginner"" set really, but this is a fabulous addition to my DVD collection.  Easy to follow with excellent sets that really work out your ab area.  I cannot recommend it enough!",1357171200,,233,4.5
3964105,2,B002P8LKCC,"I hate to give something YogaWorks related only two stars, but I found the workouts on this DVD disappointing, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD.

There are two workouts on the DVD: a 9 minute Fit Abs workout and a 43-minute Core Yoga Flow workout.

The Fit Abs workout doesn't really have any yoga-specific elements and doesn't utilize any of the traditional core-specific asanas (e.g. navasana).  It's a series of crunches and plank exercises that you would do in any gym class.

The Core Yoga Flow workout is very slow. This longer workout does have more traditional sequences and asanas, but it's not exactly a flow workout where you move through one pose for each breath throughout the workout.

I was hoping that with this DVD I could incorporate some of the YogaWorks energy and focus on flow into my home practice.  Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't deliver.",1325721600,2,863,4.836734693877551
3964106,5,B002P8LKCC,"I think this dvd is nice in that a beginner can pick it up and get better, or an intermediate can enjoy a relaxing break from the more intense workouts. This dvd calmly goes through all the basic poses for an all around yoga workout, and there's an additinal 10 minute ab session you can choose to do or not do. I just finished it and I feel very relaxed and stretched.",1306800000,,369,4.138888888888889
3964107,5,B002P8LKCC,This yoga workout tricks you into working your abs! A bonus is that I felt very calm and relaxed at the end of the 45-minute workout.,1298505600,2,133,4.153846153846154
3964108,2,B002P8LKCC,"Wouldn't buy this DVD again... It's definitely a good yoga DVD but in my opinion it's just for beginners. The best part is that the instructors talk you through everything so well that it actually allows you to focus on your movement and not break your neck looking at the TV in order to follow the master yogi.
I got this DVD mainly to bring variety into my ab workout routine, but have to say that I was disappointed... However, one of my friends, who works out every blue moon, found some exercises rather challenging.
So if you are a beginner - go for this DVD because it's very explanatory and the exercises won't kill you!",1291680000,11,628,4.422413793103448

8376742,5,B002P8LKCC,"If you are looking for a soothing, easy yoga routine, this is not the DVD for you.  However, if you are looking for a fun way to shock your abs, then this is a great DVD to add to your collection.  It kicked my butt.  You do some crunches and planks (the poses made it more difficult that the standard) and in between you got to stretch out with fun yoga poses.",1424736000,,361,3.986111111111111
