8465641,5,B005CM1IM0,"I watched this along with my 8.5 yo son and 4.5 yo daughter. It was scary, but not over the top. It's a bit dated, but that's also what makes it a little innocent. We all really liked it!",1451347200,,187,3.8205128205128207

8465645,5,B005CM1IM0,"Damn man i remember beong a kid and loving the Goosebumps books and the show. I have alot of the books and ive got a good bit of the videos,but when i saw this one it reminds me of when i saw this on digital cable when i was like 17 and was on some mushrooms and remembered this was on in the room so i kinda felt as if i was going through the lair of the mutant. The colors are really cool so i could see how kids being introduced to it how it will catch their eye. I figure eventually one day when i have kids i can show them these and say that this is what i used to watch as a kid. I don't know it's nostalgia to me so i figured why not drop 6 bux for it. Took me back. I dug it,if you remember the show or have kids and want to show em what you watched when you were little this is the series.",1383091200,,798,3.6184971098265897

8465648,4,B005CM1IM0,"The Mask Mutant is real in the two part episode Attack of the Mutant that originally aired back in 1996. Skipper Matthews is a comic nerd, who starts to realize that his favorite comic supervillain is real!

In the Phantom Mask (1995) Brooke gets the lead in the the school play, but there is a phantom that haunts the school auditorium.

These are two great additions to add to your Goosebumps DVD Collection. I only wish that there will be complete seasons or a complete series released, but until then I will continue to collect each DVD release.",1345939200,3,549,4.591836734693878
