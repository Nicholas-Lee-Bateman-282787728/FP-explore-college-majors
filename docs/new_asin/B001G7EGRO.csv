8304264,1,B001G7EGRO,"Teenage Angst is a film I felt was cut in the half of it. Ok, its an European film, things are supposed to be guessed more than explained, but this was too much to me. So: spoiler alert! What was all that bashing of the guy meant for? It has some gay eroticism in itself, and thats why its marked of gay interest, but why didn't he reacted, at some point? Just to be part of a mini-fraternity? Too little to explain his behavior, after he was nearly drowned, isn't it? Thats a film in which I would demand an explanation, as its given in most American confortable movies.
The school itself is hardly convincing. Just some pals in classes with someone that seems to be the sole  prof, director, adviser, etc. But so much lack of information p. me off.",1444867200,,750,4.319148936170213

8304266,5,B001G7EGRO,"""Teenage Angst"" (2008; Release Date: 29 January 2009; 65 minutes) is a short film about four teens at an exclusive  German boarding school who form a little club that quickly devolves into little more than a youth gang for rich boys. When its two most psychopathic members attack a waitress, they are stopped by one of their own. The film then takes a sharp turn as the two troublemakers decide to focus their sadistic practices on one of their own.

The fourth teen, meanwhile, tries to stop the abuse but is torn between his sense of right & wrong and his desire to belong. The abused boy is unfortunately emotionally unbalanced and is unable to see the violent bullying for what it is.

""Teenage Angst"" seems to have generated considerable negativism among reviewers. Myself, I believe the intent was to portray (as brutally as possible) the horrors of bullying; in that the film succeeded. The actors are well cast and convincing in their various roles. The 65"" film length means the film moves along at a comfortable clip without getting overly bogged down.

The film is sometimes classified as a gay-themed film. However, none of the characters is overtly gay, nor is there any indication that anyone might be. There are no scenes of gay sex nor any dialogue to suggest any. The abused teen may appear effeminate to some viewers, but there is nothing in the film that suggests he is gay. This film is probably better described as ""gay interest"" as the film includes several bare-chested scenes of attractive young males.

Criticism that the bare-chested cover art is misleading is not accurate. On the contrary, each one of the four main characters appears bare-chested at some time in the film. So while the exact scene in the cover photo may not appear in the film, the photo is nevertheless accurate in portraying the type of content that the viewer can expect to see in the movie.

This is a well-made DVD. For an indie film, the picture quality is very good, and the soundtrack is sharp and easy to hear. I also enjoyed many of the songs used in the music soundtrack.

Despite its English title, ""Teenage Angst"" is a German language film. I have, however, read reports of DVDs that do not come with subtitles. So if you don't know German, be sure to check for subtitles.

The DVD comes with several extras including a short film.",1307232000,8,2340,4.690243902439025
