7995133,5,B0000A0WID,"As others have stated, the transfer of The Wasp Woman in this collection is by far the best quality currently available.

As a fan of the The Wasp Woman, I own three other versions, and all of them are blurry with poor contrast and awful sound. The version here is crisp, clear, great contrast, and is featured in the aspect ratio true to a drive-in screen (as opposed to cut to 4:3 like most other versions).

Outside of The Wasp Woman, The Giant Gila Monster has a below-average transfer, so collectors of that movie should research other options. Also the menu for this disc is somewhat cumbersome and obnoxious, but really that's a small price to pay for an A+ transfer of The Wasp Woman.",1463011200,2,692,4.528

7995139,4,B0000A0WID,"this review is for serious collectors of ""the wasp women""
THE WASP WOMEN,
I have bought many copies of this film through the years,
If your like me and like the film let me say this is the best print of this film out there,
I bought the alpha version and others and it was very poor,
dirt can be seen floating around on the right side of the frame,very bad print and sound,

*** THIS ""DRIVE-IN DISCS"" VERSION IS ANAMORPHIC 1:85 AND FILLS THE 16X9 SCREEN,**
**IT IS A VERY CLEAN PRINT WITH GOOD B+W BALANCE AND SOUND,**
**THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN, OF COURSE PLAY IT WITH NORMAL SOUND, ""NOT WITH THE DRIVE IN EFFECT"" THEY OFFER"",**

**THE MENU IS AWKWARD AND DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE THIS BUT IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT,**
**IF YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY, COPY THE WASP WOMEN SEPERATE ON DVD-R FOR FUTURE VIEWING,**

as far as the gila monster, the print is bad, buy the ""LEGEND FILMS VERSION"" GANGED WITH THE KILLER SHREWS,both are excellent quality,

*** hope this helps any fellow serious collectors out there,
I know its confusing because there are so many different versions of the wasp women
on amazon,but in my humble opinion this one is the best,
hope I helped any serious collector who likes the movie,
have a great day ! ***",1366416000,14,1219,4.428571428571429
7995140,3,B0000A0WID,"Of the two films on this DVD, I'd say the winner is ""The Wasp Woman."" Okay, so the film is low budget and the acting is questionable, but the face mask used to make the wasp woman was very creepy. Maybe I have a thing about bugs. There's something about those eyes and antennae which had me shiver just a bit.

Too bad most people can't enjoy a good old-fashioned horror movie without CGI or modern special effects. The Wasp Woman represents those bygone days when you could see two for the price of one at the local drive-in. I can't say what a phenomenal movie it was but if you're into the old black and white classics, I'd say give this one a shot.

As for the Gila Monster, don't even bother. This was really, really bad all the way. It's not even worth going into and wasting electronic ink to give a review. Take my word for it boys and girls: stay away!

Thanks.",1183852800,2,870,4.228915662650603
7995141,1,B0000A0WID,"I didn't have high expectations for this disc, but it didn't even meet my modest hopes. What a turkey.

The two feature films are bad beyond belief. I say this without having watched them from start to finish. At one point, a voice in my head said ""life is too short to waste it watching this junk"". So, I fast-fowarded through them to see if, by some miracle, things would improve. They did not. I won't bore you with the details, but will simply list the categories in which these films fail every test: camera work, acting, special effects, dialogue, pacing, and on and on.

But, to tell the truth, the main thing I was intested in was the disc's extras -- the period intermission shorts and cartoons -- which I hoped to use during my own home drive-in presentations. These are marginally useful, though the menu system on the DVD makes it very difficult to show them, since you have to renegotiate the menu after every 30-second clip.

And, finally, there's the issue of transfer quality. You don't expect a complete digital restoration of this kind of material, especially when a degraded soundtrack is touted as one of the disc's ""benefits"". But the framing was so bad that, on the film titles and the shorts one or more letters was cut off on either side. I'm reminded of the joke: The wife complains to her husband ""The food in this place is just awful!"" He replies: ""Yes, and the portions are so small!"" I would at least expect to get all the lousy video I paid for.

I rate the disc with one star, only because one-half star wasn't available. Maybe a good value for $1.99, but certainly not at the current price. Too bad; the idea seemed to have promise.",1115596800,4,1664,4.5
