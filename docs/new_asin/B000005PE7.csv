7903459,5,B000005PE7,"I felt this film had two great things going for it: Steve McQueen's performance and a beautiful and dramatic score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. McQueen's performance here as Papillon is much different from that of his ""Cooler King"" Hilts in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Here he is much more world-weary with no signs of flamboyancy but still determined and dogged. I felt McQueen's full potential in this film was hindered by the script which had his character linked to Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman) a mild-mannered counterfeiter who Papillon agrees to protect if he will finance an escape. There is just no screen chemistry between McQueen and Hoffman. In many of his films McQueen was essentially a loner with his own agenda (HELL IS FOR HEROES, THE CINCINNATI KID, BULLITT, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR). In his best roles McQueen was still the loner but he usually came through in the end either through self realization of his humanity or at the expense of his own ideals and/or his life (THE SAND PEBBLES, THE GREAT ESCAPE, SOLDIER IN THE RAIN, NEVADA SMITH). That is why the best part of this film is when McQueen is put in solitary confinement. Here we really see Steve McQueen the loner. Solitary confinement does not break him; it only strengthens his resolve to escape. Even though I liked Steve McQueen's performance as the unbreakable human spirit he represented I just never liked this film. This film is based on the novel by Henri Charriere supposedly based on true experiences. I don't see McQueen as the character Charriere wrote about. Frankly McQueen's talents are too good for this role. McQueen gives Papillon more depth than all the other characters in the film. Also McQueen's performance tremendously outweighs the script which is very plodding and just goes on too long. The film however did contain other good performances from Anthony Zerbe, Don Gordon, Bill Mumy and Gregory Sierra. Franklin J. Schaffner (THE BEST MAN, PLANET OF THE APES, PATTON and the underrated classic ISLANDS IN THE STREAM) directed the film.",1170374400,,2027,4.947214076246334
