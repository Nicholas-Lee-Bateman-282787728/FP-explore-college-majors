3053430,5,B0010X6JUQ,I remember waiting up late to watch each episode.  They were great stories.  A smart hero that did not need to shoot every bad guy in order to win.  More shows should be made like this one.  I hope to get a copy of the DVD's one day.  That would be something I have looked forward to for many years.,1223251200,8,299,3.9166666666666665
3053431,5,B0010X6JUQ,"I loved this show when it was on, and is one show that I recorded when I got my first VCR.  Although I still have most of the original recordings, some have not stood up to the test of time.  When I heard this was coming out on DVD it made my day.  Can't wait.  It was such a fun show and many of us have days when we feel like we are stuck in offices like Miscellaneous Affairs.",1211760000,5,379,3.759493670886076
3053432,5,B0010X6JUQ,"This was such a great show!  It had humor, drama, and great relationships between the characters.  I watched Adderly every week when I was a teen, and watched my VHS tapes (recorded off CBS late night) of it off and on until they were too old to watch.  No reruns ever, as far as I know, so I'll bet the DVDs would sell great.

Please release these DVDs soon!",1211068800,4,359,4.159420289855072
3053439,4,B0010X6JUQ,"I watched this show along with the rest of you, but I only remember (and have recorded)2 seasons.  If I am understanding this ad correctly they have 4 seasons available.  What they apparently have done is divided the seasons and are giving us 11 episodes for $45.00 and up.  I would love to have the show on DVD, because, as you all know, the VHS don't last.  But I cannot afford to pay $180.00- $200.00 for them.  Please lower the DVD's to a reasonable price so the fans can get them.",1275782400,,485,4.285714285714286

There is not alot of info, and these reviews seem oblivious to the fact that the DVD is available here.  One says he has the DVD but something here makes me wary.

Does someone have this?  Is it bootleg?

3053441,5,B0010X6JUQ,"Not only did I stay up late to watch, but when our local tv station stopped showing Adderly, I crawled up on my parents roof to point the antenna to another town 70 miles away. Fuzzy sound and snowy picture- but it was still Adderly!! Now,24 years later I have the dvds and I'm really seeing those episodes for the first time!! WOW!!",1267574400,,333,4.301587301587301
3053442,5,B0010X6JUQ,"I too must join in admitting that I would stay up late to watch this show when it ran back in the 80's.  I had the biggest crush on Winston Rekert and loved the byplay between him and the character of Mona...  Despite the fact that it languished in such a late timespot, it ran for several seasons which is a testament to the quality of the scripts and the actors.  V.H. Adderly was a brilliant agent, and despite the loss of his hand was still able to outwit the bad guys and keep everyone safe.  Unfortunately this never seemed to get him out of the basement of the I.S.I., but he took it with a shrug and a smile and kept on trying.  The show was a great mix of drama, comedy and action.  I have a few of the episodes taped on VHS tapes, but they're over twenty years old and the sound quality is very poor by now.  I hope that one day I will be able to add DVD episodes of Adderly to my collection.",1262044800,5,902,4.005586592178771

Great show, GREAT theme music, great scripting, great leads. Add my vote to get this series on DVD!",1253577600,4,331,4.910714285714286
3053444,5,B0010X6JUQ,"I, too, stayed up late to watch this show and still have an autographed photo of the sexy Winston Rekert.  It was interesting and funny and is particularly poignant in how the bommunists treat our intelligence agents and military.  Adderly with his field agent's skills, always read betweeen the lines and saved the day while the bureaucrats worried about filling out paperwork and covering their butts.  And he had a wickedly ironic sense of humor.  I have waited for years to get this show on DVD.",1253318400,,499,4.767441860465116
3053445,5,B0010X6JUQ,"I loved everything about this show.  Adderly is a man who was cheated not only by his enemies, but also by the people who should support him.  He always goes out on a limb, is promised promotions, and where does it get him?  But he never gives up, always gives his best, no matter how frustrated he gets with his superiors.
There is humor, too, mostly from his bumbling boss, Greenspan, played to the hilt by the late Jonathan Welch.  There's even a bit of romance with Mona, the adoring secretary who is always ready to help Adderly.
All the actors are great, too, above all Winston Rekert, of course.",1247184000,,602,4.445454545454545

8239037,5,B0010X6JUQ,"I could not for the life of me remember the name of this series.  We'd watch it faithfully when it first aired '86 to '89.  Funny, witty, clever, same exact story line every episode with the characters always falling into the same paths as they did all the other episodes but it was done with real panache.  It is one of our favorite TV show.  I've literally searched over a 5 or so year period trying to even rediscover what the name of the series was.  I always knew the 'dumb' guy in the office from some other series but I forgot what and the boss, the older guy.  I searched for him in other shows but never could track him down.  I was watching a Due South episode on dvd and there he was, Ken Pogue.  Now to see if I can get my hands on the dvds for Adderly, another journey altogether as none are available on amazon.  God bless.",1339200000,,837,4.117283950617284
8239038,5,B0010X6JUQ,"I am sorry to hear that the distributor for this has shut its doors on this project.

 Adderly IMO was a very good TV series with a number of good actors, Winston Rekert among them,  good dialogue, nice humor, smart and clever overall. Granted the show is ""dated"" in terms of certain things, but then every TV show and movie are ""dated"".

 Adderly was ""unusual"" in terms of the main character having a handicap of an essentially useless hand but the way Rekert acted with the character's handicap was highly credible and his motives for trying to get out of the basement level back into regular spy service was part of the impetus for him sticking his nose into things.

 This series needs to be released on DVD in full because is it interesting, well acted and fun.",1339027200,,766,4.507246376811594
8239039,4,B0010X6JUQ,It is a shame that Titlehouse e-Distribution failed before I was able to purchase a set of the very expensive dvd rebirth of the ADDERLY series.  Maybe some other Canadian company can rescue Adderly and get the dvd's back for sale on Amazon.com. The programs still seems to appeal to vintage tv buffs and would likely sell very well.  We can only hope.  gjvtvguy.,1330128000,,363,4.640625
8239040,4,B0010X6JUQ,"I loved this show, but watching made me realize how dated it is.  However, the actors are very likable.  I did watch all the episodes.",1299369600,,134,4.32
8239041,5,B0010X6JUQ,I've had my eye out for this to be available for years and ordered seasons 1-4. I can't wait to get them and watch Adderlys adventures again.,1299196800,,141,4.2592592592592595
