8486939,3,B005UNI31A,"In an unspecified time, sex crimes is an issue and Lady Ninja Kaede with her special sexual Ninja powers has to put a stop to it. If this sounds like Ninja soft core, it is. Girls in fish net body stockings, simulated oral sex, nudity, fake male organs, sex, and rape. Not much in plot. Some scenes written as comedies, but they didn't translate well.  3 stars for nudity",1461974400,2,371,4.3768115942028984

8486942,3,B005UNI31A,"Not the best 'babe with a blade' film. Very basic, uncomplicated, story.
So-so acting, dull predictable action, basic low budget fight scenes.
Made me want to sell my katana - or use it in the kitchen... didn't really
grab me.",1381622400,,226,4.675
8486943,1,B005UNI31A,What happened about the stuff? Why no DVD in the case? Are you cheating consumers? I really do not like it? Did you can explain it?,1373932800,3,131,4.076923076923077
8486944,1,B005UNI31A,"From the cover, and the production company, it looks like what it is. A cheap porn flick trying to tell a story. It tried to be an action movie with porn stuck in the middle. The main character was stiff and emotionless. In the second movie the actress tried a little harder but not much. The actors playing the Ninja Sex Nun (yep) and the gay Sensei were actally pretty good character actors. The special effects were cheap video effects. The bumpers for ""commercial breaks"" were neither funny nor cute. Just annoying. Some of the slapstick comedy is amusing. And as for the cover, don't believe what you see. Nothing on the cover reflects the movies except the costume. No big breasts with push-up cleavage in the first movie and certainly no bondage in the second. Just bad sex, bad effects and bad acting. The second movie IS more entertaining and you get a kick out of the bizarre visuals but you still walk away feeling like you got jipped. Not even good sex to make up for the rest. If bad Japanese cinema is your thing, knock yourself out. Otherwise, steer clear.",1344902400,15,1071,4.55440414507772
8486945,3,B005UNI31A,"Double your ninja pleasure! Number II was definately a little more mature with little attempt to have a sensical story but the main character is attractive and thats kinda the gist here! Dont expect any major martial art fight choreographies, you won't see them here, but you will see cute girls, some skin, and thankfully convienently covered or obscured dude parts!",1338508800,4,367,5.032786885245901
