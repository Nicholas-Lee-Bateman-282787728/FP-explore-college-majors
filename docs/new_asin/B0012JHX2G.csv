8246236,4,B0012JHX2G,"This movie is very well written. I love independent films because I am tired of watching high budget movies and high paid actors with boring storylines. This films starts out with a young professional woman named Rae who lives under the thumb of her boyfriend. She has two friends who make her life look perfect due to their own messed up ideas of how a real relationship should be. After seeing the light, she splits with her man and begins a long distance romance with a Mexican. Now she's playing a whole new ball game. This whole movie touches on many subjects dealing with stereotyping, prejudice and interracial romance. Although this film is funny and heartwarming, it has some very powerful messages about self-confidence, forgiveness and true friendship. In some of the Spanish characters, it was obvious that Spanish was not their primary language but, that does not take away from the movie. The chemistry between Stacie Thompson and Samuel Guevara is smoldering. Samuel Guevara....very sexy !!! Stacie Thompson does a wonderful job of transforming herself from an unsure woman unable to trust herself to an independent beauty. I love ""Ruby"" who plays ""Rae's"" best friend. She has one of those attitudes that most women have felt once in their life about men. I gave it 4 stars only because you can tell that it is a low budget film.
All-in-all, I would say a good movie to recommend if you love a good story and fun characters.",1204675200,,1439,4.806451612903226
8246237,4,B0012JHX2G,"What a wonderfully romantic movie!  Diane Kern did a fantastic job combining romance, comedy, and drama.  The story line keeps you attentive throughout, and the characters are very well written.  I especially enjoyed Ruby, played by Marcy Watkins.  As Rae's fun-loving, risk-taking friend, she adds energy and charisma to the movie.  She's a joy to watch, and Ruby kept me smiling every time she came on screen!

Rae, played by Stacie Thompson, is a sweet, naive young woman who desperately wants a soul mate.  She finds him when she least expects it, on a trip to Vegas!  Miguel sweeps her off her feet even though they don't speak the same language.

Miguel and Rae have a real chemistry together.  I found myself cheering for their happiness and holding my breath as a I waited to see if their relationship would last.  This is a great movie for date night or girl's night!  It's truly entertaining.",1204416000,2,902,4.748387096774193
8246238,5,B0012JHX2G,"Diane Kern has written a wonderful romantic comedy. I was drawn in by these characters as the movie went on. Many women can see parts of themselves in each leading female role. Rae, with her self imposed low self esteem, Ruby, with her devil may care attitude towards dating, and Emily, knowing her choice to date a married man is wrong, but finding every way to justify her decision.
As the leading character Rae finally breaks away from her overbearing boyfriend, you just want to cheer! As she begins her relationship with Miguel, their onscreen chemistry really shines through. This story line makes the inherent problems with long distance dating and culture differences something to think about. All of the actors did a wonderful job portraying each character. Samuel Guavera smolders with masculine sexuality. Stacy Thompson does a great portayal of self doubt growing into a confident, new woman. Outstanding is Marcy Watkins with her portrayal of Ruby. She easily display humor one moment and honest intensity the next. This is a great movie to watch again and again.",1203724800,2,1076,5.016759776536313
8246239,4,B0012JHX2G,"When I first sat down to watch this movie, I thought I was watching another low budget independent film. Within the first 5 minutes something hooked me and I was drawn in. Being a man I am not one to watch another ""chick flick"". The main character Rae (Stacie Thompson) is dating a real jerk who controls her every move. He keeps her from dressing up and looking good knowing if she does she would attract someone better. Rae goes to Vegas and meets a spunky Megan who talks her into cutting loose and helps turn Rae into a ""Hot Cinderella"". While in Vegas Rae meets Miguel a mexican who gives her a kiss that was so unbelievable I had to rewind and watch it again. Now the movie is even better because Rae is smokin hot. She goes back home and dumps her controlling boyfriend and begins a long distance e-mail relationship with Miguel. Rae also has two friends/co-workers who have serious relationship troubles of their own. Ruby hates men due to a previous disastrous relationship with a man who happened to be a mexican. Ruby takes revenge on all men and strings several along leading them to believe she loves them. Emily is one of those pathetic needy girls clinging to a married man mistaking sex for love. After a few visits to Vegas to see Miguel, Raes life takes a turn and she finds herself pregnant. From there everything falls apart. Miguels friend Fernando through jealousy does what he can to break the relationship up. He sinks very low by deceiving Miguel. Ruby tries to convince Rae that all Mexicans have wives at home and girfriends on the side. The story is intense the whole way through with some comedy relief as well. The acting is very good and,the story moves fast keeping you drawn in. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. I certainly did!!!",1202083200,4,1781,4.5170278637770895
