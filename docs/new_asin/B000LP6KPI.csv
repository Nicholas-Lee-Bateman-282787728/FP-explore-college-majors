2711732,1,B000LP6KPI,"I was extremely disappointed in this video.  I was using the Joyce Vedral book ""Fat Burning Workout"" and was looking for a video or dvd which would show me the correct posture and form for free weight lifting.

Joyce lifted the weights with very very poor form and anyone copying her moves will injure their shoulders - especially when doing side and front laterals.

I would not recommend this to anyone.",1185926400,10,405,4.676056338028169
2711733,5,B000LP6KPI,"It is a great workout with FAST result. That is my first weight training dvd and I could see difference in just few days. I'm doing it every other day (or I would be dead):). In the beginning it was a killer! Day 1 and Day 2 (but not 101). It could be borring if I look for entertainment but I concentrate on Joice movements and she is fast! Be ready for challenge.

P.S. Just a note from my recent experience: it might significantly improve weight-loss effect if add some jumping-jacks between each segment. Everything else is still as great and effective as before.",1177545600,16,567,4.451923076923077
2711734,1,B000LP6KPI,"this is such a disappointing dvd.  I watched it once and does not want to use it anymore..If I can only return this dvd.  So boring, it is just like somebody who used a handycam and film herself. I wish I would not have bought this.",1176249600,11,232,4.021739130434782
2711735,5,B000LP6KPI,"I'm new to weight training and found that this DVD led me though all phases of the exercises involved.  There are exercises for every body part and I have found muscles I didn't know I had.  Also, what I really liked was the exercises are for all ages, not just the young.  I'm in my late 50's and still have been able to do most of the exercises.  I have found that I look forward to each workout and am totally energized at the end.  I don't want to miss a workout!",1175385600,25,467,4.032608695652174
2711736,5,B000LP6KPI,I didn't have high hopes for this one but I have seen Joyce on daytime talk shows where Oprah and others swear by her books and DVDs.  Now I know why...talk about spunk!  She really got me up and moving!,1171411200,21,203,4.05
8162992,5,B000LP6KPI,always love her exercise programs,1413590400,,33,5.8
8162993,1,B000LP6KPI,I never saw anything about having to have a bench to do the exercises or I would not have ordered it -- I do not have a bench nor do I want to buy one !,1409788800,,152,3.25
8162994,5,B000LP6KPI,"I purchased the book first, and then decided to get this DVD. I have a number of various other exercise DVDs with fancy music where all the exercisers are synchronized in perfect movement with beautiful outfits on.....but I cannot do the moves!  Many will include doing 10 burpees followed by 20 pushups...then repeat 10 times.  I am 59 and am not even able to follow the ""modifier"" for most of those other DVDs.  This DVD is do-able for anyone, includes basic weight lifting moves and you don't have to be a circus acrobat to do the routine!  So, if you are looking to tone and build muscle, get rid of flab and basically get stronger...improving the overall shape of your body within a few weeks....you will be very happy with this DVD.",1398816000,,738,4.568181818181818
8162995,5,B000LP6KPI,"Fantastic !!
Noticed change in 3 weeks.
Really got in shape with this video workout.
Recommend highly for any one.",1380672000,,114,4.75
8162996,4,B000LP6KPI,I really like this DVD.  It give great instructions and tips.  Need a little better music but the weights training was exactly what I wanted.,1360540800,,141,4.6
8162997,4,B000LP6KPI,"Started working out using this DVD and some light weights.  A little over a week and I am already seeing progess.  It can be a little tedious at times but overall, Joyce's workout get's results.",1284940800,3,194,4.514285714285714
8162998,2,B000LP6KPI,I have several of her older VHS tapes and a book but this was a total waste of money. Everything was SO rushed and not done as well as her earlier work. I like Joyce's workouts but absolutely would not recommend this DVD.,1279584000,,221,4.162790697674419
8162999,1,B000LP6KPI,"Complete? No way. I am very experienced with weight training and I thought this program was just awful. There is not only zero emphasis on form, there are exercises on the Workout 101 Portion of the program that I have never seen before. ""Get in position"", she says, but never once does she describe the proper position or form for any of the moves. But you are welcome...no, encouraged... to buy some of Joyce's books or other videos if you want to know the proper form and alignment for the moves. And what's the hurry? The ""15 seconds"" beween pyramid sets rarely make it to 6. The sets are rushed and the moves seem to me very undisciplined. There are several places in the program where she calls for one move but does a different one, then catches herself and changes while continuing to count. Really, really bad.",1195084800,18,819,4.54054054054054
8163000,5,B000LP6KPI,"I bought this without knowing anything about Joyce Vedral, and am very happy that I did.  In fact, I have purchased two of her other DVD's for variety's sake.  The workout is thorough and goes quickly.  For reference I am a female in my fifties, who is not in great shape.  I feel very tired after the workouts, but feel great after all is said and done.  Joyce is a character, who makes the workout go by nicely.  I definitely recommend this DVD if you want to work out with weights, have three sets of weights (ie 3 lb, 5lb, 8lb, or the like), a weight bench, and a floor mat.",1190419200,29,578,4.162162162162162
8163001,4,B000LP6KPI,"I have a lot of workout DVDs and videos, but this one is right up at the top of my list.  Not fancy, no great music or cute backup workouters, just you and Joyce.  But she is truly fun and knowledgeable.  Turning on the DVD feels like meeting an energetic New York style buddy at the gym -- motivating and enjoyable.  And she's REAL -- she is nearly 60, looks great but not plastic, and has done it by working out, not surgery.  In terms of level, the DVD is flexible and most anyone can do the exercises if not all of them at Joyce's steady and relentless pace.  Don't worry, as she points out you'll work your way up to it.",1187222400,14,625,4.081967213114754
