8109509,5,B000EGEZD8,"This documentary about World War II is phenomenal.  The interviews with actual WWII Vets are so enlightening.  You get to hear the real stories.  These vets are mostly from the North Carolina area (it was produced in Charlotte, NC) but there are some from other parts of the country.  These men and women are survivors of D-Day, the Batann Death March, battle at sea on the Missouri, and other WWII events.  There are harsh truths and heartwarming stories of survival.  How I Survived World War II is a must see for everyone.",1290729600,,525,4.6521739130434785
