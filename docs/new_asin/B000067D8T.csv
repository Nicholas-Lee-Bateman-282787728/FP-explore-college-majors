They are really light stuff and are great to relax. It helps me to get a few new fashion tips, because Mary-Kate and Ashley are always very fashion forward!
If you're an Olsenfan you simply have to get this movie!!
By the way: I made my driver's licence test 3 days ago and didn't pass, so maybe this movie will help me surviving my sadness and make me try again!!",1023580800,,514,4.255102040816326

Their movies (and tv shows) appeal to a wide age group, even though some of the older fans are reluctant to admit they watch them. (Just to let you know, I'm 17). This movie looks like it's going to be cute, and just as fun to watch as the others. Who says that all cute movies can only be about sex and drugs?

Its about twins Taylor (Ashley and Kylie (Mary Kate) Hunter who have just turned 16 and got on a roadtrip to Utah to see the winter olympics with their friends Jenn, Toast, Sam, Danny and Lyndi. They meet another friend along the way Charly. The movie dosent focus of romances of Mary Kate and Ashley but rather on the secondry characters. Jenn and Toast make such a cute couple.

The only reason I watch the movie from beginning to ending is not because I thought it would get interesting sooner or later (but didn't) is because 1 of the cute guys in there was Billy Aaron Brown, who I thought was cute when first notice him in the Disney's movie ""Going to the Mat"".

Taylor and Kylie Hunter are sweet sixteen and licensed to drive. Grab a seat in their classic Mustang convertible as they set out on their very first road trip, to the Winter Games in Utah. Cute outfits, even cuter guys. And all kinds of friends along the way. But watch out for Olympic-size detours.
This movie is really cute and gives us a glimpse into what Mary-Kate and Ashley can really do! I think this is one of their best movies yet!

They are really great actresses, and even though the one friend acts a little too ditzy, it's still a really great movie. There friend Toast is hilarious! And really hott too!! I was at Blockbuster getting a movie with my friend, and we saw it so we decided to get it for fun. When we watched it we loved it! I really recommend it because it is a really cute and funny movie!!",1070841600,,495,4.061224489795919
1714504,2,B000067D8T,"This movie, which is about travel, shows just about every irresponsible thing a young person can do.  First, the girls get into a car and none of them ever wear seatbelts.  Especially with being in a convertible, they would be dead in any collision under those circumstances.  Later in the movie, one of the girls accepts a ride with a stranger -- another extremely dangerous decision.  I understand that when people watch movies they like to be taken away into a fantasy.  But it would not have altered the story to have the girls put on seat belts, or to have a former neighbor show up coincidentally to give the girls a ride.  I also do not agree with the decision throughout the movie to refrain from calling the parents in times of trouble.  Sixteen and seventeen year old kids are not equipped to handle these kinds of problems, and it is irresponsible to portray that as a goal, especially considering the audience that Mary Kate and Ashley typically attract. I have purchased just about every movie that Mary Kate and Ashley have made, and my whole family normally enjoyes them.  I have never been as disappointed as I was when I saw this one -- unlike the others, this one will not remain in my family's movie library.",1060041600,2,1227,4.570776255707763
1714505,5,B000067D8T,I am a big Mary- Kate and Ashley fan. I love every movie they did. I think I like them the most is because I have been everywhere they have gone so it brings back good times for me. When this movie came out I wasn't really into getting it. I have been where they were but from what I saw on TV it didn't look as good as there over seas ones. Back in March for my 19th birthday my mom bought it for me for me. I didn't want to be mean to my mom so I watched it. I loved this movie. Being someone who travles a lot I can so see this happing. Some of you say that parents would be mad about losing the car and all. I don't know about your parents but my mom would be thankful that I was ok. This is a great and funny movie. Just because it doesn't seem real doesn't mean it can't happen. Thank God it has never happened to me. If you are looking for some laughs and some adventure get your hands on this movie and hold on!,1057363200,2,919,3.766839378238342
1714506,1,B000067D8T,"I'm not even going to begin talking about how unrealistic this movie is because it's irrelevent.  What IS relevent is the clear lack of talent involved in this film.  The Olsen twins ARE NOT ACTORS!!!!  They are personalities.  They play the same characters in EVERY MOVIE THEY ARE IN.  If you are a particularly materialistic person, and go to movies because of the cute guy or girl or the cool cars or clothing, then this movie will be your dream come true.  But for everyone else, this movie is a horrible, nightmarish abomination on the face of the planet.  Here are the problems:
Acting?  None whatsoever.  I wish I could make money by being myself on film.  Dialogue?  Nope.  The words ""like"" and ""dude"" are uttered every five seconds.  Cinematography?  Repetetive.  The audience is insulted because obviously we can't tell the difference between one shot which is tinted blue, and another shot which is opaque.  Entertainment value?  Maybe if you like the whole ""road trip gone wrong"" thing.  But this is even poorly done because of the complete lack of any sense of humor.  Plot?  Predictable at best, confusingly simple at worst.  Climax?  A stirringly boring monologue of Mary-Kate's, in which she pours her heart out to an unknown teenage pianist.
In as few words as I can put it, I hate this movie.",1055894400,4,1310,4.754464285714286

1714508,2,B000067D8T,"Aside from the Olsen twins, I thought the acting in this film was downright...well, it was bad. The movie was also unrealisitic. What parents let their twin daughters, their 2 friends, and 3 members of the opposite sex go to a ritzy ski lodge in Utah to watch, of all things, the Olympics? And what parents give their kid a fire engine red convertible for their birthday? And what kids just keep buying zillions of plane tickets, throwing away about 200 bucks per ticket? And who thought a movie about trying to get somewhere would be entertaining? The only reason this movie got 2 stars was because there were a few remotely funny parts, and the Olsen twins were what held the whole movie together. Them not ending up with boyfriends was pretty funny - their friends did though. Usually their movies are like they say hi to a boy and he falls instantly in luv. Although Kylie does have an admirer in this movie...",1050105600,3,914,4.545454545454546
1714509,2,B000067D8T,"Getting There, a movie with Mary-Kate and Ashley was probably one of their worst movies they have ever made. This movie is an endless cycle of getting lost in the middle of nowhere constantly, with only a small portion being dedicated to Salt Lake City and the Olympics. The acting by most characters was not as good as normal, (Mary-Kate and Ashley were still great!) The one part of the movie that I really did like was when MK+A were at the Olympics and their friend breaks her leg, one of the twins hooks up with a really hot skiier and at the end of the movie when all of them go sledding.
There were some great parts in this movie, but I was overall disappointed.",1049846400,,669,4.317460317460317
1714510,5,B000067D8T,"Alright, the first thing I really wanted to say is, hello, they have chaparones in the Steve Erikson lodge!!! I wish you peeps would STOP finding SOME SORT OF REASON TO MAKE THIS MOVIE LOOK INCREDIBLY BAD, when it isn't! Hello peeps, this is the most PERFECT movie to watch in a sleepover, girls. And Billy Aaron Brown is the most HOTTEST guy ever, and all the people in this movie are PERFECT to play the characters, and if you have a problem with an incredibly awesome movie, Getting There, then.... you have no taste in Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movies. The best Mary-Kate and Ashley movies are Getting There (NO MATTER WHAT YOU PPL SAY!!!), Holiday In The Sun, Winning London, Our Lips Are Sealed, and When In Rome!",1044057600,4,720,4.546153846153846
1714511,5,B000067D8T,"This movie rocks. You must watch it for the characters, which are the best casted and most enjoyable of all their movies. The plot has been criticized by some but the movie has other important strengths. The plot is merely a shifting background for the hilarious personalitities. For example,Toast is a stereotypical surfer-dude who is just TOO obsessed with eating. ""Dude, Sam...  Lunch is like the fifth most important meal of the day.""  Danny is the leader of the boys, who you might remember from Holiday In The Sun.
Sam has a hopeless crush on Kylie (Mary-Kate). Many teens will be able to relate to their relationship.  Kylie shows girls a gentle, yet firm way of letting a guy down.  One memorable attempt to tell him she wasn't interested was, ""We're in that area... the gray area, between friends and...... Friends.""
Jen is really charming and sweet, and definitely maintains the beauty quotient for the group.  Guess who gets her s'mores-flavored kiss when they get to the lodge?  Lindy is the cute airhead, who seems to get excluded but ends up with one of the boys by the end. Charlie is the unexpected heroine of the group.  This time, Mary Kate is the wild one and Ashley is the cautious one.
As usual, the twins (and their friends) are enviable for their luxurious lifestyle and permissive parents. One of my favorite lines was when the twins' parents surprise them with a classic Ford Mustang and Danny says, ""Mr. and Mrs. Hunter... Think you could adopt me?""
The music really adds to the humor and emotion of Getting There.  For example, listen to the theme that goes along with all of the developing boyfriend-girlfriend moments.  The dialog is well written because there are a lot of inside-jokes you feel you are a part of.  The strength of the movie is its way of giving you a comfortable familiarity with the friends.
I recommend this movie to their fans. I finally bought it, after watching it five times. But in all fairness, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was their worst one!  I put it in again because there was nothing else on TV and then I discovered the things that made it hilarious and very endearing.  I think you will too!  This movie is different from all the others because it is never about the parents or catching the bad guys.",1042329600,,2280,4.6138613861386135

Now im curious and wanting to see ""Getting there"" because i couldn't watch it before, but i am in doubts. according to some reviews people say that there other movies are better than this one, others say that this one was excelent. My best friend who is also a big fan has seen and said it was to ""Sissy"" that the twins were whoping and whoing all the time and not really acting like themselves. Im still in doubts wether to buy it or not, wether it's good or not? I need more coments from you people to know it it is worth the money or not.

1714524,2,B000067D8T,"As usual in the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen films, Mary-Kate and Ashley play two 16-year-old spoiled rich girls who's parents buy them a convertible for their 16th birthday and allows them to take a road trip to Utah for the Winter Olympic games with some friends (both males and females). Along the way, they get into trouble when one of the cars is stolen, and they meet up with some kids who help them. First of all, I can't understand why any parent would give their 16-year-olds a car on their 16th birthdays (OK, maybe some with a lot of money but c'mon, a CONVERTIBLE?!) and then let them take a road trip across country! Maybe if the parents were on dope, but if they were grounded parents, then they should (I hope at least) know better than to do something like that. Also, why on earth were the actors in the film not wearing seat belts? Isn't Hollywood supposed to support the use of their actors wearing seat belts in movies and on TV? For 16-year-olds they should AT LEAST be wearing seat belts! There wasn't much of a unique storyline or plot, and I would've graded this film less but it's the Olsen twins and I don't really want to totally diss their films (I am a fan, after all...don't ask why!). Anyway, the acting is okay, especially by the Olsen twins, but you can't really relate to any of the characters. One of the things that I don't like about the Olsen twins' films is that they always play characters who just like to shop, gossip, and talk on the phone. And then they end up getting to go someplace like London or Australia where they meet cute boys and fall in love and everything has a happy ending.
""Getting There"" was a disappointing film. I do not really recommend it unless you are a huge Olsen twins fan.

They get lost about nine times by taking the wrong Greyhound bus, leaving their topless car in the parking lot with the keys in the car, and a lot of other stuff.

Since then, I forgot them, until ""Two Of A Kind"" arrived here, and I was a fan once again. But to fill the gap, I watched some of their movies, and it's not a big deal. In fact, it seems like they are all made by a formula, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all. It's clear that the goal of whoever writes their movies is to make as much money as possible, and since the name of the twins alone is a money-machine, they don't really care about making the plot interesting or watch-worthy.
I don't say it because I hate the Olsens, I say it because I am a fan. I think the girls have talent, though they do need to work on it a bit, and it's a shame that they're stuck in making silly movies that are only made to sell.
If the girls don't want to stay child-actresses for their whole life, and maybe some day be serious actresses, they should draw the line and start making more serious movies.

1714546,5,B000067D8T,"Ok, i absolutely love watching mary kate and ashley movies....and i am 18!!! My girlfriends and i have sleepover marathons....(which consists of only their latest movies) The plots are outrageous and unbelievable but thats what makes them so fun to watch. Some of the other reviews bash them for making unbelievable movies, but thats why they're entertaining. They're not intellectual, grounded movies.....they're more like fun daydreams. Anyway, i totally recommend their movies, at least the last 4. Their full of corny jokes and teenage plots, and they're just plain entertaining!!! AND, they're business achievements are freakin amazing for 16 year olds! So give them some credit and watch their movies!",1025395200,,707,5.4363636363636365
1714547,2,B000067D8T,"I think this is their worst movie to date yet, so totally unbelievable, just how much of their parents money did they acutally spend on that 'misadventure'? and please, like really does anyone get a classic car in a pink ribbion on their 16th birthday (they can in real life) but still. Their best movie was 'It takes two"" and the others were alright. i would recomend all their past movies. But their feature film coming in 2003 will be interesting to see.
oh and the guys in this one weren't even that cute!!",1025395200,2,510,4.4361702127659575
1714558,4,B000067D8T,"""Getting There:  Sweet Sixteen and Licensed to Drive"" features the further misadventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen who now at the age of 16 celebrate the almighty teen rite of passage, getting a driver's license and embarking on that first road trip.
THE STORY:
Mary-Kate and Ashley (playing Kylie and Taylor Hunter) turn 16 and finally earn their drivers licenses.  In celebration of their rite of passage the girls and a group of friends embark on a road trip to Salt Lake City to catch the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Who would have thought that getting to Salt Lake city would have been so hard though as problem after problem besets the beleaguered group of friends...
THE ANALYSIS:
Overall, like most Mary-Kate and Ashley movies the plot is perfectly harmless and entertaining.  The movie should appeal as a great, clean, kids/family movie.  The MANY comical misadventures of the group as they head to Salt Lake are amusing at worse and hilarious at best.
THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:
This DVD is actually chocked full of goodies.  Included in the DVD special features are:
1. One alternate ending to the movie:  SPretty funny.
2. Behind the Scenes mini-feature:  6 minute feature where the cast and crew (primarily the twins) talk about the movie and how their experiences filming it.
3.  ""Getting There"" Trivia Quiz:  Test your knowledge about the movie!!!
4. Party Planning Tips for Your Sweet 16 Birthday Party:  The twins offer their tips on how to make your Sweet 16 the best, even if you are on a budget.  Pretty good and sound advice actually...
5. Trailers:  The Multi-million dollar Olsen marketing machine was in full force here!!!  The twins shill the following from their extensive product line:
a. Their DVD/Video Catalog:  including ""Holiday in the Sun,"" ""Winning London,"" ""Passport to Paris,"" and ""Our Lips Are Sealed.""
b. The ""Getting There"" soundtrack.
c. Their ""Girls Night Out"" video game for the Next Gen systems.
d. Their ""So Little Time"" tv series action dolls.
e. The ""Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action"" cartoon series on ABC.

THE VERDICT:
In all, overselling in the DVD features aside, the movie was decent for a ""lazy afternoon"" viewing.  Olsen fans should love this installment in their ever-growing video franchise series and parents should be pleased with another clean, quality product from America's favorite twins.

1714559,3,B000067D8T,This movie was not the best- but it's watchable. Mary-Kate and Ashley go on a road trip with some teenage friends and get stuck in numerous very predicatable scenarios. Sometimes it goes a little too far with what happens to them- but it's my opinion. On the good side- the scenery is very nice and what a great way to celebrate your 16th birthday!,1024963200,,348,4.453125
1714560,4,B000067D8T,"Finally Mary-Kate and Ashley do something different instead of chasing for guys. This movie is awesome. I couldn't get enough of all the horrible things that happen. Not that I would like that to happen in real life, but atleast things don't go perfect like they usually do in their other movies. I also thought some parts were kind of funny. Its totally different then their older movies, Which I like instead of seeing the same old boring plot. Its about where Mary-Kate and Ashley and their friends are wanting to go to the olympics but on their way... However I have to admit it was a little predictable. I mean come on who gets a mustang for their b-day and then go on a great trip to see the olympics with their friends. If you ask me they seem like spoiled little brats to me. Every seen in all their movies they look the best they could be. Have some movie where they just woke out of bed with their hair all messy or something so they don't always look perfect. Try to do things more realistic. I love the twins and I have bean a fan for quite some time but they just seem spoiled. I did like this movie because they didn't end up with boyfriends. It is a little different from their other movies. But if I were them I would try to get into the big movies.",1024963200,,1265,4.231404958677686
1714561,5,B000067D8T,"Okay, so I may be a bit bias since my brother is the actor who plays Toast! But I thought it was a very cute and funny movie that will appeal to the younger generation very well. These two girls are very poised and mature for only being 16. They are great role models for young girls, unlike some of the other teenage half-dressed girls out there. It portrays the other path teenagers can take; a path without drugs, alcohol and sex. I'm very impressed with their business skills and maturity! I mean executive producers at 16?! That's unheard of! It's well worth your time to watch my brother play the dumb surfer dude along with this funny cast! Great job...dudes! (female, age 22)",1024444800,,683,4.516129032258065
1714562,3,B000067D8T,"This Mary-Kate & Ashley movie shows some improvement. As it has more diversity than Holiday In The Sun. Which I thought dragged on the girl meets boy storyline from their early films. This one goes in a different direction with more depth in the area of relationships. After watching it I was glad to see the Olsens are continuing to handle their potential influence in a positive manner. Okay, okay I know, so they get everything they wish, including fantasy parents and a sweet car. But hey, if you had a say in the making of your own fictitious film, wouldn't you dream big too?
The movie itself is all right and has pretty cool script editing, but some scenes are not all that fantastic. The music started out strong, but it didn't quite rock the film like previous ones. Also I think the movie has an over kill of hollering and yelling, not to mention the excessivly spunky characters.
E-yeah, that all did get a little obnoxious after awhile.
But dispite all that this movie has the right attitude and is another good choice for a teen audience.",1024272000,2,1051,4.5661375661375665
1714563,3,B000067D8T,"I just got the movie, and I was so excited to watch it.  But it wasn't that great.  :(  I mean it was ok, but i definently liked their other movies better than this one.  I would say it's kind of boring, and the weather in Utah made it seem even more depressing (though Utah's supposed to be like that, I understand).  Though I really liked how mature and responsible they acted and I liked the true meaning of the movie.  It was mainly about growing up and just having a cool time with your friends.  I really enjoyed that.  I would recommend you see it, but don't buy it.",1023753600,,573,4.1454545454545455
1714564,5,B000067D8T,"I thought it would be hard for MK&A to make a movie better than their last movie Holiday in the Sun. Well, I was wrong! Getting There is a hundred times better! It has a great storyline and is awsome. I think the older the twins get, the better their movies get! so everyone, if you are a Mk&A fan BUY IT!!!!!ITS GREAT!",1023753600,,319,4.079365079365079
1714565,5,B000067D8T,Wow! Mary-Kate and Ashley never stop! I've always loved watching Full House and now I love watching all their new stuff! I have all their movies and I'm not afraid to admit it. Even though yes they are always rich and perfect. It's cute and lets me escape from everyday stuff. I can't wait till this comes out and their movie in Rome! Maybe they'll come to Florida??? :),1023667200,,370,4.3768115942028984

7962633,5,B000067D8T,"First off, I have to say that Getting There is a very good Olsen movie! Despite what other negative customer reviews say. This is a very fun and cute movie for teens! It's one of my favorite Olsen movies! I think Mary-Kate and Ashley are great actresses and make very good movies. I would say the topic of this movie is definitely comedy and adventure. There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie that will make you laugh! I love the characters, music, and message that this movie provides. This movie is basically about having a good time with friends! People who think this movie is cheesy, have to remember that's how movies were in the early 2000's. That's what made them so great! Not to mention also, that this movie is appropriate for all ages and way better than movies these days. So give them some credit. Now, this movie is about two sixteen year old girls, Kylie and Taylor Hunter, who both just got their driver's license and are taking their friends on a road trip in their new car to Salt Lake City for the winter Olympics. A lot of mishaps come around, but they know how to make the best of difficult situations and end up having a great time with their friends after all! Mary-Kate and Ashley movies are just sooo fun to watch!",1468281600,,1246,4.3982683982683985
