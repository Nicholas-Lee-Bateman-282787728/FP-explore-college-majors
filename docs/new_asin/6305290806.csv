1008323,1,6305290806,older movie low cost did not hold my interest did not make it 5 mins.,1454544000,,69,3.6666666666666665
1008324,1,6305290806,"This picture was released in 1987 starring Gianna Ranaudo as Barrett Hopkins, Martha Peterson as Shannon Murphy and Renee Riaford as Violet Brown. Barrett, Martha and Violet all graduate from the fire academy and are now looking to move on with there careers as fire fighters. However, there's one big problem! First, the girls are assigned to a firehouse that the city is looking to close because of the neighborhood and the lack of funds. Second the fire fighters that are already there are not interested in having three female fire fighters. Three thing, is that someone or a group of someone's is going around the neighborhood setting ***** and no one knows who it is. This movie was bad right from the beginning and I loss interest about 15 minutes into it. Therefore, I give this picture 2 weasel stars and that's being nice.",1389571200,2,832,4.744827586206896
1008325,3,6305290806,"I gotta say, this is probably one of the dumbest movies I ever saw but I collect Julia Roberts movies and this is the first one she appeared in (for about 3 seconds!!) so I am happy to have it in my collection.",1361318400,4,210,3.9069767441860463
1008326,1,6305290806,"For the longest time I swore Julia had nothing to do with this awful movie, but sure enough there she is - in bright red pants walking up a staircase in the Firehouse.  She doesn't say a word, but it sure is a trip to see her.",963446400,3,226,3.8085106382978724
7887488,3,6305290806,"As bad films go, it's tolerably amusing. Obviously played in slapstick mode with deliberate overacting.  By that standard, a low one to be sure, it's watchable. Other reviewers have mentioned boobs. The ones in ""Firehouse"" are very watchable, if that's important to you.",1521244800,,270,5.27906976744186

7887491,1,6305290806,"Got a little over 20 minutes in. The best joke in that time happened less than a minute in when someone sets an arsonist's fire off before he can and his butt gets burned. The jokes try too hard and have bad delivery, especially the ""jokester"" character. Audio is horrendous and I think a lot of it had redubbing done poorly, probably due to echos in the firehouse. The boobs that show up every 3-5 minutes are nice, but not really worth watching the film.",1509840000,,456,4.376470588235295

7887493,3,6305290806,Funny in parts with a well developed story line.  Includes critiques of macho sexism and arsonist redevelopers.  Attractive female leads albeit not much in the way of acting by any of the players.  Saw it decades ago on television and was worth watching again.,1476057600,,260,4.863636363636363
7887494,3,6305290806,"It is what it is,this movie isn't for viewers with high demands. It's low budget, corny, semi funny, and if you like this genre of movies like I do, it's fun to watch.",1474243200,,167,4.090909090909091

7887496,1,6305290806,"It is not a Christian film as Amazon Prime has listed it.  Total trash, nudity of females, vulgar so called humor and just plain STUPID!!! How in the world could Amazon Prime consider this film in any shape or form be a Christian film?",1461110400,3,235,4.340909090909091
