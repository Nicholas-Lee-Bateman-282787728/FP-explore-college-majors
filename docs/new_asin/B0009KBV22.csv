8174971,5,B0009KBV22,"Great film, only wish it had an English sub-title. The music more than compensates for the non-English sub-title. I have viewed it numerous times and it's still exciting to watch!! Salsa!!!",1378684800,,189,5.129032258064516
8174972,5,B0009KBV22,"This is a great salsa movie. If you like Cuban music and are a bit interested in salsa you gonna live it. It is, fun very fun.

It is a simple story about girl meeting boy but there are many complicated twist and turns in the story and a lot of things happening around. The core of the whole movie is CUBAN MUSIC. There is son, salsa and cha cha cha. A heartbreaking happy end that makes you wanna fly away on your dancing feet. Watch it!

The movie is much better than Havanna Nights (Dirty Dancing 2) and Dance with me. I guess it depends on the music and the French production. Not the script itself.

Most of the music you will recognize - they have become superhits. I you like Cuban piano - you will find yourself in heaven.",1167868800,2,730,4.163120567375887

It is in french but it has enough Spanish so you can understand it.

The music is great.

I love this movie.",1167782400,,155,3.935483870967742
