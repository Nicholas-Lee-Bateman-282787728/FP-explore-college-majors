7860808,5,6304039476,"Remember watching this movie several times and never tiring of it on cable TV back in the early '80's when cable seemed desperate for theatrical content to get new subscribers by airing not so well known ""straight to video"" movie releases such as ""Beast Master"", ""Dragon Slayer"", ""Eraserhead"" and ""Klondike Fever"".

I have to say this movie still holds up as a solid, well written and acted wilderness adventure filmed on location in British Columbia, Canada. The production quality is similar to ""Little House On The Prairie"" reruns viewed on my Sony Blu-ray BX2 in that the color is quite a bit on the warm-ish green side but sharper for Standard Definition of that time (made for TV movie feel in sound & picture circa late '70's). Some Hue/Sat adjust toward red and reduction in the green channel White Balance Offset on my Samsung HDTV fixed it quick. I had to watch it in 4:5 aspect ratio to get the best picture quality and prevent actors heads looking too wide. That didn't take away from its entertainment value.

I wish they would thoroughly restore this movie from the original master to really do justice to its beautiful Canadian wilderness scenes and authentic looking 1897 period set design and costumes. The pacing, dialog (especially hearing those heavy Canadian accents by way of Fargo) makes this movie more entertaining than most current family friendly movies.

The story isn't a sappy boy and his dog tale. There are no ""Old Yeller"" sad scenes where the boy talks to the dog as if he understands what he's saying. The dog isn't the central figure but only acts as a bargaining chip and protector of the hero against ""Soapy Smith"", a mob boss type bad guy who claims ownership played very menacingly by Rod Steiger.",1448582400,,1736,4.78

7860810,5,6304039476,"A wonderful movie about the adventures of Jack London. If you love movies about the Klondike, saloons, dogs, cabins, snow, hard living and survival, you'll love this movie.",1264809600,3,172,5.178571428571429
7860811,5,6304039476,"The basic idea of the plot is that it follows Jack London's adventures on his way to the Yukon gold rush in 1897. Featuring an introductory voice over by Barry Morse, the film certainly starts on the right note.

Filmed entirely on location in British Columbia, Canada, ""Klondike Fever"" features many notable Canadian actors including Lorne Greene, Gordon Pinsent and the previously mentioned Barry Morse. All are excellent. Star Jeff East goes over the top occasionally, but he is an appealing lead with a mix of youthful idealism and strength. Jeff East does seem to have a good Odd Couple type rapport with actor Robin Gammell as his sidekick Sloper. Angie Dickinson is also notable among a cast of well-drawn and distinctive characters. The production design, music and costuming are also all commendable. The film looks and feels very authentic, which of course was helped by the location shooting.

This is good, clean ""family"" entertainment. A classic tale of good guys vs. bad guys. Soapy Smith is the loathsome leader of the bad guys, and actor Rod Steiger gives his all and makes the viewer hate Smith almost as much as Jack London does.  ""Klondike Fever"" has both cheer and tragedy, adventure, honorable morals, humanity and heroics.

My favorite scene features Barry Morse driving a sled dog team and brandishing a shotgun as he races in to save our hero London and his sidekick Sloper from a shoot-out ambush at the hands of the gang of baddies - it's a wonderful sequence, and a highly distinctive moment in Morse's film career.

The DVD release itself features a Full Screen picture, with acceptable image and sound quality. It's nothing spectacular, but it's perfectly acceptable. Especially when one considers the incredibly cheap selling price on these DVD's! Come-on, people, if you're only going to pay $5.99 for a brand-new DVD (or if you're pinching pennies, $1.91 for a used one), I think you absolutely get your money's worth here! I try to buy widescreen discs myself, too, but when one isn't available I consider how much I want to watch the film and make my decision accordingly. It's unfair (as the last reviewer did) to give a poor review to a movie just because it isn't in widescreen format. What about the movie itself?

Overall, I do highly recommend ""Klondike Fever"". While clearly not a Hollywood-style blockbuster (this is a modestly budgeted Canadian film, which does the most with its money, cast and settings), this is a charming and good-hearted film, well made and well acted, and worthy of being either re-discovered or discovered for the first time now that it is available on DVD. Enjoy!",1231459200,7,2631,4.914414414414415
7860812,2,6304039476,I try very hard to only buy widescreen DVD's.  This was advertised as Widescreen and even the plastic case says it is.... but it is formatted to standard TV size.  Such a cheap DVD that it is not worth the hassle to return it but buyer beware...,1172793600,4,245,4.191489361702128
7860813,3,6304039476,"When 21 year old Jack London participated in the Klondike gold rush in 1897, he experienced many exciting events and the closely observed knowledge he acquired of men he met with in the chilly north was used prototypically in the tales and novels that brought him far greater success than did his attempt at mining. As an opening enscripted frame makes clear, the episodes depicted in this film are fictional but in some instances they parallel occurrences of the young author's stay in the Yukon, as we watch Jack, played earnestly by Jeff East, disembark at Skagway, Alaska, rescue a dog from harsh treatment, overcome many natural obstacles to reach the minefields, woo dance hall girls, compete in a dogsled race, and make friends and enemies along the way. A rather substantial budget (for a Canadian-made film) is in place and a good deal of footage is shot, leading to post-production difficulties of editing and sound mixing (problems of asynchronism appear), but the product is never boring, and there are solid contributions from the crew; unfortunately, the work disappeared after a two week run. East has a narrow acting range but Peter Carter directs him well, with London's early commitment to Socialism being subtly addressed, while Angie Dickinson as owner of a saloon walks through her part, but Rod Steiger, employing his Method methods as principal villain of the piece, Lorne Greene as supervising Mountie in Dawson and Gordon Pinsent as an inveterate gambling man each controls his scenes. Credit must be given to those who make the work visually agreeable, notably Seamus Flannery for production design and Patti Unger for accurate costumes; a pleasing score is contributed by Hagood Hardy; all in all, in spite of its flaws, this film was worthy of being produced and is worthwhile to see.",1115942400,3,1812,5.023255813953488
