4099923,4,B003A6C702,"The British are not too well known for their culinary skills.  In this series ""Pie in the Sky"" one would never think the aforesaid to be true because the ""hero"" of this series, Henry Crabbe (delightfully played by Richard Griiffiths of ""The History Boys"" fame) owns a restaurant in a small resort town and he seems to turn out some very luscious food while at the same time acting as a part-time policeman/detective helping his very egotistical police boss, at solving some dastardly crimes.  Although series three (3) of this program still maintains its original premise (head chef and restaurant owner not allowed to retire from the police force while, at the same time,  maintaining both jobs)  there have been changes in the restaurant; however, the characters that are gone were rather minor and, all of the main characters are still around played by the same actors:  that is Crabbe's super accountant wife humorously played by Maggie Stead;  his status seeking police boss; and Crabbe's police/detective assistant, Sargent Cambridge,  played by a very beautiful and talented actress.  That said, the food still looks gorgeous and the mysteries are still engrossing in Series three (3) of this program with very little violence so that one can sit back with something good to eat and be highly entertained.

Indeed this program continues to really delightfully entertain me with me being an extreme lover of good food and a lover of the British Mystery/Detective genera.  This series has it all in abundance--mouth watering food plus good mysteries that are greatly acted and directed.  If you like good food and a good crime mystery, buy this two (2) disc 294 minute set.",1284336000,2,1678,5.0
4099924,1,B003A6C702,"First of all, this is a wonderful series.  BUT,  I preordered this in March, 2010,  as a 4-disc, Series 3 AND 4 set.  Yet, what has arrived is Series 3 only. My invoice states it is a 4pc DVD , Series 3 & 4.  A search of the data base shows only Series 3.  What happened to Series 4?  I am a big Pie in the Sky fan and this is a major disappointment",1284076800,4,349,3.635135135135135
4099925,5,B003A6C702,"First let me say this is an outstanding series and well worth the price. The programs provide solid doses of detective drama as well as comedy revolving around a restaurant Inspector Crabbe is trying to open and begin his second career (once he can leave the police force).  I was really surprised when my order arrived (which Amazon had listed as containing both series 3 & 4) and only series 3 was in the package.  Hopefully, Amazon will soon carry season/series 4 and 5 so I can complete the set.",1283817600,3,499,4.533333333333333
4099926,5,B003A6C702,"A recipe for mystery is perfected in Series 3. One full measure of crime investigation, a separate heaping scoop of restaurant drama, garnish with crisp comedy...a-la-PIE IN THE SKY. This DVD entertainment is as big as Detective Henry Crabbe's belt. Richard Griffiths is superb in the role of a copper wanting retirement, who also is a fine chef. Wife Margaret (Maggie Steed-""Clatterford"") takes care of the restaurant books and legal end. ACC Fisher (Malcolm Sinclair-'The Young Victoria') makes sure Crabbe has crimes to solve with the help of DC Sophia (Bella Enahoro). Beautiful waitress Nicola (Samantha Womack-""EastEnders"") is the best looking dish in the restaurant.

For newcomers, ""Pie In The Sky"" is the name of the Crabbe restaurant introduced in Series 1. Each show is a double plot, with a crime investigation going on at the same time something dramatic is happening at the restaurant. Crabbe is caught between the two locations. Comedy manages to get stirred into both mixes, especially through the droll humor of the dialogue. The wit is the meringue pie topper.
This is quality crime/drama/comedy viewing for the whole family. Very family friendly.

Six episodes in Series 3, each about 49 minutes and ALL WITH SUBTITLES. Alas, will they ever provide recipes of the food created in Crabbe's kitchen?

Episode details:
1-MONEY TALKS
Henry dreams of criminal Hooperman (Michael Kitchen-'Foyles War') re-shooting him. Restaurant staff has dwindled and Crabbe's on look-out at a pizza joint. Need of a new chef and bank loan takes time away from cop duty for Crabbe.

2-GAME PIE
Crabbe caters a pheasant shoot affair attended by cop boss Fisher. Did Fisher kill a man helping as a beater? Crabbe is ordered to find out who-dun-it. Unfortunately the DVD doesn't offer a taste or recipe for the Game Pie (venison, rabbit, pheasant.)

3-IRISH STEW
Henry caters an Irish wedding containing an American groom. The TV writing groom's briefcase filled with 'papers' is stolen. Mrs. Crabbe knows the groom (played by Nigel Terry), and his friend, and they are one in the same. Why?

4-DOGGETT'S COAT AND BADGE
Restaurant regular, Rider, is recognized by DCI Daggett attending a cop retirement party booked by Henry. Rider's in a witness protection cover and in trouble. Another retired cop, Striker (Maurice Denham), is involved. Can Crabbe help?

5-THIS OTHER EDEN
The crime is plant theft--dug from private gardens. The National Horticultural Division assists, or tries, Crabbe in a stake-out to catch the di-shoveled crooks. Margaret hires the prime suspect. Oops.

6-CODDLED EGGS
Crabbe gets bossed around by a female investigator, a female restaurant inspector, his wife, and as always, Fisher. Suddenly the investigation goes international. The fresh restaurant's brown eggs are discovered to come from the hens bottoms, direct to the kitchen. Big discoveries in both plots.

Forget the popcorn, serve pie to all the family, even the kids, for this family-night viewing.
FUN. Just down right fun.",1279843200,16,3007,5.221991701244813
4099927,5,B003A6C702,"If you love food & love a great mystery, this is the series for you.  The British & country-side setting is quaint and gives you the feeling of a bed & breakfast.  The mystery stories are clever puzzles and not at all gruesome.  I highly recommend this series!",1279152000,12,260,4.375
4099928,4,B003A6C702,Richard Griffiths provides a wonderful detective ala Nero Wolfe.  He is likable without being pompous.  Still like to go back and rewatch them.,1359936000,,143,5.173913043478261

4099930,5,B003A6C702,"The ""Pie in the Sky"" DVD series is great fun. Richard Griffiths as inspector Crabbe is magnificent and the rest of the cast is right up there. To understand the connections you have to have seen Series 1. What I find to be particular fun is although the main theme is about crime there is a secondary theme of foods and their preparation. An excellent product of the BBC. I can hardly wait to receive Series 5 which I have on pre-order at Amazon.",1310428800,,446,4.321428571428571
4099931,5,B003A6C702,"We are enjoying this series so very much.  Funny, well written, very little violence like so many of todays made for TV and the characters are delightful.. I highly recommend for anyone wanting to be entertained.",1305158400,,212,4.888888888888889
4099932,5,B003A6C702,"I did not expect to enjoy this series so much. A fat chef as a detective? Please! I'm now hooked, of course. The plotting and character development are excellent, and I've pre-ordered the next season! Other reviewers will tell you the plots and list the characters. It's their growth that I enjoy, and the development of their relationships. This is adult television, and allows you to be an intelligent observer rather than insulting that part of you.",1292976000,3,452,4.883116883116883
4099933,5,B003A6C702,"Britain's delectable 'Pie In The Sky' TV show ran for five series, and aside from being the name of the Crabbe restaurant, is also a great theory on how someone can run a successful restaurant and crime solve for the Police at the very same time!

That aside, and mysteriously with only six (6) episodes here in the third season to prove it, 'Pie in the Sky: Series 3' is as on form as ever; and is, at all times, high quality drama/comedy viewing for the entire family.

Before we tackle the episodes, did you know that the building in Hemel Hempstead that was used as Henry Crabbe's restaurant was a florist at the time of filming - but has now since become a restaurant named ""Pie in the Sky"" in real life?!

Anyway, in 'MONEY TALKS,' we open with Henry having a nightmare that the criminal mastermind, Hooperman (Michael Kitchen - 'Foyles War') who shot him at the beginning of the series, had come back and shot him again! Thankfully, not though, but he has other things on his plate. Like Steve and John having left the restaurant, the numbers are down, he needs to ask for another bank loan, and he needs a new Chef! Couple with that the fact he now has to take control of a stake-out of a local pizza place and Henry is close to breaking point!

In 'GAME PIE,' an episode opened by the glorious tones of Alison Moyet's 'Love Resurrection,' Henry loses/mislays the weeks takings and so has to take on a catering job (complete with his special Game Pie - venison, rabbit, pheasant) at a Pheasant Shoot - attended by his boss, ACC Freddy Fisher (Malcolm Sinclair). A killing happens in the woods - is Fisher a killer? Henry is ordered by the higher Brass there in attendance to find out whodunit. This comes with a very nice twist ending that I only saw coming right at the very end. Nicely played.

Admittedly, 'IRISH STEW,' is a very, very slowburner of a story - one about some hotel thefts and a man claiming to be someone that he turns out not to be. This story revolves around Margaret (Maggie Steed - 'Harry Potter') for most all its screen time, and she is as adorable as ever in the lead role. Back at the restaurant, Henry caters an Irish wedding - on that should have been for a happy occasion, but due to Margaret's Miss Marple act, takes a slight turn!

In 'DOGGETT'S COAT AND BADGE,' the brilliant Nicholas Ball ('Hazell') plays DCI Daggett, the right hand man to his retired Police boss Striker (Maurice Denham). One the hunt for a man that once stole something from them both some 30 years prior, that man, Rider (John Castle) is recognized by DCI Daggett - who is attending a cop retirement party booked at Henry's restaurant, of course! But, Rider is in witness protection, for why, we never quite find out, and so a game of cat-n-mouse reveals itself.

In 'THIS OTHER EDEN,' private gardens, with freshly-laid, exquisite front and back lawns, are being stolen back by in-the-dark thieves! Now, to be honest, who it was (partly) was 100% obvious from 15 minutes in, sorry! Anyway, we also get shown a new level to the Police force, that of The National Horticultural Division! They assist Henry in the solving of this case, that culminates in a) Margaret hiring the prime suspect, Toby Wellbeloved (Tim Dutton), b) said prime suspect doing a fantastic job on creating her outside garden for eating, c) and getting himself arrested for handling all the stolen goods that filled/created said outdoor garden at Henry's restaurant!

In the final episode, 'CODDLED EGGS,' (two words that, in my mind, should never be written next to each other!), a simple stolen car ring turns out to be something a little meatier. But, in this episode, both ACC Freddy Fisher and Henry are getting bossed around by a female! Fisher's is Det Supt Chalmers (Phyllis Logan), who is trying to get Henry fired and work her way up the internal ladder, and Henry's is Ms. Forelle (Serena Evans), a health/restaurant inspector; who is taking her job way too seriously! But, come the end, both men win their respective battles, and we can all sit back now and wait (slightly impatiently) for series 4 of this great series to hit DVD!",1286409600,2,4127,4.590230664857531

4099937,3,B003A6C702,"As a devotee of Series One and Two, I was pleased that Series Three was finally available. Sadly, some of the key relationships that ran throughout the first two series, making them such a delight, are missing. Gone are the young chef and waiter - even Margaret is missing from half the episodes! Crabbe spends most of his time out in the field investigating - without Fisher having pulled him away from the restaurant. Henry seems to have returned to police work almost full time on his own without being forced - and his restaurant has been relegated to a supporting role. Here's hoping that Series 4 returns to the wonderful relationships of the first two series.",1284681600,12,666,4.700854700854701
