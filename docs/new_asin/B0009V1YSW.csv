2323682,5,B0009V1YSW,I'm a straight guy and don't speak Japanese and yet I managed to love this movie. I think what I like best are the characters and the relationships between them. The rest of the storyline kind of takes a backseat. At the end I was left wanting more.,996537600,9,249,4.208333333333333
2323683,3,B0009V1YSW,"This is somewhat of a groundbreaking animated feature and you certainly will not see anything like it in the U.S. However, the plot is very confusing and extremely hard to follow. It feels as though you are thrown into the middle of the story and there is no proper introduction of the characters or the situations they are in. The animation is wonderful, however, and it is certainly worth a look. The dvd consists of two 30 minute episodes and there is no accompanying material. So you are not getting much for the price!",994032000,2,523,4.574468085106383

8067201,1,B0009V1YSW,I really wanted some man on man action.  But right from the start it is a let down.  I wish I could get my money back just for bad acting and ugly animation.  I love any kind of sex... but there was not a lot of sex at all and the acting was painful.  Not to mention the voices chosen for this... blah,1371600000,,301,3.7301587301587302
8067202,5,B0009V1YSW,I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love this movies. I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.,1355184000,,158,4.3
8067203,4,B0009V1YSW,I found it to be a very enjoyable anime story with just the right amount of homoerotic undertones. I will be looking forward to buying titles from this publisher in the future.,1252108800,,176,4.53125
8067204,5,B0009V1YSW,"A brilliant anime and true to the book, great graphics, my only irritation with some of it is the speed of the subtitles which can appear and disappear quite fast at times. Apart from that I'm glad I've got it and look forward to getting other volumes in the future.",1185235200,,266,4.34
8067205,5,B0009V1YSW,"I was skeptical about this yaoi. My cuz bought it and I decided to check it out since he didn't want to watch it alone. Wow, it's funny and romantic at times. I'm glad i watched it!",1131321600,5,181,3.918918918918919

8067207,5,B0009V1YSW,"I lucked out last year & bought the fansub. I've never even heard the English version, but as so few dubbs are good, I don't care to either.
If you think these are funny, wait till Kizuna 3 comes out. I've heard that it might already be on this DVD thing, but as it was fansubbed for a convention late last year, I doubt it.
BUY THE MANGA SERIES. IT'S OVER 11 BOOKS LONG & IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER! (so does the art^_~)",1011744000,4,418,4.048192771084337
8067208,4,B0009V1YSW,"Don't listen to people who say that the Kizuna OAV is difficult to follow. All the information that you need is presented plainly, and the backstory is told through flashbacks. The story of Enjoji and Ranmaru's love enduring despite obstacles is very touching, and a nice change from the ""doomed love"" theme of some other yaoi anime. The characters are all well-developed for such a short OAV (two half-hour episodes), and the relationships between them are well-described.
The only problem I had with this DVD was in the structure of the DVD itself. The subtitling timing is WAY off, often appearing well before the character speaks, or in the middle of a different character's lines. Unless you listen closely it is sometimes impossible to know who is saying what. Also, there are no extras, no alternate soundtracks, and no scene access on this particular version of the DVD. All you get is two OAV episodes with Japanese voices and rather large white subtitling.",1005091200,26,966,4.932515337423313
