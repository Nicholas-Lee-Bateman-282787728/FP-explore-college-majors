Richard Hoagland has a great way of presenting the ""Case  for the Face"" and although Hoagland's Mars Vol 2 and Vol 3 are better  because they include the latest (up to their release) information and are  more expertly produced, the first in the series is not to be missed.  As a  ""primer"" on the Mars Face this video is excellent.",941241600,2,411,4.561643835616438
