2759425,5,B000N6UHKE,"I have had the privilege of taking this instructor's class in North Hollywood, CA and I must say it was an exhilirating workout session. So I was not at all disappointed by the Chair Aerobics. His enthusiatic personality and award winning smile engages the participant and makes them feel empowered to complete the chair exercises. This video is great not only for those confined to a chair to do exercises but also those who would like a change of pace in their workout regimen. I recommend it to EVERYONE who believes in taking care of their body in fun and in health.",1185062400,10,570,4.598039215686274

2759427,5,B000N6UHKE,Fun and a good workout. We use this at a day program I used to attend and everyone enjoyed it. Not too strenuous but gets you moving.,1478390400,,133,3.962962962962963
2759428,4,B000N6UHKE,"I was unsure about buying this video, but like other reviews have said, it's actually pretty good. David Stamps is friendly, energetic, and motivating throughout the video. It is filmed obviously amatuer, with a folding chair and a sheet hanging behind the guy, but that really doesn't matter for this type of video.
I found that I do break a little sweat when doing this, though it is literally all upper body punching, no movement from the waist down at all. I have a knee injury which is keeping me from standing and exercising, so finding a way to still be active while sitting is a good thing!
I have been doing this most days for a couple weeks and I feel like my arms are getting some tone to them, which is great, but I do wish that there was more turning at the waist, and more varied moves than the few simple punches mixed into different sets.
I've started doing the workout with small hand weights for added benefit.
All in all, it's a pretty fun workout if you need to be active while sitting. The pace is fast enough so that 30-40 minutes goes by quickly, and because he has a nice personality and manner, doing this video repeatedly is not irritating. He talks and motivate enough, not too much.
Also the punches are very easy to learn and follow. i'm not particularly coordinated, so I think it would be easy for most people.",1471132800,2,1341,4.433198380566802
2759429,5,B000N6UHKE,"This one is the best  chair aerobics I have found. Excellent rhythmic music  allows  precise and enthusiastic  movement. This one is even better that  David's aerobic  salsa video which is also very good.
I hope he continue making other chair  aerobics videos  since there are so few good ones in the market. I'm surprised of  how many movement  and aerobic possibilities we can have having our core firm seated to prevent pain for people with spine hips etc difficulties only moving the arms and legs in a very fun dancing  way.  Great, thanks David and the whole team",1467331200,2,569,4.6938775510204085
2759430,5,B000N6UHKE,"After a major ankle injury-and looking at 4 months plus of no more running, hiking or aerobic exercise-I came across this dvd.
Easy to follow, fun and fast paced. Got my heart rate pumping and kept me moving. Is it going to replace a serious workout? No...but
way better than sitting around doing nothing while i heal. Also liked chair salsa! Give it a try if you need to be off your feet or are
just starting out. Fun!",1466467200,2,419,4.3164556962025316

2759435,5,B000N6UHKE,"I was looking for aerobic workout while my ankle heals, and figured I try this.  I love the boxing moves, this is new to me.  I do break a sweat and hope will help tone my arms.  Some reviewers complain about the sound, but I don't have an issue with it.  I was more concerned with the workout than the video quality, its fine for me.  When my ankle heals I will likely do the work out standing because I enjoy it.

He keeps you moving and it's different than regular exercise videos. I like the way he is upbeat and encouraging. And the other thing I like is that he counts down so you know what is coming up and when you will be done. I thought it was fun. I want to do it every day. I am confined to a wheel chair so I can't exercise the regular way. Chair boxing rocks. It gets my heart rate up as much as any other workout tape.",1437609600,3,538,3.7280701754385963
2759437,4,B000N6UHKE,"I am a serious runner who currently has a broken right ankle and am confined to a cast. I am in the process of restructuring my training routine to fit my limitations. I turned to the Chair Aerobics series in search of some cardio that I can do at home. I am reviewing each of these workouts that I have tried. Hopefully my reviews will help others who are in my position, and need to know whether these workouts will help them meet their goals.

While this particular workout is not my favorite, I do like it and will continue to use it. The instructor is very easy to follow. The workout requires no props and is entirely done seated (according to several customer reviews, some of the other CA workouts require equipment and include standing exercises that the product description does not disclose). Naturally, it is heavy on upper body movements and lower body integration is present but minimal. Because of this, you really have to work hard to make those movements count, thus you will likely experience some upper body fatigue (I did). That's not a bad thing, but you might want to be judicious about choosing this workout on a day you plan to do some lifting. I wear a wrist-based Fitbit, and I am very pleased that this workout credits Active minutes, and knocks out several thousand ""steps.""

I like the ""Chair Salsa"" workout better, but that is just a matter of personal preference. Variety is important, and I will continue to use both workouts. I can't say I think that these workouts alone will be sufficient to meet my goals. I will have to use weight machines and a rower as often as I can manage (unfortunately, I am dependent on others to drive me places). But this workout definitely has its place in my regimen and I recommend it.

2759445,5,B000N6UHKE,"David Stamps is super fun!  He is a really great instructor who motivates but keeps it fun and is very focused on your health and safety: he emphasizes stopping to get a drink, doing only the exercises that don't hurt, and working out as often as possible without injuring yourself.  I also have his salsa chair video and it's a little more fun, but this is great too. It's very ""low tech"", a simple cloth backdrop and the sound is not great, but who cares if it get you moving and having fun.  I worked up a sweat and feel great. I have joint issues that keep me from standing and am a very curvy lady on top of that, so this is a great way to keep moving without doing any damage to my body.",1413936000,3,693,4.080882352941177

I wore weighted gloves and worked up a good sweat and it was enjoyable,even though I usually don't like boxing style workouts. My arms were so sore the next day. Now that I'm getting older and seem to get exercise injuries more often,it's nice to know there are workouts I can do while seated and still feel like I excercised.",1410480000,,493,4.311827956989247

2759455,3,B000N6UHKE,"I ordered the online version of this boxing workout for $10, and I'm happy with it for that price. (The DVD costs $25 and I think I'd be disappointed had I paid that much.) I agree that the sound quality is poor. As for the workout itself, the instructor is motivating and I got a good sweat so I'm satisfied. I enjoy boxing, but only the upper body exercises since I have a bad knee and can't handle the lower body exercises. I liked the punching exercises, and will likely add hand weights to make them more challenging. I can also see myself doing the exercises standing up. Overall, I'm glad I found a boxing workout I can do that won't mess up my knee, thanks!",1387756800,2,665,4.285714285714286
2759456,5,B000N6UHKE,"It is a decent workout for someone with an injured foot.  I have used another one but it was boring and not very good. I like his personality and if you use arm weights you can make it harder,",1386374400,,192,3.923076923076923
2759457,4,B000N6UHKE,"I am currently recovering from knee surgery and going through a lengthly non/partial weight bearing period.  I needed a form of cardio workout.  I LOVED the instructor.  His cueing was first rate and made everything very easy to follow.  He was enthusiastic and encouraging.  In terms of workout level, the routine did get my heart rate up, but I was not dripping in sweat like I normally do when I workout.  I don't think it's necessarily a reflection a quality of the routine but rather the fact that it is difficult to get a good cardio workout without using the large muscles in your legs.  A few words of caution: I was locked in extension for a few weeks.  To do this video, you need to be able to sit comfortably and rotate your torso.  I was not able to do that while I was locked in extension.  Also, since there is a lot of twisting, I probably would not recommend this to someone who has back issues.  BTW, this routine seems to target the obliques (side of the abs) quite a bit.",1380931200,2,990,4.355191256830601
2759458,2,B000N6UHKE,"I wish more outfits would put out chair workouts.  There are so few.  This one had such potential.  David Stamps is adorable and energetic.  He makes a couple of funny jokes.  His form looks good and his instructions are clear.  I would like to work out to his DVD's, but the sound quality is so poor I have to strain to hear and understand him over the music.  I had to knock down a few stars for that reason alone because it really detracts from the enjoyment level and neither one of us ever truly wants to do the workout because of it.  There are better quality, free youtube workouts (sparkpeople and Jessica Smith both have chair workouts on there).",1375315200,4,655,4.4

I felt this is a great workout for anyone with a temporary or permanent disability for staying in shape, or at least get the heart pumping.  I have only used this a couple of times, but I enjoyed it. The music is lively, but not real hokie like some videos.  I could see after a while it could get stale, but I hope my leg gets stronger where I can do my regular exercise regimen.  David is a positive teacher, and his likeability factor is great.  Not in an egotistical kind of way, but very nice.

2759461,5,B000N6UHKE,"I am a runner who was sidelined by a broken foot. David Stamps kept me sane, between this ans his Chair Salsa I was able to exercise and actually lose weight while not being able to run. He is a great instructor. I often did both videos back to back to get a longer  workout. I will keep the DVD even though I am back to running, it is FUN! he is a very motivating guy, and this workout is suitable for anyone who can't stand.

2759462,5,B000N6UHKE,"I broke my foot and am unable to do my usual walking, jogging, and circuit training.  I was bored of just using hand weights and wanted a new challenge.  This workout is great because it is geared toward all levels.  It is broken up into smaller workouts so you can choose which workout you would like to do or do all of them for a longer/ more challenging workout.  I only did the intro and the first session on my first try and I was sweating.  The trainer is very likable and engaging which is definitely a perk for a workout video.",1370390400,,535,4.205882352941177
2759463,5,B000N6UHKE,"This is a fun upper body workout if you like boxing.  It's done totally in the chair and you work your abs throughout the program.  I've done this workout about 4 times now and I notice that I like it more each time.  I'm wearing an orthopedic walking boot so I needed something that wouldn't bother my leg.  For now, it's a perfect option for me.  I like to use this video on my cardio days and I have another workout with weights that I use.  This DVD comes with a full workout and a quick workout.  I've only done the full workout so far.  The music is okay and fits the workout.

Update: June 22, 2013.  I am no longer in my walking boot, but this workout is more fun then ever, I love it.  I originally gave 4 stars because of the background but am upgrading to 5 stars.  There is a noticeable improvement in my waistline.

2759465,5,B000N6UHKE,"I have artificial knees and jumping around is not recommended.  It can be hard to find a video that will get my cardio up.  This one does it well.  I enjoyed the presenter.  I do this while seated on a fitball.  Bouncing while I do it increases the cardio even more, without hurting my knees.  Working with a trainer I have determined that I need a larger fitball than the size usually recommended in the tables.  If you have bad knees a key thing is to have your knee angle while seated a little more than 90 degrees.

2759466,5,B000N6UHKE,"This work out dvd has been a lifesaver. I tore my calf muscle in my beloved jazzercise class and needed a workout that didn't use the lower body for 8 wks. This dvd isn't the most intense exercise I've done but considering you only use your upper body it is a fairly good workout. I was sore in my arms, back and especially my abs after using this the first time. It really engages your core muscles. If you need a sitting workout this is worth a try. The back drop and camera work isn't top notch but I'm more concerned with a great workout. Does require some twisting so be careful if you have low back issues.",1360108800,,612,4.194915254237288

While I can walk and exercise with the prosthesis, my work-outs aren't quite as thorough as they are if I take the leg off and focus on exercising in a chair.

I really like this guy, I plan on buying more videos with him in them. This is the kind of video for someone who really enjoys being active but actually likes doing something different every now and then. Crunches and sit ups get boring after a while so take a break from them and box.

Plus, it gets a lot of frustrations out. :)",1357516800,9,647,4.007751937984496

2759470,5,B000N6UHKE,"I have a birth defect in my legs which keeps me from standing comfortably for more than a few minutes.  It also keeps me from being able to do all the toe pointing and leg movements which are found in so many other seated exercise videos.  This video has been just perfect for me.  The instructor is very upbeat and (as noted by another reviewer) absolutely adorable - and you have to admire the enthusiasm he puts into flinging his body side to side!  His enthusiasm makes the video fun, and somehow his comments (""Are you breathing? Of course you are!"") always seem to come at just the right time.

The first time I used it, I was so out of shape that I was only able to get through the warmup and first set.  But I worked my way up and now do the video daily. I bought a set of one-pound weights to add to the workout, and plan to use a balance ball to add to the workout.  These aren't necessary, however - an armless dining chair or a stool will do fine.  I have an elevated meditation stool, and use that. Staying balanced on the stool while leaning so far over gives a mild workout to the thighs, which pleases my doctor as well.

EDITED TO ADD:  I thought it might be useful to others to have a little more information about the video itself.  The video is divided into sets.  The first is simply an explanation of the various punches (there's only about 4 - it's not complicated) and an opportunity to practice them.  After the first couple of times watching the video, I just began to skip over that part.  The next part begins at 3:00 and is a few minutes of warming up.  It reaches a fairly intense level of exercise itself, so I always include it.  Then come several sets (I think there's a total of four, plus a cool down section) with a break between each one so you have a good place to stop if you need to get a drink or take a breather.  For me, the first three gradually come together to to a pretty intense aerobic level by set three, and then the fourth is less aerobic.  The exercises all use the same punches you were taught previously, just in different arrangements, such as high and low punches to the side rather than just a jab to the front.  Almost every exercise includes armwork, of course, but this video also focuses a lot on the waist, with a lot of turning at the waist and leaning over sideways, so someone with balance issues should be aware of this before attempting.  The final section is a cool down section with relaxation and muscle stretches.  Personally, while I always do the warmup, I usually skip the cool down - just because I'm an impatient sort.  This can be a really good workout - but since it's on video rather than in person, there's no instructor to call you out if you slack off. You'll get out of it what you put into it.

I should probably add that I purchased the Amazon Instant Video edition.  This makes it easy to get around in the video - OTOH I don't have any idea what navigation is like with the DVD version.

Before the injury I was running and doing yoga on a daily basis.  I have tried out a number of workout videos, chair dancing and chair yoga, and this series is the best!  It keeps you active and building muscles.  I think it is the closest thing to a regular workout you can find if you are stuck in a chair.  I highly recommend this series, especially the Boxing, for people of all ages and fitness levels.",1284854400,11,566,3.9734513274336285
2759477,5,B000N6UHKE,This video has been wonderful for me. I have been on bed rest for over a month and doing this exercise cheers me up and makes me feel like I am not losing all my muscle tone. It is a great length for me- recovering from surgery...I would suggest rewinding it and going through the last 3 combos for a longer workout. The instructor makes me smile! He has a fantastic (adorably goofy) personality.,1277942400,6,396,4.364864864864865
2759478,4,B000N6UHKE,I was very pleased with this video and the workout. I have knee and ankle problems which make it difficult for me to do a lot of floor work. I actually broke a sweat and felt good after completing the workout. I would like to buy more of these programs.,1268265600,2,253,4.08
2759479,1,B000N6UHKE,"I bought this DVD with the hope of getting a good workout.  Although you get plenty of upper body exercise with various twists, punches & turns, you don't get ANY lower body exercise.  A surprise to me since boxers have to be light on their feet.  It was a BIG disappointment!  Even watching/exercising with it the first time I was bored.  Also, those with back problems beware.  There is a lot of twisting involved.

The sound quality is poor, as if it was recorded in the trainer's basement or garage.  I found this to be the case with the Chair Circuit Training DVD as well.

In the past I purchased the Chair Aerobics and the Chair Circuit training DVD's made by the same company that produced this DVD.  Out of the three the ""Chair Aerobics"" is the best.""

I'm not very impressed with the company that produces this series of exercise DVDs.
All in all, I would not recommend this DVD.  I don't plan on ever using it again.",1266624000,4,927,4.420118343195266
2759480,4,B000N6UHKE,"I am two weeks post Achilles rupture repair surgery, and this DVD was awesome!  I was fairly fit before my injury and this dvd made me sweat.  Since I am non-weight-bearing on my left leg, it was perfect.  It's not only a great upper body workout, he's got some core work in there, as well.  I did take off one star for the cheese-mo backdrop ;-)",1245110400,,346,4.196969696969697
2759481,3,B000N6UHKE,"I recently had foot surgery and am unable to stand on my feet for a long period of time or do high impact exercises. My usual workouts consist of running and P90X DVD's so I am fairly athletic.  This video works well for someone who does have a physical handicap in their legs or feet which prevents them from standing much if at all.  It works the upper body and abs. Obviously there isn't much being done to the lower body in terms of toning. One complaint for me is that the video wasn't long enough. I was just beginning to sweat when it was almost over! I could have kept going for sure. I am used to a much more intense and difficult workout though so maybe this is perfect for someone just starting their exercise routine.  All in all, a decent video for someone like me recovering from an injury who's used to being active and doesn't want to just sit all day feeling helpless as far as working out goes.",1234137600,30,912,4.2601156069364166
2759482,5,B000N6UHKE,"For those of us who are too old to be jumping around anymore and who have limited space, this is a great cardio and core workout -- sitting down.  David Stamps is fun.  Once you get the moves down you can increase your effort and feel like you have just run a fast mile without ever leaving your seat.  My mother and I alternate Chair Boxing and Chair Salsa every day.  And she is 86 years old!",1226966400,,394,4.077922077922078
2759483,5,B000N6UHKE,I recently had ankle surgery on both feet and am unable to do standing exercises. This DVD was just what I needed! The instructor is very engaging and keeps you from getting bored. I was skeptical about being able to burn calories while seated but I definitely worked up a sweat. Having the option of a full (approx. 35 mins) or quick workout is also a plus. Highly recommend this product.,1217894400,3,389,4.492957746478873
2759484,5,B000N6UHKE,"Following major knee surgery, I was unable to do traditional aerobic exercise as I was ordered not to put any weight on my leg.  What a relief that I found this workout DVD!  I did it right in my wheelchair with a full cast on my leg and still lost weight and toned up.  The instructor does a great job of moving the viewer through traditional boxing moves at a pace that makes you break a sweat and burn calories--all the while sitting on your duff!  The instructor, David Stamps, is very pleasant, enthusiastic, and easy on the eyes as well.  There are 2 workouts on the DVD--one is a longer workout designed for maximum muscle toning and calorie burning, the other is a quick workout for when you may not have the time, or want a lighter workout.  Both workouts made me break a sweat!  I also feel like I could defend myself with the new boxing moves I learned.  Thank you David Stamps for  making this video--don't know what I'd have done without ya.",1205712000,29,954,4.375
2759485,5,B000N6UHKE,"This dvd is a great work out and so much fun!  The instructor keeps you motivated, explains things very well and is encouraging all the way through.  I have A LOT of weight to get rid of and have limited mobility.  I've tried a lot of the other sit and be fit dvds, but this is the one I keep coming back to. It's the only one I have found so far that really makes me feel like I'm working out and gets me sweating.  Besides, how much fun is it to feel like you're punching the weight off!  It might not be great for anyone with osteo problems but other than that I think just about anyone could do this workout.",1199836800,24,612,3.9836065573770494

8175398,5,B000N6UHKE,"Really good workout with no lower body impact.  I have problems with my hips, so keeping fit is hard at home if you don't have a pool.  David is really personable and encouraging.  Not a whole lot of fanfare, but a really well thought-out workout for those of us who still want to get activity.  Thank you David!",1521072000,,312,4.327586206896552
8175399,4,B000N6UHKE,"I bought this DVD because of activity restrictions due to plantar fasciitis and bunion surgery. It is pricey for the video quality, but the quality is fine. I'm 66 and out of condition, so even though the workout is seated, it was fast for me. My son solved the problem by turning on the advanced controls of my VLC media player. This allows me to slow down the playback to suit my level of fitness. If you are in good condition, this may not be very challenging, but it's better than sitting in a chair and eating cookies while your injury heals. There is a warm-up, full routine, and stretching cool down. Stamps is personable and easy to follow.",1518652800,,648,4.453781512605042

8175401,5,B000N6UHKE,I bought this DVD a few years ago and it was stolen (with other things).  Finally got a new one and the Amazon video for when I travel.  I definitely work up a sweat but it takes a few combos to do it.  Also Mr. Stamps is just fun to watch.  Love his energy and enthusiasm...,1501459200,,275,3.857142857142857

8175404,5,B000N6UHKE,"Actually a pretty good upper body workout, especially with hand weights.  For a runner/biker looking for a break on the knees, this workout works great.  I use light hand weights to up the resistance and I do feel it in my shoulders and abs.  I am thinking I am going to try using it on long car rides to get a workout in- when I am not driving of course!",1490918400,,355,4.042857142857143
8175405,5,B000N6UHKE,I injured my knee and I was unable to endure a small walk without serious pain.  This video was perfect for getting my heart rate up.  It also helping towards my effort to lose weight.  Someone mentioned the low quality of the video.  I have seen high end video that didn't offer what I needed.  This one did.  I don't care if he filmed it in his mother's basement I am just happy to have it. He does an excellent job of explaining the moves.  When I was done I was sweating. Something sit and fit never got me to.  I love this video and will be buying his other videos.  David keep of the good work.  You have a calling and I am glad you fulfilled it.,1485561600,2,652,4.0234375
