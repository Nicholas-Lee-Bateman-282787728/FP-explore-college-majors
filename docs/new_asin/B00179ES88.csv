8265492,4,B00179ES88,"Released in 2007, a Tamil-language Indian film ""Sivaji"" stars Rajinikanth as Sivaji Arumugam, an idealistic millionaire who has just come back from America to his hometown Chennai, India. To help the community's poor people, Sivaji decides to provide free medical service and education by building a hospital and a university, but his project is continually thwarted by bureaucracy, corrupt officials and a local influential figure Adiseshan (Suman).

Directed by S. Shankar, who went on to helm the same star's mega-hit ""Enthiran,"" ""Sivaji"" is a fine piece of entertainment that has a few serious messages about the society it depicts. Those who expect the incredible action sequences of ""Enthiran"" (and army of robots) might be disappointed at the film's first half that is rather light on action, but keep watching. ""Sivaji"" gets better as the story goes on, with a few nice action set-pieces in the second half.

""Sivaji"" also works as a comedy with the inimitable Rajinikanth showing his great comedic skills. Sivaji falls in love with a girl Tamizhselvi (Shriya Saran), and to marry her, Sivaji follows the advice of his well-meaning but officious uncle (Vivek, just brilliant). A.R. Rahman's songs and musical sequences are also impressive with uniquely choreographed dancing.

Some of the film's cultural references (including the title that reminds us of the star Rajinikanth's real name Shivaji Rao Gaekwad) may be lost on you (the film's ""trivia"" found at the internet site imdb is helpful), but even so, ""Sivaji"" is an enjoyable three-hour ride full of comedy, musical and action.",1354924800,,1592,5.25984251968504
