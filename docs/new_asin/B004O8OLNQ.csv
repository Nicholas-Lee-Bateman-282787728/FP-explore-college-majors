4436842,3,B004O8OLNQ,"Have to agree with others that this has more instructional value than entertainment value.  As a parent, I found it hard to watch even though the most explicit scenes are of ad copy the father works with.  Young women often do not understand how quickly the power they yield can entrap them.  This wouldn't be easy to watch with a daughter, but might help create an awareness of the cause and effect of such a situation.  Abusers are often trusted adults, but what is also hit on here is that girlish fantasy is far removed from the reality of rape.",1311811200,,549,4.46
4436843,2,B004O8OLNQ,"This is a good movie for parents to show there teens.  But for the general public it is lacking.  It reminded me of those old made for tv movie that teach kids a lesson.  Lesson on drug use, or peer pressure, ect. Now with the internet an preditors this movie arrives.  Sorry did not like it.",1311724800,5,292,4.160714285714286
4436844,5,B004O8OLNQ,This movie was excellent. It is clear that the writers did their research. They clearly showed how innocently girls (and don't forget boys) can be slowly pulled into something like this. I have not seen a movie this well directed and casted in a long while dealing with this topic. It's a shame I did not hear more about this film while it was in theaters. I hope you will watch this film and even better I hope you will have your friends watch this film.,1311724800,2,455,4.3023255813953485
4436845,5,B004O8OLNQ,"""People get hurt, there's only so much we can do to protect ourselves, our children.  The only thing we can do is we can be there for each other when we fall down to pick each other up.""  After months and months of chatting on an internet room Annie decides to meet ""Charlie"".  When she discovers he is not who he says he is her life and the life of her family is changed forever.  This is a movie that needs to be seen by everyone, especially those with kids.  The movie will stick with you long after its over, as it should.  This movie is very disturbing on so many levels, the most disturbing being the scene during the end credits.  Everyone that watches this will be able to relate to at least one character.  This is the most realistic account of this problem that I have ever seen, and may help you to recognize the signs.  Once again this is a blaring example of how a movie without effects and explosions are not promoted like they should be because of the lack of earning potential, due to the serious subject matter.  When a movie like this only makes $100,000 while a movie like ""Arthur"" makes $33,000,000 there is a serious problem.  The fact that Hollywood would rather promote an unnecessary remake starring Russel Brand then a movie that could actually help someone is awful and whoever is in charge of this needs to take a look at what they are doing.  That's the end of my rant...sorry about that.  Overall, a powerful and important movie.  Please please please watch this movie.  I give it an A+.

Would I watch again? - I don't know if I could make it through again, but I would if it meant that someone would watch it who other wise wouldn't

The Film 4/5

Director David Schwimmer is best known for his portrayal of Ross on Friends, but Trust shows that he's also a talented director. The film deals with rape and it's a subject close to Schwimmer's heart. He's on the board of directors of the Rape Foundation for the Rape Treatment Center of Santa Monica. His passion for the subject shows in the sympathetic way he handles some potentially awkward scenes.

The story focuses on a 14-year-old girl named Annie (Liberato). She's a typical teen on the surface, worrying about how she is perceived at school and hoping to be popular. Like most children in today's world, she spends a lot of time on the Internet and using her phone. We are frequently shown her text messages on the screen and the replies she gets. Her closest online friend is Charlie, who claims to be two years older than her. He gives her good advice and she trusts him.

As the story progresses, Charlie reveals that he's 20 years old; then he amends that to 25. When he shows up without warning to meet her in the mall, she can see that he's closer to 40 than 25. Although she's initially dismayed, Charlie manages to gain her confidence. She gets in his car and the pair end up in a hotel room. The inevitable sexual encounter follows.

When Annie tells her friend what happened, her friend feels compelled to tell the school principal the story. The police and FBI are called in and investigate the sexual assault. Annie doesn't see it that way and thinks that she's in love with Charlie and that he understands her. Annie's parents, Will (Owen) and Lynn (Keener), are shocked that their daughter has been raped by a sexual predator. Will starts doing some research of his own and finds out that several sexual offenders live close to his family and he's appalled.

The film deals with the reactions of Annie's family and her friends at school. The situation is affecting her relationships with everyone and tearing her parents apart. Will is consumed by the knowledge and it affects his marriage, work, and his relationship with Annie. Clive Owen is at his best and shows that he has considerable range. Keener is always good and she's also convincing.

Annie's character is the most important role and Liberato pulls it off superbly. She shows her vulnerability and innocence, but also her determination, and she's convinced that she knows better than those trying to protect her. We see her in therapy with Gail (Davis), and the two are utterly convincing. Schwimmer has assembled a cast that is more than up to the task of handling the controversial subject matter.

I have gone into a lot of detail, but I'm leaving a lot of things out as I don't want to reveal all of the film's secrets.

This isn't a typical Hollywood story where everything is wrapped up neatly. The issues are real and some characters and relationships suffer permanent damage. What matters is that this story is told. The Internet is a wonderful resource, but there will always be those who seek to use it to exploit other people. Hopefully, some parents and teens will see the film and increase their awareness of potential dangers.

When I watch Trust, I'm reminded of Stanley Kubrick's Lolita. The two films were shot fifty years apart and the world is a very different place today, but there are similarities. An Education also deals with similar issues and was set in the same time period as Lolita, but Trust provides a timely update in a world in which technology has advanced dramatically.

Put yourself in Will's position and think about what you would do. Trust is a gripping emotional drama with an important message. I found myself captured by the story after a few minutes and I couldn't look away from the screen. Fans of emotional dramas set in the real world will probably appreciate Schwimmer's thought-provoking cautionary tale.

Video Quality 3.5/5
Trust looks a little disappointing on Blu-ray. The colors appear accurate and the image is clean and bright, but detail isn't up to the standard expected of a modern release. Facial details are lacking and the entire image looks soft for most of the running time. It's not exactly bad, and likely won't be distracting, but there's certainly room for improvement.

Audio Quality 4/5
Trust is a story that's driven by dialogue and it comes across clearly. The English TrueHD 5.1 mix delivers a competent track that is suitable for the mood of the film.

Special Features 2/5

The additional features appear in HD.

The Story of Trust (16:44) - The cast and crew talk about the film.

Interviews with Cast and Crew (13:43) - Repeats much of what was said in the opening feature.

Behind the Scenes (3:19) - Showing a few scenes being filmed.

Trust does a lot of things well. Schwimmer makes some good choices and draws good performances from the excellent cast. The pacing feels right and the importance of the story gives the film additional weight. Liberato's performance is well worth seeing and seems incredibly real. Fans of Clive Owen's action roles might not enjoy this as it's a totally different type of film. If you like emotional drama, Trust is worth your time. The Blu-ray presentation is a little disappointing, but doesn't detract from the story.

At the time of writing, Amazon.com's price is just $13.99.

4436847,5,B004O8OLNQ,"First off I usually hate to write reviews before a product is released, However after seeing this movie I have to do so. I will be coming back and reviewing the Blu Ray quality once it is released so do not worry! Now for the Movie....

This movie is about a young girl who is the victim of an internet predator, I seriously do not want to give anything about this movie out it hits HARD. The acting on both Clive Owens part and Liana Liberato are amazing. At times I wanted to cry for her and at others I could not even watch, Clive Owen brings so much realism to his role as a father it really got to me being a father and all I recommend this movie to any parent and teenager.

Child Predators come in all forms and I really think this movie could help parents recognize things going on around them. Teenagers could also learn from this movie, It is a serious problem and the movie did such a well job showing so.

EDIT
So I have watched the Blu Ray release now and Must say it is not what I was expecting, Do not get me wrong it was great just not as good as most modern blu ray releases. The Audio was good the video was a bit lacking the darks a bit uneven, only two extras that are movie related regardless, It is still a must own and I recommend it to all.",1308960000,92,1264,4.027888446215139
4436848,3,B004O8OLNQ,"Parents should definitely keep track of what their children do on the internet and one of the ways in doing that is to disable most of the crap that's on it. Or not giving them a computer at all, and there are ways to monitor what goes on in the cyber world. You can't really protect and shelter them from the world even though we'd like to. The movie does touch base very well on the concept behind sexual predators online. But it really seems to lack capturing the real feel and emotional damage that it does. Clive Owen is a great actor, but this role seems all wrong for him, as it does with the young girl Annie. It's just very slow paced(to slow pace) about a subject that is very serious. Also the girl seems to actually be in favor of protecting the man who assaulted her in the fist place. In a way it kind of portrays teenage girls as being stupid and naive. I imagine that most kids today if confronted with an older man that they meet offline, they would say omg, you sick pervert etc. That's one of the reasons the movie just doesnt go anywhere. I was expecting more of a stalker situation, who wouldn't leave the girl alone, but instead you get a slow paced bunch of talk, and very little tension. So while Trust isn't horrible, is certainly doesnt break any new ground, and will become a Lifetime Special at best. I think it's a bold brave step for David Shcwimmer to direct a movie such as this, but i also think it will be his last.",1308182400,4,1449,4.253623188405797
4436849,5,B004O8OLNQ,"Forget what you know about the clichs of online predators. Forget what you've seen on shows like Dateline or Oprah. And I challenge you: Go ahead and go into this movie with a preconceived notion on its premise. This movie will baffle you on how complex the human spirit is. Yes, the girl meets a guy older than her from the Internet across the country. But no, it will be nothing of what you think the outcome will be.

Humans are incredibly complex and this honest film delves into the psychology of a functioning family like nothing I've seen. Once you think the movie will take one step deeper, it takes three. Once you believe one surprise is coming, three do. The acting: wonderful. The writing: (literally) breathtaking. The overall composition of the piece: riveting. Its brilliance should be watched by any boy or girl or father or mother or man or woman from ages 10 to dead. I guarantee that you will not be able to get the film out of your thoughts for at least a few days. You'll understand right when you put it into your DVD player.",1303776000,114,1047,4.481675392670157
4436850,5,B004O8OLNQ,"Trust is one of those films that every one should see.
It sparks conversations long after you leave the theater about the internet, family values, relationships and how one incident can change the future.  It is realistic and as a woman, I sat there going ""yep- I can see myself doing that.""

The acting is amazing... Clive Owen and Catherine Keener are at the top of their game, yet it is newcomer Liana Liberto who grabs your heart and doesn't let go.

This one is sad but VERY true and it happens every day. I had my daughters watch this fast forwarding through a couple parts.. great acting and good story line. Also people do not hide stories like this from your children ALL ages need to know about stories like this because younger and younger nowadays kids are getting hurt because in my opinion parents worry their kids are too young well they are NEVER too young.. infants sadly get hurt share the story people and this is one good one to have them watch since the rape isn't really detailed in my opinion just watch it first to see if there are spots you shouldn't let them see there are a couple.,1470009600,3,782,4.29054054054054

4436890,5,B004O8OLNQ,"The wild isn't the only place where predators prowl.  Human predators have found their sweet spot on the internet, and those twisted individuals have developed ingenious strategies to inveigle and ensnare their young, gullible, prey.

""Trust"" will have the viewer pinned to his or her seat, particularly parents of vulnerable children, an oxymoron in itself.  All children are vulnerable, even kids with good, loving, attentive parents.  Such is the case in ""Trust,"" a movie that follows the progression of  deception used by a pedophile in order to violate his next victim.  Annie, the well-adjusted, obedient child of Will and Lynn, has given her parents no reason to be suspicious.  She is a young teen with wholesome interests and normal friends.  She eats dinner with her family each night, does her homework, and gets along well with her parents, particularly her father.  All of that changes, however, when Annie meets a boy named, ""Charlie,"" in an internet chat room, with whom she enters into a clandestine, but increasingly intense, online relationship.

As the movie continues, Annie becomes aware of Charlie's lies concerning his age.  Although she finds these fibs disconcerting, Charlie assures her that he lied about his age to keep her interested in him. He thought she would no longer speak to him if she knew he wasn't a teenager but was, in fact, a man of 25 years old.  His ability to manipulate her is part of the  grooming process, and Annie's youth makes her the perfect target.  Charlie has even managed to convince her of the appropriateness of the age difference between them, and he has tailored his conversation and style of speech to simulate that of a younger person.  In time, he has drawn Annie into his lair to the point where she can think of nothing or no one else. Indeed, puppy love is very real for a 14-year-old.

Annie grows more secretive and introverted as her internet and cellphone relationship with the pedophile develop, which cause consternation in her father. This girl seems like a stranger to him.  As Annie becomes less conversant with her parents, she grows more dependent on her daily communications with Charlie and more committed to keeping details of their relationship private. This parallel trajectory on which Charlie and young Annie are traveling ultimately arrives at a disturbing and dramatic turning point.  Revolting yet intriguing, this scene represents the pedophile's final conquest, the patience he must possess in order to achieve it, and the susceptible, malleable quality inherent in the young, making a predator's objective that much easier.

The final scene in the movie, despite its brevity and lack of dialogue, broadcasts with stunning accuracy the child predator's need to maintain disparate identities as a way to avoid detection.

Clive Owen's magnificent portrayal of a father processing the reality of his daughter's victimization, along with Liana Liberato and Catherine Keener as Annie and her mother, respectively, bring  to life the emotions that run amok when child exploitation occurs within a family.

The cautionary byline to the movie, ""Trust,"" is a simple one:  Exercise vigilance in supervising your child's internet and cell phone usage, and in acquiring the identities and details of online ""friends.""  Not everyone is who he says he is.  Children - your children - will cry, ""foul,"" asserting their rights to privacy, but all indications in a high-tech world suggest otherwise.  Your child's safety should always, always come before his alleged right to privacy.",1426550400,,3557,5.142608695652174

The young girl who plays Annie does an amazing job in this movie; the scene in the counselor's office where she finally comes to terms with what happened was heartbreaking.

4436912,4,B004O8OLNQ,"There's no way the NSA wouldn't have intervened if they have been able to see everything online and on phones for years so does this mean all those predator cautionary tales were just urban legends fictionalized for the public benefit?

There's no way that culturally we have enlisted men who see this on the computer and wouldn't make sure the predator got taken down - they would have tracked the culprit all the way to the top, I think.

Culturally, we just aren't like the East Germany that made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-Of-Others/dp/B000V4NX04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives Of Others</a>&nbsp;possible even if we have superior technology so we absolutely would have done something so as a comprehension aid, this movie tells us what about Edward Snowden's latest revelation that NSA employees regularly passed around private images of the surveilled?  I think it makes us aware of our limits, of our outrage in a friendly environment.

This is a very thought out story with stockholm syndrome, parental anguish and the difference in gender comprehension of what happened to their daughter, societal norms/laxness interwoven and while not preachy, you definitely get the idea that giving children boundaries make a big difference and that Jed Rubenfeld should probably write a book about ""Rape By Deception.""

Predators seeing this pre-Snowden, would take comfort at the references to parental and social shortcomings and the idea you can convince a 14 year old to not get really upset at being handled by some guy who reeks of teacher as in the dude who has to control the rowdy boys without looking foolish and not think it was awesome that her Dad wants to kill you.  The whole point of these little girls is that they aren't in a position to reject the loser in you.  But ... Teenage girls can be kind of snarky even goody goodies maybe especially goody goodies cuz of their vocabulary skills so this film might just be wishful thinking ... Pre Snowden.

As of last year, predators are on the wrong side of D Day.

This movie also includes how society compromises the rights and the harm done sexualizing girls and deduct from the crime the mere existence of natural female sexuality.

So that is why piepel is important for society's perception of the seriousness of the crime and incompromised extent of the harm done.

Because males run the world and they possess a comprehension gap if they are distracted by heterosexual interest in females.  In a piepel situation, all social distractions are stripped away.  There is only  the pedophile crime in and of itself.

You don't need a phd to go after this kind of conniving - the predator in this film tried to make his 14 year old(!!!) target an accomplice in her own assault.

I don't think we will ever be socially tolerant, socially cowed by political correctness or corrupted by umami (the taste of degradation) porn images freely available on the internet to ever lose our groundedness with regard to this type of offense.

""Since most studies have found that people tend to blame the victim of rape for the incident, a study called Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence focused on where the blame lies in rape cases. In cases of female rape victims, a higher proportion of males than females tend to blame the victim for the sexual assault. In order to show whether males or female respondents blamed the rape victim at a higher rate, this study utilized a story of a man being raped to see if the blame was placed on the victim or the assaulter. After performing the experiment, researchers found that a statistically significant proportion of males tend to blame the victim, even when the rape victim is a male.[40] This study implies that even in cases of male sexual victimization, the male victims are held responsible for the assault by the majority of the uninvolved population.""

It should be a nobrainer:

Dr. Nikita Levy was fired in February 2013, days after an employee alerted hospital authorities about her suspicions and he was forced to turn over the camera. He committed suicide ten days later. Investigators discovered roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on a series of servers in his home.

""All of these women were brutalized by this,"" said the women's lead attorney, Jonathan Schochor. ""Some of these women needed counseling, they were sleepless, they were dysfunctional in the workplace, they were dysfunctional at home, they were dysfunctional with their mates. This breach of trust, this betrayal - this is how they felt.""

4436918,2,B004O8OLNQ,"Did I see the same movie as everyone else? Normally, I'm a fan of Catherine Keener and of Clive Owen, but I didn't like either of them in this sanctimonious, ham handed movie. Clive Owen's character spends his days working as an advertising executive who never questions the exploitation of the young models in the Calvin Kline and American Apparel knockoff clothing ads he produces until a male approximately his age sees his daughter (portrayed by Liana Liberato, who has mastered scowling, but I saw no evidence that she can act) as a sexual object and seduces her, at which time Clive Owen's character is (predictably) morally outraged.  Ho hum. Catherine Keener plays the always cool mom who has a great relationship with all of her kids, including the totally-wholesome-prior-to-being-seduced-by-the-bad-man-on-the-internet 14 year old poorly portrayed by Liana Liberato. This might have been a great LifeTime movie, but it's nothing more than that, so unless you LOVE LifeTime movies, don't waste your time watching it. On the other hand, if you want to watch a great movie about a sexual predator, with a terrific actress portraying a teen (Ellen Page), rent Hard Candy.",1404000000,,1178,5.135416666666667

4436922,4,B004O8OLNQ,"Unfortunately, this happens way too often and it is a true reality. This is a bigger problem than most people realize. There is not enough police and fed agents around to monitor and enforce predators on the web. Children feel a false sense of security at home on their computers. Even worse now with kids having the same access on their smart phones.  Parents must do their part and monitor their internet activity, snoop through their stuff to ensure they are not venturing out.

4436923,5,B004O8OLNQ,"This is a remarkably well-made movie, with Oscar-caliber performances by Clive Owen as an affluent Chicago advertising executive and Liana Liberato as his teenage daughter who is seduced by an online predator. The subject matter may make this sound like an exploitative film or undesirable viewing; but this is one of the most valuable movies ever made about the effects of victimization, in large part because of the counseling scenes. Viola Davis plays the therapist, who attempts to guide a young girl away from the denial and confusion of seduction to acknowledge the painful reality that she was abused. There is not one false note among the actors, and many will be surprised that David Schwimmer, best known for his TV comedies, was the director of this masterful ensemble. In the DVD extras Davis credits Schwimmer with understanding an actor's process, and the evidence of this is abundantly clear on screen. Liberato needed to carry a large portion of this film at a young age, and she is simply astonishing in a role that any adult actor would have found daunting. Owen gives the finest performance of his career, and he should have been amply recognized for it in the 2010 awards season. Many people will shy away from this movie; but they should not: anyone who has ever felt victimized or felt helpless over a loved one's victimization will benefit from seeing this film.",1396742400,,1385,4.897872340425532

than following the formula of films like ""Taken"", with revenge the motive for all kinds of slam-bang action, this is closer to what
really happens when a 14 year old falls in love with a predator on the internet.  Extremely riveting, and exceptionally well done,
the movie instead focuses on how the parents in a very good home environment have a very difficult time dealing with their daughter's
reluctance to accept the truth, and the frustrations that are faced trying to identify and catch the predator.  If you watch this
film DO NOT stop the film at the beginning of the credits, as you will miss a very important element of surprise.  And don't listen
to ANYONE who says this is like a ""Lifetime"" film.  It is not formulaic and manipulative in its characterizations.  5 stars for a

Children, especially teenagers, are smarter than what parents think.
Hence, the foundation of the plot is absurd for these reasons: 1) a 14 year old high school freshman girl meets a guy online who she thinks is a sophomore.... 2)...then the guy admits the he is really in college (she keeps talking to him)... 3)... then the guys admits that he is a graduate student (she is still talking to him)... 4)...then they meet in person and they looks like he's 40! (she still talks to him).

Really?  No, really?

This was a .99 rental on Amazon Instant Video and I stopped the movie right there.
It was just impossible for me to believe that in the age of 'To Catch a Predator' and extensive media coverage of situations like this that a modern teenage girl wouldn't have run for dear life, or at the very least realized that the guy was a creep and ditched him.

Giving it 2 stars because of the great acting in the 30 minutes that I watched.",1344729600,,964,4.423728813559322
4436957,4,B004O8OLNQ,"Before I rent a movie on Amazon, I always start by reading the negative reviews first to find out whether the movie will be worth my while or not.  Some of the 1 star reviews of this movie say that they are mad because the girl is stupid and she almost asked for it, or the movie's end is not satisfying because justice is not served.  Judging by my grown-up stories I immediately knew that this movie might be it!  It might be realistic instead of artificially dramatic.

Watching the movie only confirmed my thoughts.  It is realistic in several ways:

(1) Young girls are the subject of sexual fantasy, and the social media does not help (like in the movie, 12-16 year old models are often used to convey sexual messages in the fashion world).  You will be surprised to see how many young girls have been improperly contacted by guys of all ages.  When I was a teenager, I have received numerous invites, suggestions, and attempts by guys in their 30s and 40s, either online or in real.  They are stealthy, and leave no trace, once they see the room for advance they will take it, and once they are firmly objected they try to make it look like you have misunderstood them.

(2)Teenagers, including virgin girls, have sexual desires.  In a frightening way, little girls may derive excitement from guys' attention and attempts, and some of them give in.  When I was a teenager, I was scared, confused but sometimes aroused when guys tried to make a move on me.  I resisted the temptation but many didn't.

(3) When we were younger, many of us were indeed foolish, as many of us care too much about others than our own safety, that the illusion of love trumps good judgment and reasoning.

(4)  A girl can be addicted to someone that listens to her, flatters her and seems to be caring and pretends to understand her instead of criticizing her.  She would believe that was real love.  We all have seen a few young girls who have crush on older guys for the same reason.  Many of these stories causes no harm to anyone, but  if the older guy takes advantage of girl's foolish crush, the story would be different.

(5) It is difficult to make someone admit that she or him is wrong, was stupid and made a bad judgment.  It is more difficult to make a rebelling teenager to admit that she's been a fool, it can be extremely difficult to make someone who has just been victimized to realize that she caused her own tragedy.  When the girl started talking back at her parents in the movie, my husband said to me that our kids would never talk to us like that, and I disagreed.  It's part of human nature.  People who grow out if it at young age are rare.  It creates a challenge for all parents who want to prevent their kids from doing stupid things.

In sum.  I say this movie is great and is a must see for parents.  I makes me revisit my earlier age and think hard about how to deal with similar situations given that a lot of dangerous situation for young girls are due to the our own human nature.  We have to understand it to address it, and denying it won't help.",1344124800,,3067,4.3674911660777385

After the 14 year old girl gets raped,the family starts looking for the preditor,and they keep looking and looking till the movie ends. When I rented this film I thought it was ganna be a movie about revenge,but I was wrong. The only thing thats good about this movie is that it proves a point.it shows teens that they shouldnt trust people that they meet online,plus it shows how some older men try to take advantage of young girls.this is the type of film that teachers should show in class,or that therapist should watch with theire young patients.

4436960,3,B004O8OLNQ,"My expectations of this film was fairly high, since the basic story sounded intriguing. The story is about a teenage girl who gets lured in and taken advantage of by a sexual predator. And it shows the aftermath on what it does to the victim's family. And while the first half of the film was decent, the second half and end result of this film left me wanting a lot more. And quite frankly, pretty bored as well. Perhaps this is a more realistic look at what families deal with when coping with victims of sexual predators, but as a movie, it was left incomplete. I felt that there was so many different ways the movie could have went that would made it so much more interesting and entertaining as a film. But instead, it doesn't really go anywhere. There's no real action taken or no real conflict resolution. After the point in the film where the teenage daughter is raped, I think the viewer is expecting that to build up into a number of other plot points. One major gripe I have is that the movie teases you into thinking something is going to eventually happen. Is the father going to track down the guy himself and kill the offender or bring him to justice? Well it seems like that's where the film was going, but it never does. I kept waiting for something along those lines to happen..perhaps the FBI catches the guy? Maybe he comes back to try to kill the victim and the family? But no, none of these things ever develop. The film didn't even have enough guts to kill the victim off when she attempted suicide near the end of the film. Any of these events would have made the film a lot more interesting, and you would have at least seen some sort of satisfying ending. Instead, its scene after scene of the family members trying to deal with the event. I understand that those scenes are needed to further connect with the characters, but you need plot development in a film, not just character development. There's a few scenes where you feel that the father (Clive Owen), is going over the edge, but as I said, nothing develops from it. Again, I understand that this is probably depicts a more realistic view on a situation like this, but this is a movie, not a documentary. There is still an element of entertainment and interest that should be reached, no matter how serious the content may be for some viewers. I understand that there's probably a lot of parents out there that attach themselves to this film a bit more, simply because its more easier for them to relate to it, and that's great. But for me, I was expecting a better film than this. I'm not saying the film is bad, in a sense of acting or film-making. And the basic premise of the film is really good. But I just feel it doesn't do much of anything after the main conflict/event in the story occurs.",1340928000,3,2783,4.416342412451362
4436961,5,B004O8OLNQ,"I don't have kids so maybe that's why I'm so surprised at how much the world has changed in the last 20 years since I was a teenager.  This movie -- TRUST -- scared the living daylights out of me because I have a pre-teen niece and I know that she's online and does texting and everything.  I remember when I was in college and chat rooms were just starting to get big and a friend of mine a few years after that got stalked online by a nut she met in a chat somewhere.  In the years since, everything's gotten so much more dangerous.  The Internet can be a really scary place, and kids who've grown up always having the online world are in danger and many of us don't ever realize it.

In addition to this movie being a wakeup call as to what Internet predators are up to these days, it's also something of a mystery/thriller (but don't expect it to be fast-paced like a typical Hollywood movie).  If you like Law & Order:SVU you will like this...only it doesn't tie everything up as neatly as L&O does and it is much more sedate.  This is a movie about an online predator who is smart and has been doing this for a while, what the FBI does to catch these people, and how these predators harm families.

The first hour or so of this is just riveting...and it's the part that parents need to pay attention to because it is terrifying the kind of danger kids can get into online and by using cell phones.

The last twenty minutes get a little slow as the movie runs out of steam a little bit. David Schwimmer from FRIENDS directed this, and maybe a better hand could have done something with this third act.  He clearly wanted the movie to be different, and to not tie things up neatly, but I think it kind of fell apart a little bit.  I was certainly waiting for that GOTCHA! moment where somehow the family finds a clue that sets things into a thriller/action/courtroom drama finale.  It's probably more realistic that things work out the way they do, though.  Real life is not like an episode of SVU.

I actually had to watch the last three minutes or so twice to let it soak in...and reflecting on this, I think the ending is perfect...and downright creepy, too.

Viola Davis is in this and she's wonderful.  The rest of the cast is good, too, even if I wish things had focused a little more on the mom and less on the dad...but the story is primarily about what happens to the relationship between father and daughter once this predator disrupts their idyllic life in a ritzy suburb of Chicago.

Please parents of teens and pre-teens watch this and think about sitting down and showing it to your kids....hopefully SOMEONE out there will see this movie and avoid harm because of the cautionary tale it tells.",1339804800,2,2712,4.370517928286852
4436962,5,B004O8OLNQ,"I watched this movie last night on a whim, simply because I like Clive Owen. It was truly an amazingly well done film about a very difficult subject. Long story short, his 14-year-old daughter falls into the clutches of an internet predator. She thinks he ""loves"" her, she makes excuses, etc. (that may have been the toughest part to watch). Dad loses his mind, pretty much, because he's so upset over the whole thing, and he seems to put his foot wrong in everything. The penultimate scene, where he tells his daughter how sorry he is for not protecting her, literally made my eyes well up (and I don't cry easily). Clive Owen made me really believe in that raw emotion. He should have gotten an Oscar for this movie.

If there's something Clive Owen has retained, it's his likability. But this film is hardly about him as much as it is about his 14 year old daughter who has no idea who's she talking with on the internet. It was very interesting to see how differently everyone around the victim took the rape. Also what happens to the father when he had to tell his business partner about it and his reaction. Another interesting heart rendering sentiment was what the victim feels is love for her which others are calling sexual assault. The insecurities of the teenager and this incident turns her world upside down and it seems she's running on a complete panic mode. Some very good acting performances.

4436974,4,B004O8OLNQ,"I'll start with one of the criticisms of this movie: the way it ends. I'll try not to give away any details about that because it would be a MAJOR spoiler....and even if you think you know how things will turn out, I'm guessing you'll be surprised when the film ends.

That's when you'll decide you wish you hadn't seen the movie - or you'll be glad it was so honest and believable.  It just isn't a ""typical""  or ""pat"" ending. I was glad of that, glad that viewers were trusted to understand why the film ended as it did.

Okay, on to the movie - which focuses on a young woman who is so caught up in texting and calling her friends (as well as strangers she meets online) that her parents have to keep reminding her to pull back, to stop texting at dinner, etc (sound familiar to anyone out there?).

Before long, the teen makes a new friend who isn't who he seems. And that's where I'll stop with the plot line...because it really wouldn't be fair to disclose more. But I will note that (just as with the ending), this isn't seen by the teen or her ""friend"" as a simple case of right and wrong - at least not at first.  It is the adults who see things in a clearer light.

The fine points of the film include a portrayal of complicated family dynamics, a teen yearning for acceptance and romance, and fine performances by all the actors. One of the more unique aspects is how texts are used in place of actual dialogue. This isn't new to film but I find it unique because it is done believably, not always the case when used in other films.

Okay, back to the ending. I found it very, very believable...and also food for thought for those of us who have dealt with the dilemma of kids and internet dangers. Not graphic, not violent but still could be extremely distressing for some. But I was relieved to see that there wasn't that simplistic ending.",1322006400,4,1853,4.304597701149425

I rented (thank God) this movie on the basis of the trailer I saw on another DVD. It was obviously a movie about on-line sexual predator/pedophiles, and per the previews it was going to be emotionally-charged with a climactic payoff.

NOT TO BE!

Whoever was involved in this dreck should have realized there's a reason why a TV show like ""Criminal Minds"" has enjoyed seven years of success: ultimately, the bad guy gets caught -- if not killed outright -- and the audience gets to enjoy an emotional reward for going through the ringer of seeing their crimes, and the effects therefrom.

But that does NOT happen in this movie. After going through a gut-wrenching examination of the effects on one family of being a victim of such a heinous perp, in the end...

I applaud David Schwimmer for pushing people's expectations, but its impossible to expect anyone to like it.  Is this some cautionary tale about the Internet?  Who knows, but it sucked bad.

The movie in less than 30 seconds:  teenager is raped by sicko pervert guy, but still thinks he 'loves her'. Clive Owen is hell-bent on revenge (which would've been a hell of a better movie, but his revenge is unfulfilled) and his attitude causes family problems.  The girl finally is 'un-brainwashed' when she finds out the sicko has done it 3 other times with 3 underage girls.  Dad and girl make up, the end.

Yes, they most likely wanted to portray something more ""realistic"" and focus on how a family can fall apart. Yeah, I get that. But that's something you can watch on a regular talk show or Dateline special.

But I like to watch movies for escapism or to see things that go beyond the ordinary life. I wanted to see the father find the a-hole and kick the crap out of him. If I wanted to see a movie which was only about family members crying and arguing, I could've turned on Dr. Phil.

Don't get me wrong. It's still a well made movie. The acting's good. It just feels like going to a 5 star restaurant with the hopes of dining on a steak dinner only to hear the chefs chit chat in the background and then be told that the kitchen's closed but they hope we enjoyed our visit.",1313625600,5,967,4.361111111111111

Hard to believe that there is anyone alive today who doesn't already know the story. From the time the teenager first goes on the internet, one immediately knows the rest of the movie.

Perhaps this movie should be shown to pre-teeners at an educational or after-school program but, this is not a suspensful or rewarding movie to watch.

4436995,4,B004O8OLNQ,"If you do not do any monitoring of your children's use of their computer gadgetry, this movie makes quite the case for you may be making a huge mistake. Although I adore high tech, I am really glad I did not have my own smartphone when I was a high schooler or college student. The daughter in this film has her own smartphone, computer and other electronic devices.  She is on her smartphone all of the time texting ""Charlie"", a guy she believes is a teenager, like herself.  Her parents do not find this at all strange that she texts him night and day and is building a bubble around herself of living in text messages.

This movie takes the more obvious plot twist by making Charlie not what he seems to be in all of this messaging.  I am sure this happens but it is probably a smaller percentage the number of kids criminally victimized by this practice. I would have preferred if we could have stuck to the more everyday problems of living in a bubble world of text messaging, where the kid starts having trouble dealing with the daily world around herself and especially the fact that she probably doesn't have enough hours in the day.  The pressure of not having enough time to do all the messaging and live your life would really become excruciating in a very short while.

I also would have liked some exposition of why the parents had absolutely no controls over her use of her gadgetry and/or the boys in her life, no matter which way the boys were attempting to enter her life. They really needed to put some restraints on this early teenager. I hope others are doing a better job than they did.

In an age when so much is talked about online predators, it is hard to believe that a teenager would still fall so easily and willingly in the trap on one. The script is just not strong enough and the direction is clumsy (sorry David Schwimmer, I am a big fan). The acting is solid all around, especially from the always reliable Clive Owen.

4436999,5,B004O8OLNQ,"I've read the others' reviews 1st, to avoid redundancy. The message of this movie, which many seem to be missing the point, is that communication, openness & familial support are necessary and watching this movie WITH your children of any age where comprehension is possible, starting a dialogue and remaining open & honest, may help one avoid or prevent this event from happening in your family, or if it doesn't, may help you deal with the fallout. Adults reviewing say it is difficult watching, especially with their child/ren, I say be emotionally honest WHILE watching, say ""this hurts me to watch & imagine you in that situation"", ask ""do you know anyone this has happened to"", ask ""has anyone approached you this way & what did you do"". Be open & non-judgmental in accepting their honest answers, be willing & able to openly discuss these issues so that your child knows they can rely on you, TRUST YOU, knows they can bring you their questions & experiences in safety & love. In the special features, this is the hope of the makers of this movie, that an open dialogue can be started & to help others recognize the signs to watch out for.

I especially appreciated the family's experience, the father's inability to deal with his daughter's sexuality &/or sexual identity, the reality of his emotions & fears, his rage & helplessness. The mother's frustration and different coping style, the difference in approach to coping between the parents and other family members. Everything about this movie is REAL, credible, believable, factual, every piece of dialogue is natural, the acting & directing as well as production quality could not be any better than in this movie. Entertaining as well as educational, emotional and physical reactions are expected and hoped for, a response is guaranteed in every viewer regardless of age, experience, opinion, belief, or family dynamics. This film has less violence, gore, thrills or chills than most cable TV or soap opera episodes, the most difficult scenes are the father's imaginings of what his daughter went through or of his murderous rage fantasies of killing the predator (or any sex offender he can find), as well as the initial scene in the motel room which is G-rated except for the torment Annie displays. Especially appreciated is the inclusion and depiction of how a victim reacts at the time of the incident, showing Annie disassociating from the activity, staring at something else to take herself out of the terrified body & mind being tormented, as a self-defense mechanism nearly all victims experience in order to survive.

Annie's confusion, defiance & even defense of the man, is accurate & honest, something many viewers will find shocking and incredible, until you understand the level of maturity and doubt any teen faces while honing their personality, character, identity. There are many films a hundred times worse to watch than this one, which has a PG rating, covering similar perspectives. What makes this movie different is the emotional context, the underlying truths that are not in your face as some films that use shock value might portray. An objective story is told with no assumptions, nothing forced or stiff in delivering the realities every family faces these days, in different ways than past generations. What should result from viewing this movie is genuine family intimacy in opening the subject for honest conversations. Riveting in style & content, the issues addressed here are happening every second of every day--it's about time we started paying attention & changing what we can.

Technically, the digital copy of the movie is approx. 829 MB, on same disc as movie, placed into DVD drive on a computer, in MPG-4 format. The digital copy is not HD, in fact it is not even HQ, and plays only in wide screen, if full screen is forced, the picture goes off screen (even on a wide screen HD monitor).

4437001,4,B004O8OLNQ,"This is a tough movie to rate. On the one hand it's done very well. On the other hand most anyone, not living in a cave, is aware of the subject matter to the point this might not offer much new.

Here's the scoop. A young girl is prayed upon by an on-line predator. She agrees to meet him only to find out he's much older than he said. Bad stuff happens and everybody tries to cope and get their lives back on track.

On the good side. This is a well written, well acted and well directed piece. The script takes a nice turn in its approach with the daughter (Annie). Her response to what happened is not what the viewer might expect. This really helps things along, because it makes it so the story isn't just a hunt for the perp. It's about how the family tries to work through everything. They do insert the FBI investigation at regular intervals so the viewer gets a decent taste of how the authorities deal with all this. The problem is that the story concerns a very hot topic. It's something that is often in the news as well as on news based programs. Most viewers will probably be aware of many of the facets of this so there might be little new here for them.

And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue

(Jennifer Lopez)

Short attention span summary:

1. Internet love is blind
2. Impressionable teenager finds love with sweet talking stranger of variable age.
3. The inevitable occurs
4. Father doesn't always know best
5. All's not well, and doesn't end well.

Fourteen year old Annie ignores her little inner voice of reason, and even though she is uncomfortable that her on-line ""boyfriend"" is much older than he first admitted, she falls for his flattery and ego-boosting compliments with horrifying consequences.  When it is later revealed that she has been well and truly deceived into thinking that ""Charlie"" loves her, her rude awakening shatters her fragile self-esteem.

Her father naturally wants to go out and kill somebody in retaliation, and some of his actions, though understandable, are rather extreme, which put a further strain on the family.  Annie bears the burden of the pressure from family and her peers, and as can be expected, peers can be very cruel to each other.

This well-acted movie opens the doors for family discussion on the subject of internet chat rooms and the dangers of on-line hook-ups.  It also shows that there are predators lurking around every corner, and emphasizes the need to educate your children about disclosing information to strangers and believing that everything they hear is the truth.

My only quibble is the abrupt ending, which patches up one troubled relationship, but leaves all others hanging.  The clip during the credits reveals that life goes on regardless.

""Some lovers just rely on their hearts
The core remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will, it's just a question of when""

4437007,5,B004O8OLNQ,"I watched this film with my teen-age children, and I must say this is a very real movie, sadly very real.  It caught my attention the fact that no one is free from this, because they are a functional family, predators are looking to lure everyone, and like Mr. Patrick Atkinson says ""the recipee for trouble is: naive teens, predatory adults, and a medium that connects them"".  This is so true, but the film is powerfully emotional, the writing is flawless, the direction and execution is breathtaking.  The performances are absolutely remarkable and vivid.

One thing that was very shocking and real for me was the exquisiteness and accuracy of the details in the movie.  If you have experienced a situation similar or have been in contact with persons who have suffered this kind of abuse, you know that they remember vividly every detail of the abuser, and it was very clear in the movie, sometimes it is kind of raw, but sadly this is the reality.

This film is a must see for every parent, I would send a copy of this to every school and church, it's not about raising panic, but awareness, as parents we have to know who the teachers of our children are, because you never know.  This film is an excellent tool to teach our children how to protect themselves, because we are not going to be with them 24/7.",1312070400,,1312,4.533898305084746
4437008,5,B004O8OLNQ,"TRUST is a powerhouse of a film based on a personal story of a family's coping with a mad world.  Every character in this film exemplifies a form a trust - won or broken, earned or abused - and that is another reason that aside from the social commentary  of the abuses of our Internet dominated lives that everyone should see this movie. The searing script was written by Robert Festinger (of 'In the Bedroom' fame) and Andy Bellin and is the feature film directing debut of actor David Schwimmer: if this film is any indication of the understated power of Schwimmer's directorial eye then he should have a long career ahead.

TRUST focuses on a suburban family, rich in tradition and very closely knit, who seem to be the prototypical happy American family.  The film opens with a birthday dinner for Annie (Liana Liberato) who is successful in sports and school but feels a need to belong to the 'in group' of peers, a strange kink in an otherwise emotionally mature teenager. She is obviously loved and supported by her successful father Will (Clive Owen) who gifts her with a laptop computer, her mother Lynn (Catherine Keener) who adapts well to the daily changes of growing up youngsters, her older brother (about to leave for college) Peter (Spencer Cornutt) and her little sister Katie (Aislinn DeButch). All progresses well until Annie meets a boyfriend Charlie (Chris Henry Coffey) on line.  After a few months of chatting, texting, phoning, and sharing photographs, Annie is in love - and then Charlie begins to lie about his age and his initial images as a high school jock (Tristan Peach) change to a college student, then a grad student - lies that Annie continues to accept and cope with until Charlie promises to fly to see her: in a mall meeting Charlie is actually 35 years old, brings Annie a gift of undergarments, and convinces Annie to go to a hotel room where Charlie claims 'love knows no age boundaries' and the relationship is consummated.

The remainder of the film deals with how Annie's family deals with the discovery of Annie's physical interaction with Charlie.  The police are brought in and an investigation is headed by Detective Doug Tate (Jason Clark) while individual therapy is provided by the gifted Gail Friedman (Viola Davis).  The events lead to Annie's being informed that Charlie is a predator and a pedophile, the reaction of Will to the lack of speed in the investigation, and the stable force of Lynn.  How the brutal outside incision made on this family heals is the major emotional impact of the film.

Each of the actors involved offer exceptionally finessed performances: we would expect that from Clive Owen, Catherine Keener, Viola  Davis, and Jason Clark, but the role of Annie is very strongly portrayed by newcomer Liana Liberato.  This films powerful message is one that should be required viewing by students and families around the world. It strongly suggests the dangers of Internet dating and the possible connection to pedophiles.  Grady Harp, July 11",1312070400,5,3015,4.853801169590644

Make no mistake-this is not a movie for kids to watch themselves or even with a parent as the content is too powerful. But for parents who are still not believers that something bad can happen to their kids on the internet, you need to go see this movie.  Clive Owen is the father of Annie who meets someone online who she thinks is her age but turns out to be 35.  He proceeds to come to Chicago to meet her and then rapes her in a motel room.

Or, films (and ratings dependent news organizations) profiting by sensationalizing a topic to shock a narrowly focused, boxed in middle class audience that so happens to benefit from all those other listed exploitations but are best served to ignore them even though that list affects an unimaginably larger number of people?
