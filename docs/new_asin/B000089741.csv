7979989,5,B000089741,"I have to agree with the reviewers Elaine and jeijeiroja: I thought this was a great video for kids and adults about family life in Egypt.

In this particular video from ""Families of the World,"" the two kids are both Muslim. Yasmine's family has more money, and because her mother and father work in more upscale jobs near Cairo, their life may seem more like the lives of those of the folks I watched this video with: modern, cosmopolitan even.

But Hesham's family lives in Luxor, near the Valley of the Kings, and their life in such an amazing place is necessarily going to seem exotic and fascinating to foreigners like us. Hesham's dad is even working on a team to help restore one of the tombs at this historic site. My students thought this was way cool!

The materials that came with this video for teachers are, as usual, excellent. I'd highly recommend this ""Families of the World"" entry to schools and libraries, and I've been told it's been broadcast by our local PBS station.",1290211200,,988,4.6022727272727275
7979990,5,B000089741,"Though I take exception to Ms. Mawson's comments about the narration of this video about the lives of Egyptian children, I'd suggest looking at video clips on YouTube to decide for yourself. Check out *Families of Egypt (Families of the World) Rural Trailer* and *Urban Trailer* to learn a bit about Hesham and Yasmine's lives. I think you'll find, as my students and the kids in our family did, that the narration works just fine for this excellent video.",1290038400,,456,4.784810126582278
7979991,4,B000089741,"I have this video and the one on China and they are both very informative.  Students like to hear what life is like from other students and this was great.  WARNING:  There is a mother breastfeeding in the video.  Otherwise it focuses on the lives of a boy who lives in the country side and a young girl (wealthier) who lives in the suburbs of Cairo, plays tennis, and is learning three languages.",1245369600,,397,4.397260273972603

This is an educational DVD obviously for American school children which presents the contrasting lives of the rural and urban dwelling Egyptian families. However, I was extremely annoyed to hear the strong American accents in the voice overs of the Egyptian children featured in the DVD. Whilst the narrative was informative and the lives of both families authentic, the children's accents were irritating and spoilt the impact of the DVD for me.",1220832000,,644,6.853658536585366
