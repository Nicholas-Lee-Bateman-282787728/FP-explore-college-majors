1785032,2,B00006LPE1,"My family enjoys the Kidsongs DVDs, but this title my least favorite. It is inaccurate and not as fun as the others. If you want to buy a Kidsongs DVD, purchase Very Silly Songs or Old McDonald's Farm.",1358467200,,201,4.315789473684211
1785033,3,B00006LPE1,The songs on this DVD just don't hold my granddaughter's attention/interest like the songs on the Silly Songs DVD do.,1358035200,,117,4.9
1785034,4,B00006LPE1,"My mom had this video for her daycare kids and I saw it and wanted it for my kids.  Yes, it's a little old, not the new fancy graphics but what I love is the classic old songs it is teaching my kids.  That and the history of America.  I had not seen the video in probable 20 years yet I still knew all the songs.  Love that my kids can learn and enjoy the video at the same time.",1353024000,,379,3.7
1785035,5,B00006LPE1,"WE love this dvd.  It has many good patriotic songs plus some fun ones!  It is one of our favorites.
The last song which is a celebration is okay but the only one that isn't quite like the rest.
A great dvd with parades, uncle sam, songs, & square dancing.",1351555200,,256,4.1
1785036,3,B00006LPE1,"The children watched it one or two times and it has not been in the machine again.  No near as good as the one on the farm, old mcDonalds, etc...",1252713600,,145,3.8333333333333335
1785037,5,B00006LPE1,This Kidsong DVD is excellent!  I am a music teacher and use this DVD in my teaching about America's great patriotic songs.,1240704000,,123,4.590909090909091
1785038,4,B00006LPE1,"It is always surprising to see that it is possible to create an interesting DVD with the patriotic songs. You mix together Uncle Sam, some children, some singers, some dancers and some landscape and you create a magical journey through America's proud history. For an American of a foreigner, it is always interesting to see the way that Americans see their country. Interesting mainly for children or for foreigner.",1120003200,2,416,5.043478260869565
7971560,5,B00006LPE1,I have the VHS versions that my daughter watched over and over when she was a kid.  I decided to get the DVD versions.  They are just as great as I remember.,1492560000,,157,3.875
7971561,5,B00006LPE1,Great addition to my daughter's collection,1491350400,,42,6.166666666666667
7971562,5,B00006LPE1,"Wonderful music video for children.  Even we the grandparents enjoy watching this one.  Very spirited, educational and upbeat, even for younger children who may not grasp the historical aspect presented.  My three year old grandsons and even the two year old stop and watch mesmerized.
Buy it and enjoy with the little ones.",1446163200,,324,5.0754716981132075
7971563,5,B00006LPE1,Great DVD.,1437782400,,10,4.5

7971565,5,B00006LPE1,"I like this product and so did my grandchildren but they tired of it after a few days because (to quote the 4 year old) there was not enough songs on disc....I think they didn't like the snippets of history because they were too young to understand, probably a great gift for 6 year olds.",1408579200,,288,4.254545454545455
7971566,5,B00006LPE1,"I actually already had this, but didn't know it!  I brought a copy previously, used, and it came without a case, so I didn't see the picture on the front - I also thought it had another title.  I bought this specifically to go with my USA (Memorial Day, Labor Day, Veteran's Day themes) at school.  A little ""bummed"" when I realized - 1) I already owned it 2) not many patriotic parts in it - although there's some ""easy"" history on the US.  I was actually hoping for more ""red, white and blue"".  My fault for not checking it out more carefully.  My kids at school love music and these are great resources for me on rainy days when we can't go out to recess!  My own children loved these when they first came out in VHS format!  They have been around for awhile, but these original (13?) are the best ones!",1401321600,,806,4.222222222222222
7971567,5,B00006LPE1,It's a very nice tribute to the USA and teaches little ones what our great country is all about !  Great gift !,1384473600,,111,3.8260869565217392
7971568,3,B00006LPE1,I wish there had been more patriotic songs included but love what is on the DVD and lookforward to more in the ffuture.,1383091200,,119,4.217391304347826
7971569,5,B00006LPE1,My special needs son LOVES the Kidsongs series. I needed to purchase this to replace a worn out copy. I suspect that I will be buying more copies as time goes by. I have been listening to Kidsongs for the past 18 years. My son's tastes have not changed. So happy they are still available.,1360195200,3,288,4.254545454545455
