4232904,5,B003Z8ZCE8,"A good creepy J-horror. Follows a curse (similar to a curse anyway) kind of theme. Spread by phone, internet, and word of mouth. This creepy almost Ouija board like, with hints of voodoo, game is causing many people to disappear. Like it so much that half way through I paused it to order the sequel. Standard J-Horror. So if that is your thing makes for a good purchase.",1417478400,,371,4.470588235294118
8409998,4,B003Z8ZCE8,"Aka ""Hitori kakurenbo"" HIDE AND GO KILL is another Japanese horror movie that owes a lot of its inspiration to the classic Japanese ghost story JU-ON: THE GRUDGE. The story is about a group of high school girls who spend their private lives going online and visiting a weird blog which may or may not be haunted. Soon enough the girls find themselves spooked by a sinister figure when they decide to play a game of hide and seek...

 A creep-fest such as this has plenty of potential, and the director utilizes it well! Check it out",1523836800,,532,4.474226804123711
8409999,2,B003Z8ZCE8,"Sorry...  this is certainly in the realm of poor J-horror...  there are a TON out there that are way better...  nothing much scary in this one, and it seemed like more than 1/2 the movie was watching people either text on their phones or blog on their computer...

Beyond that...  you don't need to tell me 18 times during the course of the movie how to play ""hide and seek alone""...  one time really would have been sufficient...  and then maybe they could have used the additional 20+ mins worth of movie time to work on more character development or something...

Overall...  I watched it cause I really do like most J-Horror flicks, but this one just totally misses the mark...",1500768000,,681,4.56198347107438

8410001,4,B003Z8ZCE8,"This is a pretty good horror film with an original concept. And that concept makes it pretty scary. That's a lot coming from me, as I'm a horror fan, but I find that most horror films aren't that great. This is definitely an exception.

By the way, the game in this movie was invented as guerrilla promotion for the film. I've seen a lot of people saying stupid things like, ""Oh, they made a movie about the game?""... No, the movie invented the game and floated it out to popular message boards on the internet to make people researching it think it's real. It's called guerrilla marketing. Just like they did for Blair Witch, long before it was released.

Warning - Make sure you don't waste your money on part 2 if you like this one. I learned that lesson the hard way. It goes under 2 names - ""Hide and Go Kill 2"" and ""Creepy Hide and Seek."" I like the first one so much that I immediately purchased the second. However, I found very quickly that this not only has zero to do with the first movie, but none of the original writers, directors, actors, characters, etc. have anything to do with this movie. And that's on top of the movie simply LOOKING LIKE GARBAGE. It's like a bunch of 10 year old kids found a vhs camcorder from 1996 and filmed it in their house while their parents were out. Absolute garbage. Just stick with the original.",1461110400,,1344,4.372

8410003,3,B003Z8ZCE8,"The movie was very amateurish. Love the concept, but honestly the concept is the only scary part of this movie. It is very slow moving, the camera work is quite poor, the music is terrible, acting is very subpar, and the climax is pretty disappointing. I still enjoyed it because the game within this movie interests me, but other than that blegh.",1425513600,,347,4.612903225806452

8410005,3,B003Z8ZCE8,"The movie itself is divided into three ""chapters"" entitled ""first body"", ""second body"", etc which is a bit stupid considering (mild spoiler alert) there isn't simply ONE death every chapter. Anyhow, the story revolves an internet novella known as ""Lonely Girl"" that itself revolves around a ritualistic game called ""Hide and Seek Alone"" in which one undergoes a series of steps (I won't go into detail here) to cut up, bind up and possess a stuffed animal with the devil and hide out in a closet themselves. In all three of the storylines, the characters end up missing an important step stupidly enough and it doesn't end pretty.

Like the title of my review says, the story itself is tedious. The first sequence consist of text being typed out on a page, obviously some sort of forum where strangers discuss the implications of the ""hide and seek alone"" game. If it weren't for the scene that played out 6 minutes into the film in the background, I would've probably stopped watching but at least it piqued my interest a bit. As for confusing, I'm not even sure what happens, or why the characters make such stupid choices. You have a deranged girl from chapter 1 who harasses and stalks her best friend after a long time of absense from school, forcing her to play the game. Then in the second one, you have three friend who try to ""experiment"" with the game by filming it in which case the whole ""hide and seek alone"" thing  kind of falls short of a game that is played out of loneliness which the overarching story tries to establish.

Contradictions like that keep arising. Especially when the forum users keep bringing up that people have been disappearing after playing the game. Nope. There's just a bunch of dead bodies everywhere.

Scare level? Not even. I mean, the whole ritual processing of cutting up a doll is a bit chilling, but the anticipation is about as scary as paranormal activity... you know, waiting 10 minutes at one camera angle to see a whole swing open. In my opinion... not very scary. Tedious. I ended up skipping through the last chapter.

After the credits, there's a bit more text from the forum users that float around. Not sure I would've stayed around long enough if I hadn't liked the ending song.",1424563200,5,2235,4.648101265822785
8410006,4,B003Z8ZCE8,"Hide and Go Kill, or better stated, Hide and Go Seek Alone,  was an interesting film about fooling around with things that are better off left untouched.

The basic idea can be compared to an Ouija Board scenario. Only in this case, it's a game where the player goes through a ritual of summoning a ghost. Then they try to hide from it, in order to win the game. The players learn about the game through the internet, where they anonymously chat with one another about the rules. Once they get down the rules, they can attempt to beat the ghost, if they remember to follow all the rules correctly. And the list of rules is quite creepy to say the least.

As you can tell, the thrill factor is what entices young people to want to play the game. Some claim they get a rush out of facing their fear. But at the same time, its addicting for them. In any case, the film goes through several episodes of characters playing the game, with mixed results. There's plenty of creepy moments, along with some side drama, to keep things interesting.

I  have to say, I did like the film overall. It was definitely a fresh idea, and the Japanese really seem to know how to make a ghost film creepy, without all the flashy gore used in Hollywood.

That being said, the formula reminds me of other Japanese films, where the characters come at us in a chain. The reason for that is the way the movie focuses on one group of characters, while new ones are brought in to play the game.  I've seen that style of storytelling used before, and it seems to be a favorite of Japanese film makers. What it means for the viewer though, is some of the characters will carry the movie for about a quarter of the film, then the new group will be focused on. Then a third person may be the focus. So we're not always following one character from beginning to end. And in a film like this, that really has to be the scenario.  It just means background characters end up at the forefront later on. No big deal.

One of the highlights used here, besides the characters interacting in person, is the fact that we only see them chatting back and forth on a computer screen at times. That may sound rather boring at first, but when someone is typing things like, I hear something, or I just stabbed my doll and it's a huge mess, or help, I forgot my glass of water, the conversation can be quite creepy. There's times where that's going on with only the horror soundtrack playing in the background, and it was quite effective.

Anyway, the film is offered in Japanese only with English subtitles. The only other features included are a photo gallery of scenes from the film, and a catalogue of other films offered by Cinema Epoch.

In the end, I'm giving the film a four. The game was  creepy and was a good take on the Ouija Board theme. The actors did a decent job with their roles, and the back and forth ""panic"" chat was a nice twist. A decent viewing at night, with all the lights out.

But I don't think I'll playing the game myself. I don't need a ghost creeping around my house, looking for me.  =)",1419206400,,3071,4.336823734729494
