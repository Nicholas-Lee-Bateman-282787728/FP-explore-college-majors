The vendor offered to refund my money, but I would have had to pay more to ship it back to them.

So it will occupy drawer space until the first opportunity I can give it to someone as a white elephant gift.",1370390400,2,308,3.857142857142857
8624206,1,B000VI5BVO,"I have bought a ton of items on Amazon over the years but this was my first review, so that should tell you something.  This video was maybe 20 mins long, total.  Ordinarily that would have disappointed me since that would mean there was so little content for the money, but in this case I'm not sure I could have stood any more!  There was not even one single useful crumb of enlightening information on this thing.  What little content there was was mere common sense.  The video was low quality and totally lacking of substance.  Do not waste money on this DVD - do your home theater research on the web!",1367280000,,607,4.375
