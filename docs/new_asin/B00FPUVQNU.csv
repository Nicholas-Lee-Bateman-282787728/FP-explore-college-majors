8617800,4,B00FPUVQNU,"One of the latest among a number of recent films that tackle the culture of practicing Orthodox Jews in Israel, this represents a strong effort that is well worth acquiring.  The film, whose title in Hebrew means ""Overseers"" or ""Supervisors,"" follows a (relatively) newly observant young Jewish Israeli named Avi and his two friends as they transition from developing their own observance of halacha (Jewish law) to enforcing halacha among the residents of their neighborhood regardless of their feelings.  The plot gets complicated as Avi falls for an attractive but secular young woman, Miri, and tries to bring her around to full observance.  There is also a somewhat underdeveloped sub-plot about tensions and violence between the Arab and Jewish residents of the neighborhood.

The story is set in Bat Yam, an ethnically/religiously mixed neighborhood south of Tel Aviv, and is a great window into the culture and life of a working-class Israeli town.  The characters speak in clear but slangy Hebrew, and this is a great film to view repeatedly if you are working on the language and are at an intermediate level of mastery.  Avi comes from a family of Turkish Sephardic Jews, and, as an added treat, attentive listeners will hear a few lines of Judeo-Spanish (""Ladino"") delivered by Avi's father while he's serving a customer in his fruit stand (Bat Yam is a population-center for Ladino speakers in Israel).  Also, the film provides interesting glimpses into the religious culture of Israel through Avi's interaction with his kiruv (outreach) rabbi and with a Breslover Hasid for whom he makes remixes of religious music.  This is definitely a film made with a primarily Israeli audience in mind; so, while little-to-no knowledge of Israeli culture and/or Jewish observance should not keep you from watching this film, you'll get more out of it if you bring some awareness of these to the table.

For all of its glimpses into ordinary life, the film really is about Avi, though, and, ultimately, all of the plot points and characters, including the female lead, Miri, are there to serve a narrative about Avi's development as an Orthodox Jew and his relationship to Jewish law.  On the positive side, the subjugation of all things to Avi gives the film a tightness and focus that keep the film engaging and easy to follow.  Unfortunately, viewers will also, I think, be left with some dissatisfaction over not seeing characters and issues raised by the film as fully developed as the might have been.  Still, the film is compelling and worth watching more than once.",1406678400,2,2574,5.0023419203747075
