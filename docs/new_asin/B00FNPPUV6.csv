8617246,5,B00FNPPUV6,"I watched this when MHZ was still televised in my area - and then again when it was repeated - and I thought the quality of the story and every aspect of the production were extraordinary. The atmosphere of the film and many specific scenes have stayed with me since, so now I've bought it to watch again with friends. I may write a more detailed review after I've seen it again, but in the meantime, I can't recommend it enough.

If you enjoy high quality 'foreign' films - and particularly if you're old enough to remember or to have heard first-person accounts of what for some of us is still 'the war' - you'll love this film. I very much regret that there seems to've been no publicity for the film - and particularly since the book was highly acclaimed - and to see here, too, that it isn't better known. So, word of mouth it is.",1425427200,4,835,4.284810126582278

8617248,5,B00FNPPUV6,This is a wonderful story over three generations and all ties together so well. I really wish there were more stories with this depth. There are very few stories from World War ll that have a story line with such strong woman characters from one family. I would highly recommend this to everyone.,1398211200,4,296,4.60377358490566
8617249,5,B00FNPPUV6,"This wasn't exactly a mystery as I'd expected, although throughout the story there is a puzzle.  A young man's mother is raped as the rest of the world celebrates the end of WWII.  The family is loving and close and only the woman's mother and sister are aware of the fact that the new child is the result of this rape.

The two boys compete and grow together but when the gandmother tells the 'half brother' how he came to be, his already dificult personality becomes even more so..  Competition over a woman and other issues drive them apart.  The story starts with one brother trying to get a screenplay sold.  The other brother has disappeared.  It moves back and forth from there to the start of the story - the rape.  Fascinating characters and the actions caused by their circumstances are well told.  Well worth buying if you like family sagas.",1386028800,4,852,4.552631578947368
