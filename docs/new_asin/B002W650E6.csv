4005978,5,B002W650E6,Returned home from Sicily recently. Watching DVD was almost like being their. It represents the beauty and glory of this magical island.,1371254400,,136,5.2272727272727275
4005979,5,B002W650E6,"Wonderful DVD weather you have been or are going
Ruin do NOT walk and buy this....
Enjoyable entertaining Unless you go to Italy twice a year you need to have a DVD library of Italy to make the distance tolerable.",1367107200,,213,4.35
4005980,4,B002W650E6,"Although I have visited Italy, I have not visited Sicily but this DVD is an excellent example.

4005981,4,B002W650E6,"I am planning a trip to Sicilia and bought this video to get an idea of what to expect. The video is nice; you will not lose your money buying it. Unfortunately, the narrator's voice is at times difficult to understand. Also, I think that it would be best if along with a city's name, they show its location in the map. I watched the video with a map of Sicilia at hand but sometimes I was unable to find the places she has speaking about.
This video shows very important sites in the island. In this sense it is very good. However, it is like a catalog, like, 1,2,3,4 and so on. There is no separation of sites by groups (e.g., archeological sites or beaches) or any type of clear order. The narrator's voice is monotonous too. So, if you are planning a trip without a tour like me, you're left without recommendations that could help you organize it.
Other than these shortcomings, it is still a good video to watch, image quality is excellent.",1291766400,4,946,4.380681818181818
4005982,5,B002W650E6,"Professionally filmed and narrated, this 60-minute video provides an excellent overview of Sicily. Combined with a good guidebook, it will be especially useful for travelers planning a trip to the (very large) island.

Among the areas visited are:

  * Palermo;
  * Mondello;
  * Monreale;
  * Citta del Mare;
  * Segesta;
  * Erice;
  * Selinunto;
  * Cefalu;
  * Ragusa;
  * Siracusa;
  * Catania;
  * Mount Etna;
  * Taormina; and
  * Messina

The video is information-dense; it provides a lot of bang for the buck. It focuses on the most attractive sights on the island, and should prove useful for a visitor trying to decide which city to use as his/her base and/or sights to visit.

My only criticism of it is that orders for it are fulfilled by CreateSpace a division of Amazon, which burns disks on an as-needed basis. Unfortunately, the disk sent to me contained significant blanks and lapses. This is Amazon's on-going problem [I have encountered it before], not that of the producers of the disk [Shepherd Entertainment Cities of the World]

8382877,3,B002W650E6,nice but in the boring side,1471824000,,27,3.6666666666666665
8382878,3,B002W650E6,"Shows places all over the island, although in no apparent order. Good scenery and overviews, but overall quality is just okay. Narrator's pronunciations of some people and place names are way off the mark. Stressing the wrong syllable in Trpani is one thing, but ""Dionysus"" sounding similar to ""hypothesis"" is just silly.",1452902400,,321,5.1923076923076925

8382880,5,B002W650E6,This was  sort of a recap for me of a recent trip to Sicily but it made me wish I had seen the video before I took the trip.  This is an especially well done video that features some of the major cities in Sicily. It also features some of the major sites of interest to tourists and those who have an interest in the antiquities. This is a must-see video for anyone planning a visit to Sicily.,1425340800,,393,4.0256410256410255
8382881,1,B002W650E6,Shaky handheld camera footage makes this amateur video difficult to watch,1424476800,2,73,5.7272727272727275

8382884,2,B002W650E6,"A little boring, hard to make it to the end. It is okay if you have never seen or heard anything about the cities in Italy, but for someone who has been there, it didn't add any new knowledge.",1395446400,,192,3.948717948717949
8382885,4,B002W650E6,Nice systematic introduction to the main sites in Sicily.  Good starting place for planning a trip. That's all there is folks.,1390262400,,126,5.0
