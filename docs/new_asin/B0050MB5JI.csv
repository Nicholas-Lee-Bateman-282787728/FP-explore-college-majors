4515374,5,B0050MB5JI,"This is the Malaysian imported version. They named the DVD cover with the series name ""gantz the first stage the perfect answer"".

What you are getting is ""the first stage"" or really in the US it is just called ""Gantz"". It's movie number 1 of a 2 part series. The second stage is not out yet and from previews the US title will probably be ""Gantz Perfect Answer""

Anyway, its a good movie, but don't expect both in this package as the second one isn't even out.

Also, I guess these sets are more expensive to import and they do have nice slip covers; but there are other cheaper import versions (without slip covers and without subtitles) that you can find. Just search Amazon for ""Gantz live action"". The Hong Kong imports are English dubbed and cost less than $20.

The US versions (non imported) aren't out yet (at the time I write this)",1310169600,2,841,4.441558441558442
4515375,5,B0050MB5JI,"As with many Asian imports the DVD menu is not that great. You have to select Gantz than move the mouse over to another option on the left for play movie. Not sure why playing the movie is two menu's deep.

Anyway, this is a minor annoyance, the movie itself is fantastic. Great storyline, great costumes. Even the dub voices aren't bad.

If you are a fan of Gantz manga or anime you will want this, and even if you haven't seen those and are just a fan of oddball sci fi movies, this is enjoyable.

Watch till the end of the credits and you will see the trailer for the sequel (which isn't out yet as I write this)

This disc also has a bonus anime series on it, I only glanced at it, and you have to turn on subtitles for English, it looks interested but haven't had time to watch it all the way through. It's a typical big robot brawler from the looks of it. (don't worry, Gantz the movie has English dub, it's only the bonus anime that needs subtitles and from the looks of the action there isn't much talking in it anyway, I skimmed it and it was alot of fights)",1310169600,,1067,4.115384615384615
4515396,5,B0050MB5JI,"Gantz on Blu-ray? YES, I'm in. I was floored by the first film in the series. I am a fanboy of the manga and had high expectations. A lot of fans complain about the cast being whiney and melodramatic, however, I don't find myself scathed like the rest. When you have a film adaption, there are elements bound to shift from the source material. Written words will translate different when acted out and printed on celluloid. I was quite pleased overall with the result.

The Blu-ray is awesome, as expected. The features include the Director's Interview with Shinsuke Sato, Cast Profiles with Kazunari Ninomiya and Kenichi Matsuyama, and a bonus DVD. I highly recommend 'nabbing' Perfect Answer if you buy Gantz!",1459468800,,711,4.87603305785124

I do have to say I really did enjoy this great movie but it did fall short in some cases.  Mainly being in the second mission where it was more for laughs if anything.  There was only one alien and they didn't even show the birds inside sadly.  However the last round was really well done and the first wasn't half bad either.  Overall its great for gantz fans alike.

4515429,5,B0050MB5JI,"I must admit that for the longest time I avoided the whole Gantz thing, but then I got curious about what was so good about a series that was reportedly excessively violent that it spawned not one, but two live action movies. I got the anime series and watched it last week and today I watched the blu-ray version of the the first movie. This is a review of the first movie.

The thrust of the anime series was mainly on the characterization of all the people drawn into Gantz battles. As such there was a LOT of back story, but was a good run-down on how life or death situations would affect non-military type people. This movie cuts out a lot of that and so the focus shifts to the Gantz situation and the battles themselves. It also cuts out the soft-core hentai sex scenes. Since the film is only two hours long, the battles are really truncated. This shortening results in a tighter emphasis on the battles, for those who are action, and not talk oriented. This movie covers the first three of the four trips through Gantz battles in the anime.

I watched the show with subtitles, which I prefer. The blu-ray disk didn't give me any problems, and the detail was terrific. This also meant that all the blood-spattering was in a lot more detail, so be forewarned. This isn't any Robo-geisha with bleeding buildings, but very realistic and easily comparable to any Hollywood production.

In the Gantz I movie, it still tries to follow how Kei's feelings about killing things changes over time, from abhorring it, to thinking he is a hero, to trying to protect his friends.  If you want to see a lot more in-depth of things like this for All the characters watch the anime. In fact, watch the anime director's comments on the anime disk before you watch the show, since it will help you catch the detail in the Gantz storyline.",1336953600,,1829,4.516616314199395
4515430,4,B0050MB5JI,"In 2000, mangaka Hiroya Oku created the ""Gantz"" manga series.  A series which is still ongoing to this day.

The 26-episode, two season anime series was released in 2004 and for many Americans, it was among the popular series to be released on DVD due to its sci-fi action, adult humor and violence.

Five years later, it was announced that two live action ""Gantz"" films were being created and starring in the film is actor and idol singer and ARASHI member Kazunari Nonomiya (""Letters from Iwo Jima"", ""Yamada Taro Monogatari"", ""Ryusei no Kizuna""), actor Kenichi Matsuyama (""Death Note"" films, ""L: Change the World"", ""Kamui Gaiden"") and the film would be directed by Shinsuke Sato (""The Princess Blade"", ""Tokyo Lullabye"", ""Sunadokei"" and also character and scene developer for the video game ""Tekken 4').

The film was shown in America first as it was simulcast in theaters in 46 states, in Japan, the first film was released in theaters on January 29th.  With the second film being screened in July  at San Diego Comic-Con, the film makes its debut on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of New People Entertainment.

It's important to note that the films are loosely-based on the manga and anime series.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

It's important to note that if one wants the best picture and audio quality of ""Gantz"", a Blu-ray version of the film is available.  As for the DVD, the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen and presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital Japanese and English.

As for picture quality, as expected for a DVD, you do see some artifacts but for the most part, the good news is that New People Entertainment decided to put the special features on a second disc in order to give the film better PQ.  Again, the Blu-ray version is the one to go with for better picture quality but the DVD is good.  It's important to note that while the film is bloody, to not make it so violent, the blood is darkened to black.

As for the audio, the film has quite a bit of action, so I did notice a good use of the surround channels.  From explosions to metal upon metal clanging (especially Kato vs. the 100-arm Bhudda), the action sequences do sound great on DVD.  But of course, nothing beats lossless and if you have a Blu-ray player, Blu-ray and HD is the way to go!

As for the dialogue, I prefer to watch films in their original language and don't listen to the English dub.  But for those who refuse to watch a film with English subtitles, you do have the choice to watch it with an English dub.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Gantz"" comes with the following special features on Disc-2:

  Gantz Japanese Original Trailers - Featuring several GANTZ TV commercial and movie trailers.
  Director's Profile & Interview - (28:51) Interviews with filmmaker Shinsuke Sato talking about the first film and how it leads to the second film.  As well as the challenges of shooting the film and casting decisions.
  New People Presents - A trailer for previously released New People entertainment films.

JUDGMENT CALL:

What one can expect from a popcorn action film starring a few of Japanese top young talents!  ""GANTZ"" features constant action that will thrill you!  Possibly one of the better film adaptations from a manga series in terms of visual effects and costume design.

I personally enjoyed ""GANTZ"" for the reason that I'm familiar with the talent on the film.  Kazunari Ninomiya of ARASHI fame is very popular as with actor Kenichi Matsuyama, but even before I watched this film, I always felt that the costumes of ""GANTZ"" was the coolest costumes since the Matrix!

But with that being said, this is a popcorn action film with a lot of action and visual effects but at the same time, it's a film that is quite different from the manga/anime series.  Granted, there was quite a bit of perversion with the original series...let's just say it involves a dog and Kishimoto.  But of course, the heart of this series was the mysterious game and the amount of violence shown for an animated series.

When these humans, many who refuse to wear the suits that Gantz gives them, suffice to say, in the series they are slaughtered to death, blood and carnage everywhere.  In the film, there is carnage but the director makes things so dark, especially darken the blood that no one gags while watching.  You know that these poor people who lost their life are dead, but how badly...that is where the film doesn't go far into.

And for fans of the series, the lack of the sex and bloody violence in the film may be a bad thing.  For me, with any comic book adaptation, you know there are going to be changes.  ""Death Note"" was very different from the original series and since this film is from the producers of the ""Death Note"" films, who pretty much had to take the long story of the series and very loosely, create an adaptation to make two films out of it, the same can be said with Gantz.

It's loosely based on the series and if anything, the characters from the series are there and very few situations remain the same, but for the most part, its an entirely different story when compared to the manga and anime series and similar to ""Death Note"", the live-action films, you have to separate the live films from the manga/anime series.

As for the DVD, I did like the fact that they kept the special features separate on another disc but if you have a Blu-ray player and really want very good picture and audio quality, the Blu-ray release of ""Gantz"" is the way to go.  Otherwise, if you don't plan to upgrade to Blu-ray, ""Gantz"" still looks good on DVD and not everything is crammed to one disc.

As mentioned, they try to squeeze a lot into one film, especially the action sequences.  So, the character developing part of Kurono, Kato and Kojima, while we do understand Kato's connection to his brother, there is more to the Kato storyline than what was shown in the film and it's rather unfortunate that the film does lose the storyline connecting the viewer to these characters.  It's something that a manga series can focus on, especially a 26-episode anime series, but for a two-hour film, there is only so much you can incorporate and thus, the screenplay tries to fit in as much character development plots but focus primarily on the action.

And criticism of film adaptations of manga series is not just for ""Gantz"", it extends farther to other live action films including ""20th Century Boys"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Video Girl Ai"", ""Honey and Clover"", ""Death Note"", etc.  There is only so much you can incorporate into  a two-hour film and something has to suffer.  Fortunately, for Gantz, the film relies on its action than the dramatic elements of the series.

So, that is one positive for this film.  Focus on the action and if fans are able to separate themselves from the anime or manga series, then everything seems to work out OK.

Overall, ""GANTZ"" may not be the best film adaptation on a manga series but I have to admit that I had a lot of fun watching the film adaptation.  The fight against the alien in the car garage or the 100-arm Buddha, that was quite exciting.

If you are looking for an exciting Japanese popcorn action film or you are a fan who can separate themselves from the original storyline of the ""GANTZ"" anime and manga series, then definitely give the first ""GANTZ"" film a try!",1335571200,,7303,4.6433021806853585
4515431,3,B0050MB5JI,"I have never read the Gantz comic, nor seen the anime, so my only exposure to this series is the live-action movies.  I knew nothing of what to expect going into the film other than what I had read on the box cover.

Right from the start, ""Gantz"" feels like a comic adaptation rather than a movie.  In several of the scenes, I didn't know what was going on and I wondered if the director expected everyone to know the background from the comic series.  It didn't really matter though, because the film was soon head-over-heals in giant combat and I got the feeling that the ""why"" didn't matter very much.  This is a film that you have to shut off your logic-brain and go on pure Rule of Cool.

The concept is esoteric from the beginning: Random people are plucked from the verge of death and find themselves in a featureless room with a giant black ball in the middle.  The black ball--which we learn is named Gantz--tells them that their previous lives are over and their only option now is too battle aliens in some sort of game.  You get points for how you do in the alien game, and if you get to 100 points then you can chose to go back to your life, or resurrect someone who died during a previous game.  Gantz also supplies you with a supersuit and somewhat functionless weapons to carry out your task with.

""Gantz"" feels like a lot of different films.  There are obvious hints of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000HAB4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>.  There are some touches of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/20th-Century-Boys/dp/B002PHVHKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">20th Century Boys</a>, although both of those are much better films than ""Gantz.""  Stylistically, it looks good but it looks like a live-action cartoon rather than a movie. The monsters were interesting, and my favorites were the Deva guardian and the thousand-armed Kannon statues.  I liked the touches of Japanese mythology mixed into the Sci Fi action.  But there wasn't enough of this.  The aliens seemed to be wholly unconnected and just gave the protagonists something to fight.

The cast for ""Gantz"" was decent, but they rotated in and out so fast it was hard to get a grasp of any single character.  Lead actor Ninomiya Kazunari (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Letters-from-Iwo-Jima/dp/B00005JPKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Letters from Iwo Jima</a>) wasn't really compelling enough as Kurono Kei to carry the whole film.  Matsuyama Kenichi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kamui-Gaiden/dp/B0043988KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kamui Gaiden</a>) is a much stronger actor, although he was in a supporting role.  I thought that was kind of a waste.  Having Matsuyama front and center would have been a better choice. Yoshitaka Yuriko (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NEW-Kaiji-The-Ultimate-Gambler/dp/B003NEQ6YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NEW Kaiji: The Ultimate Gambler</a>) didn't seem to serve much purpose other than to fill out her form fitting suit, which she did rather well.

Overall, I enjoyed ""Gantz"" but wasn't blown away by it.  Even as a live-action anime film it pales beside ""Death Note"" and ""20th Century Boys.""  As a film in its own right it is some mindless but forgettable fun.

The DVD is a 2-disk set with some bonus footage and some interviews.  All of those are nice but not really enough of an addition to justify the second disk.  They probably could just have been included on the first disk as bonus features.",1333497600,,3805,5.870909090909091
4515432,5,B0050MB5JI,"I have read the manga and I have watched the anime, and Gantz the Movie is (mostly) faithful to its source material. The first few volumes of the source material. This is a good thing, too, because the manga is great. Or, at least it starts out great. After a while the aliens get so big and bad that it is almost ridiculous. And then the mangaka goes off an a tangent about vampires. And then the really big  aliens arrive and they put our heroes in the circus...

But this is not a review of the manga as a whole. This is a review of a film that does a very good job of demonstrating why Gantz the manga got off to a bang. So, I am giving it a big 5 stars.

4515458,4,B0050MB5JI,"That above statement is actually part of the optimistic Disney-ish jingle the Gantz orb emits just before assigning its alive again crew its latest mission, and that this jingle is a bit reminiscent of Uncle Walt's ""It's A Small World After All"" theme just adds to the creep factor. Because I do think that the Gantz entity has a sense of humor, only it's the dark, twisted sort. A sense of displacement is the mood the film is trying to evoke.

You'd perhaps be better served if you hadn't yet read the manga or seen the anime version of Hiroya Oku's GANTZ. Because this cinematic live-action adaptation comes watered-down. Hiroya Oku was trying to illustrate a point with GANTZ by making it such a depraved read. In the manga, the lead character, Kei Kurono, is a perverted person who gradually, so gradually, becomes a better person. The movie portrays Kei Kurono as a decent guy from jump, and so it right away loses depth and resonance and what would've been intriguing character conflict. We're left with watching shallow characters playing out their parts onscreen; it becomes a chore to invest in them.

When college student Kei Kurono and his juvie pal Masaru Kato rescue a drunk who'd collapsed onto the subway tracks, they become fatal victims of a hurtling train. But instead of the expected dirt nap, Kei and Kato find themselves in a room occupied by an enigmatic black sphere and other confused persons resurrected from the dead. The black sphere is the Gantz, an alien entity who issues the room's occupants hi-tech black suits and weapons and then deploys them to kill other and malevolent aliens. Gantz seems to treat this as a game, alloting a time limit to the missions and afterwards awarding points to the players based on its own whim.

For the participants, though, the risks are tremendous, the death toll ridiculously high. Amassing one hundred points gives one the choice of either freedom from Gantz or reviving a fallen comrade. It's a cool conceit that doesn't get explored in this film. Maybe it comes into play in the sequel GANTZ: PERFECT ANSWER. Except that this series of ""games"" is so damn bloody perilous that it's hard to picture anyone surviving long enough to accrue one hundred points. But if you've read the manga, then you know someone manages to do it.

The visual effects are wicked cool. The action sequences are staged dynamically. I didn't think much of the Onion alien, but the Boombox alien and the Buddha alien (with its multiple flashing swords!) are awesome. While the character aren't well developed, I do like the role switching which takes place between Kei and Kato. Kato is initially the heroic, take-charge guy, with Kei the more cautious one. But that gradually reverses itself as Kei learns that he's good at this game and as Kato's loathing for death and violence surfaces.

I admit that I'm a bit disappointed that the lewdness from the manga isn't translated onscreen. Believe it or not, that was part of the manga and the anime's draw. The characters and the situations in which they find themselves tend to be so bleak and deplorable that you're transported to this very dark place. This being a commercial effort, I guess I can see why they made Kei a wholesome protagonist. But, in the manga, the point of showing all the gratuitous violence and sex was to demonstrate Kei's growth as a human being and a leader. In this film version, we don't witness Kei's evolution or redemption. Still, this film, declawed and dumbed down and occasionally plodding, still comes recommended. Mostly, for the action bits. Also, see this with the English sub-titles. As other folks have already observed, the English dub is pretty silly.",1316995200,7,3689,4.821484992101106

Nice blu-ray transfer. Good film. Raw action. Breath-taking fight scene with giant majin type characters kind of reminds you of the majin fight scene in ""Sucker Punch"" but more intense. Bring on a blu-ray release for the sequel ""Gantz: Perfect Answer"".",1316649600,9,506,5.108433734939759
4515460,5,B0050MB5JI,"I must first say that this movie is an Salute, Tribute or Homage to the Anime Series so, with that being said its not for everybody. That's not a bad thing though, Because as a fan of the Series and as a person who was mad they cut the series after only 2 seasons I can gladly say I enjoyed watching the Live Action Version and comparing it to the Anime. Not everyone can handle seeing an animated show filled with Sex, Gore, Violence & a Sci-Fi story line all at once but, I sure can. If you do decide to get this Live Action version rest assured the US Blu-ray version is the best quality you can find. You get a 3 disc set at a good price and it has the DVD copy with it as well. IT has the Original Japanese Language as well as a English overdub. I personally could not stand the the English Dub and I just went for original language with really great subtitles. I know I'm not telling specific details about the film itself but, that's because I really want you to buy this Blu-ray or at least go grab the Anime. I Give this movie 5 Stars and an A++! So Go Buy it, Rent it, or borrow from a friend Its worth your time.",1315872000,21,1123,4.017857142857143
4515461,4,B0050MB5JI,The anime is my fav of all time! The live action version was good. Not as great as I thought it would have been. Ill watch it again. The ending was good too but there is a part two coming. If you liked the anime then you might enjoy the L.A. version.,1315353600,,250,3.826923076923077
4515462,5,B0050MB5JI,"It was good not as good as the manga but it had me on the edge of my seat. It's no Dororo live action but it's about as closer to the Manga then death note was, I just felt that atleast people died where they was suppose to in the movie which made it okay with me. I normally hate when I watch a Manga Live action and it's so screwed up compared to it's manga counterpart but this was Awesome worth watching.",1314835200,,408,3.927710843373494
4515463,5,B0050MB5JI,"This movie turned out much better than I anticipated! It managed to capture the feel of the comic, while still being accessable to gantz newcomers (my wife also enjoyed it.) The extreme content from the comic has also been toned down severely. While some may see that as a negative, the film makers HAD to do it to appeal to a larger audience. I believe it makes the viewing experience much more enjoyable. So, if you are a fan of Gantz, japanese cinema, or manga/anime in general, check out this movie! *WARNING: WATCH IN JAPANESE! THE ENGLISH DUB IS INCOMPREHENSIBLY TERRIBLE!*",1314748800,27,579,4.742574257425742
4515464,5,B0050MB5JI,for putting this much in one movie from the anime and the manga for a 2 hour+ movie it was awesome. alot had to be cut out but in the end i thought it was awesome for what they did. i like how they did the ball room with the actors up to the points of the action shots for a low budget movie they did alot in it. not much nudity if u read the manga or saw the anime. just blood action and gore...,1314748800,,396,3.616279069767442
4515465,5,B0050MB5JI,"As with many Asian imports the DVD menu is not that great. You have to select Gantz than move the mouse over to another option on the left for play movie. Not sure why playing the movie is two menu's deep.

Anyway, this is a minor annoyance, the movie itself is fantastic. Great storyline, great costumes. Even the dub voices aren't bad.

If you are a fan of Gantz manga or anime you will want this, and even if you haven't seen those and are just a fan of oddball sci fi movies, this is enjoyable.

Watch till the end of the credits and you will see the trailer for the sequel (which isn't out yet as I write this)

This disc also has a bonus anime series on it, I only glanced at it, and you have to turn on subtitles for English, it looks interested but haven't had time to watch it all the way through. It's a typical big robot brawler from the looks of it. (don't worry, Gantz the movie has English dub, it's only the bonus anime that needs subtitles and from the looks of the action there isn't much talking in it anyway, I skimmed it and it was alot of fights)

I think this is a Hong Kong release version on this page, the US versions are not out yet. There is also a more expensive Malaysian release version that comes with a nice slip cover, but those are like $10 more for the same movie.",1310169600,,1299,4.118577075098814
8451408,5,B0050MB5JI,"I got interested in Gantz after watching the Gantz: O movie. After watching the anime series and then reading the entire manga and now this movie I have to say the movies are better.

If you want a faithful live action adaptation of the manga then move along. For me it's a plus because the story is tighter and it addresses one of the glaring problems with this series and that's primarily how long it takes all the characters to stop standing there in disbelief, despite the other worldly technology and creatures right before their eyes, while they get themselves killed in the most stupid and contrived ways. It took ""horror movie stupidity"" to the next level. You won't find that in this movie.

You also won't find the gratuitous amount of nudity and gore this series is known for either, but it's still sort of there off screen or toned down.

Lastly, I'm surprised this movie had a dub, but for anyone wondering I did watch it dubbed and it's actually really good. And the Japanese actors do a great job. Acting in Asian movies can be pretty bad, but I enjoyed the performances.

If you are looking for a quick introduction to Gantz then this movie does a great job. It's rare for anime/manga live adaptations to be good, but this movie is better.",1503964800,,1255,4.539823008849558

8451415,5,B0050MB5JI,"I bought this DVD set a year and a half ago and finally got around to watching it today. This movie is pretty much a replica of the first half-dozen or so books of the original manga series.

At two and a half hours long, there's just way too much ground to cover so naturally some characters are cut and some plot elements are either revised or removed completely. The first three missions are there, so the film concludes after the Buddah temple mission.

There's a second film, ""Gantz II: Perfect Answer"", which takes the storyline on its own original thread. I haven't bought it yet but when I do I'll review it in 2019.

Best part of the entire film was when the Tanaka alien loses his cool when his boombox gets busted. That face. LOL.

If you're a fan of the Gantz manga or animated series, you should pick up this movie. And then watch it. Immediately.",1484006400,4,860,4.389937106918239
8451416,1,B0050MB5JI,"The movie had potential but it ended up as a bore.  There are action sequences but then they are interrupted by some kind of awkward drama acting moment.  I am not aware of the manga but I doubt they stop the action to have an Oscar clip to interrupt the scene.  Don't even care that there is a sequel.  I got this for the guy who played ""L"" in the Death Note movies.  Best scene was Onion Boy.",1464393600,,394,4.0
8451417,4,B0050MB5JI,"On its own, it's a pretty enjoyable movie. As an adaptation, it left me wanting more.

Criticisms:

Kei Kurono isn't the jerk he was in either the anime or manga, and his perverted nature is severely reduced to a cameo at the beginning of the movie.

Buddhist Temple mission. I get that it's a movie adaptation, but they gutted a lot of what made this particular mission so important in Kurono's character development.

Sei isn't in the movie. Despite her short run in the manga and anime, her character helped Kurono get where he needed to be at the end of the Buddhist Temple mission  (along with Kato, and Kishimoto).

Kojima Tae (or Tae Kojima). Her presence feels very forced in the movie, and her big line near the end feels like it came out of nowhere. She should have been saved for the sequel.

The English Dub. It's good for a laugh, but stick with the Japanese audio with subtitles (or no subs if you're able to understand Japanese) if you want to watch the movie seriously.

Praises:

Storytelling was pretty good, and despite all of the differences from the source material (there's really not that much difference in the important stuff), I found myself enjoying the movie quite a bit.

Acting. The main cast does a pretty good job of acting, but not always. The supporting cast is fairly passable.

Soundtrack. It's pretty good. It does a does a good job with bringing the movie to life.

Lack of the gratuitous nudity.  I like boobs as much as the next guy, but the manga and anime were pretty ""in your face"" with nudity and sex. In the movie, the nudity is still ""there"", but its mostly just a few shots of a woman's butt, or its shot in a way way you don't see any nipples or genitals.

The violence. While it pales in comparison to the anime or the manga, it's still there, and it's amazing how well it's done.

Special effects. Mostly good. Few exceptions that are a little off (in one scene, a man's leg is cut off and the way he bleeds felt a little off).

The missions (outside of the Buddhist temple mission feeling less important) are so good. The Suzuki Alien mission is incredibly fun to watch for the most part.

The ending, for the most part, was well done and sets up Perfect Answer nicely.

The rest of the movie is enjoyable for the most part, but nothing to get excited about, I think.",1464134400,3,2318,4.439716312056738
