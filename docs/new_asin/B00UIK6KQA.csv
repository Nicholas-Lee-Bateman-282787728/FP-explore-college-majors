I fear that I will, if I share my full reaction, sound like a babbling fool, but for art such as this I chuck my pride gladly and share my authentic utterly moved heart.  I cried like a baby watching it the first time, I felt like a child again, on Christmas morning when I still believed in Santa Claus, creeping out on silent kitten feet to behold the magic.  The potency and loveliness of this Great Work can scarce be conveyed in mere words.  Buy this, watch this, give Eleusyve all aid and support, they are gently yet insistently parting the Veil and bringing something wondrous through to shine in this world of forms.",1439078400,,677,4.524590163934426
8706970,5,B00UIK6KQA,"Aleister Crowley's The Rite of Mars is the fifth DVD production by Eleusyve Productions of Seattle Washington USA. I believe the mission of Eleusyve is to make accessible to the greater public Crowley's 'Rites of Eleusis' and they exceed at this par excellence! For the fan of Crowley's writings these DVDs are an excellent way of seeing the rites presented, along with the original violin pieces re-enacted by Seattle violin wizard Sunnie Larsen and strong impacting vocals by lead actor and musical composer Jon Sewell. For the non-fan you will still be treated to a presentation of interest never before put to stage in such a grand fashion as this. 5 star recommendation and highly recommended",1437696000,,697,5.017241379310345
