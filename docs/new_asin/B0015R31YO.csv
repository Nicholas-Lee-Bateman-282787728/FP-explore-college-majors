Whatever the history of the Iraq war from day one until the advent of Petraeus and Crocker, we are there and we need to get it right. The bad news is that much of it prior was not done right or well; the good news is that we do know how to do it right and given the opportunity can and will. As Cadet Kelly said, ""Fortunately, we're very good at this.""

The main theme of the program is that we are in what has been termed 4th Generation War; our opponents have no intention of playing by conventional rules of warfare (why should they?) and continually seek to exploit any weaknesses they detect. Unfortunately some here at home think that casualties are best prevented by increased layers of ninja turtle body armor and elephantine MRAPS; and best of all, going home early. The truth is that the solution, whether to an insurgency or street crime, is to get out and among the people, look them in the eye, drink coffee with them, and prove by actions that we are there for the long haul. Pretty low tech stuff. Rumbling down the street in an armored vehicle is the equivalent of a police car that never stops moving. The locals aren't going to talk to you much, ever--much less trust you.

I did get a kick out of the retired USMC colonel's comments, and the books he had casually and artfully stacked behind him: Boyd, Bernard Fall, John Poole.

I will probably watch the trilogy one more time and then give it to the local library. Mr. Johannes has done us all a great service.",1207699200,,1595,4.436860068259386
