8202749,5,B000RW5C72,"I can't click past these reviews without noting the comments of the high-school teacher who was disappointed that she chose C. Plummer's portrayal of Nabokov lecturing on Kafka instead of a dramatized version of the story itself. Before he/she criticizes her students before the fact for not being able to endure the Nabokov/Plummer lecture, perhaps the teacher should learn to sit still long enough to carefully read the text that clearly describes the film.",1392076800,2,459,5.216216216216216
8202750,1,B000RW5C72,"I was so disappointed when I realized that this was not a movie about Gregor Samsa, but a film about Nabokov reading and making comments on ""The Metamorphosis.""  I had planned on showing it to my 12th grade seniors, but once I saw it, I knew that they wouldn't be able to sit still.",1358640000,,282,4.222222222222222
8202751,5,B000RW5C72,"I first saw this at school, last school year ('07, '08) in my Literature class, when we had just finished 'The Metamorphosis'. Christopher Plummer's performance is stunning; simply the ease, for example, with which his imitation of Nabokov's rough, Russian voice comes across, stuns you. He is extremely funny as Nabokov. The lines are brilliant, and no matter what my friends said, there is absolutely nothing un-entertaining about it. I have learned many of the lines, from watching it, and can pull off a good impression. Only one thing: the sound and picture quality on the DVD (DVD! - not VHS - profesional, commercial DVD of a PBS broadcast!) is extremely colourful, yes, but the clarity is terrible for 1989, and the sound is as if it came from either a date long before the late 1980's, or a well-enhanced audiocassette. Still, despite the horrible sound quality, it is a masterpiece of simplicity and genius - the simple, and almost haunting cold violins and piano, perfectly capture the icy mood of this brilliant story. - Brilliant. I recommend this to every English class, that is studying Kafka or 'The Metamorphosis'. The script of this, is so good, it should be released, separately.",1224201600,15,1198,4.935643564356436
