8433523,5,B004KWVDZA,"Love this workout. A fan of Robert Sherman.  Like to hear the physiology explained.  Like the pace.  With ANY workout, you can rev it up or down; this one is perfect for me.  He cues beautifully, explains why, and is not overly chatty.  Have his other two cycling videos and recommend those, too.",1359072000,3,296,4.509433962264151
