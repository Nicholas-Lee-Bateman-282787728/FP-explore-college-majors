1661111,5,B00005TN87,"This mini-series certainly helped to pass the long days of summer vacation for me! Usually anything from Masterpiece Theatre is excellent--but this one surpassed many other mini-series they've done. The intertwining stories of all the members of the Cazalet family are artfully put together in such a way that it keeps the viewer constantly interested. The costumes were very true to the era and the jazzy theme music sounded like a real tune right out of the 1940's. Among the engrossing characters there were two who stood out the most. Louise, one of the young Cazalet daughters, had to struggle with a perverted father while trying to move up in the theatre. The other was Christopher, a Cazalet counsin who objected to the war. His father wanted him to join up, but he eventually has a breakdown because of it. If you love character sketches and period pieces, this one is for you!",1154476800,59,886,4.7973856209150325
1661112,4,B00005TN87,"I have always loved the cazalets, but this American release was rather annoying.

From the constant ""brought to you by ExxonMobil"" voice overs to the fireside-feel basic WW2 history blurbs delivered after each episode, there are additions in this version which are unnecessary and spoil the 'BBC Englishness' which I reasonably expected. (It seems odd that the history blurbs were not made into a separate added-feature, instead of being embedded in the episodes)

The Cazalets appears to be unavailable on amazon.co.uk, so any non-American buyers should be aware of the changes. If it weren't for them, this would be five stars - the sound and picture are great!",1151712000,24,663,5.12962962962963
1661113,4,B00005TN87,"I really did enjoy ""The Cazalets"" -- although, as other reviews indicate, it is left unfinished.  I don't believe there are any plans to complete the series, however, so one is handicapped by ridiculous cliffhangers, like the fate of Rupert.

I have not read the Elizabeth Jane Howard novels (although I would like to at some point), and due to that I found many of the characters difficult to follow -- for example, there is a distinct focus on only the eldest Cazalet grandchildren, Louise, Polly, and Clary, to the detriment of the others.  I believe Edward and Villy have a son, Edward Jr., who is hardly ever in the program.  Also, two of the Cazalet sons, Edward and Hugh, have younger children, who are never fully connected to their parents.  For example, I believe Lydia Cazalet was the daughter of Hugh and the long-suffering Sybil, but am not positive.  Also, Villy and Sybil also have infant children (who grow into toddlers as the series progresses), the names of whom I cannot even say I processed since they were so seldom seen or mentioned.  While I know this setup, i.e., having very young offfspring placed in the charge of nurses, governesses, and tutors (ah, the saintly Miss Millament!) was common among the upper crust, it made the family appear disjointed.  Finally, were Christopher and his mother related to the Cazalets?  I had a sense Mrs. Castle (Christopher's mother) was Villy Cazalet's sister, but, ONCE AGAIN, where was the solid evidence to support this...?!  N-O-W-H-E-R-E!!!

The acting was very well executed in this piece.  I agree that while life in World War II England couldn't have been as rosy for most people, even the upper classes (of which the Cazalets aren't even a proper part, as they are not members of the nobility or peerage), as the Cazalets enjoyed during that period, I was willing to overlook this suspension of fact in order to better appreciate the inter-familial drama.",1131667200,13,1928,4.844512195121951
1661114,4,B00005TN87,I agree with the other reviewers. it is a great story. I have read all the books twice and although the DVD is worth buying it is disappointing not to see the end of the Saga.,1122422400,24,175,3.888888888888889
1661115,4,B00005TN87,"I would have given this five stars if they had FINISHED THE DARN STORY!!! I fast forwarded after Louises wedding, Because it was obviously not the end right? but much to my chagrin,,,there was nothing else to be had! What happens to this family? where is Rupert? is he alive? what happens with christopher, and Zoe with the injured soldier? I cannot get the books easily, why make such a great series and NOT FINISH IT?",1121904000,19,419,4.526315789473684
1661116,5,B00005TN87,"The Cazalets is the story of a upper-class British family during WW II. I really liked it. You really get the feel that the characters are individuals and that their trials and tribulations are real. I particularly liked the stories of the young married wife Chloe and her relationship with the wounded soldier, and the friendships between the young cousins. I didn't care that much for the conscientious objector storyline that took up the third DVD. Perhaps if the character had been more endearing, but the kid was annoying, and the story took up way too much of the DVD. Overall, a good period drama. Too bad it isn't complete!",1116806400,18,631,4.745454545454545
1661117,4,B00005TN87,"This is the story of a large extended, relatively well-off British family from just before WWII up through the early years of the war. The film breaks off about half way through the war while the novels continue through until the end of the war. The way the film ends it feels as if the people making this intended to continue in another season, so it finishes with a lot of loose ends. Despite that fairly serious flaw, the superb character development and the rich range of very real individuals who range from young children to very elderly, from sleazy to incredibly noble and self-sacrificing, makes this something not to be missed. This is about the home front and is a bit more about the women than the men, but the male characters, I thought, were as well developed as the females. In the interest of not offending those who are more puritanical than I, I should mention that there is a very tender, very closeted lesbian relationship involving one family member. In addition, there is a male family member who is less than faithful to his wife. In neither case does much happen on camera. The Cazalet's are in the main generous and loving people. You will be glad you met them.  If they had continued with the rest of the story line from the novels, I would have given this 5 stars as a first installment.",1102550400,160,1314,4.5210084033613445
1661118,5,B00005TN87,"After gleefully investing six hours in the fabulous and riveting ""The Cazelets"", I was woefully disappointed that the video ends mid-story (let alone in the middle of WWII!), with so many plotlines in full throttle: will Rupert make it home from the war; will the Brig make it THROUGH the war; will Zoe and Roddy...? Well, I don't want to spoil it for you, dear viewer. Acting and production values are full-on, in the best Masterpiece Theatre traditions. The camera lingers on those details ( i.e. a bucket catching drips from a leaky skylight in the cozy-but-grand family compound) that add so much to believing you are a fly on the wall as the drama unfolds. I wish I knew whether there is a Part 2 that PBS just neglected to import or whether I will, of necessity, read the last two books. I HAVE to find out what happens!",1045440000,74,826,4.513333333333334
1661119,4,B00005TN87,"I enjoyed the TV series based on The Cazalet Chronicles, but I would advise reading the books, too. The script for the series modified the tone and seriousness of some aspects of the plot and diminished it in a disappointing way.

The casting for the TV series was excellent, though, and it was well worth watching.",1358294400,2,315,4.625
1661120,5,B00005TN87,"The series was very interesting even though the last episode was a great dissappointment -- so many topics were left unanswered.  It seems they either ran out of money or time, and finished the story very abruptly.  The ending was very incomplete, quite a disappointment. The acting was great by all.  Hugh the Bonneville was very good, as usual.  The producer and director should had been fired to have ended this drama in such a shabby manner.  I hope one day they will be able to finish it completely.",1355788800,,504,4.617977528089888
1661121,4,B00005TN87,"This is an interesting story set in England at the time of WW1.  It has many varied characters and is well done. It concerns a family of brothers, and their families, and reveals the contrast in the nature and behavior of the brothers.",1355356800,,235,4.465116279069767
1661122,1,B00005TN87,"This series could be re-named The Sex Lives and Scandals of the Cazalets. I only managed to watch an episode or two during which there were a few bits of fairly normal family life, a few sweet moments, a whole lot of people's obviously unhappy lives and a lot of Edward's affairs with other women (as is stated in the synopsis above he's married with a daughter). Unrelenting misery is not my idea of a good time!

Other reviewers have commented on the amount of sex - what I saw was tastefully done and generally hinted at the act more than showed it however, I stopped watching when Edward tried seducing his daughter whilst drunk so I cannot say how the series progresses from there.",1350950400,,686,4.488
1661123,4,B00005TN87,"I have always considered WWII to be in the modern era but it was 70 years ago so I guess The Cazalets qualifies as a ""period piece"".  In reading the other reviews it was amazing that there was such a difference of opinion regarding the show.  For me, the acting was great as was the attention to period detail.

I didn't see it when it originally aired on television.  The blurb on the case quoting the N.Y. Times says ""The Cazalets is the sort of family saga that American audiences have loved since Upstairs Downstairs.""  The difference in the two is the way they are formatted.  In Up/Down there was certainly a continuity to the episodes but each one told a self-contained story focusing on one or a few of the characters.  In that way you got to know all the characters in depth over the course of a season.  The Cazalets, on the other hand, is presented in soap opera style with multiple stories running concurrently throughout the series, switching back and forth between them within every episode.  The editing is well done and it works o.k. on dvd's where you can watch the whole series in a few evenings.  Also helpful is the fold-out built into the dvd case which shows the faces and names of the principal characters presented in a family tree diagram.  I referred to that several times.  Watching the series on t.v., one episode a week, must have been confusing.

A number of reviewers complained about the emphasis on sex.  There is a brief instance of nudity (upper female) in the first episode and lots of scenes with groping and pulling at clothes.  In later episodes other stories become more prominent.  In retrospect, I wonder if they included the suggestive scenes as a way of getting some publicity for the show?  It certainly is not suitable for children.

The only real complaint I have is that the show was not renewed for a second season.  It ends abruptly and you are left wondering what would have happened next.
I would recommend it to any Anglophile if you can get it for a reasonable price, about 10 to 12 dollars.",1348444800,,2045,4.553424657534246
1661124,1,B00005TN87,"I have heard that the novels by Elizabeth Jane Howard upon which this teleplay was based are quite good. Unfortunately, after watching this insipid series, I have no motivation to read them. Douglas Livingstone's screenplay was so lifeless, and the acting so stilted that it was nearly impossible to sit through the majority of these painfully dull episodes. The plot consisted of a string of extramarital affairs that were so boring one wonders why the participants bothered, sporadically interrupted by spoilt children whining ""I'm sick of being treated like a child!"" Frankly, it was impossible to care about such poorly drawn, two-dimensional characters, no matter how many temper tantrums they threw. Neither was there any real attempt at capturing the spirit of the times. In comparison to Foyle's War, which not only managed to bring the history of WWII in Britain to life, but developed believable, appealing characters - or Downton Abbey, which brilliantly conveyed the personal upheavals of its characters within the context of Britain's changing class structure, this series falls far short of the mark.",1346544000,,1114,5.299435028248587
1661125,1,B00005TN87,"The Masterpiece video version of the Cazalet Chronicles is a travesty!

It's not possible to collapse 1650 pages into 6 hours.  All those sex scenes, for example, did occur in the books, but not jammed one on top of the other (so to speak). A number of liaisons occur in the books, but they are not the dominant theme. To have twisted the narrative in that manner completely destroyed the many charms of the story.

Too bad the writers/producers didn't emulate the great success of the 1960s version of The Forsyte Saga - nearly 22 hours of pure delight, even though it is black and white.  (The later version of Forsyte - like Cazalet, shorter and in color - was also a mess.)

The four Cazalet volumes (Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion and Casting Off) are still available - although getting harder to find. Delightful read! I own two complete sets: the one I lend and the one I don't let out of my sight.

PS Anyone who has read Slipstream, Cazalet author Elizabeth Jane Howard's own story, may be surprised to learn how much of Cazalet was autobiographical.

PS - 8/12/12: In her memoir (just re-read it) Howard recounts her disappointment in the dramatized version of Cazalet. Originally, there were to have been 22 episodes, but the BBC chickened out.  Would that someone would give it another try!",1342828800,6,1308,4.681222707423581
1661126,5,B00005TN87,"I recently watched this mini-series for the first time on DVD. It was wonderful to see Hugh Bonneville featured in this WWII-era British family saga, after enjoying his performance in the first two seasons of ""Downton Abbey."" The production was superb, from the period costumes and settings, to the fine acting by an excellent cast.

My major disappointment is that the series went out of production before reaching the end of the tale as set out in the Cazalet Chronicles novels on which it's based. Having not read the books, I've now reserved them at the library, because I've become so interested in the story that I want to follow the characters through the war years and to the end of the saga.

Actually, I have another, milder, disappointment. Unlike the DVDs watched by a previous reviewer here, my DVD set didn't contain ""explicit"" ""sex scenes."" Not even close to ""porn.""",1342656000,,881,4.827814569536423
1661127,3,B00005TN87,"I have quite a HUGE library now of the PBS and Masterpiece Theatre moves and I love them all.
But this one and Song Bird have been a disappointment to me in regards to the sex scenes.
These are definitely not ones that I would pass on to my daughter or granddaughter's.
I'm not a prude, but I don't enjoy watching porn and there is a scene in the Song Bird that to me borders on porn.
The sex scenes in this movie were not exactly porn, but too explicit and totally unnecessary.

I have never been able to understand why a wonderful story has to be so explicit in the area of sex.  Whatever happened to ""using ones own imagination?

These two are are the first ever that I found offensive coming from Masterpiece Theatre and PBS.",1338422400,7,729,4.268115942028985
1661128,4,B00005TN87,"Good movie, of course the book was much better.  I wish I had seen it before Downton Abbey.  The comparison is not as flattering.  The Cazalets is not as artistic, but still a good story.",1330819200,,187,4.285714285714286
1661129,5,B00005TN87,"The BBC screened this superb series in the early years of 21st cent and I've been watching out for a video or DVD version of it ever since, and at last I tracked down an American seller via Amazon.  The rights must have been bought by the US company Masterpiece Theatre as the BBC never offered it for sale.  The series is based on the Cazalet family saga written by Elizabeth Jane Howard, and this version stars a young Hugh Bonneville as one of the 3 brothers who manage a timber business with their elderly father. Most of it is set in a large Sussex country house where the family live during the war, but there are scenes in wartime London. Plenty of intrigue caused by a philandering brother,a lesbian sister, a pacifist son, an aspiring actress daughter etc.  Very well acted and directed, lots of period atmosphere of the best sort (Downton Abbey on a smaller scale, but also similar to The Camomile Lawn: if you enjoyed that, you'll love this).  The packaged DVD took only around 2 weeks to arrive from the US.",1330819200,3,1019,4.491891891891892
1661130,3,B00005TN87,This mini series was mildly entertaining however the people portrayed in this movie were in want of some moral fiber.  One brother was a creepy womanizer another brother married a shallow woman who showed some redemption later.  There were a few characters that made it worth watching one brother in particular.

1661131,1,B00005TN87,"I was very disappointed in this series and turned it off before the first episode had even finished. It seemed to me every other scene was one of the various couples in bed. I am a huge fan of period pieces, but I felt this one was trying too hard to be some sexy soap opera rather than an intelligent drama. I will be sending it back.",1323475200,17,335,4.014925373134329
1661132,1,B00005TN87,This movie was filthy within the first 5 minutes.  I tried fast forwarding through those portions only to be disappointed.

1661134,1,B00005TN87,"The members of a very large cast each must face a spectacular moral dilemma or personal outrage.  How many of these incidents can be fitted into an hour?  I only watched Disk 1, I gave up.  Like other reviews, there are lots of far better wartime stories, try Foyle's War if you need a suggestion.  The Cazalets is a melodrama, maybe a little more disjointed and sordid due to hastily moving storyline arranged so every character can have a eye-popping crisis in each episode.  Bad script, poor story development, to be avoided not because it's too adult but because it's too childish and superficial.",1315008000,10,601,4.740384615384615

1661136,1,B00005TN87,"The Cazalet film version (i.e., this Masterpiece edition) does nothing positive for reputations. The whole feeling in it is one of false acting (overdone, contrived, poorly directed, not well-managed), inept script (expected lines - in the sense one watches and hears some dialogue and is able to predict exactly what the next-spoken cliche will be), and hot-potato-in-mouth accents (false parody - these are NOT how well-educated middle-class [and upper-middle-class] English speak normally - nor is it how they spoke in the late 1930s to early 1940s). My group watched the first three episodes but collectively decided to not continue with the 4th and 5th. In fact, by the middle of episode 2, our private theater became almost rowdy with groans and semi-catcalls as the Cazalet characters woodenly worked through the pathetic script; by the end of episode 3 we had had enough and sent the DVDs back to the shelves. We have seen other British presentations of similar period and have respected, enjoyed, and been educated by them (examples are Downton Abbey, Love in a Cold Climate, and so on, all of which so favorably impressed us, and were so well done, that we decided to purchase them for our permanent collection). But this Cazalet series is junk, bruises reputations all round, and astonishes us ... What were its producer/s, directorate, screenwriter/s and cast thinking?",1313280000,13,1381,5.142222222222222

The story centers around 3 brothers and their families and the struggles each one deals with. The director did a great job with this film. However, I have only one issue-the tremendous cliffhanger the viewer is left with! I want to know what happens with Rupert. Is he rescued to reunite with his family?? And I want to know how the marriage between Michael and Edward's daughter turns out (she was warned that he was ""a breaker of hearts""). I'd also like to know what ends up happening with Edward himself, does he acknowledge the illegitimate child he sired with his mistress? Does his mistress even decide to keep the baby? Does his daughter finally tell her mother (his wife) about her father's inappropriate behavior with her (I honestly feel that Edward was truly sorry and realized the error of his ways the second time he came on to his daughter)? Does a relationship finally occur for the two women who found themselves in love? So many unanswered questions. Makes you wonder if there could possibly, one day, be a sequel??

Imagine the delights that further await you in the remaining four.  Hardly a likeable character in the bunch; the kids are all criminally indulged and brats until the last episode when death, the great equalizer,  brings them together.

Out of all the characters, Hugh is the most likeable.  He adores his cancer stricken wife and he's faithful to her, something that his brother Edward cannot be to *his* wife.  Edward has a cigarette in his mouth in every scene unless he's holding a drink, although sometimes he has both.  [...].  Such a dilemma for the poor old chap.  Oh but he loves his daughter, you see.

Christopher, the ""conchie"", doesn't evoke sympathy, empathy or any kind of emotion other than annoyance.  I don't even know why time was wasted on this character.  He added nothing to the story except to take up space.  None of the characters were fully developed and the story ended leaving us hanging as to what happened to Rupert, for example, and even w/annoying Christopher.

Look for a character by the name of Mrs. Cripps, the cook, who's played by Jacqueline Tong from Upstairs Downstairs.  I recognized her voice before her face; time has not been kind to her.  We really weren't too privvy to what took place ""downstairs"" in this household, which I think would've been a darn sight more interesting than what took place upstairs, I can tell you.

7953587,4,B00005TN87,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, but like so many others, was also thoroughly disappointed that it was never completed.  That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. I knew the acting would be great with Stephen Dillane and Hugh Bonneville in it, and no member of the cast disappointed there.  I just cannot understand what could have caused the producers to cut it short.  I immediately got volume 4 from the library, which I am in the process of reading now, and will watch the video again when I finish, I think with a better understanding of the story, not the decision to leave it unfinished.  This is a wonderful depiction of a close family group going through the hardships leading up to WWII, the war inself, and the aftermath, with wonderful character development throughout.  I think anyone interested in history, excellent acting, and a darn good story would certainly enjoy this excellent production.  If only they had finished it!!!  Of course, reading the books would also provide even more background information to enhance your enjoyment.",1361664000,,1061,4.861111111111111
