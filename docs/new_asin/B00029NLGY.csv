2070298,4,B00029NLGY,"I saw this cute film a weekend before opening, during a local sneak preview, and let me say, it was great!
Wisconsin-born Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) thinks boys are a distraction.  In fact, she never dates, preferring to keep her mind on her pre-med college studies: she's worked hard for everything she's got!  Prince Edvard ""Eddie"" of Denmark (Luke Mably) has the opposite problem: he has grown up surrounded by wealth and privilege (having been groomed since birth to become the next ruler of his country).  Only thing is: he's not ready for the responsibility!
Along with his trusty servant/bodyguard Soren (Ben Miller), the Prince enrolls as a student at a Wisconsin college, in order to meet girls; he immediately sets off to the local hangout to find some.  It is there that he runs into Paige, who is working; she dislikes him from the start, as he acts as less than a gentleman to her. When Eddie comes along the next day and pairs up with her as her lab partner, she's not about to change her mind about him...after all, he's just a rich playboy.  Isn't he?
Although Eddie quickly realizes that she is the girl for him: the ONLY girl for him.  He apologizes for his earlier behavior and the two become friends, and then something more.  But when Paige discovers that her Eddie is actually Prince Edvard Valdemar Dangaard, soon to be 51st ruler of Denmark, she is understandably upset that he lied to her...but will she forgive him?  And if she does, will the Prince be able to convince his parents to accept a poor Wisconsin girl as the future queen of Denmark?
Running from the paparazzi, exploding lab chemicals, lawnmower races, and a royal procession, this movie is full of cute moments of excitement and fun!  For those of you with kids that are worried about content, there is barely any language in the film (one ""bloody"" and one ""I'm going to kick your a**""), and other than a few scenes in a bar hangout and some make-out scenses, it is very family friendly!
From the beautiful scenery and dream-like sequence of events (that come across VERY realistically), this romantic film is definitely worth the watch!  The chemistry and love that blossoms between Paige and Eddie is so sweet and believable that you can't help falling in love with the characters themselves, and wishing that every girl could end up with their Prince Charming and live happily ever after!",1080777600,17,2382,4.718072289156627
2070299,5,B00029NLGY,"Paige, a pre-med student from Wisconsin, is on the fast track toward her lifelong goals. Edward, the Crown Prince of Denmark, is trying to escape a life he never chose. Needing an escape from his royal life, Edward treks to Wisconsin and poses as ""Eddie,"" a college student. Now they've fallen in love and Edward is in line to become King. Paige has to choose between two dreams -- becoming a princess or the doctor she's always wanted to be. This is awesome!",1080518400,,459,4.542168674698795
2070300,4,B00029NLGY,"I saw a sneak preview of this film over the weekend.  I loved it (but I love romantic stories).  I just love Julia Stiles.  She is wonderful actress to watch.  This is a good film to see with your girlfriends.  If you just want to spend about 2hrs just enjoying yourself (and not having to think), you could go see this film.",1080518400,,325,4.17741935483871
2070301,1,B00029NLGY,"It was a love story between a Wisconsin girl played by Julia Stiles, who has planned her whole life and wants to be a doctor and work for Doctors Without Borders, and the Prince of Denmark, portrayed by British newcomer Luke Mably. He is wild in his ways, doesn't want to take life seriously in spite of the fact that he will become king one day. He just wants to get away from all of his royal duties.
So when he sees a tv advert selling the video Girls Gone Wild! he figures that all Wisconsin college girls take off their shirts when prompted to do so. He learns very quickly that it is not so at the school he transfers to and consequently meets Julia's character, Paige. He comes across as obnoxious and she can't tolerate him. But somehow he ingratiates himself with her and she melts.
It doesn't take long before they fall for each other and their world shatters when she finds out his big secret: he's really Prince Charming.
Now I have some issues with the storyline but I have a huge gripe with the weather situation in this movie. It seems that Wisconsin is warm, bright, sunny with clear skies and grass for Thanksgiving weekend. Somehow that doesn't seem right to me. It should be freakin' cold in Wisconsin at the end of November, right?
Oh and shortly after that, when Paige learns Eddie is really Prince Edward of Denmark, she decides to follow him to Denmark which, it turns out, is also warm, bright, sunny with clear skies.
Now I have a friend who just recently moved to Denmark from Barcelona and he tells me it's cold. A quick visit to the Yahoo.com Weather page tells me that it is currently 34 degrees farenheit which is darn almost freezing cold. So there is no way that she would be walking around in short sleeves and not seeing her breath floating in the air.
It doesn't take long for Paige to realize that she doesn't want to be a queen, that she really wants to be a doctor. So she gives the huge diamond ring back and heads back to Wisconsin.
I won't tell you what happens next because that would be pretty much telling you how it ended. But don't bother seeing it or even renting it. The ending isn't worth it.
Now while we were told at the beginning of the movie that this was a film in progress and that it hadn't been finalized, I believe that the version we saw was pretty much the final cut.
It was too long - almost two hours. It dragged a lot. The Paige character could have been played by anyone, Julia Stiles did not shine in this performance. Luke Mably was cute and attractive but he certainly didn't make me swoon like Matthew Goode did in Chasing Liberty. Matt looked like a movie star while Luke just seemed like an average guy. Plus, he's almost anorexic.",1077408000,20,2701,4.382470119521912

It's Wisconsin in November and everyone was running around in shirt sleeves. Anyone involved in this movie ever been to Wisconsin in November? I don't think so. The scenes of Denmark were beautiful but some of the American scenes were less than believable. Apart from the total lack of knowledge about the Midwest in the late fall, it was a cute movie and I liked the fact that the girl did not give up her dreams of being a doctor for the guy. He had to acknowledge what she wanted in life. The sequel of the movie ""Prince and Me 2"" however, was really silly and I don't recommend it. The actors did a great job, really sold their characters.",1423612800,2,796,4.385135135135135

But instead of working for a Professor to assist his/her research, she works at a bar during her senior year and still hopes John Hopkins would accept her application to medical school. And there's this spoiled brat who happens to be a Prince of a nobody cares country and who would be responsible for ""its future"". He chooses to come to Wisconsin to see college girls' boobs. And half way through the movie he changes for this girl who doesn't want any distractions. Suddenly, her aspirations to be a doctor disappear into thin air and she settles for being a crazy, irrational girl who believes in cheesy stuff like all we need for a happy life is a Prince charming. And as the print media doesn't have anything to do in Denmark they send all their photographers to take pictures of the Prince. The paparazzi conveniently enters the library when the couple decides to do it behind the stacks in library. And his cover blows. The girl is upset because the guy turned out to be a prince, she would have happily forsaken her dream of becoming a doctor had he been a normal guy. And a few days later she realizes she is meant to be with him.",1417305600,2,1294,4.487288135593221

Several scenes of drinking, including shots, sexual induendos, including attempted in a public place which was interupted, and advertising porn. I wouldn't feel comfortable having my kids watch this without a filter. Definitely not for younger kids thinking this is a cute ""princess"" movie.

2071257,1,B00029NLGY,"My husband and I started watching this, thinking it would be a good clean show, being more of a tween to teen show.  We were disappointed how alcohol and partying was portrayed as the 'norm' for young people.  We decided to stop watching it when the young man, ""the prince"", was watching television when a certain state and college in the United States was promoted with pornographic images of bare breasted young women, with ""censored"" across their chests.  Of course, the young man, created by the writers, told his unsuspecting father that he wanted to go to US schools to 'experience the culture'.  This, is not a family friendly movie.  We were looking for something that we didn't have to keep our finger on the remote to 'forward', skipping the parts we would rather not see.",1409702400,6,782,4.720588235294118

The plot is predictable, but that's acceptable given that this is a modern interpretation of a fairy tale.  The writing is  lacking.  There is no consistent characterization for Stiles' heroine.  There are no really good zings between the two when they are fighting.  There aren't any really funny moments, outside of a tractor race.  The first thirty minutes are really boring and the rest of the movie never makes up for the slow start.  Overall, the film is dull, flat and lackluster.",1407801600,,602,4.757281553398058

I was initially put off by how cheesy it looked, but it grew on me as I continued to watch. It became such a guilty pleasure, that I watched the sequel the next day! There is no denying it: this movie is so corny, in all of its 2004 glory, but there were so many cute and silly moments that it made up for the awkward parts I suppose. Just prepare to cringe at a few scenes, blush at a few others, and not take this too seriously. It was an enjoyable, light-hearted movie.",1407283200,,577,3.9827586206896552

There are better rom-coms out there for when you just need something to watch where you don't think.  This movie will make you think because you'll be so confused by all of the glaring errors (WHY is no one wearing a jacket or looking even a little cold in Wisconsin in the winter?  Why are the two main locations Copenhagen and Wisconsin, but it NEVER SNOWS and they always wear short sleeves??).  You'd be better off picking something else.",1404777600,,610,4.541284403669724

2071478,5,B00029NLGY,"I absolutely loved this movie. A lot of people here were saying it was a modern day fairy tale, but in the light of the actual Danish Crown Prince marrying Australian commoner in 2004 whom he met at the bar this story is not such a fairy tale after all.

Both lead actors did a great job, but Luke Mably was simply amazing. He had this royal aura about him as if he actually was of some noble origin. And considering that this movie was the first big movie he did in his career, he is nothing but truly superb. Julia Stiles was also very convincing as a regular american farm girl trying to get somewhere in life.

A lot of reviews also mention that the part where Paige decides to leave Eddie and go back home to pursue her dreams o becoming a doctor was abrupt and unexpected. Well, I disagree here. I think her decision was very ""legitimate"". I think, she was not feeling worthy filling in the role of the future Queen of Denmark when she didn't really achieve or accomplished anything in her life.

Besides, I watched the documentary on how the movie was made and I was amazed how much thinking and work is behind creating the film, portraying royalty as correctly as possible, educating actors accordingly etc. It is definitely not some sloppy movie put together to make some easy money off of a teenage romantic comedy.",1404259200,2,1325,4.444444444444445

2071524,1,B00029NLGY,"(Caveat:  Let me state right here that I only watched the first half hour of this turkey, so if there were any mind-blowing cinematic triumphs later, I missed them.)  I thought about giving this movie two stars because the Julia Stiles character is kind of appealing, but I just couldn't do it.  The set-up is a classic:  hard-working common girl meets privileged boy who has lost his way.  Her down-home wisdom straightens him out and they live happily ever after.  The problem is I found the boy not only unappealing, but moronic. He is willing to risk the lives of all those silly common folk for his entertainment.  Then, to make things worse, he apparently believes every YouTube/reality TV image he sees is a documentary about real life.  He goes to an American college town and wants to be incognito, but still has his manservant pull out his chair at the bar and take off his jacket for him.  But those are just supposed to be cute foibles, I guess.  We're supposed to be sympathetic because of his cold mother - who actually wants him to start being responsible.  So the character is such an exaggerated stereotype he's both repulsive and unbelievable.  FAIL",1401235200,,1167,4.694581280788177

This follows the usual Cinderella type plot line. They tried to put a modern twist on it. She wasn't going to marry him because she had her own dreams and wouldn't give them up for him.

I was surprised they used an actual country for the prince's home, Denmark. Denmark has no prince or king, so I guess that's why.

Although the story line is predictable, I really enjoyed seeing the Prince's character develop from a self-absorbed party snob to a hard-working, gentlemanly, dignified, young ruler. Didn't care for the girl as much, but she fit ok with the movie and theme.

Julia Stiles represents a hard working, intelligent young woman with a plan for her future. She refuses to be derailed by romance. Kudos.",1396828800,,390,4.735294117647059
2071636,3,B00029NLGY,"I gave this movie a 3 because it sits in that area that I consider a fun family-type movie. It is like many movies and doesn't stand out in any particular way (other than being fun and pleasant) that would rate either a higher or lower rating. Julia Stiles seems to get parts where she stands her ground for what she thinks is right but then either molds her antagonist into a better person or sees them as the better person that they are and falls for them. But she plays this role very well. In this movie she is the central actor. The plot is interesting: bad boy aristocrat goes slumming in a U.S. midwestern party school where some students are actually seeking a quality education, and finds more than he is bargaining for. Unlikely scenario and clearly trumped up in several ways to make the plot work, but you can disregard that because while they are doing it they inject the plot with some good humor and believable scenes. A nice Hollywood ending left me feeling good, though other endings would have been darker but more believable (and less happy). So, middle of the road, fun movie. I'd watch it again but don't think I'd put it in my collection.",1396742400,,1160,4.476415094339623

Along the way, the story shows a small town farm girl falling for Prince Charming before realizing he is indeed the worldly prince of his European homeland.  The movie is cute enough with out being sickeningly sweet, and the actors are talented enough to keep you engaged in the story.

2071685,4,B00029NLGY,"While the story is ""Fairy Tale"" based, it had more depth to it than that.  It gave insight into the lives of  royalty, and the difficulties such lives must endure.  It changes the paradigm and lets the viewer see the grass from the other side of the fence.  I'm a lover of romantic comedies, and loved this movie.  There is a scene, though, that I found discomforting, when she runs from the perils of royal life and leaves her true love out of fear and loss of self.  She got a down-to-earth view of the rigors such a royal lifestyle would impose.  I felt the loss, as if it were mine.  It was a ""two sides to every story"" kind of movie.

I also watched the added features, which were very impressive.  When I watch a movie, I don't look beyond what I'm watching to understand the work and expertise that goes into its making.  However, the added features give a much better understanding of what movie making is all about.  This was a very thought out and refined production.

The movie dropped out several times and by what I mean several times count 12 to 13 times we had to restart this movie. Watching this movie through Amazon Prime was a true test of patience. If fact, I'm not sure Amazon Prime is a good deal any more for us. We live in CT and now have to pay taxes on what we buy through Amazon since Amazon installed a distribution center in CT, as if CT doesn't get enough taxes already, and next year the Amazon Prime rate will be changed from nearly $70 dollars per year to nearly $100 dollars per year. We live on a fixed income so a 43% rise in rates in one year is pretty extreme for us. I really will have to rethink my position with Amazon Prime over this next year. I'm sure there other distributors that will offer good rates without taxes and extreme rates. I subscribe to Netflix so I really do not need to watch movies on Amazon Prime.",1395100800,,991,4.193717277486911

2071707,4,B00029NLGY,This movie is great and the leads have good chemistry.  The only reason not to give this movie five stars is because it is of course predictable and not exactly innovative.  Doesn't change the fact it's a fun movie.,1395014400,,215,4.487179487179487

2071711,3,B00029NLGY,This movie is worth watching but it does take itself a bit too seriously which is it's main downfall because the acting and plot while ok lacks the depth needed to make this plot really work. Also there are a number of plot holes which if I mention would be spoilers. Personally I prefer Coming to America which is a far superior Rom-com has a similar plot and is funny too. But if you're running out of good love stories to watch this is ok for a cold winter's night.,1394841600,,468,4.211111111111111

2071713,5,B00029NLGY,"I mean it deep down, everyone loves them at some point in their lives. People might grow to be jaded or even cynical but I refuse to believe that there are people out their who didn't love fairytales even as just a quick phase during childhood. In this world where the fantasy of meeting Prince Charming is being held in derision in the quest for empowerment, it's nice to see that there are ways to encourage girls to accomplish goals, be strong, and still let themselves be open to love and supporting a partner in their own goals and dreams too.

Life is meant to be shared, and maybe not for everyone in a romantic context, but with family and friends. This film is great because when we first meet Paige Morgan, she's shutting everything out. Forget romance, she can't talk about ANYTHING but her ambition to her best friends and family. Her tunnel-vision handicaps her career ambitions as well, because it's wrecking her humanities grades. See it's not just about the romance here. In order to truly succeed, we all need to be open to the world and people around us. That's the real message of this movie, and it's a good one for boys and girls. Being wrapped up in yourself brings failure.

This is something Prince Edward and Paige learn by opening up first to one-another, and then to their own destinies. They make each other better people, which is why for all it's corniness and fantasy the relationship works. Again, it's not the fact that they fall in love that makes their relationship special, it's the fact that they bring out the best in each other, and everyone needs people like that in their lives in any capacity.

But enough moralizing. This movie's just buckets full of sap, wit, and romance, and I just eat it up!

I've been a fan of Ms. Styles for years, and to see this accomplished Shakespearean Actress, and ballerina, play a Bard hating, graceless, science geek was just awesome. She is so genuine, so unabashedly full of sincerity and conviction that I beg you to ignore all of the sequels in this series! Without her playing Paige, they're just not worth it!

Luke Malby... (sigh) LOL I mean: he's cute, he's got the accent, he's talented, really how can a girl not sigh? I should be getting too old for such things but I can't help it. There's just something so endearing about how he plays Edward that even at his height of Jackassery, (""this isn't my first indiscretion"")you never forget that there is a good heart underneath all that spoilt self-doubt.  It's not easy playing royalty, one has to cultivate an almost indescribable aura, and he's got it! Whether it's a gift of nature or his own hard work, he managed to convince the staff of an upscale restaurant that he was an actual prince during off hours! This innate aura is yet another reason why I couldn't sit through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-Me-2/dp/B001GS2L20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince & Me 2</a>&nbsp;because in that film, he was the ONLY person with the aura! I always say that what makes an actor do well in a role is their sincerity, and their conviction. In this installment Mr. Malby had it in spades, in part two, not-so-much, but I can't blame him.

Miranda Richardson, as the Queen of Denmark has great impact for such a small role. She also has the illusive royal aura about her and I personally loved the fact that the costume designer went really BIG with the wardrobe and added a touch of whimsy to echo the style of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe of Denmark. Granted, this film is most certainly NOT about the Danish Royal Family, (even though Crown Prince Fredrick did indeed marry a ""commoner"") but it's still a nice touch.

Truthfully speaking though, one secondary character did steal the show and that was long-suffering Soren, played by Ben Miller. We all know that sometimes being the ""Straight Man"" in a comedy is a thankless job. Not here, Mr. Miller endows Soren with a biting wit from his very first line. You feel sympathy for him because he has to constantly follow Edward around, cleaning up his messes both literally and metaphorically. Yet, you also are touched by his loyalty and his affection for his wayward charge. Even at the peak of frustration, Soren never gives up on Edward or forgets the good in him. And, when real life gets slightly confusing for the lad, he's always there to translate and nudge in the right direction. Again this is where I say avoid the sequels. I ADORE Jonathan Firth! He played a dang fine Prince Albert in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victoria-Albert/dp/B00005O7N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victoria & Albert</a>&nbsp;but nobody can play Soren as well as Mr. Miller.

Now here's where I get shallow... Costumes and jewelry OMG. I'm just going to say I want it ALL! Seriously, for a frothy romantic comedy the clothes were heartbreakingly superb! Oh just once I would love to dress up in such lovely things. Jewelry... I saw this movie the first time in the theater when it came out and I literally hyperventilated. My father grew concerned. If their are any fashion students out there, just watch this for the costumes.

All in all, I say to anyone who might say they don't love fairytales please try this. Maybe if you look beyond the surface of Princes and Romance you'll discover that at their core, they really just try to teach us to be the best versions of ourselves.",1394755200,,5451,4.857911733046286

2071761,3,B00029NLGY,Not too cheesy and lots of fun if you are from the upper Midwest as I am. And the lawn tractor races were a revelation.,1393804800,,119,3.8
2071762,5,B00029NLGY,Engaging plot.  Funny and also serious.  The scenery and locations makes one believe it could actually be true.  Characters and dialog are believable.,1393804800,,150,5.434782608695652
2071763,4,B00029NLGY,Really fun story. Acting was not the greatest at times but still very enjoyable. Definitely a chick flick. Would probably watch it again.,1393804800,,137,5.0
2071764,3,B00029NLGY,It was fun and very predictable. Very much a Cinderella type story. A one time forgettable movie but glad I watched it.,1393804800,,119,4.454545454545454
2071765,5,B00029NLGY,"Though this film is formulaic in the extreme and contains the usual beautiful people, it is nonetheless sweet, charming and is beautifully directed by a person who actually believes in the beauty she sees.  Julia Stiles is wonderful and intelligent as the driven student and the prince, though somewhat cardboard, is nice to look at and ably portrayed (even through the miracle metamorphosis). If you have an afternoon to kill and you wish to watch something pretty and pleasing--and not too taxing, this would be a good film for you.",1393718400,,534,4.933333333333334
2071766,2,B00029NLGY,"the movie was pretty predictable, and the acting is marginal.  over all it is a light hearted, chick flick with very little chemistry.",1393718400,,134,4.826086956521739
2071767,3,B00029NLGY,"I watched this movie when it came out in theaters and I hated it. Now, years later, I had the urge to watch it again.  I didn't absolutely hate it like I did years ago (which is only because it didn't make me hate Julia Stiles all over again due to an unhealthy love of Dexter) but I didn't end the movie feeling like I loved it or hated it, just indifferent to it.  A major point of contention I had with the movie in high school (when I last watched it) was my hatred of her dress for the coronation.  They spent all this time and had a huge designer that boasted that she could create anything (including Chanel and McQueen) and THAT is what they came up with? That hot mess of 5 different colors and.... well, after several years (most of which were spent with subscriptions to Vogue) I actually love that dress and it isn't as awful as I once imagine it was. It's not the mess that was Molly Ringwald's Pretty In Pink dress that I still hate to this day (In fact I have a hard time with that movie because of that dress... and the guy).
I now like - and more fully understand - Paige running away to retain some semblance of her own identity and her own goals and dreams.  She doesn't want to walk and bow behind her boyfriend just because he's rich or famous or beautiful or all three (I'm looking at you 'she-who-cannot-exist-without-a-man-Bella-Swan').
But the thing that always made me hate this movie is still there. Still so cheesy and ridiculous and awful... That freaking butterfly! I blocked it out, I must have, or else I wouldn't have let the urge to watch it overpower me in such a way.  Was he holding the butterfly the entire time? Do butterflies just come standard with engagement rings? Is there a royal butterfly trainer? It's such a ridiculous, albeit small part, of the movie that I just can't handle it.  I've never understood the romanticism of the butterfly (they're just a bug to me).  But there's no real significance to the butterfly, just that one scene where he presents the ring... and a bug.  And then it's in a jar in her room.  Didn't it fly off to freedom after being trapped in his sweaty hand for 20 minutes, probably praying to whatever deity butterflies pray to that he wouldn't crush it (never mind the fact that the oils from his hands would have ruined it's wings and it never would have flown again).  Was his creepy little man servant hanging out, just out of sight, with a butterfly net so she could have it as a pet? A weird little reminder that her fiance is truly the cheesiest man EVER?
I still don't like it, but I don't hate it anymore...",1393718400,,2591,4.356846473029045

If you're feeling overwhelmed by all the items on your ""to do"" list and really stressed out over a whole bunch of difficult things in life, you will feel relaxed, refreshed and find renewed energy the day after watching it. It's romantic, pleasant but light comedy and might even make you shed some ""happy"" tears. Netflix, Amazon and iTunes all carry this movie. If it were possible, I would have given it 10 stars instead of 5/5. I plan to watch the entire movie again tomorrow <3",1393632000,,595,4.730769230769231

Okay I have learned to just shrug and accept it as ""mandatory"". Julia Stiles and her prince will certainly act in more movies. My ""best scene"" was when during that groundbreaking scene she used the shovel like it was meant to be. I laughed hard about her saying that she's just a farm girl. - We need more movies like this one!",1393545600,,460,4.621951219512195
2071771,4,B00029NLGY,"I know this story is about as unrealistic as Pretty Woman, but I think it's a lot of fun. I like the characters. I don't think it's overly farfetched. Julia Stiles is awesome at portraying a young woman torn between love and career choices.",1393545600,,240,4.4772727272727275
2071772,5,B00029NLGY,"I love how the main character Paige is driven and wants her own career. I also love that it's not the usual rom com, there are some unexpected elements in this movie.

2071784,4,B00029NLGY,A modern fairy tale where the heroine doesn't nullify herself for the sake of marriage in the end. Very enjoyable.,1393545600,,114,4.75
2071785,5,B00029NLGY,Great movie!  Humorous lighthearted movie. It gives you a feeling that anything is possible for love. It's a family-friendly movie.,1393545600,,131,5.55

2071789,4,B00029NLGY,"I thought this was a very interesting fairy tale told in modern times.  I guess it has happened before, but I had not heard of it happening and the girl has been allowed to keep her educational dreams and aspirations.",1393459200,,217,4.425
2071790,4,B00029NLGY,"I love this movie.  Yes, it's sappy but along with usual girl gets boy she also gets to keep her dreams and he learns humility.  Something that a lot of guys no nothing about.  I vote for love like that anytime.",1393459200,,211,4.097560975609756
2071791,4,B00029NLGY,"Entertaining, if formulaic. Enjoyed watching it.
It is not a Cinderella story, by any means, much more of a modern comedy with no heavy duty villans. Both my wife and I commented on how much we enjoyed the family of the primer character. They were delightful, even with a very small part of the movie.",1393459200,,301,4.490909090909091

There are some funny moments -- think arrogant prince rooming with John Belushi -- but the story feels like an opportunity to put Stiles into some glam gowns (she looks great) and dance with a prince. Plot is predictable, acting is flat, but the bodyguard provides amusement.",1393372800,,369,4.6923076923076925

I like to watch movies before I allow the kids to watch and the only thing I don't love (as it is geared to tweens) is that there is a few kissing/provocative type scenes and then there is beer/college bar scenes.  Not over the top, but just enough where I don't just love it...",1393372800,,333,4.107692307692307

2071798,2,B00029NLGY,"I loaded this and watched about 10 minutes of it.  Seemed like a half hour, with intercutting road races. The heroine was in a hurry to get where she was going and was trying to get past a series of farm vehicles. The hero, who did not look anything like he does on the cover (not that that matters.  I mention it because I may be mistaken this was the hero) was racing some brat pack he runs with on a wager, it is to be supposed.  This might have been interesting, but the camera cut back and forth between these two races for an inexcusably long time, while introductory credits were running overwritten. I've seen such techniques tried before, with much better success. This was just annoying and it felt like the story would never really get started, so I quit watching it.  One might say, ""Well of course you did, you impatient, spoiled American.  This was Prime, so you could fluff it off."" But had I paid to rent this movie I would have done the same.  It wasn't worth my time.",1393372800,,985,4.326086956521739

  It is about growing up and finding yourself but more importantly it is about sticking to your principals and your path in life, so this is a great movie for young and maybe not so young to see!!

 She never sold out, and neither did he.  I respect this movie because it is not too silly and you get to see a woman not compromising in a very healthy way.  This movie surprised me.  Even with an unexpected and good ending... that did make me feel good.

I think it was filmed in Romania or somewhere like that where there's less people and more castles still abounding. If you look close enough you'll even be seeing that the director repeat scenes from other parts of the movie to save on the budget. Having said that, it does have its redeeming quality with relatively good acting and a good premise. This movie goes ""for all the marbles"".

The main character, Paige, is true to her values and goals, while being true to her heart. In so many movies, we are given the impossible and the improbable and told that (we) women must give up who they are and their dreams, in order to win a golden cage and with it the perfect man. A male main character willing to wait for her to become who she needs to be is a breath of fresh air.

I rarely enjoy romantic comedies or tales of winning the prince, but this movie where the women having strong internal compass, and a voice, and a goal is lovely. Together or apart or a lovely third option?  It is a a little sweet and a little silly and just plain nice. It has a fun soundtrack, too.",1392768000,,808,4.166666666666667

2071845,4,B00029NLGY,I enjoyed the movie on a snowy afternoon.  It was cute and I enjoy early Julia Stiles.  Give it a try.,1392595200,,102,3.8095238095238093
2071846,5,B00029NLGY,"Yes, it's a chick flick, and you should have expected that from the title (let alone if you would watch a trailer.) It is, however, really good. Though the use of royalty-going-undercover isn't going to be a unique plot, this movie made it unique. You definitely don't see the end coming, and it wasn't thoroughly inappropriate. It was hilarious and I have loved it since the first time I saw it. Definitely worth 5 stars.",1392508800,,422,4.64
2071847,3,B00029NLGY,"I doubt that this movie will win any awards. It's enjoyable, has some funny segments, and a somewhat interesting plot. It provides a pleasant way to spend almost two hours, but it's not a classic.",1392508800,,196,4.628571428571429
2071848,5,B00029NLGY,"This movie is easy to watch, it may be a little transparent but it provides a perfect example of how difficult love can be and yet shows the splendor of love.",1392508800,,158,4.129032258064516
2071849,5,B00029NLGY,Good fun movie. If you need a little pick me up then this is a good movie for you to pick.,1392508800,,90,3.3333333333333335

2071851,4,B00029NLGY,"Great modern day fairy tale, giving both sides of the story then bringing them together. The movie could have been longer, and I wouldn't have minded.",1392422400,,150,4.8076923076923075
2071852,5,B00029NLGY,"It was very a typical, but nonetheless a beautiful charming love story - but the ending was quite different.  I liked it.",1392422400,,121,4.5
2071853,1,B00029NLGY,I thought is would be a lighter story then it was so I didn't continue to watch it. not my bag,1392422400,,94,3.5238095238095237

2071855,4,B00029NLGY,It was nice to sit back and watch a movie that was entertaining. It was light and fun to watch.  I needed to watch something relaxing- an escape from the stresses of life- and this fit perfectly.,1392422400,,195,4.27027027027027

2071857,5,B00029NLGY,I've enjoyed this movie for a long time. It is a classic love story. Watched with my parents and we all enjoyed it.,1392422400,,115,4.043478260869565

2071860,3,B00029NLGY,"Sometimes you're just in the mood to watch a formulaic, crappy movie. This fit the bill. Julia Stiles is a good actress and made the movie watchable..",1392422400,,150,4.592592592592593
2071861,5,B00029NLGY,"My daughter liked it greatly, she liked the lead actress, and how strong she was, she is disappointed the follow up movie is lacking the leading lady",1392336000,,149,4.555555555555555
2071862,3,B00029NLGY,"Okay, so it's predictable.  The movie is still a fun watch and Julia Stiles is generally a safe bet for a good performance.  It's nice that it wasn't all about the physical relationship; in fact, kissing is a pretty big deal in this movie, in spite of the fact that these are college-aged kids, not high schoolers.

A few picks: Edward obviously understood more than he was given credit for all along.  It would have been nice to see that hinted at.  Zorin's weekend alone was overdone.

Otherwise, it's a light, easy watch.",1392336000,,524,4.580645161290323
2071863,5,B00029NLGY,I'm not really the romantic type but for some reason this is one of my favorite chick flicks! Who doesn't want a Prince to sweep them off their feet?!,1392336000,,150,4.206896551724138

2071866,5,B00029NLGY,I have always liked Julia Stiles.  I this 2 really clicked. The other actresses in the next movies just didn't work right together. Love this movie though!,1392249600,,155,4.7407407407407405

2071868,3,B00029NLGY,This is a very nice Cinderella-type romance movie with an updated plot.  Settings and acting are decent.  Great for tweens.,1392249600,,123,5.1

2071872,4,B00029NLGY,"I really liked this coming of age movie.  Great for teens, especially young girls who still dream of a fairy-tale ending.  It is light and serious when needed.  Grown up issues are explained in a way that young people could easily understand.  This movie is serious fun for family and teens.",1392163200,,291,4.647058823529412

2071876,2,B00029NLGY,"I was hoping to see something with some depth if even a little lighthearted. I was disappointed with the tale. The prince was unbelievable in his too American, spoiled brat persona (definitely due to the storyline), and his character development was out of proportion to the stimulus and time suggested. What was even more incredible to me was the completely selfish attitudes that seemed to motivate the star actress, what a selfish bitch, according to the storyline. And what a conclusion, a prince of a country becomes king and is going to wait years while the object of his desire is going to finish college, go to medical school, finish up all she needs to be a doctor, then go to serve Doctors without Borders on several countries. Ridiculous.",1392163200,,749,4.813953488372093
2071877,3,B00029NLGY,"This movie was ok but has nothing that I would rave about.  The characters are not very realistic or engaging.
The actress lacks the personality and carriage to carry off the role of a would be princess,  Has some redeeming value towards the end but not enough for me to give it a higher rating.",1392163200,,295,4.345454545454546
2071878,1,B00029NLGY,This movie has a great plot and idea. The problem is the writers just put to many unrealistic scenes and plots. I felt like I was watching a cartoon movie instead of an incident that really happened.,1392076800,,199,4.405405405405405
2071879,5,B00029NLGY,"Sometimes you need a feel good movie.  I love this one.  As one who lived in a state that has winter, I love the error the director made in shooting the Thanksgiving shots on a northern State Farm with leaves on the trees and green feeds.

2071880,5,B00029NLGY,"What could have easily become a ridiculous farce is, instead, brilliantly directed and performed so much that one can believe this situation to be possible.

2071882,3,B00029NLGY,The movie is quite romantic and entertaining. ...gives one a hopeful dreamy romantic dream. Suitable for young gorls - and  teenagers.,1391990400,,134,5.380952380952381
2071883,5,B00029NLGY,"I decided to give this a try one night when there was little else to see on television.  What a gem it turned out to be!  Definitely a young American girl's fairy tale. A foreign prince visits America and falls for a Wisconsin farm girl.  Predictable? Probably.  But it's ideal to share with a teen girl.  Entertaining, sweet and romantic; without gratuitous sex - just as any fairy tale ought to be.  Gather your daughters, nieces and their friends for a sleep over and show this movie ... they'll be glad you did!",1391990400,,515,4.483870967741935

2071885,4,B00029NLGY,"Cute, light, edge of cheesy, fairy tale movie where Julia Stiles plays hard to get, then realizes she's falling in love, then runs away from love, then falls in love for real... All with a guy she doesn't realize is the prince of Denmark.  I  studied abroad in Copenhagen for a year, and oddly enough was senior in college when this movie came out and never saw it, so it was fun to see some of the city / hear some Danish over the course of the movie.",1391990400,,452,4.125

2071887,4,B00029NLGY,It is enjoyable to watch the play between Julia and Luke and believable enough the tension between them.  But can't put my finger on what keeps me from giving a five star.  The casting was spot on for most characters. Luke was especially good. The one scene in the stacks was odd with one scene break that for me was noticible wrong.  Outside that light cute romance story.,1391990400,,373,4.455882352941177

2071912,4,B00029NLGY,Like most the sequels just don't do it justice. The original is cute and fun at the same time. So if you are looking for a less expensive movie to rent or buy this would be a good choice as it never has hit the radar of hits.,1391299200,,225,3.7083333333333335

2071918,5,B00029NLGY,Great actors as young adults. A modern fairy tale. Everyone is always looking for their prince or princess in life. The movie also shows that life is not perfect all the time. Entertaining and for everyone to watch.,1386720000,,215,4.684210526315789

2071945,1,B00029NLGY,"My husband and I watched the Prince and me 2 first. That movie was clearly benign. Language wasn't slanderous conversations about things only to be in marriage or with your doctor never came up. I had no worry in finding myself in the middle of a porn addiction. This movie is filled with it. It has loads of crass, and slanderous language. This movie is one that not even adults should watch. I knew a wife of an attorney. He worked with sex offenders all the time in his line of work. He said that those who did this crime started watching movies like this one and eventually exposed themselves to more and more. They then went and began acting on this sex addiction and eventually started with adults and moved onto deeply destroying children. She said that every criminal he worked with principally had the same story. We did not finish this movie and we did not watch very much either. I am sure you can see why.",1382227200,,917,4.431952662721893

2071947,5,B00029NLGY,"This is a great movie. Usually I don't like chick flicks, but this one was just the perfect amount of funny, cheesy, and sad to be worth watching over and over again. My boyfriend even liked it :D",1379203200,,196,4.184210526315789
2071948,4,B00029NLGY,I like the farrier tale that Evert girl dreams of for her prince. A modern day twist on a classic,1378857600,,97,3.9
2071949,2,B00029NLGY,"When I read the description of this movie, I thought it sounded kind of fun and romantic.  Didn't get through very far before I turned it off.  Was tired of the lewdness.  Since I didn't watch much more than about 20 minutes of this movie, I can only say that what could have been really a fun plot was ruined by the content.",1378771200,,325,4.126984126984127
2071950,4,B00029NLGY,I like stories that put poor and rich people together. The fun part is that they meet by accident and the Prince has to learn to be poor. Then she has to learn to be rich; so their love can thrive. Cute story.,1378512000,,209,3.883720930232558

2071972,2,B00029NLGY,"Don't be fooled by the trailer.  This must have been one of Julia Styles's first movies.  It was as if the director said, ""When he stops talking, then you can start."" And not just Julia, all the actors were bad.",1377648000,,211,4.25
2071973,4,B00029NLGY,Cute and clean movie.  Much better than Prince & Me 2.  I would recommend it for teens and families.  Enjoy,1377561600,,107,4.25
2071974,2,B00029NLGY,"Overall, it was an okay movie because I liked Luke Mably's character as the prince, and I love Julia Stiles, but I hated the character she played in this movie. This character felt like the typical female type that you'll find in some or most simplistic chick flicks like this one. She's driven, ambitious, and strong in her academic career, but that is all she cares about. In a certain part of the movie where she has a choice to stop and think carefully about what the prince has to say when their relationship is discovered, she flips her crap, and just leaves him there, which I don't really understand from a woman's or anyone's perspective. If she actually cared about him as a friend or anything at all, she would have just gave him five minutes to explain himself instead running off. Later on in the story when she meets the prince's family, she has a very normal moment of insecurity, but because of that single moment because she doesn't feel fulfilled, she flips her crap again and runs away from him and his family like it's no big deal.

After all of the times she's ran away from him, this chick does not deserve a third chance.

In stories like this, I get that it's important that women are depicted as strong and independent, but why can't there ever be a time when they pick love and family and still be viewed as strong and independent and fulfilled with their life? If they pick love and family, why do they have to see it as their life being put on hold? Life never stops even if you fall in love or start a family. It doesn't stop for a man, so why would it ever stop if your woman? In any case, life should get better. This is why I hated Julia Stiles's character.

The story was slow in the beginning, interesting at 2/4, fast at 3/4, and terrible and hurried at the end. I paid $3 for this movie in instant renting to pass time, and I want my money back, and my time. I can see why Julia Stiles didn't stick around for number 2. The storyline could have been much more interesting if they just...wrote it in an entirely different way.",1374624000,2,2061,4.33419689119171

The chemistry between the leads was palpable almost from the beginning, particularly on his part.  That the Danish queen would be won over so easily is quite a stretch--often traditions are more important to those who marry into the role.  Of course I couldn't complete  this review without commenting that he's quite a dreamboat.  My experience with this genre is that the Prince Charming in the other stories is a two-dimensional role, stiff and showing off the sparkle of his teeth or eyes.  This movie PC is quite a 3-D portrayal.  His final scene shows the kind of emotion that would make for a good relationship in a high stress environment.  Bravo! that he'd entertain the notion of his queen being allowed to pursue her own dreams.

2072047,3,B00029NLGY,"This movie is a kind of Valentine to all those ordinary women and girls who've daydreamed about meeting and marrying a Prince.  I like Luke Mably's performance as Edward.  With his passing resemblance to younger British royals, he's easy on the eye, and the viewer does get a sense that he matures from being the doofish, selfish, rover-boy he is in the beginning, into someone who's actually capable of ruling a country.  But I'm not too keen on Julia Stiles's performance.  Her face and manner are curiously stiff, even when she's upset and crying.  As the compelling reason for the Prince's growing up, she brings all the intelligent, sensible, no-nonsense strength to her character that's required, but the ""swept away by her feelings"" half of her performance that should be there too, is lacking.  I like her best when she's learning to know Edward while they're at college - particularly, the Shakespeare scene in the laundry room.  But I have to talk myself into believing that (SPOILER ALERT) she's so in love with Edward that she runs away from her life in the U.S. to be with him.  Perhaps because she's been SO unbending until that point, she doesn't entirely project the softer, lovable and loving side of her character in equal parts.  (END SPOILER)

The best sections of the movie are when the characters are slowly learning about each other, talking to each other and reacting to different situations.  The story is easy to enjoy as a fairytale, but the screenwriter also captured some realistic relationship cues, which give it some depth.  I always thought with a different young actress in the lead, it might have been, for me, a totally captivating romantic film.",1334966400,,1682,4.863157894736842

We loved this movie and will definitely watch it again!",1313107200,,362,4.114285714285714
2072053,4,B00029NLGY,"First of all -- I like this movie. It is a PG rated chick-flick. So, if you don't like romantic comedies that are cheesy and more 'cute' than dramatic, I definitely doubt you will want to watch The Prince and Me. I do believe that if the rating was raised to PG-13, along with added drama with more depth, and a more complicated story line - the movie could have been improved from just being a teen flick. Julia Stiles and Luke Mably carry the plot line well, though, once again I think that they could have handled a more serious outlook on the same story. The more minor actors were chosen very well, especially the roles of Soren, Queen Rosalind, and Princess Arabella.

I have seen the sequels to The Prince and Me, and I must say, that the sequels are nowhere near as good as the original. As is almost always the case. Even the second film is nothing in comparison, especially because of the change of cast. Even if they couldn't help losing most of the cast, I think that it was a mistake to do a sequel without Julia Stiles - but with Luke Mably. Because throughout the film, it almost seems as though Edvard ended up with someone else besides Paige, because of the change of actresses. At least in the third and fourth installments both main leads are different, so one can picture them as a whole different version of Edvard and Paige.

So, watch The Prince and Me if you like the type of movie that it is described as; but unless you are quite patient and quite curious, avoid the sequels. Just imagine the way the story would have continued with the original cast and improved plot lines. I mean really, why write a sequel about a lost elephant? And can you really imagine Julia Stiles (Paige) acting the way that Kam Heskin (Paige 2) does in the sequels? No, not really. Can you picture Luke Mably (Edvard) acting the way that Chris Geere (Edvard 2) does in the sequels? No.

The story of a Crown Prince falling in love and becoming the King that he should be because of that love. And so there is a happy ending? If you're watching this movie you probably want to see a happy ending, right?",1310601600,,2105,4.378516624040921

2072055,3,B00029NLGY,"The acting was very good and the characters were all very likable and believable.  The movie takes its time telling the story in order to develop the characters in a good way (it was never boring in my opinion).  It is a five star movie until we get to the end and I will admit I am probably just getting too old and practical but the ending really left a foul taste in my mouth.  I expected fantasy, it is a fairy tale kind of story, but that is not the ending you get, we get the spreading of the myth that you can have it all.  Spoiler alert in case you want to see it:  I am sick of the false belief that you can have it all.  No, you really can't.  Life is about choices and you have to make them; when you do you have to give up something to get your goal.  If a nanny is raising you kids while you work 80 hours a week and go out on the weekends you don't have it all-you have your work and social life and on the side you spawned children to be raised by someone else.  If you stay at home to raise your children then great, you are a houseparent but you are giving up your career (at least for 18 yeas or so).  If you want to go to medical school, go do that but you can't be a queen and a doctor, and a mom and a whatever.  Make your choices and live with them but to say the handsome prince is going to wait 7-12 years while she does medical school and residency and then her mission work adds another few years . . . just plain silly.  He is going to be bald and infertile by the time she shows up.  Sorry for the cynicism but I stay quiet when friends describe their life as having it all when they don't. for the movie I bought I can say my feelings.",1297728000,,1664,3.8588235294117648
2072056,2,B00029NLGY,"I just watched this because it was on a triple feature DVD I bought to get something else.  I did expect a chick flick and sat down prepared to enjoy it as such, but I finished it wondering if anyone but a 13-year old girl could sit through it without groaning ""puh-leeze"" or rolling their eyes every few minutes.  I sure couldn't.  I am shocked to come here and see it getting fairly high marks.  Except for a few amusing situations created by plopping a prince into ordinary surroundings along with his personal assistant (or whatever Zoren(?) was supposed to be)--since they couldn't stop being what they were--I could hardly believe this film got made.  It was trite and predictable from beginning to end...and most of the actors never stopped looking like they were acting--especially Julia.  I thought filmmakers really went out of their way to try to avoid these sorts of things!  Certainly they've upset me enough times by messing up a story just to NOT be predictable.  Well, I guess there's no accounting for tastes...and it certainly is a fairy tale, if that's all you're looking for.

The silliest part, I think, was when Julia realized she loved what's-his-name after he was suddenly called back home (I can't remember either of the characters' names, although I just saw this yesterday), so she quickly packed a bag (in about two minutes while talking to her friend) and ran down to the airport to buy a ticket to Denmark, with all her girlfriends pitching in to help her.  No telling what THAT cost, since she next jumped right onto the plane, apparently with no messing about for a passport, phone calls to relatives, checking with her boss, etc.  When she arrived a few minutes later, fresh as a daisy (it IS an overseas flight, isn't it??), she only had a shoulder bag, but she soon left that behind, too, and got to the palace with only the clothes she was wearing.  I sure wish international travel were that easy for ME!  And that I could wake up the next morning looking like she did!  Oh, but this is a fairy tale--silly me for expecting SOME attention to reality.  I didn't notice the weather problem someone else mentioned--but yes, duh, if this mostly took place in November, they sure messed that up!",1294617600,,2227,4.659846547314578

I do wish that they had used the original cast in the sequels: Julia Stiles (whom I've always loved as an actress), Luke Mably (more believable as a prince to become king), Ben Miller (always a pleasure to watch) They had a chemistry together and were more believable.

2072060,4,B00029NLGY,"This film is an ideal 'get away from it all' movie. Unfortunately the scriptwriters chose an actual country for this film and didn't research it properly. At that time the real romance was occurring.
The Crown Prince of Denmark is actually Frederick not Edouard. His girlfriend's name at the time was Mary Donaldson who was born in Tasmania, Australia. They met at the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney and kept in contact by email for many months before Mary moved to Europe to be closer to Frederick. They became engaged in late 2002.
If the scriptwriters had chosen any other country than Denmark, or preferably created one, this wouldn't be an issue. However, if one knows the real story it lowers the crediblity and enjoyment of this movie.
If you don't know the facts of the Danish royal family this film is thoroughly enjoyable. If like me you do, you feel constant frustration. Even literary licence isn't enough to enable me to completely feel great about it.",1257724800,,963,4.772455089820359

2072068,5,B00029NLGY,"From the title of this film, I expected a typical fluffy Cinderella fairytale for kids but was pleasantly surprised, especially by the terrific chemistry between the leads of Paige and Prince Eddie, played capably by Julia Stiles and Luke Mably.  It's not a kids' flick, but much more appealing to teenagers and adults and the characters are surprisingly three-dimensional and act like real college students and adults.

Luke Mably is a gem as the handsome, indolent, sophisticated (though completely naive about American ways) European playboy Prince Edvard, undercover as Danish exchange student ""Eddie Williams"" at the University of Wisconsin to escape the pressures of royal life.  He comes to America looking for a good time with easy American girls after being splashed all over the tabloids for his exploits with fast cars and women in his native land and reprimanded by his strict parents, the king and queen of Denmark.  The last thing Eddie expects is to fall in love with the one woman apparently resistant to his charms, the hyperfocused, hardworking premed student Paige Morgan, a farm girl completely baffled by why all her hometown girlfriends would give up a chance to go out into the world in favor of marriage and settling down.

The movie is definitely carried by the fantastic chemistry between the two leads, who are believably both sweet and passionate towards one another.  The acting is subtle and there is plenty of comedy based on the ""fish out of water"" scenario, especially coming from the Prince's manservant Soren, as he dryly and snobbishly observes the American lifestyle before succumbing to Xbox addiction over Thanksgiving break. The gradual romantic buildup during the college part of the film is remarkably believable and sweet.

The second half of the film was rushed compared to the first, but I guess that was the fairytale part.  They've only just started dating after a few months of flirting and friendship, and suddenly he proposes and she accepts?  Seemed very fast to me, but Eddie and Paige are extremely adorable in their lovey-dovey scenes in Denmark that I'll overlook it.  The ending seemed a bit awkward (and the director reveals that they didn't quite know what to do--just that they wanted Paige to become a doctor and Eddie to come back for her), and it would have been more believable to not have him show up to surprise her but instead have the audience be surprised that they decided to continue a long-distance relationship when it appeared as if they broke up, but that's JMHO.

There are a couple of nitpicks, one being the timeline of the movie, which appears to happen over one semester ending in the winter, except that it's sunny and green in both Wisconsin and Denmark in late November and December instead of cold and dark.  And the people of Denmark allowing Paige to slip away unnoticed during Eddie's coronation even though they noticed her in the crowd when she came to look for him from the paparazzi photos at the U of W is strange too, since she's had many photo ops with Edvard since arriving and would be even more recognizable.

As for the DVD extras, they are pretty cool.  The commentary with the director was insightful, and there are nice (though short) interviews with the cast in which Luke Mably and Ben Miller reveal that they went out in character as prince and valet to convince real life people that Luke was the prince of Denmark just to see their reactions.  The deleted/extended/alternate scenes are nice too, especially the scenes of Eddie and Paige post break up where you see Eddie studying hard and dealing with everyone knowing he's the prince and watching Paige get accepted to medical school from afar, which are quite melancholy, and the additional scenes of Eddie and Paige in Denmark being cozy and adorable together with some funny cut lines from Paige now that she is the fish out of water trying to adapt to royal life.  There are also featurettes on the lawnmower race and researching the architecture/fashion of European royalty for those who are interested, a gag reel and the movie's trailer.  Overall it's a very cute, enjoyable romantic movie with solid DVD extras.",1213920000,,4175,4.890934844192635

Being a Crown Prince is really not a very good job which this film shows.  You are surrounded by sycophants and can never determine who are real friends and who are not.  Thus the Prince goes incognito to Wisconsin and the fun begins.  Be sure and watch his Valet because he has some of the best lines in the movie.  The Prince is totally helpless in most situations but not all.  More importantly he is willing to learn and just be a regular guy.  His driven and soon to be girl friend is also relatively realistic in her disdain for the pampered Prince.  Once his cover is blown the action shifts back to Denmark and the royal family.  I felt the Queen came across like most of the Danes I have met -- a little stiff at first but warm, friendly, and essentially pro-American.  This is a typical fairy tale not very realistic but fun and it leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy at the end.  Very predictable but then what fairy tale isn't?  I only gave it 4 stars because I couldn't justify giving 5 to a piece of fluff but this is a fun movie and your wife or girl friend will definitely like it.",1185235200,,1202,4.242290748898679
2072075,3,B00029NLGY,"His Royal Highness Edvard of Denmark is next in line for the throne, but is still living like a very rich, spoiled playboy. In his latest scheme to ""blow off some steam"", he decides to head off to America (after seeing the word ""Wisconsin"" plastered across a girls boob while watching a raunchy ""Girls Gone Wild-type"" television commercial) in search of some ""fun"".  The kicker is that his trip turns into something infinitely different than what he expected.

While posing as a Danish exchange student on the University of Wisconsin campus, he meets senior Paige, a hardworking farm girl who aspires to go to John Hopkins Medical School.. Their relationship starts out rocky, to say the least, with Paige thinking ""Eddie"" is a spoiled rich boy, and ""Eddie"" trying to do whatever it takes to woo Paige's heart. When the Prince runs out of money, he is forced to find a job and do menial tasks. Paige is failing her Shakespeare class, one that she desperately needs to ace if she is going to graduate, and when she finds out that Eddie is versed in Shakespeare they strike a bargain...she will teache him how to do laundry, if he will help her understand the Sonnets..thus the romance begins. I don't want to disclose anymore of the plot here; I'm sure you can figure out that hey fall in love, but the endingis quite a surprise, very unusual - totally not expected.

I want to issue a word of caution for parents - please don't mistake this for a cute teen-type Disney movie. I watched this with my very mature 11-year old and I'm sorry I didn't watch it alone first. In one of the earlier scenes Paige and her friends are shown drinking beer and doing shots (she does one shot).  Hen there's the Girls Gone Wild-type television commercial that went on way too long, and the kissing...There is a LOT of serious kissing in this movie and one scene where the two main characters go at it in the library (the Prince loses his shirt, literally). My point is, according to the standards of our household, I would say this is mature movie. I was not comfortable with the intimacy displayed and the overdone portrayal of the typical ""college"" behavior, but this would not deter me form saying that as a whole. I really liked it. Seeing the Prince mature into a delightful young man because of his relationship with Paige was worth it, as was the fabulous acting by Julia Stiles and Luke Mably.

As it was, the young couple was outside in the grass having a picnic on a pleasant looking summer?? day, with Paige in a cool looking summer dress!

I would do it this way:  Place Paige in her jr. year beginning her 2nd semester as Eddy comes on the scene.  The holiday visit home would be at Easter or spring break, and the trip to Denmark would be summertime.  Because Paige would still have a year left of school to complete for her bachelor's degree, one could understand why she would get cold feet in the end, and wish to return and complete the first portion of her studies towards a medical degree.  In the meantime, Prince Edvard becomes king and has a very busy year, but can't seem to get the memory of Paige out of his mind. So, he returns to Wisconsin just in time to greet Paige directly following her graduation.

2072084,3,B00029NLGY,"With its excellent cast and Cinderella storyline, this is a fairly formulaic, predictable film about a very focused young woman, Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles), a farmer's daughter from Wisconsin who wants to become a doctor. She is so focused that she simply does not date, that is, until she is a pre-med student at the University of Wisconsin and meets ""Eddie"" (Luke Mably), a fellow student at the University. Despite an inauspicious first meeting, she and ""Eddie"" become lab partners, work in the same student hang-out joint, and eventually fall in love. Little does she know that ""Eddie"" is really Edvard, the Crown Prince of Denmark.

It seems that Edvard, nothing more than a rich, spoiled royal playboy, originally set out to attend the University of Wisconsin incognito, accompanied by his valet, Soren (Ben Miller), in hopes of sowing some wild oats and scoring with the chicks. When he meets Julia, his hopes of an easy, breezy fling are dashed, when he discovers that his charms are initially lost upon her. They eventually become friends, as they each have something that they can teach the other, but end up falling in love. Just as they are on the bring of consummating their love, the paparazzi descend upon them, and all hell breaks loose.

Paige is, of course, understandably miffed that ""Eddie"" has not told her the truth. Edvard, however, makes Paige an honorable proposal of marriage. Needless to say, the royal family is initially less than thrilled with the Crown Prince's choice of a mate. While King Haraald (James Fox) feels that it is his son's choice, Queen Rosalind (Miranda Richardson) is not a happy camper at the prospect of an American commoner for a daughter-in-law. Of course, Paige doesn't help any, as on the surface she comes across as a stolid, unsophisticated, and uncultured, though otherwise nice, young woman. Still, it seems that Edvard has done a three hundred and sixty degree turn and become a serious and stable young man since his attachment to Paige developed. Then, Paige has second thoughts about becoming the next Queen of Denmark, throwing a small monkey wrench into the works.

James Fox and Miranda Richardson steal the movie out from under Julia Stiles' nose, however brief their appearance. Moreover, there is simply little chemistry between Ms. Stiles and her leading man, Luke Mably. While I think that Ms. Stiles is one of the better young actresses around, this film is simply not one of her finer performances, as her portrayal of Paige is often leaden. It could simply be that she was hampered by the quality of the script. As for Luke Mably, he had his moments, but they were not enough to make this film more than what it is. This is simply a pleasant, romantic piece of fluff that is worth a rental and not much more.",1150588800,,2782,4.828092243186583
2072085,2,B00029NLGY,"For a country that prides itself on having severed its monarchical roots over two hundred years ago, it's amazing how many American movies designed to titillate the fancies of teenaged girls still endorse the antiquated notion that finding one's very own Prince Charming is the key element on the road to happiness.

In the lame romantic comedy ""The Prince and Me,"" Julia Stiles plays a premed undergrad in the Midwest who falls for a handsome ""foreign exchange student"" who just happens to be the Prince of Denmark in disguise.  He's a royal slacker who has come to the University of Wisconsin in the naively boorish belief that coeds in the States will be willing to lift up their shirts for him the moment he asks them to do so.  And all I can say is if you can swallow that premise, then you can pretty much swallow everything else that comes along in the wake of it.

Not pretty in a conventional sense, the gifted Stiles has a full-moon face and a wincey expression that gives her an air of intelligence that seems sorely out of place in the mind-numbingly preposterous scenario she`s been called upon to enact here.  Luke Mably is bland and flavorless as her knight in shining armor, and the whole production is so sloppy in its details that, even though it is supposed to be Thanksgiving in Wisconsin, everyone is running around in shirtsleeves and shorts among the trees that seem to have forgotten to turn colors and shed their leaves for the season.  You can blame it on global warming, I suppose - but I suspect the true culprit lies in incompetent moviemaking.",1142640000,3,1573,4.640287769784172
2072086,5,B00029NLGY,"First, a little background of myself - I'm an U.S. Air Force officer, with background in both physical sciences & project management.  I tend to steer towards movies that either make me think, or invoke emotional responses (interpret at will).  I also gravitate toward movies that have fantastic soundtracks.

I first sought this movie out because my wife enjoys cute love movies, and because Julia Stiles plays roles in love stories quite well.  The premise itself is a cute one - two people who are made for each other question their lifelong chosen destinies.  It touches topics such as class (rich vs. poor), values (working for every penny vs. being spoiled), destiny (pre-destined vs. taking the bull by the horns), to name a few.

I shed tears as I watched this movie with my wife.  Not because it's depressing, but because the movie strongly reminded me how lucky I am to be married to my wife, and how a combination of perfect timing, maturity, and perspective got me to recognize true love at the right time in my life.  In essence, the movie reminded me how my wife (just a friend @ point of enlightenment) saved me from pursuing an insular, safe life.

Ok enough about my runin with Kleenex -

You can easily watch this with teenagers (most boys won't sit still for this movie).  It reinforces the notion that true love can be had for those who are willing to accept it.  In short, it's a cheery movie you'd want to have out for viewing, when you have friends/family over for the weekend.

Miranda Richardson and James Fox play the role of queen & king quite nicely.  They create a good level of tension with the prince, displaying tension that just begs to be resolved before the movie ends.  Eliza Bennett hams up the role of the younger sibling princess quite nicely - especially playing a Gameboy while dressed elegantly.

Alberta Watson, as Julia Stiles' character mother, reminds the audience that parents can be a great source of wisdom.  The rest of the supporting cast play roles of people you'd probably find in normal life - college dorm settings mostly.

The movie does a great job of showing how the two main characters grow and change for the better.  Rather than seeing one person become a different person within one frame, you can easily see the progression over the entire stretch of the movie.

The movie's soundtrack is fantastic.  It's a good synthesis of new and vintage materiel - I learned who Tom Waits was due to listening to the music.  Plus, I discovered another fantastic contemporary composer, Jennie Muskett.

I gave this movie 5 stars, because it reminded me how lucky I am to be married to my wife (made me think), got me to shed tears (the emotional response), and because I discovered Tom Waits and Jennie Muskett along the way (the soundtrack thing).  Plus, I ended up buying it too, because I don't tire of watching it with my wife.",1140220800,104,2881,4.659405940594059

Enter Prince Edward of Denmark who is taking a breather from his royal duties to attend Paige's university incognito as Eddie Williams. This role is played magnificently by British actor Luke Mably. He looks, sounds and acts very much like a royal and has the most endearing demeanor thoughout the film.

2072089,3,B00029NLGY,"Roger Ebert actually gave ""The Prince and Me"" zero stars which seems a little harsh, as it does have a few universally enjoyable scenes and decent performances from almost the entire cast. Unfortunately they are saddled with a somewhat weak and completely predictable screenplay, and a premise that has been used and reused.

Ebert compares it unfavorably with ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" where the same type of small town girl wins a date with a big Hollywood star, who then falls in love with her freshness and sincerity.  She begins to struggle with the tedious real-life demands of what she thought would be a glamorous life. Others compare it to 1954's ""The Student Prince"" and its 1997 television remake, although not unfavorably as both productions are considered barely competent. I think it is most like ""Coming to America"", although it does not capture the humor and social commentary of that film. I'm sure that the producers of ""The Prince and Me"" drew considerable inspiration from the box office popularity of ""Coming to America. Unfortunately they failed to follow its example and create a fictional monarchy, choosing instead to subject Denmark to the indignity of this silly story.

The story obviously satisfies some basic yearning in the human psyche, or at least the teenage female psyche. The most interesting thing about ""The Prince and Me"" is the inspired way they successfully expanded their target audience to include pre-teen girls. By casting Eliza Bennett (with apologies to Jane Austen) as the Princes's adoring little sister, Princess Arabella, they created a nice fantasy for this younger demographic. To her credit, Eliza brings a lot of much needed charm to the production.

The physical casting of the two leads is very good. Julia Stiles does not exude a lot of sensuality but fits the role of a brainy American college student, with ambitions to become a doctor. That Stiles is convincing as a smart and serious young woman helps convince us when Queen (Miranda Richardson) is eventually won over by her prospective daughter-in- law. Their changing relationship is the one plot element that you don't entirely see coming. And Luke Mably fits Americas idea of a young prince, looking much like those Windsor boys.

While the pairings of Prince and little sister and of Queen and future Queen work exceptionally well, the Stiles-Mably relationship has no chemistry and seems terribly forced. So one just has to go with it and enjoy the other elements of the film.

Once the story moves to Copenhagen it gets better as they do a good job of presenting the entire experience from the point of view of Paige Morgan (Stiles). With this it actually improves on ""Coming to America"" and becomes much more like ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"".

This is one of those films where you can see every single plot development from a million miles away. Although that will make very little difference to it's target audience, others will find it makes much of the film a yawn-fest.

There is growth in the prince's character, but it's not done in a believeable manner.  The prince is a disinterested punk who spends state meetings drawing cars on his agenda, yet after one semester in Wisconsin, he is able to negotiate settlements to stop strikes.  Perhaps I took the movie too seriously, but if I were from Denmark, I would find this depiction of my country and people insulting.  I'm not certain that the people of Wisconsin could have been too thrilled either.  All in all, even for what it's supposed to be (a fairy tale story aimed at 13 year old girls), the story is simply too cliche, which is disappointing considering it has some wonderful people in the cast.  I'm usually able to suspend my belief when watching movies like this and enjoy them, but this one just doesn't make it.  Two stars for the casting choices, but I wouldn't reccomend purchasing this movie.  It's more of a rental.... with a coupon.",1117929600,7,1305,4.542735042735043
2072105,3,B00029NLGY,"Paige and Edvard are total opposites.  She's a pre-med student at the University of Wisconsin; he's a spoiled Prince, next in line to be King of Denmark. They meet when Edvard, thinking all American girls are like the ones in the Girls Gone Wild videos, enrolls at the University, hoping to meet some of the girls. After a rough start, the two fall in love. When Paige finds out that ""Eddie"" is really a member of royalty, she has to decide whether to follow her dream to become a doctor or to give it all up to become Queen of Denmark.

This is a nice romantic comedy. Julia Stiles and Luke Mabley have nice chemistry and it's fun watching their characters interact. Ben Miller almost steals the movie as Soren, Edvard's bodyguard. There are many scenes of Edvard's home life and Paige's home life, to show the differences between the two lifestyles. There are times when the movie seems to be going in a more serious direction and exploring how much Paige would be giving up and what it really means to be a member of royalty, but unfortunately it just skirts the issue. I wish, in fact, that this movie had ended on a more open note and that a sequel had been made that concentrated more on Paige's adjustment to royal life. It would have been a much stronger movie that way, but it's still a good, fun movie to watch.",1117670400,,1321,4.432098765432099

The actors are excellent, the script writing creates believable characters, and the prince's growth from superficial pervert to thoughtful human being is engaging. I do, however, have a bone to pick. Does no one watch old movies? People keep referring to this story as ""Cinderella."" Why does every rags to riches story (even the ones involving a prince) have to be ""Cinderella""? In truth, every bone the body of this story stands on has been taken exactly from the old musical, ""The Student Prince."" I thought that for the movie makers to make no mention of the old story, or its original writers is a shame. The writers, in essence, have plagiarized--stolen someone's story, and the credit due them--by not giving the original writers, and their story, some sort of mention in the credits. I don't care if the copyrite is out of date on the old version. Giving credit is polite, and it is honest.",1115942400,2,994,4.718390804597701
2072107,4,B00029NLGY,"This movie is a particular favorite of mine. Equal part comedy, romance and drama the movie features some wonderful performances (especially from the supporting cast) and enough light-hearted air to stop the drama from being too overbearing.

The movie centers around the romance between a Danish prince and a medical student at the University of Wisconsin.

Seems the Danish prince (Edward) is a little restless and (in an apparent reference to the antics of Britain's Princes William and Harry) is feeling the pressure of the expectations lofted upon him and engaging in car races and dalliances with a number of girls.

Following a particularly embarrassing incident and in the belief that American girls are wild and exhibitionist, Edward persuades his parents to allow him to attend classes in Wisconsin. His intentions are however hardly noble. In fact his persistence in visiting America's Dairyland comes from a television commercial for one of those Girls Gone Wild-type videos that gives Edward the impression that Wisconsin girls are easy - boy is he in for a shock.

It's not long after arriving at Wisconsin that he realizes that the campus is not populated entirely by free-wheeling party girls and in fact the one girl who catches his eye in particular is a very studious medical student (played with warmth and charm by Julia Stiles).

There is a real wicked streak of comedy in here, mostly supplied by the supporting characters such as Edward's bemused and disdainful man servant or his sloth-some roommate. But, what this movie does best is romantic comedy.

Of particular joy is watching Edward grow into the responsibilities of being a future King as his father (played by the amazing James Fox) slips further into decline.

For those who enjoyed movies such as ""Boys and Girls"" or ""Down to You"" (which also featured Stiles) then this is a movie you will enjoy. It's warm, charming and uplifting.",1114387200,21,1917,5.028391167192429
2072108,5,B00029NLGY,"This film is a delicious way to prove that the languages of fairy tale and literary classics are universal and greatly effective in our modern world. Characters such as Charming Prince and Dutiful Farm Maid (duly accompanied by king, queen, and a totally hilarious servant who greatly resembles the role of Pussy in Boots), fairy tale situations such as quests, tests and infatuations, mix in this story to present a situation in which a highly focused, ambitious, hard-working girl of our times (Paige)faces a tough choice indeed: either to follow her ideals and the path she's been laboriously creating through very hard work (which involves studying at medical school and then working for Doctors without Borders), or follow her heart and run after the dashingly handsome classmate she has fallen in love with (and who has turned out to be nothing less than the -for real- Prince of Denmark).

And so, enters literary language, giving us several hilarious literary hints and winks at the conclusion the story is leading us to. Actually, literature plays the role of the fairy godmother, helping and guiding Paige (who believes literature is a useless vestige of past times) in her decissions. The most important example of this is quite early in the story, in a moment of what should be routine laundry making for the main characters, but which ends up turned into a moment of romance through the magic of  Shakespeare (some fairy!!). When Edvar (the Prince of Denmark) passionately defends Hamlet (the Prince of Denmark), we begin to see this character is evolving from play-boy royal rake to royal grown-up. But when he explains metaphor to Paige through one of Shakespeare's love sonnets, we literally see the sparks of love. Some really wonderful acting and directing in this scene, too.

When Edvar explains the imagery of this sonnet, we are given the main theme of the film -even the sun (reason) cannot shine through the clouds of Heaven (love)-. And the fact that Paige  understands this message of the sonnet (that love makes us blind) does not necessarily mean she thinks this can be applied to her own life. In fact, it is also Shakespeare who convinces her, through discussing Othello in a final literature exam, that she must grab the opportunity and run after her love.

And once in Denmark everything seems out of a fairy tale, but....let's just say that the film ends as it should: with the sun shining brightly (see Shakespeare).

""Thus you, pretty girls, out there

Listen carefully and beware,

When Prince charming comes around

Just be sure to stand your ground;

For she deserves not True Love's gifts

Who from her very Essence drifts""",1111104000,6,2662,4.919642857142857
2072109,3,B00029NLGY,"Disclaimer: I am not this film's target audience.  This is a film that was made for 15-30 year old women, and I'm a man of the same age bracket.

There are three kinds of chick flicks out there.  There are the kind that men don't mind watching and may secretly kind of like (see Sleepless in Seattle), the kind that men could do without but will tolerate (see Ghost) and the kind that guys hate (see How to Make an American Quilt).  This film falls into the middle category.

The Prince and Me has what seems to me to be your basic chick flick plot - girl is independent, meets arrogant guy, girl changes guy, guy changes girl, they fall in love.  The twist here, of course, is that the guy happens to be royalty so there's a fairy tale quality about the end of the film.  The plot is not the major problem here, as it does have a couple of interesting twists.

The problem is the execution of the first 30 minutes of the film, which are disjointed and uninteresting.  There is a substantial amount of time spent setting up Paige (Julia Stiles)as independent and driven, and some of the scenes dealing with this topic are forced and repetitive.  The same is true for the Prince (Luke Mably), though his scenes are considerably more interesting due to comic relief provided by Soren (Ben Miller), the prince's man servant.  Overall, the beginning of the film is poorly acted, directed, and written, and frankly was not interesting enough to hold my attention.

This is a shame, because after the Prince and Paige fall in love the film picks up, the writing is crisper, and the direction seems to be better.  The subplot with Soren becoming addicted to XBox is absolutely hysterical even though it only consumes a few seconds of screen time.  Once the scene shifts to Denmark the film becomes much more engaging, though the last five minutes, with a cop-out to please the mass market, are disappointing.

The DVD has a couple of special features worth watching.  The commentary from director Martha Coolidge (who directed one of my favorite films, Real Genius) is above average and has a nice mix of technical film insider stuff about camera angles and insightful commentary into some of the characters.  There is a featurette about the lawnmower racing sequence (really, the guy's highlight to the film) that is definately worth watching.  The gag reel is average, as are the other featurettes, though it does provide the alternate (read original) ending.

Overall, this film gets 0 stars for the first 30 minutes, three stars thereafter, and 4 for the DVD features.  Guys won't like the film unless they're on a date, but they'll at least be able to tolerate it if they can get past the first 30 minutes.",1108857600,26,2704,4.640756302521009

THE PRINCE AND ME  ***

With its excellent cast and Cinderella storyline, this is a fairly formulaic, predictable film about a very focused young woman, Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles), a farmer's daughter from Wisconsin who wants to become a doctor. She is so focused that she simply does not date, that is, until she is a pre-med student at the University of Wisconsin and meets ""Eddie"" (Luke Mably), a fellow student at the University. Despite an inauspicious first meeting, she and ""Eddie"" become lab partners, work in the same student hang-out joint, and eventually fall in love. Little does she know that ""Eddie"" is really Edvard, the Crown Prince of Denmark.

It seems that Edvard, nothing more than a rich, spoiled royal playboy, originally set out to attend the University of Wisconsin incognito, accompanied by his valet, Soren (Ben Miller), in hopes of sowing some wild oats and scoring with the chicks. When he meets Julia, his hopes of an easy, breezy fling are dashed, when he discovers that his charms are initially lost upon her. They eventually become friends, as they each have something that they can teach the other, but end up falling in love. Just as they are on the bring of consummating their love, the paparazzi descend upon them, and all hell breaks loose.

Paige is, of course, understandably miffed that ""Eddie"" has not told her the truth. Edvard, however, makes Paige an honorable proposal of marriage. Needless to say, the royal family is initially less than thrilled with the Crown Prince's choice of a mate. While King Haraald (James Fox) feels that it is his son's choice, Queen Rosalind (Miranda Richardson) is not a happy camper at the prospect of an American commoner for a daughter-in-law. Of course, Paige doesn't help any, as on the surface she comes across as a stolid, unsophisticated, and uncultured, though otherwise nice, young woman. Still, it seems that Edvard has done a three hundred and sixty degree turn and become a serious and stable young man since his attachment to Paige developed. Then, Paige has second thoughts about becoming the next Queen of Denmark, throwing a small monkey wrench into the works.

James Fox and Miranda Richardson steal the movie out from under Julia Stiles' nose, however brief their appearance. Moreover, there is simply little chemistry between Ms. Stiles and her leading man, Luke Mably. While I think that Ms. Stiles is one of the better young actresses around, this film is simply not one of her finer performances, as her portrayal of Paige is often leaden. It could simply be that she was hampered by the quality of the script. As for Luke Mably, he had his moments, but they were not enough to make this film more than what it is. This is simply a pleasant, romantic piece of fluff that is worth a rental and not much more.

SAVE THE LAST DANCE  ****

This is a well acted, somewhat sanitized and idealized story of a talented teenage girl who, on the cusp of achieving her dream, loses everything, only to find it again in a way no one would have predicted. It is a story about attaining one's dreams and the process by which they may become a reality. This is a well acted, though predictable, coming of age tale which can be enjoyed by young and old alike.

Here, the talented Julia Stiles plays the role of Sara, a teenager who happens to be a talented ballet dancer. Auditioning for the famous Julliard School while angry at her single parent mother for being late to her audition, she fumbles her audition. She finishes, only to discover that her mother, in her haste to make Sara's audition, died in a tragic car accident on her way. Blaming herself for her mother's death, Sara gives up ballet.

Her pleasant life suddenly snatched from her, Sara is forced to go live with her estranged dad, Roy, wonderfully acted by Terry Tinney. A down and out jazz musician who lives on Chicago's tough south side, Roy does the best he can to make up for lost time. Sara, seemingly undaunted by her seamy new surroundings, enters a predominantly black, inner city high school, where she is befriended by fellow student, Chanelle, a single mom with a hunky, intelligent brother, Derek, played by Sean Patrick Thomas, who is well cast in the role. Bound for Georgetown University, Derek hopes to one day become a doctor.

Through her blossoming relationship with Derek, Sara begins to dance again. It is through his encouragement and nurturing that she regains the confidence to follow her dream and audition once again for Julliard. It is also through his commitment to Sara that Derek finds the courage to tell his gangsta wanna be friend that he wants no further involvement in his friend's nefarious activities, before it is too late for him.

Sara's audition is a show stopping dance routine that is the icing on this enjoyable, coming of age film. It is a testament to hope and to the power of love.",1108252800,5,5200,4.879818594104308

There, from Denmark, comes Prince Edvard (played by British Luke Mably) as 'Eddie' seeking for lots of fun and chicks here in Wisconsin, just because he saw these cute American girls on TV.  What happens in the 1h50m film is nothing surprisng, except that the real Prince of Denmark, Crown Prince Frederick married a commoner Mary Donaldson of Australia the same year this film was released.

The film is a typical fairy tale like 'The Princess Diaries,' but considering that fact above mentioned, it should have more topicality and credibility in it.  Adults watching it, however, will find the film's story nothing new, keeping itself in the quite safe territory.  The story is made out of strict formulas -- including comic relief Ben Miller appearing as Eddie's valet -- and the love story between Paige and Eddie develops exactly as you expect.  They hate each other at first, then come to realize that the girl/boy is not as bad as he/she had been thinking.

Still, the actors are so amiable that they almost get away with the cliched script and Martha Coolige's by-the-numbers play-it-safe direction.  In fact, 'The Prince and Me' proves unwittingly that Julia Stiles is such a fine, talented actress who needs and deserves much better films, romantic comedy or not.  Her natural charms exude so easily in the too familiar situations that she can give credibility even to the most contrived spript.

Veterans also appear.  Miranda Richardson and James Fox as The Queen and The King of Denmark, and they are as great as you can imagine.  If only the film decided to include their turns more, and shows something interactive between them and Julia Stiles.  As it is, their roles are obligatory at best, though still they render the film's images of royal family more credible ... just briefly though.

Escapism, Cinderella story, whatever you say, 'The Prince and Me' has some funny scenes and plausible moments concerning the royal family in it.  And after all, the leads are so likable that it is hard to hate this film.  Still, it could be better, I think, with shorter running time and tight direction.

2072117,2,B00029NLGY,"Despite the efforts to describe this story as a great story that has not been done before, the reality is far different from that suggested by the producers of the film. This is little more than yet another variation on the Cinderella story that Hollywood has been milking for one hundred years. Some of those milkings have been somewhat more successful than the others, but overall it is a theme that we have all become rather too familiar with over the years in film. It also does not help that it has been paraded in some form or another in real life over recent decades too. So what exactly does The Prince & Me offer that makes it stand out in a crowd?

Basically not a whole lot. My attraction to the film was simply due to the casting of Julia Stiles in the lead role - of the emerging crop of new female actors, she is in my view one of the better ones and she rarely offers up a poor performance. The trouble is that whilst she might not offer up poor performances, sometimes her co-workers are not so discriminating and at times let her down. This is perhaps one of those times. As for other attractions the film might have? Not too many.

Yet despite all the less than positive vibes here, what results is a decent enough romantic comedy that is by no means an atrocious way to spend two hours of your life. There are certainly a lot better choices out there, but equally there are loads of even worse choices.

2072118,4,B00029NLGY,"I think the biggest problem I have with this movie is seeing how inaccurately the Danish Royal family is portrayed. I admit that I am interested in the current European royal families and so this makes me expect a lot from films. The real Royal family of Denmark is rather interesting in and of itself. The typical mother rules the home role that the Queen played was a bit much. Currently the Queen is the ruler of Denmark with her husband being a prince, this would have messed up the plot for the film, but it could have been worked around. Also in Denmark, the king (or queen) cannot just step down, he has to actually pass away before the next person can be crowned. However, in the Netherlands the reigning monarch can step down and there is a tradition for this happening with the past three monarchs.

  The parts that I found to be most accurate where basic daily life. They did show what royals today do, they do openings of buildings, visit hospitals, etc., They sit in council meetings and attend dinners.

While I disliked the end because it wasn't a typical fairy tale ending, I also disliked it for Paige's illogical view of her future. As a princess or a queen she would have been able to bring much more attention to the Doctor's Without Borders program that she as a doctor could ever do on her own. Think of the late Princess Diana who probably added millions of dollars to the bank accounts of charities that she was involved in simply be being a patron. Princesses and Queens can also finish college; the current Queen of Belgium finished a degree while on the throne.

Also for some problems others mentioned, the Danish do in fact know English, most people do, especially people who interact internationally on a regular basis. In fact the majority of members of royal families are multi-lingual as a result of education, upbringing around different languages and studying abroad.

2072119,5,B00029NLGY,"There are many well-written reviews on this movie, so I will only add a few more points.

I felt the acting by Luke Mably was superb.  He could move easly from carefree playboy to soul-touched romeo and be believable as both.  His every emotion was revealed in his eyes and face, except in those instances where he was supposed to be hiding his emotions.  I really admired his performance.  You could truly believe that he went from playboy to devoted prince charming through the course of the movie.

Julia Stiles, well, what can I say?  Really, her most perfect performance yet (although rivaled by her performance in Mona Lisa.)  I really believed she was a hard-working dairy farm girl and a brilliant scientist working hard to become a doctor.  How many actors could pull off that dual-personality?

Not to be missed, her solo dancing scene.  It was truly beautiful.  The song was perfect, and her imperfect yet unself-conscious movement really sealed the deal with her prince charming.

The role of Soren was diverse and funny, yet a bit mean.  In the end, I didn't really like him.

The only really plot problem came when Paige (Julia Stiles) had to tell Eddie (Luke Mably) about her desire not to give up her dreams.  Her good-bye was abrupt with very little segue.

Although we knew she had worthwhile dreams of becoming a doctor, there just wasn't enough warning this scene was coming.  I felt a bit betrayed by the script as I believed very much in her dedicated love to the prince at this point.  Had there been a scene or two where she seemed to miss her former dreams, I would have been a little less suprised when this scene came about.

Here good-bye seemed a bit heartless as she did not even open up a dialog to discuss it with Eddie.  As I said, the good-bye was really abrupt and out-of-character with the degree of their love.  (I guess I hoped for the impossible, as many movie-watchers would, that she could find a way of pursuing her dreams while fulfilling her role as a queen too.)

Though the ending was ambiguous, it gave us hope that they might one day forge a way to be together -- and ""live happily everafter, the end.""",1100736000,5,2150,4.556135770234987

Our heroine, a farm-girl pre-med student, is played by Julia Stiles, and Ms. Stiles continues a budding acting career where she plays women of depth and character.  Her Paige Morgan is accepted to Johns Hopkins Medical School around the same time she discovers Eddie is a Prince, and she aspires to work as a Doctor in an underserved country.

Prince Edvard GOES to Wisconsin because he's one of those Euro-trashy princes in the beginning of the movie and he sees an ad for one of those videos where college girls pull their shirts up, and *these* girls happen to be from Wisconsin.  Bent on meeting sleazy young girls at the U of W Edvard immediately becomes fixated on the least sleazy, most-principaled woman in sight.

When the scene comes where Paige discovers Eddie is the Crown Prince she doesn't think ""hey.... the hunky guy I was just kissing in the library is actually a PRINCE!"" Instead she shrieks at him ""you lied to me!"" (which is only true for those who consider that a lie can include what you don't say - Eddie only tells Paige that he has to ""go into the family business"" when he returns to Denmark.)

The King is ill at this exact moment and Edvard must jet back to Copenhagen, which leads to one of the better done Romantic Comedy cliche-moments, the one where one character flies off after the lovers have had a tiff, only to have the other character come flying after them on the next plane.  (If you think I've given anything away here, you haven't seen many Romantic Comedies.)

The third act begins here as Paige arrives in Denmark, is reunited with Edvard, and begins to contemplate a possible life as Queen of Denmark.  During the breakfast where it first dawns on her that this is possible she suddenly looks uncertain.  ""Do you think the people will mind if I'm the Queen of Denmark and all I've seen is the airport?""

The Cinderella tale gets a thoroughly modern and believable upgrade, and it must have been difficult for Martha Coolidge and the screenwriters to generate the required romantic conflict for the characters who seem to have everything.  Paige is not only the girl getting to go to Johns Hopkins, but the Prince falls in love with her too?  There's conflict here?

Okay - it's not the best Romantic Comedy ever.  But it's not the worst either.",1099699200,8,2962,4.661538461538462
2072122,5,B00029NLGY,"This movie is absolutely good. Generally, this movie tells about a pre-med college girl, Paige Morgan(Julia Stiles) who has  serious planning for her future and really intend to go for it. She wishes to avoid all distractions in her study life. Then, she meets with an easy-lfe-going and spoiled Eddie(Luke Mably)which happens to be the young Crown Prince Evard of Denmark in a student exchange in her college. Evard is seeking a chance in his lifetime to get out from his ironclading royal life as a prince. At first, Paige hates Eddie very much and thinks that he's a troublemaker that will ruin her semester. Well, those two have nothing in common and are from a totally different calibre. The interesting thing is their feeling of love towards each other are born through literature(poem) which happen to be so miraculous. Then, dilemma breaks out between them when Paige finds out that Eddie is actually the crown prince of Denmark. The love between them is so strong that Paige can't forget thinking about Eddie and decided to go to Denmark to find him. Though at first she leaves him after realizing that she's not ready to be the Queen of Denmark, but Evard still wants to be with her and go to find Paige after she ends her medical course. Evard tells Paige that he's willing to wait to be with her in the end. It is so touching and I like it a lot. This movie is well-acted(great performence by Stiles and Mably) and it has very beautiful story line that consists of romance and hilarity. A love that has been lighted up through poem. It is so BEAUTIFUL! It is quite educational at some part of the story too(good lessons taught to Evard by Paige about life-we must be interdependent). Indeed a real life fantasy. No doubt!",1098489600,4,1733,4.626623376623376
2072123,3,B00029NLGY,"I'm a sucker for romance and the Cinderella story is one of my favorites - however, there are just so many ways this tale can be told before it gets really old. Director Martha Coolidge gets off to a good start, updating the fairy tale to the 21st century, with our prince from Denmark, not Hamlet(ish) at all, but a very decisive, spoiled and sexy Prince Edvard Valdemar Dangaard (Luke Mably). He really looks royal and is very hunky. Paige Morgan, (played by the lovely Julia Stiles), is the love interest and a premed student at the University of Wisconsin. She's a farm girl who is very focused on a career in medicine with, perhaps, a post-grad stint working with ""Doctors Without Borders."" Paige has a plan, and early marriage is not on her to-do list. Edvard, bored in Denmark, views a TV commercial, ""Wild Girls of the Midwest,"" and decides that a year at a Wisconsin university might be just the experience to help him mature and settle down. He plans to attend classes undercover, so to speak. He definitely does not want the royal treatment.

OK! Predictable, but still amusing and entertaining, the studious female meets Eddie, playboy prince incognito, and there are some delightful scenes before the film begins to move downhill. Let it suffice to say/write that once the setting moves from the US to Denmark there are few surprises. The romance loses its luster (for me, not them). The impediments to the romance are so predictable. There is no pizzazz, energy, flair. This is a stale tale, and even a terrific cast cannot improve it much.

I am surprised at my lukewarm response to ""The Prince And Me."" I love princess flicks. Julia Stiles is a favorite, and she doesn't disappoint here. The problem is what she is given to work with lacks freshness and originality. The screenwriting is merely average. I mean, were any cliches ommited from the script? Ms. Stiles does brighten the screen, as do many in the cast - Prince Eddy is a real winner, and so is Soren (Ben Miller), the prince's valet. But there is just no zing! Sorry, but I can't recommend this with more than an average rating.

2072124,3,B00029NLGY,"I watched this movie, on TV, expecting it to be all right but not great- aimed at young teen girls. It is that but it actually does the story pretty well anyway.

The plot is about an irresponsible, somewhat lazy, fictional Danish Crown Prince who decides to go to Wisconsin after seeing a commercial for a video of Wisconsin college girls going topless for some stupid video. At the university he meets a very serious minded girl who has no time for someone like him (he's using an assumed name and she doesn't know who he really is).

Things go badly for a while but gradually thaw as she needs help with her Shakespeare class (he's an expert at it)and it seems he needs her help in a lot of things. He ends up being invited to her home for Thanksgiving break and gets along really well with everyone, the romance really gets started then.

Back at school things go well until the paparazzi get some incriminating photos of the two of them. Paige is furious when she finds out that ""Eddie"" is actually Crown Prince Edvard of Denmark and ends the relationship. At semester's end he goes back home to his royal duties and Paige finds that she can't bear to be without him.

From here on the movie does get kind of rushed and somewhat weak as she instantly decides to rush off to Denmark (with one small piece of luggage)with the aid of her own and her friends combined credit cards paying for a ticket. Once in Denmark her cab is stopped by what turns out to be a Royal parade. Paige gets out and tries to get Eddie's attention but can't. The crowd recognizes her from all the tabloid pictures and starts chanting her name, Eddie hears and rides his horse over to pick her up. Things really blur along  but Paige seems to get along with most everyone except the Queen and even they are all right once the Queen sees what a positive influence Paige has been on Edvard. At almost the end of the movie Paige suddenly gets cold feet and breaks off the engagement, leaving Denmark as the now King Edvard III  makes a speech to his subjects. Some months later Paige has graduated and can now go on to medical school as she's always wanted. She turns at hearing some Shakespeare, Edvard is there, he tells her he'll wait for her, she accepts his proposal.

The Denmark on part of the movie was less than half of the story and far too rushed along but the happy ending was nice.

One thing I found interesting was when the queen took Paige into the royal vault to try on some jewelry for some event. I remember thinking that the ""Harry Winston"" necklace she tried on was probably worth the price of her father's farm, turns out in the credits that Harry Winston did supply the jewelry shown.",1096243200,5,2683,4.406060606060606
2072125,5,B00029NLGY,"""The Prince and Me"" is a delightful, modern fairy tale.  Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) is a Manitowac farm girl pursuing her dream of admission to Johns Hopkins Medical School when she runs into Eddie (Luke Mably), the girl seeking Crown Prince of Denmark, on the campus of the University of Wisconsin.  As they find each other, the each find something within themselves that they had never before known.

Improbable, yes, impossible, well maybe not quite.  Like any successful humor, this film has just enough reality to make it funny.  We watch Edward mature and Paige confront a choice between two vastly different worlds.  At the end we are left guessing.  This is a delightful film for all!",1095984000,6,693,4.871794871794871
2072126,4,B00029NLGY,"On one of the bonus features for ""The Prince and Me"" the producer for the film talks about how nobody had ever made a film about a prince who comes to the United States to fall in love with a commoner.  I guess ""Coming to America"" does not count because the prince was looking for a bride over here, unless there is some reason Eddie Murphy's character does not count as a real (read ""European"") prince.  That seems a strange justification for recycling this particular story on a par with saying a war movie would be something new because it takes place in Wisconsin and no war movie has ever been set in Wisconsin.  I pick the Cheese state because ""The Prince and Me,"" like ""Love Actualy,"" thinks that the sexiest women in America are in Wisconsin.  I have to salute whoever is in charge of getting the state good publicity in the movies.

The prince in this case is Edvard Valdemar Dangaard (Luke Mably), who is too busy enjoying the good life and all the women who cling to him everyone he goes to spend much time dealing with the fact he is the heir to the throne of Denmark.  He is apparently so shallow that a tape of ""Girls Gone Wild"" focusing on college coeds in Wisconsin is enough to make him fly off to the U.S.A. to enroll at a college and get a dorm room that he can share with a roommate and still have room for his faithful servant Soren (Ben Miller).  Meanwhile, Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles), a hard working pre-med student who is determined to get into Johns Hopkins and is apparently the last unengaged girl in her farm town back home in dairy country.

Once Eddie, as the prince know wants to be called, shows up on campus Paige is the woman that he is constantly running into, culminating with their faithful coupling as lab partners in a science course.  This does not bode well for her grade in that course given Eddie's inability to show up on time for class, but eventually he starts to hold his own.  Besides, Paige the science wiz is having trouble with her Shakespeare course (an ironic idea given the fact Stiles has done update versions of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and ""Othello"") and Eddie likes to quote from the Bard as a way for making up for an apparently inability to come up with anything bright to say on his own.

These two are going to hate each other and then they are going to fall in love.  Then she is going to find out who he really is and that is going to cause problems for a while.  He is going to visit her farm and she is going to visit his castle.  His parents are going to have something to say about her.  She is going to have to decide between career and family.  It is so hard for this sort of plot line to get away from all of the Cinderella cliches that it is easy to lose sight of some of the more interesting twists in this particular version of the tale and the fact that there are some charming moments.  In terms of the later I will point to what may be the most romantic way of offering a girl a ring that I can have ever seen.

Unfortunately when ""The Prince and Me"" gets to the most interesting part, which deals with what sort of queen is needed in a country like Denmark in the 21st century, the movie is about over.  I understand that this movie is targeted at teenage girls who want to believe in the fantasy that they can find their own Prince Charming, even if he is not the heir to a real European throne, and that such an audience is not interested in the material practice of the contemporary monarchy.  But one of the things I liked about this movie was the idea that Paige forces Eddie to grow up so that he is actually interested in being a good monarch and helping his country.  This is a good thing, because his ailing father (Edward Fox) has to abdicate his crown just as a strike is about to cripple the country.

Besides, this issue is a concern of Eddie's mother (Miranda Richardson), who has to revise her initial opinion about Paige.  But the happy ever after here has to do with the romance and not the state of Denmark and I actually give this film points for not having a big wedding as the obvious grand finale.  The chief attraction is Stiles, who cannot help but communicate intelligence as an actress.  Fortunately the script does not force her to do any of the dumb things that often happen to such characters; that all happens to her prince.  This is much more her film than his, and it is believable that she has a conflict of the head and the heart at the end.  There are enough sweet moments and Stiles is definitely likeable so it is easy to give this film one more star than this year's horrid ""A Cinderella Story.""",1095897600,2,4613,4.290657439446367

But, what I really liked was that each person (Paige and Eddie) was the better for knowing the other.  They grew each other up into better people.

Meanwhile a TV commercial will turn the fate of this couple when the son of the king f Denmark watchs a sexy advertising about the girls of Wisconsin .

The inner homagge to Shakespeare when they pronounce unforgettable lines of Romeo and Juliet give that film a respectable height and shines by itself . Certainly it won't be a classic , but it gets its purpose . It's funny , very well acted with wonderful locations and dazzling script .

But take a look and you'll find that this 'poor girl meets Prince Charming and lives happily ever after' tale is actually quite well done.  With Martha Coolidge as director ( remember 'Rambling Rose'?) the story takes on rich dimensions that focus on interestingly fleshed out characters.  Julia Stiles is excellent as a farm girl with ambition and intelligence and a biting tongue who falls for a 'runaway prince' (Luke Mably) without being aware of his royal lineage. The college scenes in Wisconsin are 100% Americana, and then the camera switches the story to Denmark and royalty never seemed so beautiful.  The prince's parents, the King - James Fox and the Queen - Miranda Richardson, add dignity to the casting. In all, this is just a bit of fluff, but a tasty bit at that.

The actors are a little young but this is definately not what I would consider teenage comedy fluff.  In fact I would cancel out the comedy part and put it down as a delightful romance movie.

The acting was superb.  I love Julia Stiles and Luke Mably and there is a spark bwtween them.  The plot was excellent.  This show did not try to dumb it down for the audience, the ending was slightly awkard but on the whole I think it's the best romance movie I've seen in the past few years.

SPOLIERS

Premise: Prince of Denmark: playboy, spoiled.  Farmgirl: intelligent, hardworking and trying to get into med school.  Prince decides he needs a change of pace, sees a commercial about ""Wild Girls of Wisconsin"" and so enrolls into school there.  (OK the reasoning was pretty darn weak, esp for a prince but he's supposed to be shallow)

They meet, he's a jackass and she hates him on sight. They somehow end up in a Bio Chemistry lab class which is wierd cos why would he take Bio Chem? Anyway the show really picks up from here on and seeing them develop the relationship over 4-5 months which is how long the fall semester is. I especially love the trip they take over thanksgiving to her parent's farm.

Then things fall apart, she discovers he's a prince, they part even though he says he loves her.  She regreats it and flies all the way to Denmark.  He whisks her off on his horse in a passing parade.  They get engaged.

Here's the excellent part, most shows end here, but this one tries to be realistic and she decides to fulfill her dreams of being a doctor, and he becomes king of Denmark.  Tears flow.  And then a happy ending of course.  The method the ending came about was my only gripe about the show.  Honestly, the King of Denmark (or any king) being so... needy was a little hard to take.  He really looks miserable when he said I need/want you and will wait 5-7 years till she becomes a doctor. Ah well... the stuff of dreams.",1093219200,3,2084,4.358441558441559

2072142,2,B00029NLGY,"I was excited to see this movie when I heard the plot--what girl doesn't like the idea of finding Prince Charming? Definitely a lot of potential there, but potential isn't everything. I should have taken a hint that it wasn't much more than cheap fantasy when I learned that Eddie's sole purpose for an American education was to see topless college girls. And that's about as deep as his and Paige's relationship got... except her top stayed on...

He did grow up in some ways--rather dramatically transformed into a capable royal leader. There was a hint in the laundry room that perhaps he was capable of the role all along, but running from it in fear. His attempt at normal life gave him the confidence he needed to take on the challenge. And you could tell there was even more to him below the surface, but sadly, it was never explored.

Paige, on the other hand, had definite goals and abilities from the start. She was very career-focused, but was ""distracted"" as she admitted by a hot body. Whatever happened to soulmates? There was chemistry, but that either blows up or fizzles out over time (and it's no fun to watch a relationship develop with that incessant ticking noise in the background...)

And the ending. I won't give it away, but seriously, who can go out and live life with someone watching over your shoulder and waiting for you to throw in the towel. What are you supposed to say? ""OK, I'm done living now. Your turn."" C'mon.

In short, I was disappointed. Like many movies today, this one falls way short of its potential. Apparently, mature, inspiring characters are even more rare than Prince Charmings. For a (figuratively) real man and woman with a truly enviable love life based on character, I recommend Darcy and Elizabeth in book or film (A&E, or BBC). Other couples with some degree of depth to their persons relationships include Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester (book or BBC), as well as Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe (book and film).",1092441600,,1966,4.689855072463768

In simple terms, the cast was well characterized and balanced, specially Stiles and Mably with thier stunning performances. It's one of the best of Stiles, along side MLS. I even thought Miller's character served the purpose really well. The Limo's were awesome and the Royal exposure was amazingly neat, with the expection of the accents.

Yet, In my opinion, the music throughout the movie is what kept it alive. It defenitly illustrated the blend of comedy and romance. In that perspective Martha Coolidge deserves credit for a superb articulation of the romantic storyline with a passionate approach.

However, one thing that I found to be quite disappointing is the ending. For those who have watched it would know that even though anticipated, it was not the kind of ending one could have expected in a such great story. It was rather fast and inversed to what it was right throughout the movie.

Nevertheless, it was a good one, and I would reccommend it to anyone who loves romantic comedies. and trust me, after watching it, you will defenitely fall in love with Marc Cohn's song.",1090368000,9,1201,4.792270531400966

This movie is funny, witty, sad (only at certain points),and heart warming. It shows how two people who have completely different backgrounds can fall hopelessly in love. It is kind of your typical ""Cinderella"" movie, but it is ten times better. The small town girl has big dreams, not necessarily to meet a prince, but to better herself. Stiles wants to be a doctor and provide medical treatment to poor countries. She meets a cute, funny guy...but at first she finds him completely rude and nothing more but a rich, snot nose brat, which is ironic because he likes her!

Once day he sees this TV commercial with topless girls and it says you will only find it in Wisconsin, so that is why he goes to Wisconsin and meets Paige. Paige, however, doesn't know he is a prince because he changes his named to Eddie not Edward and pretends not to be a prince.  One thing leads to another and Paige finds out he is a prince. This could be a bad thing or a good thing, but I don't want to give away the story. This movie is a great romantic movie. I enjoyed it very much. It was a little funny also. It has a little more depth to it then normal ""chick flicks"" and that is what I like about it. I was impressed. I think this movie is a good family film with children who are in their pre-teens.",1084838400,,934,4.131868131868132
2072147,4,B00029NLGY,"Julia Stiles is sensational in this would be fairy tale movie.  Move over Princess Diaries, theres a new princess on the block.  Julia plays Paige Morgan, a farm girl who has her life all mapped out.  She is going to medical school and becoming a doctor so she can join Doctors without Borders and visit all of the exotic places she has never been able to see.  It's all planned out, that is until she meets Prince Edward.  Edward is a spoiled rich aristocrat with two much time on his hands.  He wants freedom from his heritage and to look at college girls (...), so he leaves Denmark and travels to the heartland of America, Wisconsin to meet naughty American girls.  what he finds is Morgan.  The two make a great pair, and their chemistry is fantastic.  Julia sparkles as always, and Luke Mabry is fantastic as the prince.  The script is deliciously written and the film is a lot of fun.",1083974400,,891,4.444444444444445
2072148,5,B00029NLGY,I absolutely loved this movie! Julia Stiles and Luke Mably are great and I never got bored with the plot- it really didn't seem like 2 hrs! It was a really great feel-good movie that makes you smile.,1083456000,3,199,4.2631578947368425
2072149,5,B00029NLGY,"This fantasy love story was maybe a little predicatable, but had likable characters. I found it enjoyable to have a story that was appropiate for most of the family. It was fun to be swept up in a love story that involved more than hot and heavy sex between a young man and a young woman. The whole story seemed to reminded me of the royal family and how they must live their lives. Maybe, this could be the story of Prince William or Priince Harry. I hope they have a sequel.",1082937600,,476,4.184782608695652
2072150,1,B00029NLGY,I thought okay this movie might be okay. Boy was I wrong. In this movie the normal girl meets the normal boy who turns out to be a prince in disguse. They can't make up thier minds if they want to be together or not. (breaking up at least 4 times in this movie) It totally bored me so good luck if you liked it.,1081728000,,311,3.8
2072151,3,B00029NLGY,"Obviously you can't go to this movie expecting an Oscar caliber film.  However, if you go simply to be entertained for a couple hours, you won't be disappointed. I took my younger cousin and thought it was a very sweet and enjoyable film. There are several inneundos and jokes that only the older people accompanying the young girls in the audience will get. Julia Stiles and Luke Mably were good together and made you want to root for them. Worth the price of a ticket....and this coming from a mature, professional 26 year old.",1081728000,,529,4.627659574468085
2072152,5,B00029NLGY,"The Prince and Me is unique in that it was very entertaining without having violence, gratuitous sex or nasty language. How refreshing. It is a true romance with an independent intelligent female lead. It is well worth seeing if you love romance in a great old fashioned love story. Many romantic moments, strong leads in Julia Stiles and Luke Mably. The writing was wonderful and it kept you in the mood and entertained throughout, building as the movie went along. Go see it and put a smile on your face.",1081555200,6,506,4.633333333333334
2072153,5,B00029NLGY,From the time I had first saw the trailor to the time that I saw it in the movies I thought this movie would be excellent! I was not disapointed. Julia Stiles is perfect for the part in this movie as the determined girl who had a more difficult childhood than the pampered prince who she falls in love with. This movie has scattered humor making this a light hearted fairy tale. The acting is superb! All i can say is WOW WOW WOW WOW!,1081555200,,434,4.117647058823529
2072154,5,B00029NLGY,"This movie has everything you go to the movies for.
I say ""It's the best & funniest romantic comedy of the season.
The only movie I've ever seen with no low point.
The ""one-liners"" are so funny. Acting, was great with a superb cast. 2 thumbs way up!!! A defineat crowd pleaser for everyone.""
If you liked ""The princess diaries"" you'll love this movie.
Go see it today.",1081036800,,368,4.426470588235294
2072155,5,B00029NLGY,"I have to admit I went to this movie thinking it would be just ok. But I came out of the movie very happy and saying ""that was a lot better than I thought it would be!!!"" In fact, this was the most enjoyable movie I've seen since ""Love Actually."" (although the actual style of the movie was nothing like ""L.A."" and was relatively family friendly.) The storyline, while we've seen it told before in a variety of ways (boy meets girl, the fall in love, etc.), had a fresh spin to it. A responsible, intelligent, hard-working college senior meets an incognito prince with no care on his mind except to meet hot American girls. After two meet a friendship forms between them and the story develops. There are a few sappy moments, many funny moments, and in the end it was a feel-good, touching story. The movie was not as predictable as you might think. Although it might be a ""chick flick"" there were some racing scenes thrown in to make it tolerable for all of the boys dragged along with their girlfriends on dates (and I might add that no one in the audience seemed to hate it... there were some funny moments that anyone could appreciate). The actors did a great job, both Stiles and Mably had a great on-screen chemistry and were very convincing as a couple. The movie itself, from the cinematography to the music, did not seem thrown together like most 'pop' movies seem - I could tell it actually had some thought put into it. My only complaint: it is not green in Wisconsin at Thanksgiving! (and Danish people don't all speak in perfect British accents!) But besides a few details like that (which can easily be ignored because the story is more interesting than the scenery) it was overall a surprisingly good and very enjoyable film!",1080950400,3,1740,4.544585987261146
2072156,5,B00029NLGY,"I loved this movie, its now on my top 10. Sure its a chick flick but who cares? This movie is the best love story ever and shows what true love really is.",1080950400,,154,3.696969696969697
2072157,5,B00029NLGY,"Despite the bad reviews, I went to see this film... it was fanstastic!  I could live vicariously through Stile's character Paige with every daydream I've ever had about being swept off my feet...  The charisma and chemistry of these two stars brought this story to life.  It was one of the best chick flicks I've seen in a very long time...  So don't listen to those bad reviews, go see it for yourself or you'll regret wasting all that time waiting for it at the video store.",1080864000,,476,4.436781609195402
2072158,5,B00029NLGY,"I have seen The Prince and Me twice already and I loved all 2 hours of it.  It is a classic fairy tale with a modern twist; the cast will have you laughing the whole way through.  The back drop is breath taking and so is the Prince! This movie will make you forget all about your life and consume you in a ""far far away"" land. All around a good movie for a rainy weekend.",1080777600,,371,3.8684210526315788
