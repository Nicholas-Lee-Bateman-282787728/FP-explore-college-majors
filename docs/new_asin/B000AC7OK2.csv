It has an interesting plot and some really great characters. Once you get into it, it is extremely addictive. Each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. It's a great show for kids and teenagers. It has action without too much violence and it subconsciously conveys the importance of true friendship. This show is child AND parent approved!",1133827200,3,494,4.5

2384405,5,B000AC7OK2,"Code Lyoko is a very different show. I think that all who say its a combination of other shows don't have a clue what they are talking about. There is something strange and fresh about this show it seems different form others and even though I'm not shure why, but one thing i know it that the characters are perfectly captured and impossibly life-like in every way. It is incredible how theese well rounded personalities seem to pop out. They have flaws of course just like every normal person. This is a incredible show. Here are my comments. A truly complex and detailed plot goes into work in this show basically revolving around four teen age children in a boarding school and a young ""human"" who is ""trapped"" in a world called lyoko. Lyoko originally planned as a digital paradise has a few major problems one of them is; the super ""calculator"" or computer has a minor, but uncorrectable glitch. The glitch cannot be fixed because all the scientists who worked on it ""mysteriously"" do not exist anymore. So the super ""calculator"" XANA in code name has a powerful glitch and has decided to claim freedom from those who created it ""humans"" and conquer or destroy the earth whichever comes first. Ulrich, Yumi, Odd, and Jeremie find this super ""calculator"" and the young teenager trapped within it Aelita. Aelita a complex and smart person keeps having strange visions about secrete service agents and others about her mysterious past. Well i have already said too much! It is a very good show with a complex plot that is made clearer in the second season. Too many complaints from people who didn't understand it i think. So I'm 14 years old and like this show allot; thanks for reading this i hope you buy this dvd set even if it doesn't include half the begging. PS: which i saw others might say you aren't missing much, but i don't because it can be hard to piece this show together. Oh and one outher thing i think although it may seem unlikely and kind-of like a fairy tale i think one thing that makes this show so captivateing is that it is the opposite when you really give it some thought. A virus will infect everything even the very thing that gave it birth. Anyways like i was saying before i don't want to write a book. I hope this helped you.",1130371200,15,2260,4.528117359413203
2384406,5,B000AC7OK2,"I have studied this show, although that it is a cartoon, which would make most adults ignore it, it has to do with advanced calculations and programming beyond normal comprehension. Programming into a computer, turning a real world person, and transferring him/her inside of a supercomputer virus running parallel to the human world, which could infect and kill humans. Once you get into this, it is a pretty good show.",1127001600,7,419,5.0

8077740,4,B000AC7OK2,"This DVD contains only 4 episodes: Seeing is Believing, Killer Music, End of Take, Plagued.

Some minor characters are profiled in the extras, along with a few more towers listed in the Holomap, and a Karaoke sing-along.

Nice DVD - too bad when you put the DVD in, the first thing you see is a mandatory, can't-skip-past-it, 70 second commercial for some horrid new cartoon.",1136592000,15,375,4.753846153846154
