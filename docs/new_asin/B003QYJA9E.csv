8402687,5,B003QYJA9E,My wife has been talking about The Tijuana Toads for at least two decades now. We have searched for it far and wide. Found some episodes on Youtube. But no luck on getting a DVD with all the episodes. I bought this recent for our anniversary. The look on my wife's face when she saw what I got her was priceless. (The DVD came in great shape. The sound and quality of the DVD were great as well. Fast shipping. EXCELLENT SERVICE. I am a very satisfied with this. Finally our search has come to end. Happy Ending. Thank you.,1428192000,,523,4.24

8402689,4,B003QYJA9E,"The quality of the humor was exactly how I remember it. Amazingly funny. After the first few episodes the quality of the picture (color/brightness) dropped off tremendously.
 I still enjoyed because of my fondness for the cartoon & the disregard for anything politically correct.",1402790400,2,279,5.340909090909091
8402690,5,B003QYJA9E,"This is such a fun dvd. The two toads remind me a little of the Honeymooners Ralph and Norton. My husband, son and I watched and laughed all the way through.",1281225600,5,157,4.096774193548387
