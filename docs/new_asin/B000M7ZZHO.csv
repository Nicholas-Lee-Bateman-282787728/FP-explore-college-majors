8167115,5,B000M7ZZHO,"This great video is a promotional tape offered by the Walt Disney company for the 100th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Walt Disney. It is mainly promoting the four theme parks in Florida at Walt Disney World, and also has info on vacation planning and hotels. It is unique and is becoming a pricey collectors item, as it was not for sale anywhere. They made a very limited amount, and most were considered disposable as they arrive free in the mail to people on certain Disney mailing lists, such as the old Disney magazine. As I recall it is 30 minutes in length, could be longer. Wish I still had a copy.",1263427200,,607,4.380530973451328
