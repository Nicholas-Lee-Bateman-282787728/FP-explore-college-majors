What we love about Caillou is that both parents and children learn how to behave in a kind and loving manner and how to react to e.g. broken cups or children not behaving well. To be honest, if I'm feeling a bit cranky with the kids or they all go a bit crazy from time to time - I put a DVD of Caillou and they both calm down within 30 seconds (tried and tested!).
If you like your child to learn great manners and learn how to react when things don't go his/her way AND have fun in the process - Caillou is for your family. I'm glad that our daughter also LOVES caillou and Rosie - so we can enjoy this great show for a bit longer. I just wish there were more new episodes.. The last ones were filmed 14 yrs ago.",1437955200,,984,3.900497512437811

I love that they teach from respect for others, how to be nice to his friends and sharing, also how to be nice to his sister and playing with her when his friends are not around.  How he plays with hid grandparents. Which is nice to see exploring and making things with grandma. Love all of them. Thanks",1435017600,,386,4.065789473684211
