6240538,4,B00HX0KIAM,"The beginning months of the year are never the greatest time for comedic films, but you certainly can't go wrong when Kevin Hart is your lead actor. He's quickly rising to the top, starring in popular movies like ""Think Like a Man"" and ""The Five-Year Engagement"" in the past few years. Though his new movie ""Ride Along"" never surpasses some of his more funnier work, that isn't to say it's not good. It had me laughing throughout, and I'm betting it will do the same to you.

The story centers around Ben (Kevin Hart), a fast talking security guard who wants to marry his long-time girlfriend Angela. The only thing standing in his way is her brother James, played by Ice Cube, a decorated police officer who isn't exactly fond of him. In order to prove he's worthy, Ben is forced to go on a ride along and is quickly wrapped up into the scary crime-scene of Atlanta. As you can imagine, the hilarity ensues.

This definitely isn't a movie to take too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it. Hart easily carries the film and provides most, if not all, of the laughs. It may not be the greatest comedy out there, but it would make a killer Friday-night rental. Rated PG-13 for violence and language, ""Ride Along"" is fun and entertaining.",1392508800,,1235,4.533632286995516
6240539,3,B00HX0KIAM,This show has some funny parts to it. Its nothing you would go to the theater and pay a lot of money for.,1392336000,,105,3.608695652173913
6240540,2,B00HX0KIAM,"The set up for this buddy-cop comedy was excellent, but despite a few funny or clever moments, the film was mostly a loud
frenetic series of shoot-outs, car chases, explosions, and yelling.  lce Cube plays a seasoned cop who takes Kevin Hart on a
ride along, to see if he is worthy of marrying Cube's sister.  Of course, he messes up most of his opportunities, and ultimately
comes through.  That was a given.  It was the situations and character development that were lacking, mostly due to a very
pedestrian script.  I just saw ""Bad Grandpa"" two days prior to this, and it was 1000% funnier.",1391904000,4,593,4.609523809523809
6240541,5,B00HX0KIAM,"This movie was much better that I was expecting. It had some great one-liners and is the 1st best comedy of the year. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart were perfectly matched and played to each other's comedy style very well. Hart plays Ben Barber, a jumpy security guard who plays video games and in love with James's sister, Angela. James hates Ben and wants nothing to do with him. When Ben is accepted at the police academy, James decides to take him on a 'ride along' to show him what the police world is really like. Throughout the day, James gives Ben silly assignments that no one else wants. It all leads up to a confrontation with Omar, the main villain that James is obsessed with catching. If you want a good comedy, I highly recommend RIDE ALONG!!!",1391644800,,751,4.449275362318841
6240542,4,B00HX0KIAM,"Ben ""The Black Hammer"" Barber (Kevin Hart) is living with Angela (Tika Sumpter) the sister of super cop James Payton (Ice Cube). Ben works as a school security guard and aspires to be a policeman like James. Ben plays video games and is not highly thought of by James. When Ben asks James permission to marry his sister, James wants Ben to prove himself by going on a ""ride along."" While James puts Ben through the comedy ringer, he is looking for the elusive Omar (Laurence Fishburne), a major crime boss in the city.

The plot was fairly simple and didn't develop the complexity or irony I was hoping for, i.e. Omar being part of Ben's on-line gamers. The comedy was akin to skit comedy with scenes being almost unrelated and the comedy of one scene not building on another. Of course one shouldn't expect too much from the guy who brought us ""Employee of the Month.""

The movie is a good popcorn film good for a few laughs.

6240544,4,B00HX0KIAM,"This movie is very funny! I was very entertained by Kevin Hart and Ice Cube. I feel the jokes were very good. Yes, this is a typical slap-stick movie and that's what I wanted to see. Please don't expect an award winning movie - and that is nominated for this and that - it's not that at all. It just a funny movie that you can just sit down for a hour and half, and laugh at what you're seeing.

Also, don't expect to see something new and ah looking: nope. It's more like seeing something done before, and expecting to see something done stupidly by Hart. Ice Cube plays his character very well to me. He plays a cop that has been through a lot of stuff and is a no mess around guy, which Hart's character is a total opposite of because he just got into the police academy. Yes, this kind of duo has been done before, so if you thought you're going to see something else, don't watch it then. I love seeing this kind of team up and that's why I watched it.

The only thing I didn't like watch that it was kind of short for me. I wanted to see more of it and more funny scenes. They didn't set up the movie do a sequel ending scene so that's good. If there is one though, I probably would go watch it.",1390089600,,1201,4.02092050209205
6240545,4,B00HX0KIAM,"I enjoyed Ride Along. Ice Cube was good as the tough guy. Kevin Hart was funny as Cubes potential brother in law. The laughs and action breezed along at a fast pace. Tika Sumpter was fine as Harts love interest. I just wish that she would stop wearing unflattering wigs in her movies (Sparkle, A Madea's Christmas), they look terrible. Cube should've made sure that the soundtrack was hot and incorporated more hit songs into the soundtrack. The music was ok. Larry Fishburne was great in his role. Everyone in this film delivered. Tim Story should make a sequel. Highly recommended for fans of action comedies!",1390089600,,611,4.773584905660377
6240546,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Here were are, yet again with another team-up cop movie  as if we haven't seen enough of those over the years.  Most recently, Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy starred together in The Heat, but prior to that weve seen an endless array of partnerships over the years, just a few of which include Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, and if you really want to dig deep, then theres Jim Belushi and mans best friend in K-9.  The list of duos is endless and we could sit here all day running down the partnerships, but the bottom line here is that this style of storytelling is so unbelievably tiresome that it needs to stop.  And, if you require proof, just watch the comedy, Ride Along.

Director Tim Story (Think Like a Man, Barbershop) re-teams with both Ice Cube and Kevin Hart in Ride Along.  Ice Cube stars as James Payton, an Atlanta police officer that has been working on a dead-end case, chasing after a ghost arms dealer, known only as Omar.  At the same time, his sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter), has been dating a school security guard and video game addict, Ben (Kevin Hart).  The two are preparing to share the news with James they want to get married.

Ben, like James, has ambitions to be a police officer and applies to the academy, of which he is accepted.  Excited by the acceptance, Ben shares the news with James about the academy and also seeks his approval to marry his sister.  James is immediately dismissive, finding Ben to be horribly irritating, not to mention disapproving of him even dating his sister, let alone marrying her.  Hoping to deter Ben from joining the academy, James decides to take him on a ride along, telling him if he is able to successfully make it through the day, he will give him his blessing  all the while James knowingly takes on all of the police departments most ridiculous calls.

For reasons beyond comprehension, some people seem to be under the impression that Kevin Hart is revitalizing his career by taking on roles of this nature.  If you know anything about Hart or have possibly even seen his act, then you know hes easily comparable to someone like Chris Tucker  meaning a character actor that seemingly never stops talking.  Unfortunately, has to make a comment about anything and everything, and it gets to point in this film where its nearly unbearable.  Hes tries too hard to be funny and in doing so, comes off as insincere and downright stale.  After taking roles in recent films, like Grudge Match, Think Like a Man, and now Ride Along  hes not helping his case to be recognized as a legitimate, reputable actor.

Ice Cube, like Kevin Hart, is also is also a repeat offender when it comes to playing the same role over and over again.  Hart creates brief moments of laughter, but its only due to Ice Cubes serious demeanor.  Cube has a miniscule amount of leading role potential, but he wasted it on sorry films like All About the Benjamins and the Friday sequels.  Still, he has proven to at least be occasionally entertaining, mostly in TV commercials or his role in 21 Jump Street.  He might be the lead in this film, but the plot tries to cater more towards Harts petty excuse for humor  which is vulgar, sexual, and insulting.  Apparently, that can all pass with a PG-13 rating these days.

The majority of the films scenes are just one ridiculous encounter after another  evident in the moments where Harts character attempts to sway a group of bikers to move from a handicapped parking spot or in another scene where its supposed to be funny that a random guy is throwing food in a supermarket.  Is this really what passes for entertainment?  Surely theres better things to spend your money on than watching someone refer to his nether region as Black Hammer or fight with someone in a cop car over who gets to say roger that.

If theres one actor I really feel bad for, its Lawrence Fishburne.  Theres really nothing more irritating than to see a talented actor lending his time to a horrendous film.  To make matters worse, Ride Along tries to make it seem like a big shocker that Fishburne shows up towards the end as the villain.  He was prominently advertised in the opening credits, which makes it painfully obvious he was going to be the villain.  And, when he finally does show up  it leads to a completely predictable and uneventful showdown.

Overall, Ride Along is about as entertaining as the commercial advertisements make it out to be.  There are brief moments of laughter, but nothing that youll point to and say that was the funniest moment in the film.  The puns are repetitive and childish, while the acting is mediocre and tedious.  Kevin Hart continues the trend of making himself a part of dull-witted films, while Ice Cube continues his trend of portraying hard-nosed characters.  Already, word has spread that Ride Along will receive the sequel treatment  after shocking the box office by earning a hefty payday.  However, if you plan to shell out cash to watch such a ridiculous movie, don't be surprised when you feel foolish for doing so after its over.

6240547,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Director Tim Story (""Think Like a Man"") brings us a crowd pleaser that had the screening audience laughing from the first frame. Of course that is partly due to the great popularity of fast-talking Kevin Hart, but this silly odd couple-based story is fun. Any self-respecting police department would NEVER allow the sorts of capers we see, but what's a few plot holes between friends? It certainly didn't handicap writers Greg Coolidge (""Baby Mama"") and Jason Mantzoukas (Lots of TV) as they pile laugh upon laugh while we happily suspend disbelief.

Even through our hero is steadily employed as a security guard, he really, REALLY wants to be an Atlanta police officer like his finance's brother James. He feels prepared, after all, he has played a cop in countless video games. There are three important things in his life: Being a cop, those video games and his gorgeous fianc&eacute;e Angela.

We watch:
  * Kevin Hart (""Grudge Match"") is our hero Ben, who has finagled a ride in a cop car with his potential brother-in-law to prove he is worthy to marry into the family. (Every legitimate PD in the country is shaking its collective head.)
  * Tika Sumpter (""Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas"") plays our hero's lovely sweetheart, Angela. This patient gal seems to find his immature ADHD-type personality appealing.
  * Ice Cube (""21 Jump Street"") brings us James, a no-nonsense cop who has trust issues, particularly with this haywire fruitcake his sister Angela has unaccountably fallen for.
  * Bruce McGill (""Lincoln"") will always convince ME that he is a tough but fair police captain who is running out of patience: Detective James is highly effective, but his unorthodox methods are difficult to justify.

Of course we have other cops who help our hero when he needs backup, plus a surprise mystery guest whom I won't divulge because he is uncredited, so that would be a spoiler.

This is PG-13, so expect mild profanity, no nudity, no sweaty bodies, some vehicular mayhem and a LOT of gunfire! By the time Ben gets his hands on a loaded gun, I was ready to slap him! I've been around guns all my life and have never see such careless mishandling! I know, I know, it's a comedy, but....

Even doing a movie of these two doing Drivers Ed..would be better.(if you do that hollywood let me sit in the script room..to edit bad ideas out) .maybe that is what is wrong with this movie is the overly done cop role taken too seriously ..that is a stale idea..Lets be Cops was far more fun. keep this team but make a better movie with them in it!,1490745600,,885,4.151162790697675

Ice Cube had better chemistry with those comics in FRIDAY and ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS than he did with Kevin Hart in RIDE ALONG. Hart in borderline manic. Maybe better writing or direction could have guided Hart into a funnier performance and maybe Hart is trying to hard to take center stage.

Hoping it would find its footing, I stuck with RIDE ALONG through every missed attempt at comedy and each failed chance to develop the story you hope will get you to care about the characters.

To my surprise, the other day I saw a preview of a second RIDE ALONG.  I guess enough people liked this movie more than I did.  While most sequels are not as good as the original, I can't see how part two could be any worse.",1448755200,,679,4.1923076923076925

When Hart wants to get the blessing of Cube to marry Cube's sister, Cube takes Hart on a one-day police ride along and hilarity ensues.",1420070400,,419,4.441558441558442

6241274,4,B00HX0KIAM,"This was a great movie.  The storyline was so much better than other recent cop movies (*examples below), with big comedy stars, that fail.  The nerdy jokes about online gameplay really modernized the whole good cop - dumb cop dynamic.

A quick summary of the film:  Kevin Hart wants to prove that he is man enough to marry Ice Cube's sister.  Ice Cube plays a police officer so Kevin Hart decides he will go on a Ride Along to prove himself and also test his own aspirations of being a cop.  The movie also stars Laurence Fishburne and John Leguizamo.  I would love to see a sequel on this one.

I am sure many detractors will say that 21 Jump Street - and now 22 Jump Street - were funnier, but I felt the dialogue and sequences in those films were too predicatable.  I know that was part of the humor and intention, but then why am I paying for a movie I can completely predict?  Also 22 Jump Street was just a lazy sequel.

All of us enjoyed it, and laughed at the verbal & sight gaga, but it's not something most people would want to see a second or third or twentieth time, like, say an Eddie Murphy film. The action (plot) is about 98% predictable, a standard US B-film mix of action (80%) and romance/sex (20%). A nice innocuous first-teen-date film, or a family movie night film (for those over ages 12-13).",1416355200,,475,4.666666666666667

Imagine the quick wit of Eddie Murphy, the hyperactivity of Chris Tucker, and the improvisation skills of the late Robin Williams and that's what comes to mind with Hart's performance here.  When you're doing comedy you walk the tightrope and Tucker navigates the terrain beautifully.  Ice Cube is essentially the straightman to Hart's antics and he fills the bill wonderfully.  He probably had to bite his lip to contain the laughter with some of Hart's more outrageous moments.  Regardless this mismatched pairing delivers the goods.

The plot is straight out of every other cop buddy film, but there is a reason why these plots work.  They tell a good story.  Kevin Hart and Ice Cube are great as potential brothers-in-law.  I particularly liked the over achiever in Kevin Hart's character.  He is a good man who wants his fiancee to be proud of him.  She is proud of him ;ready, but he feels like if he just gets the brother's approval, he'll be in.  The brother is already a police officer and so he attempts to show his potential brother-in-law the ropes hoping to discredit him and make him see that he isn't qualified to do more than his middle school guard job.  In the end, they become friends and everyone lives happily (how could you not with Kevin Hart) ever after.  A tried and true plot line excellently delivered by the actors.",1409270400,,884,4.475

6241454,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Ride Along is another overrated buddy cop team up with a watered down pg-13 rating. Ice Cube has been known for playing the opposite side of the law and now is hard to see him playing a police officer,especially when his early music was about breaking the law and murder. Kevin Hart is the same as you have always seen him. Mostly jokes about his height which gets old and being a wanna be cop while working as a security guard. His best movie IMO was SoulplaneHart is no Chris Tucker or Dave Chappelle,since neither of them have been in the spotlight recently Hart takes over the leading role. The villian is a fifty pound overweight Laurence Fishburne who barely has any character development and mostly shows up at the end of the movie. Same cliche story there is a smuggler whose identity cannot be found and never gets caught,aftewards he has been bribing police officers and the mole is found. Police man teams up with underdog and then proves himself that he can be part of the team. This movie would of been more entertaining if it had an R rating. Both Ice Cube and Hart would of had better dialogue using more profanity and you can tell that in the script the dialogue was limited and often corny. Watch better R rated and better action movies like:48 hours 1&2,Lethal Weapon movies,2 Guns,Rush Hour movies",1407715200,,1316,4.580508474576271

6241485,5,B00HX0KIAM,"This would have to be one of the top ten comedy's to come out for a long time. Storyline is fantastic and the actors performed at their best and what could you ask for more than this. A story that everyone can relate to when a family member sister wants a blessing in the family. So they put up with a some what boyfriend who is, well I'm not saying and a big brother who stands in their way of happiness. I know that it sounds like a lot of other movies but this one is different and grabs you by the hand not letting go, there are times you do and times you don't and boy does he get into trouble. A big brother cop and a little lover trying to prove he belongs in the family group will he be accepted or not now that is the answer,  which I will leave up to you  and let you decide I rated this an A grade plus for the thrills and errors that come about in the movie so now it's time to collect the popcorn gather up your movie retire to the lounge put your feet up and become engrossed in a fabulous night of entertainment of laughter and fun.

It wouldve been the worse, but I expected more from I, Frankenstein and that was just so disappointing that I have that one as the worst movie so far this year. I would not have watched Ride Along voluntarily but a friend rented it and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I hate it when they get an actor, like Kevin Hart, who is kind of the flavor of the month and put them into a vehicle movie that was thrown together hap-hazardly. As my friend would say, You gotta be a fan. I like Kevin hart, but I wouldnt say Im a huge fan, certainly not big enough to enjoy this movie. Kevin Hart wants to marry Ice Cubes sister. Ice Cube doesnt like him. Kevin Hart wants Ice Cubes approval. Ice Cube is cop, so he takes Hart on a ride along with him to work. Of course Cube is trying to discourage Hart, so he will stay away from Cubes sister, but Hart is a resilient all be it pretty stupid guy. Completely implausible plot, but thats not really the complaint I have. Its just not funny. I don't think I laughed once. The jokes are so old and over-used. They shouldve gotten better writers to write a funnier script.",1405555200,,1176,4.139737991266376

6241595,3,B00HX0KIAM,"There are plenty of hilarious moments in Ride Along, most of them involving Kevin Hart's antics to try to gain respect from his girlfriend's brother and everyone around him. Parents should know that the PG-13 rating is really stretching it here, as there's lots of innuendo (specifically at the beginning when the main character and his girlfriend talk explicitly about their ""night plans"") and gun violence. Some of it is good-natured, and some of it isn't. Fortunately, the tone of the movie is consistently playful and entertaining throughout, and it avoids boring stretches of time or weird shifts in theme. That definitely makes a type of movie like Ride Along recommendable for anyone wanting to see an hour-and-a-half worth of well-paced comedy.

It's not at all original, a criticism that has been the main reason for the film's low rating on popular sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Most of the twists and surprises don't make the film any different from other buddy cop movies. The plot almost feels like a pit stop between moments where Kevin Hart isn't showcasing his humor. And with the slight exception of Hart, most of the acting is quite generic, like the plot itself. In particular is Ice Cube, who's really just in the movie to play the non-comedic foil.

The good news is that the screenwriters didn't dwell too much on trying to sell you on those aspects. Instead it's more focused on trying to make you laugh, something that this movie does well. Because of the great timing and spacing of the many jokes in the film, the shortcomings won't prevent you from enjoying Ride Along. Viewers should go in expecting a genuinely funny movie, because that's all this type of film really needs anyway.",1404000000,,1717,4.856655290102389

6241623,3,B00HX0KIAM,Ice Cube was great as the serious older brother of the girl Kevin is seeking to marry.  Kevin's role kissing up to the older brother and police detective to score some respect however was a bit too slapstick and over the top otherwise I would've given this movie a 4.

6241626,2,B00HX0KIAM,"First of all I will say that I laughed at most of the jokes in this movie, but (to me) ICE CUBE is one of those actors that can be over the top and really starts to annoy me.

And to answer those who say, ""that is who he is"".  I understand that his persona is a ""Tough Guy"", but lets all be realistic... Would you spend all day watching that and not get annoyed at some point?

Anyway on to more review... I really think Kevin Hart can be funny, but I guess I would have toned down the bravado of I'm gonna prove I am a ""Tough Guy"" under tone of the movie as it started to make the show very unrealistic to me.

So in the end, I give it only two stars.  I walked away from this with the opinion that I would rather watch another 'Rush Hour' movie than this one at all.",1403136000,,768,3.8354430379746836

This is that movie.
Ice Cube is flat out horrible in this movie.  He is an angry cop and that means he talks tough and scowls throughout the entire movie.  Boring as hell.
I have seen Ice Cub in many movies and really like what he did with his character.  Not this time!

Kevin Hart.  People say he is funny and I am willing to see another movie of his, but he was not that funny in this movie.  Maybe he was trying to save the movie, but he over did everything to the point of ridiculous.

I wished they made Kevin Hart really truly believable as the bad guy and loved the references to Training Day.  I think they could have added more fun to this movie.  Most movies being made nowadays seem to have more of the you're my buddy so you are in the movie feel, than actual acting.

Ride Along isn't technically a cop buddy comedy - seeing as one of the characters isn't actually a cop - though the movie follows the basic formula almost to a tee.

Ice Cube plays James Payton, an Atlanta police officer who doesnt much care for the man his sister (Ika Sumpter) is currently dating, one Ben Barger (Kevin Hart), a neer-do-well goofball who works as a security guard at a high school when he isn't sitting at home on the couch playing video games. Ben does, however, suffer from delusions of grandeur when it comes to what he plans to do with his life, which is to use his skills as a gamer to become one hell of a real life crime fighter. James agrees to take Ben on a ride along in his squad car to see if he has what it takes to be a cop. Hilarity ensues.

Or at least it would if the one-joke premise didn't run out of steam about a half hour into the movies running time. Actually, Ride Along starts off on a promising note, with breezy, fast-paced dialogue and a genuine rapport established between Hart as the comic cutup and Ice Cube as his requisite straight man (think of them as an African-American version of Martin and Lewis).

But the concept begins to pall early on, as too many of the scenes run on well past their sell-by dates as far as generating any further laughs is concerned. A pity, in that, given better material, Hart, especially, might have made something decent out of Ride Along.",1401580800,,1431,4.388679245283019

What follows?  Use your imagination.  It won't take much. I am tired of black producers (and white producers) making ""junk movies"" for black audiences.  Yes, this is mainly a movie  made for black audiences.  White audiences only go see black movies if ""popular, white actors"" are in them.  Ice Cube, and other black directors and producers are now taking ""white theme"" movies and placing black actors in them...the result is pure ""boredom.""  I miss the old days of ""Car Wash,"" and ""Shaft..."" while those movies perpetrated the ""black pimp"" stereotype, they were entertaining and very funny.  Kevin Hart, can be funny (he is a stand-up comic), but I did not find him very funny in this movie...perhaps it was the bad script.  He was much funnier in the movie, ""About Last Night.""  My advice to him is for him to attempt other types of ventures...other than comedies, to avoid becoming typecast as a ""self-deprecating"" comic.  The movie grossed over one-hundred million, so we know there WILL be a re-make.  Oh, well...its all about money these days.",1401580800,,1250,4.807511737089202

Kevin Hart's antics always make me laugh and he is his same fast talking silly self in this movie as well and with Ice Cube playing the straight man, the combination has moments that are funny.  The problem though as the funny moments seem to get less and less as the movie goes along, almost as if the movie starts taking itself a bit too seriously.

6241725,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Let's say your dad owns a movie studio. You're content to lie around all day, living the high life off of his dime. But he's annoyed with your slacker ways. In an attempt to get you to actually do something with your life -- anything! -- he tosses $25,000,000 dollars in your lap and orders you to make a movie.

""But Daaaad,"" you whine. ""I don't wanna!""

""No son of mine is going to waste his life playing video games and smoking those herbal jazz cigarettes and getting fat on Moon Pies!"" he barks. ""Make a movie!""

""But Daaaad,"" you whine. ""I don't even have a story!""

""Make a buddy-cop action flick,"" he demands. ""Those are easy. One of the cops will be tough and no-nonsense. The other one will be a goofy, bumbling idiot who's over his head. Through various hi-jinks, they'll learn to respect each other. Also, there should be some kind of serious plot that leads to a big, explosive climax. Make it about drugs. No, wait. Drugs are played out. Guns. Make it about guns. The bad guys should be some kind of race that you won't get into trouble for stereotyping. Croatian. No, wait. Our maid is Croatian. I've got it! Serbian. Serbian bad guys with guns.""

""But I don't know what I'm doing,"" you whine.

""Don't worry about it,"" your dad waves. ""Also, I'll get Laurence Fishburne to be in it. He owes me a big favor.""

""Really? Why?""

Your dad smiles knowingly. ""HE knows why.""

So, to prepare, you sit down with some herbal jazz cigarettes and  watch every buddy-cop film you can find, occasionally remembering to take notes on the plot elements that pop up most frequently. Then, surly and unmotivated, you write your movie. The script turns out to be twelve pages long, and most of that is about first-person shooter games.

""Daaaaad,"" you whine. ""Writing a movie is hard! My script is too  short!""

""Don't worry about it,"" your dad says. ""Get a popular comedian in one of the lead roles and just let him ad-lib and mug and riff all over the place. Make sure a camera is running on him at all times. Let him do whatever he wants. Also, give him a girlfriend who is impossibly good-looking and who runs around half-naked for most of the film. Are you writing this down?""

So, finally, you make your film. You put some of your favorite songs in it, even though they don't really match the action or story. You edit it while smoking herbal jazz cigarettes, so sequences and plotlines don't totally line up right. Laurence Fishburne is so disgusted with you that he phones in almost his entire performance along with pretty much everyone else except for your comedic lead, who throws himself into the role like a coke-era Robin Williams. Behind your back, people grumble about what a schlocky, sloppy, uninspired mess the film is, the only decent aspect of it being -- ironically -- the inside jokes related to video games. But you finally finish it.

""Can I go now?"" you grumble to your dad.

""Yes, son,"" he says. ""I'm proud of you son.""

""Proud?"" you sneer. ""I barely even tried.""

""I know,"" he grins lovingly. ""And you just made us over one hundred million dollars.""

""Wow,"" you say. ""That's amazing!""

Your dad blinks away the dollar signs in his eyes and says, ""If you ever get the urge, do you have a sequel in you?""

6241756,2,B00HX0KIAM,"Wow, what a disappointing comedy.  Ice Cube pretending to be tough.  Kevin Hart pretending to be soft.  Using bland humor and cutesy buddy comedy twists and hoping we giggle like schoolgirls.

The plot is easy to figure out, with a lot of attempts at being funny that totally fail.  If you laugh at all, it is because of Kevin Hart.  And the laughs don't come that often.  He is underused, which stinks.  Then you have Leguizamo who is in the film as a manikin, basically.  He is woefully underused as well.

There is an entertaining action sequence in the end, but everything up until then is just bland.  You can see there were quite a few scenes where Hart could have shined, but the film makers chose to accept the boring cut and move on.  Lazy production.

NEVER BUY THIS.  You might want to finish it, but you will never watch it twice.  You are much better off renting Kevin Hart's stand-up specials.  If you want to see Ice Cube in a much tougher role, rent Ghosts of Mars.  He co-stars with Jason Statham before he was famous.",1400457600,,1035,4.420212765957447

Ride Along was boring with a capital B to us, and we did not have even one ""laugh out loud"" moment. Seems a couple of small chuckles arose, as we remained hopeful.

I expected more from these two actors, and was glad we only paid a buck and half for the rental.

His girlfriend's dominating, intimidating super-cop brother, James.  In an effort to discourage Ben, James decides to take his would-be brother-in-law on a ride along, all while tracking down mysterious criminal kingpin Omar.

I don't like a lot of his films, but I'm a pretty big Kevin Hart fan; he's got comedic timing that you rarely see these days.  And there's no denying that no one does tough like Ice Cube.  The two have pretty good chemistry, too, and their scenes together are among RIDE ALONG's best.  Also along is a surprisingly strong supporting cast: John Leguizamo, Bruce McGill, Bryan Callen, and especially Laurence Fishburne.  Unfortunately, they are hindered by a so-so script that goes from super-budget action (in the first five minutes, Ice Cube drives a souped up pickup through an explosion, and while it's a draw-dropping effect, our disbelief can only be suspended too far), to rom-com, to bromance, to...well, you get the idea.  RIDE ALONG doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  The best scenes have a feel of improvisation (you can see Ice Cube on the verge of laughter multiple times), where the story takes a backseat to the actors' chemistry.  This film is good for killing a couple of hours, but I won't go to great effort to see it again.

I would tell him not to stray out side of his comfort zone when accepting roles. Try not to get type casted by the public.

Ice Cube is the only thing good about this film, but even his acting was sub par.  This was clearly a cheap production and a pay grab for the known actors in the film.  The directing was horrible with poor timing and hardly any musical accompaniment.  Kevin Hart was his typical loud, rude and annoying self - ZERO funny jokes!  They tried to make this Hart's Eddie Murphy ""48 Hours"" moment,  but Hart is not funny and he does not have the charisma to pull anything off.  All he does is talk loud, act stupid and makes Amos N Andy type faces.

It is sad that they are working on another as we speak, and by the time I am done writing this review, it should be finished!  That is about as much time as they took to make this garbage.  I would bet that box office receipts were forged in order to help Kevin Hart's deal with the devil for his fame, because word of mouth alone should have buried this film!  It is not that I am a Hart hater - I give everyone a chance, but this guy does not have IT, he had to have it given to him, and it shows from his uninteresting and unfunny performances.

If you must see this just to see it, then do it.  However, I would never buy this and it is hard to watch one time, let alone twice.  Hollywood, do us all a favor and retire Kevin Hart.

Sorry, there was no real chemistry between them. The moments that Kevin Hart had were sometimes funny, sometimes strained. Ice Cube was a great straight man but he is a proven actor in both comedy, drama's and Sci-Fi.
The entire premise was that Kevin Hart is engaged to Ice Cube's sister and she wants them both to get along, it's important to her that her big  brother approve. Okay, a storyline that has proven to be hit and miss before and this time it's a miss. Like I said, there is no chemistry between the two men that could have made this into a great comedy. Is Kevin Hart funny, yes he is and he does have a few scenes where he is hilarious but not enough to save the movie. It's good to pass a couple of hours but Ice Cube's talent is wasted here.",1399507200,,923,4.099447513812155

If you took Friday, turned Ice Cube into what's supposed to be a tough-as-nails cop, and made Chris Tucker this very un-funny short dude, you'd have Ride Along. The plot was crap (the whole king-pin gangster, police corruption bit), and the humor was tired. That little guy talks more than most Tarantino characters, and screams like a girl the whole movie.

Same old ""hard ass"" routine*yawn) Kevin Hart just seemed so....awkward. I really should have rented something else because this was a waste of time and money.
Kevin Hart should really just do stand up and Ice cube should stick to the ""Friday""series if he insists on acting. He is definitely no Will Smith.",1398643200,,684,4.708333333333333
6241913,3,B00HX0KIAM,it was ok.  I like Kevin Hart and Ice cube but it didn't make me laugh like I expected oh,1398643200,,89,3.45
6241914,3,B00HX0KIAM,It was ok Kevin's always gonna make things funny! The movie was predictable but nowadays what movies aren't. Good cast good acting!!!,1398643200,,133,5.090909090909091
6241915,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Didn't make it all the way through this one.  The trailer had all the ""funny"" stuff.  The rest of it was Ice Cube doing his acting schtick, which consists of 3 different types of scowls.  Not a funny movie, an attempt at a twist on the two cop comedy formula.  Fail.",1398556800,2,266,4.1568627450980395
6241916,4,B00HX0KIAM,"Good laugh, i enjoyed watching the movie. Kevin hart makes the movie, ice cube today was a good day. Yes",1398556800,,104,4.25
6241917,1,B00HX0KIAM,I was very disappointed not funny at all really kind of boring nothing like what they show on the trailer!,1398556800,,106,4.35
6241918,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Awful movie, not what I expected from Kevin hart, had a childish and unrealistic tone throughout and not funny enough for a guy who is usually making people roll on floor laughing",1398556800,2,179,4.625
6241919,1,B00HX0KIAM,"I like Ice Cube and Kevin Heart but this movie was a little too cheesy. I didn't care for Ice Cubes character. He was angry, but for what? And came off as a ""tough guy"" because he can scowl well? Kevin Hearts character was down right annoying. I regretted spending the money and stopped watching about 20 minutes in.",1398556800,,316,4.372881355932203
6241920,5,B00HX0KIAM,"It was a really enjoyable movie, funny the whole way through, I laughed hard at the 'training day' references! Hearing Kevin Hart channel his inner Denzel was hilarious!",1398556800,,169,5.071428571428571
6241921,5,B00HX0KIAM,Great movie! I recommend 17 and over to go and see this movie! I really enjoyed laughing throughout the movie.,1398556800,,110,4.55

6241923,5,B00HX0KIAM,Funny and entertaining!!  Kevin Hart never disappoints. The guy is a clown and always portrays the biggest ego with his Napoleon complex. I would highly recommend this move to anyone.,1398556800,,183,5.1
6241924,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Stupid and predictive
Teenager movie. Nothing original about this movie.  Slap stick to the max.

6241925,3,B00HX0KIAM,Not as funny as I thought it would be but had it's moments.  Kevin Hart and Ice Cube are a pretty good team.,1398470400,,108,3.6956521739130435
6241926,1,B00HX0KIAM,I waited to rent...and should have kept waiting.  This comedy feels lazy and is just not funny. ..I can take a silly plot if the characters mesh well and deliver. The fact that this got so much hype is amazing.,1398470400,,210,4.25
6241927,4,B00HX0KIAM,"In this, Ice Cube reminds me of the same ""hard-ass"" he was in 21 jump street. He was the Captain of Jump Street just as he is a police officer in this film. Kevin Hart wasn't THAT bad in this movie. There were some funny parts I must admit, my father-in-law was laughing quite a bit during the movie before I left. He said he enjoyed it so I decided to put it in when I got home. I've seen it twice so far and each time, I find myself laughing at the same parts. I wouldn't say this is a ""terrible"" movie. Just like any others, it has its moments but it might not keep your attention as much as you'd like it too.",1398470400,,613,3.912
6241928,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Another stupid offensive stereotypical buffoon movie. Just because i'm black doesn't mean I have to like this moronic movie. I told myself I would give it a chance, however this is one of the dumbest things i've seen in life. I wish Kevin Hart and Ice Cube would disappear under a f***ing rock and take Tyler Perry and every rapper alive with them. I'll stick to movies like After Earth from now on. That was the best movie ever totally under rated.",1398470400,,449,4.487804878048781

6241930,1,B00HX0KIAM,It was really bad. No plot. Not even funny. Por acting all around. Don't watch it save your money for a better movie.,1398470400,,117,4.130434782608695
6241931,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Kevin Hart is hilarious as usual.  The movie itself had a  typical story-line with predictability, however, Kevin's natural comedic ability makes it worth watching.  Ice Cube was decent but if you are familiar with any of his acting work, he is typecasted as usual, being the mean guy.  Again, the movie does have plenty of funny moments that make you laugh so to me, that's worth the time.",1398470400,,390,4.6911764705882355
6241932,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Picked this movie because the previews all looked hilarious. Well they did show all the good parts in the previews. The rest of the movies was boring. Thought there would be more funny scenes but there wasn't. The plot was so, so and kind of predictable. Not bad but I wouldn't watch it again.",1398470400,,293,4.444444444444445

6241934,1,B00HX0KIAM,It was awful and Not funny. The script was stupid and predictable. And Ice Cubes stupid faces get old quick. Bad movie,1398470400,,118,4.409090909090909
6241935,5,B00HX0KIAM,Great movie get ready to laugh from beginning credits to ending credits. This movie is a must see. I give it 5+stars.,1398470400,6,117,4.363636363636363

6241937,4,B00HX0KIAM,"I watched this movie for the first time and found it to be HILARIOUS!!! My biggest problem is the disc. It doesn't have the last used memory like other disc and sometimes it freezes my blu-ray player when trying to load. I have to eject and try again and it works fine. Other than that, great product.",1398470400,,301,4.298245614035087

6241939,3,B00HX0KIAM,"But there were too many points in the movie where I had a better idea of what should have happened next....or I said ""you know what would have been funnier""..... I like the writers to be more awesome than I would be.

And how the heck did those two afford such a nice apartment when they were just starting out? -And if the girlfriend was doing that well, why be fuzz..?",1398384000,,370,4.211267605633803
6241940,4,B00HX0KIAM,"I enjoyed this movie. It's what you'd expect it to be...it's a comedy and good for a few laughs. It's perfect for when you're in the mood to be entertained. If you're looking for a deep, complex plot and lots of character development, you might want to pick something else.",1398384000,,273,4.48
6241941,1,B00HX0KIAM,"I hate these comedy movies now-a-days that are just trying so hard that its so obvious. This is one of those movies. Kevin Hart tries so hard with his ""clueless"" kind of humor. I read on direct tv it had  93% rating. Boy was that off. STUPID!!!",1398384000,,244,4.191489361702128

6241945,1,B00HX0KIAM,"The only thing funny about this movie was that I paid to watch it.

No chemistry closely followed by no plot. I real shame that the actors/comedians did not have the opportunity to shine.",1398297600,5,187,4.5
6241946,5,B00HX0KIAM,"What a seriously funny movie. Enjoyed it so much that it will be a movie that I will purchase for my video library. It is rated R, so not for kids. Sexual innuendoes and violence scenes...Just saying.",1398297600,,200,4.4324324324324325

6241949,3,B00HX0KIAM,This was a good movie for laughs.  Kevin Hart is so funny and Ice Cube does a good job in his role. The story line kept us interested.  It actually has a decent story!  We own it and I can't wait to watch it again with my son.,1398297600,,226,3.6666666666666665

6241951,1,B00HX0KIAM,"One of the most un-funny movies I have seen in a long time. I am a HUGE Ice Cube fan since his time in NWA (of course), but this movie has the same dimensions as his Ride Along movies. His last good movie was Friday (CLASSIC!). I am also a fan of Kevin Hart, but his comedy and jokes are wasted here, he comes off as more hyper than funny. I almost laughed once, but not quite. And comedy is one of my favorite things in the world. Also the gag reel left me wondering when the funny part was coming and it never did.",1398297600,,516,3.9238095238095236

6241954,3,B00HX0KIAM,"I like it!  Sometimes it seems like directors like to give the comedy more emphasis than the plot-line; however, this was not the case with this movie.  I thought it was a good blend of humor and plot-line.",1398297600,,206,4.394736842105263
6241955,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Ice Cube is portrayed as some type of major badass in the movie, but you never can tell why. He's mostly just angry and scowls a lot. Other guy is just marginally funny, and never shuts up. Abundance of d*ck jokes. Actually regretted selecting this about 15 minutes in.",1398297600,5,269,4.510204081632653

6241968,4,B00HX0KIAM,Doesn't really get funny until towards the end. It seems to be good. There was not enough chemistry between Kevin and Ice C. It seemed as though they were reading their lines a lot throughout the movie.,1398211200,,202,4.486486486486487

6241985,5,B00HX0KIAM,Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are great together in this movie. Kevin Hart is hilarious as ever and Ice Cube has that sarcastic humor he always has in his other movies. I loved it.

6242002,5,B00HX0KIAM,"This movie provided me many full belly laughs at a time when I needed them.
One could try to compare this movie to many successful previous attempts over the past few decades.  However, to me, this movie should be considered the exemplar.  Creatively done at every step.  ICE CUBE and KEVIN HART have perfect chemistry and pull off for me an Awesome 5 Star movie.",1398038400,,363,4.553846153846154
6242003,5,B00HX0KIAM,"This movie choice was right on time for my wife and I as we were looking for an opportunity to share a good laugh--this movie fit the bill. It is as much a comedy flick as it is an action movie which makes it perfect for those who cannot agree on a specific genre for the evening.
Ice Cube is Ice Cube which is refreshing for those of us who like his brand. It was very surprising to see John Leguizamo in his role which added to the overall dynamic of the story as it unfolded. Finally, that crazy Kevin Hart was just a good with Ice Cube as Chris Tucker, and Mike Epps were in their side kick roles--and they were great!",1398038400,,622,4.065040650406504

And from what the commercial and supposedly all the critics claimed, it was ""laugh out loud"" hilarious. Yeah, well that was a lie. While Ice Cube and Kevin Hart had semi-good chemistry, there was nothing in this movie that made me laugh very hard, not even a chuckle. It was just lame and Kevin Hart really got on my nerves. The story was predictable and wasn't enough to hold my attention. I really wish this movie was better, I expected so much more from Ice Cube. What a waste of 2 hours! Not worth the rental fees!!",1398038400,2,606,4.324561403508772

Lazy acting.  Script so lazy it's hard to know if the writers were competing in a ""how many cliches can you stuff in a movie"" contest.",1397865600,7,412,4.151898734177215

6242067,5,B00HX0KIAM,"Ice Cube plays as the full fledged detective, James, on the lead of an elusive kingpin in Atlanta, and Kevin Hart plays as, Ben, a CoD/Battlefield (aka shooter video game) security guard who dreams of becoming a detective. Of course, Ben is also dating James' sister and James does not think Ben is worthy to do so. Ben is offered the opportunity to enter the Atlanta Police Academy to become a real cop, and gets the opportunity to ""ride along"" with James in the Atlanta beat for one day...and the duo encounters plenty of adventures on the road.

I liked this movie. This has a little bit less action than All About the Benjamin's but the comedy definitely makes up for it. I think Cube and Hart worked well together, with Hart playing the comic relief and Cube playing the serious role. I thought it was kinda cool that lines from some of Ice Cubes songs were woven into the script (one famous song from his Predator album...I'm sure you other Cube fans will know it when you hear it). Also, watch out for the cameos of other famous celebrities/artists! I don't know why this movie was panned by film critics, but if you are looking for an cop action comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, then this is one movie to watch.

The gag reel version is three minutes of outtakes which are shown after the ending credits. Its nothing like an alternate ending so you're not missing out on much. And if you're insistent on watching the gag reel you might as well just buy the blu-ray. I'd give this movie a 4.5, but am rounding up to a 5 because I'm a huge Cube fan and I love movies like this.",1397520000,,1597,4.410169491525424

6242076,4,B00HX0KIAM,"Ride Along is a comedy which stars Ice Cube, Kevin Hart, John Leguizamo, Bryan Callen, Tika Sumpter and Laurence Fishburne.  The film was directed by Tim Story (Think Like a Man) and written by Greg Coolidge, Jason Mantzoukas (The League), Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi.  The story is pretty simple; it follows a security guard Ben (Kevin Hart) who must prove himself to his girlfriend's brother, top cop James (Ice Cube).  Ben rides along with James on a 24-hour patrol of Atlanta.

I found this film very funny and when Kevin Hart was allowed within the script there were some pretty heartfelt moments.  I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to others.

6242077,3,B00HX0KIAM,"""Maybe this guys alright, he just wants into the family."" Ben Barber (Hart) is a security guard with aspirations of becoming a real cop. His girlfriends brother James Payton (Cube) is a real cop but isn't impressed with Ben and thinks she can do better. When she convinces James to take Ben out on a ride along with him to get to know him better Ben is excited, James has other ideas though. What starts off as a way for James to get rid of Ben turns serious when real trouble finds them. I am a fan of the buddy cop genre but really since Lethal weapon it seems that every movie like that tries to copy it. This one is a little different, it tries to copy every buddy cop movie ever. I did think the movie was funny in some parts and I am glad I watched it but it was overly generic to the point of almost being a spoof. I think the big problem I had with this is that it tried way to hard to be funny and some of the comedy came off as being forced. Kevin Hart is a funny guy but he seemed to be trying to hard in this movie. There was really no chemistry between the two and that hurt the movie and the comedy. Overall, funny in parts but tried to hard to get laughs and the movie felt very forced. I give this a B-.",1397433600,,1219,3.9392712550607287

The chemistry between the two was good but seemed to run out of steam towards the end. A good one time to watch movie. No real high repeat value for me.,1397433600,,264,4.0
6242081,5,B00HX0KIAM,This one was pretty good.  I liked it.  Lots of action.  Good that it is a rental on amazon prime.  Didn't do to well in the theaters however entertaining anyway.  So if you get a chance it was a pretty good flick.  Ending is better than the beginning.,1397347200,,252,4.145833333333333

6242083,4,B00HX0KIAM,Very surprised about this comedy. Not a fan of Kevin Hart but he was funny in this movie.  Give it a watch.,1397260800,,107,3.8636363636363638
6242084,1,B00HX0KIAM,"Blah blah black joke blah blah blah. Kevin heart is as clich as ever, high voice and short stature. As one could assume ice cube is a tough cop who frequently wrinkles his nose and forehead at ""wacky antics"". Insert other buddy cop movie title.",1397174400,5,244,4.444444444444445
6242085,5,B00HX0KIAM,Was a great and funny movie if you like action and comedy this would be great for you. AAA +++,1397174400,8,94,3.75
6242086,5,B00HX0KIAM,It was a great movie. It was also really funny. Kevin Hart is just a good comedy actor and will make you laugh over the things he brings to this movie. Ice Cube is also good in this movie. They worked well together to make a movie I like to watch and get a good laugh.,1397174400,,268,3.8035714285714284
6242087,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Angela (Tika Sumpter) wants to marry Ben (Kevin Hart), but her brother, James (Ice Cube), is against it. James is a police officer. To prove himself worthy of James' sister, Ben agrees to go on a ride along.

I watched this movie months ago when it was in theaters. Ride Along has a lot of crude humor I did not care for, but there are parts that gave me a good belly laugh. Kevin Hart makes common sense funny.",1397088000,7,411,4.2025316455696204

6242089,5,B00HX0KIAM,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, I was expecting a little more regarding the premise, none the less the actors were great. Somehow it seemed thrown togther as far as the plot.",1397001600,,186,4.5
6242090,5,B00HX0KIAM,Kevin hart was funny from to start to finish.  Laughed through out the movie.  Good mixture of action and comedy.,1396828800,,113,4.6
6242091,5,B00HX0KIAM,Great movie! Couldn't stop laughing! One word to sum this movie up is HILARIOUS!!! I could watch it over and over again!!!,1396828800,3,122,4.590909090909091
6242092,1,B00HX0KIAM,I did not like this movie at all it started very predictable and did not take any chances or do anything interesting with the story line. I wanted a little more story and comedy mabey some twist of some kind. I wasted my money and brought this on digital copy wish I would have just rented it and saved some dough. My suggestion is to save your money and don't buy just rent it.,1396828800,3,378,4.121621621621622
6242093,3,B00HX0KIAM,This was a good way to kill a few hours but it wasn't a great movie.  I was expecting something closer to Rush Hour type humor.,1396828800,,127,3.8846153846153846
6242094,5,B00HX0KIAM,Very funny movie. Ice cube and Kevin hart make a great team. The bad guys were a little predictable though,1396828800,,106,4.35
6242095,4,B00HX0KIAM,Iet me just start off by saying It takes alot to make me laugh I just don't laugh for any little thing or joke but for this movie I was laughing my ass off Kevin Hart is the best comedian of our generation he definitely did his thing,1396828800,,233,3.875
6242096,5,B00HX0KIAM,"This is a feel-good-move. Kevin Hart is excellent, he reminds me so much of steve Carell, it is their facial expressions and mannerisms that's so funny.

You should definitely watch this, better time spent than watching some of those crazy reality shows.",1396828800,,254,5.0476190476190474
6242097,4,B00HX0KIAM,Enjoyed movie thought Kevin Hart was funny.  Would recommmend it if you enjoy a good comedy made me laugh through out the movie.,1396828800,,128,4.565217391304348
6242098,5,B00HX0KIAM,"Ice Cube the cop is just as cool as Ice Cube ""The Bail Bondsman"". Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart, funny and more funny. If your looking for a entertaining fun-filled ride, you should enjoy this movie.",1396656000,30,194,4.416666666666667
6242099,3,B00HX0KIAM,"The trailer was better then the movie itself. There were several funny moments, but a few ones. Just the same Hollywood is used to create movies, everything hovers around a one stupid thing.",1396656000,,190,4.787878787878788
6242100,5,B00HX0KIAM,"Great movie, lots of laughs, and a little bit of serious. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are hilarious together. Although the movie is by far a comedy, it has a great plot and ends well. ""Black Hammer!""",1396569600,,195,4.297297297297297
6242101,5,B00HX0KIAM,"Funny as can be!
Kevin Hart does a really good job playing the part. More movies should be like this.",1396569600,,101,4.1
6242102,4,B00HX0KIAM,I love Kevin Hart... so I am probably a little biased. This movie is just a typical comedy. No big unexpected plot twists or anything like that - just a fun movie to watch if you want a good laugh.,1396396800,,197,3.95
6242103,5,B00HX0KIAM,Love this movie! anything with Kevin Hart and ice cube will make your day turn better. Definitely will be buying the movie again.,1396396800,,129,4.6521739130434785

6242105,1,B00HX0KIAM,"So this is a remake of the Sandra Bullock movie with Melissa McCarthy called The Heat. In addition, its a remake of the Bruce Willis/Tracy Morgan film called Cop Out. Oh, and its a remake of the Marky Mark movie with Will Ferrell. Okso you are seeing a trend here with a good cop slash lazy-loose cop film. This film is not breaking new ground and I feel it will only appeal to diehard Kevin Hart fans. I am a fan of good comedy, but this film was downright painful to watch in the movie theater. It truly was. I looked at my watch so many times to see when this thing would end. Kevin is straight up annoying and the sound of his nasal voice drives me up a wall. Certain comedians talents just don't translate well on screen. This is a perfect example of one of them. Stir clear of this film.",1396310400,5,793,4.1558441558441555
6242106,3,B00HX0KIAM,"Ice Cube is cool as detective James Payton, but its pseudo partner Ben Barber, played by Kevin Hart, who steals the show. Hes funnier here as an actor than he is as a stand-up (on-stage) comedian; so in a movie with such a hackneyed plot, the jokes are the driving force. This is essentially a loose parody of Training Day, a fact the script is just clever enough to acknowledge.

6242107,4,B00HX0KIAM,"Director Tim Story (""Think Like a Man"") brings us a crowd pleaser that had the screening audience laughing from the first frame. Of course that is partly due to the great popularity of fast-talking Kevin Hart, but this silly odd-couple story is fun. Any self-respecting police department would NEVER allow the sorts of capers we see, but what's a few plot holes between friends? It certainly didn't handicap writers Greg Coolidge (""Baby Mama"") and Jason Mantzoukas (Lots of TV) as they pile laugh upon laugh while we happily suspend disbelief and wait for the happy ending.

Even through our hero is steadily employed as a security guard, he really, REALLY wants to be an Atlanta police officer like his finance's brother James. He feels prepared: after all, he has played a cop in countless video games. There are three important things in his life: Being a cop, those video games and his gorgeous fianc&eacute;e Angela.

We watch:
  * Kevin Hart (""Grudge Match"") is our hero Ben, who has finagled a ride in a cop car with his potential brother-in-law to prove he is worthy to marry into the family. (Every legitimate PD in the country is shaking its collective head.)
  * Tika Sumpter (""Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas"") plays our hero's lovely sweetheart, Angela. This patient gal seems to find his immature ADHD-type personality appealing.
  * Ice Cube (""21 Jump Street"") brings us James, a no-nonsense cop who has trust issues, particularly with this haywire fruitcake his sister Angela has unaccountably fallen for.
  * Bruce McGill (""Lincoln"") will always convince ME that he is a tough but fair police captain who is running out of patience: Detective James is highly effective, but his unorthodox methods are difficult to justify.

Of course we have other cops who provide backup, plus a surprise mystery guest whom I won't divulge because he is uncredited, so that would be a spoiler.

This is PG-13, so expect mild profanity, no nudity, no sweaty bodies, some vehicular mayhem, some dandy blowie uppie stuff and a LOT of gunfire! By the time Ben gets his hands on a loaded gun, I was ready to slap him! I've been around guns all my life and have never see such careless mishandling! I know, I know, it's a comedy, but....

Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can broadcast a notice for my JayFlix.net folks.",1392681600,,2335,4.8075
