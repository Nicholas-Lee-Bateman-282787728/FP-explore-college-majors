2824923,5,B000PKG7ES,"I purchased this title for my kids because it includes so many of their favorite stories, including ""But I Am an Alligator"" and ""Snow is My Favorite and My Best"".  The writing and voice acting for this program is so much better than most kids' TV shows.  It's so good that it even makes it pleasant for parents to watch along with their little ones!",1307404800,,349,4.3538461538461535
2824924,5,B000PKG7ES,"My daughter is 8 and we've been watching C&L since ""the beginning"".  They're terrific, all the way around, and the lessons are fantastic.  I pray they keep up the great work!",1267488000,,174,4.580645161290323

2824926,5,B000PKG7ES,I began watching Charlie and Lola with my children on television. I was just thrilled when I found out that I could purchase them on DVD.  These little shows have been a great teaching tool for me because I have a son and a daughter.  I use Charlie and Lola as an example of how brothers and sisters should treat each other.  I absolutely love these DVDs.,1209168000,,355,4.268656716417911
2824927,5,B000PKG7ES,Charlie and Lola are great as usual. My 6 and 9 year old granddaughters love watching this dvd. It has very real situations in a sweet and comical take. The girls watch it in my car on the way to and from school. The person who comes up with all of the situations must have kids of their own. I look forward to all of their dvds.,1202860800,,329,3.925373134328358
2824928,5,B000PKG7ES,"Charlie and Lola series are the type you wouldn't mind your child(ren) watching over and over.  Brings back the meaning of GOOD cartoons, unlike 'some' of the modern cartoons that you dare not allow your child(ren) to watch. My 5 year old and I are all about Charlie and Lola. She watches them for entertainment, while I watch them with her to relax. Gives me a peace of mind to know there's no adult content of any sort.  We have all 5 volumes and looking foward to getting volume 6 - which am sure will make an ECELLENT christmas gift for my daughter/any child for that matter.  It helps that almost half our family are British, so they help us add to our collection by sending Charlie and Lola collectables (books, stickers, etc) - and YES :-) I highly recommend them all (videos, books, etc). You can also catch the 30 min shows on the Disney Channel every Saturday morning.",1194998400,3,878,4.475
2824929,5,B000PKG7ES,"We were just doing some chores while our 3 year old daughter watched the Disney Channel, and Charlie and Lola came on.  We are impressed!  First, for full disclosure, my wife and I are just addicted to british accents.  Our favorite show is the BBC Office and we watch it annually so as to honor its genius.  So when we heard these charming children with such charming accents - it was a welcome change from the annoying screamy voices of almost every other cartoon.  If you've ever heard Dora and Carmen you know about kids screaming voices - just thinking of those voices gives me a headache.  Second, I am personally bewildered at how much cartoons these days have underlying themes of being over the top bizarre, politically correct, or are just down right disturbing.  One second my daughter will be watching a somewhat normal cartoon, and then something like Dexter's Laboratory will come on and I don't think she needs to see such weird crap.  I think that the renowned cartoon Ren & Stimpy has worked its way into a lot of cartoons, and while I like R & S plenty, I think was meant as an adult cartoon, and meant to shock.  Our favorite program for our daughter so far has been Blues Clues (the Steve years, sorry Jon) because it is so respectful and interactive.  But we are going to order some Charlie and Lola too - I can hardly wait to hear their quaint kiddy accents again.",1194393600,3,1386,4.48605577689243
2824930,5,B000PKG7ES,"Charlie and Lola, Vol. 5 does not disappoint. My two-year-old daughter loves this dvd just as much as all the rest. I especially love how watching Charlie and Lola in the car keeps her nice and calm on long trips!",1189296000,,213,4.35

2824941,5,B000PKG7ES,The kids love watching Charlie and Lola for some reason and Amazon seems to be the place where I can get the series at a reasonable price.
