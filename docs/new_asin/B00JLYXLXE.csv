8652294,1,B00JLYXLXE,"Cheap, boring found footage film. The leads are so obnoxious and annoying you can't wait for them to die. The few FX shown are cheap and laughable. The plot is tired and unoriginal and has been done much better in dozens of other movies. Don't waste your time.",1420156800,,260,4.4375

The intro credits were pretty damn cool. :)  That aside... I am a huge fan of found footage, microbudget horror c-movies. That said, I have seen more than a hundred of them in the last couple years. The acting was actually pretty decent, and the footage believable and edited in an appropriately amateurish way, just as you'd expect (and want) from this genre. One major problem with most of these films has been the directors' (using the plural here, as I've seen it in way too many films) is the use of a majority of the beginning of the movie on pointless footage. Where a good director might use that as a ""slow build"" for suspense, or even for the foundation of the story, too many new directors just include footage that is nothing but wasted time. This film - if you stick with it - does a decent job of using this time to do both. I was quite close to throwing in the towel after the first 15 minutes, but then I was pleasantly surprised... I found I was able to suspend disbelief and ""buy"" into the story, owing to the previously mentioned factors. The plot summary does a good job of describing the storyline, and I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say this was definitely worth the price of admission for a video in this genre. it's not ""scary"" in the traditional sense (no scares at all) - but more of a psychological horror story.",1417651200,,1362,4.362204724409449

8652297,4,B00JLYXLXE,"This is an independent horror flick, filmed in the found footage tradition of the handheld cam. It's based around a trio of lowlifes who decide to commit a home invasion, unfortunately for them they chose the wrong house to invade. The film has a genuinely gritty feel to it that can only be captured with indie films. The characters feel believable, they may be a bit over the top, but it's par for the course. You put anyone on camera and they act over the top, put a maniac on tape and watch hell unleashed. The film also has it's share of comic relief, though twisted it may be. It comes across to me as an homage to old grindhouse flicks, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Last House On the Left. Well worth a viewing.",1413072000,,724,4.37037037037037
8652298,5,B00JLYXLXE,"A nice little Indie horror flick. I personally prefer these kinds of movies over the big-budget crap they put out now, reminds me of what the genre used to be. Definitely some funny moments from the ""burglars"" and when they have the the tables turned on them.",1411516800,,259,4.531914893617022
