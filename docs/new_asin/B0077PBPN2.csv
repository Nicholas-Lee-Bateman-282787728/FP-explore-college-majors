8512122,5,B0077PBPN2,"Here's something different: autopsies of a lion and a tiger that died in a London zoo reveal that lions and tigers are virtually the same under the skin and can't be told apart, even by an expert, without their pajamas. They also give a nice view of a lion's penis and testicles. They even compare the dead lion's voice box to a dead human's, and blow air through it to make a dead lion roar. Not your usual nature show. Stretching the lion's intestines across the floor, the vets demonstrate how they're different from an elephant's guts, which spill out like something from a dump truck. I found this all very interesting indeed, as I've gotten tired of the typical nature show of big animals eating smaller ones. They also show a liger (a cross between a lion and a tiger) a fairly goofy looking beast, but it does demonstrate how close these big cats are genetically. The lion and tiger differ sociologically, it would seem, more than anatomically -- tigers being solitary and lions living in large family groups. I would actually watch this one twice.",1412380800,,1056,4.652406417112299
8512123,4,B0077PBPN2,"Fascinating dissection video, that adults and mature kids who are interested in such things will truly enjoy. My high school students were mesmerized at the tie-in between the anatomy of the lion's larynx and its physiology: the roar. Re-creating that roar with the larynx alone,  ""ex corpore"" , was an unforgettable sound and sight.",1403222400,,333,5.166666666666667
