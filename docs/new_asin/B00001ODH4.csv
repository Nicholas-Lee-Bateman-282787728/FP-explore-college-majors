1245957,5,B00001ODH4,"This little B movie from 1941 has been on my `watch list' for some time, and I wish I had seen it sooner. Made before the day `that will live in infamy' that is December 7th 1941 and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this clearly wanted the world to know that Hitler and co were evil.

Eric Franklen is a chemist in Nazi Germany and is working with the `underground' he is the voice of their radio broadcasts where they tell the German people the truth about the war - the stuff that the censors won't allow. Then his brother returns from the front having lost an arm - he though is a loyal party member and despite the ties of fraternity when it comes to politics they are diametrically opposed. Enter the shared acquaintance of a woman who is also an underground member, and her influence will change things irrevocably.

We have the Nazi's torturing, being vile and all dressed in their Hugo Boss finery and they all have German sounding accents (most of the time). This is done in true Warner Bros. style with a brilliantly paced script, great use of lighting, perfect editing and a cast that could not put a foot wrong. Add to that the actual story and you have a nigh on brilliant piece of film making.

The actual quality of the print does leave a bit to be desired and this could do with a well earned makeover. Plus there are issues around some of the details and factual accuracy - but this was never meant to be a history lesson; it was a rallying call to stand up to fascists and as such should be applauded. It will still have you on the edge of your seat even to this day and that takes some doing. If you have missed this then do yourself a massive favour and get to see it.",1425168000,,1692,4.264797507788162
1245958,4,B00001ODH4,"PLOT: Anti Nazi movement from inside Germany~ VERY Good.

1941~ two brothers have opposing views of the Nazi Rgime. One brother has returned missing one arm and has battled in Russia for the Fatherland. He shows his 'devotion' to the Nazi cause in every way. The other brother is part of an ""UNDERGROUND"" anti Nazi movement with in Germany. They have a anti Nazi Radio and pass anti Nazi propaganda pamphlets. This starts as the SECRET anti Nazi group using their secret radio transmit views to Germany and the Gestapo is hot on their heels. They make a narrow escape but the brothers are both interested in the same girl, LOVELY violin player (KAAREN VERNE) who aids the underground movement. This is very good we see how a family is tore apart in opposing views. The fun is watching a double agent inside the Gestapo Headquarters who ""helps the cause"" by tipping off the Underground. This is a very good movie. Holds the interest. Jeffrey Lynn is the Pro Nazi brother and Philip Door is the anti Nazi brother, and LOVELY KAAREN VERNE never disappoints. and  one of MY favorite Nazis is Martin Kosleck who pulls off the Nazi sneaky looks perfect every time.
4 STARS~",1425081600,,1167,4.660194174757281

1245963,5,B00001ODH4,"a bit of personal background here: long ago, when tv was watchable,  wor (channel 9) in new york city ran something called ""the million dollar movie"".  twice a day, every day for a week, they showed the same film over and over and over again.  it might seem bizarre, but compare it to nowadays where we get nbc repeating reality shows from 3 days before as encore events.  via m$m, i got to know well irene dunne in ""i remember mama""; my friend bugsy still revels in memories of ""tales of hoffman""; and other friends in our generous age range have shared fond recollections.  that said, one of the movies i came to know (and love) was a film called ""underground"": a tale of two brothers in nazi germany, one in the resistance and the other in hitlers army.  i was always wary about revisiting this film many years later; other movies that impressed me as a youngster have not held up to my memory.  but i recently ventured to watch ""underground"" for the first time in somewhere twixt 30 and 40 years.  guess what?  this is a great movie!  perfectly acted and scripted, and with a ""tale of two cities""-inspired final moment as we realize (thru the message that only his to-be-executed brother can grasp) that the struggle against the fascists will be carried forward.  what i did not understand as a little kid, of course, is that this movie was made in 1941, BEFORE america had entered the war, and when sentiment in this country still allowed for loads of hitler sympathizers.  director vincent sherman, later a victim of the blacklist, turned a B movie programmer into a brilliant piece of agitprop.  was this as good a movie as i remember?  oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.",1181433600,,1667,4.531772575250836

1245965,5,B00001ODH4,"I saw this film on TV when I was a child.  It made such an impression on me that I have searched for it for years, since VHS and then DVDs became widely available.
While it may not have the big names of other war movies, this one is a true morality tale.  It grabs you by the gut and shows how people can be misled into following evil-doers, but it also points out that they can see the light, and regain their humanity.
I defy anyone with an ounce of compassion to view this film's final scene without shedding a tear.  I plan to show it to my children, because it is rare that you see such a vivid dislay of both the worst and the best that people have to offer in one film.  I highly recommend it.",1042070400,18,700,3.9785714285714286
1245966,4,B00001ODH4,"Underground is a film that is hardly known today, perhaps because it lacks any major stars.  It's basically a B-movie cast in a film that is not produced to be just a programmer.  Set during the early days of World War Two, it features Jeffrey Lynn and Philip Dorn as German brothers involved on opposites of the conflict.  Dorn is a leader of the underground movement, while Lynn is a soldier fiercely loyal to the Fuhrer.  Dorn's underground members send out leaflets denouncing the Nazis, but more effectively, they broadcast an outlawed radio program that the Nazis want desperately to stop.  When Lynn falls in love with Kaaren Verne, another underground member, things get even more complicated.  The performers are all quite good (including Martin Kosleck as one of those detestable Nazis portrayed in WWII films), and director Victor Sherman, an accomplished director, tells the story very effectively.  It moves along well, builds up excellent suspense, and develops a lot of sympathy for its characters and their cause.  This is a great film to ""discover"", and I hope that on video, it will become more well known.  It deserves the attention.",1016150400,12,1152,4.989528795811518

7914597,5,B00001ODH4,I love this movie. Always have. Saw it years ago.the ending is v. Stirring. Yes i know it is a simplified  and romantic story and nothing like what it must have been like to live in a fear-filled late 1930s nazi Germany..and the baddies are so bad. A con to this movie is that the baddies are caricatures in the plot whilst the good guys are either a little dimwitted or shining knights - no gray here but remember the times and as a propaganda movie it delivered. I always had a soft spot for Philip Dorn. Very underrated actor. So i will see it periodically.  Glad i have it.,1456272000,,577,4.236363636363636
