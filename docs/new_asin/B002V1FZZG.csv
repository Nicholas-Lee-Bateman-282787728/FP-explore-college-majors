8381742,5,B002V1FZZG,"I have been doing these two workouts for years with the VHS tapes and am so glad to see them out in DVD now. The movements are graceful and flowing, with cool names like ""parting the wild horse's mane,"" ""throwing the pearl,"" and ""soaring eagle,"" set to what I describe as ""tribal"" music. I get a good workout for both my body and my mind, and my spirit feels good at the end, too! As always, Petra cues elegantly and exactly, and offers modifications for those of us who need them. Give it a try!",1359417600,7,496,4.231578947368421
