7029258,4,B00U6QUSVE,"This is a Brit crime thriller set on the mean streets of East London! Montana is a young boy working as a drug runner for a gang of criminals headed up by some rather unpleasant Bosnian called Lazarus. The film opens with scenes of war crimes from the war in Bosnia in 1995 where we meet Dimitrijie (Lars Mikkelsen - `Sherlock' TV series and `Flame and Citron'). He has a history and is a sort of ex assassin, but we need the back story to contextualise what will take place in present day London.

Soon their paths cross and they find out that they have something in common - that is revenge. This will involve the drugs gang, some well corrupt police and a load of guns as well as some full on Ninja training.

This has elements of `Leon' and a `Rocky' montage too - which actually works. Some of the antics require a leap of faith to believe, but this is actually so well made, edited, filmed and acted that you just forgive all failings - even the glaring plot holes a coupe of times. Set in some of the less appealing parts of London it has the feel of authenticity where it needs it. Mikkelsen is just excellent but a special mention has to go to uber bad cop Brad Moore playing Phelps. He seems to get some of the best one liners and has a line in potty mouth greetings that would shock a docker or even a police person.

There is plenty of violence and blood shed and yes the story is a bit far fetched but this can also be moving in places and it has a dnouement that brings everything back to earth; this film does not hang about and even at 100 odd minutes it still felt much shorter - seriously recommended.",1444003200,,1619,4.216129032258064

7029260,4,B00U6QUSVE,A great action Karate Kid meets The Professional kind of Indie film!  Loved it!,1443744000,,79,4.642857142857143
7029261,4,B00U6QUSVE,"While I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first heard about Montana, I ended up really enjoying the plot and the especially the soundtrack. While the plot was thrilling enough to me as is, I thought the soundtrack added an extra level of energy to the movie which ended up being one of my favorite things about it. One thing I wasn't expecting was the mix of emotions I felt throughout the movie; from nostalgia coming from a Karate Kid-esque wax-on, wax-off scene, to the high action drug lord scenes, to even some really touching moments as well, all of which I really liked. The variety of emotions keep me entertained throughout the film and is another reason why I would say Montana is definitely worth the watch.",1443571200,,724,4.576923076923077
7029262,4,B00U6QUSVE,"I was really in the mood for an England-based action movie since its going to be a while before the next James Bond movie. Then I found Montana, which was great. It wasn't too heavy and never got too dark. It was about a boy named Montana who is part of a drug ring. Then he gets trained by a former Bosnian soldier to become a vigilante in one of the best training montages Ive seen in a while. This movie was not too heavy. It was a great action movie that reminded me of a cross between Zorro and The Karate Kid. I really enjoyed the characters and the quick pace of this movie.",1443139200,,581,4.060869565217391
7029263,4,B00U6QUSVE,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that new kid on the block, McKell David, shines as the title role in Montana. Director Mo Ali guided the youngster to make some great acting choices throughout the film ranging from introspective emotion to his fascination with Jess. The film covers a lot of ground, from drug lords to young love to intense fight scenes. The London setting created a freshness that is often missing in the action movie genre. I recently was able to see this film and recommend it to anyone; now that offered on demand everywhere.",1443052800,,552,4.760416666666667
7029264,5,B00U6QUSVE,Really enjoyed the wild ride delivered by MONTANA.  Strong performances by some recognizable names & faces including Michelle Fairley from GAME OF THRONES and Lars Mikkelsen from HOUSE OF CARDS as well as newcomer McKell David in this tale of revenge & unlikely friendship.  Excellent direction and great action sequences throughout.  Absolutely worth a look!,1442275200,4,359,5.490909090909091
7029265,4,B00U6QUSVE,"A very solid and enjoyable installment of 'The Way Of The Warrior'.

Can't say for certain when this became a movie staple, but I almost instantly go to two western classics. ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannie-Caulder/dp/B003J216KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannie Caulder</a>"" with Robert Culp and Raquel Welch at her most beautiful; and the sublime Steve McQueen performance in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nevada-Smith/dp/B00AEFYPHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nevada Smith</a>' with venerable character actor Brian Keith as his unplanned warrior guide. Although it's fair to say that many movies about combat and the martial arts certainly qualify as well.

Tells the story of Montana, a teen orphan trying to survive growing up in a harsh world. And Dimitrije, the former Serbian army commando now hunting down ""bad men"" to atone for past sins.

A balaclava short of a being a ninja, Dimitrije is the sharp end of Death's scythe. His cloak of invisibility is two-fold: First, he's utterly forgettable. And second, he's completely non-threatening. One would find a bank teller more menacing. Looking nothing more than a bum, his targets never see it coming until it's way too late.

Moving from township to township, he quietly disposes of the drug dealers, the pimps, and other pariah; ridding society of its worst scumbags. He's chosen to be the garbage disposal and we should be thankful that he's on our side. Having recently relocated to a new neighborhood, his first mission is always intelligence gathering - both figuratively and literally scoping out the scene.

That's when he notices the youngster hauling cocaine.

But he's not the only one watching.

Soon, a rival gang targets the young man for a robbery. Outnumbered and outmatched, Montana loses his parcel. And that's about as bad as it gets. Apologies won't cut it for his brutal employer. There is zero tolerance for failure - he'll have to pay with his life.

Easier said than done. Nimble and super quick, he's only wounded. Suddenly, a dark figure appears and Montana's world drifts toward the blackness.

When he awakes - he's amazed to be able to awake at all. His wound has been seen to and bandaged. Poking around his new surroundings, he checks out the quiet lair of his mysterious savior. A savior who he finds working out - hard muscles and sharp martial art moves hidden under the bulky facade of homelessness reveals the warrior beneath.

Not wanting to punish a teenager whom he recognizes as a misled innocent, Dimitrije reaches out and tries to steer Montana into a new direction. Why? He explains that he had a son who would be about his age had he lived; and he wouldn't allow his son to become a victim of thugs.

The cagey veteran agrees to teach him The Path.

Movie Recommendations:

- Not quite the same vein as this movie as it falls into the black comedy genre, but utilizing a similar narrative, check out '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Kill-Me/dp/B00DEYR3PE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Kill Me</a>' with Tea Leone and the always enjoyable Sir Ben Kingsley in a reinvigorating career role.

- And in a much, much darker film with knifes instead of guns - '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Grande-Art/dp/B0053C8Q3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Grande Art</a>' with Peter Coyote and the always amazing Tchky Karyo. The film also goes by the alternate titles 'Exposure' and 'The Knife'.

Personal Note:

- Lars Mikkelsen is one of my favorite European actors. An artist who always delivers powerful understated performances that fascinate and intrigue.",1426636800,3,3718,5.577264653641207
7029266,3,B00U6QUSVE,"Dimitrije (Lars Mikkelsen) is a Serbian assassin who hates corruption. After the killing of his family, he spends the next few decades going after the killer and going vigilante all over the Serbian mafia across Europe. His quest has taken him to London.

Montana (McKell David) is a delivery boy for the London Serbian mob which has dirty cops to help them. Circumstances lead to 14 year old Montana to become a protg for Dimitrjie as they team up to take down the bad guys and enact revenge.

Yes, another vigilante film. Not as pathetic as ""Harry Brown"" but it could have used Vinnie Jones or Simon Phillips. It is a watchable film, and you pretty much know what is going to happen. Characters are stereotypes. A me-too vigilante film.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Dancer in pasties.",1425513600,6,791,4.717391304347826

7029277,3,B00U6QUSVE,"This film would be a good film to watch when I've grown tired of all the cinema action blockbusters. The film was a good way to use about 2 hours. It's about a young man who finds himself in a tragic lifestyle with no father figure to look forward to. To his luck, he is rescued when he was betrayed by his ""friends"". The film was action packed, though a little exaggerated at times. Also, I didn't like how the title was misleading. From the beginning, I thought the movie was going to be filmed in Montana or something else related to the state.

I wouldn't go out of my way to watch the film, but if it happens to be on TV I would probably watch it.",1447632000,,652,4.09375

I originally wanted to see Montana because of the action aspect, but as I watched it I realized that it has a deeper meaning hidden under all the guns and explosions.
