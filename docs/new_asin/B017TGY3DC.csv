7533988,5,B017TGY3DC,I didn't know that this dvd is supposed to be for people who are beginning with Buti Yoga. I still like it though.,1452902400,7,114,4.0
7533989,5,B017TGY3DC,"Ever since I tried Bizzie Golds first Buti yoga series, Transformation, I have been hooked on Buti yoga.

This gem of a DVD has several workouts:

* 30 minute Dynamic Flow
* 60 Minute Dynamic Flow
* Upper Body Sculpt
* Lower Body Sculpt
* Ab Sculpt.

There is also an introductory section on some of the moves.  This is especially helpful for the ab work.  Its hard to get the spiral moves that are Bizzies trademark so its good to have a detailed breakdown of these moves.

Each of the sculpting sections targets a different part of the body.  For each workout, you do 6 different exercises, 40 seconds of work with 20 seconds of stretching.  You repeat the workout 4 times.  Let me tell you, your heart rate gets up there!

The workouts have just Bizzie working out in a warehouse type setting.  The set is not quite as dark as the set for Shakti Sweat series.  The walls are brick and the floor is concrete.

Why I love this series:

* After doing one of these workouts, I feel relaxed, yet energized.  Its as though I can really feel that kundalini energy flowing through my body.

* The music is cool.  There are many different songs and they blend perfectly with the moves.  The music is very different than that of other workouts.

* Both Dynamic Flow workouts feel very different.  Its amazing that Miss Bizzie can come up with so many different moves and flows so you don't feel like you are repeating a workout.

If you are looking for some new and fun yoga workouts, you will enjoy these.

*I bought these workouts directly from the Buti yoga site, right when they first came out.",1449100800,17,1591,4.413793103448276
8740620,4,B017TGY3DC,"Love this workout! I don't get bored but some of the moves are a little difficult for me. The video is shot very poorly, its hard to hear her at times and the music will just stop in the middle of a set so its hard to stay focused and you have to constantly look up to make sure she didn't move on to a different move and you just didn't hear her.",1521849600,,347,3.767123287671233
8740621,2,B017TGY3DC,EH. I regularly practice yoga but still consider myself to be a beginner. Ive done all sorts of yoga so I am open to many different flavors and was excited to try this however I do not think that this is good for beginners. I think the moves are poorly explained which leads to not engaging the right muscles or could even lead to injury especially considering the fast pace of movements. There is definitely room for improvement with this DVD. There needs to be a video or two for actual beginners. Yikes.,1520812800,3,506,4.451612903225806

8740623,5,B017TGY3DC,"I started Buti with the original dvd- transformation series. I had never done yoga. The original kicked my butt at first but I did it! I had never completed a work out dvd before. I fell in love with Buti. I used that one for months until I received this one as a gift. I loved it! Its slower and really helps you prepare for the harder moves to come in the other dvd sets. It helped me connect more with what I was doing and learn to focus and center myself. I used this one intermediately with the older one until I could get the next set. If you're a new to the Buti practice and cant afford the subscription, use this one. Even when I am in shape to do the more advanced ones, there is something about coming home after a hard long day at work and doing these slower more peaceful workouts. Also, if you happen to fall off the workout wagon for the holidays, this is the best way to stretch and get back in it! This workout even if for beginners is super effective.",1514592000,3,969,4.105263157894737
8740624,3,B017TGY3DC,"First of all, this girl mumbles. So it is like Sylvester the Cat's yoga instructional. That might be all anyone needs to know.

The cuing is terrible (left, now your other left, oh the right, what), so forget about keeping up and until you learn the routine, be happy to just go along. After you learn the routine, you'll be happy because then you will know when to pause the playback & work on the other side you now know she will never get back to during the video.

If you want to modify anything, you are going to have to know enough yoga to be able to do it yourself because she isn't telling you.  Speaking broadly, Buti is a vanity project, not unlike Bikram's yoga: useful to a point, but mostly a cash-cow, super-full of the creator's rigid, inflexible, grandiose mumbo-jumbo.

There is an instructional portion in the video where, again, mumbling, and also the instructions are not really clear at all, it's like, ""Oh, you know, like this, see?""  Not really, too bad.

I have for a long time been doing her workouts all online (youtube/vimeo) from the last five years or whatever that are really fun and well-paced and more simple (for example, she has in this workout ""created"" something she calls ""Dancing Abs"" which looks pretty but due to her bad cuing is worthless).  I know she has a girl working with her now who has a dance background & I wish that woman would be the more forward face of the breakdowns & instruction because she probably has a useful vocabulary.

Basically it's like no one watched the footage before they pressed it & sold it. Or maybe it was watched & no one cared abt the production/performance errors. For the price of this DVD, it's too bad it is garbage. All the problems it has should be something hilarious from a livecast, not anything you pay for & try to use on the regular.",1507852800,37,1821,4.480362537764351
8740625,4,B017TGY3DC,"So as someone new to Buti and yoga in general, This is pretty intense. I bought this with two other buti yoga dvds as a bundle on the Buti website since they were on sale.  I'm really enjoying it so far, even though I can only get through about 15 minutes of it. I do wish that for each transition the camera was facing Bizzie, versus being a side view because as a beginner I get a bit confused. I do feel this is increasing my flexibility and getting my sweat on.

I initially bought it as something to do on my ""off"" days from working out but I think it may be best combined with my workouts. Ordering from the website I did get an included 30 day workout schedule, I don't think that comes with the DVD alone. But I would call the high intensity yoga. If your into HIIT workouts, and always stayed away from yoga thinking it was too boring. This is for you!",1506556800,11,861,4.119047619047619
8740626,1,B017TGY3DC,DVD wouldn't play- they won't even return calls. Terrible customer service. WAsted money,1504569600,4,88,5.846153846153846
8740627,5,B017TGY3DC,Super fun and a great workout. Warning: you could be come addicted. ;),1504396800,,70,4.461538461538462
8740628,3,B017TGY3DC,"Um, wow.  So, on my part I should have looked into Buti Yoga better first.  While I see my trainer twice a week, do yoga twice a week, and do cardio twice a week . . . this type of workout is INTENSE.  You need to be REALLY conditioned to keep up.

With that that said, I don't think that the simple poses before prepare you (especially if you hadn't done a lot of yoga before) and you really only get a few workouts without many modifications for beginners.  You get one 30 minute, one 60 minute, an upper, lower, and ab workout that are all 5 minutes.  I'm all about trying new things, but for the price tag on this DVD I'm pretty disappointed.

I'd give it lower, but I feel it was my fault for not having checked into the type of workout more beforehand, but the dvd itself isn't great with it's lack of modifications, intensity, and price.",1488153600,22,844,4.204968944099379
8740629,5,B017TGY3DC,This is the perfect DVD for beginning buti. I couldn't get through the current ones but I can start with this. I love it! I feel energized after just a few minutes.,1473120000,10,164,4.15625
