1810003,5,B00007G1WT,"Simply put, this was the special that hooked me on George Carlin...and I only saw it by complete accident.  Or should I say heard it.  The first contact I had with a Carlin special came on a winter night when the power went out.  When it finally came back on the TV came back automatically but, before I could fire up the VCR, I began hearnig some stand-up.  HBO, which we didn't get at the time, turned out to be on the same channel that my TV's default channel was and HBO was somehow coming in strong on audio that night.  Too lazy to get up I began listening and never turned it off.  Only at the end when I could squint and see some credits did I realize that this was George Carlin.  Eventually I'd end up getting most of his performances on DVD or tape, but this is still hands-down the best.  My favorite skit is the classic ""Prison Farms/Balance the ****in Budget"" which I've done many the paper on.",1011052800,12,908,4.238372093023256
1810004,5,B00007G1WT,"This show it not only funny but very insightful. It combines comedy with brutal truth. It is a little slow to start off but after that he gets in to his violent humor which is what makes the show. His bit about Mickey mouse  is great and very, very filthy. This tape is perfect for a long time Carlin  fan but if you don't know his work to well it is best to go with Best Stuff  which is a bunch of short clips from most all of his acts.",958262400,9,437,3.8333333333333335
1810005,5,B00007G1WT,"What else would you expect from George. I have to say,you won't be a bit disappointed. It starts off slow(first 10 minutes.) Then it really picks up speed. The only bad part was when he left. As always you don't want to stop  laughing.",928540800,2,235,4.340909090909091

1810019,4,B00007G1WT,"[Written 1/12/11]  I love George, I really do. But this was not the right day to watch his long and rather gory bit about violence. Also, we have to admit that 15 year old jokes are sometimes a bit dated.

Still, I give it four stars, though not five, because I couldn't help laughing, and because George has such an incredible imagination. Also great delivery: does he really memorize all those crazy lists? The facial expressions and gestures and silly walks and all are not buffoonery, but part of the story.

This is a good show, but maybe wait until the story about the Tucson shooting is a little older before you watch it.",1336694400,,629,4.5
1810020,5,B00007G1WT,"I love anything by Carlin, books and all. But when he grew his hair long and let it all out, he became the one of a kind genius comic. Don't miss this one. And get ready for your jaw to ache from laughter! How I wish he was still with us.",1282003200,2,238,3.6862745098039214

1810023,5,B00007G1WT,"Watching these shows now after his untimely death, I appreciate them even more. Not only are they funny, they are completely engrossing as you watch a master at work! This is a great set! One of his best. Like a fine wine, George got better with age. To truly appreciate Mr. Carlin's brand of comedy you need to first have an open mind. Then you need to have a brain! 71 is too young to die and he so much more to say!

R.I.P. George
You will be missed.",1214870400,2,453,4.089887640449438

1810025,4,B00007G1WT,"George Carlin is a bit overrated. I do not feel that he is the greatest comedian ever,like a lot of people do. This is definitely his best performance. This routine is very political. It also contains a lot of social commentary. He sounds very angry in just about every routine on here. I do not like this particular style of comedy. Also,this is probably the most vulgar stand up routine I have ever seen. It uses every swear word in the dictionary numerous times. There are also plenty of sexual references. So if you have young children,DO NOT let them come CLOSE to ANY of George's DVDs. Otherwise,sit back and enjoy some good comedy.",1064966400,3,638,4.605263157894737
1810026,5,B00007G1WT,"George Carlin is one of my favorite comedians, being that he has never found a way to not make me laugh.  While I enjoy his older stuff the best, his new bitter and angry stuff is funny too.  ""George Carlin: Back in Town"" represents Carlin as he is today; angry, sarcastic, and over-the-top.  And it is all executed so perfectly.
He talks about everything, and does not hold back for one second.  Just when you think he can't say anymore to shock you, he does.  In this HBO special he talks about abortion, how capital punishment should be televised, the sanctity of life, state prison farms, familiar expressions, and more.  Plus, it includes one of my all time favorites: ""Free Floating Hostility;"" a very long rant about MANY things that tick him off.  The title is more than appropriate for it, believe me.
I wouldn't recommend him to people who get offended easily or don't like controversial topics being jokes like abortion or religion.  And he does have quite a mouth on him, so if you do not like profanity you better skip it right now.  However, if you ARE a fan of the man, then I recommend getting this as soon as possible!  I've had the CD for quite some time, but it's nothing like seeing him in action.
The DVD doesn't really have any special features or anything extra to offer (or at least nothing I am aware of).  The picture looks great and the sound is really good.  It would've been cool if there was an interview or two, perhaps a documentary would be nice.  Still, it is a worthy purchase.
""George Carlin: Back in Town"" is a hilarious DVD and an outrageous HBO special.  As soon as you pop this baby into your DVD player, you know you're in for one hell of a ride.  So strap in, get that crash helmet on, and make sure you're not drinking too many liquids while watching this... chances are they won't be staying in your mouth long since you will be laughing non-stop!",1049500800,21,1891,4.440579710144927
7976400,5,B00007G1WT,"George Carlin is my favorite comedian, and he did not disappoint me here. This 2003 HBO stand-up performance is the ninth that Carlin did for HBO out of the fourteen in total. His comments are brilliant, acerbic, thought-provoking, on-point, and I am always impressed how he is able to remember all the many things he says during his hour presentation without a single slip-up.
He mocks many things in this performance, such as views on abortions. He comments, for example, that those people who are against abortion, who want to protect the new life, don't care a bit for the child after he or she is born. If the fetus is a person, he asks, why aren't they counted in the census?
He speaks also about the different ways that we kill people. He spends time mocking dozens of expressions that people make, such as ""being more than happy,"" how is this possible? When you are asked to testify in your own words, are these words different than English?
He tells us about many things people do that annoy him, as white people who copy blacks and wear baseball caps backwards.",1510099200,,1071,4.612565445026178
7976401,5,B00007G1WT,"Back in 1982, Congressman Barney Frank said that for pro-life advocates, ""life begins at conception and ends at birth."" But here, George Carlin uses that remark as a launching pad for an astonishing hour of humor that takes no prisoners. I can't think of another comedian who was so brilliant for so long as Carlin. And he was never better than he is here.

One nit and it's not with him. Rather, the X-Ray feature of the video player says Carlin made a factual error when he referred to viruses as life. The issue of whether viruses are alive or not is still not a matter of settled science.",1506124800,,592,4.431192660550459
7976402,5,B00007G1WT,"I have always enjoyed listening to his comedy. It's thought provoking, dynamic, energetic, and as honest as a comedian can get.
