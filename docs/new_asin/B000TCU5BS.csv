8225327,4,B000TCU5BS,"This is a very informative DVD. Enya talks about growing up and how much music has played a part in her family life. What a wonderful way to grow up. Music as the constant. She talks about the music she has made over the years. She talks about the making of her videos. The funny things that happened on the set while filming. Very intreresting and informative. This is a music series on DVD. In the begining of the DVD it shows the other ""stars"" that have been showcased in this series. As for as the region setting, it is true. The only place I could find to buy this DVD was Japan, with a region code of 2. I own a region free DVD player. ""A DVD player that plays DVD's that are made anywhere in the world."" So until you own a region free player or ""they"" distribute  region free copies of the DVD, your SOL. If you do buy a region free DVD player, all the better. You will never be bothered again with this problem. You will be able to watch DVD's from ANYWHERE in the world. Since I purchase DVD's from about every country in the world, it has been a great investment. So I would recommend this DVD to Enya fans worldwide. And BUY a region free DVD player.",1191628800,,1161,4.16
