8576929,5,B001DYLX3K,"WE very much need English subtitles for this simply gorgeous film of the historic struggle for emancipation by peoples and their communist teacher 'saviours' in far-flung parts of the Soviet Union. The beauty of the landscape, the weather, the romance and the harsh survival, above all the beauty of the clashing cultures, and the passionate observation of all these - also has a script which is full of insight. But with no English subtitles, those of us unlucky enough not to speak Russian simple can't enjoy to the full... pity.",1299110400,,531,4.911111111111111
