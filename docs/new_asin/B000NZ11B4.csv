8182463,1,B000NZ11B4,I bought the DVD version of this at a half price bookstore.  I'm glad I only paid $6.00 for it.  The body trends website says it's intermediate to advanced.  I'm intermediate and I was not challenged by this workout at all.  I would consider it a beginners workout.,1189814400,,265,4.458333333333333
