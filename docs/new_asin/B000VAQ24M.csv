8217840,1,B000VAQ24M,Wish I'd never purchased this. Bad writing and acting. It does not begin to equal its two predecessors and adds nothing to the epic tale.,1467590400,,137,4.52

8217844,1,B000VAQ24M,"The first two books were fantastic. That goes for the first two of the miniseries as well. It's perhaps the best  TV miniseries I have ever watched. Even years later watching it again I marvel at the intricate stories, the struggles and conflicts  of love, war, family and friendships. The characters were all so dynamic in their own way, yet they also complemented one another to make the entire story, even the fictional  part of the Civil War so compelling.  You fell in love with both the real and fictitious characters.  Having the fictious characters be a part of the real historic persons was clever , unique and genius of the author.  Notice that this could not really be done in Book 3.  That part of reality was removed, except for the Klansman and the ugliness of racial hatred that still is part of our real lives  today.

Mr Jakes is a fantastic author, I'll always respect and love this masterpiece he created, However,  Book 3 Heaven & Hell is beyond bizarre and fortunately for me did not ruin the great legacy of the entire series.  I can almost excuse the death of Ory.  That was tough enough, or even the murder of Constance.  The way George and Madeline were joined after the murders just perplexed me. It was almost  like incest. That could never be a happy ending in my eyes no matter what events unfolded at the end,  just a totally weird ending that made me more disappointed Ory died.. It's almost like I wished I never knew what happened after Book 2, that's how disappointed I was.  I can deal with unhappy endings, because that's almost believable.  The plot of this particular  book, was not well thought out.  The friendship of Ory and George was a huge part of the entire series, but the Civil War itself and  slavery being part of the plot was an absolute necessity . Stay with the first 2 Books and leave Heaven and Hell as far away as possible.  The first 2 Books  alone will endure for a lifetime. Enduring and timeless is what legacies should be about.",1423958400,2,1988,4.509803921568627

8217846,2,B000VAQ24M,"Book one and two I loved and could read them over and over again. I remember watching the mini series as a young adult.  I vaguely remembered some parts of them but for some reason I never had part 3.  I recently got it and watched all three.  If you are a fan of happily ever after, stop at book two. Everything in book 3 lets evil win over good.  Horrible!",1388188800,2,358,4.0
8217847,1,B000VAQ24M,"The point of the series was the friendship between George and Orry.  Without Orry, there is no point.  And having him killed off by a character who died in the earlier series involved a lack of coherence at the level I would expect from a daytime soap opera.  But I'm sure Days of our Lives would have probably given some interesting explanation before introducing the character back like nothing had happened.  Further, the production quality was terrible.  It reminded me of some X-Files episodes I once saw that had not been through full editing.  Echoes of feet walking.  Voices that sound like they were recorded with an old tape recorder.

I am a fan of the earlier two series.  I was so disappointed after ten minutes that I turned it off.  I had bought the whole set together, and think it was very worth it.  But if anyone has seen the other two series and is considering whether or not to buy this one, save your money.  This is like Godfather III, only moreso.  By far.  That was a somewhat decent movie considered in its own right.  It's just a total letdown as a Godfather movie.  This is not a decent piece of work in any respect.",1364860800,4,1144,4.454106280193237
8217848,4,B000VAQ24M,"Well as a big fan of North and South and wanting more,  I was very disappointed in North and South Heaven and Hell. I did not like Orry being killed off, and Madeline and George getting together among other things! I feel asleep on it also!",1360195200,2,240,4.217391304347826
