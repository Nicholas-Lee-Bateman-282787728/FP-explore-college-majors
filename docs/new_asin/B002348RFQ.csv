3841668,5,B002348RFQ,"I usually will buy a DVD like this and just be bored to tears with it.

Many times these type things tend to be just a repackaged rehash of readily available information. Often you have seen most of it before.

This DVD presents the Lurancy Vennum story in a nice change of pace documentary style. It doesn't leave you with the feeling that you just got duped. The film makers have added in the contributing stories of other people, notably all very young, who have had thier own encounters with the supernatural. This just seems to support the overall credibility of the Lurancy Vennum story.

If you have an interest in this kind of phenomena you cannot go wrong having this in your DVD library.

It can add considerably to your knowledge base and also make you think hard about your current beliefs on the afterlife. Some of the EVP's featured in this program, if genuine, are genuinely creepy and disturbing.

Chris did a great job putting it all together, backed up by old newspaper articles and other evidence.

The guys who made this (aka You're too old to be dressing like late 1980's/early 90's hair band members) have to be the worst interviewers EVER! One of them asks the same freaking question four times to the same kid in a 2 min interview (so it didn't hurt, you didn't feel any pain, so was it painful, you didn't feel anything?) WOW! That's a great contribution! Following that was ""You wasn't scared?"" DERP! The word is WEREN'T! You're supposed to be making a MOVIE! Hello!! How about learning a few interview skills before you make interviews part of your freaking movie?!? 2. The storyline was DISJOINTED, CHAOTIC, CONFUSING with no logical sequence or order! This fluff is a documentary based on a story, only there is NO STORY TOLD. Just unfocused meanderings.

3841686,1,B002348RFQ,"Okay so let's say you ignore the footage of the Oakridge Boys wannabe walking through the tombstones in a women's jacket six sizes too big (?!?!). Say you take out the Jim Jones-groupie psychics, and the kitschy film technique interspersed with scenes that must have taken so long to produce that they had to be reused six times a piece to recoup the cost of production (it's really the only explanation that I have). Take out the crack-hosers' ""man on the street"" testimonials (where did THESE chicks come from?) and excise the inevitable fat guys with guts hanging over their belts snipe-hunting in  for ghosts (they look for Bigfoot during the day). Pull out the two juvenile detention center chicks who are really just ""cutters"". You can even remove the poor young man who is literally crying not from recalling his possession, but because he is utterly humiliated by a parent who is clearly freakin' out of her mind and exploiting her son to feel special (I feel ya, kid). Remove all that, and what you have left  is ten minutes of unmitigated, redneck cliche' CRAP. They took a good story and turned it into... this. I won't even get started on the sound.

This documentary has actually very little to do with the Watseka Wonder, and degenerates very quickly into a series of irrelevant, disconnected and boring vignettes. Some content at the very least can be considered misleading, if not outright factually incorrect such as the history of the Manteno (IL) State Hospital. A quick Google search of one interviewee, Dewi Morgaine, reveals her to be a fetish model and adult entertainer. A Google search of another interviewee, Rosemary Ellen Guiley, PhD, reveals her to be nothing more than a low-rent Sylvia Browne. I have not found any mention of where she might have earned this doctoral degree. The lack of credible sources alone should completely discredit this piece of cinematic trash. But given that the filmmaker himself looks like a Kid Rock ""wannabe,"" (and shamelessly pans footage of himself at every available opportunity) it should come as no surprise.

3841714,1,B002348RFQ,"Seriously, a bunch of hillbillies doing their typical tall tales act. The only thing near to possession is their self delusional belief that the rest of us actually believe them.

3841715,3,B002348RFQ,"The Watseka Wonder didn't ring any bells for me, but I soon discovered that the case explored here was one I was somewhat familiar with  the extraordinary story of young Lurancy Vennum and her spiritual possession by Mary Roff, another girl from the same town who had died about a decade earlier.  What makes the story so powerful is the fact that this possessed girl convinced Marys parents that she was their dead child, demonstrating remarkable knowledge about Marys life and connections to even distant relatives.  This type of story is not unknown among those who believe in reincarnation, but this is something else entirely because Lurancy was two years old when Mary died.

So we have a compelling case of the paranormal here, one more than worthy of study and investigation.  The problem I have is with the Booth Brothers, who wrote, edited, directed, and produced this documentary.  I find it difficult to take the Booth brothers seriously as investigators  partly because they always dress like rejects from the band Poison, but mostly because they are basically filmmakers and showmen who like to use too many fancy technological tricks, sound effects, and music to juice up a story, as opposed to letting their evidence speak for itself.  Their s&eacute;ance at the Mary Roff house is a perfect example of their style: youve got a psychic sitting there hooked into some fancy biometric equipment, a laser display taking place all around him, with Ovilus responses thrown into the mix willy-nilly and totally devoid of the context in which they may have been recorded.  Its more of a carnival show than a serious investigation.  Elsewhere, the visual evidence they get so excited about tends to consist of images I cant make out at all (although they do catch one intriguing image in this case).  And how do they capture so many clear EVPs?  Heck, they capture over one hundred in just a few hours at the old Mary Roff house, which so far as I know isn't even reputed to be haunted.

In the end, I think this documentary is worth watching, but Im not convinced that the Booth Brothers added anything to a story that is more than capable of standing on its own.  If you're unfamiliar with that story, I do suggest you read up on it, though  its fascinating.",1396915200,7,2268,4.764705882352941

The only screaming was from the recording of the ""Emily Rose"" (Anneliese Michel) possession and it was more annoying than scary.

One little add-on to this documentary: photos and audio of the Annaliese Michel possession...aka Emily Rose.

They left the observer frustrated and alone, trying to figure out what they are trying to say. How it was packaged from scene to past to future to a different story, to another story in the middle of a different story, to a expert being edited into the scene with a paranormal psychic that really sounded as confused as the viewers and readers of this post are or were at this point.

3841739,1,B002348RFQ,"This is a farce of a documentary that uses a lot of cheap re-enactment scenes to try and make it scary. The Booth Brothers can't seem to decide if they want to make a documentary or a horror film. The story jumps all over the place going from historical events to emo kids who cut themselves and claim it's the work of the devil. I'm not sure what the point of this movie actually is, since almost all mental illness was considered to be the work of the devil. These poor kids suffered from epilepsy and quite possibly split personality disorder, but had to endure ""treatments"" to try and exercise the demons. Blood letting and cutting open the skull was a common way to let the evil spirits escape. Are the Booth Brothers really trying to make a connection between ""cutting"" and evil spirits? If you research The Watseka Wonder universally held as a hoax.

Really bad film making.",1376265600,4,881,4.540880503144654

3841741,3,B002348RFQ,"This DVD was filmed to my standards as to keep my eyes upon the screen as not to miss anything. As enjoying these types of movies, the titled enticed and I was not disappointed for renting it.",1374019200,,192,4.216216216216216
3841742,1,B002348RFQ,"I was lured into watching this because of the positive reviews and I cannot disagree more with them. The ""documentary"" was about the first possession story in history but throughout the episode, the main storyline is interpreted with testimonials of other possessed victims which have no apparent correlation to the Watseka Wonder. And they are not even well made testimonials - cuts of random images with unnecessary scary music to create mood, all just first person witness with no hard evidence to pack up their stories. The shots were low resolution like it is all made low budget with a handheld camera. All in all, unprofessionally shot, sloppy edits and looks like they don't have enough good material about the Watseka Wonder to fill up a full episode. What a total snooze.",1373068800,5,781,4.924242424242424
3841743,1,B002348RFQ,"All this movie is, is a compilation of stories of dozens of people who were allegedly possessed.  This is not a movie nor even a real documentary.  It is just a series of people with spooky music and old photos in the background discussing ghost and paranormal stories from across the globe.

It might have been interesting if they focused on just this one person, they claim to on the cover of the DVD, but it is not. For what it's worth, watch the exorcism of Emily Rose if you want that kind of scarey picture.  That was based on a real story and it is not a documentary either.

Thank you for reading my review.",1372636800,2,615,4.267241379310345
3841744,1,B002348RFQ,"This documentary is a really bad telling of a pretty interesting story. The biggest fault is that most of the people they interview are uneducated trailer trash and you will find yourself rolling your eyes every two minutes. It almost seems sad that they find people willing to say that they were ""possessed"" because they come off looking foolish or as if they are plain liars. It is horribly put together with annoying music to create fake ambiance. They would have done better just to talk over pictures instead of all of the hideous interviews with ""experts."" I was only looking for a movie to pass time on a stormy night in, and this was too boring to qualify. Even when just used for background noise, this film fails. Save yourself some time and find something else.",1372464000,36,772,4.642335766423358
3841745,5,B002348RFQ,"I'm unsure how legit a lot of the crew of expossessed people (true demonic possession is extremely rare), but the central story is well told and unusual to the max.  The paranormal footage from the asylum is really some of the best and creepiest footage I've seen.  All in all, well worth the time and consideration.",1372118400,,316,4.625
3841746,5,B002348RFQ,"Very nice documentary style film about various documented casses of possession and being spiritualy possessed.

3841747,1,B002348RFQ,This is not a good movie to watch if you are an actual horror buff.  Horror documentaries rarely come across as scary.  I couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes of this movie before feeling compelled to stop and write this review.,1371513600,,238,4.511627906976744
3841748,4,B002348RFQ,"I really enjoyed this video.  It was very interesting, not scary or creepy in the least.  I actually found it to be quite sad.  I'm so glad that the treatment for mental illness has come a long way over the years. Very good story.",1370822400,,230,4.181818181818182
3841749,2,B002348RFQ,"I am being generous in giving this two stars, but I will for the effort and the fact that this documentary brought a few cases to my attention that I had not previously known of.

It is, unfortunately, the same stuff that has been done for decade upon decade.  Depression, mental illness, personal problems, etc, = demons.  *sigh*

Anyway, this wasn't the worst documentary of this type I've seen, but it is close.  I had a difficult time even finishing it.

The upshot is that genuine mental illness is brought up here and not everyone in this work claims the people all suffered from ""possession.""

But this has all been done before - to death.  Still, if you enjoy this subject, you will likely find it to be much more tolerable than I did.",1370563200,,743,4.492537313432836

The side story about the people who claim to shave been possessed is not quite as strong, but is still interesting. The score was a bit too loud in places, at least watching on my Kindle HDX with skull candy headphones.
