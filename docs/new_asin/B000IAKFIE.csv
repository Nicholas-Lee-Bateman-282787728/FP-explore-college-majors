2654221,5,B000IAKFIE,"When I purchased this DVD, I was wondering if it would be similar to ""Mark of the Devil"", another 'torture' movie. To my satisfaction, it was better.  The plot of the movie was more interesting; the story keeps you 'glued' to the screen.  This gutt-filled movie is so realistic with devices and schemes to torture the condemned. This movie is filled with suspense! (NOTE: nudity and torture involved). Definitely NOT suitable for the squeamish or under-aged.  Hope you will enjoy this movie, it will make it well worth your purchase.  Enjoy!  Movie Critic-",1201392000,37,556,4.935483870967742
2654222,5,B000IAKFIE,"Classic 1970's gore...

Following the success of ""The Conqueror Worm"", and the ""Mark Of The Devil"" films, renowned horror actor Paul (aka Paul Mackey aka James Molin aka Jacinto Molina aka Paul Naschi)  steps up, and adds another monster to his resume, with ""Inquisition""!

Tis a bad time in this part of the world. The tyrannical rulers, are draining the public, there is little sustenance for the poor, and witchcraft is blamed for many troubles. Naschy enters as the resident witch hunter, and is soon torturing confessions out of many locals. In the dubbed, American version, there is a surprising amount of nudity, and many of the local women cluster together, as the girl who Naschy fancies, sells her soul, to catch a glimpse of the face of the man who killed her lover. There is reasonable 70's gore, and nudity, and when they shave Naschy's head, and burn him at the stake, he looks uncannily like the final immolation of ""the mole"", in Jodorowsky's ""El Topo"", yet seems prescient of Brando, in ""Apocalypse Now"" - Internet Movie Database User Comment.",1183420800,27,1060,4.845303867403315
8144658,4,B000IAKFIE,"INQUISTION with Paul Naschy: the Mondo Macabo Blu Ray presentation is excellent. Picture, colour, sound all good with choice of English or Spanish audio.

The movie is typical of the many colourful DVDs purporting to show the persecution of witches, complete with the required amount of torture scenes and nudity. It manages to accomplish all this quite well with some beautifully constructed sets.

However, if you wish to see a much more realistic vision of the nightmare of Inquisition I can highly recommend the 1970 movie WITCHHAMMER, based on unbelievable, but real events. KAN",1525564800,,583,5.191489361702128
