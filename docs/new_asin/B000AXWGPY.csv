2395507,3,B000AXWGPY,"Vol. 3 of this series focuses on things that happened in the last year or so. This is great because nobody remembers last year. I'm glad they didn't waste time showing anything interesting or featuring any rappers who matter. My favourite part is the feature on Twista vs. Bone Thugs n Harmony, which is Twista saying ""we never had beef"" and krayzie or whichever bone saying ""we never had beef"". Perfect material for a dvd titled Beef. I was particularly impressed by interviews with such stars as a guy who used to know 50 Cent, and a guy who kind of looks like Phife Dawg. I'm sure guys like KRS-One, Ice Cube and B-Real really wanted to come back, but they just weren't big enough names.",1139616000,,690,4.484126984126984
2395508,4,B000AXWGPY,"I thought this $hit was tight. For real cause the 50 cent V.S. the

Bang Em smurf was good,The Bone Thugs n Harmony V.S.Twista was

interesting...Nelly V.S. Chingy that beef was gay,but funny,

mostly gay cause both rappers suck and they aint hard. Then there

was lil Scrappy V.S. the police,huh?..i understand they were talkin about security guards but that has nothing to do with him

and a rap artist. Then there was Ludacris V.S. T.I. nothing happened but it was squashed quickly before it did hit the media. Lil Flip V.S. T.I.Was a hard one to figure out but i did

figure out how it started it was That T.I. was in flips trailer

and flip had a attitute in the thing about the Game Over remix

and then it furthered at a some show in atlanta. Then it was the game beefs with Yukmouth,Joe Budden...that beef suxx cause budden is trash then Him And 50 and thats the end. There really

should of been some old beefs but they might be in the next.",1135728000,,950,4.3522727272727275
2395509,3,B000AXWGPY,"Like the first reviewer said this one seems alot more rushed than the other 2. The T.I. VS Lil' Flip part was probably the best one as it actually had both people's sides of the story.  The ""50/ Bang Em' Smurf ; Game"" parts don't show 50's side at all also the 50 VS Game part is out-of-date since they said they had sqaushed it when they're still beefing now.  And then there's Lil' Scrappy vs The Cops?!.... Come on that's not even a beef.  Twista VS Bone Thugs (they had beef?) was kinda boring. Although DJ Kay Slay is a pretty good narrator I liked the other guy alot better.  The extras are pretty nice especailly footage from Game's infamous performance at Summer Jam.",1132272000,6,675,4.376
2395510,3,B000AXWGPY,"The third installment in QD3's ""Beef"" series chronicles some of hip-hop's most intriguing feuds. Unlike prior installments, this one centers mostly on beefs from the past two years. Featured here are 50 Cent vs. The Game, Nelly vs. Chingy, Lil' Flip vs. T.I., Game vs. Yukmouth, Twista vs. Bone Thugs & Harmony, and 50 Cent vs. Bang 'Em Smurf. While fans of the first two will no doubt rush out to pick this one up, they should be warned that this edition seems far more rushed and less detailed than its predecessors. Narrator DJ Kayslay who should be a perfect choice, given his moniker as the ""Drama King"" is far too energetic for his position. Most of the artists involved are relatively new to the game and don't really offer much of the ""mature advice"" that veterans like KRS-One and Ice-T showcased in earlier installments. The closest thing to an ""old school"" perspective is an intoxicated and clich&eacute;-heavy speech from Jim Jones in the DVD's ""special features"" section. The segments involving 50 Cent (versus Game, Bang 'Em) have no comments from him or anyone on G-Unit other than radio clips and as such come off as one-sided, though the Bang 'Em segment features an insightful explanation of their falling out from Smurf's comrade, Domination. Aside from concluding footage of the ""West Coast Peace Summit"", the program really doesn't do much to show closure on any of these feuds and even the ones that are announced as being ""squashed"" still feature less-than-kind post-match interviews from the participants. Given that they had access to such a groundbreaking event, it might have been cool for them to have included such feuds as Snoop Dogg vs. Death Row and Daz vs. Kurupt. All in all, it's a decent DVD but easily the weakest entry in the series.",1132012800,20,1771,4.848184818481848
2395511,4,B000AXWGPY,"Beef 3 gave me a better understanding of the Lil Flip and T.I. situation. Kayslay did a great job with narrating this movie. But I think at this point we are all ""Beef"" out. All three were good movies, but i'm NOT looking forward to another one.",1132012800,3,245,4.23404255319149
8080215,3,B000AXWGPY,The best beef in beef 3 was like the game vs gunit 50 cent then the other kinds of beef were kinda boring and this dvd is ok but not that good,1476144000,,142,3.46875

8080217,4,B000AXWGPY,"This was a good Beef DVD if you're thinking of getting this I would recommend. Not as good as the previous 2 but still good. 1 problem is that during the Bang Em' Smurf vs. 50 Cent beef is you only hear Smurf and Domination's side of the story, you don't get to hear 50's side. In this case it makes me feel very bad for Smurf.",1428883200,,327,3.8955223880597014

8080221,1,B000AXWGPY,"Beef 1 is the best one of the 4,the only reason worth watching is Pac',all the rest is just post-1996(Rap Game is Dead)malarkey,Biggie,G a y -Z, flab boy,mobb sleep are all whack, East Coast Rap unless it's 80s or BDI and Bootcamp Clik/SmiffnWessum it doesn't matter, And all these so-called ""Positive Rappers"" as Willie D once said Positivity ain't getting nobody paid. All these back-packers read Fake muslims(Nation of Islam is a Radical Communist Sect-yet they have an monopoly on bean pies and providing security for the industry,ironically the suspect last seen around BIG was an Bowtie wearing ""Peaceful"" follower.) The only ones worth listening to Yukmouth,Scarface,Willie D,Dru Down,E-40,Bone,Spice 1,GrandMaster Flash,Big Daddy Kane,but all these others are all over rated,Krs-one is one self centered sucka MC.Backpackers or bling rap is still dead.",1302566400,,860,5.5227272727272725
8080222,5,B000AXWGPY,"Hot movie. Beefs I liked were ""50 VS Bang 'Em Smurf & Domination"" and ""Game VS Yukmouth"" 50 Loses on every beef he comes up in, with exception of Ja Fool and Bitch-Zino (see Beef 1)

Only beefs that I hated were ""Chingy VS Nelly"" and ""Twista VS Bone Thugs"" Don't get me wrong I LOVE Bone Thugs music 2 death and Twista is iight but their beef was just stupid and almost nothing so there wasn't a point in showing it. AS for Chingy and Nelly, that is probably the next ""NSYNC VS Backstreet Boys"" type beef hahaha.

Go pick this dvd up now if you didn't already!",1150502400,,560,4.128440366972477
8080223,3,B000AXWGPY,it is a good documentary but i think it should have 50 cent's side of the story on the beef with the game.,1140825600,,106,3.652173913043478
