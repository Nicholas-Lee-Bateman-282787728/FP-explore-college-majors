1666414,3,B00005UPFL,"I too bought this due to some early 'rave' reviews, and after viewing it all can only think ""it's not too bad...at least it didn't cost a lot"".  The disc  basically has a narrator/host telling you the storyline of the Lord of the Rings interspersed with bland re-enactments, computer-generated geographic locations(nothing too complex or awe-inspiring), and interviews with 'experts'.  This stuff is ok, but nothing really insightful or extremely interesting(well, the story is...but you can/should read the books for that right?).  The two main selling points are some clips of the author and the art gallery.  The clips are, as many pointed out, a little hard to hear but it's good to see them nonetheless.  The big issue I have is with the Brothers Hildebrandt gallery.  When you try to view these in its 'extras' section, you get small versions of them...as if they were framed and mounted on the screen at a distance.  What moron decided to do this?  You get big full-screen versions of the artwork(most?) in the actual documentary(so i guess you can pause them then to enjoy the detail), but you'd have to sit/fast foward through the feature everytime just to do that.  The point of having a stills gallery is to access them all conveniently, but that's ruined by the artwork's small dimensions on the screen.  Anyway, I wouldn't recommended this unless you're a completist with money to spare, or a beginner who wants the 'cliff notes' on the books.  Not essential by any means due to its dissapointingly executed presentation, but not an entirely bad dvd either.",1036022400,36,1570,4.927756653992396
1666415,1,B00005UPFL,"I bought this DVD based on laudatory reviews I read here and was VERY disappointed in what I got. I was expecting background information on the author and his work, but this DVD contains very little of that. I don't understand HOW in the world it can bill itself as ""the definitive guide to the world of the rings."" What a joke.
My biggest single gripe is that a large part of the DVD consists of a synopsis of the Lord of the Rings, complete with bad renactments of some of the scenes. Not ONE of the ""actors"" looked remotely suitable for the part he was supposed to be playing, and they were wearing some of the most ludicrous costumes I've ever seen in my life. (Hobbits in plumed hats? Give me a break!) The whole thing was pointless and stupid. It was way too spoiler-ridden for anyone who hasn't read the books, and for those who had, it was stupendously BORING, due to being so poorly done. All in all, a complete waste of time.
Another large percentage of the screen time is given over to pretentious prattle from so-called ""experts"" who don't do a thing except spout their own precious opinions (as opposed to providing actual information that might help the viewer better understand the world created by Tolkien). And then there were the bits about artists and musicians influenced by Tolkien...can we say TEDIOUS, boys and girls? I can't understand why filmmakers think people are even interested in that stuff. I got this video because I wanted to to know more about Middle-Earth, not some no-name musician who wrote a few songs based on Tolkien's books.
The DVD also contains an attempt at rendering a 3D landscape of Middle-Earth. That was kind of interesting to watch, but unfortunately, it was not completely accurate. I think the Atlas of Middle-Earth would be a better way to get a handle of on the geography of Tolkien's world.
In short, I didn't learn a blasted thing from this DVD that I didn't know already. The only thing that was genuinely new to me was the clips of Tolkien speaking. I'll admit those were sort of amusing, but not, I think, for the reason intended. (Another reviewer here mentioned JRRT's ""unintelligble speech"" being captured on film. Unintelligible is definitely the word for it...the man may be a great writer, but he talked like he had a mouth full of pipeweed!) Those were worth seeing, but not worth the price of the DVD.
If anyone ever makes a GOOD video presentation on the life and work of Tolkien. I'd be happy to buy it. Unfortunately, this is not it.",1034380800,99,2504,4.604026845637584
1666416,4,B00005UPFL,"I purchased this DVD based on Amazon.com reviews and was disappointed before realizing how unfair it is to compare anything to director Peter Jackson's excellent Lord of the Ring movies that are coming out. This DVD's geographic landscapes were not as detailed as I had been led to believe; if you are hoping for realism, you would be better off consulting the maps in Tolkein's books. The use of human little-people as hobbits and dwarfs in dramatic snippets was sadly comical in contrast to the  Fellowship of the Ring's unbelievable special effects, which after all won an Academy Award, out of four total. It was somewhat interesting to hear Tolkein's  unintelligible speech in a filmed interview, and I suppose the narrative might help someone who had never read the books understand the story. But then who would buy this without having read the books?? Perhaps better to buy the extended version of the movie when it comes out in November, as I have.",1033084800,2,957,4.865030674846626
1666417,1,B00005UPFL,"Being a life long fan of Lord of the Rings I purchased this to expand my knowledge of the man who wrote this masterpiece.  Unfortunatly most of this documentary is spent in presenting an extremely abriged, and many times inaccurate, version of the books.  If I wanted a watered down version of the books I would buy the Animated versions instead as they were at least entertaining.  This on the other hand is boring to the extreme as a nasal voiced narator, bad computer graphics, and the horribly poor artwork of the brothers Hildebrant gang up to mutalate a great story.  Don't purchase this DVD, instead I suggest you pick up the National Geographics documentary which has amazing production value and much more information on Tolkien.",1029628800,13,738,4.833333333333333
1666418,3,B00005UPFL,"J.R.R. Tolkien: Master Of The Rings manages to be a fairly informative and entertaining piece of work despite its obivious low budget. Even this is only a major hinderance in the footage enacting scenes from The Lord Of The Rings, which resemble nothing so much as some home videos made by a bunch of guys in the Society for Creative Anachronism.
Having said that, there are many good bits here, the most impressive of which are the computer-generated 3D maps of Middle-earth, which are actually quite stunning.
One final word to the Tolkien neophyte: if you haven't read Lord Of The Rings all the way through, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. There is a detailed plot synopsis of the entire novel toward the beginning of the movie which reveals the ending of the book. If you haven't read LOTR and feel you must watch this, make sure you skip Chapter 4 on the chapter menu.",1028160000,3,865,4.587096774193548
1666419,4,B00005UPFL,"I do not regret my purchase of this DVD - I am a fan and a student of J.R.R.Tolkien and have been since I first read his books in 1973.  Seeing him ""in person"" was a treat.  And the illustrations by the Hildebrandt brothers who basically captured the essence of these stories for me thrilled me; I have been collecting their art for years as well.  Unfortunately there just wasn't enough.  Not enough interview time with Tolkien, not big enough view of the illustrations - there were over 50 of these but they were visually very small on the tv screen - as they were framed and the floated in the center of the screen.  Interesting historical notes and comments and antedotes - just not enough, never enough.",1015632000,4,708,4.5
1666420,5,B00005UPFL,"As a long time fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, I was disappointed to find very few decent film biographies of my favorite author....that is, until now.  This DVD provides an excellent biographical insight to Professor Tolkien and his most famous work, The Lord of the Rings.  It contains a 3-D map which leads  novices and long time fans through the various areas of Middle Earth; interviews with various Tolkien scholars (an illustrator, a professor,  a member of the Tolkien society, a literary critic and even 2 of Prof. Tolkien's children); a re-enactment of The Lord of the Rings (so to those who haven't read the books - spoilers abound!), and wonderful interview clips of the ""master"" himself!  It also contains art work and drawings from the Hildebrandt brothers as well as other Tolkien illustrators.
Do not confuse this with the other (unauthorized) ""Master of the Rings"" DVD (as one critic below apparently did - hence the 1-star rating).  This is an excellent resource for novices and long-time Tolkien fans alike!  I must admit I've viewed this DVD several times and enjoyed it each time.  The highlights for me were watching Professor Tolkien read passages from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as well as the LOTR re-enactment (amateurish perhaps but entertaining nonetheless - this is no Peter Jackson production!).
I highly recommend this DVD to Tolkien and Lord of the Rings fans everywhere.  It certainly is more scholarly in its approach - there are no references to the current films by Peter Jackson - but is a must have for any Tolkien library.
If you want more information on the current films, I would also suggest you check out the National Geographic Lord of the Rings DVD/video which contains considerable references and clips of the films. But if you also want to learn more about Professor Tolkien and his works, then this DVD is for you.",1015545600,8,1871,4.8584905660377355
1666421,1,B00005UPFL,"This is the saddest attempt to cash in on the movies I have seen.  Not only does it have nothing to do with the movie, it is not even good Tolkien.  It consists of an interview with one of the lesser illustrators, music by an unknown British singer, of dubious talents, a very poor tour of Oxford (the outsides of places where Tolkien lived), interviews with non-Tolkien experts (Oxford students and low level dons), and a lot of footage of people who like to role-play being warring elves and goblins.  The only ""professional"" bit is an interview with one of Tolkien's biographers, and that is not much.  If this thing had been better described, on the web page, I would have never wasted my time buying it.  It is the only thing I have ever bought on Amazon that I was not satisfied with.",1014076800,12,790,4.458333333333333
1666422,5,B00005UPFL,"Finally a very informative collection of film, 3D maps, a chronological detail narrative about the ""Lord of the Rings"", comments from Tolkien scholars, JRR Tolkiens son & daughter. Plus some film and the voice of the Master Of the Rings himself, JRR Tolkien.
This is a very exciting Full Screen DVD.
Summary:  We get many features with this great ""Tolkien Definitve Guide"" to Middle Earth.  1.) An 80 minute film with the telling and explanation of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  Narrated, and comments provided by scholars, musicians, Tolkien family members, friends and JRR himself!!!  Within this film you have extensive information and superb detailed 3D graphic maps used to move you through the telling of the trilogy.  Also the narrator provides very simplified & detailed chronological explanation of this complex tale of JRR Tolkiens, Middle Earth.  2.) A very delightful Illustrations Gallery by the artists ""Brothers Hilderbrandt (probably the most famous of the Tolkien Calender Artists).  3.) Musicians Music Videos from Middle Earth - very nice addition.  4.) Comments from various English Scholars and Famous English Musicians (ie Rick Wakeman).
The crowning jewel of this DVD is seeing and hearing the Master himself, JRR Tolkien on film.  Making his comments and explanations about his lifes work of ""Middle Earth"".  Plus he does a couple of brief readings from the ""Hobbit"".  This is worth the price of admission alone!!!!
A great value and an invaluable addition to the Tolkien DVD Library.  So don't wait get this DVD!!!!!  This is a golden opportunity to enter and possess the  masters tool of an unforgetable journey into the world of JRR Tolkiens ""Lord of the Rings"".  Enjoy.",1011139200,60,1701,5.134545454545455

1666465,3,B00005UPFL,"It's been a long time since I watched the massive extras from the Peter Jackson LOTR films but I recall learning an awful lot from therm...and they were entertaining and fun (the bits about Tolkien's life and the creation of this world).  Watching those will spoil you.  20 years ago this Master of the Rings DVD set would have been great.  It does cover a bit about where Tolkien came from and the genesis for creating The Hobbit and later LOTR.  The best part is the 3D map of Middle Earth and getting to see the locations while hearing about them.  The live action recreations are hokey but they serve their purpose with a minimal budget.  It also covers the influence the books have had on literature and music.  The Brothers Hildebrant paintings are wonderful to see.  The set includes a booklet with some of the illustrations (50 of them are an extra on the DVD).  Other DVD extras include interactive interviews and inspirations (this section runs 11 minutes and has footage not seen in the documentary).  There's also an added CD of music selections by Rick Wakeman, the keyboardist from the band, Yes.

If you are old enough to have known and loved Tolkien's work long before the Peter Jackson films beginning in 2001 (like before the Reagan administration), then you might find this worth your time.  Will you watch it more than once?  Probably not, but it does have that CD you might dig.  If the 2001 film is what brought you to read the books or at least get into the genre, you should save your money.  Right now you can get this set for under $4 shipped.  It's worth it but hopefully you've got an idea of what you're getting so you won't waste your time on top of the four clams.",1402099200,,1695,4.490196078431373

The booklet features the illustrations of the Brothers Hildebrandt. Since I enjoy their work I am happy to receive examples in booklet form. The DVD is harder to describe. The map of Middle Earth is fun to watch. The interviews present thoughtful insights. And the archival footage of J.R.R.T. is an added bonus. If I could ask the producers of this set anything,it would be: ""Why wasn't Christopher Tolkien included among the people being interviewed""?",1334361600,2,570,4.876288659793815
1666517,4,B00005UPFL,"I have only a few comments to contribute to the discussion.

The DVD: Overall, I found the interviews in the tutorial interesting.  I was glad for the opportunity to see Tolkien's daughter and his son who is a priest, and to hear their remarks.  Likewise glad to be able to watch and listen to Tolkien himself speak.  I'd already heard that his manner of speaking was difficult to understand, and that was truly the case.  I was able to pick up probably about a third of what he said.  (Imagine how anxious his students must have felt whilst trying to comprehend his lectures!)  This DVD is something that I think I will need to listen to several times in an effort to pick up on all that it has to offer, and not only with regard to Professor Tolkien.

Maps:  As for the maps, all maps that I've seen so far in any resource don't really help me get my bearings straight in Middle Earth.  Also, I've found them mostly boring.  Since I like the idea of maps accompanying epic stories, I hope that someday someone will make a map of Middle Earth that I find really fascinating, whether or not it is helpful.

Illustrations by the Brothers Hildebrandt:  I'd been wanting to see the illustrations by the Brothers Hildebrandt and I felt satisfied by what I was able to see of them on the DVD and in the accompanying booklet.  However, the 50 illustrations so amply provided on the DVD were difficult to see because they were so small.  The illustrations in the booklet were easy to see but were few in number.  The artwork was vividly colorful.  The Hildebrandt illustrations reminded me, in general, of a certain type of children's storybook art. I liked many of the pictures.  The one of Eowyn meeting the Nazgul in battle stands out in my memory.

From what I could see of the illustrations overall, I was interested to note how much Peter Jackson and his artists honored the precedent set by the Hildebrandt illustrations.  But not in every case.  I think the Hildebrandt conception of Rivendell gave me the longest, most thoughtful pause, because it was very unlike my first experience of Jackson's Rivendell in the movie trilogy, and it was also unlike what I myself might imagine Rivendell to be.

I didn't care personally for the way the Hildebrandt pictures handled the Hobbit race differently from the other Middle Earth peoples, so that the Hobbits looked sometimes like ""comic"" caricatures of children.  I'm glad that Jackson's movie has given a sense of mature human dignity somehow to the Hobbits even though they are small people with simple, down-to-earth tastes and pleasures.

Another thing I disliked in the tutorial was the repetition of the same pointless and boring scene within the same uninteresting landscape, depicting the characters in an old LOTR film slowly walking, seemingly vacant-mindedly, and then again walking, and walking some more.  This seemed to me to be time-wasting filler material.

The CD:  The music of Rick Wakeman that is supposed to be a ""journey through the landscapes of Middle Earth"" was excellent, enjoyable, above my expectations.  There were classical elements in it, especially with the piano, and I don't know the term for the other musical elements that seemed to me to be like some of modern  ""relaxational"" music.  It's lovely to listen to this CD with headphones at bedtime before going to sleep, or anytime you want to fill your home with elegant, exceptionally good music.",1326672000,4,3429,4.772495755517827
1666518,2,B00005UPFL,"The host is great and some of the experts interviewed are fine, but the rest of the material is sub-standard.  Witness the recreations of scenes from the books: The hobbits are played by midgets wearing tacky feathered hats - the guy playing Frodo is probably 70 years old.  The guy playing Aragorn, on the other hand, is maybe 28 and probably moonlights as an underwear model.  Very little included about Tolkien's interesting life and how it shaped his Middle-earth stories.  While I love the Brothers Hildebrandt illustrations, these are used so often you get tired of them.

Think of this as a very poor Cliff Notes for the video age.  If it were my first exposure to Tolkien, I'd never look further.",1093478400,5,704,4.729508196721311

1666520,2,B00005UPFL,"For those who have given this five stars have most likely not read the books, or else read the books when they were children and remember almost nothing of the facts. The only two interesting things about this DVD is the footage of Tolkien (which isn't really that much) and the 3D map, but even that is wrong, as any real Tolkien enthusiast can tell you. The artwork is interesting, but I've seen a lot better (check out artist Alan Lee, who actually also worked on the film and is world renown). It also has some reenactments of the book, but these are a little lame (they could've done a lot better). But the biggest thing that gets to me about this DVD is that though it tells the story in a condensed version, it presents a lot of misinformation, such as saying that it was Merry who destroyed the Witch-king (everyone knows it was Eowyn). It also states that the ethnic difficulties present in Middle-earth that were set aside for the Fellowship is comparable to the same that happened during World War II with the Allies and the Axis powers. This goes against the very things Tolkien (and his son Christopher) have said, that the Lord of the Rings is in no way allegorical.
So, in all, this may be of some interest to those who love the movies, but have never/not yet read the books, but for fans of the books, I recommend that you stay away from this and save your money! (Luckily I only spent $6 on this!)",1078272000,8,1414,4.400763358778626

However there is no new information here that you haven't seen in the nth docus done on Tolkien since the trilogy hit the silver screen. After you get past the biography info, you're subjected to talking heads droning on and on... none of which I could recall even under torture.
The worst part of the docu is a ""synopsis"" of the entire trilogy. One of the talking heads goes on and on, while the viewer is subjected to hazy video of dwarf actors in bad costumes ""acting out"" the story. It's utterly ridiculous! This is the point that I bailed out and I haven't touched the DVD since.
One of the reasons I bought this (besides it was cheap!) was the bonus CD of Rick Wakeman's music. Now, I've been a big fan of Yes in the past, and even of Wakeman's solo music. Some of the music is quite pleasant, but some is also quite ordinary. WARNING: all the music on the disc is retitled cuts from previous Wakeman discs. NOTHING on the CD is new music.

Tolkien speaking in his rapid-fire mumble leave one feeling sorry for the students who had to take notes during his lectures.

Don't misunderstand.  There is some very interesting material in here, some good insights by Napoli, and the Sandhurst instructor, and the real reason for which I bought it, Tolkien himself.  However, there was way too much time wasted in amateurishly produced re-enactments of the story, which were redundant in the extreme for a person who is moving outwards from LotR (books or films) and into Middle-Earth as a whole.

The makers did not seem to know what they wanted to do.  Their production vacillated from being a showcase of the art of the Brothers Hildebrandt - as if they were the ONLY artists ever to paint ME - through being the promised ""guide"" - the CG maps were neat, and the discussions of the sources of JRRT's inspiration were good, if somewhat meager - to being (as mentioned above) a synopsis of LotR.  Not a lot of guiding done, I'm afraid.  There is more information for the curious mind in the Appendices at the end of Return of the King.
Simply put, do not expect too much from this production, and you will not be too disappointed.  Cuio mae, Celefinn Curunisse",1043193600,18,1111,4.695876288659794
