While not conventional looking, his elegance, wit and intelligence will win you over and these characteristics fit the role of the Scarlet Pimpernel perfectly.  Unlike the Anthony Andrews/Jane Seymour TV movie, this was a mini-series, so there is more than adventure to enjoy.",1417478400,,355,5.2105263157894735

1256688,4,B000031VPF,I enjoyed this boxed set and it was like new.  This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is nothing like the Merle Oberon/Leslie Howard version (which is my all time favorite) but I enjoyed it very much and I'm glad I purchased it.,1395273600,,227,4.404761904761905

1256690,3,B000031VPF,"I only recently got the chance to watch these episodes, but I am glad I did. For background, let me explain, I have read the book and love the Anthony Andrews adaption. That did not, however, deter my enjoyment. True, this Pimpernel differed greatly (such as his lack of costumes, his ability to kill is greatly displayed, and he wasn't that much of a fop,) but he kept the spirit. He did keep an act in public; he loved Marguerite dearly, and he was every bit a swash-buckling hero. I did have some concerns over the choice for his wife. She is older, a little frumpier (no doubt due to poorly chosen make-up,) and she did not appear to have the same spirit as Jane Seymour, but when I saw her in the third episode, playing a role for Robespierre and Percy, I knew she was Marguerite, even if it took me that long to truly see it. The choice for Chauvelin was interesting. At first, he was every bit the perfect choice, but as time went on, he was less so. Robespierre was creepy to me. I don't know if it was intentional, but I expected him to make a weird giggle at any moment (he didn't.) The rest of the cast, I had little problem with. Other main concerns include the death of Sir Anthony Dewhurst in the first episode (he was a favorite character of mine) the lack of disguises and the large amount of violence from Percy, the lack of wit he uses in his escapades, and many central elements of the book left out of the first episode (which covers the source material.)
Overall, I have to give it three stars. It kept to the spirit of The Scarlet Pimpernel, but there were too many moments that had me shaking my head to be higher.",1382227200,,1637,4.283870967741936

1256694,2,B000031VPF,"There is irony in the fact that when I came here to review this the advertisement shown was for ""The Dark Knight Rises.""  I had just been shaking my head over the fact that whoever filmed this apparently decided to loan Sir Percy Batman's utility belt.

I've read the books and enjoyed them, but I don't insist that a Scarlet Pimpernel movie be a down-to-the-last-detail adaptation.  But this show had a crudeness and vulgarity that the novels simply didn't have, and it seems to me that if you're going to appropriate a book's title the least you should be expected to do is not butcher the entire flavor of the story.

 This Scarlet Pimpernel isn't demmed elusive, he just goes storming in with more weaonry than his opponents and kills people right, left, and center.  The elusiveness is what the story is supposed to be about:  a trickster who outsmarts his opponents and is almost always so many steps ahead of him that he doesn't need to resort to brute force.  There was no delight in watching it - ha!  I didn't see that coming!  Oh, marvelous! - as there should be.

The book was wildly romantic in a purple-prose sort of way, and I simply can't see this version of Sir Percy kneeling down to kiss the ground Marguerite has walked on.  And there is very little difference between the way this one acts when he's being Sir Percy and when he's being the Pimpernel; no reason anybody would dismiss the very thought that Sir Percy might be the intrepid, mocking shadow that is driving the French authorities to distraction.

Even apart from those objections, the story is quite muddled.  Having read the books, I knew pretty much what was going on, but if I hadn't I would have been left baffled.

Complete lack of chemistry between Percy and Marguerite

Do yourself a favor:  Watch the Leslie Howard version, or the Anthony Andrews version.  This one isn't even going to stay in my video collection.  A la laterne with this DVD!",1351900800,,1934,4.60233918128655
1256695,3,B000031VPF,"If you're a harcore fan of the novels, don't watch this. You will be disapointed.

If you found this off of the 1982 version of the movie, go ahead and watch it but you might be disapointed too.

If you don't know anything about The Scarlet Pimpernel, you'll probably think it's fine as a one-time thing.

What this version of the Scarlet Pimpernel tries to do is make Sir Percy more of a Bond character than he was originally intended to be. Richard E. Grant was an inspired choice. He has the posh dork routine down pat. Elizabeth McGovern was not so great a choice as she seems lifeless and Martin Shaw would have been fine if they hadn't tried to make him sexy.

The biggest problem here is not the actors, nor is it the hideous clothes and makeup (I could overlook the atrocity of those wigs and gowns given the proper incentive). Even the violence, which others have decried, I could have gone with. That is what gets audiences these days, after all. No, the big issue is that the scripts lack wit and any element of surprise. You always know what's going to happen, there are no strong relationships between the character, and there is a total lack of suspense.

1256696,4,B000031VPF,"Okay, first off: I have read several of the books by Baroness Orczy.

That, if you catch my meaning, is not THIS.

THIS being the three episode set with Richard Grant. I thought some parts excellent, some cheesy - but good cheese. Grant himself I thought excellent as the Pimpernel. He plays the witty fop perfectly - not lazily, but one who travels, and seeks new things to be witty about. When the serious things begin, he sobers up, and you get to see the real Pimpernel. Grant rarely lets the drama of the situation weigh him down, consistently has fun with his role. Though not emphasized, his sword-play is quite passable, too.

Elisabeth McGovern as Marguerite is the questionable one here. At some points, you think she is perfect for the role; at others, you wonder how they chose her to play the part. Her British accent is passable when she remembers it; and - my biggest gripe - I did not think her pretty enough for the role. She is an attractive actress, yes, but not the knockout Marguerite was supposed to be - The Most Beautiful Woman in France? I think not. Her acting is on the whole good, however, as is her stage presence, so much can and is overlooked.

My biggest surprise was Martin Shaw as Chauvelin. Shaw took the role and made more of it than either Raymond Massey or Ian McKellen, combining the past lover with man striving to be in constant control of the situation. His gift for sarcasm, whether natural or invented for this role, is put to good use here. He actually seems almost human at times, trying to serve himself, and France (yes, I did get that feeling). By contrast, McKellen's Chauvelin cannot get his mind off Marguerite, and Massey's (excellent) portrayal seems one dimensional (not his fault). Martin Shaw was one of the strongest points of this production.

The supporting cast was equally good. Emilia Fox (I think that's the right spelling) portrays an excellent bad girl in Episode I, While the bad guy of Episode III is superb - almost stole the show from Grant. EPisode II features another excellent bad girl who meets a surprising end. Sets and costuming are what befit a BBC production, and the camera work is excellent: frequent use of distance and panorama make it seem something other than a TV movie. Storyline and plot - it makes sense taken by itself, and provides a good, exciting romp through the world of Revolutionary France. Not close to the book, but it doesn't need to be close to the book to be effective. If you're an Orczy purist, don't bother with it. If, like me, you're looking for good period drama with a flair for action and comedy, this is excellent. And well-worth seeing, and re-seeing. Enjoy.",1315094400,,2670,4.624472573839663

of course 1982 pimpernel with seymore/andrews is the best but this version is quite good.  if seems the main concensus is that this version skips the initial meeting and courtship.  if you watch the 1930 something version with leslie howard (who was excellent as sir percy), that version also starts with him loathing his wife.  it seems that the 1982 is the only version that give you the prequel.

1256700,5,B000031VPF,I first saw this series a few years ago. My friend saw it on tv and bought it when she saw it offered on tv. We watched it so much we had to buy a second set because we wore it out! Now I have my own copy!,1263686400,,205,3.2916666666666665

1256702,5,B000031VPF,A&E did taek some liberties with the book but only for the better!!  The casting was more believable and realisitic compared to the Jane Seymour farce version.

1256703,4,B000031VPF,"Between the Horatio Hornblower movies and the Pride and Prejudice set that A&E has released, one has come to expect great things from their classics productions. The Scarlet Pimpernel set is by no means bad but it doesn't quite stand up to their really excellent standards. The directors, I think, are the issue here. The cast is marvelous, Chauvelin in particular! Sir Percy is played by Richard E. Grant who does a very good job. At first, I found him irking and not up to the part. After all, Sir Percy is a man of great depth playing a lazy fool and Grant has simply too much energy. Granted, that this is his greatest drawback is telling. He did end up growing on me quite a bit...perhaps mirroring Marguerite's experience. Fitting, is it not? As to the production as a whole, there was much content added to the first movie which was totally unnecessary (regarding the others, I cannot tell - I've only read the first book). The additions are not disturbing the way unnecessary additions often are, only that there was some rather inappropriate sex which brought down the quality of the films. As far as the direction is concerned, it's the main flaw of the movies. A terrible truth, but there it is. There was too much going on (much unnecessary additions) and thus there wasn't enough time to flesh out all the little conflicts and conversations which made the book so engaging. On the bright side, Chauvelin is amazing, Marguerite is well played, Percy is delightfully devilish, and the costumes are simply gorgeous! Lord, Percy has truly impeccable style. Absolutely wonderful greatcoats! All in all, it was somewhat disappointing but was worth the purchase. I'll be watching these time and again, with greater joy every time no doubt.

1256704,4,B000031VPF,"The Scarlet Pimpernel Box Set contains:

Disk 1 The Scarlet Pimpernel
Disk 2  Mademoiselle Guillotine
Disk 3 The Kidnapped King

I enjoyed watching disk 2 Mademoiselle Guillotine the most. It had a relatively easy-to-follow plot-line as well as interesting characters (and decent acting).

The other two episodes were too compacted in my opinion. They combined too much too quickly, leaving the viewer a bit confused (especially if the viewer is not familiar with the novels). Furthermore, while a film should not necessarily be the novel in action, this A&E production takes incredibly liberties with characters and plot.

Now, I purchased ""The Scarlet Pimpernal"" as part of the A&E romance collection volume 1 from Barnes and Noble during a sale for $49.00. The romance collection volume 1 contained many other A&E romances such as ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Emma,"" ""Jane Eyre,"" ""Victoria and Albert,"" and ""Ivanhoe."" If ""The Scarlet Pimpernal"" was not part of the collection, I would never have watched A&E's version of ""The Scarlet Pimpernal.""

As it is, I appreciate the effort, the ""Indiana Jones"" effect of Richard Grant's acting, and the increased emphasis given to Chauvelin's character. It makes for great action (but maybe not-so-great romance).

Mr. Grant added a dimension that was unique: he was all the Pimpernel should be and incredibly charismatic. All the acting was excellent, but his stood out in particular since he embodied the hero so well and was so charming. I will miss not being able to watch more of this excellent actor. Someone in an earlier review criticized him as not being their idea of a leading man. To me, he was one of the best leading men I have seen in ages.

I know a lot of people look at Mr Grant and only see and evil or as one put it, sniviling character. If you ever read the book you will see a rather unsexy story.

He was sort of a smash-and-grab type with fancy gadgets in this movie, which is the exact opposite of what made the scarlet pimpernel such a great character in the book and other adaptations.  The main character (in script and action) lacked the grace, wit, and mystery of the book, which (let's be honest) is the whole point.  Also, if memory serves correctly, they sort of butchered the story, which always seems to happen.  I remember having very high expectations, on account of this being a longer film, because I assumed it was long because they were being really loyal to complexity of the original story.

1256716,2,B000031VPF,"I am a big Percy Blakeney/Scarlet Pimpernel fan and have read Orczy's book at least 3 times.  Based on the strength of a customer review on this webpage, I purchased the boxed DVD edition, featuring Richard E. Grant & Elizabeth McGovern.  The scripts were written by Richard Carpenter.

I was VERY DISAPPOINTED by this screen version of the story.  I do NOT recommend it to any true Percy fan.

I have viewed 3 movie versions of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and this one is by far the worst.  Perhaps screen-writer Carpenter never read the book; perhaps he simply decided to take ENORMOUS LICENSE with the characters.  In either event, the script eliminated much of what was delightful about Orczy's Percy and turned Marguerite into a mild-mannered wimp without the wit or resources to save herself from her own stupid decisions.  Even worse, Marguerite was constantly in need of being rescued by her husband or, ironically, her former lover/the series villain, Chauvelin.

Here are some reasons for my conclusions:

Percy Blakeney, whom Orczy described in her book as the ""master of disguise"" never ONCE dons a disguise in this movie series (unless you consider wrapping a black scarf around the lower face a disguise).  And **HELLO!!** wouldn't the French be a tad bit suspicious of 3 black-cloaked, black-masked figures strutting around the streets of Paris in broad daylight?  (The French certainly arrested other characters for less!)  These scenes were so contrived, they were painful.  And yes, while it was certainly clever to have Percy escape ala James-Bond gadgetry -- this contrivance negated Orczy's portrayal of Percy as a man whose WIT was his first and primary weapon for defense and escape.  In fact, I found Percy (in this DVD collection) to be more fond of slicing and dicing enemies, than of using his unmatched cunning to save himself and his compatriots.  This twist on Percy was truly, truly disappointing -- the author must be turning in her grave.

As for the romance in Orczy's story...  Neither the actor nor the screen-writer were EVER able to convince me that Percy was the kind of man whom a woman (or a nation) could adore.  Richard E. Grant portrayed Percy as cold & verbally abusive to Marguerite.  Percy ridicules her publically several times -- and Marguerite's dialogue is written so that she never quite ""gives"" as good as she gets.

But Marguerite's dialogue is not the point.  THE POINT is that Percy, in the book, was a tormented man who loved a wife whome he feared he could not trust.  Never once did Grant's acting convey such breadth; his verbal sniping (as written and acted) was cruel and self-aggrandizing.  Even when Percy is supposed to be ""play-acting"" this ridicule of Marguerite in DVD #3 to set up a plot element later in the story, the contempt in the dialogue, as delivered by Grant, felt very REAL.

Screen-writer Carpenter's rendition of the so-called ""romance"" in this movie version touches the very uncomfortable theme of emotional abuse, especially through Grant's interpretation of the dialogue.  Rather than delivering his lines with subtlety (a nod to his hidden feelings of affection for his wife), Grant's Percy most often comes across as a high-handed male autocrat who expects Marguerite to submit meekly to his rule.  While this type of husband/wife relationship may have been historically accurate in 18th Century Britain, I do not believe that the Percy of Orczy's book would have handled himself in this way.  Indeed, Percy was supposed to be the consummate gentleman underneath all the frippery.  And he was supposed to be genuinely in love with his wife.

One of the rare, potentially romantic moments in DVD #1 was completely bungled by both leading actors.  Grant's one-liner about Marguerite being his ""life"" is delivered with such unbelievable dispassion that it borders on mockery.  (And please:  Marguerite's dimwitted mutterings about unrequited love at this crucial point in the plot -- when Percy is accusing her of complicity in a French family's murder -- was INSULTING to every woman of intelligence in the audience! I just wanted to throttle actress McGovern AND the screenwriter.)  Yes, yes, the original book hinged on this ongoing misunderstanding in the Blakeneys' marriage, but the dialogue could have been written and acted much better.

But if you don't consider the lack of plausible romantic elements a good reason to avoid this series, read on.  The problems with this verison of Orczy's Pimpernel go far beyond the love story.

For starters, Percy is often unsympathetic as a human being:  in addition to sniping at his wife and behaving in court like a smart-alecky prig, he shows a dearth of compassion at the death of his loyal lieutenant, Lord Anthony Dewhurst.  When Dewhurst is murdered by Chauvelin (in cold blood, I might add), Grant (and the scriptwriter) devote exactly 3 seconds to grief in DVD #1.  Grant cavalierly delivers the following dialogue: ""Well, Tony knew the risks.""  (And this Pimpernel is supposed to be a hero whom a nation adores?  Whom 20+ young British hotbloods would give up their LIVES for?! Sorry.  Didn't buy it.)

If Percy's casting was bad, Marguerite's was even worse.  In the book, Orczy's Marguerite was a flamboyant French actress, full of life and passion & hopelessly in love with a husband who, she believes in despair, no longer loves her.

In this DVD collection, Elizabeth McGovern most often appears as a frumpy hausfrau rather than a sparkling coquette.  McGovern played Marguerite without wit or common sense, & Carpenter's script didn't help.  For example:  Marguerite (a bourgeois who should have known better) tries to pass herself off at the gates of Paris as a seamstress.  Five seconds later, her lily-white, uncallused hands are inspected by the captain of the guard, and she is hauled off to prison.  Carpenter didn't even let Marguerite's character -- the consummate actress -- PROTEST this treatment, much less run, struggle, or attempt to bluff her way out of her predicament.  Marguerite simply walks off between her guards!!  (::groan::)

In DVD #2, she sits meekly in a convent, waiting for Madame Guillotine's troops to discover her and drag her away.  In DVD #3, she spies on 2 characters, learning the double-identity of the villain.  The villain leaves, but the sidekick remains; several minutes later, Marguerite returns from a chat with Percy to rummage through the villain's belongings.  At this point, neither the actress nor the screenwriter allow Marguerite the common sense to first SEARCH THE AREA FOR THE SIDEKICK to make sure that her snooping goes unobserved.  Naturally, this plot contrivance leads to Marguerite's capture later.  ::double groan::

I could go on and on about the characterization of Marguerite as a stupid female, but I'm sure you get the point.

And now you're probably wondering if there is ANYTHING to commend you to this series.  Well, yes, to be fair, there is:  Martin Shaw, who was cast as Chauvelin.

Shaw portrayed Chauvelin as a real human being with passions, prejudices, longings and yes, moments of real malice.  He also had occasional moments of nobility.  He gave the only consistent performance of real depth in this series.  Even in the scenes where Percy completely humiliated Chauvelin, either by word or by sword, Chauvelin somehow remained sympathetic, which, by contrast, left Percy either looking over-the-top arrogant or a tad bit cruel.

In general, the worst storyline of this series is on DVD #2.  MADAME GUILLOTINE has enough plot contrivances to gag an ox.  The 3rd DVD, THE KIDNAPPED KING, is by far the best of the series -- but, sadly, that isn't saying much.

If you're a glutton for punishment and you really MUST purchase this series, I recommend that you amuse yourself by watching the REALLY BAD ACTING of the extras in the crowd scenes (especially on DVD #1).

However, if you want to watch a REALLY GOOD version of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one that is faithful to Orczy's novel, view the 1980s version that stars Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour.  Andrews is comical AND heroic -- a man to fall in love with.  Seymour is a spunky, resourceful heroine that will make audiences cheer.

You might also enjoy the Leslie Howard version, with beautiful Merle Oberon as Marguerite, which was released in 1935.  Both actors do a credible job with Orczy's characters, and the script is faithful to her book.

Happy viewing!",1126310400,,8438,4.99426523297491
1256717,4,B000031VPF,"When I first watched this movie, I had not yet read the book.  I was confused by the beginning since I did not know the background of how Sir Percy and Lady Marguerite met.  I really think they could have done a better job of introducing all the characters and the storyline.  I was also slightly put off by Elizabeth McGovern and the way they did her hair in several scenes--definitely did not make her beautiful!  Also, I wondered if she was a bit too old for the part.  But as the story progressed and I saw more of the interraction between Marguerite and Percy as well as the excellent acting, I was completely hooked!  Marguerite wasn't just some pretty airhead.  She was smart and resourceful.  All of the other supporting characters were wonderful as well.  Richard E. Grant is superb in this role and I will definitely look for his other films.  Can't wait until season 2 comes out on DVD!",1116288000,,897,4.481481481481482
1256718,4,B000031VPF,"Having read most of the reviews here and on other websites, there seems to be 3 main groups of people checking out this DVD set.
1. Those who love the books and want to see an adaptation of the books.
2. Those who loved the 1982 version (with Andrews and Seymour) and want to see more of that.
3. Those interested in seeing the work of Grant, Shaw, Vibert or McGovern.

Group 1 is generally sorely disappointed.  This version changes the main character of Percy in ways that will be highly discomforting: he uses minimal disquises, he kills people willy-nilly, he uses Bond-esque gadgets instead of wit and cunning, small things like that.  Not to mention, some well loved league members are killed off for no reason.  To see a hilarious list of grievances from Group 1 go to: [...]

Group 2 is generally disappointed too.  That whole love affair/courtship thing between Percy and Marguerite is missing here.  #1 of this DVD starts right off with Percy giving Marguerite the cold shoulder after their marriage.  Group 2 is also upset by the change in Percy (that no disguises and murdering bit).  And then Elizabeth McGovern is not as beautiful (or animated or witty) as Jane Seymour and many in Group 2 are bothered by that.  Group 2 absolutely ADORES Anthony Andrews as Percy, and Grant isn't Andrews.

Group 3 generally really like this DVD set -- especially if they are not burdened by preconceptions of this famous literary story.  However, Group 3 is likely to be a little lost in the beginning.  Note: Percy and Marguerite were madly in love with each other before getting married (you won't believe this when you see the first DVD, but it's true).  On the wedding night, he receives information that she has betrayed some aristocrats.  But he doesn't talk with her to find out what really happened.  That's why their marriage is in need of counseling at the beginning of DVD #1.

When you read the reviews (many from folks in Group 1 and 2), you'll get the impression the acting drags and the screenplay is boring.  This is NOT the case (well, not in #1 and #3).  Personnally I enjoy the tongue-in-cheek take on the Scarlet Pimpernel; the fact that this Pimpernel kills loads of people(!) and walks around in English clothing(!) is hilarious.  Richard Grant has a lot of fun with his role; I like him more and more each time I see these DVDs.  Also Shaw and Vibert plus numerous supporting cast give excellent performances (Shaw in particular is my favorite), the costumes and settings are GREAT, and the script is well-moving and entertaining (especially in #1 and #3 at least).",1109203200,,2587,4.691796008869179

The problem I have is that the scripts do not have too many good lines and they appear to have been written by hacks.

I really like this version. I thought that no one could surpass Anthony Andrews , but , as usual I was wrong. Richard E. Grant is utterly perfect. He can be  a stupid snob while he is Sir Percy and a great, sensible hero when he is the Pimpernel. His performance is elegant, wit and funny.
Elizabeth Mac Govern plays a real Marguerite. Not a stupid, simple woman as others have done before. She was a great actress before her marriage. She has a past and that is why I like her. A real heroine who matches the heroe, not one who is crying all the time and waiting for him to save her.
Martin Shaw is the best Chauvelin. He is a villain, with that dark secret that makes him more human. But also his wicked sense of humor keeps the high level in the film.
And plus, add a great score. A wonderful music with a catchy melody and you have a great serie. BBC always keeping its standars. Let's hope they will going up.",1080432000,,1112,4.265402843601896

I would like to say first, the costumes are terrific, the cinematography is good, but the actors are stuck with questionable lines. That is not to say that the dandies are not dandy and the ladies are not of questionable morrals. I would like nothing more than to recommend this DVD set to friends and strangers alike, but even my Anglophyle friends have not been able to get past the first DVD in this boxset.",1078790400,,574,4.4245283018867925
1256722,2,B000031VPF,"Initially, I couldn't be more thrilled when I heard that there were three new Pimpernel movies out there. I had worn my Anthony Andrews tape almost completely out, all the while hoping that someday, somewhere, someone would get the idea to bring the Pimpernel back. Well, they did. And this is the result. The casting, for the most part, is questionable. Sir Percy is supposed to be dashing and handsome, witty and absolutely hilarious. Richard E. Grant isn't any of these. He's a good actor when he's cast right. Here, he simply isn't. To be fair, he does have a few good moments, but they would have played so much better had it been someone else in the role. Elizabeth McGovern, as Marguerite, is fair. She's pretty, but a few years too old. She has, at least, some of the charm that the role requires. Perhaps the best casting comes in the form of the two villains. Martin Shaw as Chauvelin and Ronan Vibert as Robespierre are excellent. They convey total believeability in their roles. An added diminishment to the overall production is the choices the screenwriters made in adapting the stories. There's adventure and intrigue in places, but sometimes (as in Book Two, ""Mademoiselle Guillotine"") the story drags.
The attention paid to reconstructing the period must be commended. In this version, far more than any other version (yes, even the 1982 one, alas) the viewer gets a real sense of what it was like to live back then. There's the decadence of the English aristocracy and then there's the dirty, dangerous life in revolutionary France.

I have many problems with the film but I will concentrate on the most glaring error.  In all of the Pimpernel books, Sir Percy manages to get the aristocrats out of France in all sorts of witty and devious ways.  None of these ways include running into the room in front of the guards and fighting out.  Also, in all the books I've read, the people who are helping Percy are never caught.  Some are even unaware that they are helping the Scarlet Pimpernel.  It would have been nice if the movie sort of followed the books, but it didn't.",1078012800,,652,4.338842975206612

1256725,4,B000031VPF,"Fans of the book will find a lot to nitpick, and I certainly have, but Richard E. Grant and Elizabeth McGovern are a of a lot of fun to watch.  McGovern gives Marguerite a maturity and intensity that the latest batch of lollipop-actress-models can't even touch, and Grant is always fun.  My only beef is their unkindness to some characters that I was rather fond of (killing them off, even when they survived in the books).
Well, that's not my only beef.  Another one is that, with these characters dying, it would have been nice to see some gravity in Blakeney, recognizing that his friends were dropping like flies to protect him and further his own heroic aims.  Without that maturation, Blakeney seems more like an uncaring airhead than a lighthearted hero.
However, they're fun discs, lots of visual appeal (especially in the first disc, during Mazzarini's birthday party, eh, Lord Dewhurst?), and a great treat for a night in with some hot tea and a purring cat in your lap.",1071792000,,980,4.713450292397661

Dialogue, drama, talent, costumes, casting - this adaptation lacks all of these.  The acting is almost lackluster and bland.  The actors are horribly miscast - I've NEVER seen Elizabeth McGovern look worse (her character is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in Europe,  yet she is the least attractive person on screen).  The clothing is ill-fitting.  The only similarity to the book, are the title and names of the characters.  Their personalities have been almost clownishly redrawn.
I could go on,  but I'm trying to block it out the experience.

I was sooo excited to see it made into a movie (and by A&E, who usually do a very good job of sticking to the book.)  Alright, I know one should not compare literature to cinema, but the book was superb- lacking nothing... romance, action, surprises... It was all there, all A&E had to do was bring it to the screen.  Well, the plot deviates so far from the book that it's painful.  All the amazing disguises and clever tricks that Pimpernel used to rescue the aristocrats... GONE!  And they were replaced by mediocrity.  And then Margurite's character was completely wrong!  I was upset to say the least.  It had the makings of a classic but failed terribly.  Even if I could have gotten past the fact that it wasn't anything like the book I still have to say that it wasn't a good movie.  I wasn't draw to the characters or their plight at all.  It had little feeling... very surfacy.  There is a much better 1982 version with Jane Seymore that is more faithful to the book.  Of course, it too has its flaws and gets lots of things mixed around... but Anthony Andrews does an excellent job as Pimpernel and the plot is not as wholly rewritten as it is in this newer version.  My advice to you is to read the book and then watch the 1982 version!  Skip this one!!!",1067731200,,1342,4.354838709677419
1256729,3,B000031VPF,"Richard E. Grant is a marvelous actor and I have no fault with him or most of the cast for these made for TV films.
My major complaint with these films is that they are ALL lacking the most important element of the Scarlet Pimpernel's career. His ability to do a disguise better than anyone alive! As the first true super hero ever writtten it is an esential part of his character! And NOT ONCE do they use this key ability of his! Well they do have him wear a cape and have nifty devices sewn into his clothes but IMHO you just cannot leave out his diguise abilities!
My other complaint is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Margaritte..she was very dull and not at all the exciting or intelligent person she is supposed to be. Look at Jane Seymour in the 1982 version for the best Margaritte as well as some excellent disguises done by Anthony Andrews as the excellent SP himself.
I enjoy this new version well enough, mostly becasue REG and the actor who plays Chauvelin are both sooooo good. But as a whole the 1982 version and the recent Broadway Musical capture the most important aspects of TSP and are worth seeing if you have the chance! I believe the musical is no longer running but the soundtracks (2 of them)are worth getting they tell the story quite well and are delightful!",1042675200,,1291,4.451476793248945

Those interested in the French Revolution will be tickled to hear ""ca ira"" played throughout the first episode.  They will also enjoy the actor who plays the diabolical Robespierre, his dead eyes and foppish attire seem to capture the essence of the Incorruptible.

So who is this short balding dude who insults his wife in public, stabs people, and is absolutely, positively irritating? He's not the Pimpernel except, Oh GAWD!, he is! What the devil was A&E thinking? Did anyone actually read the books before they wrote these scripts?
Every character in this whole stupid A&E series was totally wrong. They all were about 10 years older than they were supposed to be, but what's more is that their personalities were totally wrong as well. If you want a good Pimpernel movie, try the 1982 version with Anthony Andrews as Percy. He was too perfect and way too cute as Sir Percy! Jane Seymour also played a lovely Lady Blakeney and Sir Ian Mckellan was the absolute epitome of the villian Chauvlin. Or, if you're an old movie fan, try the 1934 Scarlet Pimpernel movie with Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon. Oberon was better as Marguerite than Jane Seymour even was. Leslie Howard's preformance (while not as good as Anthony Andrews's) was excellent as well. His transitions from fop to hero were masterful.",1026691200,,1187,4.852216748768473
1256733,4,B000031VPF,"Generally I'm a fan of the Anthony Andrews version, which I think is the most consistently good, but this was the first Pimpernel I saw, and I found it very entertaining.
Richard E. Grant is charming and hilarious--as usual.  It's nice to see this unlikliest-of-leading-men get to play a hero for once, and he carries it off with style.  I like Elizabeth McGovern's performance, but I think the costume and wig person should be shot for what they did to her.  Martin Shaw is charismatic as Chauvelin.
However, the one place where this version rises above all other adaptations is in the casting of Robespierre.  Ronan Vibert is incredibly talented, making Robespierre a perfect combination of creepy villain and dandy.  Lines like ""I do like the buttons"" (referring to the guillotine motif on his new jacket) will have you snickering hours afterwards, while he conveys real menace with his delivery of ""Don't cut me again citizen.""  What a performance.  Let's hope we see considerably more of Mr. Vibert in the future.
The script quality varies somewhat.  The third episode is the strongest, the second the weakest (bar one hilarious scene of mixed identity) and the first a decent introduction.  There are fun cameos from Jamie Bamber, Suzanne Bertish, and Dominic Mafham, who dies in the first five minutes of episode one.

1256734,5,B000031VPF,"This may well be my favorite version of the Scarlet Pimpernel.  I had always adored the 1934 version with Leslie Howard.  Richard Grant does not merely reprise Howard, he rethinks the character of the Pimpernel.
The Howard version, done at a time when England was under attack by Germany, is solidly patriotic.  Howard's Pimpernel is a patriot and a humanitarian.  Richard Grant's Pimpernel obviously enjoys the thrill seeking, living on the edge of destruction.  As someone else said, an adrenalin junkie.  Rescuing aristos from the guillotine is an extreme sport for him.
Lady Blakeney is played as an older character, about mid thirties, rather than 25, as in the book, which is delightful.  She is more experienced, less an ingenue, and her mistakes arise from desperation, not pique.  When they relax together, she and Sir Percy obviously enjoy one another, physically and mentally.
Which brings me to the character of Chauvelin.  His character is given more depth.  There's hints about his character that need to be explored in more depth (could we have another movie or two, please?.  He reminded me of Raphael Sabatini's Scaramouche, a middle class character who was drawn into the Revolution without a full understanding of what he was helping to set in motion.  However, make no mistake, Chauvelin is looking out for himself first and foremost.
France of the Revolution is shown to be a madhouse, where the Guillotine is an icon, sculpture of the heads of the fallen becoming decorations in a coffeehouse.  It is both horridly decadent and fascinatingly stylish.

I say ""might"", because your opinions of this version will definitely be colored by your attachment to the other versions and their leads.  I came to this video, having only seen the 1934 version a long time ago, and I watched all three versions within one week.
First, the reviewers are right in identifying both the merits and faults of this version.  This is a way-out adaptation of the story, so much so, that you might not recognize the story as the original one written by Baroness Orczy. Having said this, I have to add that the way-out factor consists not so much of added scenes and characters (which the 1982 version has), but of the change in the character of the Pimpernel and the emphasis on him as a man-of-action, rather than a fop or a devoted husband.  There are also some major characters (in the series) bumped off either in the first episode or in subsequent episodes.
If you are going to watch this, watch it as a historical romp updated for the 1990s and as a cross between the original Pimpernel and the action movies and commando movies so popular today.
Also keep in mind that the romance factor (crucial in the book and in earlier versions) is reduced to practically zero, thanks to the screenplay and the palpable lack of chemistry between the leads (not to mention the miscasting of Marguerite). The most passion Sir Percy displays for his wife is when he is trying to outrun the mob to get to her.  [The prison scene, starting with him descending the steps down to this frantic race is one of my favorite clips in this movie].
As for Marguerite, she displays more feeling for her brother than for her husband or her former lover.  Which former lover? Ah, you have to watch the movie to find that out, as well as the peculiar interpretation of her past in this version.
Watch for Ronan Vibert's Robespierre and for Grant's varied smiles which convey different meanings.  His best film is said to be WITHNAIL AND I, which I will certainly look out for.
Yes, this version has a lot of things wrong with French history - but so does the 1982 version.  This is *not* the film to watch to find out more about the revolution, even though it may be a cult favorite in AP History classes.  My problems are not so much with the history as introduced in this version (the film after all is about a fictional character, to begin with), or with the departures from the story - but with the lack of romantic passion (crucial in the original story), and the many unexplained puzzles (such as a) why would Sir Percy trust an actress of dubious morals, b) why would no Parisian notice men walking around in masks, and c) who informed on a French sympathizer who was guillotined).

I was a bit disappointed in it, however, because of how far it strayed from the spirit of the original stories.  The Sir Percy of the novels relied on his cunning and wit to get out of sticky situations rather than killing a bunch of people (even if they deserved it) as in these three films.  That is really my main complaint, but I have a few others.  The character of Chauvelin is different.  Here he is bad, yet conflicted.  In the novels he is just plain bad.  He shows an obsessive lust for revenge, but in these films he just seems really miffed.  Having said that, I think Martin Shaw played the character well for the way that it was written. Chauvelin's sidekick, Fumier, is annoying and unnecessary.  Although, it was probably easier to have one guy helping him throughout all three films rather than having different people, as happens in the different novels.  I thought Richard E. Grant was decent.  He could have been better, I think, if the role had been interpreted better.  He also doesn't fit the physical profile of Sir Percy, but that could be overlooked if the role was more like the original character.  As for Elizabeth McGovern, she really lacked the passion that the role of Marguerite needed.  Finally, I really wish that the French characters would have used French accents.  Or at least tried to. Now it's time for the good things about these films.  They are beautifully shot, and worth watching just for the cinematography.  There are some fun fencing scenes, which are always a plus.  The musical score is also quite good.  I really like Anthony Green's performance as Sir Andrew.  I thought it was really well done, just the way that I pictured Andrew.  I did think he would make a better Sir Percy than Grant, especially since he actually does fit the physical profile.  Last but not least (and the reason I wrote this review), the best performance in the movies, in my opinion, was that of Ronan Vibert as Robespierre, especially in the third film.  He played the part exactly as I'm sure Baroness Orczy had him in her mind.  He gives the character that soft-spoken viciousness that makes others cower before him, even though he perhaps isn't a physically frightening figure.  Plus, he perfectly does the ""mirthless smile"" bit that Orczy was always writing about.  True, it was a relatively small role, but Vibert's performance was the definite standout, with Green coming second.  Pay attention to their performances if you watch these. The bottom line is that this film is fun to watch if you like a good swashbuckler.  If you are looking for a film that has a better interpretation of the book, watch the version with Leslie Howard.  Actually, watch it anyway.  If you want a lavish, beautifully filmed version that may not quite get all the details right, watch these movies.  They aren't the best, but they are fun.",982972800,,2997,4.7057692307692305
1256744,2,B000031VPF,"This is one of my very favorite stories--a real adventure and love story that has plenty of surprises. Unfortunately, this making of the Scarlet Pimpernel is dry and played without passion on the political, adventurous, AND romantic scenes.
I would love to have the newer version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour. It's a great flick that is also good for a ""Blockbuster Night"" with your significant other.",978652800,,410,5.044117647058823
1256745,5,B000031VPF,"Clearly, Baroness Orczy's original fictional character, ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", and film adaptations such as the 1934 version starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon, each stand alone. The 1998 BBC/A&E  co-production is neither docudrama nor a faithful reproduction of the  original works--it is a new interpretation of a favourite fictional  character set in the French Revolution. Much criticism of this miniseries  is ungenerous, and misses many of its finer points--in addition, in one  case, to confusing Elizabeth McGovern with Elizabeth Montgomery.
This is  a very long piece of work--far exceeding Hitchcock's famous bladder test,  if any zealot is contemplating a viewing in one sitting. That box contains  five hours of viewing on three DVDs! Yet it sustains its high production  values and story interest throughout, and is unusual among miniseries for  doing so. Glorious locations in the Czech Republic; sumptuous, moody and  squalid interiors as required; and first class costuming and property  department, are combined with superb direction, photography, editing,  sound, and acting.
Elizabeth McGovern is physically not the first actress  one would think of casting as Lady Marguerite Blakeney. But like the highly  skilled stage actress she is, Ms McGovern carries her role less on  appearance than on technique. She weaves a credible romantic  characterisation based on shared experience, intrigue, intellectual  respect, and even a bit of physicality. She is well-matched with a strong  cast also rich in stage background, including Richard E. Grant in the title  role, Martin Shaw as the ruthless and complex Chauvelin, Ronan Vibert as  Robespierre, and many other fine performers.
""The Scarlet  Pimpernel"" (1998) boxed set is fantastic value, comparable as a high  quality costume drama to only one other miniseries currently in DVD,  ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" (1999) with Gerard Depardieu. If you  saw and liked them on TV, they are even better on DVD.",960595200,,1978,5.470198675496689
1256746,2,B000031VPF,"This is one of my favorite stories, but the two leading actors in this DVD are terrible. Elizabeth Montgomery is a pretty woman, but she moves through this film like a cow. Richard Grant just isn't cut out to the Scarlet Pimpernel. Mr. Grant is a great character actor so he plays the disguised  Percy moments well, but he is not a good leading man, so he really can't  get the ""real"" Percy right. I love him when he plays sly,  sniveling rodents, not ""the HERO.""
I... suggest to whomever has the power to do so  that they bring back the great version of the Scarlet Pimpernel produced in  the 1980's and make it into a DVD.  Sir Anthony Andrews (Brideshead  Revisited) played the Scarlet Pimpernel to perfection. His lady love  Marguerite was played by Jane Seymour (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman). The  chemistry between these two actors was downright steamy..though they never  removed their clothes. The scoundrel St. Just was played by the wonderful  Sir Ian McKellan (Gods and Monsters). McKellan oozed evil and yet compelled  sympathy not unlike that of Sir Lawrence Olivier playing Richard III.
The  story takes place in the late 1700's during the Reign of Terror when the  French Revolution rolled out of control. Sir Percy, an English aristocrat  (Andrews)is seen by most as a ""foppish gentleman"" who cares only  for his appearance, but his close friends know the truth. Percy uses  numerous disguises to cover his identity as he breaks the law and rescues  French aristocrats from the guillotine. The real Percy is charming, his  swordplay fantabulous and his identity as the Scarlet Pimpernel hidden from  Marguerite on their wedding day when he discovers she has betrayed a French  aristocrat to the Revolution.
This tale is a real bodice-buster..when it  is cast properly.",959385600,,1781,4.906040268456376
1256747,2,B000031VPF,"Whenever people review a movie based on a book, they seperate into two distinct groups. 1- Those who love the book and are disappointed and 2- Those who have not read the book and love the movie. I will try to write a  review that will help everyone.
I am a Scarlet Pimpernel fan. I was happy  to hear about the new videos and bought the set. I must say that as a fan,  I was let down. As a movie fan, I found them to be tolerable. The pros and  cons of the movies:
Tape 1-
SP Fan- The plot was of course mangled but  one comes to accept that as a given in any SP adaptation. Ms. McGovern was  not as vile an actress as I expected. The villains are well played.  However, I found the utter change in the tone of the books to be  distressing. In the books, the SP would come up with a brilliant and  usually non-violent rescue. In the movie, they kick down doors, hack  through anyone who gets in their way and generally make like a SWAT team.  Once again, Marguerite and Chauvelin are made out to be ex-lovers, never in  the book by the way. This is not giving away key plot points: Lord Tony is  quickly killed! Lord Tony who survived a dozen SP books killed and  forgotten about!
Non-SP- Okay historic adventure. The costumes are good,  the acting is solid. Robespierre is especially good. Too violent. The  ""get a room"" factor is high. Worth a rent, not a buy.
Tape  2-
SP- Better than the first anyway. The arguments between our favorite  married couple are cute. Again, not true to the tone of the books. The  villainess is quite good though. How did Marguerite's hair grow back so  quickly? Would they really have allowed her a wig in prison? I think  not!
Non-SP- Interesting relationships. The priest's plight was truly  moving. I loved the part where Sir Percy pretends to be his arch-enemy!  Still, there are better films in this genre.
Tape 3-
SP- The best of  the lot and probably the only one worth buying. The writing becomes very  predictable and I guessed a key suprise three minutes into the movie.  Still, the vallains are good. I must agree with the review below that Sir  Percy would never kill anyone like he did in this one. Too contrived an  ending.
Non-SP- The best of the lot. Some good suprises, some cliches but  overall moderately enjoyable. Check out Errol Flynn for better examples of  swashbuckling.
In conclusion, Lord Tony's death distressed me greatly.  The writer obviously wanted to prove that he was not afraid to kill main  characters. He had already killed a league member at the beginning! Was he  not satisfied? Lord Tony is the son of a Duke for heaven's sake! Do you  actually believe the French could murder him in broad daylight in public in  front of 200 witnesses and get away with it? It would cause a diplomatic  nightmare. Anyway, since they knew he was not the SP, why did they not  ransom him back? They are low on cash, remember. That's the way with these  movies. They make changes and then do not support them with facts and  aftermath.
SP- 1 star None-SP- 3 stars

1256748,5,B000031VPF,The Scarlett Pimpernel is a top-notch miniseries equiped with everthing a great romance needs.  A little adventure and a dancing scene.

1256749,5,B000031VPF,"The best Pimpernel of the series. Plenty of action,mystery and love. Richard E. Grant is the perfect Sir Percy. The complete foppish dandy but also the perfect romantic hero. He gets to use his clever wit not only with  his wife but also with Suzanne Bertish, as the new totaly unlikeable Madame  Tourain/Chevier D'Orly. He also gets to show his senstive side with the  dauphin. Elizabeth McGovern isn't the best Marguerite, but here shows her  complete love for Sir Percy, by risking her life for him and carries it off  very well. Martin Shaw, the best of Chauvelins,is perfect. Although, he  never catches of to Percy's intentional misprouncing of his name. I've seen  this so many times, I think I know most of the dialogue.",951782400,,728,4.776
1256750,5,B000031VPF,"I'm a great picker of historical nits and I found very little to pick here.  Richard E. Grant drives every scene he is in with his somewhat manic, adrenalin-junkie rendition of the Pimpernel.  It was quite fun to  see him played as a less than perfect-- but very lucky-- risk taker.  One  caveat-- although some of the broad outlines are there, this one wanders  far from its source.
I did say that the second one was weak. It was  like they got to near the end of the movie, realized they didn't have time  to resolve the interesting situation they had set up, so they threw up  their hands, killed some characters and everyone else escaped on horseback.  Disappointing in the same movie where Richard E. Grant (disquised as a  French agent) grows more and more hilariously indignant as a Revolutionary  official admits to ignorance of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
I certainly hope  there are more as long as they can keep up these high standards.",947721600,,942,4.636363636363637

''When I can enjoy the embraces of the man I adore''
''Away with all doubts and fears!''
''Come to me, my love''
''The trees will shelter us from prying eyes''
''And I shall give you my heart''

This is the opening scene. Why?
What moment? (The Revolution!)
Cast away doubts! (Trust Robespierre!)
We shall be hidden! (horrible things)
I shall give you (Robespierre) my heart

This drama is outstanding in presenting, explaining and showing the horrors of the French Revolution. Robespierre is the central character. The 'committee of public safety' is shown many times, deciding, considering and after all - submitting to Robespierre.

This work, especially the first disc, focuses on the political motives in France and the humanitarian motives of the scarlet pimpernel. The contrast, human feeling against abstract ideas, is vividly drawn.

Another contrast is the silly English king vs the arrogant, intellectual Robespierre. The frivolous English aristocratic Percy (the pimpernel) and his hidden courage. These cultural worlds are finely drawn. I think they are really the purpose of the stories. This is a nineteenth century drama. The writer is teaching more than entertaining.

The tensions, the conflicts, the old lovers, the new challenges, the misjudgements, the reconciliations, the threats, all add interest.

The other star is not a person, but a machine. The guilletine. This machine in action plays a key role in the story. The cruel, heartless, cold, condemnation of ordinary people, creates disgust with this New France.

The issues of integrity, betrayal, endurance, all are developed.

What will each do?

Elizabeth is put on trial, for her life, by Robespierre. Will she die? Why did she reject the Revolution after supporting it originally? Her speech . . .

''I believed in the Revolution but I have watched it turn into a holocaust. This week in the prisons over a thousand people have been murdered.''
''You wanted it.''

This direct challenge to the leaders of the French Revolution seems to be the essence of the drama.

There are differences.  There are always differences, but it is unequivocally clear to me that Mr. Grant steals the show.  The woman playing Marguerite...less so.  She is strong and capable in her own right, and I like that, but there is no real chemistry between her and Grant, which is such a pity.  That is one of the most important aspects of this story.
