4990030,2,B006HH629S,"It seemed like a light hearted look at women's breasts from the title and cover, but actually quickly turned into a self conscious, over narrated political piece. The points the filmmaker made re: breast feeding, breast cancer and breast augmentation, were all valid, but just wasn't what I was expecting.",1370044800,,305,5.12
4990031,2,B006HH629S,"There isn't really much to learn in this documentary.  I was interested and quite puzzled  to hear a female academic explain how American males' attraction to breasts is learned and not natural.  It was even further explained that if we American men were taught to be attracted to a woman's elbow, that would not only sexually arouse us, but American women would find a man's touch of their elbow sexually stimulating.  About half of the people chosen for interviews were simply poor choices which is too bad because this could have been a really interesting topic for a documentary.  And finally, this documentary covered breast feeding in public, breast feeding in general, the history of breast-size fashion, the anxiety of puberty and having to purchase a bra for the first time, breasts as a sexual body part, men are pigs when it comes to breasts, the problems with having too large breasts, the problems with having too small breasts, elective breast augmentation surgery, breast cancer survival, mastectomies, at least two classic, ""My eyes are up here,"" references, a visit to Hooters, and concludes with a visit to a burlesque show that looks an awful lot like really bad late night community theater, all in less than an hour. They should have chopped the subject matter in half and spent a little more time with the specific subjects they really wanted to address.  I think most women will enjoy this simply because they will agree with the subject matter and can relate to it, but there is little to learn here.",1369267200,2,1524,4.842307692307692
4990032,3,B006HH629S,It was well done with the limited budget it had. A good watch when you need to pass the time.,1368230400,,93,3.7
4990033,4,B006HH629S,"The gal doing the documentary had her mother die of cancer of the bosom when the gal was young, the mom was 36 and it was just not talked about at that time.  When the gal began to develop and needed a bra at age 9 she figured the cancer was coming for her.

So, perhaps she made this to come to grips with her own mortality.  She asks 'Why are folks obcessed?' She attends a Tom Likus radio show where he has a 'Flash 'em Friday' portion of his show.  He looks really dumb, sitting comfortably in a radio studio encouraging women to bare themselves while he is safely entombed.

She says a study was done (in 1951) looking at 190 cultures and found that only 13 of the cultures found the bosom enticing.  There are a couple shots of some somewhat bare women in Africa. Mentions that other cultures value other body parts, such as tiny feet, ankles, and knees.

At one point we kinda see a gal getting increase surgery, this whole thing is like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Size-Me/dp/B008SYTU06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Size Me</a>.

Some paintings are shown, showing bosom, says that in the late 1800's formula was developed and that encouraged women to not nurse their babies.  Says hospitals give away formula and the hospitals get paid to do that by formula makers.  Hmm. Mentions October is awareness month.

She tries to talk to folks in their 60's about bosom, none seem interested in talking.  One gal may have to have removal surgery and asks her husband how he would feel about her then.

The camera goes with a young girl to buy her first bra, an odd experience, she will have one for the rest of her life.

There are clips of pin-up girls and the guys in WWII who were fighting so they could return to see...girls.

Mammary is the base for the word mammal, I wonder if it is also the source of ma am.

There are photos of women who had removal and some talk, some have replacement part that they show.

She visits a burlesque, pasties.

At the end she exposes herself, not to the camera.  Made in memory of her mom. Hmm. Insightful, something to ponder.  I personally think it is due to where initial nurishment comes from is why we are interested.",1357603200,5,2221,4.660668380462725
4990054,2,B006HH629S,boring for a potentially intriguing socio-political film. I've seen better on similar topics.,1441670400,,93,6.230769230769231
4990055,4,B006HH629S,"A very well done documentary. Focusing on women and how they feel about their breasts and the way they are viewed around the world. Tiny feet are more enticing to the male in some cultures, other the derriere is the focus but in America men focus the breasts. Very informative and I opened my eyes to many facts I ignored before.",1438560000,,329,4.409836065573771
4990056,3,B006HH629S,"It was a slightly amateurish investigation into the U.S. male obsession with the female breast. The conclusion was that this was contrived as in history men were obsessed with ankles etc. she quoted a survey that only a minority of cultures viewed breasts as erogenous zones. Numerically maybe but in Greek, Roman, Indian, Japanese and other cultures the young female breast is an art form an object of sexual desire",1424390400,,416,4.957142857142857

4990059,4,B006HH629S,educational but not stuffy and clinical!  mature but not explicit.  frank but not rude.  will look for more movies like this.,1401148800,4,125,4.857142857142857
4990060,3,B006HH629S,"I may have used the same headline for my review of another short film on America's views of female breasts, BREASTS: A DOCUMENTARY, which came out eight years before this 2004 title, BUSTING OUT.  BREASTS focused on interviews with about two-dozen women of all shapes and sizes talking about their bosoms.  BUSTING OUT centers on one of its filmmakers, Francine Strickwerda, whose feelings about her breasts surprise her as much as her development at age 9 did.  By then she had lost her mother to breast cancer.  Between that tragedy, the taboo of the word ""breast"" in those days (mid-1970s), and the hostility this aspect of womanhood seems to draw from men and even some women in her adult life, Strickwerda wants to speak about it to, well, anybody willing to appear on camera.

In BUSTING OUT Francine Strickwerda talks to - well, whom she talks to is, in a way, besides the point.  That she wants to ask why people too often express their feelings about breasts in antisocial ways is what matters.  Why do men show their attraction to a woman's top as if it's found money?  How come well-built or not-so-well-built women are ridiculed by other women, let alone immature men?  If we're going to grow up and get past all this, BUSTING OUT seems to say, we have to start talking.",1395014400,2,1282,4.662222222222222
4990061,1,B006HH629S,"I watched this film as part of a Cultural Anthropology course.  As I told Professor Mihm, you have to take a film like this with a grain of salt.  As I told him, look at all the women in the movie complaining about the sexual aspects of the woman breast. Do you notice one thing about all of them?

Overall I have to say this movie is a flop, not so much as I disagree with what it is saying, but it says it in a poorly done, poorly written, and is rather bland and boring/",1394582400,,473,3.90625
4990062,1,B006HH629S,This show is nothing about nothing. It is neither scientific or entertaining. I didn't watch but half before i was dozing and skipping thru the remaining portion to see if it offered anything at all. I wish I could rate it a -1.,1391385600,,228,4.325581395348837
4990063,1,B006HH629S,"Opened up the film, but then stopped fairly quickly.  Did not catch my interest, so did not waste my time watching.",1389657600,,115,4.476190476190476
8498401,5,B006HH629S,"It was very enlightening to see this topic from a woman's viewpoint, since as a guy i walk around every day with my own view of breasts. I really enjoyed the cultural and historical facts that were discussed, like the studies done showing that only 13 our of 190 countries/cultures think of breasts as sexual like we do in the US. The one study was old though, so it would be interesting to see if/how its changed in a current study. Also good point on how our minds can adapt to basically think anything on a woman is sexy/a turn on. Like the Japanese culture it mentions used to wrap up their daughters feet as infants so they would have small feet as an adult to help them marry a wealthier..etc man since their male culture saw small feet as the big turn on.",1508803200,,762,4.298611111111111

8498404,5,B006HH629S,"Very well-done documentary on our cultural framework for women's breasts.  What was most moving was not the supposed focus on men's sexual obsession, but on women's more complex relationship not only to their own breasts but also to the social expectations for that relationship.  I saw it on prime but liked it so much I'll be buying my own copy on DVD to support the director and to loan it to friends.",1485043200,,404,4.597222222222222
