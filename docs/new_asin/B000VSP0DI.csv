2951334,5,B000VSP0DI,I was going through the movies in Warner Archives and was really surprised to see this Guy Williams movie available. I got mine from them directly and even with a few imperfections this was an incredibly nice copy good color and sound not like those previously offered on amazon that are so washed out..If you are a Guy Williams fan I urge you to order this from Warner Archives so you can really enjoy the movie now they have also released Captain Sinbad with a decent transfer to really enjoy these rare Guy Williams films.

2951335,4,B000VSP0DI,"With the box office success of Producer Joseph E. Levine's Italian import of Director Pietro Francisci's 'HERCULES' aka 'LE FATICHE DI ERCOLE'- 1959 and the Oscar blowout (11 to be exact and still the champ) of Director William Wyler's 'BEN-HUR'- 1959, the sword and sandal genre utilizing myths and legends started to merge with the biblical epic such as Director Richard Fleischer's 'BARABBAS'- 1962 and Director Robert Aldrich's 'SODOM AND GOMORRAH' -1963 to name but a few.  Here we have an Italian American co-production,  Director Curtis Bernhardt's 'DAMON AND PYTHIAS' aka 'IL TIRANNO DI SYRACUSA'-1962 which falls into this category successfully bringing the legend to film but suffering from lacklustre performances and bad casting.  The film stars two American actors from heavy television work: Guy Williams riding high from his 'ZORRO' series and yet to make a splash as head of the Robinson family in the 60's series 'LOST IN SPACE' and Don Burnett who graced the series 'HAWAIIAN EYE' and 'BONANZA' as the Greek dynamic duo.  The great Arnoldo Foa supplies the villainy as Dionysius who hopes to destroy any beliefs that may threaten his rule.  Enter the friendship and honor of our titled characters which helps destroy that idea.  With an above average script by Bridget Boland and Samuel Marx , inspired cinematography from the great Aldo Tonti and a beautiful score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, the film never becomes more than an above average ride due to the lame performances of its leads and actress Ilaria Occhini.  Fans will recognize the beautiful Marina Berti and Liana Orfei who raise the level just a bit but not much. Its surprising because Director Bernhardt was a director of many successful woman's picture in the forties. Warner Archive has been giving action fans many rare titles this month and releases it in a beautiful DVD-R in its correct aspect ratio of 1.85 with no extras so you can throw away your inferior budget DVD's or use them as coasters. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, it's just one of those films that you wish would get better as you watch but it never quite gets there.",1348099200,2,2130,4.932960893854749

8219790,3,B000VSP0DI,"Phytias is this bleeding heart liberal socialist from Athens who goes to Syracuse to find the Karl Marx character who fathered his we are all brothers, love your brother, violence is never the answer philosophy. Syracuse is ruled by Ultra conservative, right wing neo Nazi, King Dionysius, who believes in a strict interpretation of the constitution. Getting involved with them is Damon, a libertarian who thinks government should stay out of people's lives and only wants to get what he can get. His philosophy is, you're on your own, pal. Good luck. There are some other things going on. Phythias has a pregnant wife who almost dies from depression. Damon has a faithful girlfriend and the King has a young son he is teaching how to rule, preferably as a heartless conservative. The movie was mildly entertaining until about the one hour mark when I thought I was going to cry. This movie is a story about real friendship. This is self sacrificing noble, expecting nothing in return friendship. Damon puts his life on the line for the only real friend he has ever had. Phythias does the same and in the end, the King of Syracuse proves to be the ultimate politician with one of the great lines I have ever heard in a movie. Okay, low budget and at times sappy but a truly great story. The wife of Pythias is awesome in her final scene and Guy Williams must have been thinking Oscar when his girlfriend was demanding he do something to help Pythias. I give the movie three stars because it was done on the cheap and some of the acting was not the greatest to say the least, but I thought it was worth watching.",1493683200,,1611,4.558620689655172

Instead, it was simply one of those ""wooden"" performances featuring an American t.v. star of the mid-1960's, Guy Williams, whose only big role,was as ""Zorro.""

This was like a bad ""spaghetti western"" which vaguely followed the outline of the old Greek legend.",1393977600,,389,4.878787878787879
