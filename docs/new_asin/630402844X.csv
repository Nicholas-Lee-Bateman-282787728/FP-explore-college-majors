7861170,5,630402844X,"The best way to prove the measure of an episode's greatness is its ability to change someone's opinion about an entire series and genre.  That's what happened with my wife.  At the time the original TNG episodes were running, we were dating and she couldn't understand why I had to catch my TNG on Saturday evenings.  Science Fiction and TNG in particular were the last thing she thought she would ever appreciate...until...

One fateful evening after having received enough ribbing about watching TNG re-runs, I noticed in the TV guide that this episode was coming on.  Our local UPN affiliate was even kind enough to run the 'Q Who?' episode first, then BoBW pt. 1 and 2 all together.  I knew this was my best chance to change her mind, so I had her sit through the 'Q Who?' just to set the scene of who the Borg were, and then we watched BoBW pt. 1.  After the scene of Picard saying 'Resistance is futile', my wife was hooked on Trek!

To this day, she thinks Picard rules the world.  Just my two cents on an episode that was truly, truly, the turning point of TNG and Trek as a whole.",1131408000,,1089,4.378109452736318
7861171,5,630402844X,"This pivotal two-parter, for those of you just back from Mars, entailed Capt. Picard's capture and assimilation by the Borg, the cybernetic creatures.  The action in these episodes revolves around the Enterprise crew's efforts to destroy the Borg and retrieve Capt. Picard.
However, the writers passed up a stupendous opportunity to portray life as it can and ought to be.  When the Enterprise crew was attacked by the Borg, Worf and the others responded by trying to kill them (and they kept trying, though the Borg could adapt to every weapon employed).
What if the Enterprise crew had, after the first attack, asked itself, ""Why do they hate us?""  The Enterprise folks should have spent a substantial amount of time analyzing which of their own failings and misdeeds were instrumental in provoking the Borg attack.  Capt. Picard should have then formed a coalition, perhaps engaging the United Nations, and sent representatives to negotiate with the Borg.  Resolutions could have been passed, and inspectors sent to ensure that the Borg complied with the resolutions.  The Enterprise crew could have been FAR more compassionate, diverse, tolerant and inclusive toward the Borg -- but instead, they just tried to kill them, and neutralize the threat.  They acted without regard for how other planets might have felt about them.  They simply wanted to destroy the Borg, and end the threat.
That doesn't sound like enlightened space travelers.  It sounds like a bunch of unilateral cowboys.  They prevailed over the Borg attackers, but that's beside the point.  They should have been more gentle, more tolerant, more diverse and understanding in their dealings with the Borg terrorists.  They should have appeased them.  That would have taught those Borg a lesson, all right.",1067299200,7,1775,5.164335664335664
7861172,5,630402844X,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?One of the best-if not THE best TNG episodes ever. Even if you're a casual sci-fi fan,I'd wager that you'll really like this one. Of course,if you know the history leading up to the episode,and the repercussions that come if future episodes,that makes it even better!!I cannot wait until these seasons are out on DVD!!",1017360000,,363,4.777777777777778
7861173,5,630402844X,This is the BEST Star Trek The Next Generation show I every watched.  Who ever reads this THIS IS A MUST GET television show to get if you are a Trekkie...,1016150400,,155,4.0
7861174,5,630402844X,"Okay, I raise my hands in admittance, I'm  a Babylon 5 fan, not a Star Trek fan. But before you hurl injurous objects at me  and assault me outmoded farming implements let me say that there is more than enough room  on TV for both of them. There, let us stop bickering and stop sulking B5  fans.
This is the best Star Trek. The idea behind the Borg is horrific.  They just keep on coming. Healing within seconds and constantly adapting  they are a terrible foe to whom the galaxy probably belongs in the future.  Against them they have The USS Enterprise and it's highly skilled (and  highly flukey) crew. The best thing about this two parter is that the Borg  make all the right moves. They do nothing stupid that allows the federation  gain the upper hand, they are ready for anything the good guys can throw at  them. This obviously has Starfleet on the run and for a while it looks like  the Borg are going to win this one. The assimilation of Picard (played by  the stupendously ace Jean Luc Picard, who is the best actor around  currently, and not because he comes from my home town, nyaah rasp) is  genuinely chilling and the calmness of the Borg as they attack is  unnerving. The Borg are indeed the best villains ever!
There are a  couple of flaws with this though. The massacre of Starfleet isn't shown  which is quite damning considering if they did it would be the dramatic  equivilent of whacking friend viewer around the back of the head by a two  by four. Also everything after the show returns to good old hunky dory.  Bah. More psychological scars and long term consequences next time, please!  Still, it is exciting and the acting is of a high standard. It is the  equivilent to Babylon 5's 'Coming of Shadows' and 'The Long Twilight  Struggle'. Only in those two the good guys lose. Nyuk nyuk.
The main  problem is that now the new Star Treks have squandered the Borg  shamelessly. They have junked everything that made them chilling,  introducing individuality (see well done but conceptually wrong Borg queen  and Hugh) and those bloody 'Quantum torpedoes' which gives Starfleet a  handy excuse for taking on cubes and winning. And now they've introduced a  more powerful enemy... which they beat by using technobabble! Aiee! Bring  back the grim nightmare of proper Borg. Anyway, buy this and enjoy.",957139200,2,2321,4.628992628992629
