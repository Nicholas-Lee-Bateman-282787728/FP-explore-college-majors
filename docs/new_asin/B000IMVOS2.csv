8146380,5,B000IMVOS2,"John Stossel should be called the ""Dragnet"" of journalism, his no nonsense and ""just the facts m'am"" approach to things makes this dvd worth watching. As you watch this video there will be times you will be tempted to start talking to yourself with comments like ""I knew that!"", ""after all the arguments mom was wrong!"", ""how can that be, I got cold and then got the flu!"". This video will show you statistics and eyewitnesses to explain the everyday myths, lies and straight talk that is part of our daily life.

Critics may try to dispute the facts and Stossel's sources. This video is a good source to students to understand critical thinking. I highly recommend this video for teachers and parents. Very educational and MAKES you do some THINKING about comments and ideas others want you to believe is true.

Stossel did an ABC special years ago called Junk Science, too bad I don't see that dvd available. That video shows you how science can be manipulated to convince people they are right.",1219190400,6,997,4.691428571428571
