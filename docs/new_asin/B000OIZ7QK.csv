8185399,4,B000OIZ7QK,"One of the best documentaries I've seen on Alaskan wildlife, this video shows bears, moose, and many other animals living in their wild habitat. It also shows the people who live in that state and their distinctive lifestyles.  The Time-Life Nature Video series was something of very good quality in its time, but it would be interesting to see all that beautiful scenery if this episode was restored and released on DVD.",1210982400,,421,4.847222222222222
