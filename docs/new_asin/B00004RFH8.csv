1343164,4,B00004RFH8,"'Go for it!', I'd say if you are a major UFO fan.
I like the sequence and flow of the video footages as they are well arranged in accordance to their years and times of the incidents taken place. It's neat. On top of it, both of the narrators manage to remain open minded and do not act biased despite the fact that they are 'fanatic' UFO researchers and somewhat worshipers(due to their roles in the UFO studies).
For me, I'm no believer let alone a worshiper. I like this DVD set simply because I've had bad exerience in purchasing another more costly one entitled 'UFO and Paranormal Phenomena' which does not show any footages at all.
C'mon. Don't need to be too serious about it. If you like movies such as 'Independence Day', 'Close Encounter Of The 3rd Kind', 'The X-files' etc., just treat this as a spin-off of these movies and have fun watching it. Be it genuine or not, it's fun too even if you are bluffed by some footages sometimes.
But be warned! I would also like to advise you that almost 99% of the pictures of the footages compiled in this dvd set are blurry, unsteady(how come always only amateurs get to film most of the UFO footages, Huh???) and at times they are overly magnified. So you might have to undergo some head-spinning experience if watch for too long.",1054684800,9,1284,4.468085106382978
1343165,5,B00004RFH8,"This is a great series, if you are interested in UFO's then this set is for you.
I love it.",1050364800,,91,3.6
1343166,2,B00004RFH8,"I like the format of this DVD, they give you a location, date/time, and source of the video without narration.
Excellent format, but the overall content is poor.  Granted the material was not taken by Steven Spielberg, none-the-less the footage is mostly jerky (as in movement), blurred, over-saturated.  As far as the content of the DVD, alot of the images appeared to be down-to-earth in explanation.  Alot of the early videos, from the 40's through the 70's, were mysterious at the time as most people had no idea what an after-burner was.  And anyone who has ever filled a garbage bag with a lighter-than-air gas such as helium or methane, and let it float away would recognize a good portion of the videos in this collection.
The title, The Complete Evidence, may be misleading.  None of the material in this DVD is classified, so the word Complete is inappropriate here.  Perhaps the word Publically Available should have been substituted for the word Complete.  It is reasonable to assume that the really GOOD stuff is still classified and not available to the general public.
There were a couple of interesting videos that can raise an eyebrow, but all-in-all I feel this was a collection of films of military jets, experimental aircraft, balloons, bags, and a few obvious fakes.  I would not recommend this DVD as supporting evidence for the existance of UFO's, the countless eyewitness testimony on record is much more persuesive.  By the same token, this DVD does not provide any evidence for UFO skeptics to use either.  The hoaxes are obvious hoaxes.",1027900800,8,1563,4.908745247148289
1343167,2,B00004RFH8,"I have been involved with UFO study since 1979.  This DVD is a big disapointment.  The narration and editing are poor.  Save your money and buy some legit UFO material with it.  This can be considered a 2 disc ""flop-o-rama"".  Embarassing.",1025913600,7,238,4.7073170731707314
1343168,4,B00004RFH8,"I anxiously awaited the receipt of this DVD. Imagine my surprise (and irritation) at discovering this material was released on VHS as UFO-The Footage Archives (with an added CD-ROM contained the MJ-12 documents and other material).  I bought that set (3 volumes) less than a year ago, and gave it a good review (published by Amazon) then, so I am giving it a good review now.  In fact, it is recommended over the VHS version.  It has added material, can be slowed down for frame-by-frame viewing, and cost less than the tape set.  Still, it is irksome to find that the same material has been repackaged, renamed and resold.  Someone is making money off the UFO phenomenon.",976492800,11,672,4.7094017094017095
1343185,4,B00004RFH8,"Very comprehensive look at the span of history as it related to UFO's.  Informative and clearly researched very well, this film is geared toward the UFO fan but would be entertaining to even those with slight interest.  Very well recommended.",1236902400,4,242,5.025
1343186,3,B00004RFH8,"An interesting look at history, types, stereotypes and so forth with regard to UFOs and alien sightings and spacecraft. Nick Pope is basically a go-to guy in this field.",1233705600,,169,4.862068965517241
1343187,4,B00004RFH8,"Wow, what an eye opener. A modern day debunking of the UFOs and Aliens our culture and society has created.

1343188,1,B00004RFH8,Yet another video from UFO hangers-on who drain others of information they have spent years collecting and then present it as their own. Believers and UFO Buffs will find this boring and useless. Skeptics will not even waste their time trying to wade through this endless video nightmare.,1145404800,6,288,5.020833333333333
1343189,1,B00004RFH8,"The ridiculous construction of this DVD and its portrayal of objects it identifies as obvious man-made items or as natural constructs is a farce unworthy of being called a DVD if it were not for the fact that it is imprinted upon that medium.

Ultimate UFO: The Complete Evidence is the attempt on the part of denial science and/or our rotten ""keep everything possible secret"" Government to persuade citizens that UFOs are non-existent, and nothing more.  Despite a paranoid hue to my evaluation, we do know with all certainty that UFOs do exist and are not all mistaken sightings of ordinary objects, stars, or hoaxes.  Demonstrable has been the evidence that the lying Govt has attempted and succeeded in dissuading people from speaking the truth about their sightings. They have eliminated evidence and attempted to make people, who've disclosed accounts of their sightings, look as liars about their sightings.

On the UFO series on The History channel, it has been revealed that George Bush, Sr. who was head of the CIA during Jimmy Carter's admin, replied to President Carter's request for the truth about UFOs, ""We can't divulge UFO information just to satisfy your curiosity""!  If UFOs aren't real, and Blue Book was really discontinued then what is there to divulge?  This statement constitutes undeniable truth that the Govt DOES have data on UFOs and that it is aware that they ARE NOT erroneous sightings.  This constitutes solid confirmation of these 2 facts.

It has been said that the Govt denies UFOs because it would cause riotous panic -- give us a break! Perhaps in more simpler times, BUT NOT NOW.

Truth is, that UFOs and their 'occupants' are not technological devices from other planets but are far more part of something else -- Men in Black that ignore the laws of nature in their behaviors, strange monsters that terrorize certain locations, entities that appear to manifest via occult practices. In a location experiencing a UFO flap there is a simultaneous occurrence of UFOs, MIBs, monster sightings, a sudden and local increase of psi abilities, manifestatiions of demons and ghosts, etc. Moreover these sightings recur, from time to time, over decades in the same places.

There is a helluva lot more to the UFO question than most realize especially the scientific community. The Govt quakes in its boots over this, because it realizes that there is no way that they can be from other planets.  As such Govt has no explanation for what they are, because the scientific est uses tools and forms of measurements that fit physical reality quite well, but do not correlate to ultraphysical reality to any degree. Their tools and measurements are wrong, so they deny the validity of UFOs and its concordant entities.  Like denying that something is real because it is created in the metric system and all you have is the inch system.

For more about this, the true interpretation of UFOs read the books by John A. Keel, a former journalist, who did the leg-work research on this over a period of years.",1144972800,4,3028,4.902152641878669
1343190,1,B00004RFH8,"Continual disappointment, bar the handful that are not blurry pin points.

  The best footage of the (fake?) Mexico City huge flying saucer is so overexposed on this DVD you can not ever see it!

  The 2 narrators have no clue what they are seeing, and have done no research on what the clips are.

  I think they are UFo researchers.

  It's almost like any pair of people recorded in their lounge watching it for the first time, who have a bit of UFO knowledge. It gets annoying to hear every other clip - ""Yeh, I think it's another weather balloon.""

  I understand it's no one's fault -  but the aliens' - they are pricks. I just was expecting to finally see some I had not seen, preferably CLOSE UPS.

  There was one. The Edward Meier one out in nature, suspended motionless in air next to a coincidential tree and a must see as he zooms it into a full CLOSEUP.

  Scientifically objectively, 1 star is over-generous as that is 20 percent when it's more like 2 decent.

1343191,2,B00004RFH8,"This DVD was originally released on VHS under the title 'UFO: The Footage Archives'.  It has about five and a half hours worth of footage on two DVDs.

I got this from an amazon seller for just a few dollars.  Personally I don't think it's worth it even if you can get it cheap.  Alls this is a collection of mostly uninteresting video clips from about the 50's to almost present day, with objects that they claim are UFOs.  This doesn't really have any commentary, it just has text that shows up on the screen like a story right before the video clip is shown.  Watching this is like watching a project put togeather by high school students.  The title claims this is evidence but there is really little evidence.  Just a collection of questionable, boring, poor quality video clips.",1125187200,4,784,4.55
1343192,5,B00004RFH8,"Don't listen to the negative reviews - the material collected on these DVDs are sometimes multiple generation copies (would you part with original material if you had filmed it?)

 There are many clips taken from multiple cameras/sources and angles and impossible to fake. Keep an open mind - you may be witnessing the real deal. It's a shame that so many people are willing to deny the evidence in front of them.

 Also - to answer an earlier question from a reviewer: why are all the videos taken by amateurs and appear shaky? It's because without the aid of a stabilizing device such as a tripod it is impossible for any human being to hold a camera on full zoom perfectly straight (try it sometime if you don't believe me). The wobble is unavoidable.

 Any UFO buff will find this DVD compelling and worthwhile. Recommended.",1090800000,10,828,4.675862068965517

This film does nothing to prove or disprove UFOs, but it gives tons of very exciting revelations into different possibilities when it comes to the existence of UFOs. After watching, I am more inclined to believe that they do exist, but I loved learning about the mind & everything I learned is very applicable. None of this was time wasted.

Are these experiences ancient as well, and were they experienced as ""angels and devils"" in the past?  Or as other mystical experiences, depending on a person's particular beliefs?  An even more intriguing idea is that our unconscious produces these ideas of alien visitation out of a shared evolution.  In other words, are we ourselves visitors from another planet?  Did our ancestors populate Earth, and we're just recalling a common origin?  There is such a similarity between alien abduction reports, it's hard to discount the possibilities.
