5634905,5,B00BJB2GWY,"Great song by Frankie Laine. Great film directed by Delmer Daves. Solid performances from Glenn Ford, Van Heflin and the remainder of the actors who you will recognize and remember and you don't see much these days.

Superb supplements which include comments from Elmore Leonard (from 2013) and interesting comments from Ford's son & biographer Peter.

I highly recommend this film.",1369353600,,382,5.245901639344262
5634906,4,B00BJB2GWY,"I just saw the original version with Glenn Ford on Bluray for the first time and it looks great.
Good old-time Western with great Bluray quality.
I also own and really like the re-make with Russell Crowe.
Really, two different movies for two different times.
This original is only 90 minutes long and has very few extras, so way too expensive at almost $30.
Wait till it goes down in price and it will be a good one for your collection!",1369008000,,436,4.395061728395062
5634907,4,B00BJB2GWY,"First of all, the original ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a fantastic film, and even better than the 2007 remake with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.  Top notch performances, an interesting dynamic between the central characters and plenty of suspense with few distractions along the way.  It's a classic that's held up quite well over 50 years later.

As far as this Blu-ray goes, Criterion has done a respectable job here.  The wonderful 4K restoration was supervised by Sony's Grover Crisp last year to coincide with the film's entry into the National Film Registry.  Featuring superb detail that showcases the film's crisp cinematography, every visual aspect of ""3:10 to Yuma"" has been rendered flawlessly in 1080p.  A new 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is also included along with the original Mono mix, so purists and those looking for more surround activity will have their choice of presentations.

The only slightly disappointing aspect of this release is its lack of meaty extras, somewhat atypical for a Criterion release.  Only a pair of short (10-15 minute) interviews with author Elmore Leonard and Glenn Ford's son are included, but they're entertaining and informative.  So while this release is definitely overpriced a bit---even by Criterion's standards---fans of the film should really appreciate the work that went into it.",1368748800,9,1331,5.211267605633803
5634908,4,B00BJB2GWY,"I bought the original version of 3:10 to Yuma because I wanted to compare it with the Russell Crowe remake. I liked both. Crowe played a great bad guy, but Glenn Ford, normally cast as a good guy, appeared to enjoy playing a rogue. (3:10 to Yuma is now my favorite Glenn Ford movie.)

I won't discuss specifics, but there were several plot or character improvements in the new version, however, I preferred the ending in the 1957 film. In fact, the contrast in endings tells a lot about Hollywood's reluctance to embrace traditional heroes. (Elmore Leonard's short story has yet another ending.)

Production values were certainly better in the later version. It's also fun to watch the two trailers back-to-back to see how selling movies has advanced in the last fifty years.

If you're a film student, movie enthusiast, or just like Westerns, both versions are great additions to a private library.",1234569600,2,899,4.862745098039215

5634912,5,B00BJB2GWY,"I was 13 when this movie came out.  I saw ""Shane,"" ""High Noon,"" and ""The Man from Laramie"" (and a bunch of less-distinguished but enjoyable Westerns), but I missed this one, and I'm glad to have seen it now, in the excellent print by Criterion, with interesting ""special feature"" interviews with Elmore Leonard (on whose early story the movie is based) and Glenn Ford's son, who was about 12 when Glenn was working on the film.  Leonard, interviewed in 2013, not long before he died, looks frail but is full of pep and information.  It's a charming and useful addition.  Ford's son is more gossipy, but there's an enjoyment of his dad in his remarks that doesn't preclude his seeing Ford's weaknesses as a husband and father very clearly.  The essay included in the booklet, by Kent Jones, maybe states the case for Delmer Daves's immortality a bit too much . . . but it also has good, contextualizing information.

The movie, beautifully shot (by Charles Lawton, Jr) and very effectively paced by Delmer Daves, is now considered a ""classic"" of the genre, and I'm going to say nothing of the plot, just in case there are a few younger fans of the genre who might not have seen it yet.  It has a more psychological focus than Zinnemann's ""High Noon"" (where the focus is ethical), and it also is less claustrophobically zeroed in on place than Zinnemann's movie (and that isn't a criticism of Zinnemann).  Rather, it connects the psychological pressure on Dan Evans (Van Heflin) to the economics of his situation as a small rancher in drought-stricken Arizona and to his pained consciousness of perhaps failing as a husband and a father in part because of the economic pressures on him.  Heflin, who was wonderful in ""Shane,"" where his masculinity was also in question, is superb here with a character more richly connected to his inner life.  If the pressures on Dan are quite transparent -- and they are transparent too to Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), the outlaw whom Dan has undertaken (for $200.00) to get safely on to the 3:10 train to Yuma and to prison -- Wade himself is less transparent.  He seems a mysterious mixture of impulses, and Glenn Ford gives a winning performance of this complicated man.  Apparently, Ford was initially offered the Evans character but turned it down, seeing something in Wade that he wanted to have a go at -- a good choice on his part!  Felicia Farr, Henry Jones , and Robert Emhardt are very good in supporting roles, while the members of Wade's gang are less sharply individualized -- which makes Wade's charisma all the more compelling.  The movie runs at 90 minutes, with plenty of time given to crisply written scenes in a variety of locations (the range, the hotel in town, Evans's farm, the train station), and the combination of adequately dramatized lead-up and the growing suspense of the two hours before 3:10 are really very efficiently and concisely handled.  It's a must-see.",1440028800,3,2920,4.754455445544554

5634920,5,B00BJB2GWY,"3:10 To Yuma showcases the acting talents of its leads, especially Glenn Ford, as an outlaw negotiating his way out of a trip to the federal prison. It features some really stunning black and white cinematography, as well as beautiful outdoor settings, to achieve its cinematic effect. It's one of the Best Westerns I have seen in a very long time, and if you love Westerns, you will not be disappointed by this one.

The story follows a gang that robs a stagecoach for its gold, and the leader of the gang ends up killing the stagecoach driver. The outlaw, played by Glenn Ford, is captured by the authorities and held up in a hotel where he must wait his dreaded train, the 3:10 to Yuma, which will take him to federal prison. Van Heflin portrays the struggling rancher who volunteers to escort the outlaw to the train. What ensues is a suspenseful cat and mouse game between the two men, which ends in a thrilling climax as the train pulls into the station.

5634923,5,B00BJB2GWY,"I loved every second of this Criterion blu-ray. There is new video commentary by the author... which is outstanding. The new commentary by Glenn Ford's son Peter is worthy on its own of causing purchase of the disk. Seldom do we get so much insight offered with good-hearted wisdom. My every-second appreciation applies to all components of the disk. How extra wonderful to have Frankie Laine singing the theme. I found myself repeating the playback of the song. A 5.1 DTS sound track is available... which I thought was great. The outstanding American character Henry Jones has a very good part. Robert Emhardt, one of the ...best sweating actors in the movies, plays Mr. Butterfield. Every actor is excellent. The sets are fantastic. The black & white image is unbelievable. It makes me want to get out my Leica and some b&W film.

The movie is full of worthy morality. This movie goes to my stack for the grandchildren. I would like to see it used in high schools.",1374451200,13,967,4.72189349112426
5634924,5,B00BJB2GWY,"A psychological drama that is much more about the battle of souls and the slippery nature of good and evil than
about gunplay and chase scenes.

Led by a great performance by Glenn Ford, going way against type as a low key, but highly charismatic, sexy bad guy,
who its hard to hate. And he's almost matched by a jittery Van Heflin as a down-on-his-luck rancher who agrees to bring
the very dangerous Ford to the titular train to be taken to prison. Heflin doesn't take the job out of any great moral belief,
but just because he desperately needs the $200 to have some shot of keeping his cattle alive and his family fed.

Beautifully shot, keeping the open feel of the south-west for the first act, the real climax of the film is a 30 minute set
piece in a hotel room that still manages to feel cinematic as Ford tries to gently, almost comically, bribe and woo Heflin
into letting him go, promising far more money than the $200 Heflin is being paid. And we see just how tempting that
offer is to Heflin, and how confusing doing the ""right"" thing can be.

A truly tense film. Its flaws or dated touches fade beneath its great images, sly dialogue, forceful direction, complex
characters, and 1st rate acting.",1374451200,7,1209,4.486363636363636

5634927,4,B00BJB2GWY,Gripping stuff with good performances by Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. The suspense is maintained right until the end. The Criterion Blu-ray transfer is crisp and a pleasure to watch. The disc was thin on Special Features but the movie more than makes up for it. Definitely a classic.,1370131200,,281,4.755102040816326
5634928,5,B00BJB2GWY,"One of Delmar Daves' and Glenn Ford's best westerns, ""3:10 to Yuma"" began life as an Elmore Leonard short story (in fact it was the first one published). Criterion's Blu-ray gives us a beautiful looking transfer of the film--grain is a bit more heavy and prominent during the opening titles (not a surprise given that it would be several generations removed from the original negative and that it had to go through an optical printer to be rephotographed)but, once the film begins, film grain is consistent and not quite as bulky with a pleasing appearance that beautifully renders the black and white photography of the film.

""3:10 to Yuma"" was made when Glenn Ford was at his peak as a box office draw and actor. Ford plays Ben Wade a charming but ruthless outlaw captured after he lingers in town a bit too long. Separated from his gang, he's arrested and, reluctantly, rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin in a perfect, performance that nicely captures his conflicted feelings)agrees to guard and escort Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma because he needs the money; his cattle are dying and his farm is failing because of a drought. Wade and Evans do form a bond with Wade trying to bribe Evans while he's guarding him and even assisting him as he develops a begruding respect for the rancher.

What gets overlooked is Ford's brilliant, subtle performance (one of his best)--he makes Wade a complex character at a time when most westerns were more likely to simplify characters and their motives. In fact ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""High Noon"" are the two films that pushed Howard Hawks to make ""Rio Bravo"" because he wanted to return to a time of psychologically less complex characters (ignoring the complexity Hawks own ""Red River""). ""3:10 to Yuma"" holds up remarkably well and Ford is matched by the tortured performance by Van Heflin.

As much as I enjoyed the remake with terrific performances from Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster, the original film is every bit its equal in my humble opinion--Daves develops a strong, psychological thriller that holds up surprisingly well. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is, at its heart, really about the time it was made in which critic and film historian Kent Jones does a nice job of summarizing in the booklet included with the Blu-ray.

Aside from a terrific 4K restoration of the film, the mono soundtrack has been redone for a 5.1 surround mix. It's not something that will knock your socks off but the effort is appreciated as it opens up the sound a bit.

One area this blu-ray does fall down is in the special features. Criterion normally has quite a bit of extras included with their releases (hence the steep price tag)unfortunately, that's not the case here.

We do get two extensive interviews though which are exceptionally good; Glenn Ford's son and biographer Peter gives us a great interview where he discusses his dad's preference for western (because they had less dialog--as Peter paraphrases his dad, Glenn would say that he had two speeds as an actor--slow and slower--and how he would go through removing dialog from the script), as well as, Daves.

Elmore Leonard discusses the genesis of the story, his opinions on both films made from it (the ending of the remake didn't make much sense to him for example)and gives a brief overview of his early Hollywood career related to ""Yuma"".

The previously mentioned booklet is excellent. I do wish that we had a commentary track but, on the whole, I can recommend this based on the exceptional transfer and the meager but good extras that we do get.",1369526400,5,3545,4.781045751633987
