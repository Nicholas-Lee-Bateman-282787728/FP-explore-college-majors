 You would love it.....",1154563200,3,87,4.733333333333333
2474095,4,B000CSUNTI,"The thesis of this documentary is that the extraordinary

sexual freedom and license in the 1920-1930's in three cities

(Berlin, Paris, & Shanghai) became a draw to the great artists

and literary figures of Europe. It is without doubt that Paris and Berlin did generate a renaissance of artistic creation during these decades but there were other factors such as

the flood of Russians from the excesses of communism, the

liberal attitudes of the Weimar republic, and the end of World War I so that artists did have an oppostunity to create without being engulfed in violent conflict.  Nevertheless, the two DVD

set is thought provoking.  For example, I learned that Berlin

waas the birthplace of the first film that dealt with the topic of homosexuals' struggling for acceptance in a hostile world. I also learned that Shanghai was totally ruled by gangsters so that even the police were hired from the ganster world.  Overall,

a worthwhile documentary of a unique time in world history.",1152057600,18,994,4.963636363636364
2474096,5,B000CSUNTI,"VEry well done documentaries. If you are interested in History, psychology or just interested in how People function, get this disk set. Packed with lots of interesting information that can help you form a more definitive view of human nature.",1149120000,6,243,5.1
8102174,4,B000CSUNTI,"Three great documentaries.  If you're expecting covert porn a la ""National Geographic titty stories"" you'll be disappointed.  Bought a couple of books on Weimar Berlin based on the Berlin documentary.  There are a few striking characters here.",1399334400,,243,5.513513513513513
8102175,4,B000CSUNTI,"I enjoyed very much the collection of three documentaries about Berlin, Paris and Shanghai, but I found them of uneven quality. The one on Berlin had too much focus on sexual perversions, and very little sociological analysis of the times. The one on Paris was interested but too antisceptic, focusing more on the intellectual class and too little on the average citizen's mores. The one on Shanghai was the most interesting, with aspects little known to many Westerners, and therefore it was didactic to show the influence of the European colonialism in the nascent and affluent merchant town.",1395273600,,594,5.071428571428571
8102176,5,B000CSUNTI,"I thought I knew quite a bit about the 1920s and 1930s, but Legendary Sin Cities contained a wealth of information about the period that has been systematically excluded from American history books.  Through this documentary, I discovered that the 1920s and 1930s were not only about Prohibition, American gangsters, the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the rise to power of Hitler, but also a much more vital, modern, and vibrant moment of human history.  The moral revisionists of the 1950s and 1960s did all they could to blot the memory of the daring bon-vivant culture from the history books and this documentary restore a sizable portion of it.  I would give it 10 stars for no better reason than I now understand who my grandparents were and what they did in Paris between the wars.",1381363200,2,793,4.773722627737226
8102177,5,B000CSUNTI,This film provides excellent research and primary source information into topics that are otherwise hard to research.  The pace and topic is exciting.,1363046400,,150,5.521739130434782
8102178,5,B000CSUNTI,This is a GREAT documentary!!! It's too bad that this version is a widescreen picture in a 4 X 3 aspect ratio. Please put this documentary on the Blu-ray format with the proper anamorphic widescreen presentation it deserves!,1360454400,,224,4.921052631578948
8102179,5,B000CSUNTI,"I simply love ""Legendary Sin Cities.  Overviews of Paris, Berlin & Shanghai particularily in the 20s and early 30's (except for Shanghai which goes into the late 30's).  Commentators are experts in some aspect of each city of the era.  Most of the commentators have authored a book or two on their respective city/subjects.  I recommend buying the books for additional more in depth material.  I found reading about Shanghai particularily interesting and now have @ least read 5 books about Shanghai in the 20's & 30's which has added to my Chinese studies (classic literature and non-fiction histories, etc.). I only wishes there were a Part 2 to this CD which could surely be expanded as there is no end to the additional interesting material in each culture/city.
Obviously these sin cities (open cities) only existed due to influx of money, which oddly really didn't filter down to the poor and desperate.  So these cities, while drawing outsiders, abounded in criminality @ every level and ignored for the most part the poor and desperate.  Have things changed that much?
I highly recommend this video.",1260748800,8,1107,4.951351351351351
8102180,4,B000CSUNTI,"The creators of this documentary about Shanghai, Berlin and Paris in the 1920s did an excellent job, using period footage (and some 1930s footage as well, if you know what you're looking for) to portray the decadence and depravity which took hold there. While only lightly touching on the human cost of prostitution, alcoholism and drug use (and even then primarily in the Shanghai episode) it emphasized the ""creativity"" known to be generated there... as if no great art was done outside these three cities or in the decades following. Also, outside ""costs"" were not addressed. The program discusses how the Nazis (they practically used the word ""hicks"") swept away the liberal life of Berlin, when I would make the argument that it was the very existence of Berlin's decadence which caused a backlash, one the fascists were able to ride into power. In Paris the decadence led to a lack of moral fiber when invaded by Germany. Overall, a good (and graphic) depiction of decadence but take the PC excuses with a grain of salt.",1236902400,7,1026,4.8352272727272725
8102181,4,B000CSUNTI,"Great DVD if you want to understand life in Paris and Berlin with the sexual mores between the world wars. Just returned from France, they have a three story sex museum that also covers this subject. The one DVD on Shanghai is a bit week, however I was amazed at what was happening in Paris and Berlin during the 1920's.",1216252800,4,320,4.35
8102182,4,B000CSUNTI,"This is an interesting documentary about three cities, Berlin, Paris, and Shanghai in the 1920's and early 1930's.  The film shows and tells the viewer of the glamour and deprivation that was rampant during this period.",1189728000,,219,5.083333333333333
8102183,4,B000CSUNTI,"A two-DVD set for those interested in at least one form of entertainment flourishing in Berlin, Paris and Shanghai between the two world wars.  Apparently sin and debauchery really knew few borders during that time.  Much of the contents is illustrated commentary and I, for one, would have wished for more illustration and less commentary, e.g., more of entertainers like Josephine Baker in the Paris portion and of Claire Waldoff and Marlene Dietrich in the Berlin portion.  Just about totally absent were routines by the Berlin cabaret comedians but perhaps they weren't considered sufficiently sinful and maybe there isn't much film footage about them.",1188777600,13,656,5.288461538461538
