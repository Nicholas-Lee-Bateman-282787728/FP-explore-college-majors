8077212,4,6305298432,It was a gift for my husband which he liked since he always used to watch the fights with Ali and others.,1390694400,,105,3.8181818181818183
8077213,3,6305298432,"This is a VERY short (38minutes) Collection of Ali interviews surrounding his fights...and often in very grainy black and white condition that seems almost bootleg in its lack  of sharpness.  This is the connective tissue they present between the bouts on bigger programs and run together make for a pretty dry viewing experience that somehow seems  LONGER Than its mere 38 minutes. I love Ali,  am glad to have it but would NOT recommend it to  anybody but an Ali collector who has Ringside and the Complete and heck almost all  the other DVDs available which are better.",1246320000,4,572,4.785714285714286
8077214,2,6305298432,This tape does not include Ali's best material - his repartee with Howard Cosell.  I was disappointed that the interview footage shown here does not give a glimpse of Ali's fierce intelligence and sense of humor.  The tape  provides a rather dull 40 minutes showing career highlights and  badly-synched interview segments.,952128000,12,322,5.254901960784314
