8358060,2,B0029PSEMU,The narrative I thought was lacking any great detail of driving the circuit with explanations of how and why you should take each corner . I thought it was going to really teach you step by step as to how to get around Lime Rock Quickly. Not just an overview of the track. Lacked a lot of drive insight I was looking for.,1410480000,,321,4.111111111111111
8358061,5,B0029PSEMU,"Drive: Lime Rock instantly transports you into the driver's seat of a racecar on one of America's most prestigious tracks.  Nick Longhi provides amazing insight and skill into negotiating every turn, straight away and hill at Lime Rock Park.  His easy mannered and expert level narration combined with the unique video style by James Levine is a must for driving enthusiasts and pros alike.
Buckle up!",1243382400,2,401,5.0606060606060606
8358062,5,B0029PSEMU,"This DVD is amazing!!!  It is so much better than the video that came out a few years ago for Watkins Glen.  Unlike that video, this one is driven and instructed by one of the top race drivers of our time.
The multi-camera split screen is a great teaching tool because I could see the driver's hands and face at the same time I was watching what he was seeing.  I highly recommend this video.",1242777600,,392,4.2
8358063,5,B0029PSEMU,"The combination of the multiple camera angles and instructions from driver Nick Longhi allows every turn at the famous Lime Rock race track to be covered in
detail. Nick's analysis is concise and in depth. Although I've been on this track many times, I've come away with a fresh look and refined technique that can be applied to improve my skills and lap times. The camerawork is spot-on.  I hope this company will expand the series at other race tracks in the future.",1242172800,3,468,4.63855421686747
8358064,5,B0029PSEMU,I've been attending High-performance driving school track days for the last three years at Lime Rock with the BMW club.  I thought I knew how to drive this track really well; until I saw the video.  I can't wait to get back out to the track with the new techniques I've just learned.  Nick Longhi is a wonderful teacher.  This video is the closest thing to having Nick in the car next to me.  It's amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to drive with more control; on the track and off.,1242172800,4,518,4.298969072164948
