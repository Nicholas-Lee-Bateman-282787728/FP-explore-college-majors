8466352,5,B005D7E7ZO,"Blu-ray looked good.  The story, in three, 2 hour (roughly) episodes, with subtitles, was engrossing.  A great example of a failure in trying to legislate morality.  I liked the way it started, long before the amendment was passed.  If you love US history you will love this. Saloons, pubs, and bars (does"" Cheers"" count?) will never seem the same.  Great pictures, music and movie clips.  Also liked the extras, extended scenes and all.  At $12 bucks, plus S&H, currently a good value I think.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I am mostly a ""teetotaler"", as evidently were many of the ""bootleggers"", too (how they got that nickname is also explained).",1408060800,,654,4.828828828828829
