8274803,1,B0019N6TSE,60 Dollars ?!?!?! You can get these on DVD for like 10 bucks or less each,1218758400,,73,3.625
8274804,5,B0019N6TSE,I have grew up watching MRS. DOUBTFIRE so of course i think that this is a comedy that is a must get on BLU-RAY . Ive seen JUNO and think it is also a must get on BLU-RAY. The only one i am not sure about is THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. I think i might have saw it in the movie theater but i cant remember. So does anyone know if it is a good movie??,1215820800,,344,3.539473684210526
8274805,5,B0019N6TSE,"I agree with the above person. These aren't DVDs so if you're expecting to pay DVD prices you're being unreasonable. If you can't afford the new technology then that's fine and understandable (god knows I won't spend $400 bucks on a phone), but don't be a baby about it. Just wait for the prices to go down and in the meantime watch your dvds.",1212105600,2,343,4.375
8274806,5,B0019N6TSE,"Some people don't realize that new technology is more expensive than old technology. This is to be expected.

If you're prepared to accept that a new technology is going to cost more than you'll probably realize this is actually a good deal for three very good movies, in HI-DEF!",1212105600,2,279,4.6938775510204085
8274807,1,B0019N6TSE,I agree with the last person.  I got  an email about this bundle and it said 45% off.  what?!!! and they're still $20 each? CRAZY.  COMPLETELY NUTS!,1212105600,4,148,4.37037037037037
8274808,2,B0019N6TSE,"I'm sure I'll take some flak for writing this in a ""product review"" forum. I'm not reviewing this product. I'm simply noting, for the benefit of anyone producing Blu-ray players or discs, that I will not be taking the Hi-Def plunge until prices come down significantly. I mean, who are we kidding? Even in the bundle, these discs are still $20.00 a piece. Come on!

And don't even get me started about $300 players.",1212019200,2,415,4.608108108108108
