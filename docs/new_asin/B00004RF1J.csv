like watching Orr playing.

It has a detailed story of Wayne, and Messier (both ironically don't really occur in overtime but are in the playoffs) and then there is a montage of historical playoff overtime goals.  I was expecting a little bit more focus on specific players and events with a less in depth detail.  Almost a third of the video is about Montral's cup run of 1993.  Great info, but could have and should have been cut way down; the same thing about a devil team making a run at the playoffs.  Both were near the end and while I appreciate the historical aspect of the clips, they were just way too long only an hour video.  I was expecting shorter pieces including bigger names.  Overall ok, but there are definitely better ones out there.  C+  You are not going to ""wow"" anyone into becoming a hockey fan with this video.",1156032000,10,919,4.321637426900585
