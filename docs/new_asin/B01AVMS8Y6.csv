As someone providing workshops and programs on second half of life issues and resources, I greatly appreciate substantive films portraying intergenerational relationships and issues, especially at a time when grandparents and grandchildren are often separated by large distances. It's been posited that it was the innovation of three-generational families that enabled homo sapiens to emerge from among the various homonid groups in Africa, and I think the disconnection of the three generations is one of the most serious problems confronting us today--a problem this film portrays both critically and compassionately in a cinematographically beautiful way.",1500854400,,715,5.691588785046729

8748610,5,B01AVMS8Y6,"In a culture where movies continually evolve to further extremes of violence and lust idolizing the dregs of society, this is a treasure of contrast. Rather than stoking emotional reaction thru displays of greed, anger, envy, or other fallacies of our human condition, we are immersed into a world of simple relationships - between spouses, family generations, even complete strangers. The contrasting settings of urban and rural China flow smoothly into each other without judgement, tho scenes of country villages and wild spaces invoke (for me) the feeling of childhood wonder at the perfect beauty of a time and place. Having experienced relatives and myself being ripped off by Chinese in business, this movie was healing, observing cooperation, kindness, charity, and forgiveness. Perhaps a movie without a voice raised in anger may bore some, but personally this was one of the best movies I've ever seen.",1482192000,,912,5.2534246575342465
