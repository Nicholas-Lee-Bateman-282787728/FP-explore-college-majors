8178068,5,B000NIVJHC,"This is great. It is a much welcome break from blatently obvious set em up knock em down comedy stylings. It is a feel good comedy and I reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the Montey python group or the Broken Lizard group. If you like this movie also watch ""The Rage in Placid Lake"" and ""He Died With A fellaffel In His Hand.""",1325116800,,331,3.955223880597015
8178069,2,B000NIVJHC,"This is quite possibly the hardest comedy I have ever had to sit through. The story is very hard to follow (if you can follow it at all), and the humor is hard to grasp (I don't know if you have to be Australian to get the jokes or what). If your in the mood for an hour and a half of idiot paradise, this is for you, if not rent or buy something else.",1187136000,,352,3.7066666666666666
