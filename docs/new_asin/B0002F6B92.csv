2094510,3,B0002F6B92,"We love the visual presentation of fractions and decimals and the fact that so many variations are presented. The concepts are presented well so that ""equivalent fractions"" and concepts such as ""numerator"" and ""denominator"" need no further explanation. I still feel Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking in their 'engagement factor' with children. Leap Frog has a much more engaging way of teaching the concepts they cover. The Science Videos by Rock 'n Learn are moving towards that Leap Frog, story-telling, character based video learning style, however, the Math Rock 'n Learn videos are lacking that. Rock 'n Learn videos do have strengths in visual presentation of math concepts and in repetition of presentation, both of which are important.",1239494400,5,742,5.243697478991597
2094511,4,B0002F6B92,"Having practiced multiplication tables with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock/dp/B00023BLG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rap/dp/B00023BLFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rap</a>&nbsp;DVDs in this series, next in line was fractions, and this DVD explains the basics in an easy to understand format using cartoons, visual aids and music.

The three cartoon characters explain the concepts of numerators and denominators using candy bars, pizza and gummy bears, and sing a song about congruent parts, which I learned are parts of the whole that are the same shape and size.

The DVD also covers equivalent fractions, proper and improper fractions and mixed numerals before shifting over to decimals.  In the decimal section, it covers tenths, hundredths and thousandths, converting fractions to decimals, and adding and subtracting with common denominators. It also touches on handling really long conversions like 1/3.

This one is more informative than the multiplication DVDs, and rather than just recitation, there are things to be learned here.  The key points are repeated and reinforced, and there is also a section where students can give the answer before the DVD does.

Again, this DVD works best as a back-up learning tool to supplement what the child is doing in school, and the only thing that could be improved is the animation.  Rated: 4.5 stars

2094512,5,B0002F6B92,"This is great as an introduction to learning and understanding fractions.  It uses items that children can relate to (pizza, candy, etc.)and that they would use in every day life so that they can see the relevance of fractions  The music is upbeat and the graphics are excellent.  It gives explanations, examples, and graphics for every concept about fractions.  It also has questions after each concept to test their understanding of what has been shown. This is also good for a general review of fractions. Every math teacher should have this DVD in their colection.",1203724800,12,568,4.947368421052632

2094550,5,B0002F6B92,"We have been using the newer animated Rock and Learn series DVDs for about 1 year now.  This newer series of their products use animated characters versus the older series of Rock and Learn products that use people playing guitars and cheesy powerpoints flashing around them.  The newer animated series probably have less Rock music in them versus the older ones, but the format for learning I think has greatly improved with the newer series, and the creativity is much higher than before.  While these DVDs are a bit corney for the age that they are targeting on the label, they will learn from them.  For slightly younger children (grade K-2nd), the comedy and puns in these videos make them laugh.  Where these DVDs I believe are awesome is for the younger, quick learners that have not reached 3rd grade; they will probably find the animation more on par with their maturity level.  For grade level kids, these are still probably the best videos on the market for the various subject matters.

The visual examples that they use along with the animated characters and their interaction with other animated characters to understand concepts being presented is excellent, creative and keeps younger children's interest.  Our boys are very advanced for their age (4.5 and Kindergarten), and these have been helpful tools for them to learn concepts at a very young age.

Example, our Kindergartner fully understand the fractions and decimals DVD; he is working at 4-5th grade level math. For most children this age including our younger 4.5 year old, I know that this DVD might be too soon to introduce.  What is great to know is that when he is ready, this video will be very useful for him to learn at whatever age that happens to be.  If you have young, quick learners, I might make sure they have mastered Rock 'n Learn's Time, and Money DVDs before attempting to introduce the Fraction DVD.  If your child fully understand adding, and subtraction of whole number including money ($ and cents), then this DVD helps take them to the next level with decimals and fractions.  We found that understanding money is a very useful tool for helping kids understand these higher level math concepts (fractions and decimals); our everyday coins which they should be familar with are simply fractional representations of a dollar.

Overall, this fraction DVD should be a very helpful tool to supplement education of this topic for young and older children. You may want other tools to help reinforce and master the math concepts explained in these videos such as practice worksheets like Kumon Fractions and Decimals (Grade, 4, 5) or Kumon Fractions (Grade 6).  However, many of their DVDs have a practice test that reviews subject material, and show kids how to carefully take a multiple question test.  I believe that thier DVDs are a must have for the home-schooling parents.  As an adult, I have learned some things from their Science series for 4th and 5th grade as well.  Thanks to Rock and Learn I may now be smarter than a 5th grader - at least in science, and math :)

Our favorites Rock and Learn DVDs with animation are listed:

Telling Time (age level is 6 and up)
Money and Making change (age level is 6 and up)
Fractions & Decimals (age level is 8 and up)

Science series DVDs:
Human Body (Grade 4 and up)
Three other DVDs - Life Science, Earth Science, and Physcial Science (Grade 5 and up)

Older style series:
Spanish Rock 'n Learn

Our 4.5 year old really likes the Human Body DVD for 4th graders.  Our just-turned 6 year old really likes all the science DVDs with Earth Science as his favorite.  Really, it is amazing to observe how much they can learn at such a young age, if they enjoy the material.  When asked to write about something small in class, our 6 year old chose to use an ""atom"" as his example.  Now how many 6 year olds know about atoms?  The ones that find these DVDs entertaining.

While I've provided the stated age levels from each Rock and Learn DVD, our young and quick learners seem to like them all. Every child is unique, and have their own time for interest and readiness.  Nobody probably knows the child better than the CEO of their young life - the parent.  If you buy it, and your child doesn't have an interest, simply try again in 1/2 year to a year later.  At some point they will probably find it helpful to their understanding.

If your not sure about a purchase, try checking your local library.  Here in Phoenix, we found that many of these DVDs are at the local libraries.  Yet, for the price on Amazon, we prefer to purchase and keep them at home so when the kids want to watch, they can.  Repetition helps them remember and keep these facts.

Lastly, you can visit Rock 'n Learn's website for free study materials on there DVD topics at www MarkoThePencil.com  There are practice tests and study materials that your child can use to be sure they know the material.

I am so grateful these videos exist.  I just wish they had a Chinese version of the language DVD, as well as Geometry and Chemistry.",1326672000,12,5049,4.6355455568054
2094551,3,B0002F6B92,"My children, ages 6 and 8 1/2 enjoy watching this and the other 2 Rock N'Learn videos we got (Writing Strategies and Math Word Problems), but the videos are all too rudimentary for my 3rd grader, for whom they were purchased.  My kindergartner likes them, and maybe what she's learned from them will give her a leg up when she has to learn these things.  The strangest thing to me is that there is NO ROCK in these videos - not much music at all, really.  What a strange thing to name your series!",1304812800,,497,4.26595744680851

I think its approach is a bit below their level (My kids are 6 and 8 years old).",1252886400,4,261,4.4375

8027779,5,B0002F6B92,"I teach Special Ed. and love Rock 'N Learn products. I showed this to my elementary students who love it. Teaching middle schoolers, some of them are bratty and complain a lot (about EVERYthing), but that's the life. The ones who complain also sing (and dance) along with the rest of us -especially if certain rewards are offered. I stop the video and have the kids write notes in their journals as, I type them onto the smart board in different colors to help them track visually and have them practice with the fractions and decimals. They use dry erase boards, markers, and erasers to answer questions about terminology, fractions, and decimals. I added percents to extend their lesson and wish that was on the video too.

We sing, chant, and dance: ""Same size. Same shape. Congruent."" ""When you want to know what you've got, count the number of places to the right of the little dot (decimal) One, tenths, ....""

This also helped me identify how one of student's brain and eyes aren't communicating well add and how to provide extra math support. (I've discovered he can't see lines well, so I have him come up and point to each section aloud. Several do it, but I require him to and now he gets correct answers if I cue him just a little.)
For elementary, you will love this! If you have middle (and maybe high school), suffer through the whining. In fact, torture them by playing the songs as a repetitive review until they stop whining (muhahahahaaaa)!",1520380800,,1459,4.629343629343629
