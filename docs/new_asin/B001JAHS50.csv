3654188,2,B001JAHS50,"The first season of The Big Valley had it all: great stories, great visual reproduction, clear audio, and even subtitles.  Unfortunately, quality would not be a consideration in the seasons that followed.  Seasons Two and Three are pale in comparison - literally.  The print is faded and washed out, even grainy.  The rich colors and clear visuals are gone.  So too is the audio.  The audio is not as crisp and clear, and for those who need subtitles, these are gone too.  These things combine to make watching these seasons of The Big Valley much less enjoyable.  There are no extras either - just the episodes.

Unfortunately, the studio that put this season together (Timeless Media) did it on the cheap. They did not get a quality print to make their reproduction.  It's sub-par.  It's like watching an old rerun on an old TV set.  In this age of HD visuals and audio, this season falls far short of expectations.  I will not purchase season 4, based in the poor quality of season 3.

I  am GREATLY disappointed!

3654437,1,B001JAHS50,"Big Valley is my ""all-time"" favorite TV western, so I was ""extremely upset"" when I discovered they only have select episodes from each season and not the complete season. The original series went as follows: Season 1 & 2, 30 episodes each season; Season 3 & 4, 26 episodes each season. Now HERE is what the DVD collections offer: Season 1 - 18 episodes; Season 2 - 15 episodes; Season 3 - 30 episodes; & Season 4 - 30 episodes. I was like a little kid at Christmas when I saw seasons 3 & 4 being released; when I checked the episodes I discovered some of the 30 in Season 3 are actually from Season 2, and some AREN'T THERE AT ALL!! What a complete mess!! I was looking all over for one of my favorite episodes, ""Court Martial"", only to discover it's not in ANY of the 4 Season collections. Did I return this : NO!! I love the show, and better to have 2/3rd's of the season in HD then none; but DO NOT BE FOOLED!!! NONE OF THESE ARE THE ""COMPLETE"" SEASONS!!!

3654654,4,B001JAHS50,"This show was consistently good for a series that seemed ""made to order"" for its star Barbara Stanwyck.  The premise is very similar to Bonanza except the Barkleys are guided by a widow instead of a widower and she has a daughter along with her sons.  The Barkleys run a ranch and are well-to-do and respected in their community (much like Bonanza).  But the show is not a cheap imitation, it has its own identity and stands on its own quite well thanks to good writing and quality production.  Ms. Stanwyck is excellent (of course) and the other regulars are very good (especially Peter Breck as Nick Barkley). The show also introduced Linda Evans and Lee Majors who went on to further success in later years.",1406592000,3,710,4.611111111111111
3654655,4,B001JAHS50,"The Barkleys aren't your typical family drama, they go through a number of harrowing experiences this season. On more than one occasion, Victoria gets punched in the face and knocked off her feet by men who aren't particularly enamored by her charms, gets dragged along the ground by a wagon chained by her wrists, Jarrod gets blinded by a dynamite blast and then has to prosecute the man responsible in court while tripping over objects during the trial, Audra gets drugged, kidnapped and locked in a cellar in an incredible town scheme involvement, later she gets stalked by a psycho physicist who wants to kill her, Heath gets captured, enslaved and whipped by a Mormon clan and Nick almost gets hammered on the head by a hillbilly family after his money. Fortunately they all survive for season 4, scheduled to appear sometime in October.

In any case, season 3 is finally here after many years of waiting, there is just one complaint that I have that prevents me from assigning 5 stars. TMG, like in many other releases, has failed to provide an episode guide. Big Valley has many big name guest stars appearing throughout their seasons, so I would have liked to have known who appears where.

What is also quite disappointing is that there are very few appearances of Linda Evans this year, she's only in the first half of this season, and even then only has bit parts in all but 2 or 3 episodes, apparently Audra is off travelling in Rome occasionly sending back greetings, now what was that all about ? The Big Valley without Linda Evans just isn't as interesting, like Gunsmoke without Dennis Weaver or Bonanza without Pernell Roberts.

So we all know that The Big Valley is one of the top westerns ever produced, picture quality is improved over season 2 since there are only 4 or 5 episodes per disk, and we all enjoy the stars and guest appearances, such as James Gregory, L.Q. Jones, Milton Berle, Robert Fuller, Lloyd Bochner, James Whitmore, Susan Strasberg, Royal Dano, Lew Ayres, Richard Anderson, Bradford Dillman, Judy Carne, Fritz Weaver, Bruce Dern, Peter Whitney, Dennis Hopper, Quentin Dean, Albert Salmi, Yaphet Kotto, Russell Johnson, Charles Grodin, Barbara Luna, Julie Adams. Leslie Parrish, Anne Helm, Ray Danton, Van Williams, Robert Middleton,  Michael Burns and Regis Philbin, however it would have been very helpful to have had an episode guide, 1 star taken off for this oversight.",1406505600,5,2414,4.866180048661801

3654769,5,B001JAHS50,"Many people are fans of this series for various reasons from the actos/actresses to the well written characters to the nostalgia of TV noire.  Whatever the reason many of us agree that The Big Valley is just good family entertainment.  The fans have waited for an extremely long time for this series to be made available.  Fox, listen up!  Many of us would rather be honest and pay for the series produced by the copyright owner.  By not making this series available for fans to purchase, many might be forced to buy bootleg copies thereby causing Fox to lose money.  Do the right thing Fox!  We have waited long enough.",1262304000,15,620,4.581818181818182
3654790,5,B001JAHS50,"Hey Fox since you seem to not give a rats a** about the fans of classic tv, why don't you just sell the rights to The Big Valley to somebody who will put the rest of it out so we can enjoy this classic western .... You have a lot of nerve putting out a season and a half and then just leaving the fans hanging .... Seems pretty rude to me .... Who is your PR guy ? .... Hey he's doing a real bang up job .... Might want to think about promoting him to CEO or something .... Really sucks what you did .... Try to save face and at the very least tell the fans what your intentions are .... I know I won't buy anything with with the Fox lable anymore because you'll never know if you'll get the whole thing or not .... Is somebody listning ???",1252454400,12,740,3.843137254901961
3654791,5,B001JAHS50,"Love The Big Valley.  Loved Barbara Stanwyck.  She was one of the greatest actresses who ever lived, and she was perfect for her role in this series.  The Big Valley is a piece of history that the American public deserves to cherish for another 40 to 50 years.  Fox should release the entire series!  They can always release fewer copies if they think few people will purchase it, but I think many (like myself) are waiting to see if they release it all before we start purchasing it.  I don't want to buy the one and a half seasons that are available only to discover that they don't intend to release the rest.  Release the rest, and we will buy it!!!",1246320000,9,653,4.347107438016529
3654792,5,B001JAHS50,"The 5 stars I gave are for Big Valley, I would give 1 star for Fox.  I think that it is just cruel to release only a season and a half of The Big Valley. I just don't understand it. FYI Fox, most people who purchase a season of a series dvd, do so with the intention of purchasing the entire series. And furthermore, the complete series should be released in a timely manner. Maybe in the future, Fox and others might warn consumers if they have no intention of releasing a series in it's entirety, in a timely matter or maybe not at all. I know if I had had such a warning I would have invested my money in another dvd series....",1245024000,20,630,4.080645161290323
3654793,5,B001JAHS50,I can only guess that they haven't released any more (I would love to see them!)because they haven't sold many.  Is there data anywhere on sales for DVDs of these old shows?,1243641600,7,173,4.40625

3654796,5,B001JAHS50,I love the Big Valley Please release season 3 and 4 soon.  I am such a big Fan of this show and it does not show on TV in my area.,1234310400,7,130,3.193548387096774
3654797,5,B001JAHS50,"First of all let's take a moment to thank FOX for releasing the complete first season, and first half of the second season (yes, that's correct only the first half?? I know, it makes no sense to me either...why scam the fans??) of one of the greatest Westerns of all time-The BIG VALLEY. Thank you Fox :)  :) !
 Now, let's stop for a second and reflect apon LEE MAJORS career; a) All the seasons of the Big Valley-always a big hit...still in sydication; still in demand. b)The Six Million Dollor Man-another great hit from the seventies; a time when achieving more than 3 seasons is a milestone! c) The Fall Guy- probably the most UNDERESTIMATED SHOW OF ALL TIME; For those of you who forgot, each episode starts with a ""James Bond Movie"" stunt sequence; then introduces a great ""1 hour episode"" plot. The writing is second to none, and I am not suprised as everthing GLEN LARSON touches turns to gold. He is a genius!
 I think in light of all this the FOX studios should release the second half of season 2, Season 3, and Season 4 of The BIG VALLEY- ASAP. And furthermore, consider releasing season 2,3,4,5 of the greatest show of all time- THE FALL GUY. Please consider this; time is passing, and none of us are getting any younger! Thank you, The Unknown Stuntfan",1233964800,72,1266,4.495652173913044

3654799,4,B001JAHS50,"Yes, please hurry up and release the following seasons of The Big Valley. It has been too long since the last resease of S2 Vol. 1. Just love the seriousness of the stories mixed with the occassional antics of Nick and Heath! Two great actors.",1227571200,31,243,4.4222222222222225

8312409,4,B001JAHS50,"If you want only one season of THE BIG VALLEY,you should buy season 3. Why? Simply because you have many different kind of episodes. There is a show dealing with the blindness of JARROD during a trial;one which has a doctor who is mentally ill;another in which VICTORIA takes the place of a dead convict etc. The authors actually outdid themselves for most of the season. Although GUNSMOKE and BONANZA were still running at that time,they were on an automatic pilot and THE BIG VALLEY was really the last great western on tlvision. The first half of the season is better than the second. In the last episodes,you won't see AUDRA(LINDA EVANS).",1522713600,,642,4.741071428571429
