4888432,4,B005TC8IL2,"Creepshow 2 is a great sequel and deserves some  more attention. They should've had another episode on this series flick although maybe its hidden and need to find it. My favorite is  the raft  although this freaky blob just devours them all.  the one  with the  wooden indian is great when them thugs steal this old guys gold  and the Wooden statue  comes alive and goes after them with a bow and arrow and an ax.
the last one is  fine in a hit and  run nervous driver  and hits this guys off the side of the road and runs. the guys comes back to life  so to speak  and keeps coming back. They shouldve  had another  because the first one had  4 or 5",1495065600,,651,4.088

I know it got a lot of bad press because it wasn't as good as the original people believed, but at least it stayed true to the same concept of short stories. Purchased this Blu-ray, and got a great deal on it. Beware all of the limited-edition releases of this Blu-ray that are selling for hundreds of dollars because they were only small prints made of them. I'm talking about those ""arrow"" releases.

I give this Blu-ray edition 4 stars based on the quality of the film itself [one of my wife's all-time favorites] and the transfer, which is a bit soft but still the best I've ever seen this film look. Would I love for Shout / Scream Factory to get their hands on the rights to this title and give it their loving Special Edition treatment? You bet I would, but seeing as this film is so often overlooked I'll just assume it's never going to happen and content myself with this one.",1461715200,,687,4.631147540983607

4888455,3,B005TC8IL2,"Creepshow 2 comes to HD on Blu Ray
thanks to Image Entertainment who during the laserdisc and dvd era put out ultra HQ editions with cool exclusives and they actually gave a damn
as of late it's hit and miss this (Ceepshow 2) being a miss
The HD picture quality isn't terrible by any means but, it's also a bit off and very cheap (very much a rush job)
Is it better then the dvd???  without a doubt......... but, it's not on par with a Scream Factory or Arrow Video release
This BR much like WB US release of the original Creepshow  is a bare bones release with nothing
So if you still have the out of print Anchor Bay Special Edition Creepshow 2 I'd hold onto it if I were you
(I've checked around there is no Special Collectors Edition of Creepshow 2 on BR in region A,B, or C )
The BR is in the middle as far as a HQ blu ray that show's off what HD should look like.  (I've seen much worse though)
The audio is decoded in  DTS-HD  Master Audio Stereo
It's a pretty weak sounding DTS Master I'd say it's DTS-Mono you get little to no surround sound which isn't a huge deal but,
I wish there didn't put on the back cover art DTS-HD  Master Audio Stereo

The film as a whole is a strong follow up to the original Creepshow
(If you are a fan of this film get the Special Edition dvd by Anchor Bay the Audio Commentary is very interesting and adds a lot of insight to Creepshow 2)
The film's wrap around is now  animated  (and looks pretty good very EC Comics looking)
you get 3  stories
 1) ""Old Chief Wood'n head  (Staring George Kennedy,  Dorothy Lamour , and a very young Holt McCallany
anyone who's seen this film loves this story it's near perfect you have two  iconic film actor's who get killed off and the Wooden Indian Chief that takes revenge for them......
(2) ""The Raft  (Is retro 1950's Horror with a 80's twist of blood and gore very slick builds tension and suspense the proper way)It's very much like Night of the Living Dead minus the Zombie but, on a Raft it might sound a little strange but,, it works
Even the ending climax is a  George A. Romero middle finger to Hollywood
(3) ""The Hitchhiker""  (Starring Lois Chiles,  Tom Wright  (as The Hitchhiker) Tom Wright went on to do a lot of stuff he's one of those amazing character actors that can take any role and make it his own!  and a cameo by Stephen King
The Hitchhiker is a Alfred Hitchcock love letter it's very psychological but, also very brilliant on how humans react to trauma and what are brain does to ""us""
If you never seen this film or this story (This last story on it's own might seem very much like a simple SNL type running gag)  It's not it's actually very deep and smart but, also very dark it's one of those segments you have to view a few times to fully understand what they were trying to say  and when you fully understand it's extremely jarring........

While it's super cheap snatch this up $5.99 even without the extras and the so/so VQ it's still a real steal for a Image Blu Ray
or wait until the licencing rights go to the likes of a Shout Factory
The film itself deserves more respect and a real Collector's Edition with Extras and maybe even new exclusives it's not on the same level as the original Creepshow but, it comes very close  8/10",1443398400,3,3240,4.265139116202946

4888474,3,B005TC8IL2,"BOTTOM LINE: It was OK to re-visit CREEPSHOW 2 after not having seen it in 20+ years, but honestly I probably won't be re-watching it again anytime soon. I remember it being a lot better than it actually was, but I was a LOT younger then, too. If you're an undiscriminating horror fan or a completist who insists on having all of everything in a franchise or genre then it might be worth it, but save yourself some dough and buy this used, like I did. Just skip this lifeless, by-the-numbers sequel and just watch the original twice. I would actually rate this film 2.5 stars, but Amazon only allows full star increments so I upped my rating to 3 STARS instead of 2 because, truly, there are a LOT worse films out there. I know. I've watched many of them.

Too bad more attention wasn't paid to this follow-up to the first CREEPSHOW. This sequel suffers from some really sloppy writing and exceptionally bad overacting. Granted, fans of this genre usually don't expect acting quality on par with Shakespere's ""Hamlet"" but honestly the acting quality here borders, at times, on the level of a third grade Christmas Pageant. George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour are the only pros in sight, and they do a serviceable (if simplistic) job in their roles as the two kindly store proprietors in the first and best of the three stories, ""Ol' Chief Woodenhead."" The problem is that everyone else is just plain AWFUL. The three villains in this particular segment are gag-inducing. The director & editor look to have just used the first takes for every single shot. The director apparently didn't bother with any additional takes, insightful advice or motivational suggestions to the actors in order to get better performances from them. It would appear that the filmmakers figured that whatever they got on film would be good enough, as long as the actors said all of their lines, the camera was in focus and the sets were lit well enough so that you could see what was happening. What a shame. (If you want to see this same basic story done MUCH better, buy Mill Creek's 1966 ""DaiMajin"" trilogy on Blu-ray.)

The ""monster"" in the second tale, ""The Raft,"" must have set the film's producers back a whopping $5, since it clearly looks like nothing more than a big, green, Vaseline-coated tarp floating around in a pond. The story? Four stereotypical high school kids (jock, nerd, slut, shy girl)  drive out to a remote (and admittedly beautiful) location in the Jock's bitchin' yellow Camero, strip down to their Speedos and swim out to a tiny wooden raft in the middle of a small, secluded pond. Once there, they quickly proceed to get stoned, make out, argue and then get eaten, one-by-one, by a mysterious living oil slick/snot blob. The irritating performances in this segment, (by actors who are all clearly in their late 20's - early 30's), are on par with the interchangeable machete-fodder victims found in any Friday the 13th sequel. The girls are kind of cute and the slimy creature attack effects are nicely done, but that's about it.

Sadly, the last entry in the film is not even an original tale, by any means, (sorry, Mr. King). If it seems vaguely familiar to you, that's because it was done to much, much better effect in an episode of the old Twilight Zone TV show. Again, the writing is really sloppy and shows no attention to detail. As with the acting, the producers & crew apparently used the first draft of the script without trying to refine or improve on it. King seems to have been sleepwriting his way through this one. And the wrap-around story for this movie is pretty dumb, too. Done in a Ralph Bakshi-style animation, it concerns a wimpy kid who sicks giant Venus Flytraps on some bullies who pick on him. It's really lame, and like ALL THREE stories presented here, you can see the ending coming from a mile away. There's no surprise or twist to them at all. Lastly, the idea of having a segment host for the film may have seemed like a cool idea, but the character, unimaginatively named ""The Creep"" - both in live action & in animated form - is far more comical than he is scary. He looks more like Ebenezer Scrooge after an all-night eggnog bender than a terrifying specter from beyond the grave.

THE BLU-RAY: Hi-def format of CREEPSHOW 2 is a bare-bones affair, which stinks. On the positive side, the picture looks good and the sound is clean & clear. Still, it would be nice if there were a making of, interviews with cast & crew or something... anything, but it is what it is.",1391904000,,4501,4.62125
4888475,3,B005TC8IL2,"This one had me a little disappointed but at the same time I found myself intrigued.

Pros: I did like the fact that it sort of resembled a ""Tales from the Crypt"" vibe in between stories. The stories had it's moments plus you can't expect anything less from an 80's horror classic.
Cons: There wasn't but only 3 stories in this one. The movie was only 89 minutes long (because it only had the 3 stories). The stories was good but they didn't top the first. And last but not least the kid and the ghoul in between stories was a little cheesy. Although some of the transitions in between stories with the ghoul kind of reminded me of ""Tales from the Crypt"" so I count that as a little bit of a win.

Point being if you are looking for something that would top the original Creepshow classic I wouldn't hold my breath. However if you just want a good ol' fashion horror flick from the 80's to watch just for a fairly good time then this one is for you.",1389052800,,949,4.208791208791209
4888476,2,B005TC8IL2,"The rotting Creep himself is back with 3 new gruesome tales of horror that will make your skin crawl: a cigar store wooden Indian comes to life to avenge the store owner's brutal murder at the hands of three punks in ""Ol' Chief Woodenhead."" Then 4 teenagers become the target of a terrifying, man-eating oil slick in ""The Raft.""

The chills continue with ""The Hitchhiker,"" the chilling tale of a woman who keeps running into, and over, the same mutilated man on a lonely road. Prepare for a terrifying roller coaster ride from the masters of horror!

Unfortunately CREEPSHOW II didn't do nearly as well at the box office during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1987 didn't do nearly as well as George Romero's CREEPSHOW did back in the Fall of 1982 since this sequel only contained 3 tales of comic book stories as opposed to its predecessor containing 5 comic book stories.

This thriller also takes me back to memory lane to when it was theatrically released on Friday May 1, 1987 when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade.",1387324800,,1031,4.562162162162162

The Raft is my favorite, and I'll never look at oil spills the same way again.  The Hitch-hiker (THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY) was fun and unruly and enjoyable.

Although the film consists of only three short horror stories (with animated intervals) there were originally five stories written. One of these, ""The Cat From Hell"", was later used in the the similar anthology film ""Tales From The Darkside: The Movie"", released in 1990, and directed by the original Creepshow's composer, John Harrison. The other story originally intended to be in Creepshow 2 was the Stephen King short story, ""Pinfall"", about ghostly rival bowling teams.

'Ol Chief Woodenhead - Rating: B-. This one is dark but fairly tame.
The Raft - Rating: A. One of my old favorites and now considered essential viewing for horror freaks.
The Hitchhiker - Rating: B. Very creepy and cool. Reminds me of The Hitcher. We couldn't stop talking about it at first.",1377734400,13,1920,4.934984520123839

8486024,3,B005TC8IL2,"This review is for the Blu-ray version of 'Creepshow 2' released by Image Entertainment in September 2013.

BLU-RAY & EXTRA'S: The picture is just OK. For Blu-ray quality it's not the best I've seen. There is another release out at the time (Arrow Video) of this review for this movie in Blu-Ray. I'm not sure if the quality is better on that one but it sells for a lot more money at the time of this review.
This version has no extra's or subtitles.

PLOT/COMMENTS: This is an anthology movie. It has a framing story along with 3 short stories.

The first story involves an old couple who live in a southwestern ghost town. The old man (George Kennedy) has a wooden Indian on the porch of his general store. He refuses to leave or close the store despite the population of the town having dwindled to next to nothing. The town is so poor that the locals rarely pay any more and just 'borrow' from the store. One day an old Indian shows up with a packet of his tribes most valuable possessions. He asks the store owner to keep them until they pay him back. This way they can have their honor and are 'borrowers, and not ,takers.'
Unfortunately, a young tribe member has found out about the 'gift.' He  has plans on going to Hollywood and being a star and he needs money. He shows up along with a few friends looking for money.
To me, this was the best of the 3 stories. It wasn't great, but it was OK and like most stories of this type, very predictable. From here the quality of the stories go south.

The second story involves a group of 4 teens. They show up at a lake that doesn't appear to be well known. There is nobody there but they may be due to the fact that the water temperature is very cold. The 4 teens brave the cold and swim out to floating dock in the middle of the lake. As they are swimming to the dock they notice what looks like an oil sludge devouring a couple of birds. The sludge has a mind of it's own and heads for the teens.
This was a very weak story with almost nothing going for it. It looks as if the principal photography could have been completed in an afternoon with some special effects added in later. Typical in a movie involving brash teens, they are all idiots. There does not seem to be even one that has brains.

The third story is about a married woman who is out cheating on her husband. She wakes up late and is in a rush to get home so she doesn't blow her cover story. Unfortunately for her, she has an unfortunate encounter with a hitch-hiker.
This story is unimaginative and pure fantasy. I could pretty much predict the plot within minutes of the beginning and couldn't wait for it to end.

The framing story which starts out as live action changes to cartoon form as the stories begin. I guess to stay with the 'comic book' look of the movie. Though they don't really do much with the comic book angle.
Anyway, the framing story involves a kid who gets the latest issue of 'Creepshow' and receives his order from the comic of a venus flytrap. Some bullies come along and take away his plant and from here it leads to a completely illogical, but not unexpected, ending.

Ultimately, this is a very uninspired sequel.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'm giving this 3 stars out of 5 even though it's more like 2 1/2 stars. Let's call it 5 or 6/10. It really is not a very good movie nor is it terrible. The problem is that there is just nothing here that you haven't seen or what seems like a hundred times before. If you had never seen a horror movie in your life then this might seem like a good movie. If you are a horror movie fan then there are plenty of other better movies and/or horror anthologies that came before this one. I can think of several by Hammer and Amicus.

Recommended for fans of the first 'Creepshow' who want to have the complete collection (There are just 2).",1512691200,,3819,4.299026425591099
