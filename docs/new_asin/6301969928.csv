The film comes to a climax in the village of the  insane, where oddly enough, one finds a stone pommel horse in the town  square. In a dramatic scene, he fends off the insane villagers with the  now-famous Thomas twist on the pommel horse.

396470,5,6301969928,"There's been a surge of interest in ""good bad"" movies lately. Movies that certainly aren't going to crack the top levels of critical rankings, and that probably flopped terribly at theaters, but movies which have redeeming qualities that make them a lot of fun to watch. For fans of this genre, Gymkata is a tour de force.

How to describe it? In the 1980s there was a push to find new summer blockbusters featuring action heroes. This was an era where movies like ""Rambo: First Blood"" would take flight. It seemed like a smart bet at the time that olympic athletes, with their amazing physiques and their existing media coverage, would make great movie stars. The problem is, these movies almost universally flopped to a remarkable extent. Another movie from this era was the Village People's ""Can't Stop the Music"" starring a certain person whose last name is Jenner. ""Can't Stop the Music"" is almost as good-bad as Gymkata.

Who's our gold medalist? Our hero is Kurt Thomas. You'd imagine he's a track star, a weightlifter, or a boxer? A wrestler, obviously. But no- he's a gymnast. That's right, out action hero is a gymnast. You're probably going to say that's ridiculous. What is he doing to do, cartwheel into a bag guy or spin around on a pommel horse as bad guys run up to him one by one to get kicked in the face? Why yes, that is precisely what happens. Bad movie fans are probably already sold- but there's so much more.

Oh, the insanity. Firstly, the plot takes place in the made-up Eastern European nation of Parmistan. I'd like to warn you that the depiction of the Parmistanians is an incredibly racist depiction of the real-life residents of Yugoslavia who were probably blissfully unaware of the way they would be depicted in the movie. There are a lot of close-ups of old people with missing teeth as they cheer the death of prisoners, very culturally sensitive. Parmistan is led by an obviously Jewish king, who runs ""The Game"". The Game is a sort of triathlon where ninjas and gladiators randomly murder participants. That doesn't really seem fair, but such is The Game. The United States has to send a gymnast to win The Game in order to get a missile defense system installed so that the United States can win the Cold War. Are you sold yet? There's more!

Yes, abject insanity. At one point our hero goes to the City of the Crazies, a place full of cannibals, where things get downright experimental. After watching a man sever his own arm after grabbing a hot pipe, our hero finds that pommel horse in the middle of a town square so that he can kick people in the face for a few minutes. Our hero then fights a man who has a mask on the back of his head, making it looks like the man is still facing him even when he gets turned around. What producer thought this was a good idea? How did this make it onto the big screen? I haven't even mentioned the asian karate master, the princess who must be saved, or the hero of Parmistan opposing our who's obviously some American athlete who can't even do an accent.

I don't want to spoil any more, but at this point you should know if this movie is for you. It's not a good movie by any means, there are long stretches of boredom and quaint-because-it's-the-80s racism against all non-Americans. But there are so many great moments in this movie. Our hero bounds, leaps, and has a unibrow. This movie should be a legend as it so perfectly encapsulates the insane things people thought could be legitimate blockbusters in this era.

396475,4,6301969928,"While I am giving this film four stars, because I did truly enjoy the film, this is not a Four Star film in general. It is a Four Star film for a very particular audience that enjoys the awkward attempts of the early American Martial Arts Film Industry to capture the excitement and magic of the genre. This film is at its core an attempt to leverage the success of an Olympic athlete with what was a growing interest in martial arts and ninja movies. As a film in its own right, GYMKATA is pretty terrible, but as an ironically viewed artifact of its age, it is high entertainment.

The basic plot of the film is that the US Government trains a gymnast in martial arts so that he can complete a kind of lethal Ninja Warrior-esque game of death or victory. If he wins, the US will be able to place missile monitoring equipment in the nation, if he fails he dies. The protagonists father has already tried to win the game, and lost with fatal consequences.

This is a downright silly premise. The martial arts choreography, cinematography, sound design, and acting aren't much better.

But if you can accept the premise of the film and go all in to embrace the film, which is not intentionally campy and takes itself seriously, you are in for quite a good time. This is a film to watch in an 80s Martial Arts Movie Marathon along with Enter the Ninja, The Octagon, and Revenge of the Ninja. Everyone will have a good time, but no one will have watched great cinema.",1490227200,,1464,4.4148148148148145

High level martial arts talents Richard Norton, Tadashi Yamashita, Conan Lee, and John Barrett are vastly underutilized and wasted in this! The obviously non existent Parmistan and the part when Thomas finds a pommell horse in a crazy town are the goofy highlights. The pros- plenty to laugh at. Unintentional comedy involving excessive voice overs, falling fake dummies, bad acting, and epic skull crushing sound effects that are over-utilized. Kurt Thomas is actually good in the many fight scenes, Richard Norton and Bob schott are great villians and the soundtrack is too good for this flick!

396654,3,6301969928,"Olympic gymnast Kurt Thomas kicks, whips, chips, chops, and shackle-hoofs his way through a rather cardboard script in the film ""Gymkata"", which uses a little read novel called ""The Terrible Game"" by Dan Tyler Moore (I know it's little read because I still haven't read it!) as a springboard for a non-stop martial arts chaos fest, and the results are fun if terribly insubstantial. But really, do you crave a script very much in a movie filled with this much chase, violence, and thrilling action? This is one of those action/martial arts pictures that was shown on TBS back in the good ol' days (when films like ""Bloodsport"" and ""I Come in Peace"" were on every other day), so I have partially fond memories of it; however, I have to say that it is crammed with wall-to-wall music and noisiness after hearing it on the DVD transfer, and it is a loud and fast moving romp (not to be taken completely seriously, but it's patriotism and ambitions are in the right place). I was positively exhausted after watching all of the non-stop action in this one, so it may be too much of a good thing, but in many ways I still like it a lot, as a go-for-broke martial arts/Olympic medalist kind of B-movie example (I do like the way that the film looks), and it calls to mind other non-stop chase/fight movies such as the pedal-to-the-medal action of ""Game of Death II"" (a Bruceploitation classic).
As for the Warner Brothers issued DVD, there is a very noisy (but not extremely clean) soundtrack transfer, and the picture is a good enough quality to pass for an Amazon.com distribution poll (reminds of Edgar Wright demanding that they release ""Super Cops"" on DVD because otherwise there would be a serious re-release injustice taking place). Alright guys, since Amazon.com is getting into the movie business now, who is going to be the first to write a sequel to ""Gymkata""? C'mon, any takers? (A theatrical trailer is included.)

396733,3,6301969928,"A camp classic and one-time staple of late-night cable, Gymkata stars former Olympic gymnast Kurt Thomas as a master of Gymkata, a fighting style that blends elements of martial arts and--what else?--gymnastics. Sent to a fictional Middle Eastern country on the Caspian Sea called ""Karabal, on the Caspian Sea,"" Jonathan Cabot (Kurt Thomas) must survive a high-stakes competition called the Game that had previously claimed the life of his father. But winning could mean shifting the balance of power in the cold war.

(The movie was made in 1985, and Thomas missed out on the 1980 Olympics because of the U.S. boycott.) Fortunately, being a master of Gymkata means that as you run through the village streets with bad guys in hot pursuit, in between the buildings you'll find a conveniently placed high bar from which you can swing and unleash powerful villain-crunching kicks. Moments like that earn Gymkata a 9.5 on the unintentional-comedy scale. With Tetchie Agbayani as the love-interest princess, and Buck Kartalian as a fearsome villain who looks like Mel Brooks.

The game is actually deadly, and the main advisary of Jonathan's, is a man that is not only pre-arranged to marry the princess. But also intends to overthrow the princess' dad & take over his power! Jonathan uses what he learned from what he trained. And his gymnastic skills to fight for survival,get the girl back, and save her father's life & power. Okay.....So here's my criticism of the film. When I watched it as a kid in the 80's, it was great! It was a new film, it has action, the princess was easy on the eyes,it had ninjas!!!!! So as a kid I really thought it was a great flick! I had forgot the name of the film. I tried to youtube and Google it, but had no luck finding it's title or anything of the film. Yesterday I was @ a Hastings store & was looking for a completely different flick, when I found this. Finally!!!! I thought to myself.....one of those bad a** flicks from my childhood is found. Then I watched it that night. Needless to say....it hasn't aged well in my opinion (With the exception of the princess that is, lol). The acting is a lot cheesier than I remember,the action at times is choppy.....you can see the cut and paste editing of the scenes/takes,the story is just kinda so-so. Overall this movie made me question what exactly I found so amazing about this flick!?! I mean, yeah, I still thought the scene with the pummel horse was cool. And it was still cool t see for the nostalgia factor. But aside from that not much else was there like in my youth days. All in all I'd recommend buying this super cheap for the nostalgia factor. And for those that feel they'd still like it as much as they did back in the 80's (or early 90's if you saw it then?). I bought it @ Hastings for like $6.45. And I'm wishing I just remembered the name & got it off amazon for like 65 cents + shipping. At least I would've saved a tiny bit on a film that just doesn't do it for me like it did for the 7yr old me.",1391904000,,2398,4.237991266375546

In fact, they took the tape from me and just smashed it on the ground-further proving how little taste and intelligence they had-I knew it was their loss.

396829,3,6301969928,"Ah, ""Gymkata."" For how many years had I heard about this film before actually watching it for myself? Obviously too many, since the movie didn't match my growing expectations. As a guy who doesn't let the opinions of (many) people sway his decisions of what to watch, I disregarded the critiques and LOLs of folks who've bashed this movie, believing that even if the film was incredibly goofy, it might sate me with some nice action scenes like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;did. Sadly, this was not the case: ""Gymkata"" is merely plain goofy, as opposed to incredibly goofy, and its action content - despite being unusual - doesn't really hit the spot. Succinctly, it's not nearly as entertaining as I had hoped for.

The story: champion gymnast Jonathan Cabot (real-life gymnastics champ Kurt Thomas) is selected by the US government to act as their entry to a deadly contest organized by the tiny, violent monarchy-nation of Parmistan to decide which country will have rights to its strategic missile defense site.

The movie actually draws on the actual, controversial ""Star Wars"" missile defense system from the 1980s as a major plot point, so one's personal politics and opinion of history might weigh in to your impression of the movie. Me, I'm just disappointed that the producers went with such a contrived plot to begin with: though the screenplay is loosely adapted from Dan Tyler Moore's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/B000FA9B6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel </a>&nbsp;about an isolated nation subjecting outsiders to grisly contests, the film's theatrical trailer focuses almost entirely on its namesake - the gymnastics-karate hybrid martial art gymkata (not actually mentioned by name in the movie). This concept is interesting enough, if you ask me, and director Robert Clouse's best-known picture -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/B004GJYRKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>&nbsp;- proves that he works best with simple storylines. The movie rushes through both character and story development to get to its forced premise of a pseudo-medieval country that its coherency suffers: there's just too much story here for a 90-minute feature, and a lot of its subsequent weirdness is the result of minimal or nonexistent exposition.

I'm not sure what to make of Kurt Thomas. On one hand, he's not a great actor and clearly no martial artist, but I'm nevertheless disappointed by the critical bashing the film received: along with his nomination for a Razzie Award, this probably deterred him from pursuing many more movie roles, despite what I perceive as promising potential. His athleticism is unquestionable, and even though some of the physical setups we see here are crude and heavy-handed, the gratuitous flipping and acrobatic moves foreshadow the style of action that future Hong Kong and Thai pictures would bring to cinema. More disappointingly, the presence of legitimate martial arts movie stars is, for the most part, wasted: Tadashi Yamashita (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja/dp/B00005N89J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja</a>) and John Barrett (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Kickboxer/dp/B000AYEL1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Kickboxer</a>) don't fight at all, and Hong Kong veterans Conan Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiger-on-Beat/dp/630526144X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiger on Beat</a>) and Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>) only get one so-so fight apiece. The obstacles encountered in the game don't really offer themselves to great action...although I have to admit that the ""Village of the Crazies"" scene is effectively creepy and exciting. Video game fans, don't you think that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-4/dp/B0002A6CQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;got a few ideas from this sequence?

The movie's sense of morality - encapsulated by the treachery of Richard Norton's character against the ruler of the kingdom (Buck Kartalian,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B000E6ESEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Apes</a>) - is severely flawed, but it adds to the movie's sizeable B-movie charm. I really don't know whether Robert Clouse purposely sought out increasingly goofy projects like this after his work with Bruce Lee or just got (un)lucky, but when it comes to weirdness, this is definitely one of his weirdest. ""Gymkata"" isn't awful by B-movie standards but it's also not great, for better or worse. It'd be great to see an updated version of this with fight choreography that was more sure of itself, but beyond that, I'm glad I settled for a rental with this one.",1343520000,,5231,6.654465592972182

396881,3,6301969928,"Rating ""Gymkata"" is an exercise in futility. I ended up with three stars, all for unintentional hilarity. The concept of making world champion gymnast Kurt Thomas (as Jonathan Cabot) train in a totally new style of martial art combining traditional fighting techniques with gymnastics, then sending him on a secret mission to ""Parmistan"" to secure a base for a US ""Star Wars"" operation makes the mind reel. Needless to say the movie is wildly unsuccessful as a serious action film, but is rife with comedic moments.

Thomas' acting is more wooden than any of the oaks, beeches, or larches he spends the better part of the movie running through, not than even an accomplished thespian could make much of this mess. You know you're in for a rough ride when the film starts with clips of a gymnastic routine intercut with a stampede of Mongols riding horses. We then get the backstory about the whole Star Wars base in Parmistan. Since the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI,) commonly referred to as ""Star Wars"" in the press, used satellites, how is it they need this one forsaken strip of land in the Hindu Kush? Explain, please. Anyway, suspending disbelief just a bit more, he trains for two months by chopping wood and walking up stairs on his hands so he can compete in ""The Game"" which has not been won by a non-Parmistanian in 900 years. It's a savage game and involves spears, ropes, impalings, etc. But Jonathan has no issues competing as his father had previously disappeared in Parmistan playing the Game. Understand that the winner of the game gets to live, and the Parmistan government grants the winner one wish, which Thomas will use to get the Star Wars base. Of course governments in that part of the world are just known for being reputable, honorable, and keeping their word, so I can't see any problems with this premise in the least.

Jonathan, of course, falls in love with Princess Rubali (Tetchie Agbayani), who is to be wed to the evil Zamir (Richard Norton), because the idiot King (Buck Kartalian) trusts him, despite the obvious facts that Zamir is effectively running the country for his own nefarious purposes. Ironically, ""Gymkata"" was filmed in Yugoslavia before a very real civil war tore it apart just a couple of years later. How's that for foreshadowing? To help him blend into the crowd of gray-clad Eastern Europeans, Thomas elects to play the Game in a bright red shirt. His plan is certainly cunning. The Game itself is a procession of ugly people doing ugly things to other ugly people, and features such poignant vignettes as some sort of monk in a buttock-baring hospital robe attempting to distract him to death, the worst pig feeding scene (with accompanying ridiculous escape) in movie history, and, my personal favorite scene in the film, when he beats up an entire village using a pommel horse thoughtfully placed in the middle of the village square for the use of death-gymnasts. This must be seen to be believed.

Much of the chase is in slow motion (as if the movie needed to drag on longer,) but when it wraps up it concludes very quickly with the stunning revelation that Jonathan's Dad is still alive, although within about two minutes of Jonathan's arrival his Dad gets shot in the back, which results in the ultimate one on one gymkata vengeance round, while simultaneously the King and Princess (in a lovely all black catsuit) start a revolution (or anti-revolution, if you like) to take control back from Zamir. Obviously Jonathan wins the Princess' heart and a title card tells us that the US built its Star Wars station in Parmistan in 1985.

This movie is utterly relentless in its badness. The concept, casting, direction, and acting are universally terrible. Thomas is completely unviable as an actor, and the film fails on any serious level. It does wildly succeed as an example of anti-art, and is worth examination by lovers of cheesy movies everywhere (it would have made an excellent episode of MST3K.) The only good thing about the film is the excellent and wholly suitable Yugoslav location, which was a great (and low cost) touch.

Extras are slim; I would have loved to hear a commentary track from Thomas and noted martial arts director Robert Clouse. Instead all that's offered is a theatrical trailer for the film and a bonus (and extremely incongruous) trailer for ""The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning"" starring Willie Nelson, which looks, if anything, even worse than ""Gymkata,"" which may be the precise reason it's featured as an extra here. It's a futile attempt to make ""Gymkata"" look better by comparison, but at this point there's really nothing to do but grasp at straws.",1270771200,11,4651,4.830614805520702

As for the movie itself, it is so bad it is good, and it is tremendously funny at times. Some say that Gymkata is an unintentional comedy, but such a view requires an unimaginable level of incompetence on the part of the movie's producers, writers, and director. I suspect that the ridiculous campiness and the spoofing of the martial arts genre were intentional. Consider the line from our hero, Jonathan Cabot, as he tells the main villain to put his weapons away: ""You can put your hardware back in your pants now."" And then there is the exciting scene when the princess tears off her regal gown to reveal the sexy black ninja tights underneath. And the inexplicable scene when a crazy person deliberately cuts off his own hand. Or the touching moment when Jonathan hugs the father he thought was dead and the father is shot in the back with an arrow, but later comes back to town on horseback, still with the arrow sticking out of his back but otherwise looking fine. Stuff like this MUST be intentional! The only complaint I have is that none of the movie's worst villains die horribly or funny enough.

Gymkata is no exception, either. I saw this movie when I was 12, I think. We were all gymnasts back then, and there was this crazy move from Gymkata that we kept trying to do (when he is talking with the Princess, and playing the role of both parties). This movie had everything in it; love story, drama, suspense, comedy, thriller, and then some. I absolutely love this movie for the sheer cheesyness of it all. The princess is supposed to be Kurt Thomas' trainer, but never really teaches him anything, except an inferred, ""Don't trust anyone."" If you look closely, you'll see some recycled scenery. And I love when he's running through the town trying not to get shot; mind you, he decides to run in a RED sweater. Yes, he might as well have painted a big bulls eye on himself. And how his hands magically have chalk on them, and how poles are conveniently placed between buildings during chase. This is classic stuff. The story line talks about how all the nations of the world are training their fighters for the ""Game,"" yet, only about 6 fighters show up. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this movie, because it is sooooo cheesy and fun to watch. The sound effects are the same for every move during hand to hand combat. Plus, you will get a kick out of watching Kurt Thomas in the town of the crazies. My recommendation is that you purchase this oh so awesome film. It's one of a kind. Cheers!

396907,5,6301969928,"Based on the 1957 novel, The Terrible Game, the filmmakers' first misstep was changing the title to Gymkata. (We would have opted for a more modest adjustment, and called it simply, The Terrible Movie.) The Terrible Game is actually The Most Dangerous Game, as designed by the President's Council on Physical Fitness. It requires the player to run around and climb a rope, and we're told that only a select few people in the world can meet this grueling challenge: either world-class gymnasts, like American champion Kurt Thomas, or 11-year olds who've passed sixth-grade gym.

The film opens with an angry white man -- Kurt's dad, who's apparently playing on the Terrible Game Senior Tour -- attempting to cross the rope bridge at Camp Snoopy. Richard Norton (who we know is evil because he's wearing Sonny Bono's sheepskin vest from Wild on the Beach) shoots an arrow into Kurt's dad, who falls to his death.

Cut to the United States, where the Olympic Games are being held in a high-school auditorium.

American champion Kurt Thomas dismounts the parallel bars, and is immediately recruited by the CIA to play The Game, which is held in Parmistan, a mountain kingdom ruled by ""the Khan."" Kurt will be trained by Princess Ruballi, the Khan's daughter, and even though she spends the first half of the film attempting to do grievous harm to his groin (knee it, stab it, rope-burn it, etc.), Ruballi eventually becomes Kurt's love interest, because she's the only person in the film who's shorter than he is.

Kurt and the Princess white-water raft into Parmistan, where they're promptly attacked by Himalayan ninjas (clad in black Dr. Dentons). Hopelessly outnumbered, Kurt unleashes the secret martial art of Gymkata, and manages to overcome his assailants using the deadly power of Olga Korbut's compulsory floor routine from the '72 Olympics.

Once in the capital, Kurt and the other competitors meet the Khan, (apparently a member of The Davy Crockett Hair Club for Men), who explains the rules: Basically, you run around and climb on various pieces of playground equipment until someone shoots you with an arrow. If Kurt wins, the U.S. will be allowed to build a ""Star Wars"" satellite-tracking station in Parmistan. If Kurt loses, he will be killed in the traditional way: shot with an arrow while playing the ""Smack the Mole"" game at a Chuck E. Cheese.

The next morning, the Khan announces that Sheepskin will wed Princess Ruballi after the game, with a reception to follow at Medieval Times restaurant. Then the competitors are off and running. Amazingly, Kurt makes it across the rope bridge without getting shot by an arrow, and enters ""The Village of the Damned,"" -- a planned community for the criminally insane. No one has ever escaped alive from this blood-soaked bedlam, and it is soon apparent why. In short order, Kurt is attacked by a man with a sickle, beaten to a pulp by a pack of Italian grandmothers, and mooned. Finally, the entire populace converges on Kurt, shrieking and waving various farm implements as they surround him in the village square. Fortunately, next to the communal well is the communal pommel horse. Leaping onto it, Kurt manages to kill the axe-wielding maniacs with a quick and deadly series of Magyar and Sivado cross-travel variations.

The surviving villagers give Kurt a 9.2.

The crazed peasants chase Kurt into a blind alley, forcing him to climb a sheer wall, but he's too much of a pussy to reach the top. Surprisingly, one of the Himalayan ninjas reaches down and pulls Kurt to safety. He then peels off the black mask and reveals that he is, in fact, . . .Kurt's dad! It turns out that he wasn't killed in that fall after all, just maimed. Their tearful reunion is interrupted when Sheepskin shoots Kurt's dad with an arrow ...again! Springing into action, Kurt heroically jumps onto a horse ...and rides away. Sheepskin catches up to our fleeing hero and gives him a well-deserved thrashing. But Kurt cleverly goes into ""rope-a-dope,"" outlasting his opponent until they get to the page in the script where it says he wins. Sheepskin takes a dive, and Kurt proudly rides back into town with Dad, who's been maimed some more, but is otherwise just fine. Now, at last, everyone knows the truth: Sheepskin is a traitor, and Kurt's dad is Rasputin.

Oh ...,

and Kurt wins The Game -- But if you ask us, he won ugly.",1185667200,8,4368,4.835341365461847

396911,5,6301969928,"I know there have been a ton of gymnastics/karate movies made in the last 25 years, but the buck stops here. Gymkata is the reason Edison created the motion picture camera. The director Robert Clouse has created Profound storytelling on an epic scope.

From the opening credits Jonathan is whisked away to an enchanted land of evil, danger and incredible beauty. imitation is the highest form of flattery, too true.  Mel Gibson recently tried to recreate the action, excitement, and drama of Gymkata's ""Game of Death"" with his own film Apacolypto.  Nice try Mel.  The Game Of Death concept featured in Gymkata, is by far the best example of mans effort to out run the demons of his life, whether they be external, or internal. not even the glorious countryside locations of passolini's Gospel According to ST. Mathew can compare to the portrayl of one of the worlds most diverse, bountaful, and gorgeous country-lands  Parmastan.  A first class trip to Parmastan? yes please

Some say that Francis Ford Copala's Appocolypse Now is the ultimate film example of mans quest in to the darkest regions of the human soul.  For my money, its Gymkatas twisted journey into ""the village of the damned"" with its oh so realistic action, and stunning use of slow motion The village of the Damned is one of the most breath taking, horrofying, astonishing sequences in film history. How Jonathan makes it out with his mind, body, and soul intact is beyond me.

Bogart and Becall, Astaire and Rogers, Pitt and Jolie, what do these on screen couple have in common? they are ice cold next to the red hot on screen romance of Jonathan, and Princess Rubali. love at first sight is an understatement, when these to fated lovers first meet eyes the silver screen is leteraly set on fire with the pure energy of untamed attraction.

There is too much Raw Cinema Power involved in Gymkata to squeez into a single foulable review.  You will just have to trust me.  However, I will leave you with this last thought:  I bet when you visited Amazon.com today you had no idea you would find a DVD that was guarateed to change your life.",1172188800,6,2108,4.7111716621253406
396912,5,6301969928,"Kurt Thomas is at his best in this Oscar-worthy performance.  Pestered by the annoying and sometimes mute princess of Parmistan, Kurt begins a training regimen that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger cower in fear.  Walking up stairs on his hands, doing backflips, and holding mock conversations with himself prepares Kurt for the horrors of the Parmistan contryside during ""The Game.""

Not even a little anti-American sentiment that's been running around can deter Kurt from his goal of securing the strategically important S.D.I. (Star Wars) site for the U.S. Government.  The ""grand tradition"" of the game, which has been played for hundreds of years, involves the dramatic practice of simply dropping a rope. Let The Game begin!

The ability to climb ropes, evade Parmistanian forces, and slay 87 year old female zombies is essential to success in The Game.  The movie contains the heart wrenching reunion of Kurt with his long lost father...who is subsequently speared with an arrow while attempting to catch up on old times with Kurt.  Fortunately, Kurt is able to overcome this horrific event, and make a triumphant return to the castle alongside the princess.  Kurt is even nice enough to allow his father to ride horseback, with said arrow still firmly lodged in his back.

Truly, this movie was ahead of its time.  Kurt's performance was so magical, he decided to end his Hollywood career after this film.  Once you've reached the mountaintop, there really is nowhere to go but down, I guess.

individuals must complete a tricky journey through woodlands and

villages whilst evading attack by killer ninjas and of course, each

other! The last man standing will win The Game. Suffice it to say there

396948,5,6301969928,"Extremely reminiscent of cold war sleepers like ""Gorky Park"" and ""Reds"", Gymkata is one of the most carefully scripted and brooding commentaries on American foreign policy during the Reagan years. The film is more like a documentary than a work of fiction in its deep attention to historical accuracies and avoidance of hyperbole.

Robert Clouse's directorial adaption of Dan Tyler Moore's Pulitzer-shortlisted novel manages to capture timbre of the times and the voice of the decade in a script of intricate complexity.  Kurt Thomas's portrayal of the hero across from Tetchie Agbayani's heroine is one of the most dynamic and surprising chemistries since Bogart and Bergman's 43 years before.

However, where ""Casablanca"" fell far short of documenting the spirit (and fears) of the times on a granular level, Gymkata and its cast is unafraid to take this plunge.

In characterizations deeply respectful, and yet photo-accurate, regarding world cultures and global motifs, Gymkata manages spell the poly-sided views of complex conflicts that occurred during the final grey gasps of the Cold War.

Amazingly Gymkata manages a foreshadowing the rise of the Neo-Cons some 20 years later in its depictions of the United States use of aggression in strategically important hotspot regions -- and as well -- the film is able to show that the nationalistic concerns of the competing sovreignties (both ally & foe) remain unchanged despite which decade these events play themselves out in.

396949,4,6301969928,"When I was growing up, it seemed like every other movie on cable television was either called Iron Eagle or Gymkata.  I had no use for Iron Eagle.  Sorry.  Gymkata, however, was a altogether different story.  I must have seen this movie a few hundred times between grades 10-12--generally at three in the morning, stumbling in, stumbling out--less of a choice, more of a compromise.  As if the pay channels didn't milk the Gymkata cash cow dry, local stations decided to make it their duty to keep it in heavy rotation on a weekly basis.  The only movie that came close in its domination of b-string broadcasting was the 1972 classic, Gargoyles.  But I digress.  Gymkata is about a martial artist (Kurt Thomas) who loses his military papa (Eric Lawson).  He goes to a small fictional nation that encompasses every clich? relating to villains from the 1980's.  There's intrigue, a great feast, and more intrigue.  There's an exotic princess who, to this day, still looks pretty good.  The best part of the movie is the game of death--mostly because there isn't a great deal of dialog.  As other reviews have mentioned, the asylum/village has some classic moments (the cackling woman comes to mind).  Long story short, an olympic wannabe offers up a textbook example of why his acting career went nowhere.  Of course, who am I to judge?

However, this film is so bad it will probably become a cult favorite in the years to come. It makes Ed Wood Jr look like Steven Spielberg. Simply put, Gymkata has no equals when it comes to low-rate films. That's why it should be ported to DVD and every person who likes films SHOULD have a copy of this movie. But I feel the distributor should PAY the viewer to take a tape or disc of this film off their hands, instead of the other way around.
Gymkata will make you laugh more than most comedies. The action scenes are predictable, unrealistic, etc...And look for some good flubs, too. Although the characters are supposed to be native to some remote areas of Asia/Europe, the blond antagonist often reveals a strong New York City accent. Hysterical!
