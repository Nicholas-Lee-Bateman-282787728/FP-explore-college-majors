525513,5,6302969700,"There is no plot to this film, we just follow the adventures of Mr Hulot on a short holiday to a Breton seaside resort in the immediate post-war years. He is joined there, for what is best described as a fictional fly on  the wall doucmentary, by exactly the sort of disparate crowd that you would  expect to meet on such a holiday.
Almost bereft of dialogue and filmed in  black and white, we see Hulot involved in a series of adventures and  misadventures. In a way, the film is like an early fifties version of Mr  Bean but Hulot's reaction to every mishap is a Gallic shrug and a happy  disposition which always rubs off on those around him.
The humour is a  mixture of surreal, slapstick and irony and, despite the relaxed atmosphere  of the film, there is always something happenning. There is no moment  without some visual or audio gag somewhere. Despite this relentless stream,  there is great balance in the film. You never feel that there is too much  of something or that a certain point has been pushed too far. Great comedy  always needs that kind of restraint and flawless timing.
This is the  first and certainly the best of the Mr Hulot films. The later ones never  recaptured the same sense of innocent whimsy. This film stands out as one  of the funniest movies ever made.",961804800,9,1291,4.504310344827586

525635,2,6302969700,"I wish I could give this film two-and-a-half stars, because while it's less than ""okay"" in my opinion, I didn't really ""dislike"" it either. Mostly I was bored and annoyed and maybe a bit confused.

The film is a disjointed collection of sight gags, most of which are not funny, I realize that the plotnessness is part of the film's delivery, that the film is mimicking the mundane meandering of a conventional seaside vacation where nothing happens and nobody does anything. But it doesn't work as a film. At some point such a message defies the audience instead of inviting it. I'm not on vacation at the seaside. I'm in my living room waiting to hear a good story. This isn't one. It's a crashing bore.

With respect to the gags themselves, they wore thin on me quickly. When characters act stupidly or absurdly a few times over 90 minutes, it can be very funny. When they act stupidly every 30 seconds, it can still be funny 30 minutes later, or it can be annoying. The characters in this film are annoying. I haven't figured out yet why I find an idiot like Mr. Bean funny but I don't find Tati's idiot funny. I've been told that this is a film one must see more than once to like, but to me that is a sign of inferior or unfinished art.",1448064000,,1241,4.367965367965368

525670,5,6302969700,"Jacques Tati was a genius. He made few movies, each one a gem, but, in my opinion Mr. Hulot's Holiday was the very best. It has almost no dialogue, but you're never in doubt what is going on or what the characters are thinking - and it's laugh-aloud funny. I showed it to my baby-boomer son recently, a man difficult to impress. He was amazed at the artistry and humor. He now has an even better opinion of me, for owning it!

Mr. Hulot, along with the rest of French men and women, is taking the long-weekend holiday at the seashore in a small resort hotel. You get the impression that most of the guests return here year after year. Outings have been arranged, none for children worse luck, and most are ignored by the guests who seem to just take walks, play cards, sit on the beach. Cliques are formed, but Mr. Hulot doesn't belong to any of them. He sailes blithely from activity to group to event getting in everyone's way, creating chaos wherever he goes and unknowingly delighting some of the other outsiders who much appreciate his contribution to their vacation.

Tati must have devoted hours and hours making inanimate objects perform in just the perfect way for the perfect shot. In one episode his very beat-up little car has a flat while he's acting as chauffer to a planned outing. The tire rolls down the hill picking up brightly colored Fall leaves on the way. Then it rolls into a cemetery where it's picked up and displayed for a funeral. The other funeral guests think it's a floral tribute and line up to thank Hulot for his tribute to the deceased. It's all so unexpected and howlingly funny. Great stuff!",1425513600,3,1627,4.530612244897959

525704,5,6302969700,"A minor but very sweet little film featuring the well-meaning but bungling Mr. Hulot, as he travels to the French seashore for a vacation at a little coastal town right on the beach.  Jaque Tati has his own brand of physical comedy, which is very low-key.  Being an avid summer beach-goer myself, this cute portrayal of all the different types of vacationers from the city romping on the beach warmed my heart, and I enjoyed the silly situations in which he finds himself.  The very sparse dialogue and minimalist music score added to my enjoyment.  Perhaps not for everyone, but I absolutely loved it!",1419897600,,602,4.759615384615385

525710,5,6302969700,"This is a classic. In my opinion it is not slapstick, as some have said. A lot of the humor is more subtle, as in the opening when Mr. Hulot enters the hotel, the wind blows through the lobby area and one lady is pouring tea into a cup farther away. Also, the sound that the door makes as it swings back and forth when someone passes through it is genius. If you are looking for sitcom humor, this is not the movie for you. However, if you like subtle humor with some very funny moments...enjoy.

He is NOT Jackie Mason (Bless him!), not Henny Youngman (Bless him, too!).

Tati is perhaps most like the physical comedy cinema period stars whose comedy is
the character-- a more subtle Buster Keaton, perhaps.

My wife and I had seen it on TV but a week later it was playing at a theatre in Greenwich
Village -- where before we had smiled, we now guffawed out loud. The visual fun is better on
a LARGE screen!",1395187200,,483,4.355555555555555
525774,5,6302969700,"There are two types of comedies in cinema today: those that rely on fart jokes, pop-culture references and dated memes; the other on rapid-fire dialogue that's all rapid but no fire. So how much of a relief it is to re-watch this charming, entertaining comedy by the greatest of all French clowns. At a time when comedians begged to be funny, seeing Tati's observant movies is like a breath of fresh air.

Tati's ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" follows a simple logline: Monsieur Hulot and a group of tourists attempt to have a relaxing vacation on a sunny beach. Now you're thinking, ""That's too threadbare. Where's the detail?"". But under Tati's direction, the movie becomes something more. It is both a satire of bourgeois society and a mockery of human labor over simple pleasures. Capitalists, Marxist intellectuals, suburban folk and business owners get swept under the rug. Joy, fun, simple pleasures and innocence are celebrated. The movie is both simple and complex, a hard balance to achieve. Yet it leaves your smiling from beginning to end; even those that don't get the political subtext will enjoy themselves.

I should mention that ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" isn't like the rambunctious comedies of today or even the screwball comedies of the 30s-50s. For one thing, the movie is predominately silent, with the exception of a few sound effects. Second, ""Holiday"" moves in a deliberate pace, which will leave viewers accustomed to faster-paced comedies impatient. And third, most of the visual gags, which are very funny, aren't discovered until the second or even third viewing. I remember watching ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" the first time and I thought it was a very good comedy. But when I saw it the second time, I noticed some of the intriguing visual jokes that I didn't see in the first viewing. Tati's movies are like a cross between Charlie Chaplin and Yasujiro Ozu, combining the former's gentle humor with Ozu's subtle but meticulous detail and observant approach. I'll go far as saying that some viewers may not like it the first time (although I hardly met anyone who didn't like it), but if you give it a second chance, you may discover something new.

I could go into detail on how great ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" (and Tati's subsequent movies) is and pinpoint some of my favorite sequences, but doing so would deprive moviegoers the pleasure in seeing the film. You have to see the movie for yourself. All I can to tell you is that if you watch this movie, you'll never look at a tennis court, a firework hut, a hotel or a beach shore the same way again. It's also got one of the most infectious theme songs in movie history: a breezing jazz tune with a lovely saxophone and subtle piano chords. Once you listen to it, you'll never get it out of your head.

Unfortunately, four of Tati's movies (including ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"") went out of print last year by Criterion and thus not available by anyone, except for third-party sellers for an astronomical price (although there's a rumor that they may return in a Blu-Ray box set later this year). But if you happen to come across ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" on Criterion, do not hesitate to buy it. All of Tati's movies, even his weaker ones (""Trafic""), are excellent, but ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" is essential to all movie lovers. Not only is it the perfect introduction to the director; it's one of the best movies ever made.

I'm afraid I only laughed during one gag and I've seen it before done by one of the previously mentioned masters. I may not always laugh (or cry) with Charlie or Buster, but at least I feel they tickle or tug at my heart. With Hulot, I remained open, consciously struggling not to judge the experience too strongly. I hoped the film would grow on me as it progressed but I didn't get it. Perhaps it's my loss.

525872,5,6302969700,"I loved this film.  Being a fan of many foreign and silent films, I was able to appreciate the subtlety of this very soft spoken film.

The film centers around a vacation to the beach (La Plage) by Mr. Hulot and others.  Some light comedy ensues, but I would never call it slapstick.  And I don't feel the comparisons to Mr. Bean are fair.  Instead Hulot has a kind of clumsy, idiot savant personality.  He definitely has boundary issues.  At times he picks up a book someone was reading and removes the bookmark to look at it then sets it back down with the bookmark removed.  Not what I would call slapstick, but it is genuinely funny.

One of the delights in this film is the lack of dialogue.  When you do hear dialogue it is presented as if you the viewer were a casual observer in the room.  Conversations are realistic with people talking all at once and heard muted, as if you were listening from a nearby table.  It works well for the style.  It's a film about people watching performed and directed very well in this style.  Another note: I don't think there was a single shot that lasted longer than 30 seconds.  The film cuts often, in a wonderful montage style.  I think most shots were around 5-10 seconds with a few of the longer 20-30 second shots being a short comedic bit (such as Hulot reaching across the table for the salt).  And my favorite scenes were the tennis match and the funeral.  Hilarious in a not so obvious way!

This version is based on a 1970s restored reel, so there is quite a bit missing.  Most of the cuts though were not terribly important, and often the film was  shown, even in France, in a reduced version (90 minutes instead of 110).  Most foreign releases were based on the shorter reels also.  So in essence, the full 110 minute version is more of a 'Director's Cut' I would say.

There are a couple of extras on this disc, including Rene Clement's 1963 short film, Soigne ton gauche, starring Jacques Tati and an introduction to the film.  The extras are rather sparse, but this is not one of the mega re-releases that Criterion sometimes puts out, but rather an improved digital version of a classic with the extras just added on as a bonus.  I would enjoy some extras on a later release, perhaps some commentary and a nice 20+ page booklet with writings about the film (Criterion films often include these).  Since I am able to get this version from my local library I don't see much point in owning the standard Criterion release.  If you can rent it, check it out from a library, or hit up Netflix for the Criterion version, I recommend it.  If you love the film it is worth owning, but I would hope that a more complete version with the additional scenes and more extras be released in the future.

But overall an A+ film with some great acting, light comedy, wonderful editing, and masterful directing.",1334966400,,2855,4.455598455598456

Like many other period comedies, M. Hulot's Holiday is an understated emotional adventure. I quite enjoyed it. It wasn't a life changer, but the effect is rather pleasant.

You should be prepared for the dated quality of film, the ""Mr. Bean-esque"" non-dialogue (en francais plutot), and the general lack of plot...

It's just fun to watch. You'll need to be able to really watch the screen to understand the film. If you have significant visual impairment, the action will likely escape you.

M. Hulot is saddled with a rather adolescent sense of humor, to which he more often appears the victim. He is beyond awkward, though his dexterity is average. He is a toe walker, extremely polite and seemingly unaware of his social ineptitude.

He was both acting and directing. A really underrated and mostly unknown talent.
About this movie:

Mr Hulot goes to the beach side of France, very likely in the area of Deauville and spend a few days vacating there and trouble this small resort with his original antics.
The movie has very little dialogs, most of them in English because of the British tourists. Every scene looks like a postcard of the 50's. My copy of the movie is in Black and White and yet the scenery is really pretty.

525899,4,6302969700,"Les vacances de M. Hulot ( aka M. Hulot's Holiday) follows the generally harmless misadventures of a lovable, gauche Frenchman, Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself), as he joins the 'newly-emerging holiday-taking classes' for an August vacation at a modest seaside resort in Breton. The film is a series of comic misadventures with hardly a word of dialogue that works terrifically.

 The film affectionately lampoons several hidebound elements of French political and economic classes, from chubby capitalists and self-important Marxist intellectuals to petty proprietors and drab dilettantes, most of whom find it nearly impossible to free themselves, even temporarily, from their rigid social roles in order to relax and enjoy life. The film also gently mocks the confidence of postwar western society in the primacy of work over leisure and the value of complex technology over simple pleasures, themes that would resurface in his later films.

The thing that most impresses about Les Vacances as was also the case in Jour le Fete is the innocence of the entire thing. The rememberance of a time past that will never be again. There is no real plot in this film. Tourists go on vacation and things simply happen to them. Hulot is not so much accident prone as accidents continually seem to happen around him. Tati wears the character of Hulot well. It can be said that Tati was a silent comedian working in the world of sound films and this description is apt. The film is a series of wonderfully executed sight gags and slapstick comedy that never grows old.

Tati's film grammar is such that he leaves his camera in one place locked down and fills the entire frame with action. There are no real closeups the viewer gets the feeling that he is an observer of all the wonder that is going on around him. Hulot is just a frame on which to hang the action. Perhaps we need more comedies of this type. Films that we can laugh at for the sake of laughing. Maybe then we could have a better simpler world.

I screened the BFI edition of the film. The picture was quite good and what subtitles there were worked fine. In this kind of film subtitles are not really necessary toenjoy the experience. Voices appear in Tati movies not to advance the storyline but more to fill the soundtrack the way any other sound effect would. The only extra was an excellent interview with director Richard Lester on Tati's influence on him and the world of comedy in general. Lester compares Tati to both Chaplin and Keaton and the comparison works quite well.

This is a film that needs to be seen by any real student of filmed comedy. Buy it.",1300233600,,2630,4.743982494529541
525900,5,6302969700,"M. Hulot's Holiday is a classic completely deserving of the term.  Other Amazon reviewers who have given it five stars have done a superb job of describing its many excellent attributes.  I would like to strongly echo the point that it would require multiple viewings, at least on my part, to follow and understand the various gags, images, and characters.  Some of the routines are subtle or require knowledge of French culture; others are straight-forward slapstick, such as the young men who run into each other while distracted by the beautiful girl.  I found the variety to be both rich, engaging, and enthralling.  Film viewing may be passive compared to reading, but watching a work of such creative artistry is at least the least passive form of cinema viewing.  One must focus on and engage with such material to follow it.

Hulot's Holiday offers an informative portrait of French society in its depiction of an assortment of mostly French vacationers at the beach.  But I was even more interested in how the film presents human qualities common to people everywhere--the longing for friendship and community, the uncomfortable place of the misfit or individualist, the traditions and interests that draw people together.  In this regard the ending was very striking.  As the various vacationers take leave of each other at the end of their time at the beach, it appears that most have grown closer to one another and are saying their farewells with sincere regret.  Initially no one takes notice of the eccentric M. Hulot, who had trouble fitting in in the first place and had further damaged relationships with his inadvertent setting off of a huge store of fireworks.  Hulot is pathetically trying to find someone to shake hands with and all are avoiding him.  But just when it seems as if no one has any regard for him, several characters--the elderly British lady, the old gentleman tied to his wife, and the children, fondly wish him well.  The film ends on this, to me, optimistic note, that within the diverse and sometimes aloof human community, there are individuals out there who will appreciate Jacques Tati's Hulot, and any other character for that matter.  God made people to exist in relationship with each other, not to drift into lonely isolation and proud independence.  And while that may be harder or easier depending on one's background and personality, there is friendship and true understanding out there for every type, as long as one retains at least some capacity for the giving of one's self.  Hulot, who was an unintentional menace at times, played table tennis with the children, offered rides in his ridiculous car and preserved the genteel manners of a by-gone age.  His gestures did not go completely unnoticed.

The Criterion print is outstanding.  This film is certainly worth owning for those who enjoy watching such a film multiple times.",1298505600,,2884,4.956340956340957
525901,5,6302969700,"Before Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson), there was Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot, a carefree, weirdly graceful but nevertheless maladroit twit who unknowingly leaves pandemonium in his wake.  This 1953 comedy introduced the Hulot character and is a beautiful digital transfer with nicely restored black and white image and sound.  The thin plot is really only a series of set pieces and sight gags at a quaint seaside vacation spot.  Don't miss this balmy satire of people working hard to enjoy themselves.

Tati writes, directs and performs with great precision. Perfect lighting, artful composition, minimal dialogue and sly use of sounds with repetitive music coming from within the scenes themselves add greatly to this carefully choreographed classic of gentle slapstick.  By any standards, this ranks among the comedic gems of world cinema.  Some cinema scholars suggest the original French cut may have been almost 30 minutes longer, but this version is perfect.  Woody Allen said comedies don't work well past 88 minutes.  From Criterion.  (1953, Not Rated, Full Frame, French with optional English subtitles, 87 Minutes.)",1283731200,,1123,5.408045977011494

525903,5,6302969700,"Younger audiences don't appreciate Tati's efforts.  They aren't old enough to remember the days when living was simple.  Crouded Buses, Trains, rattling backfiring cars were common and tolerated. They can't picture being in those circumstances and can't look back and laugh at themselves.

We old folks laugh at the people running in a panic between railroad platforms, but we can't figure out why that's funny, ""everybody did that to get a seat"".

An old dog sleeping in the middle of the road moving for a loud speeding honking car, then back in the road again and only wagging his tail when Hulot squeezes his little bulb horn.  But finally getting up and going over to the driver and getting a pat-pat then on into the store.  Little old time human behavior is Tati's receipt for humor.

Older folks can identify with every character in the movie as someone they have known in their lifetime even themselves.  Those old boarding house hotels at the beach, with everyone coming in to eat at the ring of the bell don't exist any more, only giant edifices with pools and servants.  Nothing is simple any more.  Tati banks on this.

At times Tati exaggerates human failings just to draw attention to them for humor, but that is forgiven.

There are some problems with the film however. One is that Criterion does not subtitle all of the dialogue. This can be frustrating sometimes when we feel like we've missed some of the background action. Also, due to the culture gap that comes from a separation of 50 years and the Atlantic Ocean, some of the jokes don't quite hit home. I was left scratching my head after a few scenes. I knew there was a joke, but couldn't figure out what it was. However, if you enjoy comedy along the lines of the Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin, The Three Stooges, etc., then you'll enjoy this little gem.

One almost regrets, in this age of internet browsing, email connections and lightning-fast communications that the very archaic conditions that create the absurd scenes--witness the station fiasco--have actually gone away.

Do I need to offer a plot summary here? For the two or three of you who may have never heard of M. Hulot, all I should have to say is this: he was the inspiration for the modern character Mr. Bean. You should now have a basic outline of M. Hulot's Holiday, the film in which director Jacques Tati introduced his much-beloved, long-running character to movie fans. The travails Tati ran into making the film are legendary, and I wonder off and on how much of that plays into so many critics calling it one of the thousand, and even the hundred, best movies ever made. I have to say, I don't buy it's just for the movie alone, which is nothing more than a series of sight gags strung together in what is less a plot than it is a slice-of-life kind of movie. And given the enduring popularity of the Three Stooges and other such things, I can see where that sort of thing would still be popular enough that the Brits could re-tool Hulot and come up with Bean.

The fact that it repeated the same music over and over added to the charm and hilarity. Yes, it was irritating at times, but I think that was the purpose of it. It is a ""madhouse"" of a movie.

There are simply too many fabricated events: people almost getting hit by cars, spilling things, bumping into each other, etc. People getting scared by the ""shark"" was just silly.  How could anyone think that looked like a shark?

There were a few convincing slapstick moments that made me laugh.

I found that at 83mins it dragged a bit and whilst the jazzy music theme was great the first time I heard it, after the theme had been repeated about a dozen times it began to get on my nerves. Tati himself was undoubtably a talented visual comedian, and if he had been working 30 years earlier, before the introduction of sound would probably have been a bigger star. If I had seen this film when I was very young I'm sure that it would have made a lasting impression on me (like Laurel & Hardy) and I would have rated it much higher.

526005,5,6302969700,"This comedy marks the debut of Jacques Tati in his most famous role as Monsieur Hulot, and what an entry it is for a character! We are not introduced to him in any formal way and yet after a few minutes we seem to recognize him -- the clumsy outsider who, despite his best efforts, never really fits in -- because we have probably all met somebody like him.

What may be most strange to modern audiences might be the mode of vacation in itself -- this film harkens from a time when being on holiday was as much a social occasion as a time to relax. Compare this to the modern idea of vacations as an endless thrill ride that leaves people more exhausted than they were in the first place.

In ""Hulot"", the main things to do are eating (with comical punctuality), walking around the seaside, and lying on the beach. Into this quiet stumbles Hulot and has, with his antics, by the end upset it somewhat. His punishment? Being shunned by most of the adults in the end who prefer to pretend that things they cannot assimilate (like Hulot) do not exist. Only the kids and the elderly man -- who is always walking a few paces behind his wife and is therefore free to witness Hulot's doings and be amused by them, as we are -- seem to understand.

The Criterion transfer isn't bad, but they are trying too hard to give the film (like all their black-and-white titles) a very contrasty look, with deep blacks that sometimes look a bit jarring. That approach may work for a film noir or something that was lit with a high contrast to begin with, but for this summer fare, I feel a lower-contrast look would have been more appropriate.

I guess those deep glossy-magazine blacks are something people associate with ""quality"" and ""brilliance"" in DVD transfers, so apparently one cannot do without them. But I bet this was not how the film looked like in the theater.

So what does the film say, basically? Maybe that you will have the best time (not just on vacation but generally) if you are able to adjust to society and its boring rituals to some degree but also, from time to time, let a little Hulot-like zaniness into your life and recognize the absurdity of it all. And that seems to be pretty good advice to me.",1185235200,2,2208,4.428571428571429
526006,5,6302969700,"After watching ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" it becomes clear that it's unfair to mention the names of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton without mentioning Jacques Tati, the star, co-writer, and director of ""M. Hulot's Holiday."" While the majority of Chaplin and Keaton's work was created in the silent era and ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" was released 26 years into the sound era; it largely remains a silent comedy. A beautiful, gentle film that is slapstick at its very best. While there is sound on the soundtrack and many characters speak, Monsieur Hulot does not. He's a simple man that only mumbles and manages to unknowingly wreak havoc on the various visitors during a holiday at a resort. He's not retarded though, although it sure seems like it at times. He's very polite and bows whenever he sees a woman. The movie is, obviously, low on plot and is merely 86 minutes of circumstances for Hulot to do something stupid. Unlike Keaton and Chaplin however, Tati also gives the guests of the resort some notice too. In fact, many of the guests provide more laughs than Tati. There are some great scenes in this film. When Hulot is in his boat and it suddenly snaps in half, with the fabric inside tearing to give it the appearance of a shark. There's the scene where Hulot arrives in the goofiest looking car you will ever see and interrupts a dog that is trying to sleep in the road. One of the things that makes the film work so well is the score. It's an upbeat jazz number that plays through almost the whole movie and works so well for it. It's music that even feels happy, music that kind of personifies the way someone would feel if they were on vacation. ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" is not a hilarious film, fall down funny in it's humor. But it's not supposed to be either. This is not a flaw, though. If this were merely a film with hilarious jokes, you could only watch it a few times until the jokes weren't funny anymore and you grew sick of it. Since ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" is a comedy based on its charm and it's nostalgic feel, it is a film that one can watch over and over again. A true masterpiece.

526007,5,6302969700,"This is the funniest film I know. It is sly, witty, wistful, gentle and almost entirely free from dialogue!  And it is as good-natured as a 1950s summer holiday at the sea side in France could be. The characters are caricatures, indeed they are, but the situations and the brilliant comic timing of that genius, Jacques Tati, take this film far far beyond heavy-handed slapstick farce. My father's judgement was that having characters shout and shriek at each other, do crass double takes and fall down does not amount to comedy (test this criterion against almost any modern American ""humor""). In M.Hulot's Holiday, the characters do all their acting with the subtle or not-so-subtle expressions of their faces, a raised eyebrow, a Gallic shrug.

Are people often funny? Yes. You only have to observe them, best of all when they are trying to relax at the beach, to see that. Well-observed children, waiters, tycoons, old couples, youths...all stumble around the incomparable Jacques Tati. And, if you ever needed convincing that black-and-white photography is best for portraiture, this film will do that. Are there films which really are ""must see"". Yes.

As a note, there is much more to Hulot's clumsiness than meets the eye.  Under that bumbling lies the heart of a romantic and a rather suave gentleman.  The gist of this film basically centers on Hulot's holiday, at sea, complete with catchy, low-key incidental music (I doubt you will get the song out of your head), plenty of misunderstandings and mishaps that really don't need translation.  That's perfect because the dialogue in this film is minimal.  Basically, it feels like the director just stepped back and let Mr. Hulot take over on the film.  It's very entertaining.

The movie is deliberately paced, with little dialog and full of gentle humor. In fact, the film's innocence would be very hard to recreate today (the movie looks irresistibly nostalgic now, as it evokes a certain time and period that no longer exists). You might think that this is not a recipe for an uproariously funny comedy, but despite that, you just can't stop laughing at Tati's very elaborate set pieces. It's a huge improvement over Tati's previous film, Jour de Fete, a movie I found to be hugely overrated.

The movie has little dialogue but plenty of visual humor.  Mr. Hulot is certainly an odd duck but he creates a great deal of mischief in his wake.  The holiday spot is a lone resort by the beach so the cast is constant through the movie.  We get to know their pecadillos which helps the humor along.  There's a Chaplinesque scene where Hulot is painting lacquer (I suppose) on part of his small rowboat.  I felt that the scene best shows the care and calculation that Director Tati will take to make a scene work.  All in all, this movie is a winner.  There are no slow spots in the movie and the humor starts right from the beginning and lasts to the end.  No one can help but enjoy this movie.

Like Mr. Magoo he wreaks havoc all around him though he remains oblivious to it all. There is very little dialogue, but lots of background noises; all the gags are sight gags. Some are wonderful: the boat that folds in half making it look like a shark and adjusting the pictures on the wall in the living room with a riding crop.

I'm thinking that the ""helpful"" votes associated with these reviews are not really all that helpful.  They might as well call them ""agree/disagree"" votes.  That's what they actually are. Fans of this film will vote ""NO"" to a negative review and ""YES"" to a positive review.

 For example, look at Valarie's review from February 9, 2001. Valarie didn't care much for this film.  I believe she gave it a 1 star rating.  She gave some good reasons too.  The Hulot fans piled all over her with ""not helpful"" votes.  Well Valarie, I agree with you.  This film can be very boring.  The film itself admits that there is no plot.  The film consists of a series of sight gags that may provide a few chuckles, but they are not laugh-out-loud hilarious.  It is difficult for a modern day American viewer to relate to groups of people chasing a train around to get to the beach.  Maybe my grandpa would have howled, but I personally have never taken a train to the beach.  I can barely relate to most of the things M. Hulot does in this film.  It is a museum piece.  I agree that there is some interest in that.  The film certainly has great charm.  But it is not the laugh-fest that many of the reviewers would have you believe.  If you are looking for a good laugh this is not the place to get it.  Go right to Mr. Bean who has carried this kind of art to a modern day audience.  (I don't mean the Bean movies--- watch the television series. I believe you can buy the entire Bean Television series on DVD for not much more than the price of this single Hulot film.)

  As Valarie said in 2001, this film will put the average young person to sleep quickly.  In fact I've tested it.  It takes about 20-25 minutes for a typical teenager to completely tune out. I personally like to encourage young people to watch ""old black and white movies."" There are so many that will stimulate their interest. M. Hulot's Holiday probably deserves a spot well down the film studies path, but it is certainly not anywhere near the starting point.

I first saw this movie soon after it first appeared in theaters and thought, at that time, it would be a monumental classic. Since then, the projector in my mind has replayed so many scenes so often that in the replaying it's grown even more hilarious. From time to time, I see it again and each time realize that -- as funny as the original is -- that it has that rare quality of planting seeds which grow and blossom in my memory even more.

There is very little plot beyond 'what I did on my summer vacation' -- but there doesn't need to be.

I've also seen Jacque Tati's ""Mon Oncle"" several times; while it's good, to me it's several magnitudes lower than 'holiday.' I'd looked forward to seeing ""Playtime"" with the sure knowledge that nothing can top ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" and I was right. As with all humor, people have tastes for different flavors.

526103,5,6302969700,"According to the 1990 US Census, Hulett is the #5444th most common surname in America.  Hulot is a French spelling of this European surname.  You can understand my appreciation for the title.  The name just doesn't come up that often.

Fortunately this charming bit of humor hits me right where I live too.  The comparison is easy to make between Tati's style to those of classic clowns like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, Red Skelton, and Rowan Atkinson's ""Mr. Bean.""

In this famous film, which was nominated for two Oscars and won top prize at Cannes, M. Hulot arrives at a beach resort populated with a wide variety of characters, including a retired military man, a couple of innocent and charming toddlers, a middle-aged couple who are forever strolling, and a tremendously gorgeous blonde lady with Princess Leia hair.  The entire plot involves M. Hulot's attempts to take part in the various activities provided here for his vacation.

Marvelous sight gags include a diner unwittingly wiping his mouth on M. Hulot's sleeve, a photographer mistakenly taken for a peeping Tom, a bucket of paint that seems to miraculously have a mind of its own, a deflating wreath of flowers at a funeral, M. Hulot managing to unknowingly ruin two card games while hunting for his ping pong ball, and many, many, many other moments that run the gamut from sweetness to outright hilarity.  My favorite sound gag is the door to the dining room, which seems somewhat akin to a tennis ball being bounced on a bongo drum.  (Yes, I guess you had to be there.....so see the film!)

This DVD allows one the option of watching an English version, which I recommend.  Although there is very little dialogue, with the humor mainly being visual and sound effects, the subtitles are intrusive, and unless you are familiar with the French language it's just more comfortable to hear the few lines of dialogue being spoken in English, which makes for a less jarring experience for us single-language cretins.

Overall the experience is only slightly dated, considering that this film is about 50 years old as I type this, and it's not something a restless young person could much appreciate.  Unlike much of what the movie world has turned out over the past couple of decades, this bears repeated watching, as there's so much you'll miss the first time, so a DVD is a good investment here.  You'll want to spend your time viewing, also, as obviously you won't get much from just listening if you have to leave the screen for a moment.

526104,5,6302969700,"When I first saw ""Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot"" many years ago, I couldn't understand what was the big deal.  The film had its amusing moments - Hulot's Amilcar bouncing down the road and that tennis game! - but it seemed too slight for all the adjectives that critics had bestowed upon it.
After getting the DVD two years ago (before it was temporarily discontinued), I watched it again and saw an entirely different movie.  The slightness that had bored me when I was teenager had changed into a feeling of wistfulness - the sense that we're watching a transient, quickly passing moment in people's lives.  Tati's comedy, much more gentle than most American comedies, reveals itself only in multiple viewings.  The film is more like a comic meditation on memory: how our all-too-brief periods of leisure open up and close possbilities for friendship, love, and other human interactions.  This is a film to revisit again and again.",1086220800,11,934,4.886075949367089
526105,5,6302969700,"It is now 50 years since this marvellous comedy was released, and it remains as fresh and original as ever. With so many other comments, I should not need to tell readers that Tati is a comic genius, and a keen observer of the human condition. Time marches on, but--in many ways--people, whether they are children, adults, even senior citizens, do not change.
This film has many great sequences--even if you have seen it before, and know what is about to happen, you cannot help but smile and laugh at M. Hulot and his fellow vacationers.
Tati was one of the most inventive minds in the history of comedic film--your collection is the poorer without this masterpiece !",1075075200,,668,4.669491525423729
526106,4,6302969700,"TK RILEY states in his (her?) review that ""All [M. Hulot's Holiday, Mon Oncle, Playtime] were in Full Screen format (only version available) and so some of the humor was not on screen that I recalled from the Wide screen versions I had seen in theaters.""
This is simply not true. Criterion *always* presents the film in one of two ways:
1) The director's preferred aspect ratio
2) The original theatrical ratio
In the case of these three films all have been presented in their *original* theatrical ratios. In the cases of 'M. Hulot's Hoiliday' and 'Mon Oncle' the ratio is 1.33:1 (same as a standard TV) while 'Playtime' is (and was) presented in 1.85:1 ratio. Why are the first two the same size as a standard TV? A lot of people don't realise that the television borrowed it's ratio (4:3 or 1.33:1) from movie theater screens. Prior to the mid-to-late 1950's films were not presented in the wide rectangle we now see at the cineplex.",1074729600,3,936,4.644578313253012

526108,5,6302969700,"Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot has been compared to Mr. Bean and Charlie Chaplin and that's not a bad comparision. Tati has said that he patterned Mr. Hulot after Buster Keaton and that's closer, but he has put his own spin on the character Mr. Hulot.
Mr. Hulot's Holiday is a good place to start admiring Jacques Tati's Mr. Hulot films but they are all great, all full of sight gags and observations on human nature. Mr. Hulot wanders and blunders through his holiday like a big kid observing, but not even trying to understand the odd behavior of the adults around him. The sight gags are fabulous, often leaving Mr. Hulot wondering how did this get from here to there or how did that happen. If you blink you will have to watch the film again to catch what you have missed. There is very little dialog - Jacques Tati was an aficinado of silent films - so if you do not like watching a subtitled film don't be put off. And don't be put off by the statement: ""non-American"" humor, this is funny stuff. Jacques Tati is one of the great comics.
All the Mr. Holot films are equally brilliant; they will leave you smiling, laughing, and ocassionally - as when Mr. Hulot is trying to put out a fire in a shed full of fireworks - gasping for air.",1053561600,3,1240,4.372294372294372
526109,5,6302969700,"Mr. Hulot is a funny guy. He has this run down car that has a horn that makes meowing noises that he takes to a hotel by the beach for a vacation. While he's there, he does a lot of funny things. One part I liked was when he was kayaking and the kayak broke in half and then he was sandwiched between the two parts. He kept on lifting up the top and closing it, making himself look like a sea monster and everyone on the beach was scared and they ran away. He is a guy who doesn't behave like the others who are staying at the hotel. They are busy talking about the news and playing cards while he's listening to music.  One time he helped this boy carry his things up a hill. Everyone congratulated him for making it to the top and then they offered him a drink. He took the cup and arched his back and he fell down the hill. If you like comedy, you'll definitely like this one.",1052352000,,879,3.9943181818181817
526140,5,6302969700,"What can be said about Jacques Tati that hasn't already been said? The man was a comic genius, and demonstrates that talent superbly in this, my favourite Tati film of all time. The viewer doesn't have to speak French to witness the humour in all it's glory. So many comedic actors from around the world today owe so much to Jacques Tati. Benny Hill, Jack Benny, John Cleese, Paul Whitehouse and Peter Kay all owe so much to this man... Whether they admit it or not! Enjoy Jacques Tati at his best in this movie never to be forgotten once seen!",1032480000,,544,4.396039603960396
526141,5,6302969700,"French director Jacques Tati had an amazing ability to tell stories through a little dialogue and a lot of ambient sound with a bit of physical comedy added to taste.  Mr. Hulot's Holiday is a wonderful film to sit and watch, although you want to be sure you can devote full attention, because some of the sight or sound gags are ""blink and you missed it"" fast.  This is the first in a series of films featuring Mr. Hulot, continuing with MON ONCLE (My Uncle) and then PLAYTIME (my personal favorite--shot in breathtaking 70mm color!!).  There is another film called TRAFFIC (unrelated to the recent Steven Soderbergh film), but I haven't ever come across it.  Lovingly restored and issued by Criterion Collection, these DVDs are a must have for any collection.  Criterion recently lost its licence to continue the three Tati titles, so you better click to order now!",1029715200,2,867,4.791946308724833
526142,2,6302969700,"I saw Mr Hulot's Holiday at its first U.S. showing on televsion, probably in 1953, and became a lifelong fan. I recently bought both ""Holiday"" and what I always connsidered Tati's finest, ""Playtime."" While I enjoy the two films, they are both an almost unbearable disappointent in the Americanized versions.
Jacques must have been given bad advice about us to diminish his masterpieces with the addition of slapstick. I wish I knew how to get the originals.",1017273600,9,457,4.9480519480519485

I bought the US video version as a Christmas (2001) present to give to friends who also saw it on its first release and was very surprised when they said they were very disappointed with the video. I understood why when I, too, saw the US video version with US-English sub-titles that were superfluous and completely wrecked the concept  of a film that depended entirely on sound effects rather than dialogue for comedy. I had thought of buying 'Mon Oncle' as well but, having seen what was done to Ms Hulot, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on another disappoinment.",1015718400,5,645,4.551724137931035
526144,5,6302969700,A gentle and funny look back at a seaside resort in the 1950's. Tati shows his exquisite timing and subtle observation. This film was given to me as a birthday present. (DAD)It  was very good and extremely witty.,1002585600,3,212,4.578947368421052
526145,5,6302969700,"My husband and I enjoyed MR HULOT'S VACATION very much.  Although the film has been described elsewhere as slapstick, I don't think it is -- though there are a few scenes that made me laugh like crazy. VACATION is an intelligent and subltle film that does not depend on clever dialogue, in fact there is very little dialogue, though the film is not silent.
The comparison with Mr. Bean is a good one, but Tati is not Roland Atkins any more than Buster Keaton was Charlie Chaplin. In fact, Tati falls somewhere in between Chaplin and Atkins, neither as clumsy or pitiable as the former nor as socially inept as the latter. In fact, Mr. Hulot seems an average sort of guy who experiences more than his share of the odd experiences that can and do happen to everyone.
Mr. Hulot appeals because we can identify with him. For example, Mr. Hulot has problems with his car. Well, I once owned a car I could not get out of second gear. Since the mechanic could not fix it for a price I could afford, I drove it very slowly. My mother owned a car that flicked on the windshield wipers and headlights every time she hit a bump. She had to hit another bump to turn them off. My husband had an old MG with a rusted floorboard. As you rode along you could see the pavement underneath the car. We gave it to my daughter and she traded it for a bicycle.  Mr. Hulot's experiences with his car don't seem odd to me, and they make me laugh in recognition.
Chaplin was always center stage and to a certain extent Atkins is seldom out of the frame either. However, Mr Hulot shares the stage with an assortment of people some might call eccentric. In fact, the folks in VACATION remind me of the people who populate my own world. I am not unique, however, I am observant, and one of the things I like about Tati is that he recognizes each person is an individual and that each has interesting experiences that are occasionally funny. As Mr. Bennet says in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, ""but for what do we exist except to amuse others and they in their turn to amuse us.""  Humor is in the eye of the beholder.  Tati simply makes it obvious that people are funny.
Like Mr. Bean, Mr. Hulot blithely moves about unconscious of the havoc he leaves in his wake, but all of us cause havoc somewhere at some point and are unaware of it. Sometimes it's serious havoc. Have you never seen near accidents on the highway where the ""cause"" goes merrily on his way? Of course some accidents are bad, but often accidents are funny.
Unlike Mr. Bean, Mr. Hulot does not seem to be lonely.  He actually has a nice time with the beautiful blonde--well he mostly does, but if he fails to connect on an occasion or two it's not for lack of interest on her part.  And, Mr. Hulot is quite a good tennis player who makes a friend of the tennis coach (and impresses the blonde).
Probably the thing I enjoyed the most about this film was the context. What is it about vacations that brings out insanity?? The opening scenes as everyone heads to the beach are hilarious. I too have nearly missed trains in Europe from being on the wrong side of the track. However, there are some wonderful tranquill scenes too. The sound of the waves pounding the surf at night under a full moon, and the clear sunny sky by day, as well as the happy mood of the vactioners--especially the children--is enough to put anyone in a good mood. I love this little film and I'm going to watch it over and over. I'll buy more Tati DVDs too, since I don't have a car payment to worry about.",990489600,75,3509,4.341463414634147
526146,5,6302969700,"The other reviews here accurately relate the special comic qualities of this film. Subtle, perceptive and often laugh out loud. But be also aware that this film captures the innocence and promise of a postwar France that is gone forever. And, Mr. Tati's sensitivity to the frailties of the human condition is captured affectionately. More than a comedy, it is a lesson in life to share with the entire family. After all, he seems to be saying, ""...no one gets out of this alive. Let's be bemused!""",988070400,6,497,4.724137931034483
526147,5,6302969700,"This is one of the most beloved movies by affictionados of the foreign film scene. Tati provided a brilliant link between the best of what the silent movie era and modern film had to offer.  It is a relatively simple tale of a bumbling man on vacation on the coast of France. But repeated viewings, especially over the years, opens up more and more treasures that were heretofore unrecognized, like a classic novel. I would be surprised if anyone would rave about this film the first time they watch it. I certainly didn't. But repeat viewings over the years will give you an appreciation of this film that borders on worship. Every member of my extended family loves this movie, and everyone has there own particular reason. Some love it for its ability to perfectly capture a foreign time and place, allowing one to feel as if they themselves have escaped to the French coast for the afternoon. Some love Hulot's awkward but endearing attempts at romance the best. Many love the brilliant sight gags that are laugh-out-loud funny no matter how many times you've seen them. But regardless of what a viewer loves the most, everyone will feel a bond with Hulot's character (and, in turn, M. Tati) that will last a lifetime. With this DVD, I can finally feel safe to loan away my beloved, grainy VHS copy. A movie classic by every meaning of the term.",984441600,25,1349,4.644351464435147
