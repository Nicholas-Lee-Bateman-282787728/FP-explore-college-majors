8598687,3,B00DWBNTMK,"Good yoga dvd for first thru part of second trimester as basic stretching workout. Once belly starts to stick out some poses are uncomfortable. During end of pregnancy when you don't want to do inversions, I find myself standing around or trying to make up a different pose to do as a lot of the poses turn you upside down. One thing that really bothers me is the length of time spent on each side of a pose is not equal. Like, 1 minute on right side while she talks and then switch to left side for 15 seconds. At the end, the final pose is 3 minutes on right side and less then 1 minute on the other side. After I did dvd a few times I went at my own pace doing poses for equal times on both sides of body. In my third trimester I am now looking for another prenatal yoga dvd that is specifically for third trimester mamas.",1412553600,,825,4.067484662576687
8598688,4,B00DWBNTMK,"I'm very fit (or was, pre-pregnancy), so I didn't even pull this out until my 9th month because I thought it wouldn't be a workout.  Is certainly not going to make you sweat bullets, but late in pregnancy it can still be a workout.  I wish I'd started with these around the 6month mark... Feels really good to stretch out",1393459200,,321,4.333333333333333
8598689,5,B00DWBNTMK,"I have practiced yoga for quite some time now and was looking for a prenatal DVD that would still challenge me, but in a safe way.  This DVD does it! I really like the movement, there is great flow, and the instructor prompts you throughout the practice to reconnect with yourself and your baby as you go through the movements. I really like that.  My only complaint is that there is only one routine on this DVD, so if you plan to practice at home full time during pregnancy, I would recommend getting another DVD as well for some variety throughout the week.  Enjoy!",1378944000,3,568,4.4423076923076925
8598690,5,B00DWBNTMK,I really enjoyed this prenatal yoga video. It was not only a good exercise but it was also very helpful regarding mindfulness and very relaxing. The yoga instructor is very knowledgeable and helpful with prenatal items in the video. Not town toon her voice is so soothing and calming. I really enjoy the flow of the classes as well. Overall this yoga video and practice with this yoga instructor was just what I was looking for. It was perfect for me it was not to slow or relaxed like some like to treat prenatal classes yet it was not over exerting it was a great mix and very comfortable and easy for me to listen to and follow at home. Will be buying these to give as gifts for my friends who are having children.,1376956800,4,717,4.318518518518519
8598691,5,B00DWBNTMK,"The more I did this video during my pregnancy the better I felt! I used this video 3-4 a week in my third trimester and ended up feeling better than I did in my second trimester, when I was only doing yoga once a week. It's the #1 pregnancy item I recommend to friends when they become pregnant.",1375574400,5,295,4.103448275862069
8598692,5,B00DWBNTMK,"I loved this video. Laurel's voice is so calming and relaxing. The poses were great for my baby belly - not too difficult to follow, and I felt so good after.",1375574400,2,158,4.129032258064516
8598693,5,B00DWBNTMK,I purchased this DVD (and a few others) because I found it difficult to make it to the prenatal yoga class offered in my town.  I was frustrated that I couldn't find one that I really liked -- this one hit home.  It has a wonderful serenity to it and it didn't make me feel like I needed to be a professional yogi to practice with it.  It is down-to-earth and inspiring.  I liked the flow of the practice and the teacher was very knowledgeable of pregnant women.  After doing a little research she seems to be a very experienced yoga teacher and offers one of the only teacher trainings for prenatal yoga in Canada -- she must be good!  What I learned through this DVD also helped me during my natural births -- I used the techniques to ease myself through labour and delivery.  I'm going to be buying this as a gift for friends!,1375488000,4,829,4.2756410256410255
