8153808,4,B000K14LO0,"The WAVES Virtual Vacations DVDs are spectacular!  But, I do recommend buying a different WAVES DVD than this one.  I bought the Sampler to see which location/DVD I wanted to buy first, and while I love the WAVES stuff and have several, this particular one is my least favorite.  They tried to cram in so many locations into the sampler that some scenes are only 7 seconds long (hardly relaxing... more like a frenetic slideshow) and included some noisy animal close-ups!  Despite not recommending the ""sampler"", I completely recommend the WAVES collection.  [Note to the WAVES creaters/staff: screeching seals, etc are for a animal documentary, NOT for a calming beach getaway. It's one thing to have animals enter a scene as nature dictates, but animal specific shots are inappropriate and distracting.]",1220486400,6,805,5.114503816793893
