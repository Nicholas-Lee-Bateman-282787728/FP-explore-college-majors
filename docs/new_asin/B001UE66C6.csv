8343421,5,B001UE66C6,This DVD had several segments; all were excellent and dealt with different aspects of mummies discovered in different parts of the world. Extremely well done! I hope there are more to come; I will buy them.,1261958400,,206,4.75
8343422,3,B001UE66C6,"Title and description sound better than the actual show.  As with many of the Smithsonian Channel shows, this is fluff.  Very superficial treatment of what should have been a very interesting topic.  Are these shows produced for children?  If so, I guess they would be somewhat adequate.",1247356800,2,287,5.042553191489362
