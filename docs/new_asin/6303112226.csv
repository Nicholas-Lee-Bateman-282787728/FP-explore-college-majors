8272182,4,6303112226,"This dvd is great! I would recommend this dvd to all bob marley fans. But not just bob marley. With performances by Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, Jacob Miller, Marcia Griffiths, And others. This dvd also includes the 1978 ""One Love Peace Concert"",featuring Bob Marley. With songs like, ""Natty Dread"", ""War"",""Jah live"", and ""Jammin'"". This dvd is simply great. Even though the sound quality and picture isn,t that great but brings my rating down to four stars. This is still a great dvd though.",1049500800,4,489,4.903614457831325
