1193747,5,B000006FFU,"I was amazed at how this movie was able to tug at my heart. The performance of Lucy Deakins and Jay Underwood was superb. This is the type of movie that I can watch with my children and feel good about. Some might call it a simple movie, but it beats a lot of movies that I have watched. If you like this movie, another movie that I recommend is Mr. Destiny.",985910400,,358,3.986111111111111
1193748,4,B000006FFU,"The Boy Who Could Fly is a lovely family film with dark overtones that for the most part keep it from becoming too sappy. I love coming back now and then to this film to watch it, even though I find the ending to be a bit  too literally fantastic when everything leading up to that has been in a  more realistic or dream-like vein. The cast is excellent, and like everyone  else I love Lucy Deakins and want to see her back in films...what a  natural, heartfelt performance. Jay Underwood is also heartbreaking. Little  Fred Savage is wonderful; I love the scene where he runs out in the rain to  dig up his buried toy soldiers--it reminds me of the scene in Meet Me in  St. Louis when Margaret O'Brien knocks over her snowpeople.
I'd like to  make a special mention of Bruce Broughton's lovely music score, one of the  best of the decade.",962150400,3,839,4.361290322580645
1193749,5,B000006FFU,"After moving into a new house, the Michaelson family discover that an autistic boy named Eric lives next door. Milly Michaelson(Lucy Deakins) befriends Eric(Jay Underwood) and learns that ever since Eric's parents died in a plane crash, he pretends to fly. Eric lives with his Uncle Hugo Gibb(Fred Gwynne from The Munsters) who is not fit to take care of Eric because he is often drunk. As a result, Eric is occasionally institutionalized since it is feared that his pretending to fly will harm him. Thanks to Mrs. Sherman(Colleen Dewhurst) - Milly and Eric's school teacher, Eric is brought back home. Mrs. Sherman one day asks Milly to help Eric. Milly keeps a daily journal on her efforts which seem fruitless. Near the end, Eric tries to escape from the people who come to institutionalize him, and Milly follows trying to help Eric escape. They end up on the roof of their school, Taft High. Unfortunately, they are followed onto the roof and have nowhere else to run. They walk towards the edge of the roof, threatening to jump!
The magical ending of this great movie will surely leave you with goosebumps and exhilarate you.
Milly: We're all a little like Eric. Maybe we can't soar off into the clouds. But somewhere, deep inside, we can all fly.
Also in the movie are Fred Savage from ""The Wonder Years,"" who plays Milly's small brother, and Mindy Cohn from ""The Facts of Life,"" who plays Milly's neighborhood friend.
Highly recommended. A great family movie.",920764800,,1467,4.8023715415019765

1193754,5,B000006FFU,I like Jay Underwood who was also in the not quite human trilogy this film however underwood plays an teenager named Eric who lost his parents when he was 5. He doesn't talk due to a condition known as autism and lives with an alcoholic uncle but a family next door mainly the daughter help him out. The Family next door have recently lost the father/husband due to suicide after discovering he had cancer and didn't want to put his family and himself through the pain of the disease slowly killing him. The daughter Milly and Eric go on a school trip where Milly has a fall but doesn't hurt herself she insists Eric flew and saved her.

1193781,3,B000006FFU,"THE BOY WHO COULD FLY
Great performances by Actress Lucy Deakins who plays Milli
and Jay underwood who plays the Boy
originally released as snapcase dvd way back in 1998
with Digitally remastered transfer 1:85:1 ratio & Dolby digital stereo mix
which does look & sound much better picture quality than the old VHS tape
there's still some Grain & dirt in the transfer but better than VHS quality for sure
warner have given some respect to the film by adding some extras if that.
an Audio commentary with writer/Director Nick castle & actors Jay underwood & Luck Deakins
actress Bonnie bedelia is listed on the back cover as a participant but she's not heard on the commentary
which tells me that it's a lie Bonnie's not on the commentary
nethertheless the commentary is worth listening to anyway
there's also a 5min introduction to the film by Nick castle & Jay underwood only
Lucy Deakins is printed on the introduction back cover
but it's only Nick & Jay doing the Intro, pretty pathetic
it's Bulls*** marketing by warner bros to give you info on the back cover that's actually false, what else is new with warners
tragically Lucy Deakins who played Milli left the acting business back in the 90's
to become a Lawyer and raise a family, fair enough i guess

Warner bros have reissued the dvd again as part of their Warner archive collection in clamshell dvd case
not a snapcase, and there's a big difference between the 2 packaging
i tried to find out some info if the extras from the old snapcase have been carried over this new dvd reissue
i couldn't find any info on that
so as far as i know only the film & the original trailer have been carried over to this new dvd reissue
so probably best to buy the 1998 snapcase dvd if you want the Audio commentary & 5min intro aswell
4 stars for the film, 2-3 stars for this dvd",1469404800,,1823,4.490963855421687

1193964,4,B000006FFU,"Sappy? Yeah, I guess at times but this also mostly earns its big heart, and treats early teens with more far dignity and insight than most films.

Lucy Deakins is terrific as an intelligent, thoughtful 14 year old, who slowly grows to care for the autistic boy next door. He doesn't speak, but dreams only of flying away, a condition brought on by the deaths of his parents in a plane crash years before. Now he's in the care of an alcoholic uncle (the always wonderful Fred Gwynne), and the powers that be think he might be better off being institutionalized.

Almost all the acting is top notch, which is crucial in this character based story. Jay Underwood walks various fine lines as the titular boy, named Eric. By turns mysterious, locked in, charming he seems believable as an emotionally isolated adolescent as well as a possible source of magic. Colleen Dewhurst doesn't have a lot of screen time, but makes something rich and real out of a concerned teacher who doesn't want to see Eric locked away, knowing it will kill his spirit. And Bonnie Bedelia makes a touching warm and understanding widowed mom.

There are some scenes where the comic relief is more than a little forced, and a sub-plot about a little brother taking on neighborhood bullies seems grafted on from a far more Disney-ish film. But this Capra-esque gentle, bittersweet fantasy is a great 1980s film for tweens even today, and not a bad one for adults as well.",1422489600,,1441,4.687747035573122

1194066,5,B000006FFU,"It seems the most recent review was from back in 2003, So I thought I would chime in here.

First, This Fred Savage was prior to Wonder Years.
Then There is Mindy Cohn from before Facts of Life and
Fred Gwynne from the Muster's Herman fame
of course there must be recognition for Colleen Dewhurst.

Fred Savage was a good actor as a kid... and since he was a kid in this film, the acting skill definately shines through... and working with child actors usually leaves a pasty feel the way the first two movies in the Harry Potter did with the Wonder Triplets.

There was the touch of magic to make the movie themes less intense as they could otherwise be, however the story itself is very well worked out so that everything in the final production produces a fantastic tail of rediscovery after tragic losses.

If you ever stop to watch something you might just pass by, this movie will NOT leave you feeling cheated. It is well worth the watch, and at Amazon price of $7 for the unlimited stream, well worth the price. I may even opt to get a hard copy dvd or Blue Ray for my home library... we shall see though.

By the way -- this is a fairly family friendly movie, but does contain some ""bullying"" sequences and some child-sensitive (for the early 80s) ideas, ""this isn't water in the sqirtgun, it's piss."" ... of course this would not even be offensive by the standards of 2013.

But it still works.

You know what, just watch the movie and you will know why modern movies just don't match the older stuff for quality.",1374364800,7,1523,4.398576512455516
1194067,4,B000006FFU,This movie is good for those who like to imagine a lot. I saw this as a kid and I like watching it sometimes.,1370908800,,109,3.5833333333333335
1194068,5,B000006FFU,"""The Boy Who Could Fly"" was one of those movies for us 80s kids that you remember seeing a lot on HBO and watched dozens of times, only to discover later on that the movie was practically non-existent at the box office and has become a forgotten film that hardly anyone knows. But for those of us who know and remember, it remains a very fond memory from a time when they still made great movies like this.

The movie centers on young Milly (the adorable Lucy Deakins), who moves into a new home with her mom and little brother, Lewis. Milly soon learns of the strange boy, Eric Gibb (Jay Underwood), who lives next door. He doesn't speak and sits on his second story window sill pretending to be a plane and flying. Milly soon befriends the young boy and learns that they are both dealing with significant losses in their life. Can Milly break Eric out of his shell? Can he be saved from the people who want to send him to an institution? And can he really fly?

""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is a movie that I am re-discovering for the first time in over 20 years. It's been hard to get. I am happy to say that the movie has completely charmed me all over again with that ""only in the 80s"" sense of awe and wonder and complete and total magic. It's a fantasy that is grounded in the real world with two teenage characters who are suffering losses in their lives and end up finding kindred spirits in each other. It's a classic tale that is wonderfully and upliftingly told in a way that could not be done in our hard edged, cynical, super-realistic movies of today. Why is that? Come on, Hollywood! Even though the movie has a whimsical tone and a fantasy element, it relies on these two main characters and the recent struggles they've been through and continue to go through. It's touching and moving without piling it on too much, and makes you feel and inspires you.

The movie is helped along with a truly outstanding supporting cast. This includes Bonnie Bedelia (TV's ""Parenthood"", ""Die Hard""), Fred Savage (""The Wonder  Years""), Mindy Cohn (""The Facts Of Life""), Fred Gwynne (""The Munsters""), Colleen Dewhurst, and a special cameo appearance by Louise Fletcher (""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""). The film was written and directed by Nick Castle, who also did the wonderful 1984 film, ""The Last Starfighter"", and also played Michael Meyers in the original ""Halloween"" movie. It is a very solid and capable cast. There's Someone here for past generations who will be delighted in seeing, especially Herman Munster himself. Everyone is wonderful and believable in their roles. But our main two stars are the focus. Lucy Deakins is beautiful in that sweet, lovely, girl-next-door look. Why did she disappear? And Jay Underwood wonderfully brings Eric to life.

""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is a wonderful and hopeful movie that brought back so many wonderful memories. As I mentioned before, it's a movie I hadn't seen in two decades or more. The second it started, I remembered every single scene, every frame, and it was a delight. It was a special movie back then, and it deserves to continue to be so and delight and attract new generations of fans. Seriously, why can't we still make movies like this that so once meant something to us in childhood?",1369526400,3,3251,4.607944732297064

1194082,4,B000006FFU,I found this movie inspirational.  It provided a definition of faith that is unswerving.

That is unmatched determination of a sort to which I fully aspire!,1353888000,,262,4.777777777777778
1194083,5,B000006FFU,"I want to start out this review by saying that I love this movie.  It has a special quality that I can't quite put my finger on, but I think it encourages one to look beyond oneself and to think on deeper matters.  It's a bit disturbing at times, but at the same time it is a touching love story.  There are a lot of lessons presented in this movie including learning to trust and love again after tremendous personal loss.  Also, that there is hope, and we should not give up despite tragic circumstances or difficulties in life.

Eric and Millie are both dealing with death in different ways.  Eric's parents died in a plane crash when he was very young and after that point, living with his uncle who is an alcoholic, he retreats into a world that seems similar to autism. I looked online to see if emotional disturbance could cause autism, and I came up blank, except that Bruno Bethleheim was an ""expert"" who believed that autism was caused by traumatic experiences because the children affected had unloving mothers. Autism experts believe this to be a dark time in the field of Autism, and his ideas weren't followed for long, fortunately.  I don't suppose it matters why Eric withdraws, but I think that the beauty of this story is that two people learn to love each other unconditionally despite their setbacks or disabilities.  Millie is on a similar journey to Eric in that she is dealing with the loss of her father to suicide.  I feel the white rose with a hint of pink, represents hope in the presence of grieving from the loss of a loved one.

Putting all the deep meanings aside, as one can appreciate this movie on two different levels; I think it is a touching love story with lots of special moments that those with romantic sensibilities can enjoy.  I love the cloud dream sequence, wow!  The acting is superb especially by Lucy Deakins who plays Millie.  Fred Savage is just adorable as the younger brother.  Jay Underwood presents an outstanding and believable portrayal of Eric, so much so that you feel you really know him. There is only a very mimimal amount of language that will be offensive to some.

I'd recommend this fantasy story that hits closer to home than most movies about true reality ever could!",1307923200,,2234,4.577889447236181

These movies beat the s.... out of the newer ""digitally"" animated Superman movies (surely there is a new franchise coming up!).  Enjoy.",1190505600,,494,4.732558139534884
1194105,5,B000006FFU,"Well, here's a film that got past me in the 1980's.  This is a great pure fantasy and light romance film for the whole family.  I myself have a very active dream state and often have dreams where I'm flying in my dreams or where I'm young again.  It's a great escape from the harsh realities of this world and a great gift to have. So if you too, have dreams of flying and wish it would really happen to you, this film is for you!

Plot wise, this story is a no brainier. A young girl named Milly, played by Lucy Deakins, moves into a new neighborhood with her mom Charlene, played by Bonnie Bedelia, along with Lewis, her younger brother, played by Fred Savage.  This was Fred Savage's first motion picture film which got his career started, for those of you who loved him in ""The Wonder Years"".

The family has lost their father and Charlene, their mother, is working to hold them together.  The mother has to reintegrate back into the world of insurance having been away for 13 years from that type of work, while trying to wrestle with learning computers. Both brother and sister have to integrate into a new neighborhood and new school with its harsh realities.  Lewis's main challenge, throughout the whole film, is to try and get past the bullies living down the street, just to finally get around the block, which he finally manages toward the end of the film. This may seem like no real challenge to you as an adult or if you have forgotten your own childhood, but I remember the bullies I grew up with and when kids are bigger than you, they can scare the bejeebers out of you if you are 7 or 8 years old.

I can also equate to the new neighborhood the family moves into, given my own parent's divorce and the number of schools we went through growing up while they fought against each other. It's no fun on the kids when the parents divorce, but in this case, its worse on the kids given they have lost their dad to death before the movie starts. The part were Lewis is out in the rain trying to dig for his army men, not wanting to quit, like he feels his father did, who died of cancer or suicide, started to bring tears to my eyes.  What a great talent Fred Savage had and he was perfect for this movie.

Across from them lives a young boy, a savant or autistic kid named Eric, played by Jay Underwood, who has a secret ability he wants no one to know about for fear they might lock him up as a scientific curiosity, which is made clear at the end of the film. The boy does not speak until the end of the film, but is bright minded under his demeanor nevertheless. Jay was pretty cute when he played the role.  Both Lucy and he make for a cute pair on screen.

The story is more a light love story between Jay's character, Eric, and Lucy's character, Milly, and I think Nick Castle does a convincing job pulling off the whole thing including the way it ends and why it must end the way it does.

Throughout the whole story you are asked the question whether this boy can really fly and don't find out until the very end if he really can.  Fred Gwynne, who plays Eric's uncle an alcoholic, drinks because he thinks he has seen Eric fly, but tops it off to the fact he's getting old and losing his mind. Colleen Duhurst's character greatly adds to the chemistry of this film as Jay's teacher, who protects Jay from the state mental authorities; bringing the whole thing down to earth in their title roles. If some other review tells you how the film ends, I won't. You must see it and I think you will enjoy it if you ever wished as a kid to have the ability to fly.

This is a great film for the whole family. No violence or anyone killed.  Just a beautiful story and a chance to escape the world as you watch it. It was films like this that made the golden years of the motion picture business, before the whole world went insane with all its violence on the big screen.

Also listen to the commentary audio with the film.  It is very well done.",1189123200,,3959,4.247669773635153

1194127,5,B000006FFU,"Some argue that this film takes a wrong turn at the end, but then I guess that depends on your own personal outlook on life. In my opinion, this film is pure perfection from the first frame until the last. Truly a classic from the 80's and for all time.

1194130,4,B000006FFU,"The 80s had a lot of great movies from a variety of genres. And with the bevy of great teen flicks, it's easy to forget or overloook a few gems, especially if you didn't catch them during their first runs at the theater or on TV. ""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is one of those kind of movies. It didn't get the kind of attention, publicity or promotion that, say, the John Hughes-Brat Pack teen flicks did. But box office aside, this movie didn't need it. It stands on its own feet. Though this movie didn't star what could be considered any big names at the time, a lot of great performances by ""soon to bees"" give this movie a true heart. Since this movie isn't saturated with dialogue or contain a steady pace of action, the heartwarming story is accomplished through fine direction that gets outstanding performances from the entire cast: the adorable and accomplished Lucy Deakins, a very young Fred Savage, Bonnie Bedelia (pre-""Die-Hard""), Mindy Cohn (""Facts of Life""), Colleen Dewhurst, Fred Gwynne (whom directors in the 80s finally realized could act without his Herman Munster costume), and a cameo by effectively typecast Louise Fletcher. It's a great mix of young actors and experienced veterans who create an inspiring, touching story that provides encouraging lessons with such subtlety, you wonder where that lump in your throat came from by the movie's end. I always wanted to see more of Deakins and was disappointed she made so few movies. But I was more impressed to see what she'd done with herself around her movie career. With such a background it's easy to see why her performance as Milly seemed so effortless. The scent of the 80s is evident in this movie in a few ways (the least being the cast itself) which makes it even more ""comfort food"" for those of us who first saw it back then.",1172793600,2,1805,4.661442006269592
1194131,4,B000006FFU,"The Boy Who Could Fly is a feel good film about plane crashes, mental illness, and alcoholism.  I guess you could argue that it's also about a boy.  The boy who could fly.  The film revolves around the interactions of an autistic, depressed, mute, withdrawn guy whose parents died in a plane crash and his average, non-cheerleader, nicey nice, cute new next-door neighbor.  He's an outcast.  She's an outcast.  Naturally they get together.  She attempts to connect with him.  They play catch.  It's all very sweet.  Inevitably they fly.  Although the flying part is never really explained.  I'm thinking, much like the show Heroes, it must have been a genetic mutation brought on by the trauma of losing loved ones.  The movie features several well knowns actors in various stages of their careers.  It also shows underage drinking, smoking, and an alcoholic uncle that will make you want to cry.

I mean, really... it's super amazing.

get a vhs version... invite a couple of friends over... share some beer... and prepare to have the time of your life.

I mean, I have to admit to you...i've only seen it from the middle because we didn't rewind it all the way...but that almost makes it better.

See...it's about this wierd mute kid...and he can fly.

there's even a kissing scene. with fireworks.

And it has the little boy from the wonder years... the princess bride... boy meets world's brother... and this other classic called 'Dinosaurs... a fun-filled trip back in time!""

talk about a superb cast.

Oh, and the boy who can fly, 'Eric', yeah... he's in other movies too. I mean, I can't remember what movies. But he looks really familiar.

I mean, this character.. 'Eric'... is amazing. Big number one... he can fly. Number two... he can fly in the rain. Number three... he can fly, in the rain, wearing a straight jacket. I mean, how cool is this kid? Really, we should have america vote on it.

Oh, and there's this chick... her name is Millie. I mean, I wouldn't have been able to remeber it... but he says it really slow at the end of the movie when they're about to jump off a building. It's the only word he ever says... well... besides 'I love you' and 'Good bye'. Yeah. You can guess what happens.

I mean, I don't really want to give away the movie... but I already did.

But that's okay, because it's almost better that way.

Plus... that little kid... he like... goes out and rocks the world. He beats up these bullies, and like, kills a whole bunch of people.

It's so awesome, you have to see it. That's why it's a wholesome family film.

Make sure to watch it with really sweet naive children with big watery eyes. They'll become men. Even if they're girls.

To sum it up... buy this movie, cuz... 'Eric'... he can fly.",1145059200,2,1898,4.442196531791907
1194136,5,B000006FFU,"Mrs. Michaelson (Bonnie Bedelia) and her two children Milly (Lucy Deakins) and Louis (Fred Savage) have just moved into a new neighborhood following the recent death of their husband/Father. They hope to begin a new life and make new friends as the try to deal with the grief of their loss.

While trying to deal with her own personal grief, Milly finds an unexpected friend in Eric (Jay Underwood) the strange boy next store who never speaks and stands on the roof of his house with arms spread as though he were an airplane getting ready to take flight.

After a little investigation she discovers that Eric lost both parents in a plane crash and hasn't spoken or communicated with anyone since. Milly decides to break through the wall he has built around himself and lead him back to wholeness. As you might have guessed by now feelings other than just friendship soon develop between the two disinfranchised teenagers.

'The Boy Who Could' is an absolutely wonderful tale of hope, belief and the healing power of love. Lucy Deakins is one of the most charming and beautiful young women I've ever seen on film and was absolutely perfect for this role. The entire cast is excellent as well, especially Fred Savage as the little brother.

Truly one of the four or five greatest family movies ever made!",1143417600,38,1303,4.726872246696035
1194157,5,B000006FFU,"Ahhh, ""The Boy Who Could Fly."" This is a film that I grew up with and still share with my family today. This is a true inspirational film that is for all ages and families across the miles and sends a wonderful message to those who have been through pain, been down on their luck, or just simply want to believe in something positive. This message is brought forth through an unlikely pair who with their friendship and love, literally learn to fly.

Millie Michaelson (played by the lovely Lucy Deakins) is a shy 14 year-old who, along with her mother (played by the talented Bonnie Bedelia) and kid brother Louis, (played by a very young Fred Savage) is struggling to come to grips with the tragic death of her father. They are the new family on the block, at work and at school as they try to rebuild their lives after moving into a new home. They all struggle with the normal hassles of life. Louis, who tries to act tough and wants to be a soldier like the G.I. Joe's he plays with, faces neighborhood bullies who won't let him get around the block and keeps getting in trouble at school. Millie, who becomes friends with Geneva (played by the hilarious Mindy Cohn), goes through the coming-of-age rituals of adjusting to a new school and the popular girls and the temptations of alcohol. Mrs. Michaelson struggles with learning how to use a computer in the insurance business (and keep in mind, this movie was made in 1986 when computers were still relatively new).

But from the moment Millie first sets foot in her new home, she finds out that they have not moved into any ordinary neighborhood. The strange boy next door instantly intrigues Millie. Eric Gibb (a magnificent performance from Jay Underwood) lives with his lazy, alcoholic uncle (played by the convincing and entertaining Fred Gwynne) and does not speak nor does he show emotion. But one thing he does do is sit on the windowsill and pretend to fly. Nobody can seem to get through to him and nobody can really understand him accept that he may be autistic. But Millie learns that Eric's own deep dark tragedy concerning his parents is likely reflected in his obsession with flying.

Eric is in Millie's class at school, taught by Ms. Sherman (played by the late, extraordinary Colleen Dewhurst). Sherman, who has been helping Eric for quite a while, notices a connection between he and Millie. She sees Eric doing things around Millie that no doctor could do with him. Millie agrees to help Ms. Sherman by spending time with Eric in an effort to break him of his emotional disturbances and keep him out of the mental institution and the workers there who have been after him. Millie reads to Eric, plays with him in gym class, has lunch with him everyday at school, makes paper airplanes with him and he even comes home with Millie for dinner with her family.

As Millie and Eric get closer, Millie seems to find the true Eric hiding behind his emotion-less face. The two develop a very special relationship. All the while, dramatic things happen, which test their love and friendship for one another, from Millie's concussion during a fall, to Eric's run-in with the institution, to the chase they have with the institution workers, to the dramatic climax on the roof. But the hardest test of all comes after their flight, however from that day forward, things start taking a better turn for Millie and her family and even Eric's uncle.

But in the long run, Millie and her family realize that Eric was perhaps a symbol of what we can all do if we try, wish and love enough. When we feel like life is too much we can remember Eric Gibb and how he could teach us all to fly. I think Millie taught Eric to really fly in more ways than one. Millie was there for Eric during a time of need and she lifted him out from under his shell if you will. In turn, Eric taught Millie to fly with his inspiration to wish, dream and love. And look what came of it? Millie learned that anything is possible if we wish, dream and love enough. Louise Fletcher made a brief appearance as a psychiatrist, Dr. Grinada who talked with Millie after she had gotten a concussion. She told Millie: ""Sometimes you have to believe in a little magic, especially when there's so much pain."" And rightfully so. Both Millie and Eric have dealt with tremendous pain in their lives, but with each other, they both learned to fly together.

This movie is absolutely superb for the family. It sends such a positive message to those who may feel discouraged in life. But it is also inspiring to those who do not get discouraged easily. It's just a nice, feel-good story; a true heartfelt drama with plenty of real emotion, and even action. The cast is outstanding. All do a tremendous job. Lucy Deakins and Bonnie Bedelia are excellent at portraying deep emotion from tears to anger. Jay Underwood does a superb job of playing the emotionally disturbed Eric Gibb. He is so believable. He can go from having no emotion to just the right amount of it at the right time. Jay is indeed a very versatile actor who can touch on all the human emotions effectively. Then there's little Fred Savage, who actually adds comic relief to the film with his macho attitude. Mindy Cohn is awesome as Geneva. She may play a small part, but she's such a kick. The music of the film is beautiful and they even throw in some special effects complete with fireworks, as you'll see in Millie's dream sequence. The special features are a real treat, with a really cool theatrical trailer, and introduction featuring Jay Underwood and a commentary with Underwood, Lucy Deakins, Fred Savage and director Nick Castle. Together, they are quite an entertaining bunch who sound like they're decent ordinary people have a great time talking with one another and the audience about their personal experiences with the film and various other stories.

When I was a little kid. I loved this movie because all I knew was that it was about a flying boy that was strange. Well, it goes much deeper than that!",1139443200,9,6009,4.599813432835821

1194161,5,B000006FFU,"This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was about in middle school. It touches on the imagination and also the real world. It's about a family coming to grips from losing their father and a wife dealing with losing her husband and starting a new life in a new town. Milly meets their neighbor Eric Gibb who is Autistic (a subject that was touched really before any one else had and that isn't really even talked about or shown in movies sadly). She tries to open him up and she ends up finding a special friendship with in him not only that helps Eric, but helps her own family come closer together. Directed by Nick Castle this movie has an amazing cast: Milly: Lucy Deakins, Eric Gibb: Jay Underwood, Bonnie Bedelia: Charlene Michaelson, Fred Savage (in his first movie): Louis Michaelson, the amazing Colleen Dewhurst: Mrs. Sherman, Fred Gwynne: Uncle Hugo, Mindy Cohn (Facts of Life fame): Geneva ... also interestingly enough you may pick out Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) as a kind nurse, & a very young Jason Priestly. The DVD extra's are awesome I personally love the commentary of Lucy, Jay, Fred, and Nick Castle. This movie is really a family movie and is very touching. Some may not understand the film as a whole, but you have to watch it with a kind heart and an imagination to really fully understand it emotionally. There's a lot of fun moments in the film as well to mix in with the emotional drama. Again it's for the whole family to enjoy and has always been a favorite young adult movie for me.",1092441600,4,1541,4.507142857142857
1194162,1,B000006FFU,"I understand some folks may like this film, but I found it to be one of the worst films ever made.  Why is it so bad?  Let's see:

The plot: there isn't one.  A bunch of people whose lives are so screwed up that they walk around like zombies, wallowing in their own self-absorption until one day a boy who supposedly has autism flies around the town!  Come to think of it, he didn't have autism - he was an alien flying home at the end!

The acting: nonexistent.  The boy who has autism, Eric, does a terrible job.  One of the core chracteristics of autism is difficulty seeing the perspective of another person (theory of mind).  Eric doesn't show this at all - in fact he displays excellent joint attending and reading nonverbal communication!  Oh yeah, he mumbles a few words like Frankenstein's monster, so I guess some people think people with autism walk around like idiots.  The other actors are all flat - no characterization whatsoever.  There are plenty of stereotypes in the film, including some neighborhood thugs whom apparently have nothing better to do than pick on a very young Fred Savage.  Which goes back to the plot - what was the point of that bullying?

The soundtrack: really bad 80's drivel.  Cheesy lyrics with synthesizers and machine drums.  The excitement of the film is underscored by this boring music.

The special effects: a joke.  This film was made in 1986 and the flying scenes incorporated the same technology as 1978's Superman with Christopher Reeve.

Save your time and your money.  Watch Rain Man or I Am Sam instead.",1092009600,,1557,4.654411764705882
1194163,4,B000006FFU,"""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is such a rarity in the genre.  This is not so much a kid's movie, as it is a full-blooded drama that happens to have kids as characters.  It tells the story of a family, suffering the loss of their father/husband.  The decline in income requires them to move into a ""fixer upper"" home in a quiet residential neighborhood.  The eldest child, Millie (beautifully played by Lucy Deakins) becomes fascinated with the teenage autistic boy next door, Eric (Jay Underwood) who sits in his window all day and pretends to fly.  Through circumstances at school, Millie takes him on as a ""project."" As her kindly teacher(Colleen Dewhurst) points out, ""Doctors haven't been able to get a word out of him.  Maybe a friend could.""  She tries to draw him out of his condition through every day activities, and over time, the form a very close connection, and even fall in love.  Meanwhile, Millie must deal with the burdens of home, trying to reconcile the suicide of her father, and her very stressed out and grief-stricken mother(the wonderful Bonnie Bedelia), who is trying to get back into the work force.
While there is certainly more to the story than this, it would be a shame to spoil details for those who have not seen this film.  It is uncommonly intelligent, charming, and very moving.  It speaks in the language of children, without ever becoming condescending or silly, even when the film's more fantastic elements are revealed.  The story and its characters feel real.  Their grief feels real.  Their longing to believe in happy endings feels real.
The performances are outstanding.  Lucy Deakins and Jay Underwood are entirely convincing.  It's so rare to see a teenage girl portrayed with this kind of uncynical intelligence.  Underwood's Eric barely has any lines in the film, but instead, like a young Harrison Ford, communicates so much in his face that we hardly notice.  This is a teen romance for the ages.
The adult players are also fine.  Bonnie Bedelia, one of the most convincing actors or our era, plays Charlene as tough yet fragile, nurturing but flawed. The late Colleen Dewhurst is lovely and compassionate as Mrs. Sherman.
Surprisingly the film has been written and directed by Nick Castle, known for such disappointments as ""Mr. Wrong"" and ""The Last Starfighter.""  He is better known as being the 1st actor to play Michael Myers in the original ""Halloween.""  This is his best film by far. He should try to make more films along these lines.  We sure need them.
I hope people will show this film to their kids some day.  It is a reminder that films about kids used to be intelligent and authentic, not lobotomized, as I feel they have become over the past 15 years.  This film still gives me hope, and gives me the excuse to dream.",1080777600,4,2774,4.733333333333333

1194184,5,B000006FFU,"This is a story of two families.  One moves next to the other.  Both have suffered loss and are dealing with it in different ways.
On family has a teenaged daughter, a military minded child and a mother reentering the workforce.  The father recently died of cancer.
Next door is a drunkard uncle taking care of a silent boy who wants to fly.  His parents died in a plane crash and ever since he has been pretending to be an airplane as the only way to save them.
But when daughter becomes intrigued by the boy and begins to reach out to him, it becomes clear that the two share a connection.  She works with him and begins to get responses from him that no one else ever has.  This culminates in the end as the two try to prevent him from being placed back in an institution.
As a side story we have Fred Savage as the tricycle riding brother who wants to make it around the block but is always stopped by a gang of bullies.  He is almost defeated but eventually comes up with a plan that succeeds with flying colors.
This is not an emotional outpouring like The Breakfast Club (another excellent movie).  The plot is more subtle and the revelations quieter (most of them at least).  There are also quite subtleties that should be followed.  For instance, pay attention to the wind.

1194185,4,B000006FFU,"This film was absolutely fantastic! It reminded me of one of those TV movies or a true-life film, which my mum watches constantly, and they don't normally appeal to me. It was a bit slow to start with, and I really didn't think it was going to enjoy it. After watching the trailer, which didn't impress me, I didn't think it would be any good, but the turning point for me would be when Eric smiles for the first time.
Jay Underwood played the part brilliantly and you could almost feel that he enjoyed playing the role of Eric. He was lucky not to have a script with loads of lines to learn! Although he never quite managed to say ""Millie"" (of course not, she gave him the wrong mouth shapes), he managed to poignantly say that he loved Millie, before he flew away, and never returned. I wanted to know what happened to him! Where's the sequel?
Lucy Deakins annoyed me throughout the whole film, as I know her from somewhere. She looks so familiar, but I didn't recognise any of the films she'd appeared in listed in the extras. She also reminds me very much of a young Heather Graham, especially on the front cover, and at certain points throughout the film. I don't know whether it's the blue eyes, or the airbrushed clear skin. She just did.
Bonnie Bedelia played the mother, and although she doesn't appear very much in the film, I recognised her too. She probably stars in a lot of the TV movies that my mum watches.
The one character who made me want to throw something at the TV, was the actress who played Geneva. Talk about annoying! Her voice totally grated. Thankfully, she didn't have a very big starring role, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to watch it.
If you're a fan of `Anne Of Green Gables' (I know I am, considering we've just bought all 3 DVDs), look out for Colleen Dewhurst. She played Marilla Cuthbert in `Anne', and plays Mrs Sherman in this film, one of the teachers.
Also, if you're a fan of `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', then look out for a small role, of the psychiatrist who comes to see Millie after her fall from the bridge. None other than Nurse Ratchett, played by Louise Fletcher!
This film is a must-see. But get some tissues.",1059955200,,2172,4.4325
1194186,4,B000006FFU,"I'm so tired of modern family movies full of fart jokes or movies where teenagers make love to pastries and it's supposed to be funny and then they staple on some superficial message at the end in an attempt to be poignant and balance out all the trash that came before. Every other week we are tortured with some nonsense of this caliber and whenever I wish for a movie that stands out from the crowd I have to go back in time and consider some overlooked gem. The Boy Who Could Fly is exactly that.

The characters seem so real and their emotions genuine, it builds at a slow pace but it never gets boring and story development is consistent. This is not a ferociously loud summer crowd-pleaser or something bloated with pointless SFX. Very few movies have the power to make a whole story out of characters and situation alone without feeling the need for some ridiculous set piece or blaring thrash metal guitars.

In fact Bruce Broughton's score is the wonderful opposite of that. The performances, especially the two leads, are flawless and the direction is far more refined than the typical. Everything in this movie comes together perfectly to make a film so unique and charming. If you have lost your faith in the current dreck that graces our screens and if you want a family movie with some meaning and subtext then check this out. And keep an eye out for director John Carpenter as on of the Coupe De Villes.

Fred Savage adds just the right comic element, to soften the darker aspect of the movie.
And then, there's the fantasy element.  At first, I was disturbed by the sheer fantasy that isn't revealed until the climax of the film.  It just seemed as to realistic a film to have such an ending.  And yet, I found it somehow refreshing, and yet it's the fantasy which in spite of the title, just didn't come off for me, and that's the only reason for my not feeling that it deserves five stars.
All in all, though, this is a movie to watch and to enjoy.  There's just enough real life sense of tragedy in the young people's background here to keep it from being overly sweet.",1028764800,3,872,4.493670886075949

It's completely fiction and almost science fiction but it works. Jay Underwood plays a boy orphaned because of plane accident. He becomes a recluse and a mute. Then his new neighbor a young girl who is also his age befriends him.
Convinced she can help him she makes an effort to communicate with him. He is a social misfit, however, he has one gift and talent that he keeps hidden well - he can fly.
A great premise and some good special wire effects (perfected because of the Superman films) the film is very simple but it has a sweet and warm chocolaty center. Bruce Broughton did a wonderful score for the film.
Special note: If you go to see a movie at the Hollywood's El Capitan - it is the score from this film that you hear as they open the curtains to view each movie. It is a wonderful score and cue that goes well with the film.
