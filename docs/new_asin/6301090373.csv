to making his pressence felt  as a force to be reckon with. while still a great lyricist and a voice
that is still soulful, his career musically there after has been hit and miss. this particular time  of his career
he was unstoppable and bad  bad.",1473206400,3,350,4.0144927536231885

He was sooo easy on the eyes and he knew it, using his almond-shaped green eyes, his picture perfect hair and his smooth dance moves to their full advantage.  The music is dance-able, his great singing is spot-on - especially during his stellar rendition of Who's Loving You -  and the rapport between him and his band the Bojangles is a total romp.  This is my all-time favorite work from TTD and it gives him full range to showcase his many talents.  Enjoy!",1363737600,2,572,4.461538461538462
