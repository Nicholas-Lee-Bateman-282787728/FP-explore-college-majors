4018299,5,B002ZG4QDO,"ONCE IN A WHILE A DOWN TO EARTH,FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF SMALL MOVIE WITH BIG DREAMS COMES ALONG AND REMINDS YOU WHAT A QUALITY FILM IS. YOU APPRECIATE ALL ITS FINE DETAILS AND ATTENTION TO CHARACTERIZATION AND THAT BRINGS YOU TO FROM MEXICO WITH LOVE. YOU SENSE THAT YOU ARE INSIDE THE FILM ITSELF. IT ALL LOOKS SO SIMPLE AND TRUE TO LIFE. THE LEADS ARE GOOD BUT THE SUPPORTING CAST ARE A PLEASURE TO WATCH AND LISTEN TOO. YOU TAKE A FILM LIKE AVATAR WITH ITS LANG ACTOR AND YOU FIND IT HERE IN THE DAD/RANCHER PATRON OF THE TOWN. MEANER THAN A JUNKYARD DOG AND A CHARACTER YOU LOVE TO HATE. OF COURSE THE TRAINER TO THE YOUNG UNDERDOG BOXER IS A CLASSIC ROCKY TYPE GUY. WITHOUT SPILLING TOO MUCH MORE OF THE STORY, GO BUY IT IF YOU WANT A SPIRITED DOWN TO THE BONE TALE OF DREAMS, DEFEAT AND FINAL REDEMPTION. ITS THAT GOOD.",1265932800,3,826,4.234177215189874

4018316,4,B002ZG4QDO,"It's a good film. I lost interest though because it's a lot like many other boxing films. The great thing about this story is the Mexicans get to get the money and return home to live better on their land. I only ordered this film because I'm a big fan of Steven Bauer. He does a great job in this, so do the other actors. I feel the writing could've been deeper.",1344902400,,363,4.055555555555555

4018318,4,B002ZG4QDO,"Year ago, boxing movies came in all shapes and sizes:  Classics like ""Champion"", ""Body & Soul"" and ""Golden Boy"" had well written scripts, big name stars and a decent enough budget to tell a story of corruption or conquering adversity while the fighter always got the ""right"" girl at the end of the movie.

Then there were boxing's ""B"" movies which had a moral to them, a shoestring budget, some comic relief and then the big boxing scene at the end.  Movies like ""Ringside Maisie"" and the ""Prizefighter And The Lady"" even had then heavyweight champion Max Baer!!!

A movie such as ""From Mexico With Love"" tells a story of a young man who deals with the narrowmindedness of a Texas ranch owner and his schooled fighter of a son.

From ""From Mexico With Love"" is as much a movie about a people who are proud but suffer at the hands of their employer and the pride, will and determination to pin their hopes on one young man out to beat the odds.

If you are a boxing fan and enjoy movies about boxing, there is enough story and plot line to keep your interest for the 96 or so minutes that the film uses to tell it's story.

Good action sequences, decent acting from a young cast and a few old timers including Bruce McGill and Steven Bauer make this a movie worth watching.

While not in the league of recent films such as ""Cinderella Man"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"", this movie can hold it's own as that second or ""B"" movie if you decide to spend an evening watching boxing films.

Don't forget to have some popcorn handy!!!!!!!!",1281830400,,1529,4.432142857142857
4018319,2,B002ZG4QDO,This film does deserve credit for the outstanding performances done but it's cast most of whom are newcomers.  The film sadly in many ways is a modern day latino incantation of the Blaxploitation genre of film of the 1970's.  Noble and heroic latino/hispanic people unite and trimumph over the evil anglo/white people.  The film is loaded with false stereotypes many young and often uneducated urban latinos have of anglo whites.  Given the  current climate in the country over immigration I would not show this film to young people if I were a parent of any race or ethnicity.,1271548800,,577,4.846938775510204
