7927212,3,B00004YA1B,"Produced for Canadian television, BAD FAITH is based upon a novel of the same name, and is scripted by the author of the original, Ian Adams, who has the honour of being the first English language writer commanded by a court to reveal sources of information used as landscape for a work of fiction, an earlier published tale of international espionage. The film and book are fabricated versions of events brought to light during the Lower Mainland Missing Children Case wherein a dozen youngsters were sexually assaulted and slain by Canada's most infamous serial murderer, Clifford Olson, with a petty criminal, or ""rounder"", being arrested for the crimes he may not have committed. The U.S. video edition is titled COLD BLOODED, a just choice as each featured player is unprincipled or on the verge of being so, with an investigative news writer (Tony Nardi) as the only partly sympathetic figure yet nonetheless unscrupulous in his journalistic selectivity as relating to honesty. Acting laurels must go to Brian Markinson who gives a bravura performance as an informant who could be the key to a law enforcement smoke screen that also involves the local attorney general's office, while there are numerous other fine turns, notably those contributed by Michael Moriarty, John Kapelos, and Paul Coeur. An accurate mise-en-scne is created by the producers of this capably directed and edited work shot in a hibernal Calgary and, despite a snarled plot that nearly obviates ready comprehension, there is a satisfying bite to the dialogue that lifts the noirish affair to a level beyond the norm.",1104883200,,1596,5.095419847328245
7927213,3,B00004YA1B,"COLD BLOODED is a complex, sometimes confusing, and ultimately frustrating mystery film.  Director Randy Bradshaw directs in a slow-moving, static manner, and the script is bogged down with so much conspiracy going on, it's hard to focus on exactly who the heroes and villains are.
Michael Moriarty is at his soporific worst in his portrayal of the assistant to the attorney general, acting like he'd much rather be at home doing crossword puzzles.
Gloria Reuben has little energy in her role as a possible serial killer's lawyer.
Patti LuPone needs to stick with musicals; her Barbra Streisand impersonation is fruitless.
Kenneth Welsh does a nasty turn as Officer Brodski, who's using a snitch that is possibly a serial killer.
The best acting in the cast comes from supporting actors who play the serial killer potential and the cop assisting Brodski.  Unfortunately, I can't recall their names and they're conspiculously missing from the box.
Plodding and slow, the movie would bear renting more than buying.",1074729600,2,1012,5.164634146341464
