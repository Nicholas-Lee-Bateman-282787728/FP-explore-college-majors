8677997,3,B00NGIPLM0,"A hitman and his driver retell a story about ""Gun Woman."" A rich sick individual (Noriaki Kamata), who would rape and kill women (not necessarily in that order) kills the wife of a doctor and cripples the doctor (Kairi Narita). In order to obtain revenge, the doctor buys and trains a meth head to do his killing. That is Asami , the title character.

The film has slightly more depth and a minor end twist, but that is basically the film. Toss in some blood, killing, and rape and you have a mediocre Japanese grindhouse.
