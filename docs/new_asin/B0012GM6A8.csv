8245851,5,B0012GM6A8,"It was a very good movie. I have watched the whole series. This is the second movie in the series. Sgt. Sharp has been promoted to Lt. Sharp for his actions in the ""Caparini Massacre"". Shape's squad is sent to an ice planet to investigate rumors of a facility mass producing cyborgs in ""The Mezzo Incident"". The rumors prove to be true and they have to fight their way out of the facility before it blows up. By now most of his old squad is dead.  In the last movie in this series ""The Gauda Prime Conspiracy"" they are sold out by a traitor and are captured. At the end of the credits they hinted at another movie which never came about. Too bad that they quit making the series.",1433289600,,679,4.223076923076923

8245853,5,B0012GM6A8,"Recon 2022: Mezzo Incident takes movie making to the next level. The acting is worthy of an Oscar on all counts. The SFX would make George Lucas and James Cameron blush. The creative use of a sock puppet is simply out of this world. The scenes on the ice world Mezzo remind one of the scenes on the ice planet Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back, only Recon 2022 takes the cinematography and action in these scenes to the next level. I simply cannot state how top notch the acting is in this movie. The dialog flows from one scene to the other, and the writers simply must be commended for this. To be sure, there are some nude scenes in this, but, they add so much to the story.  I can't wait for the next movie in this series, and hope that instead of a direct to DVD release, the sequels are released to theaters. A movie like this deserves the full IMAX 3D treatment.",1328918400,,867,4.22289156626506
8245854,1,B0012GM6A8,"Forty seconds into the film, there's a misspelled word in the opening title roll-up.  It's all downhill from there.  Wooden dialogue, inappropriate pauses, senseless nudity, Oh my!  I can't remember why I bought it, but I wish I hadn't.",1322784000,,236,5.0
8245855,2,B0012GM6A8,"Well, I must admit that this review is biased seeing as how I did not see the whole movie but only about half. But that was all I could handle of the stilted dialogue, ripped off-story lines, and most of all, gratuitous sexual crap thrown in for no good reason at all.
Most sci-fi movies require some suspension of belief and a little, if not a great deal, of viewer sympathy with the actors and the director's budgets but sometimes its a little too much.
My thought to you sci-fi fans is to pass this one up and to move on to more sophisticated, better made pictures.",1233619200,,568,4.317757009345795
8245856,4,B0012GM6A8,"I agree with the other reviewers in that these films rip some things from past blockbuster movies. I don't personally have an issue with that. The special effects at times are quite cheesy. However, these films have a little charm to them. I hope the series continues and evolves the story...and hopefully, the budget will increase a little bit over time also, so the special effects get better. I thought this film was better than the first and the goal of the producers should be to keep incrementally getting better with each release, reusing a core of individuals from film to film while not being afraid to kill off important characters.",1214784000,2,642,4.792792792792793
8245857,4,B0012GM6A8,"sure the films a major rip-off but i like it because it takes a whole bunch of cool ideas and puts them together. now listen people its and independent film in every since, budget, actors, script and effects. but like its predecessor its a supprisingly good film.

The Galactic Marines are back. This time the mission takes place on Mezzo, an ice world similar to Hoth from star wars. They must defeat a cyborg plant and possibly meet a Ma'har, which cant be good.",1209513600,3,464,4.523809523809524
8245858,1,B0012GM6A8,"We (my friends and I) counted no less than 10 seperate movies this 'movie' ripped off.  3 of which in the first 3 minutes and 15 seconds.  (star wars, starship troopers,empire strikes back) It also stole from mechwarrior, terminator, star trek (borg), any and all movies that deal with ""grey"" sexless space aliens, dungeons & dragons (there's a beholder, but you could argue big trouble in little china as well)
i'm guessing the jackass that filmed this saw all the movies I did, took the scenes he liked and cobbled this junk.  Don't make me punch holes threw this sad plot by pointing out things like: alien bunkers made of concrete are on ice ball planets, written in english and have plywood doors.  *sigh*  Penance.  This movie serves as penance for having wronged your fellow man.  Feel remorseful about something? Watch this, suffer, and atone for your sin.  That's why this awful movie exists... to realign your karma.",1207353600,2,926,4.8164556962025316
