Let's be clear, this is not ""animated porn stuff"" simply because it's about a BoyxBoy relationship.  And now that we're all up to speed, I'll continue with the review.

I will honestly admit that I, myself, and not entirely comfortable of the topic of BoyxBoy relationships.  That is part of the reason I was drawn to this anime.  The other part was all of the great loyality I saw towards the series from others.

Though this anime series is romantic in nature, the creators spared none of the humor.  Every episode has something you can laugh at.  Sometimes it's Shuichi's goofy naivete and sometimes it's the hilarious situations.  It's also fun to see that the typical laughter-provoking American stereotypes are alive and well in Mr. K, the manager and my personal favorite.

Understanding that this series revolves around Shuichi as a rising star in the music business, I would have been very surprised if the music had not been amazing.  From Bad Luck's own song to the background music, this is definitely a soundtrack I would/am looking into buying.

The series itself deals with several different issues, not just the relationship, though that is the main issue.  Often, after a bout of cold-shoulder from Yuki, Shuichi questions ""Is it because I'm a guy?""  The relationship between Shuichi and Yuki develops with the episodes.  There are hard spots, and sweet spots, and spots where it seems there is no relationship at all.

Other issues include Shuichi realizing that he doesn't always have to live in the shadow of his idol, Ryuichi.  He has the potential to succeed and surpass if he wants it.

The Voices:  Unforunately, I cannot comment on the English voices, as I have not yet heard them.  The Japanese voices are outstanding though.  I would highly recommend watching the Japanese(with subtitles if you need them) when you watch this series.  On the subject of english voices though, I would like to say that ADV Films, who dubbed this series, usually does very satisfactory work.  (Sidenote: If you watch the original Japanese of both Gravitation and Inuyasha, have you noticed that the voice actor for Ryuichi and Inuyasha is the same? ^_^)

I would recommend this anime to anyone.  Especially those who are still slightly uncomfortable with the topic of BoyxBoy relationships.  This series was extremely well done and the themes and topics were extremely well executed.

5/5 for Gravitation.",1108080000,8,2471,4.963414634146342
8033197,5,B0002VKZXE,"Gravitation on the whole is an excellent anime. It is an emotional rollercoaster in the relationship of Vocalist Shuichi Shindou and Novelist Eiri Yuki. One moment they are together then the next they are torn apart. The final episode explains alot about Eiri Yuki's past that is hidden which helps viewers understand his coldness to Shuichi.

Many say that opposits attract and these two fit that bill to a 'T', Eiri is cold, insulting and a loner. Shuichi is aloff, childish and annoying at times. Both are talented in their own aspects. Eiri captures others with his novels and Shuichi with his voice. One high point of the anime is the music. I love listening to the songs that they have on here. They add a touch of realisim to the anime.

I would recommend this anime to everyone. It is beautifully drawn and has an excellent script. It is well dubbed and the voices fit the personalities. I was skeptic at first but was very pleased with the quailty put into the whole thing.",1104537600,5,982,4.605714285714286
8033198,5,B0002VKZXE,"That not alot of people have reviewed this, I mean! It's been out awhile! And I absolutely LOVED this whole series. The story of a love between a rock star, Shuichi Shindou and novelist, Eiri Yuki. LOVED IT!",1103500800,3,207,4.473684210526316
8033199,5,B0002VKZXE,"I used to think of the homosexual relationships as a disgusting things but not after I saw Yuki and Shuichi. Eiri Yuki is one of the most handsome male characters I have ever seen and he is definitely hot and sexy. It all started in a weird way. I mean with just a brief meeting, fire sparkled between the two of them. I got excited when Yuki kissed Shuichi for the first time in the elevator. I was expecting more kisses afterward but there was only few. They didn't even share the bed or is that it wasn't shown in the anime? If I was in Shuichi's place, I would have definitely lose my mind. One of my favourite scenes is when Ayaka was in Yuki's apartment. It is obvious that she is in love with him but he doesn't feel the same about her. The question is, is Yuki and Shuichi gays or are they bisexuals? Because I have noticed that Yuki is dating women and Shuichi was about to date someone before he met Yuki. I didn't like the last volume much because there was nothing exciting about it and their relationship didn't take a new turn except that Yuki has confided in Shuichi about his painful past. If it is love, then Yuki is not showing anything. Now I have the four volumes and I am waiting for the OVA series to be released. I think there are 2 OVA episodes, which has been licensed in US lately. I usually choose to watch the anime in English language rather than Japanese with English Subtitles. I know that some of the voices are not that good in English but I prefer it in English anyway.
