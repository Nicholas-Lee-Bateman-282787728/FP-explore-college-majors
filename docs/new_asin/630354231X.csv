683585,5,630354231X,"In this uniquely crafted ""costume"" drama -- one of the first-ever such dramas to be aired on PBS's ""Masterpiece Theater,"" Glenda Jackson revives the enigmatic Elizabeth R, daughter  of Henry the VIII -- a dynamically hard-headed woman of incomparable wit,  vigor, shrewdness;  shifting loyalties, forbearance, and deeply felt, but  measured, compassion.
Those well-versed in the history of the Tudor  lineage will be genuinely impressed by this drama's scope and historical  accuracy.  It is of the most intelligent conception, fully faithful to the  fine-print of the texts, and supremely acted.
""Shadow in the  Sun"" (Episode III) won Jackson an Emmy, but not a single episode in  this six-segment series falls short of its numerous accolades.  Jackson is  as surefooted in the garb of a Queen as we are riveted by her every word  and gesture.
Viewers of Elizabeth R will be:
*charmed and intrigued  by an amorous handful of the Queen's ""favorites"" at court, one of  whom is Lord Robert Dudley -- the man she will later make ""Earl of  Leicester"";
*exposed to the less enviable side of  being Monarch,  as the Queen weighs the political vs. moral implications of sentencing her  cousin, the traitorous Mary of Scotland, to death;  and in doing so,  ponders the meaning of her own lifelong mission and mortality;
*mesmerized as Elizabeth courageously and vivaciously embarks on the  final phase of the Tudor reign.  Reenactment of the Queen's final hours in  Episode VI (""Sweet England's Pride"") is commanding in force and  not to be missed.  The death vigil defies our expectations, but is oh-so  stunningly executed.",934329600,15,1617,5.119230769230769
683586,5,630354231X,"Glenda Jackson gives a riveting, tour-de-performance as Queen Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch. From Elizabeth's chaotic, terrifying childhood and adolescence (when she was imprisoned for the unsupported charge of treason)  to her ascension to the throne of England and her 45 year reign through the  most fascinating and treacherous of times, we see Glenda Jackson capture  the very essence of Elizabeth's fears, indecisiveness, courage,  statesmenship, and ""larger-than-life"" personality. A woman who  gave her name to an age and and an actress who gave a visual banquet of  it!!",931910400,,584,5.50561797752809
683587,4,630354231X,"This BBC production, starring Glenda Jackson in a justly famous performance, takes full advantage of the breadth offered by the mini-series format by following Queen Elizabeth I from her youth to death. It moves  gradually from a concentration on her personal life (such as her early  romance with the Earl of Leicester) to an increasing emphasis on the  politics of the time. As it does so, Elizabeth leaves center-stage to allow  other characters, particularly her ministers, to take the most decisive  political actions. Viewers familiar with the recent film  ""Elizabeth"" may be disappointed or heartened, depending on taste,  on the relative neglect of Elizabeth's personal life in favor of her  developing political acumen. This is not a program for people seeking to  ""identify"" with the Queen's problems. Rather, by foregrounding Elizabeth's  talents against the nearly as great abilities of the people around her, the  series demonstrates how truly remarkable a woman and politician the Queen  was.
Originally aired on PBS's ""Masterpiece Theater"" series, the program  was, along with other early MT offerings like ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII""  and ""I, Claudius"" initially praised for the sumptuousness of its settings  and technical brilliance. Those aspects hold up far less well than the  acting and writing, however. More than twenty-five years of intervening  television technology have trained us to expect much more visually than  these television studio-bound productions can deliver. While the costuming  is handsome, for example, the over-bright lighting required by 1970s  videotape does not do it justice. The lighting also shows the sketchy sets  in considerably greater detail than was probably ever expected. The  camera-work and editing in general are pretty-much paint-by-the-numbers,  and particularly awkward whenever the story shifts outdoors and the medium  switches to (16mm?) film. The directing, in all respects other than the  work with the actors, is at best serviceable.
Then again, you don't watch  films or plays like this and expect great cinema. The purpose is to allow  the writers and actors to show-off. There's no doubt that at this level,  the program excels. Apart from Jackson's central performance, there are  dozens of character parts that fully exploit the resources of the British  acting tradition. And with the example of Shakespeare and Marlowe always  hovering over their heads, the writers of the series (there was a separate  writer for each of the six epidsodes) have more than shown themselves  worthy of comparison. They provide the actors not only a rich array of  characters, but the embroidered, stylized language we inevitably associate  with the period. (A quality notably lacking in ""Elizabeth,"" for  example.)
In short, this program provides more than enough to hold the  attention of anyone interested in Queen Elizabeth, and at its best moments,  the series truly shines.",927504000,31,2939,5.392070484581498

683664,5,630354231X,"As far as I'm concerned, this is The definitive video story of Elizabeth I. Glenda Jackson is simply The Queen. The fact that this version is accurate is another big plus. I loved hearing Elizabeth's actual words. (Although she actually said ""This is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes."" in Latin, not in English. A minor quibble, and the audience mostly wouldn't have understood the Latin.) I suppose some will say that the series looks more like a play than a movie, but that is just due to the fact that this version was done in the 1970's. I liked the Cate Blanchett movies, and also the Helen Mirren series (other than her meeting Mary Queen of Scots--puh-leeze--soooo never happened). Both actresses gave incredible performances and are well-worth viewing. And for those who can stomach the 1936 film Mary of Scotland, starring Katherine Hepburn as the foolish and doomed Mary, Florence Eldridge's Elizabeth I is a hoot. She did a good job, but reminded me of the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland. Anyway,  Elizabeth R  series of DVDs was a little pricey, but well worth the money and well worth the time to view it. Highly recommended for fans of this remarkable queen.",1477699200,8,1190,4.716346153846154

683701,5,630354231X,"Was it really 1971?  I remember watching this when it originally aired, and I remember being astounded with Glenda Jackson's performance.  I have always thought of her as ""the"" Elizabeth.  I pondered several times purchasing the series and always thought it would be a disappointment.  Surely it wasn't as good as I remembered it, and besides, I was quite young then and maybe my experience with movie criticism was not well developed.  And then here in 2015, I finally purchased and thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Glenda Jackson is still ""the"" Elizabeth (although Florence Eldridge in the 1936 version of Mary of Scotland certainly was terrific in a small role).  I was a bit disturbed by the dreadful makeup employed to make her look older.  I'm sure it did not look as fake and plastered when seen on the 1971 broadcast television receivers.  Sometimes modern technology gives up too much information.  Still, that woman could act.

A big surprised was how short the series was.  540 minutes seemed to fly by, although I did watch it in installments.",1451347200,2,1055,4.898305084745763

683749,5,630354231X,"And I mean Glenda Jackson. Neither Helen Mirren nor Cate Blanchett have given such in-depth portraits of Elizabeth I. This is no reflection on these actresses, rather just inadequate scripts. Jackson's performance can be called a tour de force. She has six episodes to develop Elizabeth from a frightened teenager to the most powerful woman in Europe--the Gloriana of the poets. Was she really the Virgin Queen? We are led to think so, as Elizabeth exhibits a pathological aversion to marriage. Why not, when her father Henry VIII's marriages ended so badly. Elizabeth herself was imprisoned by her half-sister Mary I, of Bloody fame. Her narrow escape from the axe left her with no aversion to executing those who threatened her life or throne. The episode dealing with the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots is absorbing. Protestant Elizabeth and Catholic Mary act out the ongoing conflict between the old and new religions and the dynastic struggle. At a time when women were considered unfit to rule, Elizabeth never doubts her divine right to dominate the men in her life, giving her name to an age.",1431993600,,1103,4.935483870967742

683819,5,630354231X,"The best show about the Virgin Queen yet made. It's more than forty years old now, and it's still better than anything made since. The show of course suffers from the tiny budget available for British television in those days, so it's almost all shot on a sound stage. If you can live with that and haven't seen Elizabeth R, you're in for a treat. Standing alone or as a sequel to Six Wives of Henry VIII it's history at its best. Glenda Jackson becomes Elizabeth, and her supporting cast is equally outstanding. From her ascencion at 25 to her death at 69, every important phase of the great queen's life is portrayed here. Her constant juggling of suitors, knowing that if she married a foreign king she would be relegated to second place, yet more concerned about her country's welfare than her own power. Putting off marrying the man she truly loves, yet insanely jealous when he tires of waiting for her and marries someone else.

Also part of the well-told story is the role played by Philip II of Spain, husband of Elizabeth's older sister Mary I, suitor to Elizabeth herself, and finally the force behind the Armada and the attempted invasion of England. The fleet and the battles are far beyond the meager budget allowed, so the battles are relayed by third-person narrators. Fortunately they are relayed so well that what happened is far more understandable to the viewer than the much more expensive graphics of more recent movies, which looked great but made no sense at all.

Elizabeth R is more than worth the money. If you are interested in the period at all then it, like its companion piece, is a must-have.",1416700800,5,1624,4.655052264808362

683976,3,630354231X,"The British just don't seem to be able to cast characters very well.  Either they don't have any actors or actresses that fit the roles or they just throw in anybody.  Surely they could have found someone better for Elizabeth and Tom Seymore. Elizabeth was said to have had a beautiful complexion.  But here she is with so much paste makeup on the face to hide the acne scars that even at what was supposed to be a very young girl she looks 50.  It just distracts from the whole thing.  They should have hired a young actress to play Elizabeth as a young girl if they were determined to go with Jackson for the role.

684081,5,630354231X,"If you want to see a good movie about Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth 1, do NOT fall into the crap trap of the newly made Hollywood abomination films about her! This is the ONLY film about Her that captures the most from history, accurately, and with performance unmatched by today's actors in my opinion. The only other film that even comes close is Helen Mirren's version, but it leaves out a lot of history, as it takes place in her later years. Elizabeth R tries to capture everything it can, from King Edward, to Mary, to Queen Elizabeth 1 coronation to Her death. It's a wonderful trip.

Does this epic film look flashy and gaudy like Hollywood likes to produce? No... thank goodness! In fact, I believe that the quality of this film (sort of stage like) actually adds to its realism! Personally, I'm sick and tired of all the computer graphic, sex lies videotape BS coming out of Hollywood these days... especially when it comes to historical icons such as Her Majesty! If She were alive today..... heads would roll...

Is it's film quality up to today's standards? Not exactly but the story, actors, and overall feel of this movie FAR outweigh these minor issues. Again, I feel this is a very positive attribute to this film!

Does this movie capture all historical facts? Of course not. In order to do that you'd have to make a year long series and so far, every time Hollywood tries to do this, they screw it up with 21st century sex and BS soap opera crap. This movie gives you a very good idea and insight into what her life and reign were probably like.

 Among those of us who actually study Her Majesty (and love her), there is no movie made in the last 30 years that captures Bess more accurately than this one. I WISH.... oh.... how I WISH... that someone would take the script from this movie, expound on it to include more detail on other historical facts, LEAVE SEX OUT and KEEP Renaissance MORALS, and have QUALITY actors like Elizabeth R had in it, and make an EPIC 1 year long saga... I would pay HUGE to see Elizabeth R redone in this way, and keep its spirit! Sadly, I do not believe there are any Directors or actors alive today, or writers for that matter, who could do this... it would be too hard, they are too 21st century in mind and spirit, and they would probably want to throw sex sex sex in it mixed with soap opera fantasy... and ruin it.

Anyway, if you want the BEST movie about Her, this is it! And will probably be the only one...

The world has missed Her, and I think in silent mourning for Her, for 500 years - and for good reason. However, at least we have good books, good documentaries, and films such as Elizabeth R to help us relate to a time when things were simpler, people were honorable, and leaders were leaders and wanted nothing more but the best for their people. Perhaps this is what we miss... what we desire most of all.... and why we miss her so... 500 years later...",1391558400,4,2924,4.4037037037037035

684270,5,630354231X,"In 1971, Glenda Jackson, fresh off an Oscar win for Women In Love took up BBC television to play the great queen Elizabeth I.  She also played the part in a movie, Mary, Queen of Scots, about the queen's rival monarch.  The show was similar to 1970s The Six Wives of Henry VIII.  It was divided into 6 hour and half plays that focused on Elizabeth's life.  The show was videotaped which had been around for a long time but was now only coming into being as a viable easy option for television shows.  Videotape had now become sophisticated enough to allow editing and retouching on sound and photography.  That made videotape a cheap and better option for television than it had been especially for primetime shows.  With the creation of Public Broadcasting, BBC shows found a path to America that hadn't been there before.  For a certain audience, miniseries like Elizabeth I were a godsend and quite enjoyable to watch.  Glenda Jackson does a wonderful job along with her other actors, writers, directors and producers in creating an accurate and entertaining portrait of Elizabeth I.  It covers her life from her attempt at survival during her brother, Edward VI's reign and that of Mary Tudor who attempted to bring the Catholic Church back into prominence and horrifying the English people by marrying Philip I of Spain.  When she became queen for 44 years, she brought peace and prosperity to the kingdom that it had never experienced before.  Near the end of it, she defeated the Spanish Armanda and put England on the path to being ""King of the Seas"".  She successfully led the kingdom often by delaying decisions or not making them at all and waiting for a crisis to lift.  She let her enemies destroy each other or fight demising them both.  A great ruler and a great series portraying her greatness.  The extras on this set of DVDs are worthwhile.  Commentary by Alison Weir allows the viewer to re-watch the series with historical background.  The interview of Glenda Jackson is very interesting.  She learned a lot about Elizabeth I when making the series, discussed the making of the production and since she has been a Member of Parliament since 1989, had learned about government and England's history of government.  She also needed to learn how be in government.  Great interview that few people could discuss from those points of view.  A documentary from A&E from 1996 about Elizabeth I am strange in that it is critical of Elizabeth as a ruler who didn't do anything and that Shakespeare wrote his best plays under James I, ignoring that the peace and prosperity that Elizabeth I brought didn't set the pathway for that.

684276,5,630354231X,"Before Ben Kingsley as Gandhi or Denzel Washington as Malcolm X, Glenda Jackson walked in the shoes of Queen Elizabeth I in 1971. Or, better stated, Jackson, along with her cast, crew, and the BBC, transported television audiences to another era, another time when chivalry still existed, religion and politics were intertwined, and the world was lit only by fire. However, many of the old Medieval sensibilities were being displaced by an enthusiasm for discovery, science, culture, arts, and tolerance that we now call the Renaissance, and Queen Elizabeth I was the central figure in England's contribution to this rebirth of culture. Jackson's performance and unparalleled historical scholarship bring the era back to life and have ensured Elizabeth R's ranking as one of the great screen biographies.

In addition to the superlative performance by Jackson, the entire production conveys the atmosphere of mid-to-late 1500's England. Former Hollywood offerings of the same subject, particularly the ones starring Betty Davis, had a fairy-tale ambiance that made the era seem more otherworldly rather than historical. By contrast, the 1971 BBC production brings the viewer right into the middle of 1500's England as if you are walking around the halls and chambers with the personages from the 16th century. Instead of seeing the monarch upon a distant throne in a palace hall, the viewer feels adjacent to these people, many of whom have become almost iconic. Conversations with the likes of William Cecil (Lord Burghley), Queen Mary I, Philip II of Spain, and of course Queen Elizabeth I herself are at a human level rather than at a distance. This intimacy creates a reality that fosters a closeness with the era, although these people lived 400 to 450 years before our present time. In short, we better appreciate that these people lived and breathed, loved and hated, wept and rejoiced, much as we do now. There is something about the whole production that feels like a Shakespeare play, which seems most appropriate.

Queen Elizabeth I of England, the last monarch before the isles became known as Great Britain, was a pivotal figure who understood that a new era was dawning. In addition to the debts and deficits, her country was being torn apart by its own Reformation when Henry VIII split from the Roman Catholic Church to form the Church of England. His religious revolution, which not only resulted from Rome's refusal to consent to his divorce of Catherine of Aragon but because of the protestant waves that were influencing his people, dissolved almost overnight when his daughter Mary I became queen and briefly reinstated the Catholic Church. And she had a bad habit of burning people who did not convert back to the old religion.

Queen Elizabeth I re-established, with the consent of Parliament, The Church of England and brought a certain amount of religious toleration uncommon in her era. Although she was still quite distrustful of ""Papists"", those still loyal to the Pope in Rome, far fewer saw similar fates as the Protestants during the reign of her half-sister. In fact, when compared with other European monarchs of the time, Queen Elizabeth I sanctioned far fewer executions. She encouraged trade, the arts, particularly the performing arts. The late 1500's until the early 1600's is regarded as England's Golden Age of theatre with the likes of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Johnson. And scholarship, as in Italy a hundred years earlier, became an all-important aspect of Elizabethan life personified by the works Francis Bacon. And of course it was an age of geographical discovery as attested by Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh.

Simultaneously, court intrigue was also an on-going quandary. From the moment of her crowning, Rome issued a death-warrant for her, and those loyal to Rome were persistently plotting to overthrow her. Despite her reputation for mercy, traitors whose mission was to assassinate the Protestant queen in the name of bringing the Roman Church back to England would endure a fate worse than death if arrested. Her most controversial act, the execution of her cousin Mary Queen of Scots, was not without cause. Recent evidence suggests that the queen of Scotland knowingly may have been involved in plots to overthrow England's monarch. Biographies written prior to the 1990's have often characterized the Queen of Scotland as an innocent victim.

Queen Elizabeth I has literally become the symbol of all that is superior in English culture. The BBC production Elizabeth R is a living testament to that symbol. Her reign has become ever-associated with one of the greatest ages in all of humankind, and, using a camera lens, Elizabeth R brings this age into closer focus for better viewing and scrutiny. The Elizabethan Age is still 400 years away from us and getting farther, but at least Elizabeth R brings us back there for a moment.",1343952000,3,4899,5.095890410958904

Glenda Jackson recieved the most kudos for acting, but most of the characters were well presented by fine actors and actresses.

684401,5,630354231X,"A strong actress who can capture an audience and convince them into believing she is truly is Queen Elizabeth was needed for this film, and Glenda Jackson has done it to perfection. She fits the roll so well, I found myself wondering if she was born just to play the part. Not only does she have the exact appearance for the roll, she portrays the Queen demeanor flawlessly as well.

This film series follows the life of Queen Elizabeth, from her youth prior to being crowned Queen, to her death after sitting on the throne for 44 years. From her love life (or lack there of) to the constant life and death battles between the Catholics and Protestants, Glenda Jackson's portrayal of the Queen is so well done, one almost feels as though they know her.

The Queens character ages through out the series. As you watch the physical appearance of Queen Elizabeth grow older, you also see how her personality changes with it. A subtle charge that makes the character seem all the more real to audiences.

By the final film in this series, you feel as though you know and understand Queen Elizabeth and her choices. You feel pity for her never marrying her one true love. You see how the killing of her mother played a roll in every one of her life's decisions. You understand how even being royalty, she was always left watching her back. And you see just how many close calls she had in her lifetime which could have prevented her from being crowned Queen.

This is the portrayal of Elizabeth that inspired me to learn more about her, the time that she lived in, and the people around her.  In truth, no television or series of plays can really accurately show what a marvel this woman truly was, and the things that she must have had to endure.  But this comes pretty close to what I imagine reality must have been.

The costuming department deserves an award for this work, as it's historically spot-on, and beautiful.  Some of the creations, while I'm sure were awkward to wear, were so gorgeous that I actually wanted to look into recreation of them!  The makeup crew also did a wonderful job, especially with Glenda Jackson toward the end of the series.  Not that easy to make someone go from 15 to nearly 70!  Admittedly, the sets were sparse - if only the BBC had had more money to pour into it - but maybe this wasn't a detraction.  I can't imagine that the royal residences in the 1500's were more lavish than what you see here, to be honest.

As for the acting - I've heard complaints that Glenda Jackson was ""too stern"", but you must keep in mind that she was portraying a woman that couldn't afford to SHOW tenderness or softer emotions.  For Elizabeth to do so would have meant that her enemies would use that weakness against her!  The scene with Sussex where she broke down and admitted that she would never marry, that was a pivotal scene, and probably the softest-hearted that you will see this character.  If you're expecting tender emotions from Elizabeth I, that is not how she was in real life - and as such, this is an extremely accurate depiction of her.  Some of the actors in this were thoroughly enjoyable!  I loved Robert Hardy's depiction of Dudley - he was smarmy, calculating...and completely smitten with Elizabeth.  The chemistry between Jackson and Hardy was more than obvious, and it's a real shame that Elizabeth and Dudley weren't allowed to marry, because I think that they were truly ""in love"".

I enjoyed all six episodes, although I admit that the second (The Marriage Game) and third (Shadow in the Sun) were my favorites.  By the sixth episode, it was a lot less about Elizabeth and more about the Irish uprising, which admittedly isn't my focus of interest.  I do believe that they took some liberties with Elizabeth's words and what was actually said, but all in all I think they did a really good job with accurate portrayal.

This series is worth seeing if you have any interest in Elizabeth, Elizabethan times, or the history of British royalty.",1305936000,3,2586,4.629385964912281

684408,5,630354231X,"This is most likely the seminal piece of work that thoroughly portrays the life of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth I.  Although none of alive knows what Elizabeth sounded like, acted like, or even looked like (other than from paintings that may or may not have been accurate), Glenda Jackson is Queen Elizabeth.  Her portrayal of the Monarch in Mary Queen of Scots is also incredible.  (It is nearly impossible to distinguish between her in either work because they were shot at about the same time, unless one actually views the work for a while.)

Because the work (as opposed to Mary, Queen of Scots) was filmed for television, the sets are a bit dry.  Also, as it is supposed to be, it comes off as a theater piece, i.e., as a play.  The costumes are excellent, and the acting just cannot get better.

The ""bonus features"" are also very interesting.  The A&E Biography of Glenda Jackson was excellent.  I had not realized that she had become a Member of Parliament in the 1990s, and I believe she still remains an MP.

684578,2,630354231X,"It's good TV but it's only TV, and the best of TV is still not as good as a book or a movie, so don't buy this with hopes of anything worth your time.

It's good TV because they did tons of research to make the scenes accurate. So you could learn by watching it. But if you want to learn, you would do better to get a book. You could get 100 times as much information, plus analysis, and besides you wouldn't have to endure the annoying interludes of flute music!

It's good TV because they tried to tell a long coherent story instead of the usual 19 minutes of low-attention-span garbage. But if you want a coherent story, you would do better to see a movie. This is because movies have Directors. They deal with camera angles, cinematography, and pace. TV producers don't have time for that sort of subtlety, so they just stick a bunch of actors in front of a camera and go through scene.. after scene.. after scene.. after scene. Where a well-directed movie has a sense of increasing or decreasing tension, plot, or resolution, a miniseries just goes on .. and on .. and on.

As multiple reviewers point out, the production values are appalling: cheap sets badly lit,  interspersed with long-range blurry shots of somebody-on-a-horse.  I don't really care: if they had good acting or writing, it would be fine. Monty Python's Flying Circus was filmed with the same sort of budget, and it's great stuff. (Actually one distraction with the Elizabeth series is the constant suspicion that at any moment they are about to burst into the Lumberjack Song).

As for acting - - The character of Mary in the first instalment was impressive. The rest of them are just a bunch of people standing around reading lines. When Mary shows up and really looks like a person with inner life and emotions, it is a remarkable contrast. Many reviewers have commented that Glenda Jackson's acting seems ""too stern"".  Actually she has three modes.
1. Act stern
2. Suddenly burst into maniacal laughter
3. Suddenly shout at people, thus showing your Awesome Personal Power
No character, though - just three modes. Most college drama club actors could do it. And maybe yall look down your noses at the Cate Blanchett version, but Cate showed more character and presence in the first three seconds where the camera slowly brings her into focus, than Glenda manages in hour after dreary hour.

No review would be complete without mentioning the poor writing of episode 1. It opens with five minutes of completely indecipherable reference to the nobleman who kept visiting the adolescent Elizabeth in her bedroom. I forget his name - the one who ended up with his head chopped off? Anyway, maybe British kids are all brought up knowing all this stuff by heart, so all you have to do is show a guy acting foppish and a girl in a nightgown, and everybody knows the rest of the story. But if you didn't know the story, you would be completely unable to figure out what the heck they were talking about. The rest of episode 1 has the same defect. If you don't know the lives of Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, and their various mothers, you will never learn it from the incoherent and hasty scenes that litter the entire episode. And that is a key indicator of bad writing. Even if you do already know the whole history, bad writing is still bad writing.",1232582400,8,3322,4.599662162162162

684729,4,630354231X,"The ""Elizabeth R."" series was completed well before my time (in fact, my mother was just in her second year of college when it came out!), but I've always enjoyed a good Elizabethan drama, so I figured this would be a wonderful addition to my collection.

Having completed all 6 episodes, I can say without equivocation that Glenda Jackson's 'Good Queen Bess' is THE standard to which all others will be compared. I truly thought Helen Mirren's light and shade performance in HBO's ""Elizabeth"" was clearly the best representation, until I saw Ms. Jackson's characterization. Her thunderous ""God's death!"" puts a smile on my face because I imagine that is how QEI would've sounded.

On the basis of the acting (heck, just Glenda Jackson alone), this deserves the 5-star treatment, but I do take issue with the lack of respect this venerable series has gotten from Masterpiece Theater and the BBC. The lighting, the noticeable differences between video and film (the shots inside versus the shots outside), and in particular the sets, all leave much to be desired. I understand the workings of a shoestring budget in the 70's, but restoration would at least enhance the color and texture. The very same BBC did it for ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII,"" so it stands to reason that it could be done for ""Elizabeth R.""

Based upon Glenda Jackson, fine costuming (the attention to detail was very fine), a strong supporting cast, I give it 5-stars, but due to limited technology, poor lighting and sets, I must take away a star.

684949,5,630354231X,"This series of six 90 minute episodes helped put Masterpiece Theatre on the map back in the early 1970's and starred a very young Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth. The acting is outstanding, and the series has the vast majority of the historical details down correctly. However, you are going to have to accustom yourself to the rather crude looking lighting and camera work that was typical of PBS production values of the early 1970's. In fact, unless there is some copyright problem at work I am unaware of, that is likely why I have not seen it on TV in 15 years. The series takes Elizabeth from shortly after the death of her father, King Henry VIII, in 1547, up to her own deathbed in 1603. The following is a brief description of each of the six episodes:

1. The Lion's Cub - The series begins in 1547 with the brief six-year reign of Elizabeth's sickly younger brother, Edward VI. Manipulated by his Seymour uncles, he prefers to debate religion with Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. His untimely death is followed by the nine day reign of the usurper, Lady Jane Grey. The people refuse to allow the true succession to be supplanted and rise up in the name of Edward's oldest sister, Mary, who ascends the throne. The majority of the episode deals with Mary's attempts to convert Elizabeth to the Catholic faith. Various plots and rebellions flare, and Elizabeth spends some time under arrest in the Tower of London. She is released when Mary weds the Spanish king, Phillip II. The marriage is not a success, and the pitiful Mary dies childless, leaving only one heir to the throne, her sister Elizabeth.

2. The Marriage Game - In 1558, the marriage of the new queen is the most pressing political issue of the new reign, as it is imperative that Elizabeth produce an heir. Foreign princes negotiate for her hand, but Elizabeth refuses to commit to any one of them. Meanwhile, her friendship with Sir Robert Dudley deepens, causing unease among her councillors. Dudley's wife dies by a mysterious fall down a flight of stairs, and all of Europe believes the English queen engineered the tragedy. An attack of smallpox brings the queen near death, and her council laments that there is no viable heir to the throne. Elizabeth recovers, but her problem remains: if she remains childless, who will succeed her?

3. Shadow in the Sun - The episode opens as Elizabeth and her court react to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which hundreds of French Huguenots (Protestants) died at the hands of the French king's troops. Ever the pragmatist, Elizabeth is willing to set aside her horror and open marriage negotiations with the French king's younger brother, the Duke of Alencon. A tender romance develops between the aging queen and the younger, impish Duke. Behind the scenes, Elizabeth's councillors Cecil, Sussex, and Walsingham bargain with the Duke's mother, the formidable Catherine de Medici. The queen undergoes an awkward physical examination to prove she can still bear children, while her favorite Dudley, now the Earl of Leicester, attempts to sabotage the marital plans. As the queen vacillates, Alencon drops a bombshell: Leicester has secretly married Elizabeth's cousin, the Countess of Essex. In the end, the queen cannot bring herself to marry. She bids farewell to her last chance at personal happiness, and her last chance of bearing children, and reveals her melancholy by composing a poem, ""A Shadow in the Sun.""

4. Horrible Conspiracies - In the mid 1580's attention turns to Elizabeth's closest relative and greatest enemy, Mary, Queen of Scots. Imprisoned by Elizabeth for many years, Mary is a focal point for Catholic unrest in England. Walsingham is concerned for Elizabeth's security but knows that the queen will never consent to Mary's execution without incontrovertible proof of her treachery. He engineers a meeting between the Scottish queen and Sir Anthony Babington, a leading Catholic aristocrat. A plot develops to overthrow Elizabeth and seize the throne, a plot followed step by step by Walsingham. Its revelation leads to Queen Mary's trial and conviction, but Elizabeth cannot bring herself to order the execution of an anointed queen. Ultimately, she signs the death warrant, only to disavow it later. But her recantation is too late; the Queen of Scots is executed.

5. The Enterprise of England - The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, at the order of Queen Elizabeth, shocks Europe, and encourages King Phillip of Spain to prepare to invade England in 1588. At Elizabeth's direction, Sir Francis Drake wages small piracies upon Spanish ships, which does nothing to deter Phillip's assembly of the mighty Spanish Armada. At the English court, debate rages over attempts to negotiate peace, while at the Spanish court, the king is urged to delay. Phillip, moved by God, launches his fleet, and Elizabeth, against the advice of her new favorite Essex, joins her troops to await the invasion. Though vastly outnumbered, the English fleet, with smaller, swifter ships, out-maneuvers the larger Spanish galleons. A terrible storm finishes the job: the Armada is defeated. Back in London, Elizabeth is in the mood to celebrate, until sad news reaches the court: the queen's one true love, the Earl of Leicester, has died.

6. Sweet England's Pride - At the end of her life, Elizabeth is a parody of her former glory. The ancient queen tolerates the insufferable egotism of her young favorite, the Earl of Essex, to the chagrin of Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Robert Cecil. Egged on by sycophantic friends and his mother Lady Leicester, Essex believes he can supplant Elizabeth and rule in her place. His hubris leads to his downfall, and he is arrested and executed. Elizabeth has outlived all her contemporaries, and with the son of her enemy Mary, Queen of Scots poised to inherit her throne, she takes her last breath.

If you don't know much about Queen Elizabeth before watching this series, spend a little time reading brief sketches on her father Henry VIII and her mother Ann Boleyn. Also, be sure to read about Elizabeth's younger brother Edward and older sister Mary, both of whom who preceeded her as England's King and Queen, respectively. Their biographies figure heavily into Elizabeth's reasonings and the choices she made, but there is not much detail given about their lives in this series. Much has been made recently about the 4 hour drama ""Elizabeth I"" starring Helen Mirren made just last year. That is definitely a good program on the subject, but this one is much better, since it shows the entirety of Elizabeth's adult life. Also, although Helen Mirren did a wonderful job, she doesn't seem to age a day over the length of the series even though over 20 years pass. Glenda Jackson's Elizabeth has you believing you are watching the queen mature from a giggling teenager to the 69 year old monarch she was at her death.

Her prowess is undeniable and unforgettable. She gets the importance of Elizabeth's fierce intellect, and it makes every moment spent with her transparent, heightened by using Elizabeth's own words and expression. I can't think of another portrayal of Elizabeth that comes close. The film conveys mediaeval court coarseness with confidence and beauty, and it pulses with Jackson's genius beginning to end. In the presence of her Elizabeth, you're pulled way beyond acting; a coruscating diversion, and one here recommended. Each episode's script surpasses the perfect one previous, one of the film's best features. Perennial BBC production values are front and center, and the cast is crackling. Robert Hardy takes an oddly unsettling turn as Dudley, but truth is, Glenda Jackson ignites and nothing else matters. It's a tour de force full of rewards.

The setting is England in the 1550's, and King Edward rules the realm having succeeded his father King Henry VIII.  Nevertheless, his health problems will lead to his untimely death and the ascension of Queen Mary to the throne in 1553, only to be followed by Queen Elizabeth in 1558; the rest is pretty much History...

Glenda Jackson, Ronald Hines, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The clash between England and her adversaries (notably France and Spain) is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism.

In addition, the series does a GREAT job of presenting both the queen and the woman in Elizabeth.

The only setback is that Elizabeth R does not provide that much of a balanced examination; it is quite biased against Queen Mary (Elizabeth's half sister), and Mary, Queen of Scots (her cousin), both of whom are presented rather negatively.

685032,5,630354231X,"Let it be written, this is how television ought to be made. Scripted, staged and acted to the apex of success and sophistication, I have never in my life been lucky enough to see anything like the quality of Elizabeth R, the BBC's very fine 1970s miniseries chronicling the more well-known aspects of the life of Queen Elizabeth 1.

Set across a series of six two-hour plays, the story follows that of the young protestant princess Elizabeth, disowned and shut away while her catholic sister Mary takes the throne. Her subsquent release and coronation set the stage for the more eventful, treacherous and successful aspects of the rest of her reign - her failed romances, her successful campaigns, her would-be asassinations shot down - each captured so beautifully and acted so convincingly as to completely enthrall the viewer.

Glenda Jackson is magnificent, it is a rare thing indeed for any actress to be able to portray such an age range (sixteen or so to well over sixty), and, excellent makeup effects notwithstanding, to do it with such consistency and timing. Jackson's palpable skill and total immersion in such an expansive and archaic role is superlative, and sets the stage for a series of other quite brilliant performances from names like Vivian Pickles as Mary of Scotland, Stephen Murray as the bloody-minded and chauvanistic Cardinal Walsingham and the excellent Daphne Slater as the ill-fated Queen Mary 1.

With such performances to hand, the BBC could have been forgiven for staging the productions on a shoestring budget, but happily this is not the case, and historical detail abounds in the richness of the costumes, the sparseness of the Elizabethan sets and the overall sense of a moment in history not forgotten by modern researchers. Where Cate Blanchett's 'Elizabeth' (an excelletn film, too, but simply not in this league!) was flashy and lush, the contrasting sense of lush and spartan treatments of some of the visuals in 'Elizabeth R' creates such a sense of Period that it's easy to forget that this is simply a TV series.

But that's doing it an injustice. 'TV Series' conjures up images of pedantic in-jokes and convoluted continuity, neither of which 'Elizabeth R' suffers from. In terms of acting, staging and tension, it really is the ultimate in drama, and for fans of the Tudor and Elizabethan periods of history, it cannot be missed.

This series brings that period of British history to life in a brilliant and majestical way.  The costumes and scenery were exquisite and makes one long to visit England to re-visit all the places and seek out the museums to actually see the costumes, and jewels from the Elizabethan period.

Famously, Jackson refused to play Elizabeth ever as completely sympathetic and retains throughout a sourness to the character that makes her seem very lifelike.

BBC made in the 1970's including ""The Six Wives of

Henry VIII"", ""I, Claudius"" and ""Fall of Eagles"".

I highly recommend all of them.

Queen Elizabeth I was voted in 1999 the greatest

ruler of the last 1000 years.  Under her reign,

England became a major world power.  The beginnings

of the centuries-long rule of the Royal Navy on the

oceans of the world began and her role in it was

finding master seamen Sir Francis Drake and

John Hawkins to build it.  The first English

colony in North American (named Virginia after her) was

established.  She promoted a series

of able statesman such as William and Robert

Cecil who built a stable and (relatively) honest

government that cared about the welfare of the people

and not just enriching themselves.

Of course, there were many problems in her long reign.

This series shows the jealousy among many of her

courtiers, her controversial relationwhip with

Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester), the numerous

threats to her throne by various schemers,

her indecision about what to do with her cousin

Mary Stuart, the religious strife, not just

between Protestants and Catholics (who were still

the majority in her reign) but also amongst the

Protestants themselves (i.e. the Puritans against

the main Church of England) and the constant

threat of war and possibly invasion from Spain.

The series does point out flaws she had such

as her tightfistedness in not wanting to pay

the demobilized sailors who had successfully

confronted the Spanish Armada and her favoring

of the spoiled and arrogant

Earl of Essex (step-son of Dudley)

who ended up turning on her.

One slight criticism I have of the program

is in the episode ""The Enterprise of England"",

King Philip II of Spain and his commander

the Duke of Medina-Sidonia are made out to

be comical fools, and I am sure that neither

of them was that since Spain was the number 1

superpower of the world at that time.  One other

criticism I can make of Time Magazine's choice

is that I feel there was a certain amount of

""political correctness"" in their choice of

a woman as the best ruler of the last millenium

is that it (and this series) ignores the fact

that it was her policies of support to Drake

set the stage for the start of the Trans-Atlantic

Slave Trade bringing ultimately millions of

African slaves to America.  This would certainly

sully her reputation, so it is overlooked.

However, these are minor criticisms.  The series

is a joy to the senses with the beautiful, authentic

costumes and the Elizabethan music and dancing.",1108857600,5,2627,4.792325056433409

Glenda Jackson interprets and plays this woman extremely well, as an extremely capable and witty leader of a country that, 400 years ago, was far from stable.  She turns what could have been a VERY dull miniseries into a story that will keep you watching, DVD after DVD.  Her acting is quite creative and impressed me very much.  Whoever was in charge of the costumes and the set also did a terrific job.
Another plus about this set is that it includes the A&E Biography, which is excellent, and will provide some helpful background information before you watch the miniseries itself.  Before I watched these DVDs, I had no idea who Elizabeth was.  Now I want to watch them again and I'm looking for biographies.

 My favorites are the monologues, spoken with such power by Glenda Jackson, whose performance is a treasure. The cast that surrounds her is also wonderful, and often having a physical similarity to the historical character (with kudos to the make-up department).

There are so many reasons to buy this fantastic DVD package, which may seem expensive but is actually an excellent value. For historians this is a must, and anyone who appreciates great English theater will be delighted. The quality of the film is also exceptional, with an exceedingly clear picture and audio.

I bought it to prepare for a portrait of Queen Bess, and was enthralled by the detail of the costuming; what amazed me was how the fashion changed during the queen's forty-four year reign. It was a time rich with culture and style, with the emergence of Shakespeare and other great writers, and the queen loved clothes and jewelry, and surely set the trends.

The music by David Munro also adds to the atmosphere, and the sets have an authentic feel.

This is a brilliant production, and total running time is 540 minutes.

The DVD ""extras"" are terrific, are the entire content of the 4th disc, and should perhaps be viewed before the film, for full appreciation of the history. The ""extras"" are:

2: An interview with historian Alison Weir

3: ""Elizabeth I"", an A&E documentary with commentary by various authors and historians, and marvelous imagery to illustrate it.

4, A: Glenda Jackson reads documents. B: Portrait Gallery (there is an error here, where the portrait of Robert Dudley is actually one of Sir Francis Drake). C: Historical Sites, including the queen's tomb, palaces, etc.

685113,5,630354231X,"Elizabeth R is an outstanding and refreshingly accurate 1972 dramatisation of the life of Queen Elizabeth I.  Headed by an all-star British cast, the acting is flawless, the costumes magnificent, the writing first-rate, and the dialogue sumptuous.  Existing documents have been utilised for speeches and such, but the same tone or feel has been maintained throughout, resulting in a rich verbal tapestry.
The series is presented in six 90-minute episodes, and as for the quality of the DVD set, the BBC has done an exceptional job.  The picture is nice and clear, the sound is good, and the disc set is encased in a richly flocked, emerald green slip case.  Best of all, however, are the numerous special features.  Firstly there is a 30-minute interview with Glenda Jackson (2001) wherein she talks about the role and her preparation for it, about Elizabeth, and lastly about politics (she's been a Labour MP for the last decade or so).  Also informative is a 20-minute interview with historian Alison Weir (2001), wherein she talks about Elizabeth, her world, and the accuracy of the presentation.  There is a 45-minute A&E biography (1996) on the life of Elizabeth, an audio reading by Jackson of a number of period documents, behind-the-scenes' photos of Jackson in make-up and costume fitting, a portrait gallery with stills of various characters displayed beside portraits of the originals, and a text-based guide to who's who in the cast.  A wonderful feature (which I highly recommend viewers take advantage of!) is the audio commentary provided by Alison Weir, which one can turn on while watching the episodes.  Weir provides a lot of background information and other tidbits, as well as highlighting areas where liberties have been taken.
Born in 1533 to Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth was a woman of formidable intelligence who proved herself to be an extremely capable and dedicated monarch, and Glenda Jackson's portrayal of her from youth through old age is nothing short of a masterpiece.  I have seen other actresses in the role but Jackson's portrayal is and (for me) always will be the definitive one.  It is sheer perfection--one in which realism (thankfully) is not sacrificed on the altar of vanity.  Jackson went so far as to blacken her teeth to mimic the rotting teeth of the ageing Elizabeth; also, she partially shaved her head in order to better resemble the high-foreheaded Queen.
Familiar faces to fans of British television include:  Robert Hardy (All Creatures, Edward the King), who is magnificent as the dashing Robert (""Robin"") Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the life-long love of Elizabeth.  The late Michael Williams (A Fine Romance) is highly enjoyable as Elizabeth's ""Frog"", the Duke of Alencon--the only real contender for her hand.  The late Peter Jeffrey is superb as Phillip II of Spain.  Robin Ellis (Poldark) is splendid as the young, handsome, highly ambitious but petulant and self-destructive Earl of Essex, whom the Queen rather foolishly favoured--indeed doted on--in her old age.
In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone interested in history or historical biography.  Being a 70's dramatisation, it may not have the slick production values of more recent endeavours (ie. it feels at times as though we are watching a play that's been filmed), but don't let that deter you.  You'll have to look far to find a more authentic dramatisation or one that is better written or more consummately acted.  If you are familiar with and have enjoyed other superb historical productions of the time--shows like I Claudius or The Six Wives of Henry VIII, for example--you will surely enjoy this one!  Finally, for those interested in delving a little deeper, I highly recommend Alison Weir's well-researched, captivating book entitled The Life of Elizabeth I.",1080259200,28,3832,5.110576923076923

If you are used to the story format set up by the makers of the brilliant I, Claudius you might consider the episodes of Elizabeth R to be a little long... because they are.  You should be in the right mood before you start (or be prepared to get into the story rather quickly) otherwise you might get distracted or even a little bored.  However, if you are in the mood for a television movie each episode should deliver.
The major drawback to this DVD boxed set is the bonus features... actually one of the interviews with Glenda Jackson herself.  She takes it upon herself to turn her discussion of this miniseries into a party political broadcast on behalf of the labor party... if I would have known I was getting that nonsense I would have never bothered to listen to her drivel about former Prime Minister Thatcher.
Well, what should I have expected?  She's an actor gone politician... and the Left love political actors (unless the name is Reagan and the politics are anything to the right Karl Marx).  Best to just watch her start as youthful Bess and end as the aged Queen.",1034553600,9,1110,4.547738693467337

There were very few dresses in the series worn by Jackson that I could not name the portrait which they were based on.

685184,5,630354231X,"This Masterpiece Theatre, six play series of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England is magnificent. Written by six different playwrights, they are uniformly excellent. Glenda Jackson reigns supreme in the role of Elizabeth I.

While the production values are not high, that is because these plays were part of a televised series for which there were budgetary constraints. The shift from indoor sets to outdoor scenes is awkward, as it entails a switch from tape to film. The stage makeup is noticeable, as the lighting is harsh and glaring. Although the sets are a stark and dreary backdrop, the costumes are sumptuous and gorgeous. More important, the acting is, at all times, superlative.

Elizabeth I is played to perfection by Glenda Jackson. She has set the standard by which all others who seek to reprise this role will be judged, and she is the linchpin around which the entire six play series revolves. She begins the series playing Elizabeth as the young woman who would be queen, waiting upon the whims of her sister, the Queen Mary, and trying to survive the political intrigues and plots which surround her and threaten her very existence. The threat dissipates upon Mary's death, though it never disappears, and she becomes Queen of her beloved England.

As the series progresses, one sees her mature and resist the overtures and attentions of would be husbands, preferring, instead, to be married to England. One sees the development of her political and diplomatic acumen, as she sublimates her personal desires to become the greatest monarch, male or female, England has ever known, The Virgin Queen.

Each one of the plays has its own unique story to tell about Elizabeth and is a first rate drama that segues seamlessly into the next. The supporting cast is superb. All in all, this series provides a fully absorbing, historically accurate drama. It is through Ms. Jackson's insightful and commanding performance that one is able to understand why Elizabeth I was responsible for ushering in England's golden age.",999820800,128,2036,4.997050147492625

Several actors from Henry reprise their roles in this series (I'll leave it you to spot them all, quiz later). I beleive the BBC used the same sets as well.

685238,4,630354231X,"""Elizabeth R"" is a great masterpiece detailing Elizabeth I as an authoratarian ruler of England, greatly shaping its culture, reigning as a popular ruler. People who try to control are naive because they think she is weak due to the fact she is a woman, something that they are sorely mistaken about. Glenda Jackson takes charge of the lead role as the Virgin Queen the same way that Derek Jacobi takes charge of Claudius in ""I, Claudius,"" the series that shares, with ""Elizabeth R"", the title of greatest drama in ""Masterpiece Theatre"" history. Jackson plays a hard queen who has a great sense of duty to England and wants to change it, but for the better. Naturally, she runs into her share of adversaries and wanna-be puppeters. The queen triumphs in the end in a big way, and Jackson and the brilliant writing help the series to be a tour-de-force.

685239,5,630354231X,"Most people choose actors or popstars as their idols. I however, worship Elizabeth the First.  Her times, her personality, her strength and the challenges she faced have captivated and enthralled me for years. Having read copious amounts about this woman and arriving to my own conclusions as to the kind of person she was and the true nature of events at that time, any dramatization has me concerned that justice will be done to this hero of mine.  Unlike the recent Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett, (a nice movie, but so historically innaccurate as to be irrelevant and laughable) this BBC dramatization is about as close to the truth as you're ever going to get.  Peppered throughout with lines historically quoted by the protagonists, very few liberties are taken. In the case of a few scenes where it is possible to debate whether something happened exactly the way it is portrayed, it is a well researched and educated speculation inserted merely to help clarify the flow of events. The performances from just about all the characters involved are superb, with naturally special note going to Glenda Jackson.  It is important to remember that Elizabeth was a fiercly intelligent, political creature and a surviour too.  She was nothing like the hesitating, insecure waif played by Cate Blanchett, and Ms Jackson captures her very effectively.  There have been mentions in some of these reviews about budget restraints.  Did anyone look at the costumes?  I think these critics are referring to the lack of gloss in this production, but this only serves to make it more realistic.  And the costumes are, almost to the last detail, what is known to have been worn. If anyone wants a true introduction to Elizabeth, or wants to know what it most likely was like, then go no further.  This version, in my opinion will very likely never be surpassed and there will never be a better Elizabeth than Glenda Jackson.  All future productions I feel will be compared with this, and that is just as it should be. I'd give it 6 stars if it was possible.",984614400,14,2045,4.814285714285714

Glenda Jackson (now a British MP) presents a superb representation of Elizabeth , from a teenage princess, through her golden years as Gloriana ,and onto her autumn years. If you enjoyed the Henry VIII series,you'll no doubt be buying this anyway,but to anyone who hasn't had the pleasure, if you like historical drama,or are in anyway interested in one of the most glorious periods in English history,I can heartily recommend this classic as an essential purchase.",974505600,3,772,5.233870967741935

Now, Cate Blanchett is a very good young Elizabeth.  I think she's even  better than Glenda.  However, the bulk of Elizabeth's reign happened after  she was 30, and Glenda Jackson is magnificent as Gloriana.  The supporting  cast is equally amazing, and you can practically identify real portraits of  the characters based on the actors appearances.  This work is extremely  accurate, but doesn't lose one ounce of enjoyment because of it.
