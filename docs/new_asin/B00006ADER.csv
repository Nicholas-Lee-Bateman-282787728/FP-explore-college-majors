1736470,5,B00006ADER,"""Go Tigers"" is a fantastic, beautifully filmed and edited documentary about the most intense high school football program in the nation.  A must see for any high school football fan and those interested in the  underlying  social commentary about American youth sports programs.",1031270400,2,278,5.4186046511627906
1736471,5,B00006ADER,"""Go Tigers."" A film that follows the lives of three high school football players through an eventful season. Although there is an exciting football story line, the main focus is on the people in the town of Massillon.
Director Kenneth Carlson does an excellent job of showing us the true meaning of ""small town"" America. Massillon is a town that is consumed by football, and it is made obvious to the film-goer with the shots of the town covered in ""Tiger"" signs and banners. There are many memorable scenes including the Tiger Lady and the soon-to-be-classic Bulldog Scene.
The cinematography in ""Go Tigers"" was great. The soundtrack of ""Go Tigers"" included a subtle underscore and the gripping music of Moby. During the final credits, the song ""Friday Nights"" by Katrina Carlson was a fitting end to a great documentation of Friday night football.
""Go Tigers"" is a perfect blend of hard hitting sports documentation and gripping human interest. Whether you've heard of the Massillon Tigers or not, you'll enjoy this film. The players will grow on you and you will root for them to succeed. I highly recommend this film and the people in the town of Massillon should be proud of this film.
After seeing Go Tigers, I am looking forward to Director Kenneth Carlson's next film. DG",1031011200,,1279,4.844748858447488
1736482,5,B00006ADER,"This is one of the most engaging documentaries I have ever seen (and I have watched hundreds).  One reason I enjoyed it so much is the absence of narration.  Carlson assembled interviews, footage, and newsreels in a manner that clearly explains the issues and events without the need for narration.  Thus, it was just like watching a feature film, only with actual characters and events.",1101081600,2,387,4.923076923076923
1736483,4,B00006ADER,"The documentary film maker, Kenneth Carlson, succeeds in building his comedy of manners toward a dramatic conclusion.  This documentary is a comedy in the sense ""Go Tigers"" has a happy ending, the main characters' situations in life improve throughout the film and the film is generally sunny though there are dark undercurrents to life in the city of Massillon, Ohio.

""Go Tigers"" is not about the game of football, it is about the effect of the game on a small town.  Massillon is barely a city and its ~30,000 people maintain a high school football stadium for 15,000+ people with a professional quality field and sports plant.  The Massillon High School is a football factory and the film follows three players and selected family members through an undefeated season.

There are some fantastic sequences of football that overshadow current U of A play because these boys are so consistently good. The game sequences gloss over the details of play, showing over the top fans, the band, parents of the central characters, cutting in and out to fantastic plays.  That is why I say it is not ""about"" football because, while the score board and play boards are shown there is minimal coverage of rules, technique, field position or strategy.

Locker room half time pep talks are given center stage.  The locker room scenes feature pointless rants and strings of obscenity by the players interspersed by level headed coaching and inspirational sermons by all Massillon's denominations.  The team always comes out energized by this motivation.

Massillon is NOT a wealthy city, so a theme is ""where does the money come from""?  The choices made by citizens are a plot thread that runs through the lives of three players and their families.  You'll need to see the film if you want to know more.

I will say, the strength and conditioning coach is an awesome, professional caliber athlete.  There is an all too brief walk on part by an opposing team's mascots who are fall down laughing funny.

The film covers town darkness, but not with a great deal of emphasis.  For example, the live tiger cub mascot mauls a small child in front of his mother.  The film maker is not blatant about the subtle points that are made about Massillon.

My one criticism of ""Go Tigers"" is that this film is 20 minutes too long.  It lingers over several football games in way too much detail, but at the same time not enough.  The games are covered in a superficial way without enough reference to play to make the games interesting.  Excited fans don't move the plot forward and you see them over and over and over and....",1100390400,4,2600,4.758928571428571
1736484,1,B00006ADER,"The game footage here is very good, except it is constantly interrupted, and has no continuity. Some of the interviews seem genuine, while others are obviously staged. The students and players act as if they were given the green light by the director to be as gross and obnoxious as possible. In that, they succeeded.

Entries at the Sundance Film Festival must be awful indeed for this film to be a Grand Prize nominee. The coaches stand around in the locker room, while the players take turns giving each other the cursing of their lives. I was rooting for the opposing team to give Massillon a beating every game.

I can't recommend this film to anyone. It doesn't teach about football, the language is awful. I don't feel I know anything about Ohio football that I didn't know before I saw the film. I hope the Tigers are not a typical team in Ohio.

For a real football film, I recommend ""The Last Game"".",1099440000,4,909,4.530487804878049

1736486,5,B00006ADER,"I bought this DVD in part because it was recommended to me by a fellow fan of H.G. Bissinger's magnificent book, ""Friday Night Lights"" who described this documentary as ""FNL in movie form.""
While I still found it inferior to FNL, ""Go Tigers"" is a suberb documentary in the vein of ""Hoop Dreams.""
Go Tigers follows the Massillon High School Tigers football team through the 1999 season. The Tigers are a legendary team in the state of Ohio. In fact, in 1951, a newsreel was put together chronicling the enormous success of the program - ""11 state championships in the last 15 seasons, more college players and captains than any other school in the nation, etc."" However, in 1998, the Tigers were a lackluster 4-6, a losing record almost unheard of in the program's long and storied history. The 1999 Tigers are not only playing to recapture the respect due their inheritance, but to convince the citizens of Massillon to approve a school levy that will bring in much needed funds to their deteriorating school. The players, coaches, boosters, parents, and everyone else associated with the team understands that the riding on the success of their team is not only community pride and bragging rights, but perhaps the fate of their school and thus, their football program as well.
The documentary mostly focuses on the Tigers' tri-captains: Their star quarterback, middle linebacker, and defensive tackle. These three are the core of the team, and on their young shoulders ride the hopes and dreams of an entire community.",1086566400,,1520,4.918287937743191
1736487,5,B00006ADER,An amazing story which shows how much excitement there is to football.  It portrays the game as a lifestyle and not a game.  It made me and others that have seen it come aware at what is at stake for high school football.  Eventhough i have player college football it makes me want to go back and relive my high school days.,1078358400,,324,4.193548387096774
1736488,5,B00006ADER,"I live in a town that I considered to be big on high school sports.  I was wrong.  This film portrays a town controlled by football so incredibly well.  It shows harsh and brutal reality, as well as unpredictability and compassion.  This film follows the people of Massilon, Ohio, a town where the Massilon High School Tigers football team rules everything.  It wonderfully portrays the people and the lifestyles of the town.  The film follows the three team captain, the coach and lots of random other towns people.  This documentary brings up big questions about whether sports are more important than education, social and ecemonical classes, high school ""recruiting"" and tax payers views on levy's to save the school.  This team is so popular in this town that all the money from the school system is pumped into the football program.  You play football or care about football or become an outcast.  There are pep rallies every week, stores devoted completely to the team and they even have an actual tiger for their mascot.  But with this football program being so big, the school is beginning to fail.  A levy is proposed to help fix them, but with the tigers coming off of a 4-6 losing season, it seems impossible to pass a levy without having an awesome season.  This documentarian has entered into this project not knowing the outcome and has made a brilliant film otu of it.  This is a must see for nearly anyone.  It is highly enjoyable, funny, suspenseful and dramatic.  I loved it.",1045180800,,1494,4.732558139534884

I have been to this town, seen the pre-game festivities, witnessed first hand the way this town all come together on a friday night, everyone, to cheer on their team.  It's the real life Varsity Blues, and it is amazing to see.  Everywhere you go in Massilion there are paw prints, murals, signs, and fans.  The movie does an excellent job of accurately portraying the feelings and emotions of this town and they way they view life.  If you ever get the opportunity, I recommend you experience it for yourself, that is If you can get tickets to a game!",1040342400,,638,4.56140350877193

7966157,5,B00006ADER,"Being from Alabama, I always assumed that the South was unsurpassed its myopic devotion to football. Go Tigers!, therefore, came as something of a shock. Massillon, Ohio, has taken football hysteria to new depths. Massillon's football boosters go so far as to visit the local hospital to put tiny plastic footballs in the cribs of newborn boys. (If newborn girls get anything, we don't hear about it).

The football in this movie is only mildly interesting. It is the people of Massillon who fascinate. The kids on the Massillon High team are under almost-unbearable pressure to win every game (something that their parents and coaches attempt to rationalize away). The ""win-at-all-costs"" philosophy definitely prevails; one of the team's star players has spent 15 months in jail for rape; another transferred into  Massillon High under questionable circumstances.

A good sub-plot in Go Tigers! concerns the Massillon's attempts to pass a levy to improve the local schools. While the community is passionate about football, education is not as popular. The three stars of the Massillon team all get scholarship offers to play college football; but two of the three struggle to get standardized test scores high enough to be admitted to college.

One of the more-interesting aspects of the film is the extent to which some families in Massillon plan their boys' education around their sons' high school football ""careers."" Many of the families hold their sons back for a second year in the 8th grade so that they will be bigger and more experienced by the time they are seniors.

As a final note, the cinematography in Go Tigers! is wonderful. The filmmakers captured some wonderful shots of Massillon.

Go Tigers! covers ground that other books and movies have also covered. Still, it provides an excellent look at the uneasy intersection of sport and education in our high schools.",1259280000,,1883,5.097402597402597
7966158,5,B00006ADER,"Go Tigers! is a wonderful, and wonderfully deceptive, movie.  When viewed casually it flies by like an NFL highlights reel, slick, glossy, beautifully photographed, and expertly edited.  These are universally familiar images, the great touchdown pass, the banks of lights, players banging into each other in testosterone-fueled euphoric celebration.  Then you stop to remember.  This is a documentary about high school football, and even more importantly, precisely what high school football means in Massillon, Ohio.  (Turns out it determines the future of the school system!)

Go Tigers! is the brainchild of Ken Carlson, he wrote, directed, and produced - and, as luck would have it, he's from Massillon.  This makes his achievement even more remarkable because the one attribute that dominates this movie is how even-handed and fair it is.

Movies in this genre fall into two groups, either they are love-struck anthems honoring the virtues of sportsmanship and its inspiring way of embodying all that is noble about life - or - they are supercilious indictments of the anti-intellectual hod-carriers and Neanderthals that brutalize each other instead of pursuing worthwhile activities - translating Proust into Sanskrit for example.

Massillon, Ohio is football crazy by any standard, but Carlson never takes cheap shots, he doesn't laugh at his subject, nor does he idealize it, he simply presents it.  This is the very hard work of a documentary, and Carlson succeeds.

Where Friday Night Lights gave us a grotesque portrait of the psychological, and physical, damage done by football mania in Texas, Go Tigers! calmly introduces us to a funeral director presenting the ""Obie Special,"" a deluxe coffin souped up to warm the cold dead heart of even the most rabid Tigers fan.  The film counts on you to do the math for yourself.",1159488000,8,1834,5.221843003412969

Not Texas, Not Florida, and Not California. It shows how strong the community and schools in ohio are when it comes to there football. Ohio is one of the top 4 recruiting states for college programs and this film is one reason why.

Seeing the insane obession of people who live there lives for high school football is hilarous! If you love football and are from a small town, you'll root through the whole film, if you don't live in a small town and don't care for football, you'll chuckle through most of it. I recommend watching ""Hands on a Hard Body"" after seeing this, another great doc.",1113436800,3,468,4.269662921348314
7966163,3,B00006ADER,"This is a film about a small town doped up on sports and religion, where kids - and I mean KIDS - play out parts for adults to further adult agendas of competition, superiority, and economic success.

The KIDS - and I emphase that - are easily hooked into the town's mass hysteria. After all, as one high-schooler puts it, ""the football players can get away with anything."" In an effort to please their parents and teachers, they get hyped on the game and sacrifice their identities... in exchange for trophy girlfriends and (apparently) adult-supported drinking parties.

A word about the drinking... since when DO high school *KIDS* get encouraged to drink and puke all over your house? And while we're at it, let's ask another question: since when do KIDS get tattoos? Don't you have to be 18 for that? Or perhaps these kids *are* 18 - at least - since we are told that a large amount of these players have been held back a grade or two to guarantee better chances of being bigger and stronger as seniors and - by extension - better football players.

But maybe that's going to be OK after all. One night of binging followed by a round of organized Christian prayer at school - PUBLIC school, mind you - will absolve all of any wrong doing.

These are children who are being plied with superficial elements of adulthood to guarantee their allegiance to the town's sole bringer of happiness, however false that is.

If we wonder WHY pro athletes take steroids and ""cheat"" to win, look no further. One lie begets another. After all, if parents want to hold their kids back a grade in school, ""it's their right as an American,"" as the Tigers' head coach informs us.

And if we wonder why kids aren't being prepared for college, and - the most important issue we face as a nation - getting EDUCATED to further themselves and this country, maybe we should reexamine the role of sports on our culture.

In a nation embroiled in red state/blue state battle, with ""morality"" as the battle cry, I wonder why this film isn't causing an uproar. Apparently, people do not care about what's right or fair - only who wins. It is too bad that people - in their near-sightedness - see only short term victory, when the long term battles are about to be lost.",1104537600,10,2245,4.542079207920792
