4530660,5,B0052SO0FG,"In the early 1960's the Hollywood Rat Pack, made up of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Peter Lawford and other so-called swingers of the era, were so popular that they could get any movie green-lighted. Consequently they produced a few great films and several notable turkeys. In my opinion, ""Johnny Cool"" is one of their best. It's got a fast-moving plot, lots of action and - like all Rat Pack films - beautiful dames. In this case the beauty is stunning young Elizabeth Montgomery a few years before her signature role in TV's ""Bewitched."" The story line is simple but plausible: an infamous Sicilian gangster is spirited away to the United States in order to kill off the leaders of an opposing mob faction. Surprisingly the story is very loosely based on fact; the real Salvatore Giordano, Henry Silva's character, was a tough Sicilian ganglord who became an American ally and renowned anti-Nazi guerrilla fighter during World War II. After V-E Day Giordano reverted to his criminal ways and was eventually gunned down by the local police. In the film Giordano's death is faked and he's transported to America as a hired gun. The film is in black & white which lends it a kind of gritty timeliness. Henry Silva, who made his bones playing heavies in movies like ""The Tall T"" and a ""Hatful of Rain"" before he struck gold in 1960's ""Ocean's 11"" is at the top of his game here. For those who like vintage action flicks I give this film my highest recommendation.",1316131200,44,1473,4.713178294573644

4530687,3,B0052SO0FG,"What a weird little movie, not great, not flashy, but a lot of great character actors, and the editing and script seem to know exactly what they're trying to do and no more or no less. I liked that there was a lot left unsaid and unexplained, because it didn't need to be, which so many people seem to miss with movies like this. And what an ending. Nice to see a young Elizabeth Montgomery playing an ingenue.

It's mediocre, but head and shoulders above a Roger Corman film, and enjoyable as a curiosity. I completely understand both sides of the reviews here where some hate it and some love it--if it sounds interesting to you, then you will probably like it.",1461888000,,663,4.434426229508197

4530702,5,B0052SO0FG,"Great film from 1963. They're all here. All the great character actors from this era of films. Even Telly Savalas appears in the film. A great story that moves very quickly and like Mr Cool himself, has a dramatic ending! 4stars at least",1451088000,,237,4.534883720930233

4530704,3,B0052SO0FG,This is one of those films you never see on television anymore. It's probably been at least 30 years since I've seen Johnny Cool and I had all but forgotten it until I saw it was available on Amazon streaming. I remember this film being really good which is why I watched it right away on Amazon. Apparently my taste in films has changed as Johnny Cool hasn't aged well. The film looks dated and anything but cool. The one thing I still enjoy is the title song by Sammy Davis Jr.,1446595200,,479,4.217391304347826

4530707,2,B0052SO0FG,A particularly odd movie. Stilted writing and acting. A young Elizabeth Montgomery is lovely. Also a nice cameo by Sammy Davis Jr. It's kind of a wreck yet oddly fascinating.,1441324800,,174,4.833333333333333
4530708,4,B0052SO0FG,Somewhat stiff stylized... but what a window into 50's Gangster gestalt... A young Elizabeth Montgomery is a bright spot here... And of course Henry Silva (John Saxon's older Brother) is great as usual!,1440028800,,202,5.151515151515151

Seeing the cast members of Oceans 11 it is one of those rare films that make one sit down with a bag of micro wave popcorn and beer
and watch! bring out some movies",1436572800,2,295,3.8524590163934427

4530713,3,B0052SO0FG,"Odd but effective little revenge yarn, with the great character actor Henry Silva getting a rare chance at playing the lead. Although no blood is shown, the film is ahead of its time in tone: Cool is a very brutal and sadistic killer.  A young Elizabeth Montgomery is very sexy and does a good job portraying a woman who isn't as worldly as she thinks she is.  This is a low-budget 1960s black and white film with a lot of cheesy elements, but stay with it, it's worth watching!",1431388800,2,478,4.359550561797753

4530716,5,B0052SO0FG,"Being a Baby Boomer, this is a movie of my generation. What can I say, Anyone who is of my generation and a movie lover, especially of gangster movies, and this is a classic, not only will love this movie but will have a copy in their own library",1419292800,,246,4.040816326530612
4530717,4,B0052SO0FG,"Elizabeth Montgomery is mesmerizing in this!  She appears after the initial 19 minutes of the film as the character Dare.  She plays a beautiful and innocent woman (her character tells Johnny Cool that she's 27 years old) who meets Johnny Cool at a restaurant and takes an interest to him only later to find out that he's a murderer.  She does fall in love with him but in the end reports his actions to a widowed wife (of which Johnny murdered the husband) and Johnny gets caught in the end.  Dare becomes distraught after learning that a vehicle she drove Johnny in with explosives almost killed two young children when reading it in a newspaper.  I won't give away too much more of the plotline....

It's interesting to note that because of this movie the series ""Bewitched"" came about with her starring in it as Samantha Stephens.  William Asher was producer/director of this movie and he states in the Elizabeth Montgomery bio on DVD that I own that he knew immediately Elizabeth was perfect for this role and thus ended the casting call.  The two fell in love while filming this and together wanted to work together and settled on the 1960s-1970s TV show ""Bewitched"".  Unfortunately, the two later divorced.

Peter Lawford is executive producer of this movie.  There is a trailer included in the DVD (but no other special features) and Peter states how this is the first movie he produced.  Peter Lawford played on ""The Doris Day Show"" in the 1970s as one of Doris Day's love interests.

Ordinarily I wouldn't watch a shooting/murderer type of movie, but this was worth watching for me personally b/c I'm a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery.  She looks the same as in ""Bewitched"" only with darker hair.",1413763200,,1702,4.725423728813559
4530718,3,B0052SO0FG,"Elizabeth Montgomery is great anytime she's on screen, especially her early work.  The story is interesting but not surprising.  Henry Silva is one of the all time bad guys and he does his part in this movie.",1405382400,2,208,4.594594594594595
4530719,4,B0052SO0FG,"I saw this movie went I was a little boy, I have enjoyed Mr Silva, in many films. Happy to know he is still living.",1400716800,,115,3.64
4530720,4,B0052SO0FG,"This is one odd film but  worth watching if you're in the mood for that sort of thing.  Just ""what sort of thing"" it is you'll have to see for yourself.  Violent and irritating at times but also sort of mesmerizing in a perverse sort of way.  Hard to get ones head around the lovely Ms. Montgomery playing a trashy mob moll.  She's one strange lady in this film.  But a knock out she was, no wonder America fell in love with her a year or two later in the hit TV series ""Bewitched.""  They don't make movies like this anymore... and perhaps that's a good thing.  But having said that, I'd recommend this movie.",1389484800,,609,4.234782608695652
4530721,4,B0052SO0FG,I enjoyed watching this movie because I reminsence through my childhood. I have been trying to find this movie for a long time. I'm now more convinced that if your looking for an item check Amazon.com first.,1387929600,,207,4.621621621621622
4530738,5,B0052SO0FG,"It occurred to me while watching this film is that it had to have been seen by Coppola, Scorsese, and most definitely Tarantino and also inspired them.  The view of organized mob justice that is on display here had its precedent in Fritz Lang's masterwork ""M"" where the underworld try and sentence a child murderer played by Peter Lorre.  This film could also serve as a predecessor to James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" with Henry Silva playing the killing machine without the metal skeleton.  Much is made of the Rat Pack connection but fans of Stanley Kubrick should note the presence of Joe Turkel and Richard Anderson who both appeared in ""Paths of Glory"".  Regardless, this is a mesmerizing film from start to finish.  It paints an indelible portrait of a monster with few redeeming human qualities which may explain its relative obscurity.  Silva with his pronounced cheekbones and impenetrable stare sends chills down your spine.  A young pre-""Bewitched"" Elizabeth Montgomery is absolutely stunning as the New York socialite who falls in love with a killer despite her better judgment.  The cast is littered with terrific supporting parts most notably some of executive producer Peter Lawford's Rat Pack buddies including Sammy Davis Jr. who also warbles the cool title tune.  The film looks great with director William Asher giving it a black and white documentary feel.  For fans of great cinema and those of the crime genre in particular this film is an imperative.",1382832000,2,1474,5.02880658436214
4530739,5,B0052SO0FG,"This was a gangster movie in its own little time zone: too late for the classic 40' + 50's gangster flicks and too early for some of slicker gangster films of the 1960's. It is an absolutely fine film, with Henry Silva (one of the best gangster actors of all time) and Elizabeth Montgomery. We see dedicated revenge happening in the U.S. and in Italy. A bit dated, but a superb movie.",1377907200,2,384,4.347222222222222

4530741,5,B0052SO0FG,"A great insight into the mind of the Rat Pack era. Produced by Peter Lawford (I'm guessing it was just before he was banished by Sinatra, but not sure). With cameos & bit parts from Sammy Davis and many of the other actors who also appeared in Ocean's 11 and the rest of the Rat Pack films, as well as great location scenes in Las Vegas, Bel-Air, Beverly Hills,  LA and New York.

4530743,5,B0052SO0FG,"I saw this movie years ago and since then have found it very difficult to track down until ordering from amazon recently. I wasn't aware of the fact that is was Lawfords first trial through his production company at the time. Silva does a fine job walking through each scene trying to look tough with that baby face. Sammy has a small role, but seems fairly smooth as the suave gambling foil. Montgomery pulls together a real gem in one of her earliest movie roles. You don't have to be a rat packer to enjoy this piece. Not a classic, but it is a solid production . . . Thanks Mr. Lawford!",1329004800,6,590,4.276785714285714

4530745,4,B0052SO0FG,"J.F.K.'s brother-in-law Peter Lawford executive produced this stark b/w crime
thriller, and roped in Rat Pack pals Sammy Davis Jr. and Joey Bishop for bit
roles, and also Brad Dexter, noted for once saving Old Blue Eyes Sinatra from
actually drowning in the ocean.  Fans of sixties' T.V. will also enjoy har-har-
ing Jim Backus, bald-but-sexy Telly Savalas, and delectable Elizabeth Montgomery
as the gorgeous gal that Johnny Cool makes into his moll.

A Mafia chieftain (the great cobra-faced Marc Lawrence) captures a notorious Sicilian
bandit (the tall, cruel-eyed Henry Silva), and grooms him for two years into a
cultured, well-dressed professional assassin.  Now called ""Johnny Cool,"" Silva is
sent to the U.S.A. on a coast-to-coast rampage of revenge on the ""Don's"" enemies.
In between murders, Johnny sweeps Liz Montgomery off her delightful feet.  When
he is away, Liz weeps to her gal pal, ""If I saw him now, I know I would crawl just
to be with him!""  The lucky dog!  Posing as cops, two rival hoodlums burst into
her hotel room, and abuse her most sorely.  When Johnny returns and sees Liz
hurting, he pockets a Ginsu steak knife and goes to show those rats ""It cuts,
it slices, or your money back!""

""Johnny Cool"" was originally reviewed as a brutal, sadistic, vicious, non-stop
bloodbath.  As a matter of fact, much of the violence is not shown directly,
and no blood is on display.  What does come across is a completely ruthless
attitude on the part of Johnny, his employer, and also their enemies.  I must
say the conclusion, rife with betrayal and fiendishly lingering punishment, should
chill you to your marrow. Dig the furioso jazz music by Billy May, and the
immortal ""Ballad of Johnny Cool"" (Sammy Cahn, Jimmy Van Heusen), sung over the
finale by Sammy Davis, Jr. ""Johnny Cool"" was ""Headline Hot"" in 1963, and it's
still pretty cool today.",1326326400,15,1862,4.87936507936508

4530747,4,B0052SO0FG,"I first saw this film on British television around 1968 when, of course, it still seemed quite fresh with its shockingly violent anti-hero. Violent anti-heroes were very much in fashion then (eg Clint Eastwood in the 'Dollars' films). It was also quite surprising then to see Elizabeth Montgomery (famous at the time for her cute comedy role as Samantha in Bewitched) playing in such a hard-edged movie. For many years Johnny Cool seemed to be unavailable. There were internet rumours that disputes over ownership of the movie rights prevented its distribution. Not having seen it in over 40 years I remembered it as being as sharp a gangster movie as Point Blank with which it shares some similarities. Point Blank has aged well but Johnny Cool looks a little dated now. The advert for the film (included on the DVD) is a curio in itself. It looks quaint, almost amateurish, with Silva looking less than deadly in his rather ill-advised trilby hat. Strange to see William Asher proselytizing the story as though Johnny Cool were a new kind of hero in a new kind of movie. Sammy Davis Junior's title song sounds very corny these days and his acting is barely adequate.

The abrupt and unexpected ending to the story intrigued me. I wanted to know what the author, John McPartland, originally had in mind so I bought the novel 'The Kingdom of Johnny Cool'. The movie actually follows the book quite closely but what is missing (inevitably) is a deeper insight into the background and motivation of the characters. McPartland is excellent at filling out these details with a few brief lines. The film makers have changed some characters without apparent reason. For example, Oby Hinds, in the book an exceptionally brutal gangland thug, is depicted in the movie as just a fat greedy Las Vegas casino owner. Elizabeth Montgomery's character, Dare Guiness, has her destiny and her motivation re-interpreted, playing down the sexual element. Also missing from the film (but very important in the book) is a clear depiction of the nature of the crime syndicate Johnny Cool is trying to take over.

All in all, an interesting obscure curio and a remarkable film in its day.",1318118400,20,2166,4.867208672086721
