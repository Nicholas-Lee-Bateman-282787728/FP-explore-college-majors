8688859,2,B00PNQN8HS,"I found myself flipping channels throughout this movie. Whenever I came back to it, Bonita Granville was either crying or depressed about something. Really, it was more about her lousy moods than the great music that should have dominated this film. The whole thing would have been fabulous with just the promised stars - but they were given very little air time. If its a movie about music - let me hear the music.",1449273600,,415,4.621621621621622

8688861,5,B00PNQN8HS,"Ive just read a few of the previous reviews posted here (you can sort by date) and, upfront, I want to say that if you are looking for documentary or performance film with the musicians like Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman, Joe Venuti and Charlie Barnet (listed on package), you MAY be disappointed. Yes, they are in the film five minutes before the end (not over end credits as someone said) and they each get a QUICK solo. And Connie Boswell is here too (a few minutes before) performing a complete number.

BUT, if you like musicals of the 1940s and enjoy hearing some great music throughout an 89 minute film, I think youll love this film. Made in 1942 by director William Dieterle (he made The Life of Emil Zola), this film has NEVER been released on home video in the US. And this print was digitally remastered from a mater print at the Library of Congress. It is in BD and DVD format and my DVD copy is gorgeous!

Yes, its fictional love story starring Jackie Cooper and Bonita Granville (and some of the facts may be wrong. But it starts by having slaves in Africa coming to New Orleans and bringing their rhythms to church (great job by Hall Johnson Choir!) where it follows a young black cornet player and a white female piano player to St. Louis and then Chicago).  I cant find out who the musicians are on the soundtrack to which Cooper and his band mates are synching to but they do a good job.

At times the story is melodramatic but there seems to be jazz in nearly every scene.

The icing on the cake in the DVD set is the group of nine jazz shorts from the late 1920s to the 40s. Most are really common Public Domain Paramount shorts  Like Duke Ellingtons Symphony in Black and Louis Armstrongs  Rhapsody in Black and Blue  but the prints are nice. The less-common shorts are Ellingtons 1933 Bundle of Blues (great dancing here too!) and Jazz Al La Cuba from 1933. Most are10 minutes ling). The only less than pristine short is the classic St. Louis Blues, Bessie Smiths only film (from 1929. Sadly there are no really clean copies of this landmark performance. And Ellingtons Black and Tan Fantasy) also from 1929 (and running nearly 20 minutes) is not up to modern standards but still a classic. So the shorts will appeal to both those who are familiar with them and those just discovering them for the first time.

The Cohen Film Group really takes pride in their projects and approaches the level of the Criterion Collection. If you have any interest in jazz from the 20s and 30s I think youll find it worthwhile spending the time with Cooper and Granville (and youll find yourself breaking into a smile in many places.

Like other Cohen releases there is a 8-page booklet enclosed but there are no essays or text other than chapter list and cast list and some still from film. It would have been great to have some background on the film though.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8688862,2,B00PNQN8HS,"The ad that got my attention for this movie would have you believe that some of the great musicians of that period were in the movie.  Not so!  The movie is about jazz during the early days but didn't feature any of the great players like Gene Krupa, Harry James, Benny Goodman, etc.  They only play a little at the end while the credits are rolling by.  A cheap trick to get you (me) to buy it.",1435795200,,395,4.090909090909091
8688863,5,B00PNQN8HS,"Excellent package from Cohen Media Group. The feature film, SYNCOPATION, is a rather flimsy story, but it contains footage of some of the great  jazz musicians of the 1940s, including Benny Goodman, Harry James, Gene Krupa, Joe Venuti and Charlie Barnett. For that alone, this movie is a valuable document. But the reason this DVD-BluRay package is superlative is the accompanying shorts, nine in all, including ST. LOUIS BLUES, the only filmed record of the great Bessie Smith; RHAPSODY IN BLACK AND BLUE, featuring the young Louis Armstrong; Duke Ellington's SYMPHONY IN BLACK, featuring the Duke Ellington Orchestra with Billie Holiday. This is a must for any fan of great American music!",1432425600,7,691,5.169642857142857
8688864,4,B00PNQN8HS,"Great jazz music but very hokey, old fashioned plot.  This is a beautiful restoration in Blu Ray but the film is a disappointment for me..  Not a gem but I guess worth seeing especially if you like jazz..  Nice extras included.",1430870400,,227,4.487804878048781
8688865,2,B00PNQN8HS,"Phew! This is one old-time movie. Some charming moments, but there's not much action for a ""jazz"" picture, and only about four bars of plot in a 32-bar movie. Don't expect anything but 1930s-era stereotypes of African Americans in New Orleans and Chicago. (Although there is a rather shocking opening with slaves being gathered in Africa -- perhaps an attempt a being broad-minded.) Also, don't expect much from the ""All American Dance Band"" -- they don't show up until the last 3 minutes of the film in a strange little tacked-on coda. An eager-to-please film that never really gets off the ground.

PS: On the off-chance that you're looking into this movie because of comedian Robert Benchley: he's not in it. He's listed in the credits, but that's an error: his part was cut out of the final movie.",1428192000,6,801,4.762589928057554
