8251664,5,B0013KY868,"I have been wanting to see this again for some and came across it on Amazon.  This is one of the best documentaries I have seen and though completely theoretical, it does open ones imagination to the wonders of nature and the possibilities that exist beyond our planet.

The computer generated graphics are outstanding the story line very creative making this seems less educational and more entertaining though it is both. I was captivated by every minute of this show.",1343692800,,470,4.8625

I might even have to admit I am a little hooked! I am more Noah's Ark than all this, but it was definitely a cool, educational show. I think it is well worth purchasing.",1231286400,5,300,4.280701754385965
