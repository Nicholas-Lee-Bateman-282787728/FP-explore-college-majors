5105161,5,B007R6NG88,"Superb acting by the two leads, Soo Ae and Kim Rae-won, supporting cast was equally good. The box set description says this drama ""breaks hearts quietly."" It does. It breaks your heart quietly and steadily, increasing with intensity, as only a terrible disease like Alzheimer's can do. It's a story about an intelligent, proud thirty-year old woman who is struck with this disease and the man who gives up everything to stay by her side. During the roughest times, and when his parents beg him to please put her in a hospice, he refuses saying ""She is still my wife."" He loves her to the end and even when she leaves him in death. A box of tissue is definitely required. The drama is true to what happens to a person brought down by Alzheimer's disease. I've experienced this disease, not personally, but with family. Excellent drama.",1347580800,6,834,4.680272108843537
5105162,5,B007R6NG88,"Even thought I haven't bought it yet, I watched on t.v. and it was beautiful and heart braking at the same time. To see him taking care of her and trying to make here happy and confortable as much as he could until the end. To see him suffer in silence and trying to be strong at the same time as he gave strentgh to those wgo love her until the very end. Just beautiful.",1340841600,4,371,3.96

8521256,5,B007R6NG88,"sad but honest insight behind a terrible disease and a powerful love.  well acted and portrayed.  The disks themselves are the YA version which is the best you can get for English subtitles.  YA is out of business now.  All their work is out of print.  At this amazon price it's an absolute steal.  No one can tell story's like the Koreans can.  A story of Love vs Alzheimer's, we'll call it a draw.  PS you have to deal with subtitles unless you can understand Korean.  After a while you forget your reading subtitles tho.",1423353600,,523,4.421052631578948

8521258,5,B007R6NG88,What a terrific movie great actress and a great actor . They do not make you feel like they are acting what a performance. I truly love it.,1411344000,,139,4.0
8521259,5,B007R6NG88,"If you've been a fan of Kim Rae Won, you will welcome what I believe to be his first work since returning from military service.  The writers have developed a story with difficult subject matter and all the actors treat it delicately and respectfully.  Co-starring is Park Soo Ae, who is superb as the 30-yr.-old who is the victim of Alzheimer's.  Watching her deal with the progression of this disease is informative and inspiring, never over-playing it for sympathy.  Mention should be made of the young actor who plays the role of her brother; ALL the supporting actors are great, as well.  Kim Rae Won never disappoints, and his portrayal of the devoted husband is perfect.  I highly recommend this series, especially this particular version which has subtitles that are not distracting.",1366761600,4,791,4.954545454545454
8521260,5,B007R6NG88,Kim Rae Won again proves what a talented actor he is.  The subject of Alzheimer's disease was so eloquently presented.,1365552000,2,118,4.9
8521261,4,B007R6NG88,"A real walk in the step of losing one's memory and indentity and how it affects the people close to the fading person. Very sad and depressing, but a breath of courage on the part of a man rarely shown. A man who not just stands by, but assumes responsibility for the person he loves and her tragic diagnosis and life as it forever changes and then ends. If you have the courage, watch it. You will not forget it.",1349913600,3,413,4.175
