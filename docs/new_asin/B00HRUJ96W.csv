6201621,5,B00HRUJ96W,"Sufferin' succotash!!  It's your favorite Looney Tunes characters all on 4 action-packed DVD's for you to enjoy time and time again!  :)  The first 2 DVD's contain Vol. 2 of the Spotlight Collection which has 30 cartoons (the 2 ""bonus"" episodes included are black-and-white)

There are some particular episodes that I loved, such as the ones with Sylvester and Tweety.  (I tawt I taw a puttytat??  I did -- I did see a puttytat!!)  Another favorite one of mine is the 2-part opera episode with Elmer, his dog, and Bugs, followed by the ""Blue Danube"" skit.  (It's EXTREMELY funny when Elmer's clothes fall off and he lets out his funny, weird laugh!).

As for the 2 ""movie"" DVD's, they are merely just a bunch of cartoon shorts told from Bugs' and Daffy Duck's narrations, respectively.  I've always loved the episode where Bugs has to deal with the huge bull (I love how Bugs walks up to the bull and smacks him in the face -- 4 times!!).  Then we have the 10-minute closing opus of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote (I never realized until now that Bugs was Wile E. Coyote's first victim!).  That poor coyote tries SO many times to make Road Runner stew but every single time, his Acme inventions literally blow up in his face (my favorite part was when his body was shaking after golfing down a huge bottle of earthquake pills).

I'm still in the process of watching the final ""movie"" disc which starts Yosemite Sam and Gossamer the red monster that chases poor Bugs (no amount of a Bugs Bunny makeover can make a red monster look prettier).  So for anyone who LOVES the Looney Tunes franchise, this 4 disc set is such a wonderful treat at a low price of $15 (I got it at Wal-Mart).  And it doesn't matter if 100 years may pass -- the slapstick humor will ALWAYS be timeless for many generations to come, so please don't miss out!!  :)",1402617600,4,1834,4.478915662650603

8635160,5,B00HRUJ96W,Great Looney Tunes DVD. The Spotlight Vol. 2 Collection has lots of fantastic Tweety Bird cartoons. Also there's some great cartoons with Daffy and Porky. There is not a Vol. 3 in the Spotlight Collection there is only the two Bugs Movies but they are great. You gotta love Bugs Bunny and Tweety Bird.
