8109107,4,B000EGDBWY,"Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo Y Caldern famous artist and more has her story told through her art.

The are many good books on the market that show some of Frida's best work and many that have a good overview of her life as the daughter of Wilhelm Kahlo and the ""on and off wife"" of the famous mural painter Diego Rivera.

I originally saw the movie based on the book ""Frida"" (2002) with Salma Hayek. The film was well done and followed a chronological and dramatized depiction on Frida.

This film, part of a series on Great Women Artists, takes a different approach as the story is told as a background while her art is the main focus; her story is told as a description of the art we see. Several items are not in most of the books or films.

The down-side of this presentation is the reader seems to be translating. Once he correctly pronounces a work and later pronounces it phonetically as written.

The up-side of this presentation is that the same facts have different spin or connotation leaving you with a completely different view of Frida and her life.",1507248000,3,1063,4.487046632124352

8109109,2,B000EGDBWY,"This is one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen.  As others have mentioned, it's basically just a narrated PowerPoint presentation.  The narrator spoke in a monotone, and worst of all, consistently mispronounced the Spanish words, including names and places.  In addition, a lot of the ""facts"" he presented were just plain wrong.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I did learn some new things about Frida life's and paintings.  But I had to force myself to sit through it.  Buyer beware.",1493683200,,510,4.872093023255814
8109110,5,B000EGDBWY,"This DVD is not for everybody but is highly recommended for Frida fans. There is not much entertainment value since this basically is a powerpoint lecture packaged on DVD. The lecturer even sounds like a boring college professor. For fans however, it's a great way to learn more about Frida and her wonderful art. The slide show of her paintings is fantastic. The narration, given lecture style, contains a good description of where she was in her life and what she was thinking as each painting was produced. As I mentioned, delivery of the narration is done in an unemotional college lecture style. The information contained in the words however is fantastic.",1215993600,4,661,4.910714285714286
8109111,5,B000EGDBWY,"On the one hand, works on Frida are starting to be produced exponentially.  On the other hand, I'd say we diehard Frida fans can never know enough about our idol.  The Kultur series is just a slideshow with a lecture.  Some of their installments are incredibly boring, but since I love seeing Frida's work and learning about her, I was psyched to experience every minute.  Most Kultur installments just analyze the art, but this one spoke mostly of Frida's life, which makes sense because her life was so fascinating and heavily influenced what she painted.  Unlike other works that I'm more than happy to put in an envelope and mail back, this one stayed open for awhile, just in case I wanted to see it again and again and again.

I love Hayek's film, just like everyone else does.  However, this differed.  It said Frida's clothes were blown off in the trolley accident whereas Salma was seen clothed.  This says nothing of Frida being on the cover of French Vogue but says one self-portrait was the first Mexican painting the Louvre ever bought.  Like in Tasch's biography, this documentary displayed Frida's poorly done work produced late in life, unlike the film.  It said more about her father.  I also learned that ""Two Nudes in a Forest"" was painted after the collage that included it as an image.

This lecture never says ""bisexual"" or ""lesbian,"" it instead once says ""Frida's attraction to women.""  Though Diego's adultery is emphasized, nothing is said of Frida's liaisons with women and men.  It shows Trotsky, but never says the two got down with each other.  Unlike anything else I've seen on Frida, it say her second marriage to Diego was celibate.",1162425600,6,1664,4.765734265734266
