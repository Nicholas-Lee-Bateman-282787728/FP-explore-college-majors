1941158,5,B0000SWN4I,"MJ is the king of pop and this dvd shows you why.  It has videos to his number one songs!!  It even has Dirty Diana! I have been looking for that video and MJ finally released it on this DVD. Also it has a version of You rock my world (not the long version).  Believe me, after watching this short film MJ will totally rock your world!  He is so great and talented! Support him and buy this DVD!! btw, the number ones cd is very great and i recommend you buy that and this dvd together.  Great DVD!!",1073174400,7,499,4.0
1941159,3,B0000SWN4I,"My contribution to the Michael Jackson legal defense fund.  I found it lacking.  I was happy to see the particular songs included, but for the DVD vs. the CD, I think they should have given us more.  ""Bad"" is the short version, as if you're suddenly just dropped into the middle of the video.  ""Smooth Criminal"" is the frenetic version, with the entire video speeding along like a picture of star-tracking.  I was sorely disappointed in this in particular, because I love this stylish video.  Oh, and for the last reviewer, Michael IS in ""Man in the Mirror"", right near the end in the shot with the little kids in, I assume, Africa.  Watch it again, it's very brief.  I also thought the quality in the earlier videos was really grainy; they must have been able to do SOMETHING to clean it up a bit.  It looked amateurish.  That all having been said, it is a great collection of MTV versions of his videos, but I'll stick with his History DVDs for the long versions, which are always better.  I was also disappointed that they didn't include ""Ghosts"" on here, or ""Say, Say, Say"", which I can't find on any of his DVDs.",1072915200,16,1117,4.45320197044335
1941160,5,B0000SWN4I,"This is going to be the most critical review I will ever do of Michael Jackson. ""Number Ones"" was Ok, but it could have been so much better.
Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough: A bit better than the video for ""Rock With You"" but not that great.
*
Rock With You: Basically just Michael singing in front of laser lights.
*
Billie Jean: This is a good one. Michael is being followed by a secret agent, who is trying to prove he slept with ""Billie Jean"". Whatever Michael touches lights up. Interesting.
****
Beat It: This is good too, like all the videos (rather, short films) from the album Thriller. Michael is lying on his bed, telling you about these 2 gangs who are out to get him. Then he goes out and unites the 2 gangs, they are all dancing together in the end.
*****
Thriller: This is the original, full-length Thriller. And it's great, even by today's standards. Excellent use of all-real special effects (no computers used). Thriller is basically a mock-horror film, lots of zombies and stuff.
*****
Bad: This is not the full-length Bad. I don't know why, but this DVD shortens/speeds up a lot of Michael's best short film, and it's really annoying. Well anyway, even though Bad is short, it's cool. Great choreography.
***
The Way You Make Me Feel: Ok, Michael basically is chasing a girl.
**
Man In The Mirror: Doesn't actually show Michael, instead it shows policticans, famine and war victims, Mother Theresa, you get the point. It has a nice message, but I don't think it was a good choice for this DVD, which was meant to be chowcasing Michael's talents.
*
Smooth Criminal: This is NOT the original Smooth Criminal. Instead of the original, they sped up all the dancing and added snippets from the movie ""Moonwalker"". Although I was disappointed about this, I still liked this one. It was kind of scary. But I don't know why they didn't use the full version. *****
Dirty Diana: Alright, but nothing to write home about. Michael is at a concert singing about ""Dirty Diana"", a groupie.
**
Black or White: Argh! They shortened Black or White! Damn it, damn it. It only shows the first half, ends after the girls turn into boys, before the panther bit. I'm annoyed, but it's still good.
****
You Are Not Alone: I have never seen the original for this, but there is apparently meant to be a bit where Michael has wings. This isn't on the DVD. You can see Lisa Marie Presley in this one. It's quite nice.
***
Earth Song: Probably my favourite on this DVD, it's so cool. Michael is sad because the forest was burnt, and it keeps flashing back-and-forth from him and other people who have had bad thing happening to them. At the end, you see this person who has been shot open his eyes. Then everything reversed and the world is good again.
*****
Blood On The Dance Floor: This is just one version of Blood on the Dance Floor. I can't say I really like the video, but it's a good song.
**
You Rock My World: This is nice. Erm, I don't know how to explain it, but it ends in a fire and features Chris Tucker, from Rush Hour Two.
****
Overall, I was disappointed with this. Don't get me wrong, I like the videos, but they left out so much. What they should have left out was: *Rock With You
*Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough
-Both were just a bit dull, and Michael has so many better videos than these.
*The Way You Make Me Feel
*Dirty Diana
-Both get boring very quickly.
*Man in the Mirror
-Doesn't even show Michael.
Also, they should have had the full-length Bad, Smooth Criminal, Black or White (and You Are Not Alone?). Also, a different version of Blood on the Dance Floor.
To make this really good, I think they could have included some more stuff from HIStory (especially Scream and They Don't Care About Us) and Dangerous (In the Closet, Heal the World?), as most of his newer videos are better than the older stuff. They should definitely have had Ghosts, his best short film.",1072915200,56,3885,4.450210378681627
1941161,4,B0000SWN4I,"This is definitley one of those really great MJ moments. The videos are amazing! problem is the way they shortened ""Bad"",""The Way You Make Me Feel"",""Smooth Criminal""+ ""Black Or White"". My favourite on this DVD is by far ""Blood On The Dance Floor"" I mean, its such a great video, it may not be a classic but damn it its really good. This DVD comes in 4 different covers ""Off The Wall"",""Thriller"",""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"" They all reflect different songs. Ive Got the ""Bad"" cover, though I really wanted The ""Dangerous"" cover. All together....this DVD is great! It would be amazing if they made those videos more longer and used some other ones like ""Remember The Time"" and god, atleast ""Heal The World"" its MJ's fave MJ song I was certain they were gonna include that on the DVD. This DVD is great!!!!. You may feel A Bit Odd and I guess ripped off if you own ""HIStory Videos Vol I"" and ""HIStory Videos Vol II"" well I did, but it comes with videos I have rarely ever seen like ""Dirty Diana"", ""Blood On The DAnce Floor"","" Man In The Mirror"" and even ""You Rock My World"" so it is value but then its a bit cringey. But I want to collect all Of MJ's works and if you are like me and also want to collect all of his works then this is one DVD you should definitley not miss out on!.",1070928000,8,1273,4.264462809917355
1941162,4,B0000SWN4I,"This is my second MJ DVD to own, my first purchase was History on Film II, and i loved that one. This one is a great addition to my collection! I especially love the long edition of You Rock My World. And any MJ fan would def. want to pick up this DVD, support MJ and get some of your favorite classic songs!!!!!!",1070928000,3,313,3.984126984126984
1941163,5,B0000SWN4I,now while there are Better versions of DVD/VHS tapes of His Videos this is still a Must have in your collection. MJ truly is the M of MTV to Me. He changed the game&took His Music to another level with how He presented His Short Films.the Brother is One of the Baddest Artists Ever&He Commanded your Attention in the Video World as well.,1070150400,5,337,4.365079365079365

The very basic packaging tells you that this is a no frills DVD.  Many of MJ's best videos are presented and that is all you get.  No fancy menu or insert.  No live performances, interviews, commercials or still gallery.  Nothing.  Not even a discography.  This doesn't cut it in this day and age of DVD.  The videos are great, but this is hardly a difinitive collection.  Expecially since all of these (save ""You Rock My World"") are already available on other discs.  And why do video collections keep getting released with shortened or re-edited videos?  We want the FULL original video ok!  Is that too much to ask?
It's hard to go wrong with an MJ music video and these are all great.  But this DVD could have (and should have) been definitie.  Instead it's just yet another collection of videos collectors already have.",1069545600,433,1314,4.644736842105263
1941165,3,B0000SWN4I,"""Number Ones"" was good but lacked a little in being creative.  ""HIStory on Film vol II"" was incredible and so was ""Dangerous the Short Films.""  However on this one there are no special live performances, commercials, or interviews.  Compared to the rest of the DVD world it was just missing a few things.  Plus you don't get the 14 minute video of ""You Rock My World"", the long unedited version of ""Black or White"", and I don't like the fast paced version ""Smooth Criminal.""  If you are a big fan or would like to see some of his newer videos I would buy this DVD.  Although if you want a good DVD on Michael Jackson I would purchase ""HIStory on Film vol II.""  I only bought it so I could get the last two videos and have easy access to each video instead of fast forwarding to them on the tapes I already own",1069372800,7,809,4.214285714285714

1941609,5,B0000SWN4I,"There's no doubt about it. Michael Jackson was one of the greatest (and most controversial) showmen on Earth.

There WERE other videos that could have been on here, such as ""Leave Me Alone"" and ""Scream"" -two videos that I always found visually arresting (the songs weren't up to par with his other hits, but his music was hardly ever horrible).

I won't list the songs, because you can see for yourself on the description what they are and it's redundant to do so.

Of course, since most of these are back in the 70s/80s, MJ can be seen as ""altered"" slightly and then towards the end he's pretty much a unisex Peter Pan with a black fro-let. I admit that I had some difficulty staggering through my explanation of that to my 8 year old daughter, who likes Michael Jackson but doesn't understand why he ""changed"" so much.

A few notables:

""Thriller"". Back when this first came out, I was in Jr. High school and MTV was IT...of course, I had to get the DVD just to see Thriller on TV, even though I could watch it on YouTube on TV. It's better on DVD in my opinion. It's just an astonishing 13 minute mini-movie. I still can't believe the genius of it, even to this day.

""Billie Jean"" -brilliant. Somewhat elegant in it's simplicity as a video.

""Beat It"" -great song, dance moves and a great message.

I love ""Black or White"" but the beginning of the video is just weird with Macaulay Culkin and his ""parents"". Seeing the neighborhood kids on a stoop with MJ wasn't exactly comfortable for me but I try to watch it without thinking of what MJ was accused of and what we all know from his trials. The rest of the video, especially with the morphing of the faces from one ethnicity/sex to the other is always visually arresting though and was flawlessly done.

This is a good video investment and a nice selection for the cost.",1413676800,,1826,4.4431137724550895

He danced, he sang, he emoted.  His care about others, even if it had a political slant, was visceral.  WHen his best or 2nd best album came out (Bad) and the snobs of Harvard cited it as the worst album of the year...well I knew that some people would never convert and come over to Michael...but I did.  Like Sammy Davis, it was hard not to note his incredible skill set, his appeal to all, and his humanity.  May he rest in peace...

He invented the video clip they say with ""Thriller"" and it is true his accomplice Landis made a tremendous jewel of this song and theme. It is great music, it is great dancing and it is great pictures, filming, shooting, cinema. Most of the other clips on that DVD are good and some are fascinating. We will probably quote some still in fifty years, when we are on Mars, though he would have preferred the Moon where he could have practiced his moon walking.

1941936,3,B0000SWN4I,"There is no question about the deep and heartbreaking sadness that has shown all over the world about the tragic death of Michael Jackson. While what some of the things he had to ordeal with in the spotlight were heartbreaking, it honestly has been too easy to really forget about why he was so talented in the first place. From his songs, and his compassion to others, and all the artistry and beauty and polish he wanted in his music and his music videos will always stand and show that testiment of time. But, there are those who've never yet owned a collection of Michael Jackson's videos to call their own, and now they can but it really isn't definitive as you could expect.

Michael Jackson: Number Ones, consists of some of Michael Jacksons' biggest videos, that and the songs that shot up to the top of the charts. The DVD contains some of those videos that revolutionized the way we see music and art in the world. The collection of videos is some of Michael's best including You Rock My World, which featured Chris Tucker and the late Marlon Brando, Black Or White and Thriller which John Landis brilliantly showcased influence in Michael's music, Billie Jean that displayed the intimate white lighting floorboards, and classics like the intimate Man In The Mirror and Bad. While this is a strong sampler, there were a lot of die hard videos hard core Michael Jackson fans are dissapointed aren't here like Remember The Time, Scream which cost $7 million to make with Janet Jackson, and Leave Me Alone to just name a few, that also shot up to #1 on Billboard.

All in all, Michael Jackson was a one of a kind through the good and the bad he had to go through, but his influence on what music videos were will stand the testiments of time. If you've never seen a Michael Jackson video, than the Number Ones DVD would be a nice place to start, but not completely a definitive reflection what the late King Of Pop showcased in his music all around the wrold.

I wish the young people of today, had not listened to all the negatives and become opinionated concerning this great performer. It's too bad that they couldn't learn to be entertained without having to be cursed and told how great it is to be a thug and user of drugs, etc. WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE HIM.",1250121600,,617,4.237288135593221

It was not in real time but looked like it was sped up and was a promotional piece for the real thing. Too much special effects that didn't allow to see the magnificent dancing in detail. Youtube calls this the radio version. Had I known I was not getting the right version I would not have bought it.

Wonderful purchase if you just want the videos, which are fantastic. I'd love a behind the scenes video at some point, but that wasn't the point of this DVD.

The ONLY disappointing omission from this DVD is ""In The Closet"" which was not only a great song, but a really great video. Very adult, sexual, and broke a lot of boundaries.

Other than that, a great pickup. Definitely buy.",1248393600,,492,4.632183908045977
1942060,4,B0000SWN4I,"`Number Ones' the DVD, along with the CD of the same name is a brilliant way to introduce newcomers to the talent of Michael Jackson- the KING of Pop.  Here on this single disc we essential get all his trademark songs and their videos (Yes, I know some trademark songs didn't have videos and thus are missing from this collection).

The videos are as follows:

1. Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough - A pretty typical music video for the 70s, featuring Michael singing with interchanging green-screen backdrops.  Jackson doesn't really beginning to show his trademark showmanship and dancing until the last few moments of the video.  So, good song, but the video certainly doesn't show you how innovative the artist shall become in the future.

2. Rock With Me - More or less the same deal as the previous video, only the backgrounds are even less interesting.  Highlight is seeing a bit more full-body shots of Michael in movement than the previous video, and he gets to wear a nice glitter-jumpsuit.

3. Billie Jean - Now we are entering into trademark King of Pop material with the music video that began Michael's task of redefining the genre.  Plenty of good sets and props and special effects, including the infamous light-up sidewalk.  The film is also the first to tell a story.

4. Beat It - Another great music video, this one being for what could be Michael's best song, and features some of the best dance choreography of any of the icon's videos.  The story of this video is of Michael trying to address gang violence and preventing bloodshed as two rival gang-leaders enter into combat with knives drawn.  This is the song that would later be used by the Reagan Administration to discourage drunk driving, and earned Michael his first Government issued award.

5. Thriller - Michel Jackson's most infamous music video - the most bought/downloaded music video of all time- is presented in its entirety on this DVD.  The 13-minute mini-movie, directed by John Landis, is a landmark in entertainment that completely redefined the potential of music videos, which at one time had simply been footage of bands performing with no real point other than to combine imagery with song.  The music tells of a strange boy (Michael) who isn't all right, and proves to his date that the supernatural seems to follow him.  This sets the stage for one of the most memorable dances in modern culture as Jackson puts on his moves with a horde of the living dead!

6. Bad - Michael Jackson's follow-up album to Thriller presented this new-image of the pop star- one in which he runs around a New York Subway, in what can only be described as leather bondage gear (only children friendly).  The infamous director Martin Scorsese directed an 18-minute short film for Bad, but sadly this DVD only includes the shortened version (just the song and none of the story parts).  The dancing and performance by Jackson is still amazing.

7. The Way You Make Me Feel - A good video, though this version omits the first few, introductory minutes.  Not really a problem because the dancing and music are what you care most about for this video.

8. Man in the Mirror - One of Michael's first songs to feature mostly video-montage as opposed to an actual performance, this one using imagery of those in need and encouraging you to make a change to help others and the world.

9. Smooth Criminal - I love this song, but could they not have edited the scene from Moonwalker in order for us to see the full-length video?  This is the cheap, edited version of the original music video.  This montage feels like an advertisement for the Moonwalker movie and not like an independent piece of art at all.

10. Dirty Diana - What mostly seems like a live performance isn't too special, but the song and Jackson's stage-performance is electric.

11. Black or White - This version edits out the controversial Panther scene, but other scenes (That Home Alone kid) are still involved.  Jackson is seen dancing with members of various cultures and the song is a cry for racial equality which, with its guitar orchestrated by Slash, is one of Jackson's best songs.

12. You Are Not Alone - Not one of his better videos (features him and his first wife), but the song is one of the best love songs ever performed and Jackson (a man who was often alone) truly brings out every emotion the song is capable of.

13. Earth Song - Another song featuring footage, only this time Jackson is present.  This is a very good song and is also a cry for peace and charity around the world, allowing Jackson to once again prove his positive ideals.

14. Blood on the Dance Floor - A good video with a good song.  Doesn't stand out much compared to some of his other videos, but it is in no way a bad video.

15. You Rock My World - This is another 10+ minute video from Jackson, this time featuring guest appearances by Chris Tucker and -a rather large- Marlon Brando.  Like Smooth Criminal the film is set in a film-noir environment, but never really reaches the greatness if obviously strove for.  Still, it does have its moments, and is, like all the others, not bad- just not as good.

Overall this is a good video for new fans, but if you want ""Making-Of"" features, or ANY special features at all (this DVD has not a single extra feature) than you'd be best looking at the other MJ DVD releases, which, though more costly, will have the features you as a fan desire, as well as uncut versions of some of the above mentioned videos.",1247443200,3,5485,4.61071060762101

1942096,1,B0000SWN4I,"I'm not criticising Michael Jackson here, and the fact that there are no commentaries on these film clips or interviews with Michael, he probably has no idea this con job of a DVD collection was even released.

The whole problem and feeling that I was ripped off comes from the fact that they do not mention on the packaging anywhere and especially with the track listing, that these film clips on here are either not the versions played on TV in the 80s etc, or if they are, they have been severely edited with huge chunks cut away. There's a few still in their original version including his (and music's) greatest film clip of all time Thriller.  What's going on with the rest though?  If they need room get rid of the fillers like Blood on the Dance Floor (a song so bad even Michael struggles to dance to it and spends most of the film clip sitting on a chair).

They should have listed the tracks that aren't the real or full versions with brackets such as with Smooth Criminal (crappy low budget doesn't resemble in any way the one you remember version) Bad (shorter starts half way though actual film clip), Black and White (controversial vandalism of car, panther turning into scenes not included) etc  If they were honest and did this only the hardcore Michael Jackson fans who already have the other longer film clip versions would buy this so they have these alternative versions. The rest of the public who expect the same version they saw on their TV screens back in the 80s and so forth wouldn't feel ripped off.  Everyone would be happy!

Of course if the record company actually did that they'd make less money, but that would have been the moral thing to do.

If you can get this for $2 or something and you don't plan on getting other Jackson DVDs, it's worth getting just for Thriller. The sheer rehearsals and shooting takes it would have taken to make that masterpiece with all the zombies choreography exactly in line, leaving the ground at the same time etc is phenomenal.  DVD tracks are in chronological order of his career but you know even the menu screen is pretty average.  With no features it might as well have been a video, there's no advantage except skipping to the track you want instead of fast forwarding.

Yeah you probably want to give this a miss, don't get ripped off!

Because if you are a M.J. fan then all you should be caring about are the songs, and that's all that is on here. If you at some point like his music, or still like it, I recommend this dvd.",1123545600,10,664,3.818840579710145
1942134,5,B0000SWN4I,"Michael Jackson hasn't released any new singles recently but he's been compiling all his old hits. Having owned the other Greatest hits already, I had no surprises when watching this DVD. Some of the videos weren't really compiled together with his Greatest Hits DVD like ""Dirty Diana"" and ""Man in the Mirror"".

Even though his music has been going on and on in his albums, same stuff compiled together, you still enjoy the great beats and dance movements. Not to mention, his great voice which can really put up the beat. One great song was ""Earth Song"". It was like a movie. well, it makes you feel like it's a movie with all those war scenes and destroyed forests. It was just superb.

This DVD is still great and Michael is still legendary to me. His dance moves and voice can really boost up the spirit.",1120867200,3,808,4.527397260273973
1942135,5,B0000SWN4I,"I've read some of the negative less appreciative views and I feel they are unjustified. This DVD was released during the most traumatic situations of Michael's life. Michael's life and character were being put on display with ridicule and false accusations and A WARRANT for his arrest.

I enjoyed the simple format and the songs that I hadn't seen before on DVD: ""Dirty Diana"" and ""You Rock My World"". I especially wanted the ""Dirty Diana"" video. It didn't matter that ""YRMW"" was shortened, it was longer than the MTV version. Also, I loved this version of ""Blood On The Dance Floor"" because it showcased Michael's dancing more than the version on ""History On Film, Volume II"".

Since I have the other DVDs that show extended versions of ""Black or White"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Smooth Criminal"", ""Bad"", etc. it didn't matter that the videos were shortened on this DVD. I love the flow of the music. The songs come fast and it's MICHAEL JACKSON and that's all that matters!",1120694400,5,980,4.7251461988304095
1942136,1,B0000SWN4I,"I bought this DVD for my wife in hopes of making her Christmas bright. Needless to say, I think this is just a bad DVD collection. From the outset, it seems like this DVD was put together in an hour. No time was taken to make it interactive, with extras, or any other bonus material. Some of the videos seem grainy and are apparently different from the one's you may have seen on MTV. It really is poor workmanship. No doubt the videos are fun for a fan to watch, but look else where if quality is important to you.

This is a non-quality DVD and they should be ashamed of releasing it.

Sorry honey.",1108598400,23,600,4.208695652173913
1942137,4,B0000SWN4I,"I watched alot of this videos in my childhood to teen years and I even saw "" Another Part of me is DisneyWorld in a film called Captian Eeo. Captian Eeo was a StarWars type film in 3D and it was really cool. It was in Epcot Center before Honey we shunk ourselves. Anyway Mike is the boy. There was no one anywhere Close to Mike except Prince. I enjoyed this collection however I wish they had a dvd for the bad album. I remember seeing the bad single with wesley snipes once or twice on tv but it was rare and it may have been a countdown thing of micheals videos. I even even saw the Ben movie. I do remember the black or white long version too. I though it was cool except all the crotch grabbing but i didn't know what all the controversy was about. It was wild how he was breaking windows but the panther thing was cool. I which they had ""Leave me alone"" and Speed Demon and Another Part of me and other bad album videos. I wish they had the longer version of smooth criminal on it too. I always loved the way you make me feel. He is smooth in the video and his gestures are hilarious. Maybe the do have the bad album dvd but I haven't seen it. If they do have it I won't hesistate to get it.",1105142400,2,1196,3.9875
1942138,4,B0000SWN4I,"If you were like me and already owned the two DVDs of HIStory (Video Greatest Hits - HIStory and HIStory on Film - Volume II), you were probably disdainful when this Number Ones DVD got released.  Almost everything on Number Ones was already presented in the HIStory DVDs.

So is there buying incentive?  At bargain-bin prices, yes, because on this DVD you will find three Michael Jackson videos that range from good to fantastic, and they're not available on DVD outside of here.

""Man in the Mirror"" was a flat-out ballsy move on Jackson's part, to use only grainy stock footage and not a single shot of himself to make a video of one of his greatest hits of that time (""Man"" was one of two singles from Bad that had two weeks at #1, not one).  The song itself is a classic, thanks to one of Quincy Jones' best productions, a soul-stirring rhythm track, and Siedah Garrett's poetic, visionary lyrics, but coupled with the video's images of a world in turmoil, it's magic.  This style actually spawned another classic music video years later with Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train"", but Jackson was there first.

""Dirty Diana"" holds a special place for me because it's one of the very few Jackson performance videos.  Many people don't like the song, but I like it just fine, and Jackson and guitarist Steve Stevens were on fire in the stage show.  This video made you realize that Jackson's touring band simply kicked ass.

There's one more curio:  The short, sped-up version of ""Smooth Criminal"" intended as a broadcast alternative.  This was the first version of this classic video I ever saw, and while it doesn't convey the stunning choreography and art direction of the full version, it is a masterpiece from the editing standpoint.  If you want to do speed cutting, this is the way to do it, and at many points they even managed to sync up Jackson's hyper-sped-up footage to the tempo of the track, no small feat.  Unfortunately, both this video and ""Dirty Diana"" seem to lack for a good master source; both videos feature substantial film scratches and look far less pristine than the rest of the official videos.

There's just one more video on here not available on other DVDs, and that's ""You Rock My World"".  The song blows, and so does the video -- an expensive, self-indulgent piece whose only point of interest is its guest stars Chris Tucker, Michael Madsen and Billy Drago (Nitti in The Untouchables).  I'm not surprised this video was directed by Paul Hunter, the same man who had made Bulletproof Monk an unwatchable mess, because ""You Rock My World"" is your typical modern video with too much concept and not enough substance -- the choreography is messy, Jackson himself looks ridiculous (as he always does when he tries to act), and all the guest stars are wasted when they could've been given a chances to really colour the video with their personalities.  Even ""Liberian Girl"" (available on HIStory on Film Volume II) was better.

I got this DVD from the bargain bin, so from my end, it was still worth it just for the three videos I mentioned.  If you don't own either HIStory DVDs, I'd still recommend you get them rather than Number Ones, because the HIStory DVDs are a more comprehensive collection of Jackson's videos, and it's on those that you'll find the classic full version of ""Smooth Criminal"".  Number Ones is for the casual viewer who wants to pay less to get most of Jackson's videos.  If that's your preference, then this DVD will serve just fine.  I'm still waiting for them to put Moonwalker out on DVD, though.  That live version of ""Come Together"" and the hilarious ""Bad"" spoof ""Badder"" (featuring kids playing the punk roles!) are still only available on Moonwalker, and it's about time they resurfaced.",1101168000,154,3743,4.731895223420647
1942139,4,B0000SWN4I,"I really liked this DVD.  It was a good price, and had a good collection of some awesome music videos.  The only reason I gave it four stars, is because there were a couple good videos that were left out, but that's why you buy the other volumes.

The videos showed on this DVD however, were really great.  They are quality videos to watch whenever.  My favorites are of course the most popular, Thriller, Bad, and Black and White.  I was a little disapointed that there wasn't much moonwalking, but it really showed Michael at some of the good times of his life.  He was so talented.",1100649600,,584,4.401869158878505
1942140,5,B0000SWN4I,"This compilation is very much like 1995's HISTORY. The only original tracks are ONE MORE CHANCE(not to be confused with the Jacksons' recording from their 1984 VICTORY album),and a live version of BEN,Michael Jackson's solo debut hit from '72. Some of the tracks have been slightly edited from their original album versions. One of them was DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH from 1979's OFF THE WALL. The intro is not heard on this album(MJ briefly speaks). This album has four different cover concepts. The photos were taken,respectively,in 1979,1987,the early 90's and sometime this decade. A must for all MJ fans.",1094428800,5,613,5.079207920792079
1942161,2,B0000SWN4I,"First of all, where's Smooth Criminal? The best of all MJ's videos was disfigured, distorted, ripped off... I just bought the DVD because of that masterpiece of magical dancing! It was just a simple thing to do: getting that part out of the Moonwalker movie and injecting into this DVD! What have they done?!! Second, why not all the videos? Should we still depend on VHS old rags? Third, if not all the videos, at least the best ones, right? So where's ""Ghost""? That is a masterpiece! Where's ""Another Part of Me""? That one is also amazing. They even play it on a huge screen in Disneyland. Where's the final part of ""Black or White"" (the one he changes into a panther and dances in a dark street)? At least five minutes were cut out!! That's why it deserves only two stars. We, old fans, deserved a little more.",1087344000,5,813,4.4630872483221475

1942163,4,B0000SWN4I,"I like every video on here cept for 2. That was the Smooth Criminal one and the Blood on the dance floor video. Naturally, I don't like BOTDF but the Smooth Criminal was sped up too fast to catch a glimsp of his magic. oh well!",1077235200,2,227,3.9565217391304346
1942164,5,B0000SWN4I,"...but this is not Michael's best DVD.  There are no behind the scenes, making of the video extras, and many of the videos have bee overly edited.
Noticibly absent is the controversial ""panther"" part at the end of ""Black or white"" when Michael breaks car windows, grabs his croch (ALOT) and turns into a black panther.  THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE VIDEO!  It showcases some of Michael's best footwork and dance moves.  (you can see it on ""Dangerous: The Short Films"" and ""HIStory on Film, Volume I.""
Fortunately ""Thriller"" is the full version (how can you cut the greatest short film of all time?-- YOU CAN'T!)
""Smooth Criminal"" video sucks!  That's right it SUCKS!  It's not the amazing dance sequence seen in ""Moonwalker"" where Michael dances, in my opioion, his best EVER in a short film.  But it is a slow motion, weird, cut-up, sequence of shots from the entire 40 minute ""Smooth Criminal"" video seen in ""Moonwalker.""  Trust me, I am Michael Jackson's biggest fan, and its no good.
Also, I wish they would have put the ""Moonwalker"" version of ""Man in the Mirror.""  Instead they have the mainstream one, a collection of inspirational real-life footage; its good, but I like to see Michael perform with all the passion he does in the ""Moonwalker"" version.
The only videos I'd say are missing are ""Jam,"" ""They Don't Care About Us"" and ""Remember the Time.""  But all the other MAJOR videos are in there.  (You can see these on Michael's other DVD's.)
I am so happy, they put ""Dirty Diana"" and ""Rock My World"" in this DVD, as you can't see them on any other Michael Jackson DVD.  And they are SPECTACULAR videos.  ""Rock my world"" features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando and Michael does some realy cool dance moves.  ""Dirty Diana"" is a powerful video replicating a live performance.  Personally, I had only been able to see these videos a couple of times, when they came on MTV and VH1.  Now I can watch again and again.
You will definitly LOVE this DVD as it has all (or most of) the Number One hit Videos.
I think ""Dangerous the Short Films"" and ""HIStory Continues: Past Present Future, Volume II"" are better collections of Michael's short films.
Michael Jackson is still the King of Pop, and so it gets 5 stars.",1075507200,18,2214,4.60969387755102

Anyone who has ever liked any Michael Jackson song absolutly needs to have this DVD! It goes from the early Michael solos that put him on the map to the songs that will forever be imprinted on our minds. It touches the soul with ""Man In The Mirror"", and makes us laugh with ""You Rock My World"". It turns back the clock with ""Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough"", and shows us modern day problems with ""Earth Song"". This music compilation will explore all emotions of all who watch it.

This collection would have been given a sure-fire 5 stars but unfortunately the quality of this DVD does not reach the standard. There are no special features and the video version of 'Smooth Criminal' is a disgrace. Its a reminder that Michael Jackson's videos were definately ground breaking at the time and spectacular in every sense of the word.
