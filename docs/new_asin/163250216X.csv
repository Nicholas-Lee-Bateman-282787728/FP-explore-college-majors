While it could be classified as shibori since it is a form of resist dyeing It is not the Woven Shibori that you might be thinking of.  There is a huge amount of warping information here and it is very interesting and clearly presented.  There is not as much on the dyeing portion so personally I did not get what I wanted.  That said, the instructor is very clear and there is a great deal of good information.",1490659200,,498,4.369565217391305
