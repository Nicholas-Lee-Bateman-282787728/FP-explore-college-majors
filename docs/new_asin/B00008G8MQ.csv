7982850,1,B00008G8MQ,"Plot hole-ridden disaster of a movie; hilarious for all the wrong reasons.  I enjoyed this immensely, but then -- I am easily amused.",1393891200,,133,4.782608695652174
7982851,4,B00008G8MQ,"I enjoyed the film, though it did show its age.  You have Maxwell Caulfield playing a mega bad cop, who will not let anything get in his way.  Paul Johansson is a witness with a video camera who ends up going on the run because of what he has on film.  Fast paced and not sure whats going to happen next.  If you can get a copy, do as you will enjoy it.",1265673600,,353,3.7945205479452055
