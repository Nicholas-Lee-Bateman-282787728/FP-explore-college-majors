2680960,5,B000JYW65Y,"I had heard this Brit TV show was very popular over the pond, and watched a few episodes on A and E, and was immediately hooked.  The acting, the story lines, the ""catch you sleeping"" at the end makes this show refreshing and fun to watch.  It seems on USA crime-con-action shows you see a recycled actor(s) from a cancelled show and it is hard to make their characters credible.  Robert Vaughn, formerly the Man From U.N.C.L.E. is the cherry on top of the sundae as well.  Solid show and looking forward to Season Two on disc and hopefully season three real soon.  You cannot go wrong with this DVD colection to anyone's library.",1169164800,5,630,4.491228070175438
2680961,4,B000JYW65Y,"For those who enjoyed the first season of Hustle, the second season cannot disappoint. Taking up where the first season left off, with our favorite crew of grifters returning to London after a holiday, they immediately jump into a new six-episode space of capers that are even more clever, charming and humorous than the previous season's. Here's you'll find the crew getting in on a comic book art auction, attempt to swindle Stacie's rake of an ex-husband, unite a former gangster with his long lost ""son,"" and even take a stab at stealing the Crown Jewels.

In all of these, and more, you cna expect the requisite twist, turns, and jokes, but the writing and acting seem to ahve been ratcheted up for this season, and everything is firing on all cylanders. Some of the plots can become a bit predictable, but in the end the twists, turns, and resolutions are brilliant and mind-bending, making this one of the most satisfying television programs I've seen in a long time. Not to be missed.",1189900800,2,992,4.734104046242774
2680962,5,B000JYW65Y,"This show is awesome! Although eash season is only 6 episodes. Each show is fresh and new. From the producers of MI-5 (Spooks) This cast of Characters work well together. Mickey Bricks, Danny Blue & the Crew keep you guessing, and laughing. Awesome writing! Can't wait for the next season (season 4) to be released.",1186617600,,315,4.745454545454545
2680963,5,B000JYW65Y,"The acting is great, the writing is the best there is, the set production, editing, everything about this series is flawless.  You will never catch a collar buttoned in one scene and unbuttoned the next.  Most importantly, I'm sombody who always, always knows the plot ending before it happens, but Hustle has surprised me, delightfully, more than once.  The stories always make sense.  They simply take you on an enjoyable little trip to the Hustle players' world, where none of your everyday problems exist.",1184457600,,509,5.023809523809524
2680964,5,B000JYW65Y,"Hustle season two is just as fun as season one.  The style is evolving a little bit, but still has the freeze frame shots and characters looking directly into the camera to let you know something is up.  The stories are always fun as are the cons.  Most of the time I figure out the double cross, since their is almost always a double cross, but oddly this does not make the show any less enjoyable.  The characters are just so great to watch that figuring stuff out doesn't matter.  That is not to say that the story or writing is bad.  Both are great, but if you watch a lot of con movies you will see some things coming.  If you love cons you have to watch this show!",1184371200,,670,4.107692307692307
2680965,5,B000JYW65Y,"Britain's finest team of long con artists are back for another oh-too-brief season of grifting.  The second season is even better than the excellent first season.  Highlights include: a cop strong-arms Eddie the bartender into spying on the team; Stacy's ex-husband makes a reappearence; and the team decides to heist the Crown Jewels.  This show keeps you on your toes: the dialogue is fast and witty, the cons are entertaining and clever, and things are rarely as they seem to be.  The free-wheeling scripts often break down the fourth wall to address the TV viewer directly to great effect.  I look forward to Season 3.",1181865600,,622,4.885714285714286
2680966,5,B000JYW65Y,"I started watching this show while vacationing in Europe. I quickly fell in love with it. It goes to prove that BBC programing is much more entertaining than ours. Watch 5 of the best long con artists swindle the greedy and corrupt out of millions, because remember the first rule of the

long con is you can't con an honest man!",1178409600,,329,4.39344262295082
2680967,5,B000JYW65Y,Hustle is a great show. Each episode is more like a mini-movie than just a television show. Can't wait for Season 3!,1176508800,,116,4.318181818181818
2680968,5,B000JYW65Y,"A very witty series and premise.  I ususally loathe any English programs, but this caught my fancy while watching it on Bravo.  I have seen most of these episodes, but still enjoy watching them again.  I bought the DVD because my high school son asked for it.  Now his friends come over and they watch them.  The cons are smart (kind of like an abridged version of Oceans 11).  He already wants season 3 which he says is available at Amazon-UK.",1174608000,,444,4.419753086419753
2680969,5,B000JYW65Y,"I am so glad I found this show and can't wait until more shows are filmed.

I would recommend Hustle to anyone who enjoys plot twists and turns. It's fun to see Robert Vaughn back on a tv series since I was a big U.N.C.L.E. fan from the 1960's. This ensemble cast works very well together and needs to be recognized for their talents.",1173312000,2,334,4.21875
2680970,5,B000JYW65Y,"HUSTLE is serious entertainment.  If you're new to the BBC series that's just now hitting the DVD collection scene here in the United States, you're going to get caught flat-footed by the whizzing plots, blistering dialogue, and quick-change-artists practicing their craft right before your eyes.

If you've had the good fortune to see Season 1, you're going to be sitting on the edge of your seat, never taking your eyes off the players.  Either way, Mickey Bricks and his long con crew are going to charm your socks off.

My wife and I favor the BBC ""bloodless"" crime stories.  She's never quite developed my taste for hardcore private eye movies, but we've found common meeting ground in several of the BBC offerings (such as the elegant FOYLE'S WAR and the witty MURDER IN SUBURBIA and others).  I introduced her to the series with this season and we sat and tried to figure out how the con worked as the team went to work.  I envy her because she still has Season 1 to watch.

HUSTLE Season 2 is terrific entertainment suitable for anyone in the family--although there are occasional swear words and sexual innuendo that probably bumps it up to a PG rating.  The fast pace, great dialogue, and fully realized characters are great fun to watch.  With an electric mix of fun, vengeance, action, danger, and the magic of con artists, HUSTLE Season 2 is great entertainment package with replay value.",1171756800,9,1401,4.75206611570248
