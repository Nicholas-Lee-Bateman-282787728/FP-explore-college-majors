8560958,5,B00B1LQB1O,"Remember how a cartoon always came with a movie when you went to a theater? And do you remember how good some of those cartoons were? Well they were made for a very diverse audience and would have everyone laughing, all the way from serious movie critics right down to young kids. They were just great. Well, I now have a young boy (4 1/2) and his mother feeds him some of the modern cartoons for entertainment. He likes them. I, however, got the idea of giving him exposure to some of the cartoons of my  childhood. They're readily available and are downright cheap. I pick them up off the Wal-Mart five-dollar rack. My latest acquisition was a disc called ""Tom and Jerry's Musical Mayhem."" It's a wonderful DVD!

""Musical Mayhem"" is a Tom and Jerry collection of cartoons having to do with music, in one way or another. The music ranges anywhere from Classical to Dance-jazz to early Hip-Hop. It's hilarious, and makes for pleasant listening too. My boy likes music and just loves this disc. I played it for him almost as soon as it arrived. He was laughing hilariously and you could tell that he was enjoying the music too. Much later in the day I offered to show him a Looney Tunes that I had also purchased at the same time. He said no. He wanted to watch the Tom and Jerry again. Well, it's just that kind of disc. I'm laughing just as much as the boy, maybe more.

The disc has a total of seven cartoons. I'm not sure of their ages and see no point in looking them up. The first cartoon (The Cat Concerto) has a note on it that it was the Academy Award winner for Best Cartoon in 1946. The others are probably younger and, judging from the musical styles presented, probably range up to about the early 80s. The artwork and animation is excellent on all of them, but the colors are  brighter and more vivid on the latest episodes. The sound is quite good and becomes more dramatic on the later episodes. In all, the DVD is very well done. Have fun watching.

8560959,2,B00B1LQB1O,"Yea, don't waist your money getting this because it's another family friendly Tom & Jerry DVD with only 1 disc and only 7 cartoons. The single disc Looney Tunes DVDs from early last year (which are ""The Best of Bugs Bunny"" and ""Looney Tunes Unleashed"") were really bad since they had only 3 cartoons, this one is only the 2nd weakest DVD release. It will contain:

*The Cat Concerto (1950)
*Saturday Evening Puss (1950)
*Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl (1950)
*Johann Mouse (1953, last Academy Award Winner)
*Carmen Get It! (1962, Gene Deitch era)
*Rock N' Rodent (1967, Chuck Jones era)
*DJ Jerry (from ep. 24 of Tom & Jerry Tales)

As you will notice it has another new-to-DVD Gene Deitch Tom & Jerry cartoon and at least only one cartoon from an episode of Tom & Jerry Tales. But I would stay away from this and just wait for the second volume of Tom & Jerry Golden Collection instead.",1358899200,8,892,4.5
