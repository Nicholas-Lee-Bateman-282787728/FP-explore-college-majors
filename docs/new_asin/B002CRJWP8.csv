8364363,5,B002CRJWP8,"Not the original lineup and not my favorite, but the material brings the main trajectory of this magnificent music of death metal band. The material is very well captured and edited. And as a bonus brings a great documentary, plus a booklet full of photos.",1363219200,,256,4.711111111111111
8364364,5,B002CRJWP8,"You will find yourself wondering:""where did Matti Karki get an Autopsy shirt that big?""...as you find youself drooling at the crushing heaviness that is, and always has been, Dismember!  DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR: if you are a longtime Dismember fan, get this and DO NOT allow yourself to read the setlist.  You will be very pleasantly surprised as it unfolds, especially toward the latter part of the show!  Sounds great and looks great to me; have no fear that perhaps Steve Harris edited it for that exciting yet nauseating ""Death on the Road"" treatment...the shots and angles are pretty standard and not baffling.  I'm sure some tech gumbies may find faults with the picture and sound, but for a plain ol' MeTal fan, it served the purpose with gusto.  The extra ""documentary"" thing is a lot of laughs and informative, too.  I was amazed to find that Dismember usually makes up the setlist right before the show (whereas most bands play the same setlist for whatever tour their on night after night).",1270425600,,998,4.773255813953488
