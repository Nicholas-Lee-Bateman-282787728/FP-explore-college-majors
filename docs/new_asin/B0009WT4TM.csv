I don't buy instruction just to hear how good he can burn thru these, I want to learn  All these LL vids would be so much better with some type of looping option",1486857600,,368,3.8666666666666667
8068802,5,B0009WT4TM,"Awesome!! Is a perfect description for this video!! There are actually more than 50 licks. If my memory serves me right about 76!! This is a wide spectrum of licks from various styles of Rock. From basic penatonic licks to major licks and beyond, this dvd should keep you busy at least 10 months. If you can learn and apply these licks in a shorter time frame your better than me!! Arpeggio licks are short!! It would have been better to have longer runs. I guess they were keeping with the theme of easier licks. The licks are basic for arpeggios!! And rate from Beg.-adv. for the rest. If your building a library of licks this is an very good start. Adv. guitarist's should stay away there is nothing unusual that you haven't seen before. Only complaint is there is no instruction on how to put these together. Trial and error is the rule here!! Is this worth the money? Yes!! A perfect 10 for bang for buck!! Buy now!! I'm a working musician!!",1315958400,,946,4.442528735632184
