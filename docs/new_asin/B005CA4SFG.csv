Gianni Coscia and Gianluigi Trovesi are hilarious.  Just watching all these people (Manfred Eicher included) is breathtaking.

Can you tell that I love this video?",1325116800,8,316,5.24
4652321,5,B005CA4SFG,"If you enjoy ECM recordings, this is a must view.  Eicher's musical philosophy is on full display here.  It is clear that his contributions to the recorded performances are every bit as significant as the artists'  original conceptions.  And the artists have little trouble accepting that.  Nik Bartsch's Ronin is the most concrete examples. Eicher patiently explains his suggestions and the band members completely get it as soon as they hear it.  It's a great documentary.",1322179200,11,474,5.171052631578948
4652322,5,B005CA4SFG,"In a 1994 interview, Manfred Eicher stated, ""I started listening to this music with a recording of Miles Davis -
""Kind of Blue"", actually - and that led to Bill Evans with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian. I realized that these
were very good recorded examples of improvised music. The music I heard had a great originality and a gen-
uine impact on my musical thinking. But the aesthetic of bringing this music to our ears in the full range of
overtones was not happening. There was this interactive feel in improvised music all the time, but very often
it didn't come through on record. It's very difficult to record jazz - to get all this intensity in a transparent way.
Since I was a musician myself, I thought that - using my skills and ability to listen to music, to become an ac-
tive, involved listener - I would be able to transfer it to another aesthetic."" The new dvd, ""Sounds and Silence"",
is a beautiful documentary film about the extraordinary man and genius behind ECM Records (the coolest music
label on the planet), Manfred Eicher. As with so many other fans, I got into ECM way back in the early 70's and
became a totally addicted ECM vinyl freak - I could not buy these things fast enough. I have since converted
90% of THAT collection to cd, and continue to add newer ECM releases when I can. I realized early on what a
fabulous label ECM is, and that an incredible vision and mind was behind it. It's not everyday one gets to see
a TRUE living genius at work - ""Sounds and Silence"" gives us a glimpse of Manfred Eicher at work in the more
RECENT years of ECM over a five year time span. Those looking for a film about him and his label from the early
years and beyond (with all those ECM artists we all know and love so well) will not find it here, although I would
love to see a true BIOGRAPHICAL film made about Eicher and ECM - hopefully this will happen soon. Regardless,
""Sounds and Silence"" is a haunting and gorgeous film that anybody who is familiar with ECM and Eicher should
see.  I have well over 500 ECM items in my collection. Several of the artists profiled on this dvd were totally new
to me - I already have several orders in for their cd's. In the same 1994 interview Eicher offered, ""To survive for
25 years as an independent label - entirely independent, not supported and not subsidized by the major compan-
ies or by anything else, and not having a pop line that generates a lot of sales, and to do so-called risky projects -
we had to work on a very limited budget from the beginning, with only a few people in the office. It's a very, very
hard job, and the price for that is very high - in private life, in health, in all kinds of situations. It is a very demand-
ing situation. But it's worth all this, because a certain passion is driving me to do what I am doing. That's the only
motive. My longing tells me that I should somehow find music that is still to be found.""  ECM has been a VERY im-
portant part of my own life and inspiration for a LONG time and continues to be - ""The Most Beautiful Sound Next
To Silence."" Thanks, Manfred.

P.S.  For even more insight into the brilliant mind and thinking of Manfred
Eicher and the ECM label, check out the you-tube video, ""A Conversation
With Manfred Eicher"", in which he's interviewed by jazz critic and writer
Gary Giddins in front of a live audience at City University in New York and
Eicher shows us why he and ECM have been so successful from day one -
SO cool, mannered, intelligent, and cultured. At one point, Eicher reduces
Giddins with ONE line when Giddins suggests ECM had alot of LUCK (!!!!!)
with its success in the early years. Giddins comes over as simple-minded,
unprepared, vague, and even insulting in comparison to the incredibly so-
phisticated and brilliant Eicher, who often looks somewhat puzzled and un-
comfortable with Giddin's blunt questions and poor style - embarrassing.
Our deepest apologies, Manfred, for such amateurish treatment.",1319846400,13,3956,4.459944751381215
4652323,3,B005CA4SFG,"Hello my Friends!  Do not buy this if you're into the ECM jazz scene. When I was in high school, a friend came over to my house with ""Solstice"" and ""Witchi-Ti-Tao."" I was hooked for life.
Ralph Towner, Eberhard Weber, Jon Christensen, Terje Rypdal, Jan Garbarek, soon became my biggest influences. L Shankar, Nana Vasconcelos, Marilyn Mazur, Trilok Gurtu, so many great jazz artists on one label. This video is mostly about producer Manfred Eicher. His record label ECM and ways of listening to music. It's mostly Manfred in orchestral settings.
In ""Sounds and Silence"" there's a nice clip with Marilyn Mazur, some Anouar Brahem, and a little bit of Garbarek in an orchestral setting. This is not the ECM I know. Peter Guyer and Norbert Weidmer paint a lop-sided picture of Manfred. I was disappointed with the video because I'm mostly familiar with Manfred's great work in jazz and world music and there's little of that in this film.",1316476800,22,935,4.84375

8465016,5,B005CA4SFG,"Because I'm pretty ignorant of audio technology, this film was a surprising, delightful  introduction to the art of recording brilliance. Eicher's collaborations with composers and musicians are role models for friends and lovers:  enchanted, respectful, tender, attentive solicitations of the best in the other. In this film, image, music and narration draw you out of the ordinary world.",1453248000,,389,5.689655172413793

8465018,5,B005CA4SFG,I have been listening to ECM recordings for years and see the background from how their recording quality and the artists interact.

8465020,5,B005CA4SFG,"This film is a chance to watch a diverse group of musical artists at work in many settings.  Some are musicians, some are technicians, some are composers, and one is an extraordinary producer.  The film is not encyclopaedic, but in a surprisingly short time, the viewer can get a sense of what makes the recording label ECM special, between a set of brilliant artists with distinctive personalities and a ring leader who knows just what to amplify.  Although Eicher's portfolio spans four decades, this film is a snapshot from a short period of his recent work.  For those of us who enjoy travel, it is scattered across multiple countries and  continents, with some very playful photography.  In the balance between information and art, Wiedmer and Guyer err in the direction of art, and they achieve the intrigue of an ECM album cover.  Enjoy this as an engaging video, rather than a history lesson.  Consider it even as shrewd advertising, since it exposed me to unfamiliar newer ECM artists I've subsequently grown to enjoy.  Both the video and the soundtrack of Sounds and Silence get about as much play in my house as any ECM album, which is a lot.  The soundtrack is on my frequent play list.  The video is on my must see list to show visitors, who reliably seem impressed with the art, the music and the relationships.  If only we could all enjoy our work like that!",1429401600,4,1373,4.675
8465021,4,B005CA4SFG,I love ECM..have been addicted since the late 70's. I enjoyed this film BUT I felt a bit cheated as it failed to feature many of the artists who have made ECM famous as well as the finest recording engineer on the planet Jan Erik Kongshaug.,1409702400,,240,4.239130434782608

8465023,4,B005CA4SFG,"I used buy ECM records on vinyl by the crate. I had so  many lps, I could hardly walk to my bed. Eventually, I had to sell them just to clear out the clutter.  The better recordings were issued on CD, so I retained my love of the ECM sound through the CD reissues. The thing about ECM was they had this sound which is almost enigmatic to describe. At  one level you could listen on an ambient level and just let the music flow through you. Or in listening closer, there was a detail of the sound that was intricate and palitable. Whether you were listening to the screaching guitar of Terje Rypdal., or the sacred sound of Arvo Part, The sound was always magnified. I think this DVD will give you an understanding of the artistic producer Manfred Eicher. He is a lover of sound and music. I would have liked this  more if they covered some of the artists I followed on ECM. As is, they seemed to touch on the more classical artists in the roster of ECM artists. Another aspect of ECM records was the unique photos and artwork that graced their covers. This topic was not discussed. I can actually see more documentaries of Manfred and his label being made. This one is a good place to start, but I think it is the tip of the iceberg in  a truly complete ECM documentary",1363392000,8,1269,4.270833333333333
8465024,2,B005CA4SFG,"SOUNDS AND SILENCE is a documentary by Peter Guyer and Norbert Wiedmer about the jazz and classical record label ECM and its founder Manfred Eicher, who travels the world to personally produce most of the recordings. ECM artists which appear in the documentary include Anja Lechner, Dino Saluzzi, Arvo Prt, Tnu Kaluste, Eleni Karaindrou, Gianluigi Trovesi, Marilyn Mazur, Nik Brtsch, Jean-Louis Matinier, Anouar Brahem, Franois Couturier, Kim Kashkashian and Jan Garbarek,

I'd certainly consider myself a fan of the ECM label and have positively reviewed a large number of ECM recordings here on Amazon. However, even for me this documentary was a frustrating, often baffling experience. We get only a small amount of information. Most of the documentary consists of street scenes, which I guess represent Eicher's globetrotting, and musicians' rehearsals with all the stop-starts and playing that the musicians immediately dismiss as could-have-been-better. Many of the musicians only briefly appear, and don't even have dialogue. Except for three or four lines about his motivations, Eicher is a complete enigma. He's omnipresently watching the recording sessions but rarely says anything. Perhaps the filmmaker intended this, but SOUNDS AND SILENCE seems to delight in mystery to the point where viewers wanting to *learn* something are left unsatisfied.

The editing is haphazard as well. Anja Lechner is shown for about 5 seconds and then we move on to someone completely different for a while. At one odd moment we jump to Anouar Brahem mentioning his project to film Lebanese intellectuals presenting their opinons after the 2006 war, saying that Lebanon is a vibrant democracy that others are trying to destroy (who? Israelis? despotic Arab regimes?) and claiming that ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"" (is he talking about Hezbollah?). It's never made clear if this project has anything to do with the ECM label, and what Manfred Eicher thinks about it.

About the only thing I found worthwhile about this documentary is that it underscores how ECM recordings present one man's personal vision of the music and do not intend to capture whatever the audience would have heard at a live performance. For example, Eicher's rare instructions to the technicians involve amplification of aspects a live audience might not have heard. Also, there's a brief scene where Eicher sits in the office with a graphic designer, trying to choose a photograph for a record cover. That gives you a vague idea of where the label's famous visual aesthetic comes from. But otherwise, this documentary sucks.",1335571200,12,2617,5.301204819277109
