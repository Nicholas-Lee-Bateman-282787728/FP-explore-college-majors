111098,4,0790737647,"This movie gets major play and is one of the few DVD's I will search for. I feel no affinity for anyone in this film, but there are a number of character classes that cover the basics of human nature, and how 4-5 people can be so self-involved, and immersed in their lives, or really planning for when they get a life, that they had to be reminded to enjoy life, and don't squander it. Our time is precious, and many surprises befall a person over the course of a lifetime, if you get a full one.

Leaves of Grass has been at my bedside since I first heard the words, and will be e're more. How many in life married the face? Or wasted university years? This movie is great practice for life, so that you may navigate it, ""With Honors"".",1459728000,2,736,4.183098591549296

This could have been a great film considering that it has a talented cast like Pesci who happens to be an Academy Award winner,it was just too bad that it has a somewhat a simplistic screenplay. It was contrived and clichd as the viewer could have seen how the relationship with the homeless man and the students would turn out,how the conflicts will be resolved and the conclusion that came to happens to be no surprise at all. Added to that,the cast wasn't able to elevate it due to average performances despite having being talented and the direction was far from being wonderful.",1415664000,,791,4.65

111144,3,0790737647,"WITH HONORS wears its heart on its sleeve: the tale of a hobo Simon Wilder (Joe Pesci) who enters the lives of four self-absorbed Harvard University learners and changes them forever. The contrast between Wilder and egghead Monty (Brendan Fraser) is established early on: although lacking any formal education, Wilder understands everything about life; Monty has a great educational future but knows nothing about life.  As the action unfolds, so the odd couple become attached to one another - so much so, in fact, that Wilder's passing at the end of the film is a major event in the learners' lives.

While the plot is a familiar one, the film is redeemed by two strong central performances: Pesci clearly enjoys himself in the role of Wilder (with the catchphrase ""O boy, O boy, O boy!"" while Fraser offers a sympathetic interpretation of Monty.  The film contains an interesting cameo from Gore Vidal as an opinionated professor, so fond of his own self-image that he seldom listens to anyone else.  However Wilder reduces him to speechlessness with a mixture of verbal wit and homespun philosophy.  Even great writers (sorry, professors) can be silenced by so-called 'ordinary' people.

The film makes use of some stunning Harvard locations, with good use of the changing seasons to suggest different moods.  Quite enjoyable, despite its predictability.",1362441600,,1358,5.117647058823529

111166,3,0790737647,"This predictable story attempts to be deep, but never makes it past the shallow end. Pesci's great truths to the youth are simplistic, and presented to the students in uninteresting undramatic ways. The students buy into him...only because the script tells them to. I think even junior college students wouldn't take Pesci or his rantings seriously. It's a nice premise, but the script doesn't have the weight necessary. My guess is that the scripwriter was relatively young, and couldn't be expected to present the great essential truths learned from a life lived, when he himself hasn't made that journey yet. A suggestion: ""The Paper Chase"" with Timothy Bottoms and John Houseman...a much better, satisfying, and involving film about growing wiser while attending Harvard.",1178582400,,775,5.308943089430894

111168,2,0790737647,"To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his ""wise"" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character.",1165190400,2,482,4.938271604938271
111169,5,0790737647,"... a life education, that is. Brendan Fraser has never been one to take on a role with any substance or complexity and this film is certainly not a divergence. I don't begrudge the guy for going for the paycheck -- and he must not begrudge himself either because it seems it's all he does: Dudley Dooright, George of the Jungle, The Looney Tunes Movie, Mummies I & II, Monkeybone, Bedazzled, The Scout, Airheads, Encino Man, etc.

In this earnest to the point of humiliation film, a homeless man throws Fraser's thesis into a furnance. (And as an earlier reviewer pointed out) Let's forget the fact that Fraser is smart enough to get into Harvard but not smart enough to back up or copy his thesis. Because if we were to allow logic into our minds then our hearts would follow. See what I'm saying.

What is an uncanny coincidence is that I brought a homeless man into my thesis defense. Regrettably the man could not enlighten my professors, but he did leave a funny smell in the room after he had asked them all for spare change. This was not one of those ""noble homeless"" that Pesci portrays here so unconvincingly. It was one of the mentally challenged people whose very existence, is filled with desperation and indignity. And the worst part was that he bit Doc Ahern, took a whole chunk of his ear out.

I only hope this movie does not damage all the progress that the homeless have made in this country. If the average citizen believes that the only thing holding back the homeless is their ""live for today, make yourself happy"" attitude, then we're in worse shape than I ever thought.",1147219200,,1593,4.543554006968641
111170,3,0790737647,"I couldn't help being impressed by the favorable comments some of the ""citizen reviewers"" (as I like to refer to us) have posted below.  I sometimes write reviews in a kind of pseudo-professional mode--and sometimes do just the opposite.  But it's always interesting to me to see the disparity (and occasional congruity) between the views of the pros (for which nowadays you only have to consult ""rottentomatoes.com"")and us amateurs (as exemplified here).

But when I am not playing critic, I sometimes recall playing actor, artist, singer or actor myself (done the amateur thing in all of those realms too) and become perhaps a little more appreciative of and grateful for the ""non-professional"" point of view.  Sometimes the non-professional audience ""gets"" the point of a work more readily and more completely than the more jaded critical corps.  I can't help but think of how the filmmakers and the cast members would appreciate some of the kinder comments posted below.  It's nice to know that your work touched somebody.

Which is not to imply that WITH HONORS (the movie I am ostensibly reviewing here) is a particularly good film.  It really isn't.  The filmmakers have their hearts in the right place, but this story of an ambitious young grad student learning some valuable life lessons at the hands of street wise and plain old philosophically wise middle aged bum (Joe Pesci) is fairly predictable and not much to write home (or to write a thesis) about.

Forgive the joke.  It is, of course, a college thesis written by college whiz Montgomery Kessler (Frazer) that serves as the keye plot device in this film.  Young Monty loses his sole copy of his academic masterpiece (has this genius never heard of FLOPPIES?) only to find that it about to become kindling for the proud,unbowed and self-avowed bum, Simon Wilder (Pesci), who generously offers NOT to burn the young scholar's work in exchange for a bit of help in the food, clothing and shelter department.  Montgomery is at first appalled.  But you can pretty much guess what's going to happen next.  The natural resentment and qualified disgust Monty feels toward Simon will soon enough give way to friendship and respect.  And this nose-to-the-grindstone academic noodge will soon learn about *LIFE* from this graduate of the School of Hard Knocks.

Of course, almost no sooner does their friendship take root than it is discovered that Simon also has a fatal disease (asbestiosis, which has its roots in Simon's years in the Merchant Marine--so, you see, he is a victim of the system).  He will die--we will soon see--tragically rejected by his own family, but nonetheless embraced by his new-found family (Monty and his housemates).

It's a variation on a theme older than the movies.  I note one reviewer defends the film by noting that there ARE some surprises.  There may be, but not enough to elevate the film into the ""true original"" category. But it's reasonably well acted, well photographed and competently directed (not really a bad beginning for first time dramatic director Alek Kesheshian--whose previous work included the Madonna doc TRUTH OR DARE).  And while I don't think it deserves kudos, every film finds its audience (well, not EVERY film, but a good many), and for younger viewers who haven't been brought up on a steady diet of hokum, it could even be a refreshing change of pace from their actual steady diet of special effects laden action films.

Sometimes we older viewers tend to forget that our ""old hat"" may be new for SOMEBODY.  This is a film with heart, and that counts for something.  As fans of WITH HONORS get older--and perhaps a little more jaded themselves--they might even find that they understand and even begin to agree with the criticisms levied against this sort of film.  They will likely see that a film can be simultaneously heartwarming AND manipulative.  But they will probably still look back at it affectionately.  And they may re-watch it (perhaps furtively). At that point, they might start to consider it something of a guilty pleasure.  Actually, it's nothing to feel particularly guilty about.  It's an OK film with an OK message and some good acting.

That too counts for something.",1143504000,9,4211,4.947368421052632

111172,4,0790737647,"WITH HONORS is a thoughtful and well done little ""slice of life"" with a moral we've all heard before:  do what makes you happy and take time to live your life.  Director Alex Keshishian and screenwriter William Mastrosimone, however, don't knock you over the head with its theme and/or morals.  There are some scenes where you're expecting the probable to happen and they don't:  e.g., after Simon cooks Gorky, the rooster, you expect his master to be furious---when Simon finally meets up with the son he abandoned, you expect some kind of tearful reunion----and you certainly think Monty is going to graduate with honors.  The end results of these scenes, however, avoid the usual cliche.  Joe Pesci is delightfully understated in his role, and although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable, you understand his pains and shortcomings; Brendan Fraser starts out pretty snooty and insufferable but as he matures in his relationship with both Pesci and Moira Kelly (who is delightful as Courtney), Fraser becomes a more sympathetic character; Patrick Dempsey adds some lightweight humor as Gorky's master, and Josh Hamilton eschews the usual pain in the butt role with a believable and touching change of heart.

The movie is definitely manipulative, but its heart is in the right place and its cast takes it seriously, so it ends up being a charming little film with a strong reaffirmation of the human spirit.",1111881600,13,1417,5.02991452991453

Anyone could predict the outcome; the two fall for each other (in a dissapointingly heterosexual way) and-believe it or not-Joe Pesci is revealed to have a critical illness just as the two become close.

I might not have gotten the whole message out of this movie, or even what I was supposed to see, but I saw that quote.  Monty (a Harvard student) was comsumed with writing his thesis and once he lost it he thought his life was over.  After spending time with Simon (a homeless man) in order to get his thesis back, he saw that there was more to life than a thesis.  Monty learned not to take life too seriously and enjoy what was around him that he didn't see in the past.  Another thing I learned was that in life you have to roll with the punches.  Monty had his whole life figured out but as soon as his computer crashed (something as simple as that) his whole plan for his life was out the window.

This showed me that Monty wasn't as selfish as I thought, because he cared for Simon and did everything for him, including putting his thesis on the back burner.  This movie was based on the true value of friendship, and the college students truly accepted Simon for who he was, not based on his outward appearance.  Jack was harsh about Simon at first, but finally came around, and realized that you can not always have what you want in life, and it means a lot to others when you treat them as if they are important and with respect.

I've listened and studied (some), and I succumbed to the fact that success is usually defined as a Suburbia home with a husband, two kids and a hefty bank account, with envious neighboors on each side. However, watching ""With Honors"" has allowed me to take a different perspective of what ""success"" is. Simon is not someone whom if you looked at you would think, ""Now there's a success. The American Dream personified."" Homeless, penniless, and unemployed, he was seen as nothing more than a bum. No chance of a success there right? But then, what is success? Simon was a world traveller. He experienced things most people can only dream of. In my opinion, Simon was no less than a success. The professor in the movie was a complete jackass. He had money coming out of his ears, fame and respect from all around. He wasn't a success. He was just a pompous, big headed jerk who took pleasure in belittling others... Here inlies the problem: Am I to conform to the traditional idea of success or be a success within my own eyes?

First time I watched this movie, I at first started to get the impression that it was going to be very teen drama ish, with the kids just being in college instead of high school.  By the time the movie ended, With Honors had moved up my list of favorites right behind The Shawshank Redemption.

Unpredictable, funny and heartwarming all at the same time.  But it's not only that.  It seems to slap you in the face with some of life's harsh realities in a way that makes you reflective and humble instead of hurt or upset.  Truly magical.

Very few movies are as capable of making me laugh one minute, then completely solemn the next.  And that's it's magic.  It's moving, it knows it is, and it uses that to bring you to a wonderful place.",1516752000,,803,4.3

7791420,4,0790737647,"This was a pretty enjoyable, touching movie. I like Brendan Frazier here just as I did in ""School ties"", playing an intellectual who also always seems strong and determined, which he played convincingly in both movies. In this movie, instead of playing a Jew dealing with antisemitism, he plays a striving scholar who meets a homeless man, Joe Pesci. Pesci was good in ""My cousin Vinny"" and in many others such as the Lethal Weapon films, Good fellas, and even in Home Alone. He's played a good variety of different types of people, but always in some form or another keeps a certain fierce determination.
When Brendan meets Pesci, who's living in the Harvard library boiler room and managed to get ahold of his thesis that he dropped, he blackmails Brendan a page back for a favor, and Brendan is somewhat stuck, so he reluctantly goes along with him, allows him to sleep in his van after getting kicked out of the library, brings him food, brings him to his class, etc.
I do have a few questions about a few things though; first of all, how had Pesci managed to live in the library's boiler room night after night without ever being seen? Until when Brendan called the police to have him removed. That brings me to my next question, when Pesci's in court, the judge initailly charges him with trespassing and drunkenness. Pesci argues how the Harvard library is public grounds and that he wasn't driving or operating machinery while drinking (but he was messing with fire in the furnace in the library, not the best thing while drunk either). But the way the judge automatically immediately accepts Pesci's arguments and drops the two charges just like that, it just seemed a little unbelievable and made the judge not look too bright having a homeless man successfully correct him twice on what's a feasible charge or not.  I'm guessing that was just done like that so it wouldn't hold up the continuing story.
The continuing story was good though. I really liked the bond that grew between Brendan and Pesci, you could see how Brendan really did feel for him, although not all of his roommates, especially the pre-med jerk in the house. The moment with Pesci standing up singing loudly in the bath when the pre-med jerk walked into the bathroom didn't sit that well with me, and Pesci's awful singing of a dirty version of ""Glory glory hallelujah"" was part of the reason for that  too. But then the great scenes continued.  I enjoyed the way Pesci made an arrogant professor look bad in front of his class, him criticising Brendan's thesis calling it pessimistic garbage, him trying to get Pesci government help and Pesci humorously being uncooperative (funny line: Social service worker: ""you got proof of birth?"" Pesci: ""I'm sitting here ain't I? You think I got here by spontaneous combustion?""), then Brendan telling Pesci about his late father who abandoned him when he was 5 (and turns out Pesci had something in common with Brendan's father, which we see later on), and Pesci telling Brendan about his failing lung disease caused by 20 years working with asbestos. It was all very touching. The movie stays that way the majority of the time. And there are some sad moments too, one being, as I started saying before, a very sad reunion with Pesci and his son that he abandoned long ago. It was quite heartbreaking the way that scene played out.  There were a couple tearjerkers. And plenty of good dialogue. It was a good movie.",1513036800,,3439,4.717138103161398
