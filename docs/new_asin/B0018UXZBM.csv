8271211,5,B0018UXZBM,"So excited to have a copy of this. Of course, it won't play on many American TVs and DVD players, including mine. But it works fine on VLC, which could play a brick on fire. All I have to do is play it on that and connect my computer to my TV through HDMI. Haven't even watched the film yet, just tested it to make sure the picture quality is good and the subtitles work. Both are fine. I recommend getting this if you're interested in seeing the film. All you need is VLC on your computer.",1443225600,,490,4.061855670103093
