8262101,5,B0016BWIBQ,"This is an excellent video. Montana's history, & how they have learned from it & have come a long way to make things more safe for all.
This was a very sad event. They did the best they knew how with the equipment they had. So sad for all the lives lost. But, now our firefighters are more knowledgeable in all situations, and have more modern equipment. We have better safety rules and companies are made to go by them. May GOD Bless All Firefighters & Keep Them Safe.",1298592000,,469,4.280898876404494
