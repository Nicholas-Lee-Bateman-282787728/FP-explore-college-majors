8478607,5,B005LVEFVS,"THE SOLI DEO GLORIA PRODUCTION OF HAYDN'S CREATION IS THE MOST VALUED ONE IN MY COLLECTION. NEVER HAVE I HEARD SUCH A RANGE  OF CHARACTERIZATION FROM  SOLOISTS IN AN ORATORIO. TO HEAR SUCH LOVELY VOICES VIRTUALLY ACT OUT HAYDN'S SCORE. THE HUMOR OF THE ANIMALS, THE GRANDEUR OF THE CREATION, THE HUMOR OF THE ANIMALS,  THE FRESHNESS OF THE FIRST VIEWING OF ADAM AND EVE'S BEAUTIFUL EARTH AS BRILLIANTLY AS IN THIS PRODUCTION. IT COULD ONLY BE THE RESULT OF THE CONDUCTOR AND HIS ORCHESTRA'S DIRECTION AND SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST RATE VOICES CHOSEN FOR THEIR PRODUCTION.  .",1414108800,5,570,4.785714285714286
8478608,5,B005LVEFVS,"The Creation and The Seasons were Haydn's final works, works composed as Haydn had heard the power of Beethoven and Mozart, and was experimenting, in my opinion, with the more modern philosophy of composition to be called Romanticism.  The libretto itself is based, at least partly, on Milton's Paradise Lost  The combination of all this genius gives birth to The Creation - one of the most spectacular works of classical music.  For the un-initiated, listen to the final item in this oratorio called ""The Earthquake"", can you then not put this work among the most exciting works of classical music ever written?",1364169600,4,612,4.980392156862745
