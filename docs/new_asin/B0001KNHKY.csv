2009040,3,B0001KNHKY,"A new torus, a giant stone tornado-shaped thing that floats in the air, has surfaced.  Oddly, the witnesses don't seem very surprised or awed (probably just bad acting).  With the new torus we see a return of some of the characters from the first film including David Keith.  He is on the run from a shadowy organization bent on killing him and his son.  We get a little history as to what has gone on since the first movie.

As the research begins on the new torus a third one shows up.  Now there are two floating about and they are putting out mysterious and opposed waves.  It seems like a battle between good and evil but who can tell with ancient floating alien rock things?  In the end the movie is much like the first as an ancient mystery is unraveled and we get glimpses of the purpose of the toruses.

Decent special effects and a good cast are the pluses in this film.  Some of the torus history does not mesh with what was learned in the first movie and there is even evidence that humans knew about the toruses fairly recently (last couple of thousand years) even though in the first movie the torus had been buried since before the creation of life.  While I prefer the first movie this one is a decent sequel and not just a cheap follow-up.",1147910400,15,1256,4.3247863247863245
2009041,4,B0001KNHKY,"This movie sequel has some drawbacks. The special effects were not as good as last time (specifically the inside and outside of the alien's ""house"") and it was less exciting as well. These differences were not too big either. On the other hand, the general cast's performance was good and the movie tries to show us the violence provoked by fear to the unknown. There has been recently a lot of attention (led by Michael Crichton) about the bad affects of fear, this movie is one of the first in this anti-fear-mongering wave.",1142812800,10,526,4.666666666666667
2009042,5,B0001KNHKY,"Pretty good for a sequel.  Unexpected and unnecessary nudity at the beginning when the main character enters a ""cat house"" to hide.  No nudity by the playmate supporting actress.  Despite what some reviews may mention as contridicting, the two torahs are opposite, one's life and the other's death.  It's the Main Character's son that ""revives"" the dead and only those who he sees near his dad!  Say as the first, movie is over just as it gets exciting!",1127174400,2,453,4.756410256410256
2009043,2,B0001KNHKY,"I picked up this poor excuse for a movie at Blockbuster, craving a sci-fi flick.  I'm glad it was cheap, because it is without a doubt a waste of money.

  The story is decent, if a bit contrived.  It is about a mysterious item called the Torus, that was able to conceive a very stupid engineers son without the act of sexual intercourse (bummer, engineers don't get enough sex as it is).  Anyway the Torus has reappeared with new features.  It can now heal people.  However a another Torus appears in the Eastern part of the world, near Russia, and it has the power of destruction.  If  the two Torus meat, then the earth will go through a destruction/reconstruction phase, and teraform the earth.  The problem is, that humanity will be dismissed during the earth restructuring phase, and we can't have that.  So we have to find a key or whatever.  Ah forget it.

  The plot is pretty good, but too convoluted and very cliched.  But that is not the worse of it, as the characters truly bring any redeeming quality this movie had plummeting downward.  Plotholes are here left and right.  The character development is non existent.  The bad guys, who work for some new age anti alien reglious nutso occult, are goofy.  And stuff that they are regurgitating is someones twisted interpretation of acting.  But the protagonist are equally bland.  No one should care about David Keith or his assistant, or his son.  The thing is you will no root for the bad guys either.  Who is an overly streotypical religous fanatic, with a bad southern baptist-TV evangelical accent to boot.

  As a matter of fact nothing is appealing in this movie.  The ""Army"" in the future are run by a bunch of incompetent nit wits, who can actually be killed by an unarmed assasin.  An assasin who seriously needs to take acting lessons.  That is not surprising since the Sergent is a complete moron.  In the future, I guess the army becomes alot less selective in who they let in.

  I got this movie expecting a sci-fi, but what I got was a comedy.  There is no way anyone could reasonably take these actors seriously.  They didn't even look they were trying.  So this must have been a comedy, and whoever wrote the plot summary on the back of the DVD must have just forgot to mention it.  A movie where Billie D. Williams is the best performer is definitely a joke.  You can skip this if you feel guilty about laughing AT people.  The plot is full of brain dead philosophy and catch phrases.  Even the geopolitical stuff involving China is just plain funny.  And everyone fits seemlessly into streotypes.  It fails as a sci-fi, but it excels as a comedy.  2 stars",1104624000,2,2637,4.552462526766595
2009044,1,B0001KNHKY,"Epoch Evolution has something (no, make that everything) for the male, pimple-faced, Sci-Fi buff. It has heavy duty Religion, resurrections from the dead, spontaneous healing and even the ""second coming, I think. ""Lazarus"" comes back from the dead and ""Abraham"" offers to sacrifice his son. It also has thermonuclear war, exploding space stations, exploding missiles, exploding submarines, exploding aircraft, exploding buildings, exploding cars, exploding people and a nude scene. It has aliens (or is it God?) and their space crafts. Mountains explode and buildings crumble. Thousands are killed and numerous running gun battles. It has more Armageddon than the Book of Revelations. OK special effects. If the ""actors"" would have been computer generated too, it would have improved the film. It is a ""deep"" movie for a ""shallow"" mind. The best part of the movie .... it is only 1:33 minutes long.",1097798400,3,898,5.330985915492958
2009045,2,B0001KNHKY,"This continues ten years after the end of the original (Epoch 2000). Rand, our hero, has a son. The two are on the run from the assassins who killed his wife years ago. Hold on to that fact, since it's the last one for a good long while that makes any sense.

As in Epoch, we have the giant, mysterious, stone cone-thingie. We learn that it's called a Torus, possibly because it's unlike a torus in just about every way. Since this is a sequel, we need something more: two Toruses! Also, we have the secret, well-funded, trans-national cult of nutcases, the ones out to kill Our Hero for reasons oddly devoid of reason. Somehow, the cult manages to gain entry to one Torus before the good guys, and hide an inept killer inside. Also, the cult gets into the second Torus just behind the good guys. We watch as our ingenious scriptwriters convince the highly trained military team not to guard their escape route, allowing the somewhat less inept killers to sneak up behind and stage a merry shootout. Along the way, we have a rogue Chinese general launching nuclear missiles and whatnot, and a monastery filled with centuries-old clues. Since the monks spent centuries not caring, one is left wondering how anyone thought to look there for The Key. We also have some special effects emanating from the two Toruses. If the two SPFX touch each other, then kablooie! It will be the end of all life on earth, followed by a thorough remodeling of the place and a new set of life forms as tenants - presumably, ones that will take better care of the property. I am in awe of the mind that could deduce all that from a green light on one Torus and a red light on the other.

Of course, there's a happy ending filled with sequel-bait - the only other thing in the movie I could understand. The son is actually a Mysterious Being and walking first aid kit, with an incredible future ahead of him (coming soon to DVD, one may assume). It also turns out that the stone thingies aren't stone at all, they were something even cooler, just dressed up as stone!

It's fair grade-D (for Direct to DVD) science fiction action flick. If you're looking to kill an evening this might do the job, or at least leave it with some nasty bruises.

2009046,2,B0001KNHKY,"In this movie, a gaint rock formation bursts out of the ground near China.  Apparently of alien origin, a US team is sent to investigate.  The head scientist (played by David Keith) specializes in pointing out how stupid everyone else is, though this isn't contrasted with any particular brilliance on his own part.  In fact, if you bother to pay attention (unlike the writers), you'll notice he's actually wrong and everyone else is right.  The lead government agent (played by Stephanie Niznik) refuses to let the scientist do his job because he made a bad joke and she's mad at him.  There's also a military guy along who specializes in disobeying orders and generally acting insane while quoting from the Bible.  So, the fate of the world is in good hands.

The biggest problem is that the movie never answers its own question:  What is the grand purpose of this thing?  The scientist comes up with some theories, but considering he's been wrong about everything up to that point, and his theories don't answer the main question:  Why?  It's very unsatisfying.

But, if you can swallow all that, it's a watchable movie.  The action moves along fairly well, the acting is good enough though the characters aren't especially likable, and the CGI is better than average.  Or maybe there's just more of it than average.  Though the movie lacks any substance, it scores at least a few points for style.",1093824000,,1401,4.779166666666667
2009047,3,B0001KNHKY,"Deeply steeped in pseudo-mystical and religious undertones, EPOCH is not a bad sci-fi movie. The effects are fair to middlin, so to speak, but it captures the awesome ""rock"" that rises out of the earth. There are some cliche characterizations, particularly in the roles played by Craig Wasson and Ryan O'Neal, but David Keith and Stephanie Niznik do well in their hero/heroine roles. I Particularly enjoyed Brian Thompson, who played Captain Towers. Initially a stereotypical Rambo type, he reveals a side unexpected, and he turns into kind of a hero. This reversal is refreshing, and Thompson (Buffalo Bob in Joe Dirt) gives a good performance.

 The movie has a nice message; it's pace is a little slow at times, but it's a pleasant enough diversion.",1090368000,2,752,5.008

2009069,4,B0001KNHKY,"I sorry to say,but this sequel of--Epoch--there should of been more thought. David Keith plays his character from the first,and does A wonderful job doing it. His character along with his son are on the the run from some racial group how believe the boy of being not of this earth. And might be A threat to man kind so they are trying to kill him and his father.

2009070,1,B0001KNHKY,"We had such high hopes for this movie.  The first one was quite good, and had depth and spirituality to it.  This one was just empty troop movements and pointless gunfights with no coherent plot behind them.  We stopped caring about the outcome after a while.  The presence of Billy Dee Williams did nothing to help this sad attempt at a sequel.  An incoherent mess.  Avoid it.",1262390400,2,377,4.552238805970149

2009075,3,B0001KNHKY,This second installment is a interesting but bland continuation of Epoch.  More of a good vs. evil orientation to the devices.  A good Saturday afternoon movie.,1223424000,,160,5.115384615384615
2009076,3,B0001KNHKY,"The settings, special effects, lighting, score, and all the movie magic in Epoch: Evolution is excellent.  The filmakers spared no expense.  The acting and story, however, are weaker.  The story is about a Dr. Rand who is on the run from an organization that killed his wife and is hunting him and his young son.  The group thinks that the boy was conceived in an unholy alien union. Meanwhile, strange rock formations are rising from the ground all over the world, and seem to contain alien life forms.  Are these ""Toruses"" good or bad, and do the events escalating toward war between the U.S.,Russia and China have something to do with their appearances?

The film is more a 'what-if' scenario of how the military would react to these events than a clever and deep sci-fi story.  Like I said before, the settings are realistic and you see the inside of a Chinese command center, Chinese and Russian sub, the space station, the Torus, and much more.  Oh, there is some nudity at the beginning, of German hookers who are hiding Rand.  Pointless, but hence the R rating.",1220313600,,1069,4.67379679144385
2009077,2,B0001KNHKY,"This movie seems to be a sequel to one in which a boy

It has aliens, religion and what appears to be 'magic'
technology all wrapped up together with no hard science any where to be found.
A chase move where religious fundamentalist sent an hit
team to take out the boy and his father.
The boy has Jesus like  resurrection  of the dead powers:
they call him the one from within.
