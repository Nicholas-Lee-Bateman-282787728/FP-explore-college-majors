8630833,3,B00H8CVPHU,"This is the German title of ""The Dead and the Damned"" 2011.

The movie opens with a silly close range blood squirting shoot out. Mortimer (David A. Lockhart) is a bounty hunter. After collecting his bounty he opts to go after an Indian (Rick Mora) wanted for raping a ""white virgin."" (I don't write this stuff.) Others have tried and died. He lives in the woods. Mortimer buys Rhiannon (Camille Montgomery) a reluctant woman to come with him to use as bait.

Meanwhile there is a subplot of a meteor being found in a farmer's field with fluorescent green stuff and no Steven King. The farmer has a daughter (Heather Montanez) who does take a bath...and like any good circus, the big top is worth the price of admission. The meteor turns the town's folk into the fast moving zombies as opposed to the raise from the dead variety.

I liked the metal soundtrack. We've seen worse acting. Many are first time actors. The special effects or make-up was very stiff. The dialogue wasn't great. The buttons on the women's blouses never seemed to work either.

No f-bombs, no sex, nudity (Camille Montgomery, Mandy Pauline, Heather Montanez) 2 star film normally, plus one for wardrobe malfunctions",1473033600,,1189,4.757281553398058
