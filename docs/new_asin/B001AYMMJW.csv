But if you're like most. You're wondering if there's anything more than PG-13 here. Nope. Sorry. But then again, you shouldn't expect it. I find Hooters to be strong managers of their brand. Unfortunate as Playboy made money off of Naked Hooters Girls. Why shouldn't Hooters directly (even if only in their extras)? If not, a great addition would have been to have them in their native Hooters outfits either on the video, or even in the Pageant. Without something uniquely Hooters, honestly it doesn't separate this from any other of the 100 different pageants. And Honestly, Trump and Ms. USA dare I say is a touch racier (sad but true).

That being said. The video quality exceeded expectations. Creativity with source material or production wasn't there. But it was a solid performer. I'll probably get the others, for the right price.",1296950400,,1108,4.919786096256685
