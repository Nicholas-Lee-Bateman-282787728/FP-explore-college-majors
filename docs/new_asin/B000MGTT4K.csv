8169177,5,B000MGTT4K,Another all time Meg Swansen knitting DVD.  Meg's a great instructor and her company still takes phone calls when you get stuck.,1416528000,3,128,4.818181818181818
8169178,5,B000MGTT4K,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the cardigan in the DVD is not to my taste but the DVD focuses very little on the design and knitting of the sweater.  Instead, this DVD centers primarily around the techniques of cardigans including steeking, finishing edges, neck and front button bands, etc.  If you have never steeked before or would like to see some expert tips demonstrated, this is an excellent reference!",1255824000,8,418,4.873239436619718
8169179,5,B000MGTT4K,"I love this DVD and enjoy Meg's techniques and her explanations. It feels like a friend is in your home explaining and helping you knit a great cardigan.
The knitting up and garter stitch around the cardigan front and neck ALONE is worth the price of this DVD, the other tips are just frosting on the cake (but very helpful). Since I can't afford her knitting camp, this DVD is like having a private lesson, and a free refresher whenever I want. Huge thanks to Meg Swansen from a person that has been knitting only three years.",1233964800,5,527,4.443298969072165
8169180,4,B000MGTT4K,"I usually really like her DVD's...however in this one I did learn several techniques but this sweater is NOT my style.  I use for the techniques only.
If this sweater is something that you like you will also benefit from the
design.",1210809600,2,232,4.523809523809524
