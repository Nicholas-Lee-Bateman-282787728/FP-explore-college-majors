Secondly, this is a review about the DVD quality etc, not the movie itself.

This DVD has two features that sit right at the top of things that really tick me off when it comes to DVDs.
1. No menu, chapters etc. You put the disc in the player and it automatically starts playing. Horrible!!
2. The media company Real Entertainment decided to put their stupid RE logo at the bottom right corner throughout the entire movie. WTF? If I buy a DVD I want to watch it as it was released, not with friggin logos on it.

I wil not be buying any more Real Entertainment releases and suggest that anyone seeking this movie should buy one of the other 2 DVD productions available.

8190765,5,B000PDZRYQ,"As most viewers will be aware, this movie used Ernest Haycox's book TRAIL TOWN as it guiding background. It must have been familiar territory for Randolph Scott as he appeared in movies made from many western author's books: Zane Grey, Jonas Ward, Luke Short, and Haycox among others.

This western is one of very few that shows one condition of the 'ole' west as it pretty much was, the towns oft times were divided down the middle, with the saloons and other sinful devices on one side of town, with the schools, churches, and businesses on the other. Often the train tracks helped to separate the two sections. And the twain did not meet, no pun intended. This condition did not apply to all towns for certain, but did occur in many. As the film shows for a town marshal to walk both sections of the town took great proficiency. And though it did not happen that often, some trail towns did suffer from ""treeing the town"", but most often as the film depicts, the town's folk armed themselves and sent the 'cowboys' off, on their way.

One must also find pleasure with the talents of the cast in this picture, and also in their youthful appearances. The musical numbers are quite catchy, though when I watch a western most musical interludes get on my nerves. I want my westerns fairly realistic without singing cowboys, but in this movie as many others, the music adds to the allure of the movie magic. Ann Dvorak is just magnificent in both song and dance.

I have a couple copies of this film and must say it is one of my favorites, mainly due to Scott. But through many viewing I have come to appreciate the other actors roles as well. And anyone having seen THE DESPERADOES knows that Edgar Buchanan and Randolph Scott did very well together on any screen.

Looking for an enjoyable 90 minutes or so of film, then you might want to watch this movie from long ago.  And don't miss Scott's obedient horse that follows him everywhere. Wonder how they got the horse to do that.
