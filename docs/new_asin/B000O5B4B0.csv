2790642,5,B000O5B4B0,Of course the quality isn't amazing for this moving but that did not matter to me.  I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan and thing this animated movie did an excellent job portraying the mystery.  I only wish it was longer because I enjoyed it so much.,1323820800,,246,4.212765957446808
2790643,3,B000O5B4B0,The first half is good with only some acceptable changes to the story for time.  Unfortunetly they changed the thief into a ruthless murderer out for revenge which reduces the emotional appeal of the story.  My rating is actually 3 1/2 for the first half is a 4 but the changes to the ending lower it to a 3.  If you want an Ian Richardson Sherlock Holmes this is the one to buy do not touch The Hound of the Baskervilles.,1303603200,5,422,4.185185185185185

8182996,5,B000O5B4B0,"a very original and very cool Sherlock. And yet very confident. The adaptation makes it also very interesting. historical: the times when colonial forces thought naught of looting India. (last treasures found lately hidden in the areas not invaded by the moghuls. :) ) treasures which are even now shocking. Andaman anthropology, Holmes developing scientific research, boating the Thames.. An excellent adaptation which hangs well together. A classic Sherlock movie. Watson does not hesitate to challenge his good friend. Nor show offense. On the notable issue of Dr Watson's brother and the watch Mr Michael Hardwick - a notable sherlockian - wrote a Watson novel. (also very good, realistic, historical, and ""fits""). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was in rare shape for this tale: and so were Ian Richardson, the screen play's writer  C E Pogue, and the composer of the soundtrack Harry Rabinowitz. Director Desmond Davis must have enjoyed working with these guys.
 sad they didn't make more. Probably too good: Like The Murder Rooms - with Ian Richardson doing Professor Dr Bell. (grab those!)",1465516800,2,1088,5.211428571428572
8182997,1,B000O5B4B0,"A real disappointment.  Ian Richardson had a career filled with wonderful performances in many excellent productions.  His two outings as Sherlock, sadly, were in mostly lamentable productions.  This version of THE SIGN OF FOUR is disastrous.  Wildly inappropriate to the spirit of the original--the scenes at the carnival and house of mirrors being particularly irrelevant and ridiculous--this production is poorly structured, indifferently acted and lamely written.  Stick to the miles better SIGN OF FOUR with Jeremy Brett, John Thaw (in a particularly wonderful turn here and very different than his Inspector Morse), and written by John Hawksworth.  Brett's two Watson's (David Burke and Edward Hardwicke) were both much superior to Richardson's colorless Watson, David Healy.  To make matters worse, this Blu Ray is also a technical disappointment.  The original aspect ratio--likely  4:3--has been zoomed up to wide screen with the inevitable chopping off of heads and other parts of the original image.",1462233600,,1010,5.592105263157895

8182999,5,B000O5B4B0,"One of the best Sherlock Holmes movies ever made! Captures the ambiance of a Holmes mystery and the acting is first rate. It doesn't try to reinvent Holmes (as some modern films have done), but it still maintains a unique feel to the interpretation of the character. Worth adding to your collection!",1442188800,,299,4.769230769230769

8183001,5,B000O5B4B0,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.  Ian Richardson plays Sherlock Holmes quite well.  I own 3 versions of ""The Sign of Four""; Jeremy Brett, Matt Frewer and this version which holds up pretty well compared to the other 2 versions.  I was surprised at how good the quality was for something this old.  This was worth every penny to replace an old VHS copy I have of the movie!  I highly recommend this film for any fan of Sherlock Holmes movies and Stories!!!",1432166400,2,462,4.585365853658536
8183002,5,B000O5B4B0,Excellent Sherlock Holmes portrayal by Ian Richardson as well as a marvelous adaption of one of Conan Doyle's early works.,1384905600,,122,5.15
8183003,4,B000O5B4B0,"Ian Richardson is close to the perfect Sherlock Holmes, but I discovered him first portraying Doyle's inspiration for Holmes, Dr. Bell, and then learned of his two theatrical roles as Holmes in THE SIGN OF FOUR, and the subsequent HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES.

Richardson's portrayal of this often filmed Holmes story is, at worst, better then most of those I've seen, and the slight changes in script from the standard FOUR efforts make it refreshing.  Richardson as Holmes was an outstanding choice and I hope to see him again in the rolls of both Holmes (white haired or not) and Dr. Bell, mentor to the youthful doctor Arthur Doyle!

Get this Sign of Four while you can . . . it seems to disappear too often; and while you're doing so, pick up his version of Hound and both Bell offerings; you won't be disappointed.",1367020800,6,818,4.627586206896551
8183004,5,B000O5B4B0,"Possibly one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories, I have regrettably found that most film adaptations of this classic tale are usually missing some pivotal elements, making SIGN a novel that has never really translated well from page to screen. Yet aside from a few random deviations, this version not only closely approximates its Canon counterpart, but also makes a worthy attempt at delivering the action in addition to the deductive reasoning, and remarkably resembles the tale of adventure Doyle intended it to be. From the infamous scene with Watson's pocket watch to the delightful representation of an impish Holmes besting the official Inspector in the locked room investigation of Bartholomew Sholto's death, to the clever plot twist at the end, every aspect of this film was worthy of the original.

David Healy makes for a competent Watson, not particularly my favourite in the role, though he gives an admirable performance as a somewhat exasperated, intelligent man of action. I can actually see his being a rough sketch for David Burke's Watson - in that they tend to play up similar characteristics - and in fact much of the set and costumes were reminiscent of the detailed period accuracy portrayed by Granada. I will even go so far as saying it was perhaps a bit more authentic to the Victorian era, especially in regards to Baker Street. On the topic of comparisons to Granada, in my estimation, Ian Richardson is truly one of the scant few to ever rival (and dare I say, is at times better than) Jeremy Brett. Though occasionally limited by the script, he is phenomenal in the role. Richardson's Holmes is eerily faithful to the man Watson describes, not only with his mannerisms and the way in which he conveys Holmes' unique humour and temperament, but with his austere countenance, (dark) grey eyes - even his voice gave me the shivers, it was so compatible to that of the Sherlock Holmes in my mind. Needless to say, I was instantly impressed, and it was not long before I was utterly enamoured with his performance.

True, there was an occasional instance where I felt the plot would have benefited from sticking closer to the story, but these were more like minor nitpicks than anything that caused the storyline to suffer. This was fast moving, suspenseful and stood up very well to a second viewing the next day. It is one of the best Holmes movies I have yet to see (and that list is quite extensive). I am genuinely lamenting the fact a full series of feature length movies were not made with Richardson, so I will just have to settle for multiple re-watches...",1362268800,13,2592,4.796420581655481
