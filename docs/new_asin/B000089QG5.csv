1832560,5,B000089QG5,"The 19 month old Tubby fan in our household absolutely loves this video!  Two segments of Teletubbies everywhere are followed by plenty of story and film segments.  In particular, there is a film with children watching peacocks which always brings squeals of laughter.  Well worth the money, this video provides any mom with 51 minutes of quiet time!",1092355200,17,350,5.0
1832561,5,B000089QG5,"We have both ""Look"" and ""What's That?"" on video, but the ""Oooh"" DVD we got is definitely the favorite Teletubbies for weekend watching. My daughter loves the Teletubbies, and also loves bubbles... this DVD has both! The pink Tubby custard bubbles sequence alone made it worth getting. She's also fascinated by the appearing and disappearing blue bells sequence. We have yet to discover all that the DVD has to offer, but already I can recommend it as a great first Teletubbies DVD for your toddler's viewing.",1086048000,25,508,4.9186046511627906

1832573,2,B000089QG5,"The first half of this video is the Teletubbies parading in front of a blue screen.  At first my daughter was intrigued by the multiplying Teletubbies but soon lost interest.

Twenty minutes or so later came the live action parts and that was a little better for her.  Still the only part that she liked was when the Tubbycustard machine started making bubbles.

I think that there are probably better DVDs out there to get instead of this one.",1219017600,,444,4.582278481012659
1832574,5,B000089QG5,As long as my baby enjoys it then that's all that matters. Personally I don't care for it.,1214006400,,90,4.055555555555555

1832577,4,B000089QG5,This is not mine nor my kids favorite Teletubbies movie.  It is cute and they will watch it but my son will ask for one of the others over it everytime.,1184803200,,152,3.903225806451613
1832578,5,B000089QG5,"And the show is for CHILDREN - specifically pre-schoolers who neither know nor CARE whether a person is a boy or girl! Adults impose that, kids that young don't care a bit. The show was developed by child development experts and appeals to their sense of color, music, repetition, silly noises and familiarity all while teaching essential lessons: being polite, loving your family (they are family to each other) cleaning up yourself and your messes, being nice to the creatures they share their world with, physical activity is good and flying kites on a windy day is great fun. While it isn't something I would watch it does entertain my 17 month old - I only allow DVD viewing for limited times so she doesn't have much to compare it to - though Elmo is also up there. It isn't that I ohject to TV per se - just that even PBS is becoming commercial (toy commericals on PBS Sprout!!) and I don't want to deal with that - so DVDs are the way to go.

My baby really likes the Tubbies and why shouldn't a teletubby carry a purse or wear a tutu!! They love each other, are nice to the bunnies and their vacuum.. and never do anything mean or racist.. what more can you ask!! I am not sure how a leap to homosexuality can be made - since they all wear a skirt at times and at no time does ANY tubbie come out and say I am a boy or girl... THEY ARE FAKE CREATURES and therefore can be any or no gender at all!",1159142400,14,1405,4.203703703703703
1832579,1,B000089QG5,"My daughter is a big fan of Teletubbies and I must say that it's pretty entertaining for kids.  Kids love repetition and colors.  One thing I hate about teletubbies is when Tinky-Winky carrying and dancing around with a red purse!!!  What in the world is he doing? Isnt Tinky Winky a boy? My daughter even asked me that same question!!  Pls can anyone tell me.  It gives a very bad example to kids implying that homosexuality is a normal behavior.  They should not show this episode EVER to kids!!!  I highly agree with the other mom's review that teletubbies should not promote homosexuality.  The world is already complicated, let's not make it more complicated.",1155945600,3,664,4.7631578947368425
1832580,5,B000089QG5,"This is one of about 6 Teletubbies DVDs we own and is one of the best.  The scenes with the Tubbies are more interesting than some of the ones in our other videos, and include a scene with Dipsy watching what's going on in Tubbyland, a scene with Tubby custard bubbles, and more.  The scenes with the kids are also good, and there is a special feature that my 20 mo. old son also likes, where the Tubbies play on a seesaw.  This DVD, along with ""All Together Teletubbies"" and ""Look"" are my son's favorites.  He also likes ""Favorite Things"" but I think that's only available on VHS.",1155600000,15,581,4.351851851851852

7980897,5,B000089QG5,"I like the 2005 Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment Copy VHS alot. I also the Original 2004 Warner Home Video Copy VHS too. But, the 2005 VHS is SUPER EXTREMELY RARE!
