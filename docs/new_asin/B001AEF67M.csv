8277221,5,B001AEF67M,"I just love Sana! She cracks me up with her bubbly personality! I sooo hoped for a 3rd season. I wanted to see her & her naughty boy ^_^. They are sooo cute! Its a must see for all ages. I just love it, I know anyone will also.",1356220800,,227,3.6530612244897958
8277222,2,B001AEF67M,"The first season boxset followed the manga very closely and what it did add was well done. This set of episodes diverges from the manga almost entirely, which wouldn't be a problem if the added storylines weren't as poorly executed and dull as they are. It would be a better idea to find the tokyopop manga somewhere and read that instead of watching the rest of the anime.",1277596800,,373,4.5
8277223,5,B001AEF67M,"Crazy! Hilarious! LMFAO. BRILLIANT!!
This has got to be in my top 3 favorite anime series ever!! It's a shame that Funimation won't dub the second half of Kodocha... I cried when the series ended, I'm still upset that the series couldn't have been extended a couple more episodes... but still, GREAT anime show! A MUST HAVE!!",1276560000,,325,4.719298245614035
8277224,5,B001AEF67M,"Continues the first set's fun and games, but with a few rather more serious story lines among the fun.  Bankruptsy, nosy papparazzi trying to destroy your reputation and career, rat fink agents trying to blacklist/blackmail you, Death of a very close friend, and more.  Yet Sana overcomes them all.  And has a fun time.  Very good stuff.",1274140800,2,337,4.859649122807017
8277225,5,B001AEF67M,"This series is one that I had the more fun watching than most other anime, due to the extreme hyperactivity of the main character.  I was worried at first, when it came to the English voice acting, since the Japanese voice actress speaks so fast that it fits.  Luckily, the English voice actress is also rather hyper when it comes to this character.  It does get a little bogged down and sad for a bit, but picks up again.  After all, no one can always be that hyper without exploding or something.

Keep in mind that this is based on the manga, but it veers away from the manga later on, since the manga was still being produced when this was being created.  So, the anime producers had to go on their own when they caught up to the point in the manga where they were at.

If you like spice of life comedy, or even if you like a fairly dramatic series (but not too dramatic), then I think this series would be a good one for you.",1266364800,,930,4.162011173184357
8277226,5,B001AEF67M,I bought the DVDs for my daughter and she has been raving about it since. She absolutely loves it,1265155200,3,97,4.157894736842105
8277227,5,B001AEF67M,"Kodocha is a great anime from a girl that has a great life,but with her hapiness come allot of hardships and all type of topics Adult kind of topics which are great they help you realize and understand life. Sana Kurata age 11 is a great lively person but sometimes its a exterior method she utalize's when she's in pain or hurt. Akito hayama is the person she loves but too innocent to accept. a person she will have to learn to lose till she understands how much she loves. Watch i do recommend i wish they made season three",1248393600,,526,4.27

8277229,4,B001AEF67M,Funimation finally released volume 7-13 in a complete box set. Now we don't have to buy the babbit box set two and then buy volume 9-13 individally. You can just buy volume 7-13 and be done with it. When I realized Funimation was going to release this my first thought was that they finnally recieved the rights for Season 2 only to find out that it was only Season one's volume 7-13. I was very dissapointed when i found out that they didn't realease Season 2. I am glad they released this for people who don't own these volumes. Funimation should not false advertize. I do recomend this box set to any fan looking to complete thier collection. I won't give this 5 stars only because of the misprint but I do give 4 stars for convienence of the volumes 7-13 together in one box set.,1219190400,18,783,4.36986301369863
