4100065,4,B003A8FET6,"Denzel Washington's Eli, in The Book of Eli is walking through a post-apocalyptic American west. A blanched and bleaching landscape that more resembles the moon than Earth, and where sunglasses and Chapstick are used as money. We can only guess at what happened and Eli only tells us about ""the flash"" and a hole was torn in the atmosphere. Eli is heading ""west"" toward an uncertain destination like a post-apocalyptic Shaolin priest to deliver a book to unknown people who may be able to use the book to restart civilization.

Eli is a survivor, as he travels the destroyed roads of civilization his skills have become finely honed, he can smell the camouflaged highwaymen and dispatches them using a machete, or karate and in only extreme cases does he use a gun, he has to conserve bullets.

In his travels Eli comes into a town run by Gary Oldman's Carnegie, a man bent on consolidating and spreading his ruthless rule by sending out the highwaymen to search for books. One book in particular, a book that will give him the power to manipulate people so he can extend his ruthless influence. Humorously, Carnegie orders the DaVinci Code and Oprah magazine burned, or is it a sly commentary on the impermanence of pop culture? Carnegie discovers Eli has the book he's looking for and tries to trade for it with water and failing that, his daughter Solara (Mila Kunis). Eli isn't the type of man Carnegie is used to dealing with and Eli leaves, but not without killing many of Carnegie's men.

Roger Ebert in his review said the ending has a WTF moment and I expected some horrible inconsistency or deus ex-machina but I found the ending consistent with the rest of the movie and plausible within the world in which the characters find themselves. There is one minor inconsistency in the plot that is never explained. Eli locks Solara in a cave but mysteriously enough and without explanation in the next scene she's chasing after Eli.

Denzel Washington is one of the few actors whose movies I'll go see without knowing too much about the movie and his performance is his usual rock solid characterization. He plays Eli very subtly and with few words but emotion that pulls you in. Gary Oldman is as creepy or maybe creepier than he was in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Or maybe it was the Hughes Brothers decision to film Oldman with every crevice and blemish of his complexion marring his face that defines the character. Mila Kunis as Solara seems to be coming into her own as an actress and is more than able to hold her own in scenes with Washington.

Directed by the Hughes Brothers whose previous credits include From Hell they have created a bleak landscape that is devoid of color and use all shades of black, white and gray without the movie being or feeling like it's in black and white.

I went to the movie without expecting too much and I reall enjoyed the movie, my verdict? See The Book of Eli for yourself.

Note to the Hughes Brothers: Nice reference to A Boy and His Dog in the background in one scene.",1263513600,,3017,4.6280373831775705
4100066,4,B003A8FET6,"This wound up being better than expected. The first few trailers and TV spots were interesting as they completely avoided spoilers relating to the film. More recent TV spots, ones that were being shown as recent as yesterday, pretty much spoil what the book actually is. You may have already been able to guess what particular book it is, but seeing everything unfold without any expectations or predictions is the best way to see the film. The Book of Eli seemed to be going in a direction that was predictable at times, but then went down an unexpected detour to end up at a completely separate destination. Without spoiling too much, the events that are revealed in the finale of the film make the entire experience worthwhile. What transpires in the last twenty minutes or so pretty much makes you want to watch the film again and solidifies the Eli character as a vagabond of the most ultimate caliber.

Denzel Washington's portrayal of a man who's gotten so caught up in the mission that's been given to him that he's forgotten how it feels to interact with genuine people is nearly flawless. Well, that and the action scenes he's a part of are spectacular and incredibly exciting to watch. The rather underrated Gary Oldman does a fantastic job of making you hate his character, as well. Carnegie is so smarmy and selfish that you nearly jump for joy once the empire he's built begins to crumble. It was surprising, in a good way, to see Malcolm McDowell have a small part in the film. Although his character doesn't have much screen time, he still made a small impact. Tom Waits as the Engineer managed to have a few great scenes with Denzel Washington, as well. Mila Kunis didn't really offer anything new as far as her acting goes, but she fit the Solara role pretty well. Jennifer Beals seemed to be the weak link in the cast though. She has a scene with Gary Oldman where she begins to break down and start crying that just didn't feel up to par with the rest of the cast, but that could be classified as a nitpick.

The Book of Eli is a great way to start the new year with a bang as far as moviegoing experiences go. The film's storyline is a bit reminiscent of films like Fahrenheit 451 and Equilibrium since all three films deal with book burning in a not too distant future. There's actually one scene near the end of the film where Eli and Solara are in a boat that brought Children of Men to mind, a trait that is purely meant as a compliment. The Book of Eli delivers a highly entertaining ride from beginning to end composed of strong performances from the cast, an enticing story, and a blindsided ending. Highly recommended.",1263513600,7,2647,4.535564853556485
4100067,4,B003A8FET6,"""The Book of Eli"", written by Gary Whitta and directed by Albert and Allen Hughes.

Post nuclear holocaust; Times are very bleak. Water and food are scarce and the lands are ruled by raiders and cannibals. Eli (Denzel Washington) makes his way west on foot diligently reading every night. Eventually he stumbles onto a small town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie is in search of a very special book, one that is now very rare. It turns out that Eli has the very book and Carnegies will do anything to get it...

""The Book of Eli"" was a decent watch. I didn't go in with super high expectations but actually enjoyed it. It isn't a life changer but a watchable popcorn flick.

The Good: The story was well written and the performances by all the actors were enjoyable. I always like Gary Oldman and while this wasn't his best character his performance as always was top notch.

The Bad: I feel like they washed out a little too much of the color in the film. I realize the point was for effect but wish they would have left a little more in.

Overall: ""The Book of Eli"" is a decent movie worth checking out.",1263513600,4,1112,4.404878048780488

4100069,5,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli is a dystopian movie that works for me. I have watched it a few times, so I already know the crux of the matter and the turning point on which the story hinges. Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman deliver solid performances as always, and the story unfolds well. Its a simple story about a simple book, but the weight of the meaning behind the book is something Oldmans character has already worked out. The filming is quite stylized, a sort of graphic novel feel which works well in the dystopian setting. A good movie.",1526083200,,534,4.459183673469388

4100079,4,B003A8FET6,"Unlike The Road, The Book of Eli does not linger on the bleak, morose and desolate dying Earth. The world in Book of Eli while barren and hot, is also filled with brutal killers and savages, but there always appears to be a light at the end of the tunnel. I liked that. Coupled  fine performances by Denzel Washington, Mila Kunis and Gary Oldman, we see the best of both worlds here.

In a way I wish Mila and Denzel's characters could have walked with Viggo and his son in The Road. I doubt any of those cannibals would have survived to tell the tale. I'm talking the guys on the truck and the mob that chased and murdered the woman and her child. But getting back to Book of Eli, I think the town and the ruthless bully boy gangs seemed a bit too much. All of the men seemed to take orders from Carnagie unconditionally. This puzzled me, especially after the first town shootout (Which Killed 10 Or 12 men) and the melee in the bar which slew 15 people. That would have been half his gang of enforcers dead or seriously wounded. Yet we see in the end what happens when there are not enough enforcers to enforce his will.

I liked this film better than The Road mainly because there was a ""light at the end of the tunnel."" This allowed me to dream that things would get better for the planet. Nothing like that existed in The Road, which may have been more realistic, yet in movies we search for escapism not realism.

Mila Kunis plays Solara, and she is incredible. She goes from being a nave barmaid to an attempted rape survivor to a tough chick that kills and maims and garrotes those in her way. The guy who wanted her made a big mistake underestimating her tenacity. When she got out of the truck and tossed that grenade with super accuracy I said to myself--look out--boom!

Both The Road and Book of Eli have numerous allusions of cannibalism. The Road is the most literal representation of this horror, whereas Book of Eli cannibalism is mostly alluded to yet it is no less frightening. I give this DVD Four Stars. I'm the 1972nd person to review this film. I also want to say how I loved the graphic novel that was produced about Carnegie's life pre nuclear holocaust. It explained his character and made me understand why he was motivated the way he was to seek the Bible--even though it cost him 85% of his men and the use of his leg due to the poor medical technology of the time. Buy it and you will enjoy it more than The Road. Although Viggo Mortenson's performance in that film (And Kodi's) were spot on. Yet Leonard Maltin only gave Book of Eli Two or Two and a Half Stars out of Four. He gave The Road Two and a Half  Stars to about Three Stars. See my reviews for both movies.

It also shows how good men and evil men seek to use it to varying purposes- but it doesn't deny the inherent power in the specific stories and wording of the Bible.  Paraphrasing just isn't the same.  One man (played by Denzel Washington) has a mission 'to go West' after some cataclysmic event in which most of humanity has been murdered by nuclear weapons.  We aren't told why he must go West, but it becomes clear very quickly that he is imbued with incredible skills and almost supernatural abilities to stay alive, even in the face of bullets.  He has been walking for 30 years.  The world has become a barbaric and frightful place where food and fresh water are things for which people will murder each other.  We find him in the middle of his journey.  This movie is entirely unexpected and will surprise that will keep you pinned to your seat until the very last line.",1515542400,7,1049,4.531914893617022

As if He did not have anything to do with the destruction of the world in the first place!

Saving graces from this badly plotted,badly scripted and badly directed mish-mash (described as 'Feel-good' by one reviewer!)?
1. Denzel never puts out a bad performance; maybe he should have been Jack Reacher.
2. Short but excellent appearance from Frances de la Tour and Michael Gambon. But even they can not help the plot in which they are so well armed that they could have seen off the baddies in under a minute (thus shortening this fiasco by half and hour) but, for no known reason they do not.

4100141,3,B003A8FET6,"Let me begin by noting that I'll watch just about any movie with Denzel Washington in it. Twice. But having said that, this is one I'd never watch again. I suppose one could say that I should have expected religious overtones given the title, but seriously, some of the human behaviors and supernatural elements were trite yet completely unbelievable. That the main female character, having lived in a world where she was constantly in fear of being sold to the highest bidder, would suddenly find God and become a true believer, is a bit hard to stomach. I did like the juxtaposition of Washington as a man of staunch faith who also beats the living hell out of evildoers. And I liked that the supernatural elements were relatively few and far between. But the repeated soliloquys about God and the beauty of faith in the face of all-encompassing evil eventually wore me out. At that point I could no longer enjoy the movie for its actual story, which wasn't bad but wasn't tremendously good, either.

For my money, MAN ON FIRE and THE EQUALIZER are way better than this movie, and written more tightly and with more drive.",1511395200,,1124,4.6767676767676765

4100150,5,B003A8FET6,"Book of Eli is a nice addition to the canon of cinematic post apocalyptic stories.  I would place it on par with the Mad Max franchise in stature in the cinematic dimension, although there has been a spate of recent additions, such as Walking Dead, which are more or less insipid.  But Book of Eli is different.  Eli carries a mysterious book on order of God, or rather a voice in his head which he believed to be god, across the USA to San Francisco, an apt destination, ""Saint Francis"".  Strong clues are dropped early that the book is actually the Christian bible, so no spoiler here.  The story is suffused with profound meditation on the nature of religion and the meaning of life, which exults it above mere genre stories.  The power of the book is what makes Eli complete his journey, the quest representing the journey of life as usual.  The story has a nice series of twists at the end, as good as the best of M. Night Shamylan!

The post apocalyptic genre is a sub branch of science fiction where the action is set on earth in the wake of some apocalypse that destroys human civilization and resets it to a more barbarous time.  Mankind often reverts to medieval behavioral patterns and the resurgence of religion is often a major theme, as in that classic of the genre Canticle for Lebowitz.  By destruction of ordered civilization, the laws on humanity are revoked and man reverts to a might makes right scheme of interaction, making for romantic story telling and exciting yarns.  The Western genre is strongly akin to the post apocalyptic, although less compelling because in the western civilization is still somewhere, presumably.  Cormac Mcarthy has exploited both the western and post apocalyptic genre, tellingly.

Book of Eli is highly enjoyable, but not without the typical Hollywood leftist bias:  a black man rescues two Jewish women who are being held in sexual slavery by evil power-hungry white males.  He takes them to San Francisco, where together with homosexuals, they rekindle civilization together!",1508889600,,2030,4.826589595375722

4100181,3,B003A8FET6,"I didn't buy this video, I borrowed it from the library. Denzel Washington did an accomplished job, and it's the main reason I even give this review 3 stars. I feel that I was basically misled. I was curious about how this book Eli was carrying could be the ""wellspring of a revived society."" Other blather for the film said it could be the foundation of a renewed civilization, or something similar. So I was curious. But I watched through all of the butchery and heads flying off bodies (in self-defense, but still...) and then I began to get an edgy feeling when Eli started offering prayers while holding hands with a certain young lady. Finally, it was clear as day that Eli was carrying the Bible.
Why was he the only one in possession of a Bible? There should have been tons of them if he was traveling through the South or Midwest. But I stopped watching it in the last few minutes because I was pissed off by being misled, and that's the only reason I was patient with all of violence and bloodshed. As a freethinker myself,  I see nothing in the Bible to be the foundation of a new civilization. The Bible is full of rape, incest, slavery, massacres, infanticide and genocide, none of which were condemned by the God of the Bible. In fact, some of them were committed by God, or blessed or sanctioned by God, or ordered by God. Yes, I was raised as a Christian and I read the whole Bible, not just the cutesy warm-feeling passages. So I was outraged to think of a book like this being the wellspring of a revived society.
But if you are a believing Christian, you'll probably enjoy this film, and I won't try to discourage you. But if you're not a real Christian (not just in name only), I would advise you to skip this flick. Too much violence for so little justification.",1502409600,,1783,4.419452887537994

""KMART - Hello, My name is ELI""

the plot

Set in the United States in an unknown futuristic year after an apocalyptic war where few are left, Eli walks west on a mission from God. On his way he encounters many of the affected or their offspring, and has learned to handle himself amongst such dangerous packs of such fiends. During his travels, he finds that the former things of worth like gold and silver are now worthless. The things that people hold most highly are the things from before the war that help them survive in these hard days.

On one of his stops, he finds a bar where he goes to look for some water. It was here where he was involved in a bar room brawl between him and about ten men. When he defeated them all, Carnegie, the leader of this town, took him captive. Carnegie had been looking for a book that he could use to control many towns, as it will give him the right words, a Holy Bible. After the war, The Bible had become practically extinct because they were intentionally burned by men. Carnegie finds out that Eli has the last one in his possession, but by the time he finds out, Eli had been able to sneak out of his room and hit the road again. The pursuit of Eli and the book that he carries had begun.

the breakdown

For me, post-apocalyptic films are either hit or miss, but mostly miss. I like very few, something like Repo Men I enjoyed, yet something like I Am Legend was pretty good, and then there's crap like The Day The Earth Stood Still (2008). Well, that last one wasn't post-apocalyptic to be fair, but the apocalypse was looming, as Klaatu was its bringer. The Book of Eli is a good specimen of this genre. Although I almost gagged at the all-too political correctness at the very end, I enjoyed the story, the characters and the realistic situation.

Denzel Washington is an actor that is usually associated with real good (as far as I'm concerned) films. His very presence here in the title role of Eli is commanding and engrossing. His quiet disposition is only roused when provoked, a peaceful man in a time of uncertainty and a semi-mutant race's basic instinct is to continue a chaos that the destructive war was supposed to quench. He was dead-on perfect for this role. Gary Oldman is always a very good evil bad guy. His objective here as Carnegie is very evil, he is someone who wishes to control more towns than just his own, and possibly the whole country. Yet he knows he's not smart enough to accomplish this on his own and he searches for the bible which he calls a weapon that will give him the right words that will make people listen to what he has to say and do the things he wishes.

The very lovely Mila Kunis plays Solara, possibly named after an abandoned Toyota found on the side on the road by her mother Claudia played by Jennifer Beals. Claudia is the girlfriend of Carnegie, and Solara is kind of a serving wench/prostitute who answers like everyone in town, to Carnegie. Mila is one of the most beautiful actresses of Hollywood, her natural no-make-up look doesn't fail to impress for one second. Her acting was just as persuasive as the big names in this film.

The ending of the movie (without revealing any spoilers) felt inconsistant with the rest. It's almost as if there was possible another ending, and this sort of politically correct ending was tagged on at the last minute to maybe cover itself. The Bible was obviously a big part of the movie, and the protective power that followed Eli was evident. Yet for some reason the movie decided to totally downplay the book as just another lost book. I felt it was a cowardly way to end things. Also, one other thing about the ending just seems impossible, unless God were truly with Eli. Having seen the dopey ending, they make it seem unlikely. I apologize for this very cryptic last paragraph, but I really don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it.

The film was rated R for the violence and strong language. There was an abundance of violence in the movie, but not as much blood as I thought there'd be. Even with the ending, I watched the movie a few times and would probably check it out again. Three stars.

4100227,4,B003A8FET6,"This movie's setting is a post WWIII era.  People roamed the world as nomads, or lived in small towns.  Nations and Cities no longer existed.

After WWIII, people had blamed Christianity for the war.  Most Bibles burned in the war.  Most of the others were rounded up and destroyed. 30 years had passed since then.

Denzel Washington's character, Eli, had spent those decades protecting, what was probably, the last copy of the King James Bible on Earth.  Eli believed he'd been lead to that copy, and on Faith alone accepted the duty carrying it to a place it would be safe and honored.

Gary Oldman's character, Carnegie, saw the bible as a weapon.  He saw it as a way to dominate and manipulate the masses.  In other words, he wanted to abuse it's power and use it exactly the way that had caused it's near total destruction.

Eli was a warrior for God, and Carnegie was self serving, sadistic, bastard.

Eventually a young girl, named Solara joined Eli on his quest.  She was very beautiful, but he didn't see her that way.  She became his ward, his student, and eventually his successor.

The movie ended with Carnegie broken and defeated.  Eli died, but that wasn't a tragic ending,  He'd completed his mission, and was ready to rest.  Solara claimed Eli's weapons and tools for herself, and went to rescue those she loved.  A Warrior for God had fallen, and a Warrioress had risen.",1493769600,,1388,4.637860082304527

only he can be (extremely good actor) and a fascinating role for Jennifer Beals who plays a low
key and very evocative role.  If you hate post apocalyptic road films, but could imagine one being

Some have complained about lack of depth, pacing and the ending but I'm telling you it's an action-packed, thoughtful and passionate work with a stellar cast.

The Hughes Brothers (directors of Menace II Society) have an amazing visual flair for design and camera work. And as always Denzel is front and center driving things forward as he always does taking us right into his world and following him down any path (Glory, Fallen, Dj Vu, The Equalizer, etc.).

It's  more cerebral than Mad Max and less nihilistic than The Road (been hesitant to watch because I've heard its brutal and unrelentingly grim but will see at some point).

4100332,3,B003A8FET6,"Released in 2010 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""The Book of Eli"" is a post-apocalyptic thriller/drama about a man, Eli (Denzel Washington), who possesses a valuable book and is determined to go West. He comes across a desert town ruled by Carnegie (Gary Oldman) where he meets Solara (Mila Kunis) and her blind mother (Jennifer Beals). Carnegie wants the book at all costs whereas Solara wants to escape the town with Eli. Ray Stevenson plays Carnegie's main heavy while cutie Lora Martinez-Cunningham has a small role.

""The Book of Eli"" plays out like a Western mixed with the Mad Max flicks, but without the latter's goofiness. The New Mexican locations and colorless photography really capture the ambiance of a bleak post-apocalyptic world. Aside from the action and drama, the movie's basically a mystery. What is the book in Eli's possession? What makes it so powerful? Why do two people diametrically opposite in morality want it? Where is Eli taking the book and why? Why was Eli ""chosen"" for this mission?

While you'll easily guess some of the answers, the ending sheds additional light and will surprise you in some ways. Unfortunately, as the story unravels its flaws emerge. The script needed polished and some parts don't flow well. I share a couple of plot problems below, but here's an obvious one (no spoilers): Two travelers come across a house in the desert that has an ""Absolutely No Trespassing"" sign on the property. What good would such a sign do in a world where 95% of its inhabitants can't read?

Although the movie's burdened by such flaws, it's thought-provoking and there's enough good to marginally recommend it if you favor the cast and the genre.

The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in New Mexico and San Francisco Bay.

GRADE: B- (a strong 3/5 Stars or weak 4/5 Stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie).

One critic suggested that BOTH Carnegie and Eli are evil, obsessed with the possession of the book that destroyed society, but this is inaccurate. The movie goes out of its way to show that Eli is a noble individual -- not perfect, by any means, but goodhearted (Luke 6:45). Notice how he treats people respectfully unless threatened, he never molests Solara, etc.

And Eli wasn't obsessed with the possession of the book; he was simply determined to fulfill his mission, which required him to protect it until he brings it to the proper destination (""West""). He perceived his mission to be from God via the voice he heard that accurately led him to the surviving book. Why did God speak to Eli and not someone else? Because (1.) as noted above, Eli wasn't corrupt; and (2.) being blind he was more sensitive to blocking out noisy distractions to hear the ""still small voice.""

The movie also goes out of its way to illustrate that humanity without a religious book of any kind is WORSE THAN EVER -- preying upon each other like savage animals.

So the book itself didn't destroy society, but rather the corrupt intentions of the heart of evil people, like Carnegie (Oldman), who arrogantly wanted to use the book to CONTROL PEOPLE. He didn't care about the treasures of wisdom contained in the book, like Eli did (in view of his quotes from it, e.g. ""Do unto others...,"" ""live by faith, not by sight,"" etc.); Carnegie just wanted to use it to manipulate others.

So two people wanted the book, but one wanted it for wrong reasons and one wanted it for right reasons.

But there are obvious problems with the idea of God sanctioning the King James Version of the Bible as the lone representation of the Holy Bible on earth: It's a TRANSLATION of the original Hebrew & Greek Scriptures and, while a solid translation for its time period (the early 17th century), it's hardly a perfect translation and, furthermore, it's language is archaic to modern English-speakers, how much more so to people decades after the apocalypse?",1478131200,,3910,4.802083333333333

Denzel Washington is stellar in this movie and the twist really surprised me.  I don't get tired of watching this movie again from time to time.  I recommend this movie all the time and will continue to do so.  When our society moves past DVD's to whatever format is next, this is in my top 3 to make sure I have.

4100370,4,B003A8FET6,"I wish I didn't like dystopic films so much. A very depressing film. Of course, it has a hopeful message in the end. The plot is a little contrived as some cataclysmic war brings humanity so low it must scratch out a subsistence living. In the end, those that survived the immediate time after the cataclysm seemed to blame religion for the ""fall"" and attempt to wipe out all references to it.

Now, some years into the future, while men of ill-intent seek out these long since destroyed books to use the ""word"" against the weak minded, we find ourselves on a journey with a man who is walking the wasteland with what might be, the only copy of one such book with him as its guardian.

If you are religiously inclined, add a half star.

It is interesting though, to see Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour form the Harry Potter movies as a seemingly sweet old couple that turn out to quite heavily armed and not as sweet as they seem to be.",1473033600,,942,4.340909090909091

4100386,5,B003A8FET6,"This film is told like a biblical story.  A lone wanderer progresses through the vicious society that the world has become, intent on a mission that is gradually revealed to us. He is protected from the literal slings and arrows of those who would prey on him, but he is no passive penitent; instead he is more like a warrior monk with magical skills in the martial arts. The wanderer progresses, although no one else does, except for a young woman who insists herself into his company. Gary Oldman as Carnegie is the perfect wicked Biblical King, who is confronted at his end with the despair of his own Godless emptiness, his empire falling down around him. Eli is transformed into a kind of sainthood.  At the very end is Eli's prayer, which to me is an archetypal example of how one can converse with God.  At times the movie lapses into excessive detail of dark scenarios, but so do some of the books of the Bible.",1471478400,16,919,4.491017964071856

4100426,4,B003A8FET6,"I have always been a fan of post apocalyptic games and movies and wanted to see this when it came out. I only recently watched it and enjoyed it overall. It has a great cast of accomplished actors and well made sets that give you that post war look and feel.
The story has a basic plot about a wandering man with a special item that everybody wants to take from him. There are the usual elements of cruelty, abuse, and unrealistic Hollywood shootouts with guns that don't seem to need to be reloaded. There's the good guy that seems too good at times and then turns into a mass killer at the drop of a hat. There's also the bad guy that seems okay for a while but then turns into a crazed madman that doesn't seem to notice half the town has been wiped out as he goes on a crazy quest to hunt down Denzel's' character.
Like most movies of this type, there's very little information about the world these people live in which is a shame because it would make the stories more realistic and palpable and would answer the great questions like, ""who is making all of the bullets these guys are shooting"". The world seems to have no bibles after the war but thirty years plus, there's no end to ammunition.

That said, I recommend the movie primarily because of Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and the rest of the talented list of actors that appear in this film.",1467158400,3,1357,4.34251968503937

4100454,3,B003A8FET6,"Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, and Michael Gambon are fine in this odd movie, as are Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals -- but my goodness, all of them are capable of creating much more interesting characters than this odd movie allows -- odd because it's visually striking AND theologically incoherent, and this is a movie that seems to have a theological dimension, so the incoherence is damaging.  The plot has its surprises that I don't want to give away, so I can't fully tie the conceptual confusion to the plot in this review, but suffice it to say that if God operates in the way he seems to in this movie, then God is monstrous. What IS effective is the look -- we're thirty years post-apocalypse and are in either a world ruined by nuclear war or by environmental disaster -- or maybe God let loose ""the fire next time"" of the old song, but if he did, he didn't quite eradicate all the malefactors.  Gary Oldman has survived, and he wants to get his hands on the last surviving copy of the Bible, which Eli (Denzel Washington) has been charged (by God himself, it would seem) to carry to the west coast.  Suffice it to say that Eli makes it -- the ruins of San Francisco are marvelously recreated, with the Golden Gate Bridge a particularly picturesque ruin, and he and Solara (Mila Kunis), who makes the last part of the trip with him, end up meeting Michael McDowell in an Alcatraz that isn't quite what you expect.  The earlier visual effects, of the desert through which Eli and Solara travel, the ruined town where Gary Oldman holds sway like a scuzzy biker-gang leader, and the isolated house of a couple of unlikely-looking cannibals, are just as striking as those of San Francisco, and it's the visual ingenuity that holds your attention.  It has a comic-book quality oddly combined with reminiscences of old-fashioned Western movies.

The characters have no depth, and this story does not require them.  It's as if they (the characters, not the actors) are playing their parts in a kind of morality play.  But the actors are professionals, and they bring intensity to their roles as the only way of making things interesting.  Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman are always compelling to watch on the screen, and so it is here, even if we realize that they are capable of more than this movie asks of them.",1464220800,,2319,4.636585365853659

4100501,4,B003A8FET6,"THE BOOK OF ELI is yet another entry in the well-populated post-apocalyptic genre and, to be honest, doesn't do a lot to distinguish itself from its brethren. What makes it an interesting watch are the stylistic choices, well-executed action, and committed performances from a stellar cast. The plot concerns Eli (mentioned by name only once), who is headed west with the last copy of the Bible (in the US, at least). On his journey he meets a warlord (Gary Oldman) who has been looking for the book and wants to use it for his own purposes. From a narrative standpoint, THE BOOK OF ELI keeps things very simple, and even the characters aren't too well-defined, being more archetypes than anything else. Of course, this is mostly fine as the film has higher ideas on its mind than just providing a cool story. There was some passing mention of what caused the world to be the way it is, and attempts at fleshing out the finer details of the world in the film, but nothing on the level of what George Miller did with the MAD MAX franchise. What holds the film together is Denzel Washington, who has made a career out of playing men of action (and, occasionally, few words). He plays Eli with the cool detachment required, but also imbues him with a sense of humor and humanity that makes him a little more relatable. Gary Oldman also does fine as the villain, but his motivations (as well as Eli's ultimate goal) remain unfortunately broad and vague. Mila Kunis is the weak spot in the cast, and she can't quite hold her own against such heavyweights. Outside of Denzel, where the film really shines is the style and action. Although the film has the same de-saturated color palette common in the genre, it contributed positively to the lived-in feeling of the world it depicted. Everything (and everyone) was appropriately grimy and dirty, as it should be when the world has suffered from nuclear war. I also thought there was creative work in the action sequences, particularly the first one in which Eli takes on a group of hijackers. It took place mostly in silhouette, which gave it a comic book feel. In fact, this film would make an excellent graphic novel. Still, the film is not without its problems. The biggest one is the pacing, which stays a little on the slow side. Granted, there are necessary moments where the characters can interact, but the combination of dour visuals and a slow pace didn't really mesh well. Also, as indicated earlier, the vagueness with which character motivation is treated was a bit disappointing. What saves the film from mediocrity is a great payoff in the last 20-25 minutes. I won't spoil anything here, but I will say that it makes a lot of sense if you know your Bible stories. Ultimately, THE BOOK OF ELI is a solid, if unspectacular, entry in its genre, but Denzel Washington's performance, inventive action sequences, and examination of religion's societal role make it worth your time.",1459641600,6,2935,4.723196881091618

It is violent and not typical.  It has all kinds of stories within stories.  Too bad the critics did not like it.  Denzel shows us what a powerful actor he is.,1451520000,2,334,3.838235294117647

Gary Oldman playing the controlling, maniacal villain?  'Nuff said.",1451520000,,371,4.734375

4100607,4,B003A8FET6,"Denzel Washington delivers another excellent performance in this post-Apocalyptic thriller where man appears as doomed as can be and one outlawed book which was destroyed, could help turn things around.  Denzel's character Eli, is said to be in possession of this book.  Meanwhile criminal boss Gary Oldman hunts after Eli in pursuit of it.  There are many tense moments and well done fight scenes to go along with the steady plot.  This one doesn't move at the speed of light, but it's quiet moments are key to the story for the development of the characters which is nice.  I really enjoyed Washington's portrayal here, as he is a man on a mission who honestly doesn't look for trouble but definitely accepts his tough situations and deals with them with a swift hand.",1448668800,,770,4.803030303030303

(The Bible contain history of the past, from beginning to end, to put it simply.).Just a title of movie, which just shows the chronicles of Eli. Similar to Riddick, Eli kills when he has to defend himself, and he can be and is ruthless as any other men, only because of that situation he is in. Any one can surmise that Eli is or was a Christian, but did not depart from his belief in the Holy Bible. There are references. Quotes. I feel a sense of grittiness and mood change, but not depressing. I felt I was in it.  This movie is very, very, very good to watch.",1446940800,3,727,4.192857142857143

I actually watched this one twice the first time I ever saw it because I realized I had missed an important detail the first time through and wanted to see why and where I had missed that detail. The second time through was even better than the first because I picked up so many things and images and symbols that I had missed on the first time watching.

4100684,1,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli is, of course, the Bible.  The only saving grace in this movie is Denzel Washingtons acting.  He is superb.  This is post Apocalypse when the atmosphere opened and everything on the surface burned (sort of ).  Eli is heading West for reasons unknown except his claim of a message from God.  Or an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  The movie is mostly an excuse for gratuitous violence, a string of such scenes.  He is carrying a book West.  At one point he encounters a somewhat educated thug who rules a small town and is looking for a copy of the Bible.  He steals Elis.  Eli heads West.  It turns out it is a Braille Bible, so our thug cannot read it.  He remembers that the Bible was a book of power, and figures that if he could get one, he would have that power.  Poor sap!  Well, Eli and female companion finally reach the West Coast, and find a fortified and arm city on an island where they are attempting to restore civilization.  He has the Bible memorized, and dictates it.  He then dies, and female companion picks up his gear and heads East, for reasons not quite clear.
I was going to donate this movie to a book fair next month, but have decided that it is too inane and violent.  I will destroy it instead.  I do not understand why Denzel Washington made it.  Sad.",1441238400,,1295,4.343096234309623

Still, if you can look past that because of a similar belief in God--that is to say, if you believe there's more to life than meets the eye, that there's a guiding Hand and a path to be stepped out upon--then you will find a meaningful message here. That path does not always lead to life, as we know... and is not always so clear in purpose as the path walked by Eli.

4100843,5,B003A8FET6,"Fictitiously speaking, thirty years after the Apocalyptic War in America had ended, a ""Walker"" by the name of ELI, finds himself on a mandated mission. That being: To take the book that he's entrusted with - THE BOOK OF ELI, to the West Coast, for safekeeping and copying. And, as the film will clearly illustrate, that was easier said, than done. THE BOOK OF ELI - that he holds sacred within his being, carries with it a very powerful message. But, in the wrong hands, it could be used to gain unscrupulous control to manipulate the remaining populous. A mentally and emotionally warped - Warlord, a small time tyrant of a fragmented township, wants THE BOOK OF ELI so badly, that he is willing to buy all the available books and journals left to society and go so far as to kill whomever he has too, in order to take possessive ownership of THE BOOK OF ELI. But of course, he wants it for all of the wrong reasons. However, a mission bound ELI has persevered this far in his journey, that he is determined to get it into the right hands. If anything, to give hope to a seemingly hopeless and lifeless society. So, what is this book? This: BOOK OF ELI? What are it's contents? And what's the all important message contained within it, that would revive what's left of society? And why is ELI willing to risk his life, in order to successfully deliver THE BOOK OF ELI to the fortress island, located in the Pacific hemisphere? Academy Award-winning Actor - Denzel Washington, stars in the lead role of ELI and once again, absolutely mesmerizes the viewing audience in his portrayal. This big-screen, motion picture depiction is nothing short of 118-minutes of pulse-pounding action and adventure and riveting battles, that encompass the physical, mental, emotional and even, spiritual realms, in terms of warfare. To safely deliver THE BOOK OF ELI is an arduous odyssey with a great price tag to ELI, himself. But faithful ELI is determined to complete the course, come what may. This color, single-disc, DVD is... to say the least, unique and interesting. It is a compelling and entertaining movie that is also, thought provoking. A keeper for your DVD library collection.

4100846,5,B003A8FET6,"Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman star in this post-apocalyptic action drama about a man named Eli who walks alone in a terrible future. He walks west to California with a copy of The Holy Bible which has been used by societies galore for both good or evil in abundant ways either way. He guards it with extensive martial art skills and survival instincts. He displays heightened senses of smell and hearing at times as well which is explained near the end of the movie and the explanation is SHOCKING and unbelievable. America is now a brutal wasteland survived only by the fittest like hunters or by criminals and gangs. One leader of a crooked gang town wants the Bible to brainwash people into giving him their money and to kill for him ""in the Name of GOD"" which has been done many times before by more than one world group(do I even have to say the names of the groups?) in real life. Eli says he ""walks by faith and not by sight"". Wait until the near end of this movie to find out exactly what he meant. There is no supernatural happening in relation to it but the shock will hit you in the face. You will never ""see"" it coming!(hint). Rated R for violence. This is easily one of my favorite movies ever made and even with the flagrant Christian message, even if you are not religious, you will love it! Enjoy!",1428364800,,1317,4.401639344262295

4100898,4,B003A8FET6,"*NO SPOILERS*

The Book of Eli is an interesting tale of a post-apocalyptic world in which our hero (Denzel, of course) has to survive in a brutal environment while on his own personal quest. Of course, this quest is interrupted by our villan (Oldman) and Denzel is forced to use his formidable talents to defend himself and others along the way.

What I think I enjoyed most about this film was the sense of realism of the post-apocalyptic, Dust Bowl world. With Denzel and Oldman, you know you're gonna get some solid acting, and they don't disappoint. The fight sequences were, paired with well-written dialogue, pretty damn fun and appropriately violent - and by appropriate, I mean there is a lot of personal, close quarters fighting, not just ""spray and pray"" gun battles, given that ammo (and functioning firearms) are in realistically short supply.

With films that have been out for a few years, it's challenging to come up with anything that hasn't already been said. So, I hope this review helps you in making your decision whether or not to rent, via the little bits of personal observations I have here!",1424995200,,1116,4.802083333333333

Even though the post apocalyptic movies are a dime a dozen, The Book of Eli is original in presenting it's own take. In a world that has gone astray after a nuclear holocaust, Denzel's character has to take good care of the last known Bible in that world where only man makes his own rules.

We see how he fights for survival but also is shown how tough things can be in that society within a wasteland. It was okay overall story wise and the action was enough to keep me entertained.",1424044800,,568,4.154545454545454

Went in to theater with no expectations other than that Denzel pretty much always chooses good projects, so I felt confident the movie would be at least competent.

It's a little bit Mad Max, a little Dark Tower, etc. But, and this is the important part with any SF tale, imo, its thematic reason for being is not one I've ever seen explored before.

4100925,4,B003A8FET6,"I had watched this movie before and thought it was an interesting post-apocalyptic tale with many believable elements and some plausible ones- like books being burned and/or banned and the people who did this being consumed by the Apocalypse.
Good performances by Washington and Oldman and, surprising- to me- Kunis",1422662400,,315,5.32
4100926,3,B003A8FET6,"The music score is great, but to tout the Judaeo-Christian Bible as THE solution to mankind's destructiveness is absurd.  The Bible hs been used as an excuse for massacres, wars, discrimination, and destruction.  Ever hear of the Inquisition, the massacre of Protestants in France, pogroms, and Nazis?  Gimme a break.  The Bilble is long.  You cn find whatever you want in it.  Furthermore, we all read translations of it. None of it was originally written in English, and translations of the ancient Hebrew of the Old Testament and the old Greek of the New Testament differ according to what the translator wanted to preach.",1422230400,,625,4.961538461538462

4100944,5,B003A8FET6,A movie that makes one think.  Highly recommend.,1420934400,,48,5.0
4100945,4,B003A8FET6,"Ignoring the obvious and superficial Christian emphasis of the underlying plot, this film superbly chronicles one man's pilgrimage to take the only surviving copy of the bible to the last bastion of civilisation (in America, that is) surrounded by the barbaric degeneration of the few survivors of the apocalyptic event. Interestingly, there are undertones of anti-Christianity running through the plot; all of the bibles, bar one, were destroyed after the event that, presumably, Christian fundamentalism had somehow caused; and Gary Oldman's character`s desperate attempt to obtain the bible as a means to control the populace (opium for the masses, anybody?).

The film is dark, grim and unrelenting, shot with almost monochrome harshness. Denzel Washington's performance was brilliant as was Gary Oldman's (has he ever played a goodie?) and the cameo appearances of Frances de la Tour and Michael Gambon were delightful. The storyline was engaging and, without the usual Hollywood formulaic sloppy bits, perfectly matched the moody cinematography.

All-in-all, an excellent film superbly cast and peppered with just enough mysticism & symbolism - a worthy addition to the post-apocalyptic movie genre. The only criticism may be that every character was a bit of a caricature and that, really, the genre hasn't evolved much beyond Thunderdome.",1420934400,,1346,5.560975609756097

He is asked by a voice to deliver his copy of a mysterious book that could hold the key to the survival of the human race to a safe location. The Hughes brothers - Albert and Allen - directs the film.

This film is somewhat hard to sit through as it is uneven and far from enjoyable. It does not know exactly its genre for it is a road movie, a disaster movie,a horror movie and an adventure movie all rolled into one apart from being about the post-apocalyptic film. Nevertheless,it does not fail in style. As for the story,it is far from interesting unless one really is a lover of action movies. But the Hughes brothers did not fail the viewer in terms of style.

4101056,5,B003A8FET6,"The movie is multi-layered, blending myth, metaphor, mysticism and mayhem in a post-apocalyptic America. Eli walks his path, guided by the voice of a God only he can hear. He knows only that he will be guided to his goal, which lies... west.

He survives in a violent world by using violence as a tool, yet he is clearly not by nature a violent man. We see him witness a murder and rape from a vantage point, yet he does nothing. In time we understand that his mission is to get the book to its unknown destination, not to right every wrong.

Denzel Washington delivers a superb performance. Scrupulously paying by trade or barter for so much as a drink of water, he moves through a world that does not abide weakness. In the end his greatest strength lies in his simple incorruptibility.",1413849600,,788,4.503496503496503

4101083,4,B003A8FET6,"This movie is just plain strange. It's a beautifully shot post-apocalyptic narrative set 30 years after ""the blast,"" and the filmmakers did a great job running everything through color-depriving filters. Scavengers scavenge, rats feed on the scraps, and taking a page from the Mad Max script, thugs do the bidding of a nasty boss.

So that's all good, but then there is this little theme which keeps coming up and growing and then coming up some more: good old Denzel is on a mission from God and hell bent to deliver the last remaining copy of the Bible to, well, Alcatraz.

So yeah, as many of the other reviewers noted, the film gets a little off the tracks toward the end, but if you can ignore the fact that it's some version of Christian propaganda, the portrayal of life after ""the blast"" is pretty killer.",1412294400,,813,4.6

We've come to expect stellar performances from these great veteran actors and they do not disappoint.  I've liked Mila Kunis since 'That Seventies Show' and she's grown into a very talented actress.  She really hit the ball out of the park with her role as Solara. Her transformation from a timid victim to an almost Paladin-like protector was for me, very believable.
The story is good, the acting is very good, the action is good and I was thoroughly entertained and eager to watch it again (it was even better the second time). Of course some say that I'm easily entertained; that's a good thing, right? :)",1412121600,,700,4.637096774193548

First off the bible is a Catholic book. #1 the King James Version is missing the 7 books that Martin Luther an angry catholic removed, returning it to the Hebrew translation .#2 You would need the ""Greek Translation to be accurate."" So the plot of the movie is ruined. The ""King James Version was printed in the ""16th century."" Duh, Missing the books: Tobit, Judith, Wisdom,,Sirach, Baruch, 1st Maccabees and 2nd Maccabees. The Hebrew translation is not valid because it is missing the seven books as said earlier.#3 They were removed my ""Man"" not God. The Greek translation was used by the Jews well before Christ and when the Jews converted they still used this translation. People continue today to try and change the bible by ""Gender Neutralizing"" every word or phrase they can. All you haft to do is research to find the answers.

4101118,5,B003A8FET6,"Extremely well done post-apocalyptic tale of a man, on foot, walking through the Mad Max aftermath of a nuclear-devastated American Southwest, 30 years after the lights went out. Most of those born afterwards cannot read or write, and Eli possesses a mysterious Book and a mysterious destination.
Along the way, he has encounters and makes choices.

Denzel Washington is very good in this...perfect casting actually, and his character's quiet integrity supports the whole structure of the film. Gary Oldman is interesting as the villain, a local two-bit warlord running a dusty little Bartertown in the middle of nowhere who wants what Eli is carrying. Jennifer Bealls (Flashdance) has a small but interesting key role as Oldman's blind concubine who senses just how different Eli is from the usual drifters and riffraff of Bartertown.

We gradually see that Eli is a man of character, of resolve and of spiritual faith. Hollywood and especially SF have been so openly and antagonistically anti-faith for so long that this comes as a great surprise in an SF/postapocalyptic film.
Eli's quiet faith is very well done, and it's portrayed honestly without condescension or disavowal by the screenwriters. That's really refreshing, and it makes the film all the more likable. Because despite all the Mad Max bleakness and despite that virtually all the Bartertown riffraff are brutal thugs (and/or closet cannibals)-- this is a deeply likable movie, one you enjoy spending time in, and that's a credit to both Denzel's portrayal and to the script.

By all means see this. I don't buy as many films as I used to, but this is one I'm glad to own. I expect to watch it several times a year. It's a good film to watch as a group, or a family. This film is not a waste of your time...and what a pleasure it is to be able to say that.

Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, everybody.",1410048000,,1872,4.840625
4101119,4,B003A8FET6,This is one of the more  interesting post apocalyptic movies I've seen. Denzel turns in an almost flawless performance given you bend the accuracy of the script.

Denzel Washington played Eli as if he himself believed in him.  His portrayal borders on religious, it's that good.  This movie belongs in a select category of very special films.

The Book of Eli is a quest story.  It's a story of hope along th  lunes of Costner's The Postman.  This is definitely worth seeing.",1405641600,,510,4.467391304347826

THE BOOK of ELI is well-acted and well-shot, but the fact that blind Eli (Denzel Washington) is virtually indestructible, something that's revealed early-on when he easily prevails against multiple armed assailants, kind of kills the suspense.

With only faith to go on, Eli lives for God and whenever failure may present itself, he does not blame God, he realizes his mistake and God's correction. He fully trusts in God to protect him in this journey.
This is an excellent movie of faith and a full trust in God. All while having a great storyline and awesome action scenes with actors of amazing talent.

4101239,3,B003A8FET6,"Definitely not a bad movie, but not great either.  The fight scenes were pretty good, the cast were mostly good as well.  For a while I couldn't figure out why it was so important for Oldman's character to get his hands on the last known copy of the bible.  Then I thought about it for a little while and then it dawned on me.  Oh, the damage he could've done with that book!  What's really unfortunate is that Eli was blind to the damage that the book caused in the hands of man.  At one point, it's mentioned that religion was part of the cause of the war.  And this dude goes off and delivers it to someone who prints books!  And of course, man has a habit of not learning from his mistakes, so there goes another opportunity for some lunatic to create a christian army and finish off the rest of the planet.  The reprinting of the book is probably the most sad part of the story.",1396051200,,883,4.177514792899408

Denzel performs great marshal arts moves defending against evil men. The point of the movie was that he was to take the Bible, the most loved book in all the world, to a safe place where it can be printed over & over. Those of us that read the Bible, like the divine protection given to men who do God's will.

I'm not a religious person in any traditional sense, but I must say it is refreshing to see Hollywood make a movie about a man's faith in his deity's destiny for him..  The prayer at the end of the movie was, for lack of a better word, touching:  It conveyed the idea of humility.  That is, Eli accepted his place in the great scheme of things as a vessel for a larger purpose; and he was thankful for the opportunity to serve in that capacity.

4101314,5,B003A8FET6,This was the most amazing movie ever. We watch this as often as we can. There is always something in this movie that we had missed the last time and it never gets old. Such an amazing actor doing a very wonderful job in this.,1388620800,,225,4.022222222222222

4101316,5,B003A8FET6,"Great movie.  LOVE IT!  I'll happily watch this one again and again.  Once a quarter works for me!  It's one of those movies you thoroughly enjoy sharing with others.  you want to sit and watch their reactions as they see it for the first time.  There aren't too many movies with Denzel that I don't like...but it's not due to a man-crush...he's just that good (and he doesn't seem to sign up for bad movies).  That said, this is definitely one of my favorites of his, and one of my favorites, period.",1388448000,,501,4.380434782608695

4101319,5,B003A8FET6,"This movie is full of moral messages.  I recommend it for all viewers though some of the material might be too much for younger kids.  Denzel Washington portrays the main character with great power, conviction and charisma and is for sure the embodiment of moral rectitude and determination responding only to attacks on his person as he makes his way to a place where he can share the bible among people who have survived the apocalyptic destruction of civilization.",1388102400,,467,4.89873417721519

4101321,5,B003A8FET6,"Pay no attention to the bad reviews.  Some people just don't know what they're talking about.

4101323,5,B003A8FET6,"Denzel is great in this action packed movie toting a Bible, the last copy on earth.  He has the moves of David Carradine, and his Faith protects him against all odds.  The end of the movie is a surprise, get this movie.  You'll be glad you did.",1387497600,,244,4.148936170212766
4101324,5,B003A8FET6,The post-apocoliptic setting reminded me of the Mad Max movies. The major difference though is this story has a Plot.,1387152000,,117,4.9

4101329,4,B003A8FET6,Denzel Washington shines in this post war movie about saving the last known Bible after all bibles had been destroyed as a lead up to the almost total annihilation of mankind. A rewarding ending. Violent but not overboard.,1386460800,,222,4.868421052631579
4101330,5,B003A8FET6,"It amazes me how the future is depicted, always dark, full of selfish people who have no real purpose and this movie addresses purpose. Eli is on commission to bring a Bible, a nearly extinct book to safe harbor in a whole that is self destructive and lost. A power hunger guy who knows how the Bible might be used to manipulation the masses and is willing to kill to have that power. Corruption verse hope, a the true meaning of purpose. One blinded by ambition and one with a vision for the future.",1386288000,,500,4.329787234042553

4101339,4,B003A8FET6,Denzel is always watchable.  Sort of a formula movie with a little twist.  The ending of the movie is so cloying I had to look the other way.  Max Max gets religion and a renaissance is born.,1384646400,,191,4.108108108108108

4101344,3,B003A8FET6,"I try to find decent Christian movies for prison inmates to watch as a group and I went ahead an ordered this one. I'm not sure if I am going to submit this one yet. I enjoyed it on a surface level, it had that Clint Eastwood feel to it. the initial violence was maybe over the top, but in a world where men have resorted to bestial behavior, what can you expect.
The Biblical message was pretty good and I loved the fact that it promoted Scripture memorization.

Simple, cheesy, good for a view.",1383782400,,496,4.221052631578948

The Blu-ray Steelbook packaging is a great wat when storing the item but will take a bit more room. Only the finest films are on Blu-ray Steelbook so this one is good.

4101367,5,B003A8FET6,This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  At first I thought it was just another macho post-apocalyptic study in violence but by the end I was won over by the subtle and not so subtle morality play inserted within.

The streaming quality is awesome as well! I had no trouble buffering this on a PS3 console. I would definitely rent this again! I also recommend to pay the extra dollar to rent it in HD.

4101381,5,B003A8FET6,"If you want to think beyond religion, and stay religious, this will make you believe. The cast is Denzel and those who follow him. The script makes you understand the importance of where we are right now, and what may come. The setting brings you future to past, then tempts you with our current life. The plot shows you the now, the past and the future. As a semi-religious, grown in the South individual, this movie resonates on any level of faith. Not because it was biblical or not, but because it drives home a point of faith, self righteousness and powerful thinking. It's an apocalyptic documentary that rounds up the church choir. Action packed, with meaning that makes you think. Loved it from the start and astounded at the end. One of my favorite movies for intelligent action. Absolutely loved it.",1377734400,,809,4.704225352112676

4101383,4,B003A8FET6,"Evil bad guys in a post apocalypse world?  Well no surprise there.  This movie is superbly cast and shot.  The desolation and desperation in the post apocalyptic portrayal is done well.  The scenes are not crowded with detail, it seems Kubricesque at times in it sparseness, but there is still plenty to take in in the sets and backdrops. This film is well worth seeing for its vision alone.  Denzel is aging well as an actor, and gosh I sure hope his age is augmented for the films sake because I hate to think of him getting old!  There are few surprises in the plot, as neither the theme is new, nor the way the plot unfolds; and I think we've all seen visions of the end of the world enough to get the idea.  Still, as science fiction goes, this is a pretty good movie.  I like it.  But if hope has to be peddled to the post-apocalypse masses in the form the book used, I think a good preacher would really make the difference.",1377561600,,931,4.244318181818182

Of all of Denzel Washington's movies, this is by far my favorite. Near the end, when the character's personal challenge was revealed, I was floored. It gave a new meaning to ""walk by faith"".

I loved the plot twists and the undertones of cool exuded by Denzel. Rockin' movie all-in-all.

How do you control the humidity for all the manuscripts in a rotting old prison that was closed 40 years ago because the environment was rotting it away?
The actions sequences save the movie and though it is nowhere near Denzel Washingtons best movie neither is it his worse.

Watch the whole movie and listen and watch carefully...until the very end. Then look at your own life....Are you being told to walk west with something? Are you doing so or have you been distracted?
Great acting from all in this too. And the messages are so true, ""We wasted what we kill for now."" (something like that).

4101444,3,B003A8FET6,"The story is set in an apocalyptic America, thirty years after a devastating war. Washington plays the lead who is wandering `west' to deliver a book of great power. He is a fearsome warrior who deals very violently with the assortment of cannibalistic thugs who roam the roads. The crux of the story is his encounter with Gary Oldman, who is trying to re-establish civilization, though his methods aren't  terribly civilized. Oldman wants the book and Washington refuses. More violence.

The basic story is not new. Many stories have explored the dim days following the collapse of order and the scavenging needed to survive. Human principles are disgarded by almost everyone and cannibalism is the new fast food. The fresh element here is religion. Washington has a purpose greater than personal survival and he must defy the forces that seek to exploit it. Even so, it is at best only average fair. The fight scenes aren't too special and if you think about it too much, there are some perplexing plot issues.

Personally I welcomed the religious element, though I suspect it's not developed sufficiently for the faithful, and it's probably still too much for those who are resistant. It was kinda undone for me anyway in the last scene. The gore and sexual elements are reasonably limited, though there's a bit of language at times (THAT word will apparently outlive anything!).

We just wanted to have a post-apocalyptic marathon and thought this movie might work.

For the most part all we could notice was how horrible the depictions of women were and how much superfluous rape there was. We stopped watching after Mila Kunis was rescued and jumped gratefully into Denzel Washington's arms.

This portrayal of women is pretty unacceptable considering the movie was made in 2010. I mean really, I thought we were leaps and bounds ahead of this ""damsel in distress"" stereotype, the idea that men are monsters who can't control themselves, and the notion of women being used for barter. What the hell?

The most frustrating thing is that some might think: ""This is a 'realistic' portrayal of what would actually happen in a post-apocalyptic world."" Because it's so realistic for a blind 50 year old man to be able to take down 10 twenty-something guys single-handedly, right? I just think it's messed up and really lazy for people to continue to exploit rape for entertainment purposes, in this day and age. Do better, Hollywood.",1371859200,2,1171,4.84

4101462,2,B003A8FET6,"I enjoy movies and books about the end of the world/civilization and looked forward to watching this movie.  I ended up renting it from Amazon, paying about what the film was worth.  My overall impression was that the film was having a hard time deciding the optimal mix of ripping off ""The Road,"" ""The Road Warrior,"" Clint Eastwood westerns and various superhero films. Alert: spoilers below!

Pluses:

Good if somewhat stoic performance by Denzel.  Fairly realistic depiction of post-apocalypse cities, deserts and coastal areas.  I enjoyed the stylized action piece under the bridge early in the film, along with cat ambush at the beginning. The scene with the cannibal couple (prior to the arrival of the thugs) was well done.  The central theme of the power of the Bible, Christianity and faith was handled well.

Minuses:

Poor exposition.  What happened 31 years ago?  Why are so many people blind?  Where did Eli's extensive scars come from?  How is he so good a shooting, fighting and knifing people?

Lack of realism.  Eli would need much more water than he apparently carried to cross the distances he did.  He is not going to get too far on that one cat, either.  The big disaster happened 31 years ago and there is no electrical grid, yet there are lots of vehicles are still running around with plenty of gas.  Gas goes bad within months, so there would need to be some refining going on the keep all of them running.  No shortage of ammunition, either.  The bad guys are running around with full-auto weapons with little regard for conserving ammo (or hitting the target).  Not much discipline with fires at night, either.  When they camped in the ruined cooling tower, a poor choice for several reasons, Denzel builds this giant fire that would have been visible through the gaps in the tower for miles.  As for Mila Kunis, she is too pretty for the apocalypse.  Her tight jeans and platform boots were interesting choices for going on road.  And who taught her how to drive?  Oh, and how is that the bad guys don't have enough gas to pursue, but Mila and Denzel can drive their armored Suburban all the way to San Francisco?  Then there is the rowing to Alcatraz.  Uh, not that easy.  The list goes on.  Even in a fantasy there needs to be some ability to suspend disbelief and stay the world being presented.  Not so much in this film.

Who should see this film? Denzel fans and those really interested in seeing depictions of an apocalyptic world.",1370649600,,2466,4.675990675990676

4101480,4,B003A8FET6,"Once again, Denzel Washington nails the role of Eli.  While yet another post-apocalyptic story, the overall plot for this one is more entertaining than most.  I originally saw this one on my laptop inside my big rig, having downloaded it via a cellular modem, and it remains a part of my digital library to this day.  It looks far better on my 42 inch TV at home, connected to my laptop via an HDMI cable, than it did on the much smaller 17 inch screen on my laptop, but both viewings were great.

This one is rated R due to frequent due to especially brutal and graphic violence, and for some reason for the language used (kids hear worse in school and from their parents).  I wonder sometimes about how and why they rate movies the way it is done, given that I've seen movies with far more violence and course language get PG-13 ratings.

As I said, Denzel Washington plays the main character and hero of the movie, a wandering warrior on a mission named Eli.  Gary Oldman's acting as the bad guy is spot on.  The supporting roles by Jennifer Beals (Flashdance, The L Word) and Mila Kunis (""Jackie"" on That 70's Show, ""Meg Griffin"" on Family Guy) is equally superb.  The story centers around an obsession by the bad guy over books, one particular book he wants being carried by our hero.  I'm not going to reveal the twist to you, you'll have to figure that one out for yourself (I refuse to write spoilers into my reviews).",1368576000,,1426,4.42911877394636
4101481,5,B003A8FET6,"Without giving away the plot twist, this was one of the most well done movies I have seen in a long time.  Denzel Washington did a great job, as he usually does in his acting.  But the surprise of the movie will not be revealed to you until near the very end of the movie.  A great story which is not buried in special effects.",1368230400,,327,4.0

4101483,4,B003A8FET6,I like Denzel Washington and he does a good job in this movie.  Also the price of the DVD and the time it took to ship were good.,1367625600,,129,3.607142857142857
4101484,4,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli(released Jan/10)is a work directed by the Hughes Brothers and stars,among others,Denzel Washington,Gary Oldman,Jennifer Beals,Tom Waits and Roddy McDowell. The movie is about a man on a mission,who doesn't stop until the job is done.
The story is set in a post apocalyptic world,where desolation,isolation and deprivation are the daily routine. Washington(Eli)with a keen sense of smell,taste and hearing,is ""heading west""on a personal trek to get a copy of the King James Version of the Bible to the West coast. It is a book he reads religiously(no pun intended)every day. Not only are his senses keenly developed but his fighting skills match or out do even those. He has been on his walkabout for thirty years now and one wonders why he hasn't gotten to the west coast long before that. The story will tell us,but all in due time.
Eli has had to endure,among mnay other hardships,bandits along his journey and the movie starts out with one such ambush,which he ""defuses"" in quick order. He wanders into a derelict town run by Oldman. Oldman is a voracious reader but there is one book he wants to possess and that is what,unbeknownst to him,Eli carries. Oldman finds Eli is a man he needs to help run his town,but Eli is not interested. Oldman ""invites"" Eli to stay the night but Eli bolts before sunrise. A""companion"" that is sent in to bed Eli goes nowhere,but the girl does indicate the next day that he carries the book matching the one Oldman wants. Oldman and the gang manage to catch him just as he is leaving and the ensuing shoot out still doesn't stop him,leaving Oldman wounded in the process.
Eli makes it to a house in the middle of nowhere where an older couple are holed up. Oldman of course wants that book. He pursues and catches up to Eli at the house. It is here that Eli's book and he part company,and Eli is shot in the stomach and left for dead. The""companion"" goes after Eli and finds him some time later miraculously walking westward on the open highway. Together they finally make the west coast. In fact they reach San Fransisco and row out to Alcatraz. There there is a colony run by McDowell,who are preserving all audio,visual and written forms of communication pre-apocalypse. In cut scenes back and forth between Eli at Alcatraz and Oldman back in his town,we see the latter finally getting the book opened and seeing....nothing he can ""read"",because it is written in braille! In Alcatraz we see Eli sitting down with McDowell and dictating the entire Bible to him. Using old printing presses,a book is produced and carefully shelved among other pieces of religious material. As the film ends Eli has passed away and his companion is wearing some of his accoutrements as she heads back home.
The film is shot entirely in a washed out sepia tone and proves quite effective is setting a certain feeling and look throughout. While the premise is certainly interesting I found the going could get a little on the slow side at times,and the ending of the film especially got a little more drawn out than it should have. Remember we are dealing with a subject matter here that has been done over and over again,especially in the past few years,so I was personally looking for something special that would set this one apart from all the rest. I really didn't find much. However Washington does his usual good job in his role and he is ably assisted by the likes of Tom Waits,Oldman and McDowell in a small role near the end. Watch for Jennifer Beals in a surprise and nice role as Oldman's woman. Also for you Harry Potter fans,look closely at that old couple in the house...nuff said.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/a a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a deleted/alternate scene and a comic/cartoon about the back story to Oldman's charcater with the voices of Oldman and Washington.
All in all another in a long line of post apocalyptic films with a very good cast and some surprise cast members. But it is not original enough to set it apart/elevate it from all the others. Interesting story but only 3 1/2 stars.",1367625600,,4089,4.6884561891516
4101485,5,B003A8FET6,"I thought it might be a cult type movie but it turned out to be an action / drama movie with just enough twists in it to keep you thinking, but not thinking too hard.  I could have done without the Koran at the end but realize the point of saving all available knowledge.",1367107200,,271,4.018518518518518
4101486,5,B003A8FET6,"This movie was hard to get into but sticking with it was a great experience.  A friend recommended it (a die-hard Denzel fan).  I had to watch it twice because there was so much going on that I felt as though I missed some of it.  I'm glad I did that because there is so much there.  As a Christian, I was intrigued by what being told here.",1367020800,,340,3.9558823529411766
4101487,4,B003A8FET6,"It's a pretty good saga of the OId West in modern gab, with tricky knife and hand play added to the traditional gun shoot 'em up. The problem is that almost any young version of the myriads of gunfighters in the Old West could have played the role just as well. While we get a bit of the quality Denzel Washington always brings to the screen, and very good bits they are, still he is wasted in most of the film. (Granted there appear to be financial reasons in his being Co-Producer to account for his starring but that is irrelevant to what appears on the screen). At any rate, as it stands, there is enough action to keep most action fans happy, a real nasty with his brutal gang, a couple of women to visually enliven the screen, and the appealing sound of Washington's voice, to make this an acceptable way to spend an evening (for those who go for the average Western or other varieties of mixing it up by the boys)
Naturally, given the name of the film there is the religious aspect as one would expect. Since such elements in the movies elicit responses from different parts of the audience which I cannot predict, it is to mention here and left to the viewer to decide how they might react to soft-sell approaches to religious belief.",1366934400,,1242,4.404347826086957
4101488,5,B003A8FET6,This is a terrific movie with Denzel Washington pretty much kicking butt (kill) and not bothering to take names of anyone who gets in his way of his goal to take his book West. Gary Oldman plays his his role as bad-guy wonderfully.,1366934400,,231,4.395348837209302

4101498,4,B003A8FET6,"This is set in a post-apocalyptic U.S. that is very gloomy and hopeless. Denzel Washington plays Eli, who reminds you of the ultimate warrior on a quest for a holy graile. He is unstoppable as he overcomes obtacles in his journey west across the country, the worst being a tribal gang leader (of sorts) who is in a desperate search for a copy of the Bible. His scheme is to build a religious fiefdom of survivors who will cow at his scripture-quoting silver tongued oratory. Eli has the last copy known to exist and is unshakable in pursuing his mission, seeing his rival for the huckster that he is. The plot stands up. Great irony is portrayed through the post-nuclear holocaust world. One of the better lines delivered by Eli is telling a young woman (Mila Kunis) about the world before. ""We had so many things. We didn't know what was valuable and what wasn't. We threw away things that people now will kill another person to get.""

It is dark and the scenery is ugly. That was intentional but hard to give it 5 stars for all of that.",1365811200,,1038,4.463157894736842

4101530,3,B003A8FET6,"The setting of this movie is post-apocalyptic America, 31 years after ""the Flash"" (a catastrophic event).  The first ten or so minutes show us Denzel Washington as Eli, traveling alone and hunting through a bleak, gray wasteland, carrying the world's last Bible westward to safety based on a message from God.  And those first ten or so minutes show how fascinating movies can be with little or no dialogue (or, in this case, monologue).  As the story progresses, Eli encounters various jittery roadside bandits, who capture, kill and eat passersby . . . unless that passerby is Eli, of course, who has lightning-like reflexes and is handy with bows and arrows, machetes and guns.

Roughly an hour into the movie, Eli comes upon a fairly well-established town run by Carnegie (actor Gary Oldman) and his henchmen, led by the ""Rome"" series' Ray Stevenson.  Carnegie is looking for the very book that Eli is carrying, for Carnegie recalls its power to sway men, et cetera et cetera et cetera.  While the story still has quite a bit of steam going at this point, it does turn into a bit of standard one-man-versus-many action fare with a few unexplained plot holes I won't explore here.

Now keep in mind the entire world was just destroyed by a nuclear holocaust because of the BS in that book. And after the nuclear holocaust humans burned every KJ bible they could locate to prevent such madness from repeating itself. So why in the world would it be so dammed important to do it all again? Stupid humans obviously do not learn from their mistakes! Denzel plays a great part well acted but will now be to blame for round two of human stupidity. The warlord should have shot him in the head.

There is a modicum of catharsis derived from the Bible (the objective correlative of Washington's Eli character) and the notions of faith, but not enough to compensate for the rather ad-hoc and dull series of scenes.  This movie is as lifeless and devoid of charm as a post apocalyptic future.",1360108800,3,463,4.848101265822785

4101565,4,B003A8FET6,"I was circumspect about this movie when I first read the reviews but I was desperate for science fiction so I decided to go for it. Besides, I love both Denzel Washington and Malcolm McDowell so it seemed like it might be worth the risk.

At first I was disappointed. I burned out on the Mad Max genre in the eighties and that's what this looked like. Ten minutes in I almost turned it off because the stark colors in the landscapes were actually making me sick to my stomach. However, the fight scenes were well done so I stuck with it.

After a while, I was hooked. The strength of Washington's character, the spiritual overtones, and the mystery behind his journey really kept me intrigued. The draw was similar for me with the Battlestar Galactica reboot: people writhing around in squalor and filth, reduced to their most base nature, devoid of hope, and yet still a few manage to rise above it and remember what's important. It's what we all hope we'll do when and if we wake up one day and find the grocery store shelves empty and the bodies of our friends and neighbors scattered about: be a human being and not an animal.

There are some minor flaws. Where did they get all that gas? Why are there so many well fed people? But let's not pick nits. It's a good film and it will leave you with a good feeling.",1357948800,,1316,4.363265306122449

The book ""The Alchemist"" for example, I found absolutely unreadable. HOWEVER, this film is so cool that I DON'T CARE. Despite the use of established common roles for all the characters, nearly the same as any cookie-cutter samurai movie, the typical 'twists' throughout and at the end, 'the journey', and the hero, drawn up as a hybrid of Zatoichi and Yojimbo . . . despite all that, it was kind of refreshing. There's no attempt to disguise the common mechanics I just noted.

madness...and he's on a mission for God.  I'll be using my copy to create ""movie night"" in my family.  I plan to
have my kids and grandkids to get together once a month to have ""movie night""; beginning with The Book of Eli..  I

4101622,5,B003A8FET6,"""The Book of Eli"" is an excellent post-apocalyptic tale in a similar vein of ""Mad Max"" and the more recent ""The Road"".  In fact, I would recommend watching ""The Road"" and this in the same sitting, as they compliment each other.  While ""Road"" is more realistic in terms of survival in that type of setting, ""Eli"" is the more adventurous and action oriented.  Very fine performances of everyone involved, and Denzel skillfully plays a man with a very distinct mission at hand.  This is one of the few movies by the very underrated Hughes Brothers (see ""From Hell"" with Johnny Depp to see what other excellent work they are capable of) and the first one they have done in a long time.  There is a very distinct religious overtone to the movie, but if you read between the lines it leaves it to the viewer to decide if things happen due to pre-destination or by chance.

The performances were stellar, of course.  Denzel Washington plays a convincing anti-hero, and Gary Oldman plays yet another unforgettable villain.  Seriously, I can still picture him in my mind.  Also, some of the scenes were beautifully photographed.

But overall, the script put me off.  Post-apocalypse type movies and books attract me because they are typically thought-provoking.  What would the world be like if some huge disaster were to befall us?  How would people survive?

In this genre, my suspension of disbelief is limited.  But your suspension has to be pretty high to watch this thing.  It's fine in a Bruce Lee movie when six guys get dispatched by a single swordsman, even if it looks choreographed and cheesy.  Here, however, it makes no sense.  It just makes the writer look lazy and unimaginative.

People compare it to other Dystopian movies - Mad Max and the like. Well, all post-apocalyptic Dystopian movies will share many similarities, from the dust-shrouded sky to dead vegetation, wandering gangs to small outposts run by the strongest and best armed. ""The Book of Eli"" does a better job than most. The environment is fantastic and believable, the de-evolution of society and technology dead-on. All colors are muted, almost sepia toned. Everything is gritty and dirty. Shampoo is worth it's weight in gold.

We don't see crumbling skylines - until the end. We don't explore dead cities. We join Eli at the end of a decades-long journey, and see a glimpse of the possible future.  I could have done without the religious rhetoric and Oldman's character (Carnegie) believing that the book is the answer to everything and the source of all power. Denzel Washington gave a surprisingly good performance outside his ""comfort zone"", and the sexy Mila Kunis was a believable supporting character. The cast had plenty of other well known actors, from Jennifer Beals to Ray Stevenson, plus a decent supporting cast.

Every character was well cast and acted - none seemed out of place (think Matt Le Blanc in ""Lost in Space"" or John Wayne as Genghis Khan).

I would, however, like to add one more component to the list - I left the movie thinking about the vast capabilities that each human being (you and me) has within him/herself for great goodness or for great evil.  Even Eli, himself, must struggle with this paradox.
A couple of G.K. Chesterton quotes, I think, reflect this same take-away from 'The Book of Eli':
""Man seems to be capable of great virtues but not of small virtues; capable of defying his torturer but not of keeping his temper.""

I've been told there's a lot of biblical stuff in the movie, but as I am not versed in the bible, I was not able to discern anything. I am curious however to what some of it is and will probably do a quick research as it may help me 'get' the movie a little better.

Being somewhat of a neutral person when it comes to religion, I enjoyed the movie as just what it was, a movie. And if it makes you feel any better, one of the Hughes Brothers is an atheist. So if an atheist can direct a film about the power of the Bible, everyone should be able to watch it. Sorry if anyone considers that a spoiler, but yeah. The Book of Eli is a Holy Bible. I was quite impressed to see old Denzel swinging his machete, dagger or whatever the blade was, like a trained assassin. No matter how good I expect him to perform, he always does better. It was also nice to see Gary Oldman return to his roots as the villain after nearly a decade of playing Sirius Black in Harry Potter and Gordan in Batman. Mila Kunis is okay, but I'm not sure if she was exactly right for her role. She looked and sounded so clean and neat, while everyone else around her looked like they were actually in a post-apocalytic world. She wasn't bad though. Overall, The Book of Eli is pretty good.

Denzel plays the part of warrior/monk bearing the last surviving King James Bible across the parched corpse of a sun bleached America.  If Eli had been a Buddhist or Shaolin or Islamist nobody would have a problem with it.  However America has been programmed so thoroughly by a secular celebrity-worshipping media and a liberal progressive academia they have a knee jerk reaction of revulsion to even a whiff of Christian spirituality.

Just SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF for two hours and enjoy a beautifully shot movie with fantastic actors, excellent characters and quick brutal fight choreography by Jeff Imada.  What, it's okay to accept Matt Murdock and a barrel of radioactive muck but Eli's faith instantly ignites conspiracy theories?

Please.

Another great component of the film is its haunting soundtrack.  Electronic despair and desolation, like the wind keening over the arid bones of civilization; it fits this future world perfectly.

Gary Oldman is as rotten a bastard as Carnegie as he is heroic as Jim Gordon.  Denzel is serene but believably lethal as a black Qui Chang Kane and Mila Kunis is great as the determined but intimidated Solara.

Top notch acting, and an intriguing story.  It was the ending that really took me by surprise, so much so I ended up watching this a second time wondering how I didn't see it coming.

One of the best films I've seen in a long time.

""I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see.""

One premise of the film is interesting to ponder:  can faith be the cause of an apocalypse?  or is it the source of salvation?

""Both thorns and thistles shall bring forth, for us, for out of the ground we were taken for the dust that we are... and to the dust we shall return.""

Eli did fight the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith.  It's up to us to decide if that's a good thing, and if it matters.",1338768000,4,978,4.116402116402116

A couple of women following him around acting sympathetic towards his quest, but of course, in fear for their lives so he can occasionally protect them from harm.

The gritty, barren wasteland in the background. (yay for Fallout 3)

4101676,4,B003A8FET6,"Interesting that some people seem to be treating this movie like it is more than it is (or was meant to be). While I guess any discussion on religion can become controversial, I don't view this first and foremost as a movie that is supposed to lead to a lot of philosophical introspection, an assault against any faith, or a statement on religion itself. No one is trying to ram anything down anyone's throat, or disparage anyone's belief system.  It's just the background for the movie and its central character, and while there are surely some thematic elements here that can be discussed and debated (is that a bad thing for a movie?), really the only thing potentially offensive in the movie is the level of violence, which sadly seems to be standard fare. With that being said there are some real issues with the movie. Denzel seems to be becoming like Pacino and Deniro the more movies he does.  You kind of know what you are going to get. It works well enough here however in the end. One could also argue that all of the casting does seem just a little off, including Oldman, or maybe its just a result of direction they were given. Its probably the Oldman the Hughes brothers wanted.

I would disagree with those who say there is nothing original here. Its almost impossible to make a ""post apocalyptic"" movie without having to default to some cliches. Yes, those are present, but any movie these days that contains a couple things you didn't see coming is almost worth it on its own, and I can recall three such things in The Book of Eli, a couple of which were quite clever.

For people who think they would like this movie but are unsure after reading some of the more negative reviews, you can pretty much safely ignore them and dive in. Anyone who would rate this movie one star either fancies themselves a movie snob  or is someone who should have known they were not going to like it in the first place.",1333065600,,1919,4.487106017191977

4101684,5,B003A8FET6,"Before I start on the movie, here's a short list of people I know that's enjoyed this. Me (I'm a Christian, but I refuse to be religious, no matter what the status quo says), my brother (who's a nihilistic agnostic), a former boss of mine (who's borderline agnostic/atheist), and a couple friends of mine (anywhere from Christian to atheist to skeptic). None of them had anything bad to say, no matter how overt the Christian themes were. No matter how obvious the Christianity was. And they never felt preached at, nor felt this was religious propaganda at all. Why? I don't think it was only because there were a couple dozen f-bombs and other such swearing, heavy amounts of brutal violence (including decapitations and dismemberments), and references to taboo issues even churches would be extremely uncomfortable talking about, let alone dealing with.
Story wise, by this point in time, everyone knows what it's about, so I'll skip that and go into more technical details. Like something I noticed rarely comes up in other people's reviews- there's references to cannibalism (never explicit, but if you know human biology, you can notice it) and systematic manipulation of religion (something that dictators throughout history have tried using the Bible for, just to control the masses- just look at the Inquisition and the Catholic Church in the Medieval era).
Action wise, this movie does provide plenty of heavy action. From the (forementioned) decapitation and dismemberments to crazy gunplay and even a rocket or two thrown in for good (and eye-popping) measure. From the visual style, the people who worked on this (who also worked on Boyz in da Hood) did a real good job at the visual filter to make sure it didn't look like every other Hollywood film (meaning too realistic and next to no actual artistic value), and a couple visual allusions to specific art styles and known portraits, but mainly by the name of the style.
As for this ""religious propaganda"", I don't see any, and I am, in no way, religious. Just because someone protects a Bible, I suppose, means it's Churchey propaganda. Yet if he were carrying a Bhagavad Gita or the Sutta Pitaka (dealing with Hinduism and Buddhism respectively), no one would care. But atheists forbid that it should be the Bible (let alone the New King James version). Seems like a non-issue compared to the overall feel of the film.
I can say that, even as a huge fan of heavy action-oriented films and (actually good) Christian movies, I am proud to own this movie.
Still, to this day, my agnostic brother, who has no interest in religion, loves this movie.",1328572800,,2612,4.885135135135135

alright so nitty gritty, the fighting is beautiful, the choreography is perfect with every movement a seamless connection to the next. who ever was behind it was truly a pro.

the art style is perfect, sometimes an almost black and white while other times incredibility vivid.

the characters are great, denzel washington is both badass and hilarious at just the right times. the villain is perfect, it's the kind of guy you'd expect to take over in that kind of situation.

the ending...is brilliant, so much foreshadowing to different parts that all amount to a twist that doesn't feel forced or out of place but exactly as it should be.

The mission is not revealed until about halfway through the movie and the final twist is reserved for the last few minutes.

4101688,3,B003A8FET6,"Let's get this part out of the way.

This movie was made for a conservative, fundamentalist Christian audience - the kind that can watch an hour-and-a-half story about a religious zealot trekking through a horrific hellscape while nonironically killing for his peaceful, loving god. If this had been a movie about Islam and The Holy Qu'ran, American audiences on both ends of the political spectrum would have rioted. But since it is about someone killing and, in one awful instance, allowing rape in the name of the Christian faith, it is an acceptable movie.

The setting and action are done very well. I felt like I was in a post-apocalyptic landscape throughout the entire movie. I'm not usually an action fan, and even though the movie overused the ""one man against a gang of thugs"" shtick, it's not a big deal since that's not what the movie is about. Women are portrayed as second-class citizens and toys, and that portrayal works. I have no illusions that, in a post-WWIII world, racists and misogynists with guns would have a field day.

The plot is really loose and it's here that one can see just how this movie was created. It's a Frankenstein's monster created piecemeal to cater to a religious and action movie loving audience that doesn't really care about plot. In short, they're catering to people that pat themselves on the back when they can see through the most transparent veneer of symbolism. If this was supposed to be a fun movie, I would forget about that part. But it pretends to be a modern-day allegory, not a simple, fun romp through the wasteland.

So, if you can stand being preached at by a movie that was made by a bunch of producers with moneybags in their eyes for a target audience of religious guys that make their wives watch boring action flicks, then give this one a shot.",1327190400,,1812,4.670846394984326
4101689,5,B003A8FET6,"A man walks through desolate wilderness of a broken world. He suffers from thirst and hunger, wears rags and sleeps in ruins and other fortune hideouts. He must protect himself from the deadly blazing sun during the day and a not less deadly cold at night. He is lonely, as he crosses few people on the road - and amongst those he meets, most are thieves, bandits, madmen and cannibals. Although not yet old, he is not a young man anymore and his strength slowly abandons him. Scars and burns cover his skin, the stigmata of his personal Via Dolorosa. And he can not stop as he carries a heavy burden, and he would rather die than abandon it, as he must bring it to a safe place - which he didn't find yet. His name is Eli (Denzel Washington) and he has been walking like that for the last thirty years...

""The book of Eli"", as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, is basically a mixture of ""Mad Max 2"" and ""The Road"", but with one very special element which distinguishes it from all other post-apocalyptic movies I saw - a very powerful Christian message. Because the burden Eli carries is the last Bible that exists in this devastated world. And two perils threaten this treasure - that it is destroyed, or even worse, that it fells into wrong hands...

The wrong hands in this story belong to a certain Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a ruthless, cruel, but cunning and ambitious man, who rules tyrannically over the only ""town"" lost in the middle of desolation. His power is based mainly on the control of the only source of clean water in his vast domain. He used his power to gather a community in which people are protected from thirst, hunger and roaming cannibals - but where there is little freedom and where brutish thugs serving Carnegie are aristocracy, bulling the powerless plebeians. Carnegie wants to expand his domain and rise from a local boss to a king, but he is not certain if his little army can achieve that. He believes however, that if he owned a Bible and could preach its message to scattered remnants of humanity, he could become quite easily the supreme religious, political and military leader of a kingdom.

The unavoidable confrontation between Eli and Carnegie includes some action scenes, but it is essentially spiritual and contains some very simple but powerful lessons. At one moment Eli recites the famous psalm 23: "" The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death; I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."" And the whole movie is actually mostly an illustration of this prayer - a message of encouragement to the righteous.

But there is also a warning for the wicked - even if you lay your hands on the greatest treasures of the Earth, soon they will turn to dust which will slip between your fingers... And the thing that I liked particularly in this movie, is that director and scenario writer decided, that the Almighty sometimes simply can not resist to play a particularly naughty, even vicious joke at the expense of the villains...)))

Another great treasure of this movie is THE twist before the end, which changes completely the way we perceived EVERYTHING that happened before, a little like the revelation in the ""Sixth sense"" (but just to be precise, NO, it is not the same revelation!). This twist has its importance. I must humbly admit that in the beginning I was not thrilled by this film and I almost stopped watching it after 10 minutes - but I forced myself to continue and I was ultimately greatly rewarded. When the film was finished, I immediately rewatched it a second time, because once you know THE twist, the whole film is changed and it is really worthy to be seen again.

Although this is mostly a Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman show, I also liked to see Jennifer Beals and Malcolm McDowell in smaller but important supporting roles. On another hand, Mila Kunis, although quite present on the screen, is not allowed to play a lot, as her character is there mainly to give Eli an occasion to speak and let us know a little about him and his story. It is not very fair for her, but she plays this auxilliary role with grace.

Finally, I must admit that being a Christian I may not be entirely objective when reviewing this film and OK, maybe I liked it a little bit more than it desserves. But still, it made quite an impression on me and I can not give it anything less than five stars - and the final message of ""The book of Eli"", which is also the title of this review, taken from the New Testament, is splendid and a very powerful one.",1326672000,3,5014,4.491228070175438

4101693,3,B003A8FET6,"It's truly sad to see films at odds with their own marketing departments.  You've seen it before; last year's exceptional ""Adventureland"" was one of the more recent casualties.  And, if my theory proves correct, The Hughes Bros.' ""Eli"" could be 2010's first.

It's a tragedy, to say the least as, judged under the merits it abides by, Eli is a thought-provoking, imaginative, and collectively disciplined action drama that's only a little pretentious.  It's not the next post-apocalyptic, action oriented crowd pleaser, nor was it really meant to be from the start.  Sure, there are artificial injections of action sequences that are quite good (especially one during the latter half that mushrooms into a spiraling shootout that is truly exciting), but they only act to needlessly complicate things.

As a result, the movie itself suffers severely from a real identity crisis, not appealing enough to any particular audience aside from those who respect a theme with heart, a stellar cast, and a realized vision.  The sparse wastelands that the Hughes siblings have presented to us may not be my favorite post-fallout world, but it's hard to not call it one of the more authentic and genuine yet seen in cinema.

Denzel Washington, having produced the film alongside veteran Silver, is solid, as always, who's performance nearly makes us forget how forgettably cut-out and tight-lipped his role requires him to be.  Gambon and company are satisfactory, and Kunis is decent as a more unconventional sidekick, but the real star here is Gary Oldman, who  has a special gift for getting the absolute best out of his villainous roles.  It's an impeccable fit, and he's a real joy to watch.  Another particular performer who I greatly admire makes an appearance, but I'll leave that for those who can catch him when he makes his screen entrance.

I know I'm not the only one who had expected to walk into this theatre assuming that my brain wouldn't be doing much more than twiddling his thumbs while my visual senses would get an eye candy workout.  Truth be told, I cant help but feel gipped after coming to the realization that, yes, there was a story and a theme, and it really was worth paying attention to.  Ultimately, that's the fault of the marketing team and, to a lesser extent, screenwriter Gary Whitta, who's ambition couldn't quite translate onto paper.

That said, I can't blame anyone but myself for judging Eli's book by its seemingly flashy, hollow cover, only to find something actually meaningful within.",1324166400,,2519,4.961904761904762

4101707,3,B003A8FET6,"Well, there's not much new or thought provoking offered in 'The Book of Eli' that helps this film standout in the much overdone post-apocalyptic film genre. You know the scenario, the vast majority of mankind has been wiped-out almost overnight, now only small pockets of communities remain, each location having little to know knowledge as to where the others might be. Law and order have become a thing of the past, now control belongs in the hands of the strongest and of course the most evil of the survivors.

In this ""only the strong survive"" world comes the man in dark sunglasses, Denzel Washington who possesses a book more valuable than gold. When evil guy Gary Oldman learns of the book he sends his minions after it and the battle begins.

Again, nothing new here, a little 'Mad Max' and 'Waterworld' along with an added secret ala 'The Sixth Sense' that serves as an interesting twist at the end but not enough to make you want to watch the movie again and look for the clues you missed the first time through. However if you're a Denzel or Oldman fan it's worth at least one viewing.",1310342400,,1097,4.591836734693878
4101708,2,B003A8FET6,"The two stars are strictly for the good production and acting in the film.  The lack of three others stars is to signify how much I dislike the plot and its execution.

First, I should say that the movie seems to lend itself to a variety of interpretations, much like the Bible itself.  I don't know if this is intentional, but it's an odd feeling to watch a movie where the central idea seems to morph back and forth as the movie progresses.  I suppose it could be a mark of the writer's brilliance to juggle contradictory ideas so well, but personally I found it distracting and unpleasant. There were several ideas at play, and here are the ones most obvious:

- The United States was devestated by a religion-fueld catastrophe of some sort; therefore, religion is dangerous.

- Now that religious books are almost nonexistent, along with their attendant moralities, the United States is lawless and ammoral. There is no source of morality outside of these books.

- Religious books are only dangerous in the wrong hands; otherwise, they are filled with the spiritual necessities of healthy societies.

- People who would pervert the power of religious books are blind to the truths inside of them.

- Only men of strong faith are able to rise above their baser desires, possess true courage, and have a deeper meaning to their life beyond mere existence.

- Men of strong faith who listen to their voices are beyond reproach; they have no burden of evidence and their path is true for them because it reflects their inner guidance.

- The defense of religion can sometimes supercede its perceived tenants of love and compassion.

- The rebuilding of a civilized society can only begin with the widespread availability of the Bible.

I could probably think of a few other themes, but while watching The Book of Eli I had a hard time figuring out the main theme, but by the end of the movie, it seems clear to me that the movie was primarily promoting The Bible as the lone source of morality in the world, and that strong faith is necessary to sustain a person's happiness, virtue, and purpose.  Gardy Oldman's character, the one who sought to use the Bible as a weapon and a controller over the masses, is portrayed as completely villainous and obsessive.  It seems to indicate that people like him are not pruduced by some of the Bible's more unsavory messages (slavery is permissable, women are to be subservient to men, etc.), but arise indpendently and in spite of the Bible's preferred messages, such as the Hollywood-friendly variety that deal with love and peace.

The most troublesome aspect of the movie is that it idicates that the Bible's real meaning has nothing to do with all the wars and terrors that it has seemingly inspired in so many individuals and groups. It pretends that the Bible is a tome of love and peace, yet it ignores-- once again-- its condonement of slavery, its inferior treatment of women, its suggestions of severe child punishment, its Old Testament genocides commanded by God himself, its vacuous collection of commandments (not just the main ten) that mostly have nothing to do with real morality, and so on.

I could continue to ramble on for some length, but I will just summarize briefly my sentiments about the movie.  It is basically a boring, well-produced movie with brief spurts of bloody violence, whose message would most appeal to fundamentalist Christians who fancy their own R-rated Tim LeHaye-type story to prove to secular friends that they're not entirely ""uncool"", and that a Biblical world view is regaining significance even in the largely secular and liberal atmosphere of Hollywood.

And to top it off, after all this pandering to the fundamentalist, at the end of the movie there is a shot of The Bible being set right beside the Quran on a book shelf.  I wonder how many Christians who tote this movie as their new cinematic honor badge have noticed that neat little extreme liberal stroke right at the end.

p.s. since multiple interpretations of this movie are inevitable, I understand that some may not agree with my view of the movie's meaning.  But, as I said, I personally sensed most strongly the message dealt with above.",1310342400,5,4194,4.771784232365145

4101711,4,B003A8FET6,"Denzel Washington brings his A Game to every role, and THE BOOK OF ELI is no exception; in fact, this might be one of the actor's finest performances, as Washington plays Eli, a quiet, peace-loving man--yet peace rarely finds him--on a mission of destiny in a post-apocalyptic world.  By now everyone knows what The Book is, and that it is desperately coveted by those who would wield it to control the surviving population, including Carnegie (a brooding Gary Oldman), the kingpin of a town splashed in the midst of desolation.  Thus THE BOOK OF ELI becomes a story of pursuit, with Washington making his way west (followed by young Solara, played by Mila Kunis), with Carnegie's henchmen on his trail.

The story is told simply, the settings are compelling and believable, and Washington performs with a grace and dignity that is stunning.  Interspersed throughout the film are several memorable roles, including Jennifer Beals (playing Solara's blind mother), Ray Stevenson (as Redridge, Carnegie's lieutenant), Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour (a cannibalistic couple armed to the max), and Malcolm McDowell (a scholar at the end of Eli's quest).  My only problem with THE BOOK OF ELI centers around the violent confrontations; suspension of disbelief becomes exceedingly difficult when Eli constantly battles hordes of thugs, mows them down like grass, and walks away unscathed.  Annoying to be sure, but not annoying enough to take enjoyment away from a commanding performance and a very moving film.

Even so, I had to see it since I really like Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman (and Mila Kunis isn't exactly hard on the eyes). Wow, it took a few minutes before it sunk in and I really loved this movie. The almost sepia-toned picture and ambient soundtrack might seem ""bland"" but it really works well. I also like that the movie doesn't hit you over the head with what's going on. It's subtle and despite the partial spoiler about the book (hey, the product description has it so I went with it) there's still another surprise which adds to the discovery.

And, despite knowing what happens, my subsequent runs through (yes, I liked it that much) were still just as enjoyable. Great actors, beautiful scenes (despite it being desolate), beautiful ambient soundtrack, and a great story really make this movie worth adding to my collection.

4101721,4,B003A8FET6,"Don't let the first 30 minutes or so of 'The Book of Eli' fool you - it comes off as a bleak and moody mix of other post-apocalyptic stories like 'Mad Max' and 'The Road,' but by the time the credits roll you'll see the heart that beats beneath this cracked skin.

There's a lot of story to uncover in 'The Book of Eli,' more than I initially expected, and the themes and ideas expressed here surprised me. In a very good way.

Denzel Washington pulls off a subtle and understated performance as the lonely survivor of a cataclysmic event, as he moves with steady determination across dry desert landscapes - west, west, always west - protecting a book that he won't let anyone see. The other actors in the film are no slouches either, from Gary Oldman capturing the wonderfully twisted man in charge (recalling his bent cop from 'The Professional' for me) to Mila Kunis in a sidekick role that has impressive depth to Michael Gambon as a paranoid old man armed to the teeth and more.

The tone of the cinematography matches that of Denzel's character, harsh and raw and blasted into wide-open silences. The music carries us along in this vein as well, menacing and stark.

The action sequences are shot elegantly, almost like a dance - though often a dance where limbs fly and the dance only ends when the bodies stop twitching. These scenes do, however, stretch credibility to the absolute breaking point, as Denzel faces off against multiple enemies repeatedly and rarely gets a scratch. There is a possible reason for this explained about halfway into the film, but it comes too late and explains too little. This is probably the only weakness in a story that is otherwise impressive and unexpected.

The final scenes are simply a marvel of storytelling, and almost perfectly executed.

The wonderful thing about 'The Book of Eli' is the discovery of it. It methodically blasts away at every glimmer of hope...it does not flinch or look away. But then there is one who holds on. One who walks west, one who protects a single book with his life, one who will not give up, even when everyone around him already has.

For a film to express the ideas of hope and faith while avoiding trite, saccharine sentiments completely isn't just impressive - it's practically a revelation.",1306454400,4,2278,4.694235588972431

4101723,1,B003A8FET6,"I'll keep this short since there are many other reviews that have spent time detailing all the mistakes in this film.

Basically, it's a complete and utter waste of an interesting idea (an albeit simplistic one, but still). The fault goes squarely to two parties. The Directors and the Writer. The script is so simplistic that it actually has almost no plot. Yes, I realize, the bad guy wants the book. But ultimately, when the film is said and done, there's little there to remember back to. It felt like a video game. Character goes to area A, meets bad guys. Fights them, then heads to area B, but runs into more bad guys. etc and repeated. You could guess most everything that would happen. Very anti-climatic.

The filming, as well, was abysmal. The directors are, to be frank, terrible.

The worst example comes in two parts. The first being that they seem to be in love with slow motion shots, and the second being that they purposefully made it so that Eli's character never showed hardly any emotion.

The slow motion scenes, however, were the worst. Some of the best examples of amateur filmmaking I'd say. I would never watch a movie by them ever again.

On the acting side of things, Denzel was... well... doing what the bad directors told him to do, which ended up bad. There's nothing special about his performance. As for the girl however, she was excellent and really surprised me. She has a bright future ahead (no pun intended).

Anyway, please do yourself a favor and pass on seeing this film. I realize that the plot and idea sounds interesting. That's because the idea IS interesting. However, the film itself, is not.

There are only a couple moments in the film you can grasp at, but even these are like a torn rope when clung to.

Non-Christians will feel like this film is hollywood-Christian propaganda, and Christian's will come away feeling the same, and also feeling upset that such a potential hit of a movie was wasted.

The twist at the end, which I won't give away like some other disgruntled reviewers, wasn't all that exciting. Not because it wasn't clever, but because the directors were so bad they didn't know how to lead up to it or execute it, much like the entire film.

It really is a shame.

This film does not deserve a sequel in the least.

The pacing and storytelling is very similar to Shyamalan films.  I was very tempted to be bored in the beginning of the film but quickly found the pacing and scenes of alleged insignificance were actually doing quite well at building a very dramatic plotline.

It doesn't hurt that the cast is stellar and they all work together very well.

The Blu-Ray quality is superb.  I have watched on a 24, 47, and 40 inch LCD and every pixel is simply a masterpiece.

This movie won't be for everyone.  Its a slow moving story that is finally fulfilled only in the very end, but once you arrive there it is well worth the journey.

The violence and some content is a little rough for younger viewers as the story is about a corrupt and devastated society that is literally fighting in a survival of the fittest scenario.  Throw in a few people that will do anything to make a play for power and you get some disturbing images that may turn a few stomachs.

4101730,1,B003A8FET6,"For starters, this film has an excessive amount of product placement in it.  Yes, you read that right.  They use brand name objects for advertisement in a film about the apocalypse.  From Ipod to Dr. Dre Beats headphones, there's plenty of shots of how long lasting these items last in the event of human downfall.

This brings me to my next point.  What causes this apocalyptic period is completely ignored and is only hinted at throughout the film.  They ignore the setting and causes yet the setting itself is trite and unoriginal.  However, they do hint at what causes this era, but this leads to by far the greatest flaw of this garbage film.

The film has such an obvious religious message of Christianity and that by turning away from God and the Bible our society may fall apart in such a fashion as presented in the film.  Spoiler alert: Eli is looking for someone to deliver the Bible to preserve it and feels it can help reestablish society.  Did I need a spoiler alert for that though?  It's so obvious he's referring to the Bible.  Anyway, Eli is meant to be some righteous, god-fearing man, yet he completely contradicts the teachings of his precious Bible.  In the opening scene, he allows a woman to be gang raped because his secrecy and mission is a greater good.  There's no way in hell that Jesus would do something like this nor advocate his actions.  Jesus' ethics were not utilitarian.  Eli's actions are.  The film and the Hughes brothers think they're being subtle and coy with this religious message but it's beyond obvious and feels like they're trying to beat you over the head with their message.  Even then, it seems like they don't know their religion well enough.  They take a more Old Testament route with Eli's character, as well ignore that ethics themselves don't come from God, they misplace and overestimate the value of the Bible to society.  The film just comes off as nearly having an evangelical Christian taint I felt.

Denzel's performance is one of the worst in his career as well.  He's a great actor, but maybe it was due to the Hughes brothers' direction (more likely).  It's completely one-note, dull, and plain unlikable.

The final major flaw (nearly tied for the worst attribute of the film) is its ending.  They give us another horrible twist that rivals M. Night Shymalan for how bad it is.  It turns out all along Eli is blind!  Oooh!  >_>  As if the film couldn't get any worse, they made Eli blind simply to shock us into wondering how he could've done all the cool (ie crappy) action moves and how he memorized/interpreted the Bible (I think he had a copy in braile) for nothing more than a plot device that seemed only to please fans of The Village or Unbreakable.

The ONE positive of this film is Gary Oldman.  The guy is a chameleon and always knows how to make a character come alive.  He makes you really hate and somehow love his character because he's brilliantly devious.  This is due in part to the Hughes brothers too as much as I hate to say it.  They made a character who knows what the Bible can do to people and how it can be used to control the masses.  This was the best thing the film had going for it.

I didn't even scratch the surface though on other poor aspects like the action sequences, its Waterworld-like set and costume design (who seriously rips off Waterworld for anything??), the terrible character Milas Kunis has (who takes Eli's reigns after Eli dies at the end for no important reason other than to make simple people feel sad), and its unfitting soundtrack.

4101731,4,B003A8FET6,"I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. There was something evil about this movie, tho. Maybe that everyone is 'out for themselves'. I was able to think of another movie it reminded me of (that used an evil movie to sell a moral tale or a religious theme - perhaps they all do) but can't remember it's title. I don't think it's completely true, but another reviewer called The Book of Eli 'without humanity'. All I can think to say is that even the bible concedes the Earth as the devil's playground.

There's the question of whether this happens to include religion in a good story, or whether the film makers are using the story to sell religion. Or using either or both only to make money. Perhaps it doesn't matter. I liked the movie. I would make a guess they're trying to sell religion.

The most interesting thing in the film (and perhaps what it's centered on) is the notion that the bible can be used to control or pacify the masses. If you can't believe this, perhaps you won't like the movie? Perhaps it works because it's a negative (tho powerful) view of the bible, the way it's presented here in the movie. Regardless, it worked for me. I'm good at suspending my disbelief. When I think about it seriously, though, it wouldn't work. In some kind of post-apocalyptic world - maybe. In today's world, forget it. You'd need something that speaks to people today, written in the manner people talk nowadays. That's what you need.

4101732,5,B003A8FET6,"Even though I'm an agnostic, I've grown weary of standard Hollywood junk in which religion is portrayed as near evil and religious people as fools.  'The Book of Eli' and a film I just reviewed, 'Frailty', are major exceptions to this general rule.  Eli, although not the returned Messiah, is his prophet in the desert of a ravaged earth.

The earth has been savaged by an apolcalyptic war and ignorance rules the land.  He who has pre-apocalyptic knowledge has the potential for great and destructive power and there are those who will kill to learn its secrets.

I am a Bible believing Christian who believes in the second coming of our Lord Jesus, and a great tribulation after the rapture of his Church, but I cannot recommend the film.  A good ending is no excuse for all the F-bombs and the expletive GD in a movie that appeals to Christian audiences. It is very violent and full of offensive language. There is also much violence against women including rapes and beatings.  I do know that these will be common in the end times, but we have a good imagination and expect these things to be left out of a film that is supposed to appeal to us.

Denzel Washington is in top form here in this smart action film with a lot of heart and soul.

I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that I didn't see the end twist coming which is a rarity for me, especially considering the clues that are dropped throughout the film. Of course, it's easy to see once you've seen it. The film has a slick look with a very narrow color scheme giving it an almost sepia tone or black and white look at times. This is a good thing because it makes you focus on the story and not a lot of parlor tricks.

I can not recommend this film enough for action fans who want a little more than explosions and senseless violence. The only reason I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the story wasn't all that original despite having some nice twists.",1301184000,2,1030,4.223350253807107

People struggle to survive, cannibalism becomes common and there is no longer a United States of America.  In its place, small communities basically go back to being city states, and the roads are full of rogues & thieves.

Denzel Washington plays a self-sufficient man who is able to take care of himself in spite of all the chaos that the world has descended into.  Books have been burned & most of the inhabitants of the planet are illiterate.

This is  a well done movie, and you're always going to get top-notch performances from Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and Malcom Macdowell.  There is one problem w/this film, however, and that's the simple fact that it's not a very good movie.  Frankly, I found it to be a yawner.  I kept hoping that the denouement would be profound & make up for everything leading up to it, but it just wasn't to be.  I felt like the ending of the movie was like waiting in line for 3 hours to see Mick Jagger only to be stuck with a Roseanne Barr concert instead.

There is one demographic who will likely enjoy this film, and that would be far right-wing religious types.  The religious overtones basically take Old Testament topics & place them into the future.  If you're into that sort of thing, then you might like this film.

4101738,5,B003A8FET6,"The BOOK OF ELI

THE BOOK OF ELI ADDRESSES SEVERAL ISSUES FOR TODAY.

In the Movie, the earth was scorched by the sun and the survivors burned all the Bibles. Why? They viewed the ""natural catastrophe"" as an act of God and in defiance and rebellion, burned His Word. The most allegorical statement of all by Gary Whitta, Eli was blind, but lived as though he could see ! In the Movie, Carnegie, Gary Oldman's character wants the Bible for power to control the world that he lives in. Carnegie represents the wolves in sheep's clothing that use the Bible for power, greed, and selfish ambition.

In the beginning of the Movie, Eli is attacked by a group of cannibals. Eli warns their leader, that if he puts his hand on him again, he will lose his hand, and of course the guy disregards the warning and loses his hand. After dismantling his attackers, Eli leans down to the leader, who now has one hand, and embraces him. He hugs him, as if to say I love you, and then kills him. To me, this is an allegorical way to say, love your enemies. It is possible to defend your nation and family and still love your enemies, you don't have to hate them. Eli was a chosen vessel of God that laid down his life, finished his course, was transformed, and received white robes in the end. Eli says grace over his meal and Solara gets Transformed and leaves her people to follow Eli. Towards the end of the Movie, Solara, goes back to her people. As Christians, when God sets us free to serve Him, the first thing that most of us do, is to go back to our friends and families to carry the Good News of the Gospel to them. Also in the original book the author did not include any other religions on the book shelf, the Bible stood alone. I imagine that Sodom and Gomorrah looked a little scorched after Gods' judgement of fire and brimstone<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Eli/dp/B002ZG997C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Eli</a>.",1300924800,,1973,4.663793103448276
4101739,3,B003A8FET6,"I was curious to see how a post-apocalyptic yarn on preserving the Bible might unfold. The title ""The Book of Eli"" is a neat pun: Eli also means God. (see Matthew 27:46). Is Eli miraculously equipped to do what God has promised? (see Matthew 5:18).

As TEOTWAWKI films go, it's well made and has a great look and feel. And with its impossible time frames, sequencing and martial feats, it's entertainingly fantastic. But as a preservation quest, it fails. The film labors over words and ritual and idols (talismen), but nowhere is the Lord of the Bible revealed (Jesus Christ -- ""Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."" (Acts 4:12)).

4101740,4,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli is an entertaining action film.  It's about a man who has invincible (or rather, nearly invincible) super powers as a result of a book he carries around with him everywhere he goes.

He also contains super human strengths apparently, whether because of the book or just because the movie writers needed to make something exciting happen in order to entertain the viewers- I don't necessarily know which one it is.

Anyway, he travels across deserted lands telling everyone he meets that he's travelling west, until he ends up coming across a group of power hungry smalltown thugs who would like nothing more than to take the book away from him once they discover he's carrying it.

The entire storyline consists of the man trying his very best to protect the book and keep it away from those who don't know how to handle its power.

I really like the gloomy setting that takes place throughout the movie.  It's always exceptionally bleak and succeeds in delivering the scenery of a post-apocalyptic world perfectly.  The grey clouds, the eerie silence, the emptiness... just a frighteningly realistic scenario.

The acting is pretty good for the most part, however my only complaint is that the storyline wasn't strong enough to keep me attached.  There's only so much you can talk about when the storyline pertains to protecting a book with special abilities.

However some of the shooting and fighting segments were really good, my favorite being the shoot-out at the one house resulting in a portion of the house literally being blown apart.  I loved this part.

4101742,3,B003A8FET6,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

For those who were unable to suspend their disbelief (or more importantly, their common sense) regarding the many implausible moments in 'The Book of Eli', let me say unequivocally that I am with you! However, let me explain why I gave this film a '3' out of '5' (or 5 out of 10 on Imdb) despite finding the whole thing quite hokey. First of all, there are many films that are far worse than this one; secondly, I thought that the cgi effects and set design were actually quite good, especially the way in which the filmmakers created their 'equivalent' wild west post-apocalyptic town; and finally, the film actually has engendered a great deal of internet postings defending the many absurd, implausible ideas and scenes utilizing all kinds of tortured reasoning, which I found quite enjoyable to read!

The Hughes Brothers have come a long way since their urban crime drama, Menace II Society. They have proved they can proffer up a post-apocalyptic shoot-em-up as good as any mainstream director. Taking a cue from M. Night Shyamalyn's 'Sixth Sense', not only do they know how to dispatch (i.e. 'off') the bad guys in a multitude of creative ways (hands chopped off, cross-bow shootings, one gunshot take downs, etc.), they also can throw in all kinds of clues, pointing to the fact (SPOILERS AHEAD--DON'T READ IF YOU WANT THE TWIST ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU) that Denzel Washington (Eli) has been blind all along. How exactly is Eli able to kill all those biker dudes (first with a knife and later with a gun) without being able to see them? The answer, of course, is in the 'book' itself. Wouldn't you know it, but the Book of Eli begins with a 'B'; yep, shock of all shocks, it's THE BIBLE!!! Channeling 'Ben Hur', the Hughes Brothers make the argument that miracles can be found even in a post-apocalyptic world! Like the Apostle Paul, Eli's 'faith' allows him to miraculously survive multiple onslaughts, including a bullet direct to the gut by bad guy Carnegie.

The warmed-over Christian shibboleth that miracles occur due to 'belief in faith alone' is just another canard where we must suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy this film. But there's one small problem. Eli has been carrying one copy of the Bible that he's been trying to memorize for years, and it's in Braille!!! Since the Bible in Braille would consist of many heavy volumes, this is one plot point which even some of the most fanatical defenders of the film, have trouble explaining away.

There are other moments in 'Eli' which I still had a lot of trouble explaining away myself. What about Eli walking around for days after having stocked up with only a canteen of water? All the copies of the Christian Bible have been burned but copies of the Jewish Bible and Koran end up on the library shelf at Alcatraz? And how exactly did he escape from the room when Carnegie and his thugs lock him up? I guess Eli finds a 'way' because all those who believe in God, manage to do so.

Perhaps one of the most weakest ideas in 'Eli' is Carnegie's belief that obtaining the Bible will enable him to extend his power. Since he and Eli are only a few of the people who actually have heard of The Bible, why does he assume that introducing it to the post-apocalyptic survivors will enable him to bring them under his fold? Since the majority of people in the new world have little or no knowledge of prior literature, Carnegie could have wrote his own book which he could have used to sway the masses. Of course, somehow the Bible is supposed to have some kind of a mystical, intrinsic power (perhaps rays emanating from the book itself) which leads Carnegie to believe he can use it as a brainwashing tool. Since it's never demonstrated how Carnegie could become more powerful by getting hold of The Bible, the stakes are never high enough for us to care whether Carnegie gets the book or not. Now if Eli knew the location of a nuclear bomb, that's a Macguffin that I could believe Carnegie would want to get his hands on!

There seems little doubt that the most completely miscast actor in 'The Book of Eli' is Mila Kunis. She seems so out of place in this film that her performance actually drags the film down a notch or two. USA Today film critic Claudia Puig couldn't have said it better about Kunis in her film review: ""Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial."" Didn't anyone find it a bit ridiculous how Solara (Kunis) suddenly acquires Eli's amazing martial arts-like skills and takes down most of Carnegie's henchmen in one of the final scenes? Denzel also has become painfully one-note in many of his recent film roles as a middle-aged actor.

Finally, I'd like to chime in on the controversy as to whether Eli has converted to Islam when he arrives on 'Alcatraz Island'. A Muslim is not allowed to read any religious book except the Koran, so when Eli dresses up in a white robe as he translates the Bible, I think the Hughes Brothers were suggesting that all along he was some kind of post-apocalyptic Essene. Just my interpretation!

I would like to thank all the faith-based defenders of 'The Book of Eli' along with all those who employ tortured reasoning to explain all the ridiculous goings-on in this film.

You do need a good suspension of disbelief some for this however(hence the 4 stars).  The fight scenes are over the top from the first swing and it would be generous to say that some of the background information on the war was a ""stretch"".

4101749,4,B003A8FET6,"One of the most stunning stylistic movies I've seen in years is The Book of Eli (2010), Denzel Washington's recent post-apocalyptic genre addition. Directors (and brothers) Albert and Allen Hughes have created one of the better films in this popular Hollywood genre, and clearly left their mark as talented filmmakers all over it. The loosely defined apocalypse genre is hard to categorize. It's usually a bit sci-fi, drama, thriller, and action. You've got films like The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Twelve Monkeys (1995) that are mostly set in the time BEFORE the apocalyptic event they are about takes place. These films are about the attempt to prevent the apocalypse from happening. Then you've got the films that are basically set DURING the apocalyptic event, like Deep Impact (1998), Armageddon (1998), and The Seventh Sign (1988), where everyone's efforts to prevent the disaster ultimately fail. And finally you have films set AFTER the apocalyptic event where it's all about the survival in this new reality, like Waterworld (1995), The Postman (1997), The Matrix (1999), Planet of the Apes (1968), and The Road (2009). The Book of Eli fits into the latter category of movies after the apocalypse, where people are forced to deal with a new, usually dark and twisted, world.

Set in what is assumed to be the desert Southwest of the United States, The Book of Eli is a pretty simple story about a man named Eli whose sole purpose in life is to guard one of the last books left in the world and take it on its journey to its final destination, revealed through the course of the movie. After the apocalypse, there was a manic fever of book burning and destruction that basically rid the world of books and literacy, all in an attempt to control the remaining people who survived whatever happened to cause this apocalypse. The film doesn't go in to the cause of this new post-apocalyptic world, but instead focuses on how society keeps its shared historical knowledge alive in the context of complete brutal survival.

I recently saw The Book of Eli for the first time in HD on HBO. What a stellar presentation I must say! I'm wishing now that I had seen the film in the theater on the big screen. The Book of Eli is absolutely fantastic looking! The cinematography, production design, costumes, and make-up are really well designed and executed. My friend Siobhan Roome was a part of the Art Department for the film as a set designer, and she did her job very well...along with the rest of the art department team. Production Designer Gae S. Buckley and The Hughes Brothers gave this film a look and feel like no other and executed their vision with incredible craftsmanship.

Director of Photography Don Burgess really showed off his talents with the cinematography as well. There were a few shots that simply blew my mind with their composition and camera movement. There's one shot in particular that made me pause and rewind because I just hadn't seen it before. It's a 90-degree rotated pan with the horizon running vertically within the widescreen presentation. I wish I had a shot of it to share, but its better to see it the context of the film anyways. The gritty gray, black, yellow, and brown tones of the film perfectly reflect the barren desert topography and apocalyptic atmosphere that the story is telling. Burgess and The Hughes Brothers really gave The Book of Eli visuals that I'll never forget and compare every future movie within this genre against.

The original music for The Book of Eli by music composer Atticus Ross is really well-suited to the story and an excellent listen all on its own. I've listened to the soundtrack on its own several times since watching the movie. My favorite track is ""Panoramic"" and it's ""Eaten By Earth"" remix. Along with his work on The Social Network (2010), Ross had an incredible year in 2010. Now that I know that Ross was behind the music from the short-lived USA Network TV show Touching Evil (2004), which I thought was an awesome show unfairly cancelled, I'm even more enamored with him. I clearly remember the feeling of the haunting music from that show. And apparently Ross got his start in the business with that series. Ross has a very modern style in his sound that feels fresh and exciting. I'm really looking forward to his future work on David Fincher's upcoming remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo (2011). He's been re-paired with Trent Reznor from The Social Network soundtrack, so the sound should be interesting to say the least.

The plot and story of The Book of Eli was good. Like I said, it's a simple story, but well-executed by actors Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis and the rest of the supporting cast. Nobody's acting really stood out as superior within their careers, but they were all solid performances that served the story of the film. Oldman felt a bit like he was re-hashing his bad guy role from Air Force One (1997), but he is good playing a bad guy, especially with his heavily textured face. There were a few times during the film that I felt the pacing and plot weren't going anywhere and were just filling time. I think the film could've benefitted from a little more complexity in its plot and more focus on developing the emotional depth of the characters and how they got to where they are personally. Maybe more back story about their lives was needed. That being said, I still felt like there was enough depth to this story that it satisfied me. And combined with the amazing look and style of everything, I'm very much compelled to watch the film again on Blu-ray.

I'm not going to give away the story, but I like the twist ending. I did not see it coming (no pun intended for those that have seen the film). But it worked for me even though I knew going in to the film what book Eli is protecting. I give The Book of Eli 3.5 stars out of 5. It's a very good movie that surprised me and gave me a very satisfying experience. One of the better films of 2010. The Hughes Brothers are talented directors that have their own unique vision as filmmakers and its pleasing to see them express it through their films. I'll definitely be curious to see what they do next.",1297728000,2,6225,4.6855575868372945

The plot is almost non-existent, but there is one twist at the end (and it's pretty good, though entirely unbelievable, so I won't spoil it). As to the ""mysterious"" book Eli carries, its identity is obvious from the start, along with the right-wing religious bias of the movie, and, presumably, its makers. The ADD generation'll go for it, though - a lot of things blow up, crash, or get shot to pieces - nothing original. All who oppose the righteousness of the central character are evil, and must die.

Two great actors--Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman--are utterly wasted on this near-plotless and eminently pointless mess.

Recycling every stale post-apocalypse cliche, the movie adds nothing to the genre, and is DULL.

The pacing is glacial. Scene after scene is of people walking, alone, and pausing. Camera-zoom: voila, nothing happens.

The scenery is unbelievable; apparently they spent all their money on actors and had none left for special effects. The CGI is bargain-basement and looks like the painted backdrop in a high school play.

The lighting is sepia. This isn't really a color movie. This is a brown-and-white movie. Yes, I know the post-apocalypse world is supposed to be bleached and irradiated and scorched (this is why everyone has to wear sunglasses), but the brown tone just makes everything seem out of focus.

Denzel Washington underacts. He is stoical to the point of somnolent. Even when he fights (which is a lot), he seems to be just going through the motions. By the way, in the many-on-one fight scenes (which are many), each bad guy carefully waits his turn to be stabbed or gored or pierced or otherwise impaled; none of them has the brilliant idea of ganging up.

Gary Oldman overacts. This is painful to watch. He chews more scenery than Al Pacino at his worst.

But nothing helps.

4101754,2,B003A8FET6,"I hesitated watching this film for dread that it would be some pseudo-religious mind screw, and was right. It's only redeeming qualities are Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and a few blood and gore action scenes. The setting of the film is in the near future. Because of the division that religion creates, holy books (more specifically the Bible) have been gathered up and destroyed to prevent war, but alas, it is too little, too late. The world has become a post-apocalyptic nightmare, devastated by nuclear war. The earth is scorched, the atmosphere desiccated, and the planet is a now a barren desert. Small groups of humans struggle to survive among the ruins of the cataclysm. However, there seems to be hope. Among the survivors is a King James Bible and apparently only one black man, Eli. In what seems to be a weird paradoxical effort, Eli is trying to save the very book that has caused the destruction of the world and almost the extinction of mankind.

The film does a decent job of revealing why holy books were written and used in the first place. Ancient peoples were in constant danger of being invaded or subjugated by other tribes and armies. They lived in continual fear of being annihilated and their culture destroyed and forgotten. There was always a threat, always an impending apocalypse which would drive men to fear and to reject others and commit horrible acts, much like you see in the film. We see the residual of this ingrained fear in those that embrace and believe ancient text today. Carnegie (Gary Oldman) seems to understand this and wants this power to create nationalism and loyalty for his purposes.

Mankind has evolved to the point that they give imagination to their fears. It is man's ingrained fear of death and therefore his urge to conquer it that drives them. Men proselytize not to save others but to save themselves. Their fear of ""different"" drive men to convert everyone to their own beliefs and culture, then they believe they will finally be safe.

Quoting only ""nice"" verses of the Bible throughout the film, Eli reveals himself to be some self-proclaimed ""book savior"". I would have loved to have seen the faces of the people around Eli when he quoted these verses:
""But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own d_ng, and drink their own p_ss with you?"" (Isaiah 36:12; 2 Kings 18:27)

""For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh (gen_tals) is as the flesh (genit_ls) of asses (donkeys), and whose issue (s_men) is like the issue (sem_n) of horses."" (Ezekiel 23:20)

You should read the above verses in a modern translation to get the full disgusting impact of them. Moralists have censored and banned books for far less than these verses. For example, ""Catcher in the Rye"" was banned for containing the word ""wh_re"". The Bible (KJV) uses this word 15 times and the word ""harl_t"" 90 times. The Bible is filled with violence, murder, gore-filled bloodshed, suicide, pornography, misogyny, body mutilation, incest, pedophilia, genocide, racism, rape (including being raped to death by the men of a city), cannibalism (including boiling and eating their own baby), and many other terrible acts that I would not be allowed to write here. Many of these acts are portrayed in a positive and accepted manner of behavior. Yet, many people will give their children this book without the thought of what it contains. If theses stories were written in another book, these same people would condemn it.

""And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but COULD NOT drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."" - (Judges 1:19) ""...all things are possible with God."" - (Mark 10:27) Have you ever noticed how absurd, contradictory and illogical religious text can be. Yet, many people rarely, if ever, notice these contradictions, nor want to.
The film embraces this sense of contradiction and leaves you with a feeling of ""here we go again"". You are left to make up your own mind. Is Eli a Savior or the Angel of Death?",1296086400,3,4158,4.768055555555556

4101759,1,B003A8FET6,"Here's the premise...

In a post apocolyptic world, Denzel Washington is this mysterious apostle/keeper of the faith who roams around the country heading ""west"". When confronted, he's practically a superhero who can take on anybody and any amount of attackers. He's carrying around a Bible which is supposed to represent ""hope"" in this lawless, wasteland of a world. Gary Oldman, on the othe hand, is a power hungry villain who recognizes that the Bible would be an excellent tool in suppressing others, creating fear and justifying existing turmoil. He wants Denzel's Bible.

There's two ways to evaluate this loathsome movie.

1) As pure entertainment, it's terrible. The movie is, for the most part boring, the combat sequences are overstylish and the plot has no resolution, as though they did not where to go with this. The charactors, dialogue, and themes are preposterous.

2) In taking this as a serious metaphor for religion, it's even worse. While I'm not a big fan of organized religion, it can be argued that if this movie was supposed to be a proponent of organized religion, it seriously backfires. This movie paints the use of the Bible in mostly evil terms. Gary Oldman practically spews the Marxian view that ""religion is the opium of the masses"" in explaining why the Bible would be so powerful in his hands. Even the Denzel Washington charactor, who is supposed to be righteous with his  intentions for his Bible, really does not act as that much of a hero within the film.

There's brutality and violence that does not justify a purpose, charactor development on people that end up not being worthy of the development and a ridiculous conclusion.

This movie came out around the same time as ""The Road"", another overly dark, post apocolyptic film. That film, if the ""end of the world cinema"" is your thing, is far superior since it's more bleak, in a realistic manner and, in a horrifying portayal, examines the mass chaos when a society is broken down (although it a well made film, it puzzles me who would get an entertainment value out of such a really sad and depressing film).

If this movie did not have the charismatic Denzel Washington in it, it would not even be worth watching on cable.

I would think that the only person that could enjoy this would be either an ardent aethiest or religous zealot.",1295136000,22,2329,4.8025
4101760,4,B003A8FET6,"I do not like long reviews.  If I wanted to read a book, I would go buy a book!
With that said, 'The book of Eli' was a good movie, nothing more.
I always enjoy watching Denzel and don't believe he has done enough work over the
years.  He was believable (as was Gary Oldman who I was first introduced to from watching 'The Professional' as a drug crazed cop) in this movie, but I am afraid poor Mila Kunis has sadly been type cast (as has Ashton Kutcher) by the many years of being the stuck up, money grubbing, ditz on the long running 'That 70's show' on TV and was even less believable in 'Max Payne'.  Don't get me wrong, I like Mila, but her style does not change and it seems as though she cannot get into the part.

4101763,4,B003A8FET6,"I watched this movie on cable after watching the movie I bought on Amazon called ""Agora"". Talk about two movies that go together. Agora had Christians burning books and starting the Dark Ages. This movie went the other way, with one champion, whose body is burned and scarred after an apocalypse, seems like he may be protected on High, or is he? Watch Agora first, you'll appreciate this film more.

I had heard this movie was religious fodder for the evangelical set. I was glad and even shocked to see this wasn't the case. Actually, the villian played beautifully by Gary Oldman, was the Evangelical Power Player. I feel the movie makes clear, that his power is largely derived from literacy, which the townsfolk don't have, but he does. (Reminds me of a line from the once banned Gospel of Phillip) ""Ignorance is the mother of all evil"".

Eli, played by Denzil Washington provides action and beyond pragmatic sensiblility. This film leaves me guessing about Eli seeming supernatural nature. Whats more, Eli, is the proverbial, pray in a closet guy. His lack of religious bombast was refreshing.

At the end, we know what he is about. We also learn that no book, no matter our bias and prejudice, whether its the Bible, the Koran or the pages of Hustler should be burned or banned, and we must protect our literary heritage because it tells our posterity who we were, and what we were thinking and feeling at the time.

The Post-Apocalyptic genre isn't my thing, so I deduct a point for that. Its 3.5 to 4 at most. I probably would have given it 2 stars if I hadn't seen the other film first.",1294876800,2,1596,4.609154929577465

4101765,4,B003A8FET6,"`The Book Of Eli' explores one idea of what life could be like in a post nuclear war world. Here food, water, energy and books are hard to come by and every day is a struggle to survive. Eli (played by Washington) is known as a walker, who travels across the country (rather than living in a community) trying to subsist on meagre provisions and fighting off lawless robbers just to get by. He only goes into the communities (one of which that is run by the iron handed Gary Oldman) when he needs to recharge batteries or get extra water. He protects a sacred book which is highly sought after by other unscrupulous people and constantly moves west so that he can share his treasure with someone who may know how to do more good with it.

This film had a bleak feel to it at first, with muted colours and lots of ash, but it soon began to feel like a cross between a Mad Max film, an action film (due to Washington's `kick ass' character who is more than capable of looking after himself against some rather unsavoury specimens) and a religious allegory about mans folly's and humanity. This was reminiscent of `The Road' which I saw recently and which is based along similar themes, but I found this films story to be more engaging and more uplifting at the end and much prefer it over the aforementioned film. The acting is pretty decent from all involved and Oldman plays his sneering bad guy role perfectly yet again. There is a good twist in the tale and some issues are raised about mans behaviour without moralising or preaching. Some people seem to dislike this film due to it's religious overtones, but to be honest these are pretty slight and are relevant to the story. All in all this was an enjoyable film and if `The Road' put you off post apocalyptic films, but the premise still intrigues you, then this is well worth a viewing.

4101766,4,B003A8FET6,"First Impressions:

Initially, you may be tempted to group the movie: The Road with this movie. In the Road, they are heading south, just to get warm, while in this movie, Eli (Denzil Washington) is heading West, to deliver his book. While both are post-apocalyptic films, The Book of Eli is much more well defined, and the objective is clear and attainable. Also, the feeling of despair is not heavily relied upon in the Book of Eli.

Overview:

30 years ago, just after the last big war, Eli commenced his journey west to safely deliver his book. He survives by killing small animals and bartering things that he salvages. Eli has a very calm, unassuming disposition, but is extremely capable when it comes to defending himself. Every night, he quietly reads his book and prays.

Cinematics:

This film captures quite well the vastness and the emptiness of the land. You get the feeling that the land is now mainly desolate, apart from a few pockets where the survivors now inhabit.

The tempo in this film changes rapidly, one moment there is calm and the next its calamity. The fight sequences are as pretty fast. Eli delivers strong measured responses depending upon the threat. The presentation is seamless and it is a very enjoyable action film.

Conclusion:

This is a very enjoyable action film. While, Eli is a very good fighter, he is still only one man, and not invincible. This aspect is also well captured. Thanks to Solara (Mila Kunis) he is able to continue his journey. Watching this show is quite fulfilling, there are some very nice surprises at the end!",1294272000,,1573,4.757352941176471
4101767,4,B003A8FET6,"In a post-apocalyptic world that movie fans have become accustomed to recently, Denzel Washington is trying to deliver the only known copy of the King James Bible to an unknown destination. Along the way he encounters the ruthless leader of a small town, played by the great Gary Oldman, who believes that if he can get his hands on the book, he will be able to expand his influence and consolidate his power. This was an interesting story, with the mystery of where the book is going and why it is heading there always on the viewer's mind. The questions are answered at the end with a surprising plot twist.",1294185600,2,609,4.545454545454546
4101768,2,B003A8FET6,"I'm a fan of both Sci-Fi and the post-apocalypse sub-genre. I tend to cut both a lot of slack because projects in these genres are considerably more ambitious than those in others. I liked the actors in ""The Book of Eli"", and I liked the visually-interesting scenery.

However, I did not care for the somewhat murky, predictable, and largely mis-conceived story.

The notion that the Bible can offer a very small-time thug the means to subjugate an illiterate population in a post-apocalytic world where fewer than 1 in 10,000 have survived is Marxist Hollywood crap.

The notion that God would annoint someone to save a Bible with a message framed in late-middle English instead of bringing forth the next Krishna, Buddha, or Christ to reassert the Truth for a post-apocalyptic time and place is equally improbable.

Finally, the idea that the lead character is both blind and able to hit multiple moving targets at great distance (for a hand gun) while on the run (and otherwise behave like a sighted person in every scene) is far less likely than the alternative: Eli either knew or found a way to learn braille in order to read the book he was given by God, and called to read. Yes, it could be a Christian miracle in which Eli was without sight but given an even more powerful sense by God.

If pressed, I'm willing to buy both this interpretation and its effectiveness in making it clear that Eli was chosen by God, annointed, etc. But if so, why not jam or mis-fire the round that finally brings Eli to his knees? To show that ""God works (or chooses not to work) in mysterious ways?"" To make the point that God is capricious, unpredictable, or unreliable? Either way, this is murky story-telling that only reinforces the audience's murky understanding of the murky Judeo-Christian concept of God... murky indeed.

I really like the notion of depicting a spiritually-uplifted, empowered individual in a post-apocalyptic world. However, in my opinion, this film did not deliver that to anyone who knows and routinely experience the Indwelling Spirit of God. However, it may deliver a vague sense of what Christian religionists and non-religious individuals raised in a post-Christian era might imagine spirituality to be... sad really.

After 24 hours' reflection and a long walk, I add this: Buried deep in this film is an useful truth, the telling of which redeems much: ""We live in a time of such abundance and yet we remain impoverished in knowing the difference between what is precious and what is not."" Contemplating this truth, we become wiser.",1294099200,3,2557,4.864367816091954

will be out there? Water is a precious commodity, but gas is in abundance?

In the end of the movie, he transcribes it to a group that had a printing press, and it is clear that it was a complete Bible.  Oops.

Still perhaps the book of Eli is an abridged version without all the unnecessary filler.  He was being guided by God, so maybe all the parts that had been misinterpreted had been removed from the good book of Eli.  Keep the 10 commandments and all the stuff about loving your neighbor and turning the other cheek, but maybe get rid of some of the animal sacrifice stuff.  Alternatively, it could have simply been one volume like the book of Ester, and in the sequel the new post apocalyptic society then builds their religion around this one section of the bible.",1292112000,3,1127,4.522167487684729

I've never been much of a religious person. And when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself, ""well, Denzel can be pretty bad ass, but this whole Christian vibe has me a bit iffy. I hope it doesn't end up feeling pretentious or anything."" Thankfully, the Hughes Brothers and company managed to surprise me. After finally getting to see the film in theaters, I liked it a lot. The story takes place in a post-Apocalyptic future where Earth has been scorched by war into a barren wasteland and humanity has degraded itself into packs of scavengers and nomads who kill, and even eat, each other just to survive. Enter Eli (Denzel Washington), a man on a mission traveling west to deliver what is apparently the very last copy of the King James Holy Bible. On his journey he comes across a man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman) who is looking for the very same book. But sensing the ill intentions in Carnegie's plan to use it, Eli refuses to give up the book and must fight his way through with the help of a young girl, Solara (Mila Kunis). Thematically speaking, the movie itself isn't so much about Christianity (like I was afraid it would be), but the power of faith and the implied applicability of religion. Being an atheist, I always found it irksome that religion was so misinterpreted and taken out of context and that people were so vehement about it that I decided to stop believing in it altogether. In The Book of Eli, however, I find it refreshing that they can offer such a bold perspective on what it really means to follow in what you believe. Religion was never about which god is the right one or where it all originally started. It was simply about learning, finding something to believe in, possibly teaching and passing it down, and proceeding to pursue those beliefs with your own conviction. Mix bits and pieces of that with some stunning action sequences and a great cast of opposing actors and you've got a pretty good film. By the way, don't let the premise and symbolic inclination fool you. While I, personally, found the quasi-theological undertones enlightening, it's still choreographed by Jeff Imada (most famous for the Bourne films), so take from that what you will. Sci-fi actioners with a message -- gotta' love 'em.

Video - 5.0

I remember seeing this in theaters and thinking that the film quality had a peculiar darkness to it. I was hoping the photography would present itself a little better on BD, and I was right. The movie is very desaturated (as briefly touched upon in the extras) and doesn't have much vibrancy at all until the end of the film. Something like 50-70% of the color scheme was intentionally made to almost monochromatic or like a black and white picture. But in exchange for that drabness, black levels and contrast have an amazing amount of depth and clarity. A lot of the backgrounds were digitally shot or painted and incorporated into the filming and it really, really shows in this transfer. You can see all sorts of fine detail from the little grains of sand in the ground or blowing through the air, the individual follicles and oil reflections from Eli's beard, the dirt and grime on peoples' faces, skin wrinkles and imperfections, notches and kinks in metallic structures, you name it. Backgrounds look especially bleak and reflect the mood of the production design well with ominous cloud cover and very low lighting. Getting back to the black levels, these are among the best I've seen on BD to date. In the scene where Eli fights off the thugs in the underpass you can see his silhouette perfectly, but even better, still make out individual shapes and textures in his clothes and backpack despite the darkness of the tunnel. And best of all, there's very little noise in any of the dark or low-lit scenes. I've never seen anything so immaculately black. Furthermore, black levels make for some great scenic shots that help to compliment the brooding nature of the film itself. One of my favorite shots in the movie (from an aesthetic viewpoint anyway) is when Eli is walking on the destroyed overpass with the camera looking at him from below. Something about the angle of the shot and obvious aftermath of what the wars did to the world is frightening to think about, but at the same time very cool sci-fi stuff. There's very little to complain about in this video transfer, if anything at all, outside of your own personal preference for coloring. What a great effort by WB on this one.

Audio - 5.0

The Book of Eli is an a word - aggressive. From the opening forest sequence we get a steady dose of ambient bass as the camera pans across displaying the state of the world and result of our own destruction via the war that ended civilization. The wind howls eerily along the front sound stage right before Eli shoots his arrow into his soon-to-be dinner as a somewhat jarring thump emanates from the bow. We're then introduced to some of the film's score with an ethereal-sounding piece composed by Atticus Ross during the flash of the movie's title. Afterward, Eli comes upon an abandoned house looking to seek shelter as he kicks the door in and produces an even more jarring LFE. As he searches the house, all the little creaks and cringes of the old wood spread and separate amongst the front and rears. When he settles down for the night, his mp3 player gives us a little of Al Green's ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"" a soothing piece of soul that's definitely a contrast to the world Eli lives in, but makes for a good listen once we get to hear a part of it in full lossless surround. But if you want action, the underpass fight is where things start to make themselves heard. Reverberation is stunning when Eli steps back into the shadows and takes out each of those thugs with his ""samurai machete."" Limbs get sliced and bodies impaled with bloody cold execution, while the chainsaw guy, despite his loud and powerful hardware, basically acts as a test dummy for a rather large blade. But the real highlight of this precision soundtrack is in the town shootout. Guns are fired from a multitude of heights and angles with absolutely zero music resulting in a very impressive display of directionality and dynamics as bullets fly from the right front to left rear, right rear to left front, and any number of combinations therein. Shots echo with deadly accuracy and is probably one of the best shootouts I've heard in a while. The action then comes to a close during another big shootout at the old couple's house. Here we get to hear a good amount of automatic weapons fire, a bomb, a bazooka, and a Gatling gun. It's a pretty awesome sound design.

Extras - 4.0

We start off with Maximum Movie Mode as the movie plays itself like normal with bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage dispersed throughout and little Focus Points icons at certain parts. You push enter on your controller there and it takes you to a separate screen that breaks down whatever aspect they're attempting to explain (usually in 3-4 minute segments). It's a big mix of production design, writing, filming, and commentary about what the cast and crew wanted to achieve in terms of literary themes, symbolism, and entertainment. I actually played the movie at 1.5x speed to make things a little faster but still slow enough to where I could re-watch the film itself while somewhat conserving time. And while the Focus Points can be accessed as a standalone feature (34 minutes worth, total), I still stand by the opinion that watching these during the movie itself adds a good deal of real-time context and perspective to the on-screen action, which is a very cool variation of the Picture-in-Picture track. Next is a 5-minute motion comic (""A Lost Tale: Billy"") that gives a little bit of background information on Carnegie's childhood. It's short, but a good revelation and indicator as to the motivations we see in his current state during the movie. After that is a 13-minute feature (""Starting Over"") talking about some the story's themes, comparing that world to ours, and discussing the symbolism in what it means to truly start over from scratch. ""Eli's Journey"" (about 18-minutes) analyzes the character of Eli himself the production of the film, the casting of Denzel, various collaborations and writing points, and the character's motivations. Both of these features are diced and served in parts throughout Maximum Movie Mode, but feel much more in-depth when watched as complete segments. And then finally is ""'The Book of Eli' Soundtrack,"" which shows a sit-down interview with composer Atticus Ross and co-director Allen Hughes. I was expecting this to delve more into theme composition or instrumentation, but it turned out to be just a session of praise from Hughes and a little bit of confirmation by Ross. Altogether, it amounts just over an hour of extras.

Overall - 4.5

The Book of Eli is a movie that interests me a lot. I was never big on religion, but I like how this film in particular highlighted the context of religion, or faith in general, as a personal driving force rather than as a branch of organized control (which it seems more approximated to be nowadays). It's difficult to explain, though I can say it's certainly given me something of a new perspective on things. Denzel Washington never ceases to amaze me, and it was a delight to see him opposite Gary Oldman. With a philosophical approach to society and civilization, but just the right balance of action, it made for a very entertaining movie. Add to that reference A/V quality and a healthy dose of extras, and The Book of Eli comes highly recommended.",1291248000,3,9646,4.7198813056379825

4101782,4,B003A8FET6,"I was hesitant to watch The Book of Eli for a while because of mixed things I'd read. Some people claimed it to be 'too religious' and others said the movie was just plain boring. Honestly, the trailers I'd seen didn't exactly win me over, but I gave the movie a shot when I was sick one day, and man did I enjoy it. If you've played the Fallout games, especially Fallout 3, you will -love- The Book of Eli. So many similarities in the look of the wasteland, in the combat scenes, the importance of water, and more. But even if you never played Fallout 3, The Book of Eli is a very enjoyable movie, provided you're not one of those people that immediately hates anything 'religious' and claims a movie is preachy, given that the subject matter here is religion...so that kind of makes you weird to say that. I'm not a Christian, and I'm definitely not an Atheist, but I didn't find anything 'preachy' about The Book of Eli.

The world is in shambles. There's no law for the most part. Raiders are everywhere, looting, raping and eating people that pass by. Clean water and food is tough to find. Of course it's a rough life. Most people wouldn't think much of it, but imagine your life as you know it right now taking a turn for the worst, and you no longer have any luxuries- you're a scavenger from now on. That's the world Eli lives in. Eli is on a mission, and tries to stay on the path, as he puts it, and needs to go to a specific location to deliver an important book that no one else is allowed to see or read. At the same time, the ability to read has been lost over the years, and very few people are able to do so. Eli is one, and the other is a corrupt man, Carnegie, who runs a town that Eli enters one day to charge his iPod and haggle with the shop owner. Carnegie wants Eli's book, and will stop at nothing to get it. Unfortunately for him, Eli is practically Zatoichi when it comes to swordplay, and easily dispatches Carnegie's men with his makeshift machete, and is even better with a gun. But Carnegie is relentless, and continues to hunt down Eli.

While the plot itself isn't anything special, the style of the movie is. Rarely do I notice the cinematography in movies, but I noticed it within the first 10 minutes here. The wasteland is gorgeous, as weird as that may sound, and if there were more footage of Eli wandering around in it, I would've been ok with that. The fight scenes are all great- not too long and not too short. Another Fallout 3 connection I saw here was that in the game, you can use VATS (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) to target the enemy's body parts, and get an easy kill/dismemberment that way. I swear, Eli used VATS for all of his kills, because he took out everyone in the same way you would in Fallout 3- precise targeting. There's a big twist near the end of the movie, though I did see it coming when I figured something out about Eli early on that most people didn't, but it's still a great touch, and I had a huge stupid smile on my face when it was revealed. Of course the book he's carrying is obviously The Bible, as you see shots of the cover several times before the halfway point, but I won't say any more about it so that the ending isn't ruined. As I said earlier, I didn't find the movie to be 'preachy' at all, and that's because this is a movie about religion- it doesn't try to be something else, and then throw in a forced message at the last minute. But at the same time, you could've replaced the Bible with any other religious book, and it would've been fine or given the same message. Eli is a man of god, and given how great he is in action, you have to wonder if he hasn't been blessed in some way. But trust me when I say that the movie isn't boring. While it is inspirational, there's plenty of action to go around, including a great scene with an elderly couple, and Eli making good use of his bow and arrow on some thugs. The action is fun, plain and simple. The ONLY bad thing I say is about the immediate ending- the last couple of minutes before the credits roll. I actually said ""you gotta be kidding me"" out loud when it happened, and if I were reviewing just the movie on its own, it'd get 3.5 stars. Had they not gone that route, this would be an easy 4 star movie in my book.

The picture quality on the blu-ray is very good for what it is. The look of the movie is very washed out, with lots of greys, browns and -very- deep blacks. Even with the muted look, details are sharp, and the movie is beautiful to look at. The audio's even better, making excellent use of the DTS-HD Master Audio track. Sandstorms and the sound of wind blowing by are constant, gunshots explode around you, and dialogue is perfectly balanced with everything else, so nothing sounds too loud or quiet compared to whatever else is going on. Very nice work here. There are also 5.1 Spanish and French tracks, as well as subtitles in English, Spanish and French.

As for the extras, The Book of Eli doesn't disappoint here either. Maximum Movie Mode is here, allowing you to watch the movie with picture-in-picture of storyboards and concept art for their matching scenes. It's very cool, and makes me wish there were an art book for the movie so I could have an easier time looking at everything! You also get 10 Focus Points, which are featurettes on different aspects of making the movie like weapons, stunts, design and more. Basically, everything you'd get on a commentary track is in these two features right here. There's an animated comic, A Lost Tale, that runs for about 5 minutes and kind of shows what made Carnegie the man he is in the movie. I didn't care for the animation, and there isn't much to it when it comes down to it, but it's still nice to have. Rounding out the extras are a quick featurette on the movie's soundtrack, a few minutes of deleted/alternate scenes (nothing important here) and two good featurettes: one about the rise and fall of civilizations and rebuilding society, and a basic featurette going over the making of the movie (script/filming).

Overall, this is a great blu-ray, and if it weren't for that head shakingly bad ending, I would've given this 5 stars. The Book of Eli is one of the better post-apocalyptic movies out there (especially since it doesn't ruin anything by cramming zombies into the mix), and I'd put close to the same level as A Boy & His Dog. Heck, have a movie night with those two and enjoy some Fallout 3 when everything's over. Have an ice cold Nuka-Cola, and you've got a friday night right there.",1289606400,78,6535,4.357670221493027

4101785,5,B003A8FET6,"There's enough here on the story and the acting, so I won't go into those much.  To me, the unheralded star of this film is the cinematographer--this film is an amazing collection of images that are stunning in their power.  From the opening scene with the cat until the end of the film, we're treated to a fascinating display of segments that help immensely to establish mood, move the story forward, and keep us looking forward to more.  Anyone studying filmmaking should watch this to learn a lot about potential techniques.

I loved the story, and the twist at the end is as good as the wedding ring in ""The Sixth Sense.""  To the filmmakers' credit, by the time we learn what we learn, it's actually believable in a literary sense.  Who cares about logic and the definition of ""impossible"" based on our limited knowledge--this story takes us past what we think we know and gets us to thinking about what may be.

Denzel Washington does a great job bringing us Eli, and the supporting cast also hits their roles dead on.  The violence is never gratuitous, and they do a good job of not rubbing our faces in it to shock us into repulsion.

In spite of the reviewers who will have you believe otherwise, this is not a ""Christian"" propaganda film--all of the Bible verses quoted are from the Old Testament (except a bit of the Lord's Prayer, I believe), and the Old Testament is not of Christian origin.  Rather, this is a tale of true faith, of putting trust in God and seeing the benefits of maintaining that trust.  And no matter what our religious beliefs, this is one of the themes that has occurred in all types of literature since people began writing.

All in all, highly recommended as a film that will make you think and feel about life in different ways, a film that points out what life could be like if we lose all that we have--so let's appreciate it all while we have it, instead of taking it for granted!",1288483200,4,1920,4.485632183908046

But if overtly religious themes bother you, this movie may bother you as well, particularly as you approach the end, when the action lessens and the religious message takes over.

I'm capable of falling in either of these camps, but I emphasized the former for this movie, so I liked the movie overall, though I didn't love it.  This certainly isn't a truly profound movie, and I don't think it will be one of those movies that I remember for a long time.

4101798,4,B003A8FET6,"Though the film is based on the original script by first-time writer Gary Whitta, the mood and atmosphere of ""The Book of Eli"" feels more like that of a Western or a graphic novel. Some viewers may think the film's premise is similar to that of the 2009 film ""The Road,"" but unlike the Cormac McCarthy adaptation and its grim realism, action-packed ""The Book of Eli"" aims more for entertainment, but not in the same way as the ""Mad Max"" series did years ago. And the film's story itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief, its ending in particular.

Set in the bleak world of post-apocalyptic USA, ""The Book of Eli"" follows the tale of a lone man (Denzel Washington) travelling across the country, carrying a certain book. Not much is known about him - except he has been wandering for 30 years and that to protect the book, he is ready to fight and kill. And he is very good at that.

The man arrives at a town dominated by a local mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie has a monopoly on the town's water that is still uncontaminated after the global disaster. He is looking for a book to consolidate his status as ruler of the community, and he is going to have it no matter what it takes.

""The Book of Eli"" is directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, known for ""From Hell,"" adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Their inspiration comes from many sources - Segio Leone, for instance. Eli's fighting style looks more like a swordsman's. It is fast and deadly.

With the cast including Ray Stevenson, Tom Waits, Jennifer Beals and Michael Gambon and its impressive visual sense, ""The Book of Eli"" succeeds in what it sets out to do, Post-Apocalyptic Western action.",1284854400,,1711,4.636963696369637

At least the intentions of Gary Oldman's character of wanting to use the bible to control the masses was a breath of fresh air because it rings true to how most fanatical Christians were... still are.

4101807,1,B003A8FET6,"A near total waste of time for Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman, both of whom have done much better in the past. Eli is predictable, derivative, and ultimately way too preachy. The movie plays like some kind of teenager's video game, with Denzel lopping off hands, running through a dozen people at a time with his super-sharp machete, and using hand and shotgun to blast away about twice that many more whenever he's threatened. Of course throughout all of this Eli gets away with nary a scratch, at least until the silly plot demands that everything be pulled together in a certain way, no matter how unbelievable it may be.

Gary Oldman as Carnegie looks mad throughout (and really quite oily)---not much of a change from his last few performances. Remember Bram Stoker's Dracula? See that for a fine Oldman performance. Not many do weird as well as Gary O. But in Eli...feh! Who cares what he says or does. Jennifer Beals is completely underutilized, and Mila Kunis as Solara is almost instantly forgettable as Eli's roaming companion. Check the ending (if you make it that far), where for lack of a better plot device Solara inherits the mantle. Gotta keep things going, after all. The Word must get out. Again, unbelievable and dumb.

In sum, I couldn't help but wonder if the need to fit in all the religious stuff got in the way of anyone's thinking that it just might have been religion that caused all the devastation in the first place. Guess we're supposed to believe that the torch must be carried not matter what.",1283472000,5,1528,4.697761194029851
4101808,4,B003A8FET6,"Of the two post-apocalyptic movies released in the last year -- ""The Book of Eli"" and ""The Road"" -- I think I enjoyed ""Eli"" much more.

That's because it plays almost like a Twilight Zone episode -- or the first ""Planet of the Apes"" movie, written if my memory serves me by Rod Serling -- with a neat twist (or two or three) at the end.

""Eli"" is beautifully photographed in bleak shades of brown, and it features an excellent cast, with splendid turns by Denzel as the bad-ass survivor on a sacred mission, Gary Oldman as the villain Carnegie, and Mila Kunis as, well, the eye candy (and eventually Eli's companion on his journey).

The fight scenes are topnotch as well, and not too bloody, considering the amount of carnage.

I have deducted a star only because of the absence of extras on the DVD.  This practice must stop!  Presumably the studio will release an enhanced version in five or ten years featuring the extras that should have been included from day one.

So you might want to rent this or borrow it from your public library first.  And buy it when the ""deluxe"" edition finally and inevitably hits the shelves.

4101809,5,B003A8FET6,"I found it a very satisying story . Plenty to keep the attention riveted, be curious about. Had a satisfying ending, general humanistic and related to that/in that way, some christian themes, etc. But this is woven into a good action plot. I'd call it a thoughtful action movie - nonthinkers and thinkers alike would enjoy it if they like action movies at all.

Good acting, particularly the key characters. Didn't glorify evil strength as the only way to ultimately survive (to the contrary), nor did it overly sensationalize or exaggerate the violence of the fight scenes, which were filmed with a more b&w palette than other scenes, perhaps to portray that life is at these times a very ugly and harsh reality.

Film starts out with Denzel walking westwards in post-apocolyptic future (in barren desert, as usual). Fight scene style is sort of a mashup of ""private ryan"" flavor blended with street/martial fighting choreography - so though it's rough, hurray, it's not the dumb comic-book quentin tarentino style. Though we aren't sure right away, little things before and after show us he's a decent guy under the badass. What is not answered is how how did he became so resilient, and how did he learn to be so competent a figher? (like clint eastwood's ""pale rider""). There's the usual bad guys abusing people and resources along the way, and he gets to save a few lives. Due to attention to detail, the story is credibly done (for this genre); and not overly romanticized or glam. For some reason all the bibles were hunted down and burned (shades of fahrenheit 451). Note the map on the wall behind villain's desk. It's always interesting how denzel's character reacts, what he says. Also interesting that we see seeds of the human need of little beauty and spiritual in a few others when exposed to what denzel's character says as a decent person or quotes from the bible. The villain misses the book of eli but wants it for power, and denzel needs to bring it to where will be used for good. Unintended funny - in a gunfight he shoots 22-28 bullets out of a semi handgunt, never reloading - it just  kept going, and going like the ever-ready bunny, Gee, even in the Matrix they had to reload much sooner.",1283212800,2,2214,4.686375321336761

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The end of the world as we know it. It is such a morbid topic, yet pop culture embraces it so tightly. They also seem to embrace Jersey Shore and conspiracy theories with the same fervor, but it doesn't seem as saturated. In the past 6 months, we have had the opportunity to see 2012, Legion, The Tooth Fairy, and, our topic film, The Book of Eli. All four movies deal with some sort of ""end of the world as we know it"" theme(I'm guessing The Tooth Fairy does, since Dwayne Johnson in ballet tights sounds to be in line with rivers turning to blood and locust swarms).

  I can only guess that the reason is to say to the audience, ""Aw, you can't buy a new car after 2 years? Well, it could be worse."" Personally, I'd rather laugh at a decent comedy, but to each their own.

  The Book of Eli takes place about 30 years after a massive war broke out upon the earth. Nuclear warfare apparently destroyed the ozone layer, and anyone taking a leisurely stroll in the park or walking their dog was burnt to a crisp. The lucky ones, who were inside watching Jerry Springer, survived, and did what they could to continue surviving for about a year, when they were finally able to go out into a barren wasteland the likes of the video game Fallout 3. At least, that's what ""Walker""(Denzel Washington) tells us, along with some reflective Christian teachings and an anecdote about being wasteful and having more than you need.

  Walker is a man who has been walking for over 30 years across the remaining United States of America to deliver a bible out west. The actual place he needs to go is unknown. All Walker knows is that he'll have a feeling when he arrives. Why it takes him 30 years to walk across the USA is something you learn later.

  In his travels he forages for food and water, fights off ambush parties, listens to his iPod, and reads the bible. He comes across a town run by Gary Oldman, who has been searching for a bible to help control his little town. Obviously, Walker isn't going to give it up without a fight, because then there would hardly be any movie to watch.

  So what's good about this movie? Well, the scenery is awesome. Anyone who played the video game Fallout 3 will feel quite at home with the landscapes. It's almost as if images were lifted from the game and shot live-action, begging for a live-action movie of its own.

  The depiction of life post-apocalyptica is interesting, as well. Of course, we've seen most of this before in the Mad Max series, but it is thought-provoking just the same.

  Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman do a great job with what they are given as characters. Anyone less would have probably made me walk out of this film. Sadly, there is only so much that talented actors can do to keep a film above water. Mila Kunis is good eye candy, especially in a movie where most people have weird growths coming out of their faces. The rest of the movie just gets drawn out and annoying.

  For one, the ""twist""(for spoiler-free purposes) of Walker is aggravating. If you look back on the movie, you can understand why he does certain things because of this twist, but at the same time there are other elements and shots that don't make sense. It seems that half the time, the director is fighting between storyline and scenery. Obviously, scenery kept on winning, making the movie pretty shallow.

  The religious theme also irked me, but not as much as I'd thought. While Gary Oldman's interpretation as the Devil incarnate was fantastic, the use of theology to explain away how Walker keeps on trucking is tired and uninteresting. Granted, it's hard to do the movie without the book of Eli, but with the human side of Walker coming only at the very, very end, it's hard to take the religious overtones seriously.

  In the end, I give this movie 2 out of 5 Pip-Boy 3000s.",1283126400,6,4077,4.616666666666666
4101813,4,B003A8FET6,"The music is haunting, the landscape stark, and the action sparse yet violent. Wandering through this wasteland, Denzel Washington is Eli, a machete-wielding stoic on a mission to carry a mysterious book to safety in the west. He travels alone. He encounters marauders and cannibals. ""Stay on the path . . . it's not my concern"" is the mantra running through his head, as he maneuvers this post-apocalyptic obstacle course.

Carnegie is the man standing in his way. Carnegie, played by Gary Oldham with a fine balance between restraint and melodrama, is the self-appointed mayor of an outlaw town, where people barter for food and water, where terror rules. Carnegie is old enough to remember the days before the war that destroyed life as we know it, and he understands the power of one book to shape and manipulate the masses to his will. He calls this religious book ""a weapon,"" but he intends to use it for his own purposes. Eli, on the other hand, wants to use this weapon for good, just as he uses his machete to divvy out his own forms of righteous judgment. Along the way, he finds a friend in Solara, a young woman wanting to escape the madness of Carnegie's town, but only toward the end of the story does Eli realize that his own preoccupation with saving the book has blinded him to its central messages of love and self-sacrifice.

The movie plods forward just as Eli does, step by step, slowly, methodically, but with purpose and faith. Some have called that boring, whereas I appreciated directors who treated us with respect and allowed us time to care about the characters and think over the themes. What may seem heavy-handed the first time through becomes more subtle and intriguing when watching again. There are layers to this story that move me emotionally. It's not a perfect film, but it's one that has the courage to pursue a purpose and do so artistically.

I saw it in theaters, bought the DVD, and added the soundtrack to my wish list. This is one ""book"" that still means something new every time I ""open"" it up.",1283040000,4,2040,4.645429362880886

4101815,5,B003A8FET6,"Every once in a while Hollywood comes out with a movie which is both prophetic and spiritual in nature. Granted, this movie has some very good action in it; however, that is not the important theme of it: It is all about spiritual warfare. This wonderful movie is about a man (Eli ~ Denzel Washington) whom was given a purpose (mission) by GOD to deliver a Bible to a given destination. Eli is tested (persecuted) in many various ways along his way (path, walk) in the desert.  These tests were physical, psychological, sexual and spiritual in order to test his faith, strength and determination.  What is obvious here is that Eli followed the Gospel, and people came out of the wood-work to destroy him and his ""walk"" in the LORD.  Although they tried to recruit him, they finally sent an Army after him because Eli wouldn't conform to their world and kept on his walk of faith foot-by-foot.  What is not obvious to Eli's enemies is that he is supernaturally protected during all of his trials and tribulations.  After watching this movie for the 4th time, I finally realized that Eli was blind and the LORD walked him through every event in a supernatural way:  Just like the famous line in the movie, ""I walk by faith and not by sight.""  What seems prophetic in this movie is that people will eventually kill for Bibles and the Word of the LORD:  Bibles will eventually become very valuable in the future because there will be very few of them around.",1283040000,2,1454,4.586872586872587

For starters I am a fan of Denzel Washington and generally appreciate the movies he's in; this was instrumental in my watching the movie in the first place. I had been warned it was dark and sometimes hard to tell what was happening but I didn't really have that problem with it.

The movie is depressing and focuses on the seamier side of life in a world which has been destroyed by an apocalyptic event. The mankind pictured has been forced into survival mode with the survival of the strong at the expense of the weak. I was reminded of the Mel Gibson Mad Max series so if you liked those you'll probably like this one too. I didn't like those either.

4101822,5,B003A8FET6,"WARNING: Some spoilers ahead

I saw The Book Of Eli (2010) in the theater the day after it was released in January.  I liked it very much.  Denzel Washington was on top of his game in this film.  So was Gary Oldman.  This movie also stars Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals.

I'll briefly sum up the plot like this:  It is a post-apocalytic world.  Thirty years earlier the apocalytic event took place.  A man named Eli (Denzel Washington) has in his possession the last remaining King James version of the Bible in the world.  Yes, that's right.  He's a wandering nomad who's on a mission to deliver the Bible to a safe haven in the western part of the U.S.  He travels on foot.  It turns out that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay ends up being the safe haven.  Along the way to San Francisco, Eli encounters a lot of danger from thieves.  He defeats his adversaries quite easily with his great fighting skills.  He also shows great survival skills.  Eli runs into Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a man who is hell bent on obtaining the Bible.  Carnegie's blind concubine named Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli water and some food.  Carnegie's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) finds out Eli has some kind of book in his possession, but she doesn't know what the book is.  When Carnegie asks her what kind of book it is, she just indicates that there is a cross symbol on the cover.  Carnegie realizes it's a Bible.  Eli and his company seek a safe haven in a house, where the residents, Martha (Frances de la Tour) and George (Michael Gambon) are armed and ready at all times.  After an ambush of the house, Carnegie gets possession of the Bible by forcing Eli to hand it over.  Eli gets shot at one point, but continues on as if he isn't hurt very much.  To further sum it up, Eli makes it to Alcatraz and recites the entire Bible from memory.  Carnegie has the actual book.  Carnegie opens up the book and discovers it's written in braille because Eli, as it turns out, is blind.  Claudia (who is blind) refuses to read it to him.  After Eli is done reciting the Bible from memory, he expires from his wounds.  Solara walks home instead of living at Alcatraz.

Some things in this movie are quite unbelievable, such as how a blind man can fight and kill people, how there's only one Bible left in the world (even though it was stated in the movie that all the Bibles were burned).  You mean there's not a spare copy lying around somewhere on planet Earth?  But.........the whole point of this movie is to show how the power of the Bible and faith can protect a person from danger and empower them (if you believe in it, of course).

Overall, it's a good action movie that's quite moving.  I recommend it.",1282521600,4,2696,4.443762781186094
4101823,5,B003A8FET6,What a great movie.  I love the versatility of Denzel Washington and his acting.  Glad I purchased it I will watch this one over and over again. Thanks,1282521600,,151,4.357142857142857

Now, Denzel is openly playing a religious zealot in this film. I hope he doesn't continue down the Gibson road. Just look @what a train wreck Mel's life has turned into. Denzel: don't move to Malibu. Also, stay away from the sauce!!

Oh, as an aside. The film style is minimalist. The style will register w/a small number of viewers. The character development is also too little, too late. Those two factors are why this film flopped when it was released. I like Denzel & Gary Oldman very much. They couldn't save this film, though. Were it not for them.

I was impressed with the cinematrography but it grew old and then I looked for the story which this film really doesn't have. I understand a lot of people have credited this film and some have even discussed their disagreement with the central character and wondered what religion he belongs to. I, sadly, am never going to reach that stage because this film doesn't deserve discussion. In some way, it's hopeless, lacks any half intelligent dialog, the only thing effective is the soundtrack, the action sequences are bizzare and I feel today's audience is too intelligent and a tad bit too impatient to sit through something like this. Atleast this is my opinion. The film had absolutely no premise, there is just one central character of Washington who acts like he's a messiah of some sort, at no point in this film is any wit, any humor, any heartfelt emotion displayed. I'm a big Washington fan but I was disappointed he made something like this.

4101830,4,B003A8FET6,"This was a very different kind of movie for Denzel Washington.  Playing a mysterious loner named Eli, Denzel Washington has spent the last 30 years of his life walking west through a post-apocalyptic United States with what could be the last copy of the King James Bible - all because a voice in his head told him to.  He doesn't seem to understand exactly why he is doing this, but sustains the faith to do so anyway.  Along his route on the Highway of Death, he encounters much evil and hopelessness.  Still, he stays true to his mission and keeps going.

Eventually he encounters Gary Oldman, playing a callous town overseer, who will stop at nothing to get the book that Eli carries and reads from every day. The plot soon turns into a good versus evil conflict with a spiritual undertone.  Eli gets the upper hand when he receives help from a young woman (Mila Kunis) who doesn't understand what the world was like before ""The Flash"" occurred and changed life forever, but who believes in Eli and wants a better life for herself and her mother.

The ending of this science-fiction film is really what makes it.  It sends a powerful message about life, faith, spirituality, and hope.  If I had one criticism about this movie, it would be that it reminds me too much of the film, ""The Road,"" which was out around the same time.

In his way is a would-be messiah (played by a Dracula-like Gary Oldman) and very bad lighting.  The plot is very messy, and the post-apocalyptical world happens to be even more absurd than the world we live in now.  The ending is bathetic, and really does draw on for much too long (believe it or not, it's even more of a drawn out ending than that of ""The Shawshank Redemption.""

4101834,3,B003A8FET6,"This is a movie made in the spirit of other movies not the spirit of reality. That's OK. Its entertaining because it indulges in well proven tropes. So kick back, put your brain in neutral and enjoy.

The very first thing on screen is the cat. Most of the reviewers refer to it as a feral cat. In fact it's a purebred sphynx cat. This is a hairless breed that has a lot of health problems. It certainly couldn't survive in the wild today much less in the chilly post apocalyptic future. But that's OK. It immediately signals to the audience that this is just a fantasy.

Denzel is of course an old man. In real life he's in his late fifties and he looks it. Before modern medicine the life expectancy was about thirty six. In a post apocalyptic world old men like him would have a hard time just staying alive. One little scratch could lead to a terminal infection. But it's OK. It is possible for an occasional old man to survive, if he was careful.

But of course Denzel isn't careful. He has a tendency to find himself surrounded by groups of armed men intent on his destruction. He seems incapable of recognizing danger soon enough so as to avoid a face to face confrontation. But it's OK, Denzel is a great swordsman and pistolero and archer etc...

In movies samurai style sword fighting is the most effective. In reality of course the Samurai were never successful in battle against anyone other than a Samurai and the Samurai sword was a lousy sword. But it's OK, Samurai style sword fighting may not be effective but it is certainly cinematic.

Later Denzel is surrounded once again by adversaries - this time with guns. Then Denzel eschews his sword and pulls out his pistol and shotgun. You might wonder why in his previous encounters he had endangered himself by fighting masses of armed men in close quarters when he could have shot them from a distance. Saving ammo? But it's OK, not only can no bad guy cut him with a sword, ax or chain saw, no one can hit him with a bullet either. Ray Stevenson the top bad guy fighter who shoots apparently without regard to scarce ammunition can't seem to hit Denzel in the back from twenty feet - twice.

Later yet Denzel shoots two baddies with his bow. You might think that he finally has decided to save ammunition, but no. He doesn't bother to retrieve his arrows but leaves them in the bodies for Gary Oldman to discover shortly. But it's OK, his bow is a ridiculously weak one. Even the small young woman tagging along can destring it with one hand.

Next Denzel and the girl meet the cannibals (all such movies have cannibals). You might wonder why like Clint Eastwood in The Unforgiven someone doesn't just raise pigs. Not sure about that but like almost every other such movie the amazingly lethal action star wanders around in the desert and sooner or later meets some cannibals. But it's OK, Gary Oldman shows up and shoots the cannibals saving Denzel the trouble. Gary arrives with four Mad Max style DIY tanks. His most powerful weapon is somehow a Civil War vintage Gatling Gun - for which he apparently has plenty of ammunition.

It's more than a little odd that there in this dystopian future everyone is armed with old weapons. Denzel has a WWII vintage canteen. Although he talks a lot about water both he and the girl seem to be able to hike across the desert for days sustained only on the one quart capacity of this canteen. Neat trick. But it's OK they also have WWII vintage grenades which somehow are incredibly powerful yet never endanger the thrower with shrapnel.

The whole Bible trope was better done in ""A Canticle for Liebowitz"". Indeed the critics seem to be divided between those who think this movie is anti-Christian and those think it's a fundamentalist religious rant. But it's OK the book thingee is obviously just a McGuffin - as Hitchcock once explained - an arbitrary device that motivates the action.

One is post-Apocalyptic fatigue.  Seems like there have been many such movies over the last few years (""The Road"", ""Doomsday"", and ""Resident Evil - Extinction"" come to mind).  After a while, these start to look and feel alike.  The second problem is the premise -- that somehow bibles have become non-existent.  Considering how many bibles have been printed and distributed since forever, this seems quite implausible.  There are certainly many more bibles than guns--and the movie had no lack of guns. Also there probably weren't enough people left after ""The Flash"" to mount a campaign to burn all bibles.  Aned even if there were, people were probably too preoccupied with surviving to care.

The synopsis is covered in great detail above (and in other reviews) so I won't spend too long on that, or put in any spoilers, but this story is so much more than was quite unfairly described by one professional critic as ""The Road Warrior (Mad Max) without cars!""
Denzel Washington plays a nomadic man on a mission, wandering for some 30 years through a post apocalyptic landscape carrying the last known copy of the King James Bible, answering a calling, and quest to deliver it somewhere important, knowing only that he must go west.
Like the aforementioned ""Road"" he is waylaid by marauding gangs, cannibalism, and a general dystopian population left either blind or maimed by whatever catastrophe occurred. Enter Gary Oldman as a intelligent but malevolent self proclaimed leader of a small town, surviving in the dust and misery, hell bent on getting his hand on the book, and hoping to rekindle the power of faith in people for his own ends.
That's about it in a nutshell really, there are some other characters of course, and little subplots, and for those familiar with the Book of Eli in the Bible itself, there are some obvious connotations added, but these are never overplayed.
I want to talk about the film itself for a second and the camera work and CGI, the Blu-Ray transfer is as crisp as I have seen, and they have made this World so believable and real on screen, you can almost taste the dust. The heavily tinted camera work adds depth, and a grey despair to the whole movie, which arguably would have much flatter without it. The story itself is clever, if a little unbelievable at times, and is much more stylized than other movies of the genre, but it feels right for this movie. The acting is great from everyone, even another little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.
Not a movie for repeat viewing I fancy, once you know the end, have lived the ""journey"" and got to the twist in the tale, but nonetheless a very good movie.
Plenty of action pads out the more thoughtful aspects of the film, as Denzel is a sort of machete wielding one man army, as if possessed by a higher power (again the nod to religion) in his single minded of purpose, and unyielding journey.

Made you feel like you were there. It does have a spiritual meaning in it as well, but if you aren't very spititual yourself, it isn't overwhelming, and you can still really enjoy this film.

Furthermore, there is a good bit of theological symbolism thrown in as well, all of which makes it an unusual movie to come out of Hollywood.  Christian fundamentalists may find it doesn't fit their strict ideas very well, and on the other side of the spectrum those who are actively non-JudeoChristian may well be offended when confronted with the message of the movie, which is the gospel.

DVD disc features are bare with only language and subtitle selections, no extras.  I don't mind trailers listed within the special features when I can play each one at a time and I do frequently view the trailers.  But dislike having to be forced to view trailers at startup.

4101850,4,B003A8FET6,"_The Book of Eli_ (2010)starring Denzil Washington as the prophet Eli features a world destroyed by war brought on by religion and hate.  Few humans remain left and water has become a scarce commodity.  Many of the humans have resorted to cannibalism and those who attack the wandering Eli are quickly despatched with his savage blade.  Eli enters a town where he is able to teach a young girl about his religious belief and to pray to God.  However, the leader of the town seeks to impose his will upon the people and has been searching for a copy of the Bible so he may use it towards his evil ends (he also seems to enjoy biographies of Mussolini).  Only one copy of the Bible remains in existence and that is the property of Eli who maintains that he must ""head West"" under the guidance of a voice he has heard ""from within himself"" so that he may find an appropriate place for the Bible.  A series of massive gun fights ensue and a couple George and Martha (Washington?) are brought into the matter which occurs in an epic showdown between Eli, the girl, George and Martha, and the rest of the gang looking for the Book outside of a white house.  Eli is wounded but the girl manages to escape; however, the leader has managed to attain the Book despite the fact that he has been injured.  Eli manages to head further West with the girl where he encounters a second remaining society.  This society has a library set up and seeks to spread all human knowledge to the world again through its printing press.  The library contains much of Western culture including books by Shakespeare and the music of Wagner as well as Britannica encyclopedias.  Eli tells the girl that he contains the Bible in his heart and begins dictating the entire Bible to an old wisened librarian who eventually is to complete the entire dictation thus preserving forever knowledge of the Bible (which will be set to the printing press).  In the meantime, after trying to pick the lock on his own Bible the leader of the town discovers that the Bible is written in Braile.  He attempts to have his blind mistress read it for him but she refuses.  Eventually the illiterate men of his town are to revolt against their master.  In the meantime, Eli slowly dies of the wound inflicted upon him but not before completing the entire Bible.  In this manner, the Bible and teachings of Christ will be passed on to a future post-apocalyptic generation.  Earlier in the film Eli had noted that in the war of the past books were burned and destroyed with the exception of the Bible.  I feel that this may be a reference to the internet in which books are pillaged and information is ripe for rampant abuse.  At the end of the film, the girl manages to set out back for home carrying her mission from Eli to return home.  I felt this film was spiritually fulfilling a vacuous post-apocalyptic world.  Eli notes that in the world before the apocalypse people had much but did not appreciate what they had.  His personal faith is quite touching in light of the hostility to such faith in the modern world.  The end of the movie explains the importance of cultural and religious preservationism and through the medium of the printing press the Bible and the Gospel of Christ will continue to live on a for a future generation of people.

My main criticism of the film is the excessive violence that Eli delivers in brutally killing animals for food and his opponents in battle.  Eli spares none and carries a sharp blade which he uses to torture and kill all his opponents.  I felt that this was somewhat unbecoming in a film about spiritual truth that emphasizes the golden rule.  The harshness and violence of the film detract from the overall message I felt and for this reason I only gave the film 4 stars.",1280620800,2,3774,4.536189069423929

Nuclear war aftermath movies have been done many times. Trust me, not like this one.
Mr. Washington has been walking west for the past 30 years. He has a definitive purpose. That purpose & the surrounding elements are revealed in the end. You feel you know the ending; it's predictable. Nope, there is a very good twist or two which will surprise you.

4101852,1,B003A8FET6,"I have been reading the reviews - And was surprised that many people really liked this movie.  There are a few that didn't like this movie.  I am firmly in the camp of not liking the movie.  For me it was a Christian version of Mad Max and Fahrenheit 451. Where after a great apocalyptic religious war all the bibles were destroyed and the only one left is the one that Eli carries.

SPOILERS  (So there I warned you)

Although we know that this movie would be in part have Christian over tones, if anyone is familiar with Christianity, they would know the name Eli. Eli does the Christian's (g)od `s will in the Christian Bible (Old Testament)  Eli is a Judge Priest .  Eli over time loses his eye sight and becomes blind.

We see elements of this in the movie. As for a religious movie - It showed a man wandering for 30 years bleak stricken and horrifying remains of what was the United States.  People have turned to cannibalism to survive, eating what we would consider pets, and people reduced to lawlessness.

I have no problem with the level of violence - I loved the mad max movies - Because it's fantasy it's not real.  Yes, eating a cat was disturbing, and although I was upset, but the point was, that these are hard times, pets are food, and people will do what they need to survive.

We see Eli do things to survive and I have no problem with that.

I can even understand Carnegie desire for the Christian Bible, he believes in it's power, to create a society of order, his order, but order none-the-less. He lusts for the power that he believes that it will bring. I can even understand why he might send out people who can't read to search for it. (Although, really, wouldn't you want someone who could read, and have some kind of intelligence find something this important?  Wouldn't you want someone who could at least think?  Be able to reason where it would be? If all the bibles were burned, would it really make sense to send out goons to find it, wouldn't you want learned people and search out place that might have hoarded one, two or three? And please, don't tell me that people would just blindly (yea I know pun) not have digital versions tucked away somewhere? Or whatever... )

Getting back to the movie - I expected great acting from Denzel and Oldman. Neither came through, I felt like they phoned in scenes. I wasn't convinced (SPOILER Alert) at the end that Eli was blind.

I wasn't convinced of the total breakdown of society would break down even more when Carnegie was near death.
The major problem I had with the ending where we find out that the Bible was Braille, was that the New King's James Version of the bible isn't one book, it takes 20 Volumes - YES--that means 20 books - for one written bible.  So, Eli's one volume Braille bible is unbelievable.

Other problems I have with the movie is, if Eli is on (g)od's journey, why didn't he stop the woman from being raped? I know he is not meant to be perfect and we see this to show later when he admits not being perfect. So, a woman is allowed to get raped because the main character needs to realize that he isn't perfect?  Humm... I have issues with that.

The movie seemed to drag, then get an action scene, then drag, then action. The amount of action left you wanting more of an explanation then you got. I didn't find it thought provoking or something unique or interesting.  I found it boring, clichd, predictable, and underwhelming.

There was really no pay off at the end, because you knew that Eli, although protected by (g)od through the movie was now allowed to die, after of course he recited the complete New King James Bible.

I would have liked to know more about Eli before the war. I would have liked to know what he was, why he was so convinced that he was being played by his (g)od. I would have liked to know what really brought on the destruction, other than it was some kind of religious war.",1280534400,13,3910,4.397222222222222
4101853,2,B003A8FET6,"Bottom line: everything is magic and stop asking questions.
I decided to give this movie two stars for this simple reason: it earned one because it's horrible and then I gave it another one for being able to trick me into actually going to the theatre to see it.

No spoilers review:
This movie is decent if you don't take things too seriously and just want something stupid to look at for a couple hours to waste time. It's marginally entertaining, just don't expect the plot to hold up to even the lightest of probing.

Spoilers review *Don't read if you don't want it ruined*:
I knew I was going to be in trouble when I saw Mila Kunis as her acting is usually pretty inexcusable, but I have to give her credit on this one. For once she wasn't the problem.
I prefer apocalyptic films like The Road, where the main character is not an infallible super-god casually hacking and blasting his way through a sea of enemies like this was Resident Evil on easy mode or something. So I was almost immediately slightly disappointed. Nothing is a challenge for Eli. He could murder rapists with both arms tied behind his back.
And of course the movie uses that tired old premise where one dusty old loner picks up a sidekick against his will and then instantly warms up to them and would do anything to protect them...

*Serious spoilers! Beware*
The most annoying twist in the whole movie is when Eli turns out to be blind and everything that he did in the movie up to that point is all because of magic, I suppose. Your guess is as good as mine. There is no way he could have done half the stuff he did in the film up to that point without his sight (hunting a completely silent cat with a bow and arrow), so the answer must be magic!

The movie really ""jumped the shark"" when Eli's bible is destroyed and with his last dying breath he must dictate a new one to Malcolm McDowell. I guess being blind also gives you incredible time control powers, because it would take forever to dictate the bible to someone. To say nothing of the fact that one man would never be able to memorize the entire thing! I'm guessing this was an extremely paraphrased (IE completely made up) version.

It's like someone had a very, very vague idea for a movie and no one felt like ironing out a plot first, so they said, ""Let's just start filming and we'll come up with something as we go.""",1280448000,8,2363,4.373576309794989

As did Ms. Kunis showing a different side of herself. The actors picked were great!

It was deep and the acting superb.

We agree...you will need to watch it twice to catch a lot of small things that you will likely miss the first time.

I don't want to give it away, so I will make just a couple of comments.

When asked what was different back ""then"", Washington remarked, ""we threw things away that people kill each other to get now."" (i.e. WATER, chapstick, hand wipes??!)  I believe it. The excesses of ""yesterday"" are beginning to catch up with us...even today.

Totally believeable that 40 years from now, the minority of this country will NOT know how to read. The ones who can will be the powerful, the ones who can't...

It's hard to comment much more based on the fact that I don't want to give any more away but the bottom line is:  This film is well-worth watching and confirms what Believers already know...despite being in the world, we are not OF it and we ultimately have the victory!",1280361600,3,1173,4.564593301435407
4101856,5,B003A8FET6,"This movie is an allegory or parable of life and the religious urges of human beings thrown into relief with the politics and greed we aspire to pull ourselves up from and grow beyond. All religions from the history of humanity look for higher explanations, higher things. Those things alone are worth dedicating your life to. We walk through a wasteland and yearn for heaven. We feel guided by forces, sometimes only in retrospect. This is the allegory for our lives. The allegory for our minds so adapted to learn and grow and bestow our gifts on this world, whatever they might be. Huge themes of life and human spirit are coursing through the film at so many levels that they hit me straight in the heart, and a dam of emotions burst forth. I can't remember when I have seen a movie like it recently.

  In my opinion, no movie library is complete without it. The themes in this movie are THE themes of life. the violence and other themes you would think kids should not see are completely de-fused, and nearly unnoticeable against the backdrop of the life, truth, and faith themes echoing from this film.

Washington is the ""Walker"" and has a mission. While professing to read his bible every day he goes through several scenes like River Tam in a room full of Reavers. A slaughterhouse on two legs, ""Walker"" wanders across the country seemingly happy to be alone and listening to his iPod. Eventually it needs a recharge so he goes into a town where main character #2, Gary Oldman, has a shabby dictatorship. (Honestly, I've never been an Oldman fan and while he does a passable job as the bad guy, an Alan Rickman would have been more effective.) Oldman shows what a baddie he is by pimping out his girlfriends (Jennifer Beal in a surprisingly effective performance) daughter played by Mila Kunis.

Without giving away too much and spoiling the ending, when all was revealed I found myself having a ""WTF?"" moment, immediately followed by several ""but then how did..."" questions. Probably the answer to all of the questions is ""faith"", but still...

Hollywood seems to view religion as something that should either be ignored or mocked in films. Then along comes The Book of Eli, which dares to take a reverential view of religious faith.

The title character, forcefully portrayed by Denzel Washington, is a man on a mission. In a post-apocalyptic world in which many humans have become savages, many have become cannibals, Eli wants to save the sole remaining copy of a sacred text.

The film is full of startling images of a devastated planet. The trappings of civilization are scattered about in shambles. People struggle to survive in a world without law and order. Vicious gangs prey on the weak.

In the midst of it all, Eli is a moral man with a strict code of conduct. He has not descended into barbarism. And, possessing miraculous fighting skills, he will not let anything stand in his way.

Mila Kunis skillfully portrays a young woman who joins Eli's quest. Gary Oldman plays a devilish figure who wants to twist the words of the sacred text so that he can spread evil.

4101880,5,B003A8FET6,"Reminiscent to scenes from The Road, Eli is walking on road with the land around parched and devesatated.  You come to understand that decades before, mankind had decided that destroying himself was the thing to do.  Washington/Eli comes across some bad guys who he dispatches quickly.  He is like a super hero.  There is nothing he can do wrong in fighting these guys who are trying to take what he has.  Yet, this is some very intense violence, some of the more gory violence as well.  There are some off scene but mostly quick hitting in your face type violence.  There are yet more of this to come.

But the story moves a little slowly as he walks toward his ultimate goal.  Moving West.

Washington is very intense in this movie.  Gary Oldman (Carnegie), is an ornery leader of a town where it is like the wild west.  They have water, some food, but not much else.  The decay is endless, and you wonder what town they are in.  Kunis plays a young woman who is basically a subject of Oldman, and she comes into contact with Eli and gets involved in his quest without her complete understanding of what it is.

The movie is very good, yet, since there are times where you see the devastation and he seems to walk somewhat onward, it may have been good as a subplot to have Eli's early life shown as well as that of Carnegie's. Actually in the DVD extra there is a bit on Carnegie as a child and that may have been a good way to do this, injecting it into the scenes without losing the flavor or the moment.

As you know, the book that Eli is carrying is the Bible.  There is a tug here.  The Bible is blamed for the cause of the disaster that has the world as it is.  Yet, it is a book of hope.  One wants it to control others, the other, wants it because he is destined to.

The scenes of the bridges and towns after the destruction are intense and seem even real.  The ending is a surprise, gives you a wow moment for sure.  I like the Book of Eli and hope that it continues to find success.",1279756800,2,1996,4.20844327176781

In a potential post appoctaliptic world Eli given a mission to carry the last bible to the place that God has ordained encounters events that would take the heart of all people without faith. Eli finaly completes his task having kept the word of God in his heart.

The casting is wonderful and I could not imagine a leading cast both good and evil that better portray what the mission of Eli is.

The photography is just a bit light on contrast for most of the movie but it plays well in a world close to hell.

I have to mention the wonderful job that Mila Kunis did in her role. She plays a young woman who could not know the work of God, and has grown up in a world of the dammed yet she is blessed with love and goodness. Miss Kunis plays this most difficult role very convincingly and with great maturity.",1279756800,,965,4.149732620320855

4101885,5,B003A8FET6,"Pretty cool movie. I grew up with post apocalyptic movies and as a consumer of film since the 80s so I am quite anesthetized to movie violence and was certainly expecting it.

***Mild Spoilers***

Denzel is a man with a mission from on-high. I enjoyed the film, especially the bleak wastelands. There always has to be a highway scene where the hero walks past the all the dead cars and peers in at the skeletons and this movie didn't disappoint.

Denzel's dialogue is spare, but he makes up for it with sheer presence. He's still looking pretty delicious too--more so--now that he is older.

The fighting scenes were notable for not being over-the-top or over-long. Denzel's technique could best be described as: 'efficient'. Which is a plus for long-time movie fight watchers who are bitterly all too used to slowed frames, repeated impact glory shots and other martial art cheese that would not begin to transmit what a totally abrupt and brutal thing fighting can be--especially with weapons involved. But Eli is like a paladin on a quest who is clothed, shielded and armed in holy wrath. And so, he does not hesitate or play around when it comes to dispatching people but simply handles it--and keeps on walking.

Portions of the ending were cleverly concealed and there is a moment of 'enlightenment', details of which I shall not go into. Recommended addition to any post apocalypse or Denzel movie collector.",1279584000,2,1415,4.854771784232365

To get to the really good action scenes, you have to sit through boring and somewhat uninteresting characters. The first word isn't spoken into about 6 minutes into the movie. I really didn't find myself that interesting in Eli (Denzel Washington's). He is simply nothing more then a man (with a stonecold personality) who found a king james bible and wants to take it somewhere. Other then that their is nothing interesting about him. He has no past basically, The movie tries do damage control in the later half and we learn more about Eli, but it was a little to late for me. Gary Coleman is a little better in his role as a mad tyrant who believes in the old philosophy that he who holds religion, holds power. Which btw, the movie refers to the bible as ""the book"" for a good portion of the film but it's pretty obvious after awhile that it's a bible he is carrying. Anyone knowing at least some religious history could figure it out from the get go. So i have no idea why they keep calling it ""the book""

4101891,4,B003A8FET6,"""The Book of Eli"" is one of those mini-epics where the hero is regaled for his relentless quest to achieve one compelling aim in life.  Denzel Washington gives a great portrayal of Eli who is consumed with verbally recreating the last Holy Bible in the world into book form.  Denzel's mastery of martial arts and firearms comes off a bit uncoordinated, but you can appreciate and give dramatic license to the attempt.  ""The Book of Eli"" is reminiscent of ""V for Vendetta"" where the hero commits his life to destroying the tyranny of England, which has become a world power--once again.  The similarities are uncanny---the doting young woman who comes to worship the hero for his courage, consolidated power in the hands of one man, and a legacy reborn following the triumph and death of the hero.

The ending of ""The Book of Eli"" did not have the grand finale of ""V,"" because it attempts to turn the disciple into a post hero---which is not a good idea.  Great heroes emerge from conditions average individuals take for granted. There is a level of sensitivity endemic in an individual who longs for and finds a life's calling, which is not easily transferable, no matter how inspirational.  The gift of remembrance and a commitment to excellence is the purist and most authentic homage one can give to the hero.  Hollywood, in all its glory, loves to tantalize audiences with the possibility of a series of characters who become ""Eli.""  If everyone could become Eli, where is the specialness?

I recommend watching ""The Book of Eli"" and ""V for Vendetta"" to embrace and celebrate the possibilities of the human spirit.

4101893,4,B003A8FET6,"Walking into The Book of Eli, I didn't really know what to expect aside from the fact that it's set in a depressing post-apocalyptic wasteland, and it features Denzel wielding a big knife and doing cool things with it. If that's all the movie had been, I probably would have been more or less entertained by it. But no, the movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, and for a movie about a book, it's a pretty solid film.

What stuck me most about this film is probably the unique direction and world-building the film does. It's never really told what caused this apocalypse, but this post-apocalyptic world is kind of a beautiful world. The color has a very distinct tone to it, and even though the film mostly takes place in the California desert, the landscape seems very alive and striking. Watching Denzel just walk in front of a broken interstate towering above him is just a cool visual. And since the world is set 30 years after the apocalypse, everything looks it. Roads have a cracked, but dry quality. Cars are rusted, the paint on houses are peeling, and door hinges easily give way. Also, the world, at least as it shows, show society as reverted back to Western times. It's not really overt, but there's certainly the distinct feel of it in the scenes of the town. In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that they didn't go deeper into the world. I want to know what it was like before. What was Denzel like before all this happened. Was he in the condition that he was in before it happened? You can see a K-Mart name tag with Eli's name on it at one point, but other than that, the movie is very specific in its scope. I just loved what they did with it so much, I wanted to see more of it.

Also, I've never see The Hughes Brothers at work before, but they have a great visual style. And it's not just the color either. It's the shadows, how they light the fight sequences, the camera angles, what you can hear, when you can hear it, and how it's emphasized. I usually don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think. Certainly, all the crew have promise, and I hope to see great things from them in the future. This includes a special shoutout to screenwriter Gary Whitta, who has never done a movie before this, but comes out with a splendid script for his first effort.

But that isn't to say the movie is perfect. I could predict about 75% of the plot fairly easily, and I didn't have much love/use for Mila Kunis until she started blowing crap up. Still, by the end of the movie, they had convinced me that Meg Griffin could in fact be a believable bad-ass. There I said it. I thought it was impossible, but Eli showed me otherwise. Speaking of which...

Denzel really is one of the, if not the highlight of the movie as the mysterious, but still thoroughly bad-ass Eli, who has a penchant for cutting off heads with a very sharp blade in the shadows. But it's not just the blade, as Eli is also impressive with a gun. Denzel pulls all the aspects of the character off with ease and coolness, while still being wise as all get out. Also, Gary Oldman is back in full form, channeling the slimy villainy he ruled over in the 90s. The character is a bit too serious, but Oldman makes the best out of the character.

And then there's the end. A lot of people won't like it, but I like how it isn't the typical ending you'd expect from a movie like this. Is it believable? It's certainly a leap, but it works for Denzel's character, and makes him an even greater character. Plus, everything is wrapped up pretty nice, so I'll give it that too.

Overall, atheists beware, this is a well-done movie that shows promise for everybody involved creatively. It also shows that Denzel is not without hope, Gary Oldman can still be slimy, and Mila Kunis can actually be cool. It's a surprisingly good movie and a satisfying one at that.",1279411200,2,3932,4.394230769230769

Things plod along, and towards the end, Eli is forced to part with the book.  He reaches his destination without the book and then, you will never, never guess what happens, unless you saw Farenheidt 451, maybe 40 years ago.  So things really rest with Denzel, who as usual, is very good and how much you want to read into all this.  I suppose it could be very inspirational if you can avoid getting bogged down by having seen it all before.  Then again, maybe that's what the book is trying to say.

If you look at the ratings for this movie currently they are 50% for 5 Stars and rest are evenly spread out over 1 - 4 stars.  That says something.  This movie makes you think and not just sit on your couch.  There are some people that get the complete story and there are some that don't.  If you get it you apparently are one of us with Faith (Eli, Solara, Claudia and possibly Redridge) and if you don't get it maybe your without Faith (Carnegie, etc).  You're blind to what gives this movie substance.  I would have like to seen this movie have a few more action scenes or more drama at times.  But the pacing fits the landscape the story is set in (sparse and desolate).

Guro Dan Inosanto and Jeff Imada did a great job on the fight sequences and training Denzel for his role.

*** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS ***

If you have not seen the movie then stop reading RIGHT NOW.  The two big surprises in the movie are the book itself and the fact that Eli is a blind man.  I have seen some on the internet state that the book was saved to just sit on a shelf.  That his quest was a waste.  If you look clearly at the scenes of the printing press you notice they are printing multiple versions of each page.  They are printing multiple copies so THE WORD can be spread.

Looking at the movie a 2nd time take his blindness this way.  Eli was blind before his quest and when he arrived at his destination.  When Eli takes on his quest from GOD he is given sight so he can complete his task.  Proof of his ""sight by Faith"" would be the fact that he maneuvers in an environment without any issues.  That his eyes focus when he is talking to people.  Only on a few scenes does he use his hands to sense his environment.  In the making-of documentary on the disk the writer states that Eli is not a former soldier.  He is just someone who developed these skills to fight along the way.  A blind man would not train himself raise his pistol or shotgun to aim.  He would not be able to take out a sniper over 100 feet away on different elevation from behind him based on sound.  He would not be accurate with a bow and arrow without his sight.  He would not know the house was off to the side of the road and stay the night unless he had sight.

When GOD gave him his mission Eli received GOD'S protection.  Proof of his protection would be Eli being shot at by Redridge in the town twice and not being hit both times.  The third time Redridge should have shot Eli, Redridge just puts his gun down and doesn't even try.  Also surviving in such a world for 30 years is yet more proof.  I would say that the only time Eli did not have his protection or sight would be when Carnegie shoots him.  GOD wanted him to give over the book and possibly test Eli at the same time.",1279152000,,3088,4.164128595600677

When he finally joins in the hunt he finally obtains it, but sometimes even a well read person can not read what's coming in the way of God's ironic retribution. My only objection to the movie is Washington kills a cat with the same lack of remorse that he dispatches the vultures of society.

4101914,4,B003A8FET6,"Well, after watching two equally great movies about a post-apocalyptic world one thing is for sure: life on Earth will suck after the apocalypse. Whether we ultimately nuke ourselves to oblivion or some stray asteroid does the job instead, both of the writers for The Book of Eli and The Road see a dystopian world full of cannibals and little hope. I hope that we never truly experience it, but, man, these two movies were cool!

Of the two movies I think that I liked Eli a little bit more, which is reflective of my affinity for violent, graphic novel-esque movies. And indeed, The Book of Eli seemed to be exactly that...a graphic novel come to life about a rogue nomad determined to transport a special book west across a bleak and dangerous landscape. But Eli (Denzil Washington) is prepared to make the transfer...well prepared. Yes, there is unrest in the forest and Eli will keep it all equal with hatchet, ax and saw. And are higher forces at work helping to guide Eli along?

Then there's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/B001FB563E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>. This time the traveler is a man (Viggo Mortensen) also heading off in search of a safe haven. This man believes that the safe haven is south, and like Eli, he also has some cargo with him that he intends to protect and deliver safely at all costs...that cargo being his son. The land that Mortensen & son attempt to cross is in the same condition and full of the same dangers that I mentioned that Eli was dealing with. The Road is a lot lighter on the violence than Eli and more about a father trying to lead his son down a path of righteousness, while at the same time maintaining self-preservation as numero uno.

I'd almost suggest that the two stories could be tied together and happening simultaneously in a United States devastated by catastrophe. Although, in Eli the apocalypse is explained as the result of nuclear war and bright sunlight burning the planet up due to resulting damage to the ozone layer; and I don't recall an explanation in The Road, but I think that we're supposed to gather that it was from a giant asteroid or something that created a world where a dust cloud permanently obscures the sun. Either way it's a living doomsday.

Both movies feature a host of A-list actors, and even the actors that aren't as well known give A-list performances. Action. Thrills. Emotion.

Anyone with eyes and a mind can see that our society will revel in even the worst garbage. Blindly this was ordered and from the cat being wantonly killed and barbequed and fed to a rat is when I SHOULD have stopped but this masterpiece of manure was continued only because Denzel Washington (in my mind) would in a while bring something positive.
When my morning coffee started to come back up, the movie was put up for sale on Amazon. Shame on me for thinking that anything Washington was in would have to be redeemable.

the direction was sharp (The Hughes Brothers have proven
themselves to be capable and astute directors who show
amazing range and diversity at directing various film genres).
Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and all of the supporting cast
turned in solid believable performances, there was lots
of action, brutal fight sequences, explosions, there are
even some comical moments. There's also a revelation
towards the end which will take you by surprise if
you weren't paying attention throughout the film.
I didn't go into this movie with any lofty expectations,
or comparing it to other post-apocalyptic fare, I just
took it for what it was worth and I was entertained.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good
story, good acting, action, and ultimately, entertainment.

4101922,2,B003A8FET6,"'The Book of Eli' has a promising start. We meet Denzel Washington as  Eli walking a post-apocalyse wasteland 30 years in the future very much like the depiction in 'The Road'. He is walking carrying a book that we immediate recognize as the Bible. In case we missed the close-up of the hasped leather bound volume, Denzel gives us plenty of biblical references and quotations.

The viewer's suspension of disbelief is  somewhat challenged from the start. Denzel sports shades, odd considering that the planet is shown overcast, grey, dead, and dark. He even wears his sunglasses in dark interior scenes. And unlike Viggo Mortensen in The Road, who literary starved himself to portray the almost dead,skeletal man, Denzel looks pretty good for surviving 30 years of the end of the world. In fact all the characters, except for a couple of cannibals he meets towards the film's last third, look pretty good. If the sunglasses don't amuse you, consider that Denzel also listens to an iPod as he wanders. Not a current iPod but the original iPod. Wow! What a machine to last perhaps 40 years. Steve Jobs needs to use that clip in Apple's advertising.

It gets worse. Sunglasses seem to be a readily available commodity in this destroyed future. Everybody has a pair. Yet, the book that has had millions upon millions of copies printed around the world, the Bible, is not to be found except in the hands of Eli. Suspension of disbelief becomes impossible after a while. Perhaps you can rationalize the availability of ammo and gasoline  after 30 years, even mascara and eye shadow, but how do you rationalize that the roadbed still has painted white lines on them? And worse, the entire film after the first 20 minutes, and the exception of the very end of the film, is shot through a brown sepia-tone filter. At least in 'The Road', the Director of Photography found believable realistic looking desolation.

Denzels' acting is wooden and uninspired. Luckily, the rest of the cast is quite good, especially Gary Oldman, who carries this film. I wondered if Denzel's acting style in this film was copied from Clint Eastwood's 'Pale Rider'. Often, we the viewers, are just not sure if Eli is truly human. His fighting abilities and accuracy with a pistol at long distances are surely supernatural. Bullets bounce of him, at least in one fight scene, and when he he shot point blank by Oldman, we see a flash of lightning in the sky. Is Eli supposed to be a ghost? Jesus? We are not even sure if he can see or if he is blind.

'The Book of Eli' is a well produced film that lifts ideas from other films such as 'The Road', 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome', and 'Fahrenheit 451'. But it ultimately fails. The so-called surprise ending was no surprise at all if you were paying attention. The climax was telegraphed half-way into the movie if you could not guess it from the title itself. And without revealing the ending here, anyone who has worked with the kind of book revealed at the end knows how lame it is to  suggest that the book carried by Eli is the entire King James Bible.

UPDATE OF SORTS -

I have been asked several times what is wrong with the ending of the film. So here I am revealing the ending. This is a SPOILER. Do not read any further if you don't want to know the answer

Violent certainly, one I would use good judgment around the kiddos. Wonderful music. Great acting. And a story line that seems to be a complete original outside the post apocalyptic idea. Seems several of the reviewers like to point out that God wouldn't sanction killing. Uhmmm yeah he would. You don't have to look far to see direct commands to do such things in the bible. But as usual it has become popular to christian bash in this day and age. Getting away with bigotry without all the hassle of being called a racist. Those that understand even some scripture will pick up a few key things along the way. 1. The living word will endure. This is the main focal point of the story line. 2. God will use many vessels to see his will done. Those of peace and even those of death are his. This supports the overarching storyline.

4101926,2,B003A8FET6,"The movie opens with Denzel killing a cat for dinner in this post apocalyptic odyssey that left me feeling like I wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never get back, by watching this waste of time.

I was really not knowing what to think as I started watching this movie, then Denzel comes across a women by a cart and knows something is wrong. He can smell the band of thugs waiting for him. Denzel starts kicking ass as a band of idiots try to take his pack. He quickly, too quickly in fact, takes his knife and chops off the man's hand. It was life he moved faster than humanly possible.

He kills all of them except for the woman who was there to set him up. He keeps walking and ends up in this town that is run by Gary Oldman's character. He's in charge of the town and has a blind women and her grown daughter who he keeps as his property.

Denzel goes into the bar to get some water and pisses off one of the guys in the bar by shooing away this nasty white cat. Denzel again ends up killing just about everyone who tries to stop him from leaving the bar, which is a whole handful of people.

Gary Oldman's character is sending his thugs out to look for a specific book that we later find out Denzel's Character, Eli has. We don't find out that the book is actually the bible until about half way through the movie.

Eli makes it to where he says a voice told him to go. Are we to believe that the voice of god told him to keep going west for 30 years? He's been walking for 30 years before he finally makes it to the island of Alcatraz and finds people that are starting over by using a press to make books and keeping treasures like paintings and such things.

The bible Eli has is given to Gary Oldman's character after Eli is shot by him. But when he gets back and gets the lock undone, he finds the bible is in brail and his girl that is blind won't read it for him.

Eli has memorized the entire bible and tells a man what it said as he writes it down and then Eli does.

The other thing about this movie that made no sense what so ever was everyone made everyone else they came in contact with shows their hands didn't shake. because if your hands shook, it meant you were eating human flesh, but that storyline was never really given much thought and it was never explained.

This movie was a two hour snore fest that left me feeling dirty because of the self righteous religious aspects being forced down my throat.

All in all, this movie was a waste of time and I would give it less than one star if I could. Don't waste your time, pick something else to watch.",1278374400,12,2582,4.10515873015873

Worth more than one viewing for sure.

  Dont be thrown off my people who rate this film poorly due to religious views (obnoxious). If the book was hiding the secrets to an alien race of cyborg soldiers, nobody would complain.

4101928,1,B003A8FET6,"This is Hollywood at its absolute worst: a violent disgusting movie that only caters to the lowest human instincts, i.e. just perfect for bible-carrying gun-loving fundamentalist zealots in the pre-apocalypse.

The story can be written on the back of a stamp but that doesn't make it more believable: Lone heavily armed hero on a mission from God leaves a trail of bodies behind on his 30 year trek from east to west coast of former USA through the usual stereotypical post-apocalyptic landscape; you know, bleak colours, radioactive decay, strong sun, nasty people.

You just have to love the Christian dead cult for giving us this wonderful world view: When society collapses everybody reverts to creatures worse than animals. Murder, rape, exploitation and cannibalism are the favoured human interactions. Yeah, right.

But with God in your ark, you'll be good? Eh, no, our hero is the worst killer of them all.

The violence is nasty and explicit. The hero literally dismembers and murders anyone who lays a hand on him. This may work in a video game, but this friggen a is supposed to be a role model on a mission from god to protect the last remaining bible in the world. He even knows it by heart - but it sure as hell hasn't touched his.

So why this movie? A statement that it is ok to kill to for your religion? Possibly directed at the ""brave Christian warriors"" overseas? Who knows and who cares. Zero stars.

It is worth seeing one time, for the twist at the end and for the specials effects and storyline, but just like the movie Sixth Sense, in which when you see the astonishing ending, you actually lose any interest in seeing the movie again [because you will then know why the actor does everything he does].  Thus, in the Book of Eli, the ending is astonishing and spoils any desire to see the movie again.  My reason for giving it a ""one"" rating is because the movie concludes with a defense of terrorists teachings.  You will see many killings [see previews] throughout the movie which is actually justified because it is always done in self defense.  But, I was very disappointed with the ending because here was an opportunity, though a fantasy, to reduce considerably the teaching of terrorism and direct hatred towards certain religions from a god or God.  Instead, the movie equates all major religions as being peaceful and necessary - a fallacy.  If you compare the religions today [please don't build straw men by citing offenses over 100 years old] and see the movie, you too will see the stupidity of the ending and why some of us were left with an empty feeling.  The only reason for the fowl promotion is that the white man at the end of the movie must be a liberal [in keeping with Hollywood standards].",1278288000,4,1382,4.566801619433198

4101936,5,B003A8FET6,"I am a Washington fan as well as Oldman. While I felt Denzel was maybe a little less powerful in his role than usual, I know Gary Oldman was wasted as the balancing evil to Denzel's good. Both actors appeared to be lukewarm in their roles. Oldman can usually be a bad guy without any stretching but his role here was unfocused and his power over others was never defined. No clear goals. Without understanding why he had followers, it's hard to take him seriously. He had an increasing air of impotence that eventually had his world destroying itself around him in the end. There was never a clear idea of his power to start with so there is no sense of his loss.

 Denzel Washington is very talented when he is channeling the character's emotions and personality. Sadly, Eli had little personality. A bit too introverted and was so focused on the westward trek that he failed to let us into his mind. While Oldman's character targets Eli and fixates on mugging him for his King James Bible, Eli never really channels anything except selective, random compassion or grim determination.

 I like the movie. I like how the Bible was critical to this world's survival. I liked the action plus the sets and lighting. I never lost interest and if my mind wandered, it was on the plot trying to fill in blanks. I have heard a lot of people whine about the killing of the cat. Foolishness.

Despite the incomplete story and those not exciting action scenes, the two main characters (Washington and Oldman) are outstanding. Pardon me that I cant find anything else worth mentioning, except the killing of the cat in the beginning which I cant find any relationship of it with the main story or anything about the character of Washington/Eli at all.

4101938,5,B003A8FET6,"An epic masterpiece with a grand performance by Denzel Washington as Eli, a self proclaimed prophet, traveling West to his unknown destiny. The wastelands of post apocalypse America are filmed in New Mexico...direction, cinematography, costumes, plot, script and casting all top notch.

Eli's 30 years of walking encompass spiritual awakening and enlightenment for the viewer and many of those who cross his path (those who survive, anyhow). The plot centers around delivering a rare ""book of faith"" to an unknown place...mystery, drama, action and sci-fi horror abounding. Washington really extends his notable talent to portray a multifaceted character...a pariah, an enigma, a saint, a survivor with lightning fast reflexes, and yes, someone who eats what is necessary to survive, even a cat. Realism involves distasteful scenes, but it never fails to fascinate me on how callous we become to the suffering of humans...and yet, our horror and outrage cannot be contained if another species is harmed in a scene...reminiscent of watching Mr. Jingles get stomped in the Green Mile...kill all the humans, just don't hurt the animals! Hmmmm...

Great supporting cast of Gary Oldman as the CEO (Carnegie) of the new Wastelands. Mila Kunis (Solara) is terrific as Eli's traveling companion, reluctant protege, and the movie's visual delight. Those cool layered post apocalyptic clothes might catch on! Another memorable character is Jennifer Beals (who plays Claudia, Solara's mother and Carnegie's blind concubine). Beals emotes a surprising and welcome acting range, in having little choice in being a companion to an evil villain.

The only real saving grace here is Oldman, enjoyably quirky as usual. But Kunis is ridiculous, barely an actress but real good at waltzing around post-apocalypse with her perfectly coiffed LA salon hairdo flowing in the breeze. Give me a break.

Washington is solid as ever, no complaints there, but he really just doesn't have much to work with here in terms of script. The occasional sword and gunfight, a few long walks down the scorched road, a cannibal here and there, it's all good. Or not. And I hate movies that feature rape scenes or even threats of them, just to justify yet another revenge killing. So easy and so manipulative, and such lazy film making. The biblical overtones are barely explored, and poorly when they are. It's all a bunch of gobbledygook in the end and only Oldman made it worth watching for me after about 45 minutes.

And what's up with the dynamic range on blu-rays and dvds lately? You can barely hear the dialogue and then suddenly BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! Huge gunshots or whatever crush your eardrums and you're grasping for the remote to save your brain when suddenly you can barely hear everyone talking again. I don't want to ride shotgun on the remote the whole movie. Use a limiter and do us a favor, or at least have a track with optional compression, because we're hearing too many guns and not enough words lately.

All in all, not bad, but hardly fabulous, and when compared to its much worthier apocalyptic brethren, especially The Road Warrior (which has a perfect blu-ray transfer and looks better than this over-filtered sepia mess despite being made three decades earlier), Eli is merely a footnote.",1277424000,6,1820,4.735015772870662
4101947,5,B003A8FET6,"To say that 'The Book of Eli' is a complex film would be somewhat of an understatement. But surprisingly enough, the complexity of the film stems from its simplicity when dealing with the subject matter.

The world has been torn apart. The sky has been burned and the earth has been scorched. All true traces of civilization seem nonexistant. Survival is the only law left. Yet, admist it all, a nameless wanderer (we don't actually figure out the character's name until much later in the film) travels west. He is soft-spoken, yet intensely determined, and from the very beginning of the film you can sense an uncompromising nature about him. Tenderness lined with a hard edge.

Denzel does an amazing job portraying Eli. He's very believable in everything he does. Also, I'd like to give Mr. Washington an extra nod for doing his own stunts. As far as I could tell, every action sequence that took place was one hundred percent Denzel, which makes what he does just that much richer.

Gary Oldman gives a fine performance as well. I genuinely disliked every scene with Carnegie, but not because of Oldman's acting, but because of the character. A slimy, silver-tongued warlord that's used to forcing people to do what he wants. So naturally, every scene in which Eli and Carnegie are at odds, is like watching a battle of iron-hard wills.

I will admit that I found the early scenes with Mila Kunis a bit lacking, but as the story unfolded, I found my interest in her character, Solara, growing and by the end I think Mila gave a full and well-rounded performance.

Not being quite as experienced with some of the films of a later era (mainly the eighties), this was the first time I had witnessed Jennifer Beals in action. And I have to say, I liked her in this film. I've always had an interest with blind characters and I think she portrayed it well.

I also found Ray Stevenson's character interesting as well. He came off to me as a hard man just trying to get by, and is willing to do anything as long as he's still breathing. It was interesting to see the conflict in his character.

Now, for everyone worried about the blood/violence/profane language. If you're squeamish towards realistic voilence or just would rather not watch it, this may not be a film for you. I can truthfully tell you that the violence isn't the main focus of the film, but rather a means to express both Denzel's and Oldman's characters. But then again, you may not be able to overlook it.

Regarding the profane language: there's a lot of it. If you don't have a TV Guardian or would rather not sit through it, that may become a problem. Now, to be fair, in the context of the movie, Denzel's character Eli never uses profane language. Ever. I think this film does do a good job of portraying how a Christian walking among worldly people may act.

And finally, to the religious overtones. I am going to keep this little area open except for some quick advice to help decide whether or not to see the film. If you are open about religious thoughts, beliefs and practices, then by all means, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't see this film. But if you aren't open, and would rather stay away from such things, then do so here. Most of the film is based around those ideas.

I personally, really enjoyed the film. I think it gave an interesting take on a post-apocalyptic world that I've not seen before and gave a pretty earnest look at just how savage and civil the human race could be.

The Book of Eli: 5/5

One last thing to keep in mind: it's only a film. If you're the type that will get offended easily, just remember that. If a film is enough to shake your beliefs as a Christian, then I would spend less time getting angry with the film and use that energy help you build a stronger spiritual foundation.",1277424000,,3803,4.5196506550218345
4101948,5,B003A8FET6,"I see the movie an allegory to our times and lives, or as a matter a fact that of any time. We don't need a nuclear war to have the end of times. We also are challenged to carry that same book, THE BIBLE throughout the end of our days in the same manner as Eli. To walk in faith but not in sight. Every day we ""battle"" and ""fight"" evil and temptation of sin just as Eli fought his adversaries in the movie. In time, can we also say what Eli said at the end of the movie?

Okay, after this movie there should be no more post-apocalyptic movies. End of the world movies are so worn out and out played.

This movie wasn't perfect (outdated Hollywood brutal violence which could have been depicted in classical ways) but I give it 5 stars for going where others fear or won't.",1277337600,,772,4.105960264900662

It brings to light various things in this vein. It is a film that requires your complete attention otherwise the ending as one critic states may not register.  I plan on viewing it again to see If I can pick up any things I may have missed during the first viewing. There will be widely different feelings on this film.

Everything is taken place in this post - apocalyptic world with DENZEL as the main character, ELI.  The actors were chosen carefully, it seemed because the actors just dived into these charaters personalities!! It reminded me of the book ""Farenhiet 451"", by Ray Bradbury. Of how books were outlawed and burned and everything was organized by color and numbers. What an awesome movie from beginning to end. It just showed how human beings can become animals and power hungry when something goes out of whack! The plot was that this one book - turning out to be the Bible - is what this fiend is looking for. His reasoning was that this could be used as a weapon - IS a weapon. Of course, you will have to watch the movie to understand why that is. GREAT MOVIE, GREAT ACTING, WONDERFUL STORY LINE/PLOT. OH AND THE ENDING WAS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.

Now, this is more that the circumference of the earth at the equator (which is 24901 miles). In other words, walking only one hour per day he will go around earth at least once considering him being able to walk on water. This is not the only mistake in this movie. For example, what happened to the water? Those clouds behind Denzel are not made out of water? You would think if there are clouds there is water and rain!

Along this treacherous path he encounters hijackers, cannibals and a Warlord named Carnegie (Oldman). The book, Carnegie believes is a weapon that strikes at the heart of man. It will give him the words he needs to control them and expand his power. Eli will stop at nothing to protect the book and bring it to where man still has hope! The forces of good and evil clash again over the oldest story ever told.

The story is effective and the acting is great. Washington is so believable in his roles, which is only further complimented by Oldman. Suprisingly Kunis does a good job as Solara! The story is fluid and poignant. I was interested from start to finish. I strongly recommend a viewing.

Like The Road, an unexplained nuclear holocaust has wiped out civilization, mentioned only in passing. Once again, our hero must get from point A to point B, traveling a road fraught with difficulties and dangers. And he must do it on foot.

Denzel is Eli, a loner and tough-as-nails survivalist tasked with delivering the last remaining x to a safe location. In Children of Men, it was the world's last pregnant woman. In Book of Eli, it's the last remaining copy of the King James Bible. He has been walking for thirty years. The film opens with a very cool sequence of Eli in the forest stalking a feral cat with a bow and arrow, instantly establishing his resourcefulness, marksmanship, and super-badness for the audience. Visually, it just looks fabulous the way the scene is designed and filmed in monochromatic cyan with detritus raining down. Eli speaks softly and carries a big knife. In fact, it's a very, very big knife and he makes expert use of it against the roving gangs of thieves and cut-throats he encounters, hacking off hands and limbs with style.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wesley-Snipes/dp/B002HFWAYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wesley Snipes</a>&nbsp;would be proud.

The real trouble for Eli (and this film's story) begins when he stops off for supplies at a ramshackle town run by a ruthless man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman), who had been sending out search parties to scour the wasteland for the book. While Eli is a man of faith and cherishes the book as the key to humanity's salvation, Carnegie covets it for a very different reason: to control the masses and expand his influence to other towns. He tries to make a deal and Eli refuses. At this point, Eli is no longer a loner dependent on his wits and reflexes for survival. He picks up extra baggage in the form of an attractive, but altogether annoying and poorly-developed side-kick character (Mila Kunis) who he now has to protect. This is where the script gets sloppy. Instead of being a story of the cool, quiet, and self-reliant stranger who only has himself to look after, it now becomes the story of ""save the helpless girl from the bad-guys"" and running away from the gangsters.

I enjoyed seeing details of Eli's survival techniques the most and how he copes with the dangers of the wasteland, but not enough of his back-story is given. That itself isn't the problem, because I'm plenty willing to enjoy a character's unexplained and mystery past and live in the here and now of his present situation, like Clint Eastwood's archetypal loner, the ""Man with No Name"" from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-with-No-Name-Trilogy-A-Fistful-of-Dollars-For-A-Few-Dollars-More-The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/0792842502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)</a>. The real problem is the irritating tag-along Eli picks up, which for me, ruins the story. Gary Oldman, an actor I respect and admire, underwhelms here. He has played plenty of excellent villains before (Agent Stansfield in Leon, Zorg in Fifth Element), but his portrayal here is lackluster, devoid of quirks, and mostly uninteresting. Also worth mentioning is the wasted potential of Ray Stevenson as Carnegie's lead henchman. He has no memorable lines or scenes and dies in a cheap and inglorious manner.

The final segment of the journey is very similar to Children of Men, though I did not mind because what happens after he gets to his destination was a pleasant twist. The very ending quite obviously hints at a sequel possibility with someone taking up Eli's mantle.

Unlike some viewers, I did not take this film to be a celebration of religion or a condemnation of it. The Bible is arguable the most important book in western civilization and a natural choice for a film's central plot device. The Book of Eli is not perfect, but it's worth a look if you liked any of the films I mentioned above.",1276992000,,5115,5.9727148703956345

It touched me on such an emotional level that I knew that I would need to purchase it as soon as it became available...which for me is highly unusual. I've long been a Denzel Washington fan, and now consider this to be his finest performance ever. Mila Kunis was excellent as well. I've read some of the other reviews for this film and it would seem that many of the reviewers are bending over backward to declare that the movie is not ""religious"". Well, in my opinion, it was very spiritual and was basically about the power of God in directing His servant to adhere to His Will through many extreme difficulties over a period of 30+ years in order to eventually accomplish the goal that God had intended. The movie begins in the final trial of Eli's journey and we are allowed to observe the constancy of Eli's ""walk by faith, not by sight"".

4101966,4,B003A8FET6,"Here, again, is another Denzel Washington movie that will have you thinking about it long after the viewing is done.  Denzel puts in a strong performance as the movie's lead, a character that echoes back to the ""man with no name"" type of hero made famous by Clint Eastwood.  Here in a post-apocalyptic world where the death of a feral cat mirrors the manner in which the survivors of nuclear devastation treat each other, the audience is immersed in a cold, stark world that is both repulsive and fascinating.  I couldn't stop watching the screen.  The bleached colors of the film serve to enhance the bleak nature of this new environment and the fantastic, often haunting, musical score truly adds to the eerie atmosphere.

Gary Oldman, Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Mila Kunis are well cast and demand your attention in their roles.  We also get some exciting action sequences, particularly the showdown that takes place at the home of a very eccentric couple (also well-played).  Thought-provoking, spiritual, frightening, and reflective, THE BOOK OF ELI is all these things and the movie is well worth the price of admission.

Denzel Washington is good, but the plot and the dialogue were so heavy handed, the overall effect was insulting. As well, the idea that this man can kill others in the name of defending religion (a book nonetheless) is a little disturbing, but certainly not new.

4101969,3,B003A8FET6,"I really did want to like this movie, and there were aspects of it that were entertaining, but overall I found it to be a disappointment.  Denzel Washington as always was very good, but the rest of the cast came up a little short.  For the record I think Mila Kunis is absolutely gorgeous but as far as an end of the world warrior in training, I just don't see it.  Gary Oldman was just a disappointment.  I couldn't see him convincing me in this role at all.  I think he was going for a Dennis Hopper persona but there is, or was, only one Dennis Hopper.

The movie begins with 10 minutes or so of Denzel in isolation making his way across the country.  All we really find out is he is going west, he loves his IPod and if you attempt to get in his way you will lose a body part of some sort.  He doesn't look for violence but when pressed, he will fight back with a vengeance.  Luckily there aren't many people who get in his way.  The world has been destroyed and much of the population wiped out.  It appears to be from a nuclear war but in reality the cause and effect is never completely explained.

Denzel finds his way to a local city and at that point we discover Gary Oldman and his gang of bike riding goons, who are all looking for a book.  It is a special book and all we know is that it can be used as a weapon.  It was easy for me to read what was happening at that point, the hints were pretty blatant, but I will not give the secret away for those of you who might not pick up on what direction the movie was heading.  Denzel happens to posses the book and won't give it up.  He actually kills anyone who tries to take it, and in-between the violent melees he meets Mila Kunis.

The second big surprise, which affects Denzel, becomes pretty evident as well.  I hate it when  movie gives too many clues.  Again, I won't give it away, but the dude can smell anything and everything within a mile of where he stands.  What kind of guy has a better sense of smell than my dog?  Pretty damn impressive.  No wonder he wasn't jumping all over Mila Kunis.  If anyone, even in a post nuclear meltdown met that woman, they would be all over her.  Denzel stays true to his calling and other than killing numerous people, he in the end delivers on his preordained mystical directive.

I think if I was sitting in my house, survived nuclear destruction and some voice called me from the inner recesses of my brain telling me to pick a book and take it west; I would have a glass of scotch and call it a day.  That is probably why I will never be in the movies I guess.

Overall the movie had some decent action scenes, Denzel as always was brilliant but the plot and supporting actors fell short in my opinion.  There just wasn't a lot of depth here.  Bring me back to the Mad Max days and Mel Gibson.  Now that was an awesome movie surrounding worldwide destruction",1276905600,,2870,4.17304189435337

4101971,4,B003A8FET6,"I've seen this twice. This is a solid flick that's entertaining, yet it has a subtle message. Those who enjoy post apocalyptic sci-fi, as well as those who like a deeper message will enjoy this. The movie has its very exciting, action-flick moments, but there's a kind of depth to it also. Those who are open to the spiritual component of this film will be moved. Yet it's done in such a way that those who aren't into it probably won't be bothered by it.

During the second viewing I was able to pick up a lot of the subtleties of the film. They did a great job at creating this ""world"", and I found myself drawn into it. The acting was also top notch.

The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I found parts of it to be kind of slow. In comparison with other movies that I've given 5 stars to, the story was just not quite as riveting. Still, it was really good and worth viewing.

It's rated R because there's some violence in this film, and though some of it's kind of shocking at times, it's not very explicit. There are also a couple of rape scenes where you see the initial violence, but not the act.",1276819200,,1108,4.192488262910798

4101973,5,B003A8FET6,"I'm still ambivelent about this film, ""The Book of Eli"".  Visually, the directors succeed in painting a totally stark, blasted, and scorched-earth wasteland.  ""Life"" has been reduced to a constant struggle for survival - food, water, shelter, and protection.

As the film progresses, you discover bits and pieces of what happened to produce a world like what you are viewing - obviously some kind of nuclear war - but, also you get hints about book burnings - particularly religious writings - which were blamed, by some, as the cause for the war and the resulting devestation.

Enter Eli, who is guarding some kind of book, who believes he has been told ""by a voice"" to take the book west.  Also, we meet Carnegie, a violent, ambitious leader of a large gang that has control of at least one city.  Carnegie is searching for a particular book that he believes will give him control over the masses of people.  We even get a hint that prior to the war, Carnegie was some kind of ""successful"" religious preacher.  We soon discover that the book Eli is guarding is the very one that Carnegie desparately desires.

So, we have two people who both cherish the Book, but for vastly different reasons.  Eli sincerely believe's the Book's message - he attempts to live by it - he wants to spread the book's message to as many people as possible because he believes it contains the Truth and that only by following its teachings will people find true meaning for life and real peace with one's self, Man and God.  Carnegie wants the book to use for his own purposes - to sway and use people in order to achieve power and control.  The Book to him is only a means to get what he wants - he doesn't really believe it's message - he isn't going to live by it's message - he just values it for it's influence over people.

I'm still mulling over the messages of the film, but it does make you think and the story pulls you in.  The film's major theme, I believe, is that although there are ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" mascarading as ""servants"" of God - don't reject the Truth because of the fakes.  Be discerning about who or what you put your faith in.  Truth can be used for good or for evil.

Overall, I think this movie is definitely worth watching - good acting, good pacing, good plot and character development - interesting twist toward the end.  Highly recommend.",1276819200,5,2360,4.525943396226415

4101975,4,B003A8FET6,"There's something about Denzel Washington that makes just about anything he appears in all the cooler.  Take The Book of Eli for example: a post-apocalyptic action vehicle that comes off being better than it rightfully should be thanks to the starpower of Washington, who plays the enigmatic, and dangerous, wanderer Eli.  Eli is westward bound and carrying a precious text that soon becomes coveted by the maniacal Carnegie (Gary Oldman) after Eli sets foot in his town.  It isn't long before Eli and young Solara (Mila Kunis) are on the run, all the while dodging other hazards of the barren wasteland.  While The Book of Eli hardly offers anything new to the post-apocalyptic thriller or action genres, it does feature some gorgeous cinematography and camera work, as well as the most inspired direction to come from The Hughes Brothers since Menace II Society.  The action sequences are violent and surprisingly creative, and Washington manages to be equal parts charasmatic and stoic: he truly makes the film as worthwhile as it is.  Oldman is his usual good villainous self, Kunis is easy on the eyes, and supporting turns from Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Tom Waits round things out nicely.

""The Book of Eli"" was an incredible movie in the sense that it delivers what it sets out to deliver...a tight story with exceptional actors and a quite subversive and bleak atmosphere.  I was faced with a dilemma in viewing this movie that I noticed only one other reviewer picked up on (he gave the movie one star).  If Eli, played very adeptly by Denzel Washington, had wholly memorized the bible, then why wasn't he applying the teachings in the good book to his daily life?  Why did he stand by in ignorance while a woman was brutally raped only yards from where he was hiding, especially if he KNEW that he was protected and untouchable?  It's not like he had to fear for his life.  He knew that God had appointed him as a messenger, and that His hand was covering him.  Protection is one thing, but why go around killing people when the very book you are safekeeping clearly states that murder is unholy and sinful?  Was there no way to talk his way out of those situations?  I'm fairly certain that God would have provided Eli the ""gift of gab"" just as well as he provided him the ability to kill thirty armed and burly men in thirty seconds.  There are more questions along these lines, but why bore you with monotony?

Why five stars then,  you ask?

Simple...this was probably one of the most entertaining movies of the year for me.  Here's why:

1. Mila Kunis has really become quite the actress, and she is most enjoyable to watch, as she is in EVERYTHING she does.  Gary Oldman is perfectly cast and very much in his element, and Denzel Washington is top-notch as the hero in this unlikely role.

2. All the questions in the first paragraph can be explained in only one way...the answer?

THE HUMAN CONDITION

Eli, being human, was so focused on the mission at hand that he missed everything the bible told him as he read it.  The saying goes something like ""Can't see the forest for the trees.""  Doesn't that happen every single day to every single bible-guided person out there?  Freewill breeds sin, and within sin is the human condition to ""Look out for number one"" rather than put others before yourself.  Eli even told Solara that what he had taken away from everything he had read in the bible was to put others before yourself, but yet, just as all of us are prone to do, he didn't necessarily practice what he preached on a day-to-day basis.

So instead of focusing on the position Mr. One-Star review took on the movie, which is thinking that since Eli memorized the bible, he should be perfect, I choose to look at it from the next view AFTER that point-of-view.  Eli could only do the best that he could do with what he was given...for after all, HE WAS ONLY HUMAN.

One more note of interest...HE WAS BLIND!",1276732800,3,2770,4.523138832997988
4101978,5,B003A8FET6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie on many levels. Yes, the spurts of violence seem to clash with the overall message but even that aspect is covered by dialogue and a nicely crafted story. The parallels between Denzel's character and Jesus (again minus the violence) and Mila's character to Mary Magdalene are apparent but handled well in my opinion. A big point off for the premise that apparently led to the apocalyptic times depicted but that grim world does draw you in to the film completely. Taking entertainment to a thoughtful level is always good and this film succeeds at that remarkably well. It points out that it's critical to define what's really important in life. There are no small things, just things we take for granted. (Next time I'm in KFC, I'm going to take a massive handful of wet wipes!) The reverence and reference to the need for faith and what life would be like without it is strong. ""Finish the race, fight the good fight and keep the faith.""",1276646400,,971,4.684210526315789

The Hughes Brothers did an exceptional job with the fight scenes. Oh, and I cannot forget the cinematography - WOW!  The cinematography was simply breathtaking!",1276646400,2,470,5.911764705882353
4101981,1,B003A8FET6,"The moral that both my wife and I took away from this movie is that blind devotion to religious symbols (ie the bible in this case) makes people completely miss the point of said symbols (compassion, kindness to our fellow man etc.).

In this well made, but morally disgusting, movie the main character refrains from helping people, even to the point of allowing a woman in one scene to be raped, in order to carry his precious religious tome to some people with a printing press.  He is so devoted to the physical object, and what it symbolizes, that he completely ignores the message therein.

Further, he wantonly slaughters those who act aggressively toward him, again in the name of his religious zealotry.  What happened to ""turn the other cheek""?  What happened to ""thous shalt not kill""?  Those seem like pretty clear directives to me...but does this character, who supposedly has memorized the entire bible from slavishly reading and rereading it with little to no actual comprehension of it get these simple teachings?  No.  All these teachings conveniently vanish when faced with a threat to his shallow devotion to the symbol.  He even has the nerve to quote scripture AS he's killing.  Unbelievable.

In short, as a depiction of hypocrisy and the dark side of religion, five stars!  As the writer and director inteded it, 0 stars for missing the point.",1276646400,27,1365,4.861471861471862

Denzel Washington gave the best performance of his career with this movie. What's even more interesting is after the big reveal at the end of the movie, if you watch it a second time, you see that he acted the part PERFECTLY and you'll kick yourself for not realizing it earlier.

First and foremost, I am Atheist and I loved this movie. Yes, there are great action/fight scenes, great acting and amazing writing (give credit where credit is due).
Mila Kunis who may not be taken as serious an actor as some may want will make you rethink those thoughts by her performance here.
I haven't been a Denzel fan for a while. This really made me come back to being a fan of his. He really played the part well and made you believe he was on a faith walk to some holy destination.
There is excellent foreshadowing all through the movie (thanks to the excellent writing) that by the end, you will say to yourself, ""That's why he did (or said) that!"".
It is a must-see movie.

4101989,2,B003A8FET6,"Warner Bros. cheated me and everyone else who bought the combo-pack of The Book of Eli by including a 3.35 GB SD DVD in this package.  SD DVDs of first run movies normally run 4.5 to 6.6 GB.  In order to include the digital copy of this movie on the DVD, Warner Bros. technicians reduced the size of the SD DVD movie to a very low 3.35 GB, for a movie with a reduced color palette that needs every bit of video data to look presentable.  The Blu-ray version looks fine, even if it takes forever to load, as you watch a time icon on the screen as the picture boots up.

The SD version includes the digital copy of the movie, something I can do without.  It is near impossible to watch the SD version on your computer, since the disc is programmed to go into the digital copy installation mode first.

With this combo-pack, Warner Bros. makes Walt Disney Blu-ray/DVD packages look good.  Walt Disney does not rip you off by selling you a reduced data DVD, even of it does load up the DVD with tons of coming attractions.  I thought I was getting a bargain, a Blu-ray for $25 that included the $17 SD version of the movie.  If Warner Bros. wants to sell what I consider to be a defective SD DVD, at the least it should state on the package that the enclosed DVD is an altered version not as good as the standalone SD DVD.

If the past is any guide, The Book of Eli's DVD and Blu-ray's prices should be going down in a month or so.  The Amazon price for the Blu-ray of $25 is worth it if you have to have the Blu-ray now.  I consider the SD DVD in this combo-pack a consumer ripoff by Warner Bros.

4101990,4,B003A8FET6,"As the title suggests, I felt this was a very inspiring movie in terms of what faith can bring you. And that's saying a lot coming from me as I am not a religious person (though I do believe in a higher power). However, watching this movie and the sheer dedication that Denzel Washington portrays as Eli really inspired me and it was a brilliant showing of how faith can guide a person to their goals. Denzel turns in an overall great performance in his protrayal of Eli, who is on a mission to carry a book across a post-apocalyptic America. Traveling through barren wastelands and the occassional small town that has formed together, he lets nothing and no one stand in the way of his mission. Unfortunately along his trip he comes across a city where Gary Oldman's character is the self proclaimed leader of the city. Oldman's character is seeking out the book that Eli carries and will stop at nothing to get his hands on it. Gary Oldman turns in another wonderful performance as the villain in this movie and he and Denzel play off each other masterfully. I give a good bit of credit to the Hughes brothers for another excellent movie and superb direction in this film - I have greatly enjoyed all of their movies that I have seen thus far (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents, From Hell and Book of Eli).

Overall this was a great movie with plenty of action for those like hardcore action as well as a moving theme in the faith that Eli displays as he makes his way across the wasteland. My only beef with the home release (and some others have mentioned this) is why the heck do they release a blu-ray/DVD combo pack? They have done this with other movies as well and I just don't get it - I mean if one actually wants the blu-ray because they own a BD player (as I do), why in god's name would one want the DVD as well. Obviously one would choose to watch the movie in the highest quality available to him/her. It's a waste of money that inevitably jacks up the price of the package since it's extra media...maybe not by that much but still, I'd rather pay for just the BD and not have to pay ANY extra for the DVD that I will never watch. Oh well, there's no real use complaining since the movie companies will do what they want to do; but still, I personally think it's dumb. Well, that's all I've got, hope you find it useful and definitely see this movie if you haven't...or even if you have, watch it again.",1276473600,,2420,4.353982300884955

4101992,3,B003A8FET6,"A post-apocalyptic action film with Denzel Washington as the hero and Gary Oldman as the villain, with Mila Kunis along for the requisite femme fatale role, and Tom Waits thrown in for good measure?  THE BOOK OF ELI had all the requirements to be a first-rate film, a stand-out in the genre.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  True, it has an interesting premise: a man (Eli) is traveling across the country, carrying the last remaining Bible (not really a spoiler; you kind of know it long before it's ""revealed"").  Simultaneously, an evil man named Carnegie (groan) is devouring all the books he gets, looking for that one...that holy one.  And when he meets Eli, and finds his book, he wants it.  Oh, he wants it.  The only thing he didn't plan on, though, is how much a** Eli can kick.

I will give the film this much: it never quite drops the bottom out on you.  And the action is stylized; it's nice to see Denzel kicking butt and taking names.  And Oldman shines in an otherwise cliched role.  Mila Kunis should probably stick to comedy (remember MAX PAYNE?  Me neither), and it's kind of unsettling, having her be the sole attractive woman in the world.  The film has its flaws, far too many of them--most of it hinges on the script, which is just pathetic at times.  The overt Christian overtones are surprisingly pleasing; they help the film stand out, even if you're not into that kind of thing (and I'm not).  Overall, ELI is a film to see if you're a fan of the genre.  If you're not, you probably won't like it.  It's not as good as its cast and premise would have you believe, but at least it's better than a lot of what else gets handed off as action films these days.",1276387200,5,1676,4.442622950819672

People become so serious to point out its flaws that their judgement is bias, and one sided. First off. Remember this is a FICTIONAL movie and it carries a twist of religion (that the one star reviews seem to gripe about), the good and the bad, exposistion, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement. Its story covers the basics. Although many people feel queezy about religion like its some sort of big evil repulsive creature, remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and not like one of a 8 year old. This movie is entended to entertain, and it does that. If you have a big freaking problem with religion in general, then skip this movie and quit whining. Otherwise, if you give it a chance, you might actually like this movie.

Although it has this ""religious"" element, The Book of Eli tries to not keep your mind focused on just that fact. It brings together the gritty action, western kind of feel as Denzel is so on point to maintain, that sometimes you forget about the whole religion theme, the bible, and all that stuff people seem to have such a problem with. I do wish there was a little more scenes with Denzel laying the smackdown on a few people. He has a mission that he is determined to carryout before he dies and nobody is going to stop him from reaching it. Not only does it have the action and the violence that mostly everyone enjoys, but you end up kind of getting drawn to Denzels character and feel drawn into to not just him, but gary oldman playing a fine villain who is determined to seize what denzel has and use it for his own greed and his own agenda. Also, it delivers the twist at the end that if you haven't figured out the spoiler from the million other reviews, just makes you go ""wow.""

Seriously just dreadful film. The plot made no sense; the story arc was...non-existent, the pacing was confusing, the characters were derivative & dull, and did I mention the plot was stupid?  We won't even get started on the 10 pages required to recount the plot holes, inconsistencies, and illogical motivations.

This is the type of movie that you would expect to see boom mics in the shot and 20 year old CGI technology effects...BUT the production value is top quality in this farce of a story.

The final irony is you would expect a stronger pro or con reaction giving the religious nature of the story but even that aspect of this drama is seeping with a dull malaise.

Some people have pointed out that there is some heavy-handed religious grandstanding going on in this movie. I won't deny that there is definitely a religious undertone, but it's actually not an overt 'religion is great' message. Eli starts out on the road intent on his path. He's on a mission, he's got a message, he's going to get to his goal, and to hell with who he cuts down or stomps on to do so. Considering he's carrying the Bible, there are pretty obvious real life parallels. Look at today's right wing Christians (note, not all are right wing!) in their fight against homosexuality or abortion. They are right and moral and have a message, dammit! Who cares what PEOPLE are crushed in the process, right? But through the course of the movie, Eli starts to understand that getting to the goal isn't the test, it's how he does it.

MENACE II SOCIETY had moments of flair and style, but ultimately was not a good film. DEAD PRESIDENTS is one of the most needlessly violent films I've ever seen, and while I appreciate the point it's trying to make, it doesn't make it well. FROM HELL... well, being a comic fan and a devotee of Alan Moore, this film was simply god-awful. And then I saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF ELI, and I thought to myself... COOL! Denzel as a post-apocalyptic wasteland Zatoichi-esque wanderer and Gary Oldman as his nemesis. That seems like the recipe for a really kick-butt film. But... no. They manage to take a really interesting premise and make it convoluted, cliched, inanimate and ultimately dull. The problems that the two stars of the film face the most is that they've played these roles before, and they've played them better. Denzel did the FAR superior MAN ON FIRE and Gary did the FAR superior LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL.

What also upsets me is the way that not just this film, but every film that the great Ray Stevenson seems to be in, his talent is just wasted.

The film operates under a similar pretense to another superior film, Kurt Wimmer's EQUILIBRIUM, that certain abstract things (in this case, certain 'books') cause death, destruction and war. And what has caused more death and destruction throughout history than religion? Again, if you've read anything on the description of this film, you know that the book Denzel is carrying with him is the last-known copy of the King James bible. And apparently, this bible is giving him a supernatural ability to resist harm and kick serious tail. Denzel's dialogue consists mainly of how he's ""being led by faith"" or ""being guided by God""... old hat. Gary goes for the quiet insane that has bursts of rage and violence. Old hat. The desolate post-nuclear wastes are shot with highly bleached colors. OLD... HAT. How this film becomes even worse is that Denzel gets a kid sidekick. Well, it's twenty-something hottie Mila Kunis, but she has the emotional range of a twelve-year old, so for all intents and purposes, she's a kid sidekick.

And the film, near the end, has an O.Henry-like twist that is so incredibly stupid that I had trouble believing that they included it.

Ever wonder what a religious post apocalyptic western would look like? If you have, then The Book of Eli is it. If you haven't - see it anyway. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

The sensational Denzel Washington stars as Eli. He's a lonely drifter wondering the streets of a morally and economically abandoned America. After a great war that tore a hole in the sky and upset the balance of the sun, the world more or less came to an end.

That was over 30 years ago and Eli has been walking ever since. He, like those few who survived, cannot go outside without shades on; as the sky has turned to a desolate burnt mass that will blind you. The brilliant filmmakers (Albert and Allen Hughes) who brought us From Hell; have crafted a very unique and appealing-to-the-cinematic-eye, landscape for Denzel's character to trek across.

Eli has one mission: to protect a sacred book that he has in his possession, and to take it west. Faith is his employer; faith in the heavenly voice that has told him to do so.

Please don't make the ignorant mistake that others have made by assuming that it has taken him 30 years to walk from A to B. His path has been unknown to him, as is all of ours in life, and those 30 years were spent with him learning from and experiencing things of which the film does not need to show us. Plus, his path leads him to a place where he interacts with certain characters that would not have been there 30 years ago or even 15 years ago, and he needs to meet them in order for his destiny to be fulfilled entirely.

This is a very religious film, if you didn't pick up on it from the beginning of this review or from the advertising. Eli is being led by God, okay. I know it's a movie, but films of the past have asked us to accept much more unbelievable elements and we all have; so just go with it and have some fun.

Eli is met along the way by sadistic motorcycle gangs and rapists and thieves; really bad guys. People butcher and slaughter one another for food, water, sex and whatever else you may have to offer them. Eli partakes in none of this, and handles those who oppose his goal appropriately to his situation and to the genre of this film - he kills them; violently, innovatively, and in very entertaining ways.

If you are some-one who believes strongly that violence is never the answer, no matter what the situation, then skip this film and go watch Sesame Street instead. It's jam-packed with violence; justified violence. Let's face it - sometimes the only way to counter violence, is to retaliate with even more of it. That's a fact folks.

Eventually Eli stumbles into a town run by a heinous dictator. Who better to play a grizzly villain, than the villain's villain himself: Gary Oldman. From Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element, to True Romance and The Professional, Oldman has portrayed some of the most celebrated movie-psychotics of all time. He adds The Book of Eli to that list with another phenomenal performance as Carnegie.

Carnegie is the guy you have seen a thousand times in different westerns; the bully who has taken over the town and has his own personal henchman, and is forcing a beautiful woman to be his love interest. But it's the sadistic charm that Oldman brings to this character that sets him apart from others. He is magnificent and terrifying.

Carnegie's agenda is to get his hands on a sacred book that he believes will grant him power to rule everyone left alive on our miserable planet. The book is of course the one which Eli possesses.

When Eli wonders into Carnegie's town for supplies, he finds some trouble. After a bloody battle is had, leaving Eli victorious, Carnegie is impressed with his skills and wishes to hire him as part of his crew. When Eli refuses, Carnegie grants him a free night in his hotel with a generous meal, in hopes of persuading him. Eli accepts the offer and stays the night.

Jennifer Beals gives a terrific performance as Claudia, that woman being forced into Carnegie's life that we discussed earlier. Her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is forced to work in the saloon and sometimes provide sexual favors to guests. Carnegie forces her to offer herself to Eli, in one of the film's best and most enduring scenes.

Obviously, Eli declines her gesture and befriends her instead. The two create a strong partnership and flee from Carnegie and his group of degenerate dirt-bags. Naturally they follow, and several interesting interactions are had before the film reaches its end.

The violence in the film will no doubt confuse many, as that's all they will see it as. They will miss the fact that Eli is on a quest from God, and never once invites an altercation upon himself. Eli is always grief stricken or warn-down by his acts of violence and finds no pleasure in them.

There is one scene in the film where he does kill an unarmed man, but I believe that he either does this because God tells him to, as the guy is evil and will murder others as he has just attempted to do to Eli; or he does this because of the simple fact that the man will bleed to death, in the middle of no-where, as a result of the injury he has sustained.

You'll be impressed to know that Denzel did al of his own stunts in this film, and trained severely to make these action sequences look believable. They do.

The Book of Eli also has one of the most original endings ever seen in any film; right up there with the shock-value of The Sixth Sense. Watching it a second time, makes it as equally painstakingly obvious with clues, but hardly anyone will ever catch it the first time around.

It's good to see a big Hollywood-backed movie that evokes a strong Christian theme. You don't catch too many of those. Eli gives a terrific quote in the film that has and will continue to stick with me: ""There's always a choice.""",1273190400,5,6112,4.53133514986376

I think i have purchased less than 5 movies in the last 10 years but this is one movie that I have to buy.  It has a lot of gore and violence so obviously not for young kids or anything like that but this is a great movie for a mature audience.  I gotta say there have been a lot of post apocalyptic films out there lately, and I liked a lot of them but this one is by far my favorite.  I'll sum it up by saying the great story and great acting make for a great action film.  Hope you all like it as much as I did.",1272499200,,607,3.5681818181818183

The cast played the movie as if times were ""lost"" and really makes you feel all of the emotions that come  and go throughout the unorthodox scenes. As always I feel like a movie that has Denzel Washington in the mix usually has a hidden message, or a lesson to be learned.  Just one of the lessons that was assummed throughout, and at the end movie, that should be practiced throughout our lives daily is: ""Never judge a book by its cover.""",1271376000,,754,4.378571428571429

Although way better than Legion, Book of Eli still needed a bit more action in it. The commercials sold it like that, but it needed more. But when Denzel was slicin and dicin - it was bad to the bone!

4102014,5,B003A8FET6,FIRST!!! Do not let anyone tell you about the movie before watching it. You don't want any of the surprise to be spoiled for you. All I will say is I saw it twice at the movie theatre and loved it both times. The second time makes you go back at look at things in the movie much differently. Great movie!!! I think this movie was over looked at the theatres due to Avatar. But this is a much better film. Denzel should win an Oscar for this role.,1268179200,10,446,4.022471910112359

If you haven't seen it, you have to rent it or better yet buy it when it comes out!",1267574400,,504,3.9411764705882355
4102016,5,B003A8FET6,"I saw this film by accident. I actually went to the theatre to see ""Avatar"" (like everyone else in the state that day) and decided to see the Book of Eli since Avatar was sold out. I'm glad that I did.

The Book of Eli is an amazing film for many reasons, mainly because it handles its religious themes with a intelligence and an even hand. This is NOT an action film - that is the mistake; the movie is a religious fable but not a heavy-handed fire-and-brimstone manner.

Denzel Washington stars as Eli, a man on a cross country mission in a post-apocolyptic America. People have resorted to cannibalism to survive. While Eli stops by a small relatively civilized town, he is confronted by the film's villain played by Gary Oldman who is the leader of the town. He has been searching the countryside, looking for a special book, the book that Eli has pledged to carry across the country. The film revolves around Eli's escape from the town, with a young girl in tow, and his journey across the country.

So that is the basic plot. There is a ""surprise"" ending at the end, but there is more going on than just the basic plot. The power of faith, fake religious leaders, miracles and hope are themes that are explored in this film in a very intelligent and effective manner. The Book of Eli can appeal not on the Christians, but the ideas in this movie can speak to people of any faith - or no faith. Its a very positive movie.

Its amazing that this movie was made, it really struck me on a deep emotional level. It will not be popular with the Pat Robertsons of the world due to its criticism of the misuse of religion. Some people will be far too jaded to accept this movie for what it is. I highly recommend this film to anyone; at least watch it once. I can't wait to see it again.",1267488000,14,1785,4.3194029850746265

Story is well told; definitely a lot of showing more than telling.

Minimalist but very strong concentration of the wasteland. Watch how people act around each other even in the simplest of situations. You really do get the sense of how untrusting society has become. The acting from all the characters is superb.

Well done movie.",1267056000,,597,5.197916666666667
4102018,4,B003A8FET6,"Why does it keep asking me if I am over 13? Do Amazon think I might be Benjamin Button and be growing younger, or perhaps I am testament to the education system that Wexford is producing very erudite and splenetic 12 years olds? I digress....

""Can I tell you about the word of our Lord""?

Is one phrase that thankfully that Eli managed to avoid. The following also does not appear..

Washington ""Can I interest you in a Watchtower?""
Oldman ""No thanks, I'm quite happy with my hotel thank you"".

Its 30 years in the future, the bombs fell, the world ended, nuclear fire blossomed and the fire of the sun scorched the earth. The stunned survivors roamed shooting, gouging and murdering each other, civilisation fell, the wheels of industry stopped turning, and yet still, the roads in The Book of Eli are still in better condition than those we have in Wexford.

The world was broken some 30 years previously when some sort of war occurred and probably destroyed the ozone layer causing the world to be flooded with UV light. In the short term, everybody got a lovely tan, but in the long term, everyone who managed not to live underground for a year died. A year?? Who on earth could live underground for an entire year?

In the intervening years, the lazy good for nothing folk of Carnegie's town had done nothing at all to tidy up the place, it looked like a ruin, there's no excuse for living in a ruin, its sheer laziness.
Eli is wandering around the place lugging a Bible that he reads from lovingly every night, as he listens to his IPod, not you understand, one of those crappy ones that break down after 5 minutes, but one that lasts for 30 years, before he has to recharge it, perhaps it is solar powered or something? Tom Waits was actually tasked with recharging it during the film, but presumably resisted the temptation to load any of his own tunes onto it.
The other thing that everyone has is a supply of cool sunglasses, which is great. I don't know how they do it; I lose mine all the time.

And the last thing you would probably want to see in the post apocalyptic world is some bloke with a Bible. I mean, thinking about all of the wars caused in the name of religion, the Inquisition, the Crusades, oppression of people and cleric abuse, an outbreak of organised religion would be the last thing I would like to see. And what is the big deal? The folk he meets in the town  could have the following conversation. Observe.

Townsman - ""Howdee stranger, what have you got there?""
Eli ""I have a Bible"".
Townsman ""What's that all about then? What happens at the end?""
Eli - ""Why, Revelations, Armageddon, the end of the world!!!""
Townsman (expansively indicating the post apocalyptic landscape) ""Seen it already.""

Anyhoo, Carnegie (Gary Oldman) decides that the bible represents a handbook to dominate and oppress and entirely new market segment, and he might well have been right. You see, the survivors of the apocalypse had destroyed every other copy of the Bible in America, so this is the last one.  Even those Gideon ones. Oldman lives in a town centre hotel, he might like to have checked his bedside table, which would have been ironic if there was one there all the time.

Oldman wants the Bible; Washington has a higher calling for it. Shenanigans ensue. There is some chopping, a bit of stabbing, some shooting.

In the end, there is an ironic and moderately unexpected twist, which frankly on first viewing is really outstandingly daft, I mean mega daft, but the point of the film is faith, and so you have to take the silly twist on faith as well, which sort of makes it more bearable.

I really rather liked the post apocalyptic setting of the film, its well done, the washed out colour and the utter devastation is nicely realised. Oldman and Washington are solid in their performances, the fight scenes are well realised without being graphic, for me, who loves the post apocalyptic genre, this was an enjoyable film, and recommended. Mad Max, it is not. More ""Reasonable Max"".",1267056000,,4010,4.598039215686274

I have now begun to doubt the integrity of actors that I actually liked; Washington and Oldman - did these guys read the script before signing on or were they duped?
If you have half a brain or even a modicum of taste avoid this movie like the plague.",1266969600,10,702,4.6
4102020,1,B003A8FET6,"In short - this movie is horrible!  First off, it has a blatant fundamentalist-evangelical theme.  Mad-Max after the Rapture.  Make a religious propaganda movie all you want but inform the audience what they're getting themselves into.  I feel I was dupped into watch something that made me feel very uncomfortable.  In reading the many positive reviews here, it strikes me as troubling how many people have no trouble with the fundamentalist message of this flick - it didn't even seem to register. Have fantasies of violence paired with a dubious religious agenda really become this mainstream? Is the new brand of hero a guy with a bible in one hand and a gun in the other?  Even if it weren't for all the evangelizing this movie is just a bad movie.  Too many scenes with drawn-out gratuitous camera shots, dialog that is often cartoonish and so corny it made me cringe, over-the-top fight scenes (Kill Bill without the humor) and gratuitous violence (which I have no problem with were it not used to transport a religious agenda), a whole array of preposterous scenes: an old husband and wife team shooting it out with thugs using their cache of submachine guns, thugs shooting up a farmhouse with an arsenal of guns, bazookas & gatlin guns (!) only to miss the 2 main characters standing behind a wooden wall, hero being shot pointblank but not suffering a scratch (God protected him I guess), a teenage girl turning into the new road warrior without training, silly voice-overs, a civilization subsisting on almost no water, a guy taking 30 years to walk across the US, cannibal couple living in the middle of the waste lands but miraculously stocked up on a constant supply of fresh meat, thugs destroying their only bar in town just for the sake of destroying it (where d'we go to have a drink now boss...duh), awkward scenes abound (the saying-grace at breakfast scene), Hero shooting a crappy self-made kids bow with lethal precision and then neglecting to retrieve his valuable arrows in a land where everything is scavanged, and on and on.

4102021,3,B003A8FET6,"It did have the effect of making us argue afterwards, and all weekend long, about the two so-called surprise twists in the picture.  It's worth seeing if only for that good post-mortem that sends you to the diner arguing over french fries about the real meaning of the scene between Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals.

Otherwise, the film is ridiculously bleak and heavyhanded.  Tumbleweeds, check.  Sepia tones throughout, check.  Cannibals, check.  It is a patchwork of familiar elements that you have seen done better in a hundred other movies.  In one scene, Denzel is held captive in a cell-like room decorated only by a tattered poster from a long-ago 70s apocalypse film, Don Johnson in A Boy and His Dog--itself so much better than The Book of Eli it seemed almost as if the movie was taunting itself!  But instead it was probably intended as a homage...  Much of the movie was one homage stitched onto another...  When Mila Kunis made the sign of the cross to a leering Gary Oldman, it was so much like Bram Stoker's Dracula it was crazy!  And what about the old, decrepit desert house occupied by the two seniors, who call themselves George and Martha?  Their names recall the central couple in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but why?

Denzel, Gary Oldman, most of the actors were good, but against all odds.  The things they had to say and act out were ludicrous.  Defeated, perhaps by her character arc, perhaps by her own limitations, was poor Mila Kunis.  I thought Kylie Minogue, much as I love her, a bad actress, but Mila Kunis makes Kylie seem like Dame Judi Dench in comparison.  And yet, I wound up liking her just the same, especially when I read the interview with her that said in preparation for playing ""Solara"" opposite Denzel Washington, she had tried to read the Bible.  ""Which part?""  ""The first part.  Genesis.  But I just couldn't finish it.  It was good but it was boring.""  Now, that's what my dad used to call ""stick to it-ive-ness.""",1266710400,3,1972,4.685131195335277

4102023,5,B003A8FET6,"The Hughes Brothers film, ""The Book of Eli"" is a well-acted, well-crafted, surprising story of faith, love, and hope, even in the midst of chaos and destruction.

The film takes place 30 years after a nuclear apocalypse. A lone traveller named Eli, played by Denzel Washington makes his way toward the Western United States. In his possession is a King James Bible, thought to be the last one in existence. Books of faith like the Bible have been held responsible for the worlds destruction, and therefore most have been destroyed. Eli feels that he is being lead Westward and the book will be safe at journey's end.

As he travels, he encounters the familiar kind of desperation that we have come to expect from watching the Mad Max films and similar post-nuclear movies. Roving bands of thieves stealing, raping, and killing. Things like water and fuel becoming rare and prized possessions, and a general bleakness that threatens anyone and everyone. Through this landscape, Eli travels, until he comes to a town run by Gary Oldman and his maurauding gangs. Oldman's gangs are in search of a particular book that Oldman thinks will leverage his power over the townspeople. The book? The Bible. He soon discovers that Eli has one in his possession. One that only Eli opens and reads. The tale continues as Oldman's gang pursues Eli in order to get the Bible. Eli has been saddled with a sidekick, played by Mila Kunis, the daughter of Oldman's blind girlfriend, who is played by Jennifer Beals.

This film has lots of familiar elements, indeed, but also rises above what could seem to barren ground on the strength of the great performances - Washington, Oldman, Kunis, Beals, etc, and a surprise or two at the end that causes one to revisit lots of what they saw in the last hour plus. This film is a very good one because it has a lot to say, and it says it well.",1266105600,,1866,4.665653495440729
4102024,3,B003A8FET6,"I just saw this one in the theater.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I wasn't overly impressed.  Denzel Washington was great, as always, and so was Gary Olman, but the story line was a wee bit slow at times and kind of lacking a punch.  It was a little gory, too (at least for me, anyway--not really my kind of movie).

The story begins with fallen ash and dead bodies everywhere.  There has been a massive war that has left many dead and the land stripped.  It has become survival of the fittest for the most part.  Gangs are worse than wild animals and often ambush folks and take whatever they can to survive. Water and food are hard to find.  Some people even resort to eating human meat, and they are the ones with shaky hands.  The basic scene is very similar to Mel Gibson's ""Mad Max"" movie from the 1970s (?).

Denzel (Eli) is our hero.  He walks the land in peace, trying to survive, but he can also defend himself when others try to mess with him.  He is unbelievably quick with a knife, gun, or arrow and when he must kill, he prays over the bodies.  He carries a book with him and is on a mission from God to take the book to the West Coast.  The book is the King James Bible.  After the war, all other remaining copies of the book were destroyed.

Gary Olman is a power hungry bad guy who is searching for the same book, because it is said to give power to its owner and he wants to create a kingdom for himself out of what's left.  Gary gets a bit overly enthusiastic when he finds out that Eli has that book and the struggle begins.

As I said, it's good but not great, although both actors do an excellent job in their roles.  Would I watch it again?  No!",1265846400,2,1676,4.114197530864198
4102025,5,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli was a moving experience for me.  The story revolves around a wanderer named Eli who carries the last existing copy of the King James Bible for 30 years looking for the right person to give it to.  Along the way, he encounters the harsh reality of the post-apocalyptic world around him (a brutal environment, lawlessness, and a very determined local town boss named Carnegie who wants the book as a tool to control people).  The movie has a lot to say, which is refreshing for a movie with a lot of action.  In fact, it's hard to argue against The Book of Eli having more message behind it than any other major movie in years.  It examines the role of pure faith in our lives and how it interacts with the more earthly thing we call religion, which can be used for great good or great evil.

The central conflict is between Eli and Carnegie.  Both are ultimately archetypes.  Eli is the humble man who lives what most of us would consider a near-ideal of absolute faith and dedication, with his one flaw being that he sometimes puts his task to protect the bible ahead of living by the teachings inside it.  In truth, this isn't so much a fault as a survival necessity if he is ever going to complete his mission to hand off the book, but it still is an issue that comes to bother him.  In this way, Eli reflects us all, and in his mission, he reflects a better way of living and the hope of building back a better world than the one that was destroyed.  Carnegie, for me, represents the desire to build back the world we currently live in.  For all he villainous ways, he's ultimately just a reflection of our modern world.  If he could get the bible, he would use it to gain personal power as he used religion as a tool to build an empire of followers around him, like a modern-day Mohammad (in the realpolitik military and political sense).  Probably he would also make people's lives easier and better superficially as he created more new towns and got ""civilization"" started again, but he desires the same corrupted world we live in today.  It's no coincidence that he's named after a legendary figure in our world who was very powerful and who shaped our civilization in a lot of ways.  It's also no coincidence that he is the one guy who acts and talks like someone from our world.  Excellent, seminal stuff.  Denzel Washington deserves an Oscar for his stoic, perfect performance.

The other delicious part of The Book of Eli is the twist revelation late in the movie.  It caught me completely by surprise, but it fit the tone of the movie perfectly, and it made so much sense looking back.  It's one of those movies like Sixth Sense where you'll want to re-watch it after you find out just to see if the filmmakers covered all their bases!  That injects a little extra fun and life into the movie just at the time when the story itself is becoming more hopeful and rebirth dominates as a theme.

While most people focus on the use of the Bible as the object of interest, you can replace it with any other books of knowledge (Koran, Torah, etc.) and the movie loses none of its messages.  Turn your attention to the relationships, the moral lessons presented, what can happen when humans are isolated, and more importantly, the order of power when selfish people control our limited resources.  This is a treatise on what can happen if we do not pay attention to the signs of our day: our children 'graduating' from high school unable to read, weather changes, iran with weapon grade uranium, wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. If we do not make rapid effective changes in our approach to dealing with each other and our environment, we will sadly leave a world like that depicted in this movie to our children.",1265414400,3,1130,4.804123711340206

Stuff like this should come with a label:  ""Warning:  Intended for Right-Wing Christians.""  I might as well have invested in a Tim LaHaye book rather than wasting my time and money on this.

It is post-apocalypse.  There was another world war, caused by religion, and after it was over (after the ""flash"" which burned almost everyone), people burned all the bibles, so that religion could never again destroy the world. Or so they thought.

Eli, played by Denzel Washington, is walking west across the United States, carrying a copy of the last Bible in the world.  A ""voice"" told him to ""go west"" and carry the Bible.  During his quest (when he's not proselytizing), God protects him, enabling him to repeatedly chop off the heads and hands of his enemies.  He encounters the ruler of a town who seriously wants the Bible, because if he has it, he can become all powerful. With the Bible, this ruler will be able to get people to do anything he wants them to do.

Eli escapes, however, and continues west to Alcatraz, where there is a group of people hoarding books and artifacts from the pre-apocalypse world.  They have a printing press, of course, and promptly print thousands of copies of the Bible, to be re-distributed to the religion-damaged world--- proving, once again, that you just can't get rid of stupidity and superstitution.",1265155200,24,1496,4.823529411764706
4102028,5,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli is a vastly underappreciated film that mixes martial arts swordsmanship, a post-apocalyptic setting, and a biblical narrative.

A war, over thirty years ago, killed off many people in the United States. Others were blinded from the blast.  This creates an interesting disparity between those over thirty years of age who received an education and those under thirty who know nothing of the modern world (at one point, one of the thugs asks, ""What's a television?"").

This is an unpleasant world. Cannibalistic brigands ambush unwary travelers, identifiable by their shaking hands. Water is at a premium.  Batteries are hard to find.  The Book of Eli makes it clear that there's no currency, only barter.

Roaming the land is Eli (a subdued Denzel Washington), carrying a book with a cross on it.  This book is greatly desired by Carnegie (a greasy Gary Oldman), who is also old enough to remember the power such a tome can have over the people.  While Eli has been wandering for thirty years in pursuit of such a destination, Carnegie has been sending illiterate henchmen to retrieve every book he can find.  The encounter between the two has all the fire and brimstone of a battle between heaven and hell.

Thrown into the mix is Solara (played beautifully by Mila Kunis, who finally sheds her trademark accent), a young, attractive girl who has grown up under Carnegie's protection but, as she flowers into womanhood, is about to become a bargaining chip, a piece of meat, and a lure.  When there's no one left to protect her, she becomes a wanderer in Eli's footsteps.

From a religious point of view, it's educational to understand who Eli was in the Bible. In the Bible, Eli's children are cursed for behaving wickedly, a parallel for the war that destroyed civilization in the movie. God's curse assures that all men will ""die by the sword"" - in the movie Eli expertly cuts a bloody swath through his enemies with his machete. In the Bible, it was the job of Eli's sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.

There's a twist ending that's not a twist of all if you read up about Eli in the Bible. But don't - watch the movie, then do some research, then watch the movie again.  Like Eli's quest for spiritual fulfillment, the experience will be rather eye-opening.",1265155200,307,2359,4.653012048192771
4102029,5,B003A8FET6,"The Book of Eli was a really well done movie with good visuals, and good script, and good acting, and also good action.

The visuals fit it was sort of like the visuals in I AM LEGEND OR RESIDENT EVIL APOCOLYPSE.

The script was good but don't want to tell to much about it because I read pretty much every scene in the movie before seeing it and it lost a little of the surprize.  To be as vague as possible the movie is about a man in this wasteland where there are gangs of scavengers trying to kill and steal from everyone.  He is trying to go west.  He has a book that is very important to him and he seems to not be a thief or a murderer and will kill only when it is in self defense.  There is a town that he arrives in that is ran by a guy named Carnagie played by Gary Oldman and he sees that he is different and able to dispatch his gangs of raiders with ease and want to recruit him.  That is as far as I will go with the plot.  To me anything else would spoil it.

The acting was very well done.  I was surprized that the girl from the 70's show that was kelso's girl friend was so good.  I think her name is mila kunis or something like that.  Denzel was very good to watch and was as fun to watch when he wasn't speaking as when he was.  His facial expresions and mannerisms were acting he didn't have to tell you how he felt.  Gary Oldman was good as a guy trying to be powerfull and be in charge of the towns people and was a little crazy and mean.

The action was well done too.  There was violence but it kind of showed shadows of the men after the first bloody limb being cut off as to avoid it being sick or some sort of twisted black comedy like kill bill.  The action was frantic and there were probably a well placed action scene about every 15min or so.  I would recommend the movie but if you don't like violence and are offended by language you may not enjoy yourself as much even though there is a positive message to the movie.

4102030,2,B003A8FET6,"The Hughes Brothers, Allen and Albert, are not exactly the most prolific writing and directing team working in film. Their last film, ""From Hell"", is a criminally underrated and poorly timed release starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham in an adaptation of a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper. It was released a few weeks after the 9/11 attacks and was all but ignored. Their new film, ""The Book of Eli"" is also based on a graphic novel. Despite a few interesting moments and a couple of good performances, the film is nowhere near as successful as their last effort. Given their track record, we have another seven or eight years to see if they hit the mark again.

Eli (Denzel Washington) travels alone across a desolate landscape. As he rummages through abandoned and dilapidated homes and walks past the husks of rusted out cars, we quickly get the sense something bad has happened, something big that caused their way of life to change. As Eli makes his way west, we see he has two prized possessions. The first is an old IPOD he has jerry-rigged to a battery, to listen to music, to give himself an escape from the desolation around him. The second is a large leather bound book with a lock and a cross on the cover, a bible which he reads on a nightly basis. One day, he approaches a crumbling freeway interchange and watches as a group of motorcycle bandits quickly overtakes a man and a woman traveling together. They kill the man, take their possessions and begin to rape the woman. Eli watches, trying to decide if he should reach out, if he should get involved and help the woman. He decides to move on. Later, he comes to a town populated by a group of survivors and led by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie lords over his people by controlling the food and water. He also provides alcohol drugs and women to the populous, operating out of a makeshift brothel carved out of an abandoned theater. Carnegie sends his teams out to scour the countryside looking for a book. When Eli arrives, he realizes the bike gang is in the bar and quickly takes them out with his sword and some fancy footwork. News travels to Carnegie and he wants to meet the new arrival. Carnegie wants Eli to work for him, to help him rebuild society. They are both survivors and know what life was like before the war thirty summers ago and they can both read. But Eli declines. Soon, Carnegie learns of Eli's bible, the very book he had been searching for. He sends Solara (Mila Kunis), the daughter of his companion (Jennifer Beals), a blind woman whom he adores, to visit Eli and spend the night with him. But Solara soon realizes Eli is different and might be able to help her escape. They reluctantly team up and continue west. But Carnegie isn't going to give up that quickly.

When a film takes place in a different time or reality than our own, it has to work very hard to establish this landscape and to make us believe in everything that is happening. The filmmakers are extremely successful in one regard and less so in another. The landscape Eli travels is bleak, gray and desolate. As he walks through the gray, dressed in an old army jacket and a pair of wrap around sunglasses, nothing he passes looks like it was built recently and this fits extremely well with the back story we learn during the course of the film. A nuclear war happened thirty years ago and the survivors have been struggling to live ever since. People like Carnegie have power because he is able to control things like water and food. Most of the people surrounding people like Carnegie and Eli are younger and many have been born after the war. This means most are unable to read. Because of this, Carnegie realizes the power a bible might have and seeks to find a copy.

When Eli first spots the lone couple pushing a shopping basket with all of their belongings, he stops and watches them. The bike gang quickly overtakes them, kills the man and rapes the woman. But Eli just watches from his perch high above, tentatively reaching for his machete. He decides not to interact. Yet, later, he cautiously approaches a woman sitting on the ground next to her overturned shopping cart, apparently unable to move. Why is he reluctantly willing to help one and not the other? Later, Eli talks vaguely about his journey and it seems like he is on a quest. But how can we believe in his quest when he reluctantly agrees to help some, but not others. As we begin to learn more about the extent and meaning of Eli's journey, this double standard becomes even more troubling and problematic to the narrative.

Denzel Washington is always good and as Eli he brings the right amount of seriousness and conviction to the role. We get he has a serious goal for his journey and he won't let anything stand in his way. When  he realizes the danger Carnegie presents, he simply walks away, trying to avoid further conflict. Of course, Carnegie can't let it end. When he has to help Solara, he does so reluctantly because it will impede his journey. But we get the sense that some part of his journey might be leading him to provide her with a hand.

Washington is an extremely charismatic actor and he is just about always good, even when he appears in films that don't match his skill. Unfortunately, as one of the top stars in Hollywood, he continues to appear in films that don't match his skill. So for every film that reminds us why he is a star with great skill (""Crimson Tide"", ""American Gangster"", ""Devil in a Blue Dress""), he appears in an almost equal number of films that give us reason to question his skill (""Dj Vu"", ""The Siege""). Washington clearly likes to work with the same people (he has appeared in a number of Tony Scott films (""Crimson Tide"", ""Man on Fire"") but I have to wonder why he appears in so many films that don't live up to his ability. Is it the money? Is he anxious to make more films? If so, why doesn't he use his start power to make these problematic films better?

Gary Oldman is good as Carnegie, the man who realizes the people, the few survivors, need to believe in something. He also realizes that if he possesses this, he will become more powerful and more legendary. He rules his kingdom with a quiet intensity. It is interesting to watch him interact with Claudia (Jennifer Beals), his blind lover. When the motorcycle gang brings back some shampoo, he eagerly uses it to wash Claudia's hair, thrilled to provide her with the luxury. But when he sees an obstacle in his way, he has no qualms about ordering his men to remove the barrier.

Mila Kunis is less interesting as Solara. Carnegie initially orders her to spend the night with Eli and she is clearly not used to fulfilling such requests. But when she realizes Eli is not interested, she pleads with him to simply let her stay the night. If she is sent away, Carnegie won't like it and she will have trouble. Later, when they begin the quest, Kunis seems to be simply moving her character through the emotions. She is unable to really make us believe she shares the same intensity as Eli.

Ray Stevenson (HBO's ""Rome"", ""The Punisher: War Zone"") plays Carnegie's security. Stevenson is always interesting to watch, he has a certain intensity about him which causes us to watch him, even when he is saying mundane things or unable to contribute to the narrative.

There are a couple of interesting action scenes. Early on, Eli is confronted by a motley band of survivors who are looking to score something to eat (cannibalism seems to be common in this time). He gives them a chance, informing them if they continue they won't survive. They laugh and confront him. Eli moves under an old overpass and the entire fight happens in darkness, we are only able to see their silhouettes. He quickly dispatches the group, beheading more than a few of the attackers. In fact, this one scene has more beheadings than I have ever seen in a single film before. The scene is interesting visually and there are a couple of moments like this. But the rest of the film concerns Eli's slow journey across a barren landscape. It feels a bit like someone touched a fast forward button (for the fight scenes) a few times while watching a DVD of the rest of the film.

There is a final ""ah huh"" moment. And it is interesting, but it unfortunately raises more questions and starts to make the viewer look more closely at the rest of the narrative, trying to spot any other problems, holes and poorly constructed bits. When this happens, the film has to be air tight, to withstand such scrutiny.

And ""The Book of Eli"" isn't.",1264982400,4,8561,4.544747081712062
4102031,2,B003A8FET6,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

On the whole, I have not been impressed with Denzel's body of work since he won his second Oscar for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Training-Day-Snap-Case/dp/B00005JKED/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Training Day (Snap Case)</a>, and this film does nothing to reverse that trend.

In this, he plays a lone warrior wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but unlike most other protagonists in films like this, he actually has a place to go and something to do. I won't say where he's going or why, but he's been doing it for over 30 years, which quite possibly makes him the hero with the worst sense of direction ever (has he ever heard of a map and compass?). But I digress.

It starts interestingly enough, establishing his character in some ways you don't usually see. Of course he is a good fighter, as you have to be in a world like this, but then he unheroically leaves a couple of fellow wanderers to the untender mercies of some roaming bikers after dealing with a larger group of bandits. What, now he's afraid to fight? I suppose that, given his purpose, that can be excused, but that's still a bit hard to swallow.

Anyway, he comes across a small town ruled by the iron fist of Gary Oldman, whose great power is that he can...read. That's not a typo, he can read, and that is apparently all the power he needs. We never once see him do anything that shows his evil nature, unless you count him raising his voice against a couple of women and pulling on the hair of a blind Jennifer Beals. Come on, this is Gary Oldman, the King of Psychotic Villains, and this is the best you can do with him?

I could go on with other problems, such as there being no final showdown in the third act or Denzel's ability to survive a gut shot long after he should have been dead, but frankly I can't go any further. The more I type, the more I realize exactly how much this movie sucked and the less chance I have of forgetting that I saw it. About the only good thing about this movie the ""sacred"" item he had and a few neat twists at the end, but definitely not worth the price of admission.",1264896000,11,2170,4.625974025974026
4102032,3,B003A8FET6,"Super-bad dude (Denzel Washington) is walking west through an entirely typical post-apocalyptic desert landscape.  It's all shot on digital video, and for once the format looks just right for the gray, washed-out landscapes.  After wasting a bunch of thugs with a wicked long knife/short sword, Denzel wanders into a one-horse town run by a nasty boss-type guy played by who else?  Ben Gazzara.  No, just kidding, but Gary Oldman is channeling him I think.  Heck, I dunno, maybe there's just a generic amoral town boss type and everybody tends towards it if they play these roles enough.

Also in the town are Tom Waits as a shopkeeper (entertaining for his few minutes of time but wasted) and Mila Kunis as the daughter of Oldman's blind kept woman, Jennifer Beals.  After Denzel goes all Toshiro Mifune on a bunch of Oldman's men who've just returned from raiding, Oldman takes an interest; and after finding out that Denzel has a precious book, he's even more interested.  You want to guess what the book is?  I don't think you'll find it too hard...

This is a rather silly and derivative movie that vacillates between various tough guy genres - post-apocalyptic science fiction, spaghetti western, samurai film.  The after-the-end-of-the-world stuff doesn't come off as much different than what we've seen in dozens of films from A BOY AND HIS DOG through MAD MAX and this past year's THE ROAD - gray deserts, shattered towns and cities, little animal or vegetable life, dust, hopelessness.  The close-in fighting sequences feel like updated Kurosawa, and sharp-eared viewers will note that one of Oldman's henchmen whistles the theme from Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA at a couple of points during the film.  Denzel  is doing the taciturn, emotionless staring type of anti-hero best exemplified by Clint Eastwood in the ""Dollars"" trilogy, though he brings his own particular kind of charisma and even a certain warmth the role; he and Mila Kunis (somewhat miscast I think but trying her best and looking a bit too lovely in this grimy environment) are certainly the main reasons I saw the film and I can't say I was disappointed in them.

Besides all the tough-guy stuff and macho posturing though, the film wants to be - and say - something more.  Problem is that in the resolution (which I'm not going to spoil for ya) that something more has to be taken so literally and absolutely for the film to work that if you don't want to believe it (and it IS a matter of belief) you'll probably just find it all laughable.  And the film doesn't play out for the most part as a comedy - it's a lot more serious than most spaghetti westerns, even solemn at times.  Then again, you could just have fun with Denzel doing Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and any number of other macho action figures and maybe that's enough.

On a certain level, though, this film clearly wants to be taken seriously, wants to be something more than just a mindless action romp; the Hughes brothers who directed it haven't exactly shied away from Christian themes in their previous films, and here they are front and center and obvious.  You don't talk so much about religion - the Bible, specifically - if you don't have some kind of agenda.  But it's so damn muddled, and so careful to try to straddle various lines in order to have as wide an appeal as possible that I'm not sure it was worth it.  And in the final analysis, if this guy is carrying around a Bible and the message he's getting is ""kill anyone who stands in my way"", what does that say about the book, humanity, or this film?",1264809600,2,3582,4.68849840255591
4102033,5,B003A8FET6,"Excellent action movie with great fight scenes. Denzel was an awesome monk warrior and Mila Kunis was a babe not to be trifled with. The evil boss and his head crony were also well casted. The music and the way this movie was filmed gave it an epic feeling to it, but the story is too one dimensional to be deserving of an epic categorization. To give you an example, the entire movie was probably filmed at no more than ten different locations because that's all it really needed. I thought the ending was good because it was a surprise, but I probably would have preferred a final action scene that left the streets bloody.",1264723200,,625,4.443478260869565
4102034,5,B003A8FET6,"Let me first say I am by no means religious. In fact I would define my self as agnostic. I believe there is a higher power, I just don't believe in organized religion. I don't believe you need a church or a book to believe in a god or a higher power. I think all you need is faith, and that comes from within. Now I have no ill will toward religion as a whole. It can be used for great good. Giving people without hope, hope. Giving people the will to live and helping people do great things for the benefit of humanity. It can also used for great evil as all religions have done throughout the centuries, and I think that is ultimately the message I think the film conveys.

The Book of Eli is a religious movie that hides behind a post apocalyptic, western theme. Which follows Eli(Denzel Washington) as he wanders the wasteland heading west carrying the last remaining bible looking for the right person to give it to. On his journey west he comes to a town run by Carnegie(Gary Oldman) who so happens to be looking for a copy of the bible, so he can use it for his own means. Which puts the two at odds with each other, and with the add of Solara(Mila Kunis) the two go on the run. The climax and the twist near the end you will never see coming.

The acting
was brilliant. Washington and Oldman as usual do outstanding jobs. The supporting cast did a great job from Mila Kunis(who I thought was great.) to Ray Stevenson(Punisher: War Zone), Jennifer Beals(Lie To Me), and Malcolm McDowell(Heros and Fall Out 3).

The visuals were superbly done giving life to the pos apocalyptic world. You can imagine that's what the world would look like after a nuclear war, though they never say what caused the world to come to be except a war.

The directing by the The Hughes Brothers was well done. They haven't directed many movies. The only other one of their movies I've seen is From Hell which I personally loved. So from the two movies I've seen of theirs they are really good directors
who should get more work.

Overall this is the best film I've seen since Zombieland, and unlike the other recent movies I've seen The Book of Eli blends story with a message, acting, action, directing, and visuals perfectly. Out of all the movies out there right now this is by far the best, and I highly recommend it, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1264377600,6,2348,4.388505747126437

I give one star to films I wish I would have walked out of, and this certainly fits the bill.  I started checking my watch about 40 minutes into the movie, and continued to do so every 5 minutes.  It's just not enough entertainment, plain and simple.",1264204800,11,506,4.229166666666667

Yup, I began my review as a footnote to the subject line.

I had no knowledge of this movie beforehand, but I did have a couple of expectations based on what I saw of the commercials, and what a friend of mine told me.

1) I expected an epic, post-apocalyptic tale that completely engages you, and draws you into its gritty, dark world.

2) A friend of mine said he's never seen a crowd that quiet after the show. I took that to be a positive thing.

Only one of the two items listed above turned out to be true.

Let me cut straight to the chase- you take the religious aspect out of this movie and you're left with an average flick with bad pacing, ZERO character development, and poor directing.

What does it matter if it's The Bible or not? It's about a dude carrying a book and headed West because that's what god wants him to do. That's the story right there. And then you've got Meg from Family Guy teaming up with him, who rivals Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns as far as epic miscastings go.

**Usually in a movie where you're following one central character in a huge, lonely world, you really get engrossed with that character and really care about what happens next. Here they forgot about character development so nothing really mattered. We're just watching Denzel with glasses and a beard.

**While the fighting scenes were flashy, I don't like their choice of how they shot it, or portrayed his character. It's definitely fun to see Denzel as a total badass on-screen, but I don't get how his fighting skills are up to the level of being able to dispatch enemies in seemingly mere nano-seconds with absolutely RAZOR SHARP precision and accuracy, with NO MISTAKES. With or without the spoiler, that still doesn't explain it. This portrayal took away from the realism and made him seem like some superhero, or invincible. Was there any explanation given as to why he's able to operate in this manner? Was it because god was protecting him? That's a cop out answer. Is god the answer to anything that can't be explained with rational logic? Oh wait..

**Denzel and Meg from Family Guy had no chemistry in this movie. She plays the cookie cutter 'young, attractive girl fascinated by mysterious older man' role to a tee.

**How is it that a no name wannabe movie critic can see a a movie and easily point out the number of unnecessary (and embarrassing) slow motion shots in a movie, yet professional movie makers can't, and in fact, readily DOUSES the movie in it.

**My reviews aren't complete until I whine and moan about a character's decisions and illogical actions in a movie. Well we're at that point. The morning after Meg from Family Guy leaves Denzel's cell and goes to see her mother and Gary Oldman, she gets questioned by Gary Oldman about whether or not Denzel had a book. Just look at this scene, she could've EASILY just lied and said no. But instead, here she is cowering like a mindless retard, even as her mother gets threatened, she's standing there as if she's trying hard to hold in a secret, when in fact, all she had to do was adamantly state that THERE WAS NO BOOK and she has no idea what he's talking about. The kind of actions seen here would be the kind where some powerful mind reading overlord has someone captured, and that captured person knows that the overlord can easily see past his lies due to his supernatural abilities, so when questioned, he's very hesitant to lie because he knows the repercussions of lying, and so is more or less paralyzed with fear, not knowing whether lying or telling the truth would be the better choice. THAT SCENARIO DIDN'T APPLY HERE WITH MEG GRIFFIN AND GARY OLDMAN.

4102038,3,B003A8FET6,"The world following the apocalypse has become a nearly barren desert, populated by loosely knit groups of humans who cling to survival with dirty talons, and make little effort to cling to civilization.  Many drive modified motorcycles.  Into this desolation wanders a lonely figure, reluctantly on a journey that urges him to disassociate from humanity in favor of headlong movement across the landscape.  He is also a ferocious fighter when he needs to be, and under the hard exterior is capable of feeling a need for companionship and meaning.

Nope, I'm not describing THE ROAD WARRIOR.  I'm not talking about THE ROAD.  I'm talking about the very unoriginal THE BOOK OF ELI, starring Denzel Washington as the mysterious man Eli who is compelled to walk ever Westward across a landscape wrecked by nuclear war...where there are few survivors and many of them have turned to cannibalism.  He carries a book with him that is unique in what is left of mankind, and he believes that he must deliver this into the right hands.

On his path, he is frequently beset by violence...but fortunately, he has almost superhuman hand-to-hand fighting skills (and a very sharp sword), so that he can easily defeat 6 or more hardened, experienced fighting men in about 20 seconds flat.

He wanders into a town, where the self-appointed mayor (Gary Oldman) happens to be looking for the very book that Eli happens to be carrying.  Eli escapes, but is accompanied (much to his chagrin) by a spunk young lady (Mila Kunis) who is drawn to Washington's gentleness and probably by a chance to ""see the world.""  The two must fight off efforts to bring them back to this town, save the book and deliver it to the location Eli feels God has told him to bring it.

ELI is filmed in a washed out, sepia-toned manner, and is virtually devoid of any other color.  There are lots of shots of Eli moving across the barren land, and plenty of moments where he just stands in place and looks cool.  Denzel Washington has charisma to burn, and it is this charisma that makes the film watchable.  We immediately take to this quiet, mysterious man...because we immediately are drawn to Washington.  Washington talks very little, and except for two or three short bursts of action...seems to DO very little.  Yet he's fairly riveting, and that's due simply to his presence.  He doesn't so much give a performance as he gives a persona.

Were a lesser actor than Washington in this film, it would just be a slow-moving, sepia colored, B-level post-apocalyptic chore of a movie.  There's very little that's honestly original, and surprisingly little actual action.  I expected more fighting, but got very little when it was all said and done.  Gary Oldman, who has been such a great villain over the years, really never makes much of a foreboding presence.  We get that he's a bit crazy and a lot dangerous, but it feels vague and unspecific.  Surprisingly, Jennifer Beals makes a nice impression as Oldman's ""girlfriend"" and Mila Kunis' mother.  Kunis is working up an interesting film resume, having been credible now in things as diverse as ELI & FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.  I'm not ready to put her on the A-list yet, but I also never thought the kid who played Jackie on THAT `70s SHOW would have a viable film career.  She's actually pretty good, and towards the end of the film, has some nice moments with Washington which finally give the film a long overdue shot of human emotion.

In the end, your enjoyment of this movie will depend a lot on how much you like either a) Washington or b) post-apocalyptic films, no matter how derivative of far better films.  While I didn't mind the time I spent watching THE BOOK OF ELI...my time would have been better spent re-watching THE ROAD WARRIOR...the film that after all these years is STILL the gold-standard in this little subgenre.",1263772800,3,3853,4.769230769230769

Denzel Washington is amazing as a wanderer, who's been walking the roads for the last thirty years heading west, a man on a mission.  What's the goal?  Even he is not sure.  Just that he'll know it when he sees it.  He carries the book in his bag and protects it at all costs.

The world is a rough place after the bombs dropped.  The giant crater holes, the broken fragments of Man's civilization to where people have degraded to biker gangs and every person for themselves.

Only the older men and women who are literate have any hold on anyone else.  Books were burned and banned soon after the war to ""prevent this from happening again.""  Clearly a Fahrenheit 451 reference.  Keep the people ignorant and they can be more easily controlled.

Gary Oldman plays a guy who is running a town where he knows this is true.  He gets his biker gangs to go out and search for the book.  The Book that will get him control over the masses.  Using the words from the Bible will get him to raise up and take control over the cities in his area.  From history it is not the first time that faith in the Bible and religion has led to control over populations.

But the film is not saying that Oldman's character is right.  In fact, the selfless faith is what triumphs at the end.

And what an ending there is!  Can't spoil it, sorry.

The younger people in the film, the woman that befriends him and others, cannot read and have never learned to read.  The biker gang leaders can't read and they don't care -- they'll kill, rape and steal for a decent barter & trade.  The woman can't read either, but wants to know of the old days.  She starts out as a lousy character, frankly, but then develops into a strong character near the end of the film.

The photography with the washed-out colors and the sepia toned landscape and people was wonderfully shot and along with the stark music, gives a depressing yet hopeful mood.

Favorite scenes:

The silhouette where Denzel is whipping out his blade and slicing and dicing the bad guys, hand flies off, a few gut slices and blood splashes.  Yuk.

The stark, barren landscape, the blackened craters.  The sun so bright that everyone has to wear shades (apparently the ozone layer has been wiped out).

The old couple in a farm house who have a different taste in meat than most.  :)

This is not a religious film.  It's not even a film of having a religion.  It's about knowledge.  The smart, literate ones know the way to rebuild.  The illiterate ones want only to survive.  The stupid, literate ones want power.

Will Eli live long enough to see his dream happen?  The ending will surprise you, it clearly is not a pat, predictable story.

Highly recommended.",1263686400,23,2715,4.459183673469388

4102041,3,B003A8FET6,"By now, I'm sure every fan of the Fallout video games knows that the book Eli (Denzel Washington) is protecting is the Wasteland Survival Guide, while every Christian thinks it's the bible.  The Book of Eli is on the surface a great action thriller, but a major bummer of a movie in terms of its view on humankind.  It's like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/0307476308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>&nbsp;but only it assumes humanity requires religion in order to be civilized, a point I personally despise and disagree with vehemently.  Nevertheless, if we can pretend that in this little fictional futuristic world the word of god is imperative, else we all become cannibalistic sociopaths, then the Book of Eli can be forgiven.  I on the other hand will take its fundamentally preachy storytelling into account as a stern critic. For those reasons, the movie bothered me deeply.

The year is 2043 and the world has been a post-apocalyptic nightmare for thirty years.  Tribes roam the wasteland raping and pillaging while Eli (Washington) ""goes west"" with his book in his backpack and divine intervention as his protection.  Along the way he meets sexy Mila Kunis, whose acting is just above modeling; big old mean Ray Stevenson, who naturally rules every scene he is in; Tom Waits, one of my favorite musicians who becomes a futuristic tinkerer; a blind Jennifer Beals, who, like most women here is constantly the damsel in distress; and of course the always awesome baddie Gary Oldman, who does his very best Jack Nicholson while still piecing together some seriously cool villainy.  Obviously there are major spoilers here so I'll keep somewhat restrained, but Oldman's character is bent on finding the bible and using it to control civilization, while Eli hears voices that tell him to bring it elsewhere, and use it for better purposes, I guess.

Other than my huge gripes with some of the film's messages and altogether pessimistic assumptions of human individualism, I think this was a very good movie.  The action scenes are state of the art, the sound editing is not flawless but still works, the art direction and cinematography are exactly what I want to see in this kind of movie, and the soundtrack works extremely well with everything else.  The performances of Stevenson, Oldman, and of course Denzel, are all great within this kind of movie, and maybe even a little bit beyond those expectations.  Microcosmically and more specifically in terms of its dialogue, the screenplay is also worthy of some praise.  I can even say that the unlikely twists at the end were both unpredictable and effective, however the final few seconds of the movie were not only unnecessary but actually kind of silly and out of place.

It's a good all-around package, but if there is a niche audience hoping to see bloody machete/gun fights and some good old fashion bible-thumping, then it is going to be absolutely awesome for them.  In fact, all those Church groups that got together to see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B001JNNDGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>&nbsp;should reunite for some more gore and god.  The Book of Eli requires faith in god and belief in the bible to enjoy what it is fully.  I'm not so sure I can give it more than a mixed review altogether though, because if I'm troubled by these messages I can only begin to imagine what others more critical of the institution of religion might actually think.  I'd simply like to think it's much more than the authority of the bible which makes us less primal than animals.",1263686400,4,3701,5.233502538071066
4102042,5,B003A8FET6,"I really enjoyed this film.  It is a simple, moving story about post-apocalyptic life with a protagonist who through his faith manages to bring a particular faith to others who may otherwise not have it.  I'm not going to say much more  because I do not want to spoil it for others who have as yet to see it.  What I will end with is that there are no ""Holier than thou"" or overly preachy elements in the film The Book Of Eli, yet it is an easy (faith wise), beautiful and poignant film... beautiful musical score too.

4102043,3,B003A8FET6,"In a post apocalyptic world, the Book of Eli makes you wonder what kind of minds would it take to survive in a barren, unforgiving dystopia formerly known as Earth. Enter Denzel Washington as Eli, who may or may not be insane after wandering westward for the last 30 years through an ashen wasteland, and Gary Oldman as Carnegie, his eventual nemesis, and a man who apparently was ready to welcome the apocalypse with a big flinty hug. The First half of the film is well done and eerie, beginning with a brief, but fascinating hunt involving a a scrawny cat, as well as a beautifully executed silhouette fight scene straight out of a comic book. Eli is intense and mythical as he moves through a wonderfully rendered world of muddy browns and wounded skies that offer him his only comfort. His tools include a bow and arrow for catching dinner, a terribly sharp mid length blade that would do a Klingon proud and can slice and dice baddies with ease, and a battered Ipod for entertainment. Apparently Steve jobs built it to survive Armageddon--who knew! When the film reaches the outpost sequence it changes quite dramatically. Oldman and Washington play their roles to perfection as a life and death struggle ensues between the two (Eli has something Carnegie would love to get his dirty paws on to make him king of the world.) Mila Kunis, seeming more then a bit miscast in this film, manages to hold her own in Scenes with Oldman, Jennifer Beales who plays her mother, and Washington, as she forces her way into Eli's lonely existence and becomes his companion. There is religious overtone to this film that may or may not turn you off, but the film balances it with powerful action sequences and great humor. There are also a few huge twists at the end that are well executed. Be sure not to tell anyone what they are after you have seen it. Overall a solid, engrossing film that will entertain you without a doubt. Three stars all around.",1263686400,,1943,4.618497109826589
4102044,4,B003A8FET6,"I was expecting nothing more than a typical action flick set after a nuclear war when I sat down to watch The Book of Eli today. I had just found out a few days prior that the book he is carrying is suppose to be the last Bible on the Earth, so I kind of had an idea where this movie might be going, but it delved even deeper into the religious aspects than I had expected. There are a few well shot and brutal action scenes (I loved that silhouetted fight that didn't have one editing cut) and the cast is pretty solid. Denzel Washington doesn't say much and lets his machete do most of the talking, but his performance was good enough to make me care for Eli as a character. Gary Oldman is always a treat to watch in any role and he plays a a creepy, confident and compelling bad guy here, without going too over-the-top. Mila Kunis is fine as well (enough to forgive her for Max Payne), which really surprised me. While her looks alone seem to get her movie roles, at least her acting here is almost on par.

As you can see from the trailers, the whole movie has a sepia color tone, though it isn't as distracting as I had assumed it would be. There are some very nice visual shots from the Hughes Brothers and the set design, along with some of the locations are top of the line. Some might find parts of the film slow moving, but I liked the comfortable way it flowed. The twist at the end has been cut down by a number of critics, but it really caught me by surprise and I thought it worked in the sense that Eli always seemed to be more than normal man to begin with.

The Book of Eli isn't great entertainment from start to finish, but it gives you a little to think about in between the limbs being hacked off. Works for me.

4102046,5,B003A8FET6,"""The Book Of Eli"" is great! This is how the story goes: In the not-too-distant future, some 30 years after the final war, a solitary man walks across the wasteland that was once America. Empty cities, broken highways, seared earth--all around him, the marks of catastrophic destruction. There is no civilization here, no law. The roads belong to gangs that would murder a man for his shoes, an ounce of water... or for nothing at all.

But they're no match for this traveler.

A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive--and continue.

Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie, the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.

But neither will find it easy to deter him. Nothing--and no one--can stand in his way. Eli must keep moving to fulfill his destiny and bring help to a ravaged humanity.

The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also produced) (as Eli) & Gary Oldman (as Carnegie) is great! The directing by The Hughes Brothers (Albert & Allen) (both of them also directed ""Menace II Society"" (1993, both also co-produced and wrote the story), ""Dead Presidents"" (1995, both also produced and wrote the story) & ""From Hell"" (2001, both also executive produced) is great! The story & screenplay by Gary Whitta is great!

The music by Atticus Ross is great! The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography to ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Contact"" (1997), ""What Lies Beneath"" (2000), ""Cast Away"" (2000), & ""The Polar Express"" (2004), all which were directed by Robert Zemeckis), ""Spider-Man"" (2002), ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (2003), & the upcoming ""Priest"" (2010) is great! The film editing by Cindy Mollo is great! The casting by Mindy Marin (who also did the casting to ""Up In The Air"" (2009), the upcoming ""Tooth Fairy"" (2010) & ""Repo Men"" (2010) is great! The production design by Gae S. Buckley (who also did the production design to ""Open Range"" (2003) is great! The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr (who also did the art direction to ""The Last Samurai"" (2003) is great! The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to ""Devil In A Blue Dress"" (1995, which also starred Washington and Jennifer Beals), ""Antwone Fisher"" (2002), ""The Great Debaters"" (2007), ""Out Of Time"" (2003), all which also starred Washington), ""Ray"" (2004), ""The Pursuit Of Happyness"" (2006), ""Dreamgirls"" (2006) & ""Seven Pounds"" (2008) is great!

This is a great action film that is a little different than other action films. This is a different looking film that people aren't probably used to. Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman are excellent as usual.",1263600000,63,3220,4.918968692449355
4102047,3,B003A8FET6,"One does not usually begin a movie review by talking about the ending, but in the case of ""The Book of Eli,"" there's really no other way to go about it. Something, and I'm trying to be careful here, is revealed, something that's implausible but also undeniably clever. After the revelation, we discover what has been driving the main character to do what he does, and that's when it all come crashing down - this movie goes a long way for very little. How could the Hughes Brothers have let their film be so grossly undermined, especially after giving the audience a thoroughly absorbing buildup? I'm so disappointed. This movie could have been something. Up until the end, it really was something.

The story takes place in a post apocalyptic world of barren landscapes, effectively made to look harsh through a combination of overly bright lighting and muted color schemes. Broken highways trail across vast deserts. Cities lie in ruin. Ancient-looking cars litter the scenery, and some still contain the remains of their drivers. Drought reigns supreme. Everything is scarce, including food. The remaining population consists almost entirely of thieves, and some have even resorted to cannibalism. The reason for all this is left a little obscure; the characters keep referring to a cataclysmic event known as The Flash, which I interpret as being either a meteor or a solar flare. It also could have been manmade - a nuclear bomb, or something.

Wandering across this wasteland is Eli (Denzel Washington), a loner on a mission. He has the fighting skills of an assassin, able to take on groups of people singlehandedly and emerge victorious, even when chainsaws and machineguns are involved. He seems astutely aware of his surroundings, and his sense of hearing is unbelievably strong. He has lightning-quick reflexes, as if somehow seeing everything before it actually happens. But he never makes it his business to fight; he's just trying to head west. He has been for the last thirty years, ever since The Flash took place. What exactly is waiting for him there? He's remains mum on the subject. I can't help but love it when the Mysterious Stranger lives up to his name.

He makes a pit stop in a ramshackle town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a wholly deplorable man who sends his flunkies out in search of a very specific book. No power on earth will make me reveal exactly what book it is. I will say that Eli just happens to be in possession of such a book and that, because of a social uprising soon after The Flash, it's the last of its kind. As a result, a select few know of its existence. Eli wants the book because he believes it will be the key to humanity's redemption. Carnegie wants the book because he can use it as a weapon. When all is explained at the end, we realize with great disillusionment that Carnegie's motives make a reasonable argument for why this book should have remained forgotten.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Eli bonds with Solara (Mila Kunis), daughter of Claudia (Jennifer Beals), Carnegie's blind concubine. Not much is known about Solara; the most we get is that, like many who were born after The Flash, she never learned how to read. But it's not really about getting to know her, anyway; it's about her relationship with Eli, the way she questions him about life before The Flash, why he's so intent on heading west, and whether or not he can teach her how to read. Eli is alarmingly unresponsive on the subject of reading, and we don't understand why until the end.

And that brings me back to where I started. A mystery is only as good as its solution; if what leads up to the ending is better than the actual ending, you've failed at telling a successful story. The big revelation at the end of ""The Book of Eli"" is immensely unsatisfying, not only because it sends a message that contradicts certain events of the story, but also because it lacks the inventiveness and scope of the film's opening and middle sections. It was a bait and switch. I felt cheated.

All the same, there are many recommendable things about this movie. The buildup is carefully structured and wonderfully paced. The visuals are stunning. The dialogue is decent. The performances are good, especially Oldman's. It's just the ending that's bad. This is a strange situation. I'm urging you to avoid ""The Book of Eli,"" but because my review has been so vague, seeing it may be the only way for you to understand where I'm coming from. I really wanted to like this film. Up until the final five minutes, I did like it very much. So maybe it would be worth your while to go and then leave before everything is revealed. In this case, that would not be a waste of money. Trust me on this one.",1263513600,3,4719,4.665865384615385
4102048,4,B003A8FET6,"The post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go.  I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.  Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.  Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.",1263513600,105,1767,4.811258278145695
