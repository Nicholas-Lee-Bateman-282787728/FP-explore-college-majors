3679471,1,B001L4L96I,"Just in case you missed it (as I did): THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FILM ANDERSON PLATOON AS MADE AND SEEN IN 1967. Entirely my own fault. Caveat Emptor and all that. The DVD is clearly labelled as being BASED ON a film by Pierre Schoendoerffer. This is a 1980s re-dub of the original 1967 film, which has been poorly tele-cined, re-scored and re-presented as a new film - and the DVD box actually tells you what it is. As an item in itself, the quality of the image of the original film is poor. There is an electronic 1980s score and a new narration. The original soundtrack and narration is not there at all. This is not usable if you wish to see the original film. The product is actually labelled correctly, so I am in no way saying there's anything untoward about it, but it's easy to miss the fact that you are buying a 1980s redub, not the original film.",1329868800,,858,4.269938650306749
3679472,1,B001L4L96I,"I also agree with those dissapointed by the reworked narration of this film. This is a totally different film with a far weaker impact than the director's original, English language narration.",1324339200,,192,5.225806451612903
3679473,5,B001L4L96I,"This is a very unusual documentary.  The naration is minimal, almost nothing is explained.  THere are long sequences of time in which nothing happens - just guys eating from their mess kits or marching through a stream, or salvaging a damaged helicopter.  After a few desultory episodes, the film ends in a set-piece combat drop, heavy fighting.  The camera captures the sweat, fear, and wounds of these very young soldiers.

I found it real, unsentimental, no political ax to grind.  Just boredom, fear, and death - and one moment of utter courage under fire.  No slow-mo, no music.  Just a dirty, brave man facing death.  It's as close to real combat as I ever hope to get.",1318896000,,675,4.700854700854701
3679474,1,B001L4L96I,I agree with the first reviewer. This is a travesty of the original film and an insult to the actual director. The VHS version is much better. It is a shame the Schoendoerffer Collection is not avail;able inthe USA with English subtitles. It is execrabl;e on all levels.,1315699200,,270,4.645833333333333
3679475,1,B001L4L96I,"I have to be honest, it was all that I could do to sit through this updated video. The narrator should have simply used the original words of the French producer. Instead, it is full of PC crap. Why point out that this platoon is unique because the Platoon Leader is a black West Pointer? Duh! Who's not going to pick up on that? In the original, they simply showed him and stated the fact. Then they go into the platoon having Blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics! Duh, again. Anyone with eyes can see that. It seems strange that they didn't mention that it also contained Whites. One of the things that made the original video so forceful was the narrator telling us at the beginning who was destined to be killed and wounded. Instead, it was left out for the PC stuff that modern documentaries think must be in there. One thing that really struck me in the original was the French director admitting that the war was started by France. An important point, left out in the updated version. Add to that, the switching around of scenes and the long lack of any narrative at some points and you get a pale imitation of the original award winning documentary. Don't take my word for it, watch the original on You Tube and then watch this lame-o version. My advice, stay away from this one unless you can't find one of the originals.",1260921600,,1333,4.467213114754099
3679476,5,B001L4L96I,"This moving documentary shows what war it truly like - the long periods of boredom broken by short bursts of total fear, the pain of losing a comrade, the loneliness and the camaraderie that comes with being a fighting man.  An excellent commentary on the effects of war on America's youth.",1240790400,,290,4.686274509803922

8317294,1,B001L4L96I,I was Joe Anderson's replacement in B/1/12. Prior to its release the director came back to RVN and showed the finished product to the platoon. Years later I ran into Joe when we both worked at GM where gave me a VHS copy of the original. This product shares the title and some of the footage with the original and that is all.  Don't waste your money or credibility on it.,1471305600,,372,4.23943661971831

8317298,5,B001L4L96I,I read about this documentary in a book called Bloods.  I could identify with these troops having served myself.  Another good documentary that tells the soldier's story.,1396224000,,170,5.2592592592592595
8317299,5,B001L4L96I,"This one is a favorite of my Vietnam-war-veteran husband. It is a more accurate depiction of the circumstances of the soldiers than most, which is important to a vet. Also, it is told in a way that reminds me of the news coverage at the time. We watch it maybe once a year.",1393113600,,273,4.169811320754717
