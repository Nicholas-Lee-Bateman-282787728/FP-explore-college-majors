8602521,5,B004DK4J4G,"These early silents are about 100 years old, but they are fascinating for a variety of reasons. First, His Majesty The Scarecrow of Oz is actually directed by L. Frank Baum, the famed author of the line of Oz stories! Also, some of the early special effects must have been quite advanced for their time. For instance, when the witch Mombi freezes Gloria's heart, it's done by a clever series of dissolves. Also, one can see that these films did have some influence on the 1939 Wizard of Oz in terms of costumes, set design, etc.. Although there are some glitches and scratches, it's amazing how clear these films are given there age. Oddly, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the most famous story, is a short 13 minutes. I suppose this might have something to do with the fact that this movie is 4 years earlier (1910) than the other films. I thing they tried to make up for this in the longer (59 minutes) His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz, as it follows several of the W.W.O.O. plot points, the Wizard,the Tin Man, The Lion and Dorothy are all present. The most different tale is The Patchwork Girl of Oz, which has mostly new characters, except for the Wizard of Oz, The Scarecrow, and briefly the Lion (Played by Hal Roach!).All in all, a must for any Wizard of Oz fan.",1290729600,2,1265,4.456896551724138
