8180156,2,B000NOC5YW,"Having read virtually all of the Spenser novels, I was really looking forward to this movie. What a disappointment! It was just LAME! Maybe it's just my imagination, but none of these actors came even close to matching what I expected. I wouldn't even call this a ""B"" movie adaption of the books, but maybe a ""D"" version.",1315353600,,321,4.551724137931035
