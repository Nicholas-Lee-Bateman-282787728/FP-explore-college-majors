8708222,3,B00USZC0O6,"Action packed period Korean drama with great subtitles. However, the first disc skipped, slowed down and couldn't be watched. Missing several episodes is making the story hard to follow. Watching the second disc and it's fine so far. Hope the rest of the discs don't have this skipping problem.",1488585600,,294,5.020408163265306
