8047285,5,B0007GP7E6,"Ripper 2 is a pretty good attempt at delivering quality suspense, and the flaws are honestly short and completely bearable so they never actually interfere with the quality of the storyline.

It's about a psychotic and attractive teenage girl (played by Erin Karplunk) who stays inside a mental institution as part of an experiment to try and fix her problems through testing studies.  These studies involve looking into her brain for answers and constantly putting her in a dream-like state.

Eventually she's introduced to other people her age who have their own distinct and dangerous problems, and these people happen to be staying in the same building as the girl.  The storyline really changes as soon as these characters enter the picture and the focus being exclusively on Erin Karplunk's character suddenly stops, and the rest of the gang gets their own amount of attention... at least, for the time being.  Eventually it goes back to the original theme involving the teenage girl.

Anyway, a Jack the Ripper evil monster is roaming, not only the streets, but the entire mental institution killing the teens in ways that make you think ""Is he REALLY killing them or is it all in the imagination of the teenage girls head?""  That's the question.  It's an interesting storyline though because it really takes advantage of the suspense and has you guessing constantly what's real and what's not.

The violence is pretty good too- plentiful and disturbing.

Sure, there's some pointless nonsense involving an adult dance club scene to name one example, but other than that, I can't really find any faults with Ripper 2.  Worth watching.",1289260800,2,1641,4.9963235294117645
8047286,1,B0007GP7E6,"I bought a used DVD that was advertised in very good shape. Well I got the DVD & the case had a hole in it and the plastic covering the paper insert(DVD Front title page & back page with synopsis & credits) was ripped as was the cover page. The DVD itself would not play and after further inspection had a indention in it like someone stabbed it. The dvd also had several major scratches along with a plethora of smaller ones. The DVD also had a sticky substance on it that caused me to have to clean my dvd lens 3 times to get clean. I keep my dvd player's lens very clean so this was very unusual. I returned the DVD with a note but as of two weeks ago I still haven't heard a word from ALL MEDIA, even though I sent it return receipt requested so I have verification they have had it for 11 days. I have ordered a lot of used DVDs & when most rate them very good then they are but I will not oder again from this outfit because I feel they didn't even look at DVD prior to sending. I will change review if they make it right.",1260921600,,1028,3.9471153846153846
8047287,3,B0007GP7E6,"Liked the first Ripper fim (Ripper letter from Hell)best.
Coudn't get ""Ripper 2 letter from within"" in my own country,although it was on cable in Australia. The movie was fine although I didn't like the heavy sex scenes in the middle of the movie.",1215475200,4,247,4.636363636363637
8047288,1,B0007GP7E6,"I saw Ripper I and don't remember a whole lot about it, so in going into RIPPER 2, I was a little leary about what to expect.  If you haven't seen the first Ripper, this one will probably be confusing anyway.  A different actress takes over the role of Molly and there's so much plot twisting and lack of cohesion that this movie is merely a dull waste of time.  The trend of overabundant lesbian sex is once again used as padding and the murders are staged so haphazardly no terror is induced.  The acting by all is really pretty bad.  Let's hope we don't have a RIPPER 3, although its ambiguous ending suggests we might be burdened with it.  This reviewer will not go for a third run though!",1131926400,6,693,4.292307692307692
