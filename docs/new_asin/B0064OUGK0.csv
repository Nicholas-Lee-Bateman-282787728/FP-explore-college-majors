4952587,5,B0064OUGK0,Johnny Depp plays the role of Paul Kemp a journalist who travels to San Juan. Kemp fit's right in with his cronies as a hard drinking journalist. Johnny Depp stays true to the book by his friend Hunter S. Thompson. Lot's of laughs. I found it to be the funnest movie I've seen in many years.,1322697600,2,291,4.214285714285714
4952588,2,B0064OUGK0,"Not sure what to make of this film.  Depp is usually very good in these sorts of obscure film roles but, in this film, it seemed like he was not all there.  Perhaps, this was the idea, or it can just be attributable to the absence of any real plot.

Okay, there was a lot of drinking but the drinking emphasis was so affected that it lost all sense of reality.  So, maybe this was supposed to be the point.  Again, I'm not sure what the hell to make of this film.

When it was boiled down, you got Depp as a drunk writer, other drunk writers in need of a shower and shave, a real estate developer (who is the ""bad guy""), a sex-craved blonde bimbo, cock fights, acid trips, and some sort of newspaper that suddenly crumbles (around 30 minutes after my patience did at sitting through the film--although I did gut it out to the credits).

Perhaps, I missed something with this film.  Or, perhaps, I got what I was supposed to get and just did not ""get it.""

Like I said, I am not sure what to make of this movie other than I would not pay to see it again (and would likely ask for a refund if I could).",1320710400,,1100,4.079069767441861
4952589,5,B0064OUGK0,"Johnny Depp plays Paul Kemp, a New Yorker hired to work at a newspaper in San Juan (1960). The paper is going down hill. The editor, Richard Jenkins, wants new blood, even though Paul appears to be everything he doesn't want in an employee. There is unrest outside, but no one at the newspaper knows what is going on. The humor is fast and witty. The man Paul is replacing was ""artistic"" and ""raped to death"" by sailors.

Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone. He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing. He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up. He describes the obese Yankee tourists as ""great whites"" the most deadly creature known to man. They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping. The more you spend, the more you save. His writings tend to be cynical.

Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief. Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional. There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, ""Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal.""  While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because ""I do horoscopes."" The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson. A local proclaims, ""This country was founded on genocide and slavery...then they brought in Jesus like a bar of soap.""

The movie is also critical of the dummy-down media who kills stories so as to not offend their advertisers. In the film, capitalism is destroying Puerto Rico, creating a war of haves vs. have-nots while Cuba turns to communism. A rich man claims, ""Liberals are college educated communists with Negro thoughts."" To them the problem with the world is the communists. The movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.

Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.

The movie is not all political. Just as you think Paul has reached bottom, he discovers ""a drug so powerful that the FBI gives it to communists."" NOTE: LSD in liquid form, administered to the eye should be done in split drops with three full drops being way too much, possibly causing hallucinations...or so I've been told.

Good acting, good script, funny and very entertaining. Staunch conservatives might be critical of the leftist views contained in this Hollywood film. A must view for Hunter S. Thompson fans.

F-bomb, excessive drinking, drug use. Was that Amber topless is a dimly lit love scene?",1320537600,16,2729,4.791489361702127
4952590,5,B0064OUGK0,"This was a pretty good movie. Lot's of laughs from the audience, I would say, said it all. Depp is a young, somewhat New York type that flies down to Puerto Rico to work for a paper. He displays a kind of innocence not knowing what to the expect to find at the newspaper he's gone there to work for. Yes everybody else is a wilder character than he is because they've been there a lot longer and are more in tune with the underworld of the country. He gave the impression that whatever he experienced in New York wasn't anywhere near any type of preparation for what he was about to experience in Puerto Rico.

I've been thrown into situations like this myself and he did exactly what I would have done. You don't wanna piss off the locals or the people you meet because you don't know what they're capable of especially when they display such unbridled, manic behaviors. So Depp played it low key not knowing what to expect. If you want to find out where the footing is, you listen to the rhythm, understand the beat before you join in and Depp didn't know where exactly his footing might end up. You do that if you're not sure of what to do or say next. You don't wanna end up in an alley with a shiv in your back. So you let others take the lead since they seem to know the layout and know what to do and not what to do and who to do it with. He hadn't been there long enough as an explorer to live with the natives and wear the grass skirt.

The supporting cast was much more animated than Depp was but the reasons I gave above is why. You're a guy in a strange country with a whole lot of whacky, crazy people on one side and because you seem 'On The Level' more so than the others on the island, you get invited to play with the rich in a scheme that the ragtag characters at the news paper could never get invited to. That's why the guys at the paper were never invited. If Depp had been a more worn, torn older drunk like the news paper guys he would have never been invited to play with the rich and the story would have had to revolve around the newspaper guys ... which in retrospect would have been a great story also. But it wasn't what Hunter wrote. This was more of a story about a guy in the middle trying not to get dragged down to the bottom and going there quickly but wanting to play with the rich without losing his sense of honest play either.

I felt the characters were well divided up from the top of the cream (the rich), to the middle (Depp) and the swill at the bottom (the paper characters). I do have to say Ribisi was great as always. This is an actor that plays a character part so well he'll go down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest character actors along with Steve Buscemi.

This is a movie where everything fit. A young guy who was thrusted into an environment that he didn't really fit into, then the guys who were well worn, wanting out but couldn't find their way out so they just got numb to it all and found ways to cope, to the rich guys going there to find huge profits.

The score was well picked also. Kudos Depp.",1320192000,9,3069,4.134003350083752
4952591,2,B0064OUGK0,"I could describe the film The Rum Diary as a cinematic bipolar disorder that ignites a collective audience attention deficit disorder as your mind drifts to wonder what else is playing on the other screens in this theatre that I could justify already spending my 40 bucks for me and my date (and that's even sharing one popcorn, one soda and one box of junior mints).

Having read the The Rum Diary, albeit years ago, I had extremely low expectations for this film.  It being one of Hunter's earliest works, he was only just beginning to find his voice, rhythm and style.  Yet the book is worth reading as it marks his writing with a promising sign of the amazing work to come.  So upon hearing that Hollywood would be attempting an adaptation, I thought...omg, why?  Not only did I think there was not enough in the book to make much of a cinematic journey (or story) but also I had the gut feeling the film would fall short of it.  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Terry Gilliam is about as good as it's going to get (as Thompson was still around to make sure of it).

Hunter S. Thompson the man was bigger than life, an amazing character already...can't touch him...and his writing is the man's mind, heart and soul on paper, so you can't touch that.  Your best bet is to watch him in the documentary Breakfast with Hunter by Wayne Ewing (I own it and show it to my students each semester).  In the doc, you see him, hear him, and know that if he was around to see this film he'd meet and greet audiences with either his shotgun or fire extinguisher (not to mention the god-awful things he would do to the studio).
Other than that, I recommend reading the words he wrote on the page.  Your own imagination will fill in any gaps better than Hollywood ever could despite the excellent performances by its cast.  Nevertheless, as I tell my filmmaking students, seeing the bad movies have value as you learn what not to do.

I rate it with a ""rent it"" sign.

4952592,2,B0064OUGK0,"The Rum Diary was hugely anticipated on my part for quite some time now. As a fairly big fan of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, I was more than a little excited to see Johnny Depp jump into the shoes of Hunter S. Thompson once again. But there were a few snags along the way. For one, the film has been sitting on the shelf for over a year. We also didn't have any sort of trailer, TV spot, or even production images until a few months ago. We had a summary and a rather impressive looking cast to fall back on. Part of me knew this wouldn't be quite as gonzo or extreme as Fear and Loathing, but an even bigger part of me really wanted it to be. In the end, it just wasn't meant to be and The Rum Diary is just barely on the better side of decent.

Hunter S. Thompson took on several different personas over the years in his writing. Regarding the film adaptations of his works, Raoul Duke, who Depp portrayed in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the man Paul Kemp, who Depp portrays in The Rum Diary, eventually becomes. So it's kind of obvious from the start that The Rum Diary won't be as erratic as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In 1960, Paul Kemp goes to Puerto Rico to write for The San Juan Star and meets Bob Salas (Michael Rispoli) the newspaper photographer and Edward J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) the editor. In addition to Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), who has pretty much drank away the majority of his life. While Kemp struggles to write a story Lotterman is happy with, he begins to pal around with Bob and eventually runs into Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a man who knows how to make money on an island that doesn't seem to have any. Kemp gets into a few business discussions with Sanderson and falls in love with Sanderson's girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard). Writing becomes the least of Kemp's problems as he struggles with an overbearing alcohol addiction, a domineering urge for lust, and the unfathomable ways he finds himself getting in over his head in nearly every situation.

I feel like Johnny Depp has lost whatever it was that made him interesting years ago since I haven't particularly cared for one of his live-action films in years. Blinded by pirates and consistently working with a particular gothic director from Burbank, California, Depp has been stumbling around in mediocre territory for quite some time now. I was hoping he'd at least show shades of his performance in Fear and Loathing and I suppose he did. Paul Kemp was a man who's much more together than Raoul Duke was though. His mind isn't quite as polluted with mind-altering substances as Duke's was. Depp is obviously tapping into the same character and seems to do what he can with the role, but it isn't really a noteworthy performance. Giovanni Ribisi felt like he stood out much more, but that was more than likely the purpose. Moberg is the most interesting and laugh-out-loud character of the film. He's so far gone that a simple intoxicated hand gesture or head movement speaks volumes of his character. While The Rum Diary attempts to be its own film, the eyedropper scene is probably the closest you'll get to Fear and Loathing nostalgia.

Unfortunately, the movie felt like it didn't really find its footing until its second half. Upon seeing Fear and Loathing, Thompson was quoted as saying that the film would have been nothing more than ""a series of wild scenes"" without Depp's narration. That's one of The Rum Diary's biggest problems. While we do hear the inner thoughts of Kemp while he's writing or while staring into a lobster tank, The Rum Diary feels like a hackneyed series of crazy events strung together. It could best be described as quirky or semi-eccentric up until the cock fights begin, but it feels rather ho-hum in its execution. Bob Salas looks, sounds, and acts like a watered down version of Dr. Gonzo. There are all of these wild and bizarre occurrences happening around every turn and about two dozen memorable one-liners being spewed like wildfire, but no performance really sticks out above the rest and you seem to be just along for the ride rather than being sucked into it. The Rum Diary almost comes off like a watered down version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

The Rum Diary is full of Johnny Depp breathing fire, voodoo, countless laws being broken, hangovers, riots, alcohol, and chicken, but it's all wrapped up in really dull packaging. There's some good writing in there; some that spoke to me as a writer. Its mundane line delivery is nearly forgotten about in its second half where things pick up and are borderline hilarious, but everything good going for the movie is forgotten about in its extremely disappointing ending. Considering all of its flaws, issues, and miscues, the logical side of me is wishing The Rum Diary would have stayed on the shelf.",1319932800,4,4808,4.63305978898007

4952638,1,B0064OUGK0,"...and the film was no improvement at all. Mind you, I have immensely enjoyed a number of Thompson's books, but ""Rum Diary"" was one of his earlier efforts (and a fictional one at that) and if memory serves, he wrote it under a pen name. Either way, it fell flat and is one of those publishings that makes sense for a person like Thompson to release after he's already had a number of successes because his established fanbase will most certainly be drawn in -- I was, anyway.
I read ""The Rum Diary"" close to 15 years ago and I found it to be meandering, pointless and the attempts at humor fell flat. On that note, the film is right on-par with the book. What I found to be quite sad about this, is that there are actually quite a few opportunities for a funny film with the provided framework. Unfortunately, these opportunities were wasted as the film stuck closer to the novel than it really needed to.
""Fear and Loathing On the Campaign Trail"" and ""Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"" were remarkably-terrific books that were made into equally poignant and entertaining films (""Campaign Trail"" being made into ""Where the Buffalo Roam"").
""Rum Diary"" unfortunately has no point to it. Kemp takes a job at a dead end newspaper in Puerto Rico and almost immediately regrets it, clashes with his boss and happens to lock eyes with a spoiled, entitled ""princess"" who is engaged to a businessman (Sanderson) who wants to develop and exploit parts of the island. Kemp is a fall-down-drunk and yet Sanderson sees some writing potential in him and draws Kemp into the inner circle of the land deal? It didn't work in book form, nor does it work on film. However, there's plenty of room for hijinx and hilarity, yet the film falls flat as Kemp constantly gets into some the most UNfunny situations, including getting chased by a pissed-off cantina owner, ending in a courtroom appearance. Think of the possibilities for that and it came-off about as funny as ""Remains of the Day.""",1466553600,,1969,4.644699140401146

4952689,2,B0064OUGK0,"The Rum Diary
 I am a great fan of Jonny Depp, in the proper vehicle.  I am also a fan of Hunter S. Thompson, Doctor of Gonzo Journalism, from whose original novel this film is adapted.  This should have been a home run, with Depp returning to familiar if terminally weird territory.  Depp played the protagonist in the most famous of Thompsons works, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the result of the amazing acting by Depp and the fearsomely twisted tale by Thompson was spectacular.  The fault is not to be put on the actor for this infield fly of a film.  The Rum Diary was Thompsons first novel.  There is even a line in the film when the young would be novelist explains that he hasn't yet found his voice, that he doesnt quite know how to write like himself.  Sadly, that will be the epitaph for the film.
  But we have the premonition of Dr. Gonzos future greatness.  There is a hermaphrodite Voodoo priest (priestess?) as a minor character.  Set in Porto Rico in 1960 we have the young writer trying to find himself while trying to squeeze out a living in a doomed tropical newspaper.  He becomes involved with a brash hustler (very well played by Aaron Eckhart in a role that will do him great credit, even if the movie itself tanks) who is not loath to stoop to any foul connivance to make his deal for a new hotel come to fruition.  There is a Nazi sympathizer, a penniless drunk who enthusiastic quaffs rum so powerful that it could be properly considered rocket fuel.  Long time character actor Giovanni Ribisi nails this role to an absolute Tee.  Even if you do not remember his name, his face will be familiar to movie goers.  This is three for three, Depp, Eckhart and Ribisi, in really good performances.
 To make it four for four, let us add Amber Heard as the love interest.  At only 23 Ms. Heard has a string of roles on her resume, but this is her first time out as the female lead.  She is gorgeous, which has nothing to do with her acting but must be noted.  She occupies the character of the vile hustlers girlfriend.  She is willful, sensual and knows how to make men do whatever comes into her brain to get them to do.  She is highly wound, like a clockwork automaton of sex and beauty.  The clockwork comes spectacularly apart in a nightclub in St. Thomas one night where the principles go to party.  This is one of the best scenes in the film.
 Great acting and interesting, not to say weird, characters are the films strong points.  The weakest part of the movie is the premise.  We are to become attached to the young writer, to root for him to overcome the real estate hustler, to find his muse and get the girl.  The problem is that the young writer is not worth our time.  When we meet him, he is immersed in lies to cover up his alcoholism.  When we leave him, he is in the midst of a major property theft.  In between, he savagely critiques others for their moral lapses and does nothing whatever to remedy his own.  He cannot rescue the girl, the knockout-beautiful mermaid of his dreams, from her own folly, in part because he is too weakwilled to take charge and in part because he is too booze addled to do anything very well.  This is our hero, the good guy that we want to succeed.
 We just don't care, at least I didnt.
 There is one clunker in the dialog where a Marine officer identifies incoming naval gunfire as twelve inch rifles.  No Marine officer would make such a mistake (no such weapon existed in 1960).  We neither expect nor can we blithely overlook such poor editing in a serious film.
 Writer/director Bruce Robinson must take the heat for the clunker but the flawed story is all on Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.  Although Robinson has not directed a film in 19 years, he is a very accomplished writer.  He penned The Killing Fields and Jennifer 8 among many other worthy films.  Even his talents could not rescue The Rum Diary from its own flaws.
 It is possible to have a horrible person and a destructive alcoholic be a sympathetic character.  Jeff Bridges recently show us how in Crazy Heart.  The Rum Diary is not remotely in this league.  It can muster only a sub-par two and a half saw blades for the two hour, R rated effort.  Somehow they used up $45 million to make this not quite good enough film.  It has brought in $21 million so far and might a profit eventually.  I had hoped for better, and so did Depp, one of the producers.",1429315200,,4396,4.374536464771323

4952738,4,B0064OUGK0,"Overall the movie was enjoyable but I find the director was more impressed with style than he was with substance. I read Hunter S. Thompsons book years ago and the movie keeps mostly to the plot but takes quite a few creative liberties as it comes to Chenaults part. Kemp is an alcoholic newspaper writer and gets a job in Puerto Rico because no other paper would hire him on account of his drinking. Depp plays the role of the major lush and does a credible job of it but mainly he seems to have dusted off the character he playes in Fear and Loathing. The book I recalled was quite a bit morose than the movie makes of the whole experience and has an upbeat, devil may care joie de vivre. Chenault is a beautiful maven that is the girlfriend of Sanderson, a speculator that wants to hire Depp for some writing gigs. In the book she is swept away from Carnivale and ends up raped by the denizens at the club. The movie just leaves Kemp separated from her and they reunite at the end and she goes back home: a much gentler conclusion to the romance. The movie illustrates the plight of Puerto Ricans when rich Americans want to take over everywhere. The struggles of free newspaper during that time period and the availability of cheap fun to be had if you are a witty alcohol writer. Its not a deep story but stylistically its quite beautiful.",1392595200,,1344,4.38

I am sure a lot of people didn't like it because of the inferences of drug and alcohol abuse, which I am sure many people would feel this film somewhat glamourized, but like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Depp has a way of portraying someone in the grips of drugs or alcohol like no other actor can do as well. So many of the scenes in this movie are just laugh out loud hysterical and Depp's affinity for Hunter Thompson's work rings out loud and clear.

Just remember, Don't Attempt Any of This At Home, the average journalist's liver is a thing of legend to be able to handle that much alcohol and still somehow function the next day.

4952750,3,B0064OUGK0,"This film works in ways that aren't readily apparent.

Not a big fan of Depp's (great in Chocolat), but what he does well here is register the lunacy of the situation, topped with rum, and the dilemma: whether to take the high road or the low when the difference in heights isn't that great, as his boss points out. Depp also conveys well his character's understanding that this stint in Puerto Rico is destined to become One of Those Experiences.

The real strength of the film, though, is in the newsroom scenes, especially the performances of Richard Jenkins, as the editor, and, most especially, Michael Rispoli (is it?) as the photographer. Rispoli's performance is the best newshound portrayal I've ever seen (shades of Kevin Costner playing the laborer in that Boston flick); (for whatever reason getting the newsman right has proven illusive to many a fine actor. Crowe was awful, Streep pretty good, and Marisa Tomei very good); and Jenkins' is second-best. He is especially good when nailing Depp as being hungover, his first day on the job.

Solid too is Eckhart. He's the bad guy, but he's not evil. He's just another capitalist, this one smart enough to work in the Caribbean and with an above-average beautiful woman on his arm.

As for Ribisi's performance, it is as usual just that, and whether you like his performances or not will determine whether you like this one.",1380326400,,1385,4.831223628691983
4952751,3,B0064OUGK0,"Now, I didn't have HUGE hopes for this movie, so I wasn't overly disappointed, but neither was I thrilled to discover that it was actually good.  All I can say, it was better than I expected, but still not a movie I ever would have bought or watched if not for Johnny Depp being in it.

""The Rum Diary"" left me with the same feeling that ""Fear and Loathing"" did...hardly a shock, since they both revolve around the same author.  Once again, we are treated to a cynical and drunken (or high) (or both) view of the world, where most things turn out to be pointless.  However, the saving grace of this movie were the spectacular landscapes and the wonderful vintage cars and the beautiful actress who played Chenault, the love interest of the film.  The music was also really good.

Kemp is a big time drinker with a checkered writing career (if you could call being a failed novelist a career) who goes to Puerto Rico to work for an ailing newspaper.  He hooks up with Sala, a photographer for the same paper and ends up rooming with him and his even stranger other roommate who also (sort of) works for the same paper.  He's probably the most oddly intriguing character in the show, though of course you never figure out how he got that way.

What follows is a drunken (or high) ramble through all sorts of misadventures that are sometimes funny and sometimes not, with an occasional nod at a plot revolving around a secret real estate deal.  The gap between the rich who are exploiting the island and the poor is brought up a few times, but nothing really seems to come of it.  Just when you think something might get accomplished, that Kemp is going to take a stand or do SOMETHING other than get in and out of trouble and find the next high...it doesn't.  A lot of the plot seemed pointless.

Again, this reminded me of ""Fear and Loathing,"" where if it wasn't Johnny Depp playing him, with all of his charm, I would so dislike the guy that I probably wouldn't have even finished watching the movie.  Which isn't to say that I hated the movie entirely, but I don't understand this fascination for pointless, essentially plotless writing.

Warning, there is a lot of drug use in the movie (though it does show you what stupid things you can do and get into as a result) and if you would be squicked or offended by chicken-fighting scenes, then you might not want to watch it.",1379635200,,2375,4.452655889145497

I had an oppurtunity to go there around this time frame, but did not think I wanted to be confused as another American who where profiting off the people.
The main reason for the four stars, is for Mr. Deep bringing this story to the screen and DVD it shows a time period that was not covered in news media or film. Also Mr. Deep brings his sense of humor to make some of the ugly goings on a bit more palable.
I have yet to show this to people who have homes in San Juan and in the US as well.

Let me say, the casting was mostly spot on and I feel the people they selected very much matched the characters in the book.  They did a great job in this aspect.

My biggest disappointment comes with the fact that the screen play writers manipulated the plot when that was never the point of the story.  It was a diary or a journal, a collection of thoughts and events in the mans life and it didn't need a central hidden plot.

My second biggest disappointment comes from completely removing Fritz Yeamon from the movie. He had the largest role in the book and merging aspects of his character to suit the manipulated plot really turns me off and I'm sure there are many purists that feel the same way.

The people behind the scenes that worked on this movie, they could have had ""The Breakfast Club"" Meets ""Continental Divide"" but, instead they settled for another average story that will be lost in a sea of average movie.

Now, if you've never read the book, you will probably really like the movie but, if you have, go in with a grain of salt as this is not the same exact story that probably made you want to see the movie in the first place.",1365206400,,1285,4.3070539419087135

His love for Thompson is evident, and his acting chops allow him to portray all the necessary emotions. But while Depp's wide-eyed naivete and self-centered recklessness might be understandable coming from a twenty something, the behavior felt awkward and pathetic in a man nearly 50.

Sure Johnny is they hype, but there's not one character who does not carry their own weight and more, revealing a true to life saga from America's past that's well worth the time and memories it brings.

4952776,3,B0064OUGK0,"Since 2000, Johnny Depp has dominated Hollywood as an actor who fits seamlessly into roles that one would think the characters were written for him specifically.  Of course we are all familiar with the big films such as the POTC franchise, Finding Neverland, and his roles in thee CGI/animated flicks Corpse Bride and Alice in Wonderland.  However, it is some of the smaller, less well-known roles in which Mr. Depp has shown of his acting expertise.  Probably the best one is this adaptation of the book The Rum Diary.  Here, Johnny Depp plays a down-and-out reporter who finds himself in Puerto Rico stumbling from one mishap to another; all the while working on a story to embarrass the ruling class of white American expatriates hiding their wealth on this island.  Through it all, he juggles an illicit romance with the gorgeous Chenault, girlfriend of the island's biggest businessman.  The movie is filled with contrasts in scenery as scenes shift from the urban slums to the tropical beauty of the natural surroundings.  Likewise the dialogue alternates between the drunken complaints of Depp's character, and the polished sales pitches of his antagonist played by Aaron Eckhart.  The soundtrack of the movie is probably the best part, fast, upbeat, tropical with tinges of Caribbean, jazz, African, hip-hop and rock & roll and mixed in.  My primary complaint is the meandering, wondering plot line that often left me bored with the film.  In conclusion, a better than average film that really shows of the skills of Mr. Depp.  However, the story was not to my taste, so I give it 3/5 stars.",1358726400,,1599,4.92910447761194

4952791,4,B0064OUGK0,"First, the production values of the movie are fantastic.  Tremendous detail in the authenticity of everyday objects from 1960.  Fabric, aspirin bottles, and on up.  Very much can put you in the mind of how it was in the early 60's.  Beautiful scenery is a given with it being filmed in Puerto Rico.

I think people forget how unstructured life was then.  Not everyone had phones even in the US, much less the island where the movie takes place.  It is a contrast of the newer businessman, who wishes to structure everything to his benefit, versus how simply unstructured most things were.  The main character, Mr. Kemp (Johnny Depp and he is fabulous) sees this.  Sees the untruth in the vision capitalists are wishing to  produce for their profit.  I mean why do you think the early part focused on bowling alleys and fat US tourists?  Who would come to a tropical island with all the ways your senses can be engaged, to stick to 'safe' bowling alleys?  Is was and is simply ridiculous.

The girlfriend of the guy wishing to build the hotel and make money, Ms. Heard, is a vision of how young vital people simply cannot exist within it.  The scenes at the carnival are terribly important to the dichotomy of the film.  A dichotomy Mr. Kemp is forever embroiled with, stuck in, nailed to ""hanging in the middle"".  Circumstances prevent him from going to the left, and needs pull him (against his will) to the right.  To help the developer who believes ""76% of blacks are controlled from Moscow"".  How can such a wealthy influential man, with such messed up ideas be who he is?  Something is fundamentally wrong there.

Now the movie could have been great, and it wasn't.  It loses its way somewhere, here and there.  Too many distractions of no consequence.  Too many scenes that seem as if they could be cut to no detriment.  Yet doing so would have left an hour long movie.  Still a refreshing alternative to your FX driven action fest of no point whatsoever. Humanity is still important, though messy, unstructured and in need of purpose.",1353888000,,2041,4.631284916201118
4952792,4,B0064OUGK0,"There are preciously few bad Depp films (save the hokey Pirates of the Caribbean sequels) and The Rum Diary is no exception - it's another neat little romp with Depp's offbeat trademark.

Johnny Depp gets into quirky roles better than most actors, and in this, he plays an idealistic journalist in Puerto Rico.  In this brave new world, Depp's character Paul Kemp has to navigate Cold War and US imperialist tendencies of the time while maintaining his sense of moral integrity.

The Rum Diary is enjoyable because you can feel the passion everyone had in making the film.  Set in the 1960s, it has an otherworldly, nostalgic setting that's rare in today's cinema.  It feels like a tribute in some ways to world cinema of that era and the good ol' days of being American.  It's like watching a Graham Greene or Hemingway-esque novel spiked with rum.  I think the people who don't enjoy it just don't get what the film is supposed to be about - and it's hardly complicated.

Rum Diary also has shades of a Coen Brothers film but is far more down to earth.  The cast is brilliant - Aaron Eckhart; Amber Heard (you can practically see Depp falling in love with her onscreen); the seedy Giovanni Ribisi and the hapless Michael Rispoli - all make for an interesting and enjoyable lot of misfits.",1352505600,,1290,4.62280701754386

4952796,5,B0064OUGK0,"Ok we thought it started off very slow. We of an audience of two here...almost gave up within the first half hour. But once it finally pulled itself forward it gained some momentum. Once it started to cause you to smile or laugh and so humorous the Depp bouncing on top of the side kick's lap all the way down the back steps their pathetic car bounced. If you cut it out and showed it as a short take it would be famous. And then there was that feeling that you had seen some of these characters not long before. The tall skinny one bad eye dude, the high pitched cackle of the black witch, the sidekick and even the menacing roommate that brought rum filters to make some sort of odd high octane booze. Hadn't we just seen these people in Pirates? I feel too many people tried to make this film too serious. Once it took off we lost ourselves and went with it and it was pure fun. And whew as we waited for that other shoe to fall...it never really did. I mean we never saw the super ugly happen and there were all sorts of possible uglies. I was afraid half a dozen people might be killed but didn't happen. So except for nod to tragic there was the cock fights but even they were tempered down a bit so most squirmish like myself could get through. But the suspense it might be otherwise also kept you in suspense. I was glad the ride was over but we both enjoyed this movie ride. Will watch it again as a re-run sometime too. I haven't read the writers books it's based on but will be interested in at least his written version of this one. Half the time if you've read the book you hate the movie.

I've held off renting it til now because something about the write-up on the back of the dvd told me I probably wouldn't like it.  Today I figured, what the heck; how bad could it be?

Wow, is this movie bad!  Johnny Depp and Aaron Eckhart must've needed some extra pocket change when they decided to do this movie.  The writing's bad through and through and actually manages to make Depp look like a bad actor.  At least Eckhart was his usual charming self, even with a terrible script.

4952804,1,B0064OUGK0,"Depp used to be my ideal man -- after seeing the Rum Diary -- one of the worst films ever -- I couldn't help thinking about what a dupe he played.  There was the ear to ear grin that made him look like an idiot -- I believe he is trying to hide the fact that he has had a face lift (tragic) and his character was such a simpleton.  There was no basis for the romance that he supposedly had and guess had to marry this girl after her brutal gang rape by the natives.  I felt embarrassed for Depp watching this clinker.

I'm editing my review because I forgot to mention a very important fact.  Before Depp started work on ""Fear and Loathing,"" he spent a month living in Hunter's basement so he could be around Hunter to absorb his quirks and mannerisms.  While Depp was rummaging around in his basement, he found a first draft of ""Rum Diary.""  It was never never finished while Hunter was alive.  Depp insisted that he wanted to do the story so it wasn't even written by Hunter.  While watching the film, I noticed that Depp acted in much the same way he did in ""Fear and Loathing.""

The San Juan Star did in fact exist and many scrupulous characters in the real estate business always abound. The attention to detail with regards to the look and ambiance of early 60's Puerto Rico is dead on. The characters are believable and I remember the local newspapers reporting how friendly and courteous Johnny Depp was with the locals while he was here filming.

4952807,3,B0064OUGK0,"Okay, here is the plot line of the film under review, the adaptation of the late Hunter S.  Thompson's legendary (more later on that) The Rum Diary, straight out of the gate. A young aspiring American writer, of the male persuasion, Paul Kemp, played by Thompson pal Johnny Depp, seeks employment in the newspaper business down in then backwater colonial Puerto Rico in the late cold war red scare early 1960s. Said writer, working to win his spurs and to make a name for himself tries six ways to Sunday to upgrade himself as a professional and the newspaper as well (based on a real the San Juan Star of the time). Oh, and chase a few windmills to right some of the egregious wrongs of this world as the young are prone to do (the major wrong confronting him being  double-triple rip-out of the place by hungry, very hungry real estate developers).  Problems encountered in chasing those windmills: said budding journalist is a bit of a drunk, a bit too close to some ex-pat fellow journalists who gravitated to PR just to be flaky in peace, and a bit too close (but one cannot blame him on this one) to one very hot blonde who happens to be slumming in Puerto Rico just then. But, trust me, one Paul Kemp will straighten that whole thing out, or have us go mad trying.

Sound familiar? Well, for any Hunter Thompson aficionado, and count me as one, hell, any half- aficionado, this plot line is very, very much like the life, the early life of one Hunter S. Thompson. And how would we know?
Well we have read the letters, we have read the Rolling Stone articles, hell we have read Songs of the Doomed and got a taste for snippets of The Rum Diary there. So when viewing this film there was a certain disappointment  (just a little) that this did not turn out to be the great film adaptation of  Hunter Thompson's stab at the great American novel.

And here is where the ""more later"" mentioned above on The Rum Diary comes in. Hunter Thompson, seemingly, spend endless hours as far back as the early 1970s (maybe earlier )trying get this novel published (and in publishable form), and into film form. But here is a case where life (his, his later life anyway) outdid fiction. The ambience of the film seems very dated, very dated indeed in the post-Doctor Gonzo age. For what it is worth this is my ""skinny"" on Thompson's career. He was one of the premier journalists of the last half of the twentieth century but as a novelist he was well behind his heroes Fitzgerald and Hemingway. As for Johnny Depp's performance, well, Johnny Depp knows, knows deep in his bones, how to play off-the wall characters and does a better job, a much better job, here than in his attempt at channeling Hunter Thompson in the film adaptation of  Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.

I guess he was a fan of Hunter Thompson but that's no excuse for this terrible mess.  Depp doesn't even look good here, and that's saying something.

The film showed some promise in the opening scenes:  Puerto Rico in 1960, hot and colorful and those beautiful beaches.  Then there's just enough intrigue with the really bad guy, (played wonderfully by Aaron Eckart) and his really hot girlfriend who is obviously looking for trouble wherever she can find it....But it soon lapses into a really sophomoric, self indulgent tirade of the Good Guys, who get constantly wiped out on rum and drugs, vs. the Bad Guys.  The Depp character, who is obviously based on Thompson, is supposed to be The Voice of Righteousness fighting against the Bastards of the world.  He recites lines from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and quotes Oscar Wilde to let us know how thoughtful he really is...when he isn't drunk. He tries to save the paper because the editor who is one of the Bad guys has left....etc..and we're supposed to cheer on his heroic act.  By this time I've long since cared about the guy.  Depp is so bad in this role...I'm amazed!  It's possible that another actor could really pull it off and make us believe this guy and care about him, but Depp is just pasty faced, bland and  (I hate to say it)...pudgy.  yuk.  We're supposed to cheer as he sails off in a stolen sailboat to some stirring music...and cheer some more as the words on the screen say that he made it to New York where he married the hot chick and became a successful journalist.

4952823,5,B0064OUGK0,"A big commercial flop, this intelligent comedy was dismissed by the critics and ignored by the public, and yet I must say that I quite enjoyed it. It is based on a novel of the same name by the late journalist Hunter Thompson. Johhny Depp stars as Paul Kemp, an alter ego of  Thompson (Depp had already played a character based on Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).

Set in 1960, as the movie begins we see Kemp arriving in Puerto Rico in an alcoholic haze. After an interview with Lotterman, its editor, Kemp gets a job in an English language newspaper there that has seen better days. Kemp becomes pal with two other alcoholic reporters in the paper, the crazy Moberg and the cynical Sala. These three are soon living together in a decrepit house in San Juan and are involved in a series of humorous adventures. The closest thing this movie has to a regular plot is when Kemp is contacted by Sanderson, an enigmatic businessman (Aaron Eckhart, who is great). Sanderson introduces Kemp to various businessmen and politicians and wants to recruit him to write a puff job in the paper so that an island that serves as practice range for the military would be available for the construction of hotels. Sanderson has a very pretty girlfriend, Chenault (Amber Heard), who soon tries to seduce Kemp. Kemp eventually wants to write about the various corrupt plots he learns in the newspaper, but he is vetted the very cynical Lotterman, who doesn't want to rock the place, and instead thinks the newspaper should do soft pieces.

I'm not telling anything more about the movie, but it makes for a pretty entertaining film. It's intriguing to me that this film was not well received, perhaps for some it has too broad a style for a comedy, given the subject matter.

This is hands down the worst performance I've seen given by Johnny Depp.  The character he's playing, a besotted writer, should be edgy but Depp renders him as harmless as Bozo the Clown.  The good points of ""The Rum Diary"", few that they are, are Richard Jenkins turn as Depp's harried editor, breathtaking Puerto Rico ambience circa 1960, and Amber Heard for just being a dish.

4952830,5,B0064OUGK0,"When this movie came out, everyone read the names ""Hunter S Thompson"" and ""Johnny Depp"" and immediately expected a wild fun adventure such as ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". Well, it isn't. It is a better movie. Though it is cruel to compare the two movies, both brilliant in their own genres, this one is a better mainstream cinema.

The movie begins with the protagonist played by Depp waking up with a hangover in Puerto Rico hotel. He is there for a job as a journalist and he is late. He is habitually late throughout the movie which could be taken as a metaphor in its own way. The decadence of a nation, while the rich get richer and tear down more truths to establish a mafia of real estate barons.

Depp's character is brilliant as always. Like all his films he brings a lot to this one too. Makes the character living breathing personality that will make you stand and cheer. He is in a new job in an old newspaper which seems to be on the verge of going out of business. Depp meets interesting people. The photographer and the crime reporter are brilliantly played by talented actors. The whole atmosphere of dread and celebration is there for you to witness. Dread and desperation for many poverty stricken bitter people. Celebrations for a handful of rich elite. Enter Eckhart as the big player making things possible for his criminal associates. He wants to hire Depp's skills. Helps out Depp when he is in trouble. Depp follows the events as if in a daze. He just goes with the flow. Even falls hard for Eckhart's girl. Yet he is a gentleman throughout. He single-handedly keeps the flame of righteous journalism burning. Alas, no one gives a damn.

The movie is a lot closer to the chaos of ""The Tailor of Panama"" than to Depp's previous turn as a junkie journalist in ""Fear and Loathing..."", and you have to enjoy the story rather than compare things with Hunter S Thompson's original works.

Apart from the leading cast, the best thing to look forward to is the music by Christopher Young. If you bought this DVD and liked it, I am sure you will be tempted to go out and buy the Original Sound Track of this motion picture too.

There is not a single dull moment in the lives of these mesmerising characters. The rum, the locals, the beatup car, the woman, the job, the jail, the parties, the cockfights, the drunken dialogue, the entire set and visuals, it is all a thrill to watch.

Sala and Moberg provide the requisite odd balls for Kemp to play off.

4952836,5,B0064OUGK0,"Johnny Depp plays Paul Kemp, a New Yorker hired to work at a newspaper in San Juan (1960). The paper is going down hill. The editor, Richard Jenkins, wants new blood, even though Paul appears to be everything he doesn't want in an employee. There is unrest outside, but no one at the newspaper knows what is going on. The humor is fast and witty. The man Paul is replacing was ""artistic"" and ""raped to death"" by sailors.

Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone. He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing. He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up. He describes the obese Yankee tourists as ""great whites"" the most deadly creature known to man. They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping. The more you spend, the more you save. His writings tend to be cynical.

Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief. Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional. There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, ""Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal."" While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because ""I do horoscopes."" The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson. A local proclaims, ""This country was founded on genocide and slavery...then they brought in Jesus like a bar of soap.""

The movie is also critical of the dummy-down media who kills stories so as to not offend their advertisers. In the film, capitalism is destroying Puerto Rico, creating a war of haves vs. have-nots while Cuba turns to communism. A rich man claims, ""Liberals are college educated communists with Negro thoughts."" To them the problem with the world is the communists. The movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.

Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.

The movie is not all political. Just as you think Paul has reached bottom, he discovers ""a drug so powerful that the FBI gives it to communists."" NOTE: LSD in liquid form, administered to the eye should be done in split drops with three full drops being way too much, possibly causing hallucinations...or so I've been told.

This movie is long on venue and period-piece atmosphere, yet utterly lacking in characters who are interesting or plot development that addresses an event or person you might actually care about.

Johnny Depp plays Kemp, a marginal New York journalist and wannabe novelist, who arrives in Puerto Rico to take a position at a struggling San Juan newspaper. He gets caught up in booze, tobacco and drug-addled intrigue in the form of financial shenanigans at his new newspaper, a shady real estate developer (and his intriguing lady friend...and see if you can guess whose bed she ends up in before movie's end), and lingering tensions between the natives and non-natives.

At one point in the movie, Kemp comes within two feet of driving himself and the girlfriend off the end of the road and into the ocean after a high speed run in the real estate developer's Corvette. If only the brakes had faded; a dive into the Caribbean would have saved everybody involved from the remaining hour of misery.

Consider carefully not only the cost of the DVD, but what two hours of your own time is worth before settling down with this disaster.",1333843200,,1236,4.788732394366197
4952840,2,B0064OUGK0,"This movie takes place in 1960 and is based on the Hunter S. Thompson Novel of the same name. Johnny Depp stars as... what's his name. I wish I cared. Anyway, he is a new horoscope writer for the San Juan Star (newspaper in Puerto Rico) with a comedic drinking problem. The last writer was fired for a drinking problem and it seems like almost character in this movie has a drinking problem. Soon after arriving, Johnny gets bumped up a level in the newspaper. He then meets what could loosely be considered the movie's villain, played by Aaron Eckhart who tries to buy up Puente Rican land to build a hotel. For whatever reason he needs to bring in a newspaper reporter to put a positive spin on things. It really seemed like Johnny's role in this master plan wasn't needed, especially for a reporter who has had a week of experience.  There is an undertone of the natural inhabitants of Puerto Rico hating the white people from the US and Johnny is a bystander of this all who gets wrapped into it when Aaron Eckhart threatens the locals and Johnny's best friend in the movie ends up offending a local restaurant employee.

Johnny falls for a beautiful woman that he later finds out is a taken by a powerful man. This is no romantic story, in fact it ultimately seems to go no where. She becomes a key part in let downs that this movie brings. Certain scenes which I feel are very important are just left out. Not sex scenes, but when she comes to Johnny after an important hiatus, he tells his friend give us a few minutes and it is never mentioned afterward. There is no scene in there.

The commercials portray this movie as a comedy and that's what I was expecting. There are moments of comedy and down right hilarity in the movie, but that is equil to about 5 minutes of a 120 minute movie. Most of the comedy comes from Johnny's friend that drives a tiny blue car that doesn't work very well. Somewhere in the movie they end up in a chase scene at night in the little blue car where Johnny ends up using booze and a lighter to keep the chasers at bay. The damsel in this movie also makes for some good comedy when she's out with Johnny for a drive. But really, everything in the commercial is the only comedy there is.

There are some good things though, such as the entire movie takes place in Puerto Rico, so it is colorful, lush, vibrant and beautiful. Scenes of beauty everywhere from crashing waves and bright planes overhead, to lavish jungles to ghettos like the one that Johnny Depp ends up living in.

If you are expecting some ultimate ending where good prevails and everything goes like you'd expect... don't. That's one of the many things that will leave you unfulfilled. Nothing really goes anywhere meaningful in this movie. Such as when Aaron Eckhart yells at Johnny for bringing his friend along to a meeting when Johnny signed a confidentiality agreement... nothing happens. You'd think someone would get killed or end up in litigation... nope. Nothing is ever mentioned again. Maybe that's what you get for expecting something. Toward the end I really felt like you could have fast forwarded the last 20 minutes and not missed anything, which is anti climactic. After all of this, I really can't recommend anyone spend 120 minutes of their life to see this.",1333756800,,3283,4.529510961214165
4952841,4,B0064OUGK0,"Director Bruce Robinson adapted the screenplay from Hunter S. Thompson's eponymous debut novel that was in turn kind of based on some of his own alcohol and drug-fueled experiences in Puerto Rico.  Johnny Depp was a friend of Thompson and vowed to him that they would make the movie.  Depp honored that promise and a director's chair embossed with Thompson's name that held a bottle of Rum on the canvas seat was always on the set.  I enjoyed Depp's somewhat toned down performance, as his character gets embroiled with greedy developers, crooked politics, journalism, and voodoo - oh, there's his dangerous obsession with an entrepreneur's woman.  The movie's heart is really about Thompson finding his unique journalist voice, and this film is a fitting tribute to that and a fine epitaph to him.

Johnny Depp turns in a wonderful performance as Paul Kemp and is joined by an excellent cast who portray their characters just as well.  The beautiful scenery adds to the beauty of the film.  Am glad to own this dvd.,1332979200,,404,4.276315789473684
4952843,3,B0064OUGK0,"Based on an early Hunter S. Thompson novel, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) travels to Puerto Rico to work for a local American run newspaper.  The paper's editor (Richard Jenkins) is a cartoon like character trying to keep the paper running although it is despised by the locals.  The paper shies away from controversial subjects because advertisers don't want to see negativity.  Booze, especially locally made rum, is a character in the film as well.  Paul becomes friends with a newspaper photographer named Sala (Michael Rispoli) and sometime reporter Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) who is in a constant state of inebriation.

Paul is recruited by one of the island's American land developers to prepare a sales promotion document associated with an under-the-table land grab of a small island off the mainland. It had been used for target practice by the U. S. Navy.  The developer (Aaron Eckhart) has a beautiful beach house and a beautiful live-in girlfriend (Amber Heard).  Paul and Chenault (Heard) have eyes for each other but Paul manages to keep his urges under control until events change everyone's relationship.

The movie is at its best when Depp is allowed to take control.  Even when he's not doing all the talking, he remains the film's focus.  There are numerous funny situations and funny lines, but the director/writer Bruce Robinson also meanders into murky political issues, island poverty, racism, bigotry and government sovereignty.  The focus is never clear as to what kind of movie he's making.  As a consequence, the overall result is a mixed bag.  The look of the movie is really excellent.  Whether it is the gorgeous beaches, the `60's glassed-in beach houses or the dilapidated city lofts, they are shot beautifully by Dariusz Wolski.  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention a truly great soundtrack which includes some original music by Christopher Young.

The Blu ray transfer really sparkles.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The movie if full of colorful cars of the period, beautiful blue skies and darker blue oceans and it all looks great.  More than many transfers, this one has a real film quality to it.  Likewise, there are no issues with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 track.  The sound is first rate from the superior soundtrack to the loud club scene to the ambiant noise.

The duo of Depp and Rispoli does well to keep the viewer interested and Robisi as Moberg brings a good humor to the film. Ekhart's Sanderson is terrible however which is made even worse by the fact that Sanderson was one of the most interesting characters in the book. He works at the paper and in the first few chapters is beating protesters with a sign, is fired by Lotterman for threatening to twist off his head, is the main protagonist in the brawl with the restaurant patrons that lands Kemp and Sala in jail in the film, and is one of the participant's in the beating of Lotterman at the end of the novel in which Lotterman is killed.

The film adaption is watered down with key elements that made the book so amazing completely missing. Characters are subbed out for other characters and plot lines get twisted for no reason other than to make the film seemingly incredibly dull. The ending is terrible compared to the brawl, killing of Lotterman and scramble to get out of Puerto Rico by the main characters at the end of the book leaving anyone who's read it scratching their head wondering why the film makers chose to fix something that wasn't broke. The ending credits claim Kemp went back to New York, married Chenault, and became a famous writer, hinting towards the fact that Kemp is Thompson, however Chenault is not mentioned at all after her exit in the book.

4952852,4,B0064OUGK0,"Being a fan of Johnny Depp and the writings of Hunter S. Thompson I was highly anticipating The Rum Diary. I was not deterred by the mixed reviews and was still quite syked to blind buy the Blu-ray on release-day.

The movie is great! It is a lot of fun, smart, and highly entertaining to the right crowd. If you liked the substance of Fear and Loathing you may enjoy this. However if you were simply entertained by the dinosaurs in Fear and Loathing then you may not fully understand what was going on in that film or this one. Rum Diary is based loosely off a true story, yet it is still charming and informative. As other reviews have said, the first half is much more fun, and the second half begins to drive harder on the drama aspect of the story. Over-all I loved the film and was highly entertained. Fans of Thompson or Depp or the rest of the cast should not hesitate to check this one out.

The supporting case also did quite well. I was especially impressed with Giovanni Ribisi and Amber Heard who even in their smaller roles still managed to impress and stand out. Giovanni's character was hilarious and I even found myself re-watching scenes to hear what he said for a chuckle. I never really noticed it in her other roles, but Amber Heard is gorgeous. The movie takes place in the mid-20th century and Heards outfits and style really fit well with her look. She moved up a notch in my book. Michael Rispoli was also very funny and the Depp/Rispoli team was quite entertaining as they went to cock fights and other little adventures. I still remember Michael Rispoli as Spinner in Death to Smoochy though.

The PQ is breathtaking as the scenes of Puerto Rico are so very beautiful and the colors really pop. The image is very consistently sharp, crisp and clear. Even in the dark scenes the image still manages perfect contrast, clarity and depth.

The AQ is very crisp and clean with remarkable dialog as well as music and ambient noises. I was impressed!

Don't listen to the bad reviews and give this movie a chance. I loved it and I am glad I own it as while the movie starts on a fun note and ends in drama, there is a bit of magic in there which will bring me back for many more viewings in the future.",1331510400,,2222,4.37046004842615

4952860,5,B0064OUGK0,"Do not try to pick this movie apart without first realizing exactly what is going on; Johnny Depp, who has done a magnificant turn as Hunter S. Thompson twice before, once as narrator, takes it on again... this time portraying him in 1960 Puerto Rico.  The movie takes most of its material from the Hunter S book of the same name, but rather then try to be really 'based' on the 'Story' (the book itself is more a diary then a story)  it is more about the actors paying homage to the characters as they envision them. Opposed to necessarilly how Hunter S. Thompson portrayed them.
This movie didn't have a narrator like other S. Thompson based films. (Ever check out a film called 'Where the Buffalo Roam' with Bill Murray?) I felt like it didn't need one. Johnny Depp is the public preception of Hunter S. His dialougue played out as if the whole thing was in the point of view of Hunter S's narrative... as opposed to being the acted out versions of actual narrative from the text itself, ala Fear and Loathing.

Some of the bits were even adapted from other works. The characters in the book, for instance, never take morphine and stare at a lobster tank rattling off about the American dream. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon are never mentioned in the book and there are instances where two characters in the book are combined into one (Sanderson is also Yeamon...and while Sanderson is succesful, he's hardly the Mad Men Playboy type we see here...) It's obvious that the film tries to combine all of Hunter S. into one story rather than just the young 1958 version that Hunter S. wrote it as.

The movie takes you on a Hunter S. Thompson ride, not perfectly, but if you want perfect then read the books. This is some actors giving their own personal interpretations of the charcters they play.  The action unfolds under them into a noirish fifties paperback. The girl is sexy as hell, the cars are cool, the dialougue is sharp, the scenery is great, the music is wild....

It felt like the director maybe shot enough film for a twenty hour movie, then chopped out pieces of it at random until it got down to 90 minutes. The whole flow of the movie was disjointed and every scene, after the first ten minutes or so, feels like it comes out of nowhere. As an example, by the end of the movie, Johnny Depp's character is almost obsessed with [spoiler] saving the newspaper (or something)[/spoiler], but we see absolutely nothing of how Depp's character goes from completely apathetic in one scene to stupidly passionate about this in the next. It comes out of nowhere, and seems really forced. I'm only guessing that there is some plausible exposition his character's evolution on a cutting room floor somewhere.

While I'm sure the original material is an highly entertaining collection of anecdotes, it simply doesn't add up to a film (or at least not this one).

Thompson in this long overdue adaptation of The Rum Diary, which while it retains the spirit of Thompson's source material, it also sadly feels somewhat watered down.  Depp plays Paul Kemp, a hard-living New York journalist that winds up in San Juan.  As he gets a feel for the local colour (and booze), Kemp comes across the shady mogul Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) and instantly falls for his stunning fiance (Amber Heard) in the process.  Kemp's journey takes him through the good and bad of the locale and its denizens, although by the time the credits roll, you'll be left feeling a little empty inside.  The spirit of Thompson is definitely felt throughout the proceedings, but for some reason sadly it just doesn't feel one hundred percent right.  Still though, Depp is wonderful, and the rest of the cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins, Michael Rispoli, and Giovanni Ribisi in a scene-stealing role, are great.  All in all, The Rum Diary is hit and miss, and while it probably may never become the cult classic that Terry Gilliam's take on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas did, it's still worth your time regardless.",1330128000,,1190,4.83743842364532

Movie seemed disjointed as it jumped about between people and places. Sketchy as if scripted by committee. Many potentially interesting stories such as the role of tourism and sugar plantations on the lives of the indigenous needed more depth.
The back story of how the book was written; the attempt to movie it; and Thompson's life itself are more interesting than what was selected for the movie. Thompson's life would have been a more interesting movie.

Positives:
Depp showed us his character in being committed, loyal and honest in following through and finishing Thompson's work.
It took about 20 to 30 minutes to sort the movie out and at that point one can just let the scenes jump about without worrying about ""what am I missing here?"" Perhaps mirroring Thompson's life.
Great location, sets, costuming and props authenticity. They actually filmed in some of the original locations. Kudos for that.
Great acting by all. Depp displayed his usual mannerisms but they seemed as if they would fit Thompson's character.
Great dialogue selection showcasing Thompson's thinking, two examples: ""Human beings are the only creatures on Earth that claim a God. And the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one. Does the world belong to no one but you."" and ""This is America. Do you think some plumber from Normal, Illinois saves up for 25 years to come here on a cruise ship to read about bad times in the sugar plantation?

4952873,3,B0064OUGK0,"Based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson of the same name which focuses upon a wandering writer wanna be who takes a job for a rag of a newspaper in Puerto Rico during the 1960s. While there are some notable and interesting themes in this tale about getting too old to do your art and lust coming out after you're drunk beyond belief the flow of this tale was incredibly slow. Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Eckhart star. This is probably best suited for people who enjoyed the novel or who were looking for a tale about writers or who want a high brow picture. Note that HST was known for maniacal characters and in his spare time liked to take all types of drugs. He also hated Nixon with a passion and is credited with Gonzo journalism. It is definitely an homage to the author who died in 2005.

4952877,5,B0064OUGK0,"The ""Rum Diary"" takes us to 1960 Puerto Rico, as we fly in - to the tune of ""Volare"" - aboard a small engine plane with Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp).  He's the ""fresh meat"" for the local paper, a journalist and self-proclaimed ""failed author"", although throughout this film you will find him quite dedicated to his post in his own laughably risible style.

The first day of his new job, he is still quite fueled from the previous rum-soaked night and the editor-in-chief Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) is already questioning his morals and his capability to do the work. Of course, we are seeing Johnny Depp portray an interesting character that is intoxicated the major part of this movie and I felt is hilarious while dishing it out.

Kemp is introduced to Rob Sala (Michael Rispoli), the 'staff recorder', and later to Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), the 'religious correspondent'.  These job titles are certainly a laugh in themselves as they are not even close to what these guys are up to - if they even know themselves. They go in and out of the paper's office, argue constantly with Lotterman and go out in whatever misguided direction that they came in from. Keep an eye on Ribisi's character, Moberg, as I think he steals the show in several places. Kemp was brought into this sinking ship of a paper to appease the locals and try to keep it afloat. This is a kind of slack-off position for Kemp to have to handle, one he does genuinely with an 80 to 151 proof gusto.

The 'problem' arises when Kemp and his buddies begin to care about the paper and sympathize with the people of San Juan, then start to believe in their rights as readers of it.  Aaron Eckhart hands in a great portrayal of the arrogant cad and filthy rich entrepreneur, ""Sanderson"". Amber Heard is ""Chenault"", his beguiling girlfriend and also Kemp's object of desire.

Depp's mannerisms, facial expressions, and sarcastic humor are all spot-on. I definitely can see why he was personally behind the project.  One does not have to be a Hunter S. Thompson fan to enjoy this movie whatsoever.  It is not like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" as it may appear to be compared to. Same author - Different situation (semi-autobiographical account) although one hallucinogenic type scene does take place. Moberg floats in and out of the head-state he is in to end up really enjoying Kemp, and gains a respect for him also.  Eventually, these three are sharing an apartment for a while.  Their delusive conversations are priceless. Directed by Bruce Robinson who adapts from his own screenplay, we have a plot which I enjoyed very much by just taking it for what it is; a Johnny Depp comedy/drama.  The characters in this film turn in much regional color and flavor while Kemp's two cohorts (Sala and Moberg) add shot after shot of liquor-fueled comedy.  Some of the situations that these three get into are over-the-top and make you think, Is this really based on a true story? - Yep.",1329523200,9,2941,4.698443579766537

4952882,2,B0064OUGK0,I think the book must be way better. I have not read the novel but it seems one of those many cases when the movie based on a novel does not live up to expectations.

4952883,4,B0064OUGK0,"I did not see the film in the theatre, so this is my impression from viewing it for the first time.  This is clearly a very difficult book to make into a film.  Since the conflict and dialogue is mostly internal, the visual interpretation comes off as somewhat superfluous.  I was, however, amazed that so many of the scenes were exactly as I had envisioned them from the book.  Wonderful!

But the big themes don't really come through.  I don't think the story works properly at all without showing Kemp being slowly, and unwittingly, sucked into the culture of rum consumption, tying together newcomers and natives alike.  While this culture is a socially accepted norm, the differing motivations of the participants becomes unsettlingly apparent.  It's also important to show him coming to appreciate the natural, historical, and cultural beauty that he discovers in Puerto Rico.  Without it, you can't appreciate his revulsion towards the opportunists whose sole interest is to profit from the raping and plundering of paradise.  The whole story becomes rather pointless without these foundations.

The characters are cast and played to perfection, with the somewhat surprising exception of Johnny Depp's portrayal of Paul Kemp, who seems far too detached.  Without the internal narration that is the hallmark of Hunter S. Thompson, he just falls flat.  If you know the book, I think you'd enjoy the movie.  If you only see the move however, you might be left feeling empty.",1329436800,,1478,5.053719008264463

4952885,4,B0064OUGK0,"To appreciate the quality of this rambling little film that is actually based on an episode in the life of Hunter S. Thompson the following biographical information is helpful: `Hunter Stockton Thompson (1937 - 2005) was an American journalist and author who wrote The Rum Diary (published in1998), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971), Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 (1973), The Curse of Lono (1983), and Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1966). He is credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of reporting where reporters involve themselves in the action to such a degree that they become central figures of their stories. He is known also for his lifelong use of alcohol, LSD, mescaline, and cocaine (among other substances); his love of firearms; his inveterate hatred of Richard Nixon; and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism. In 1960 Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine El Sportivo, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rico English-language daily The San Juan Star, but its managing editor, future novelist William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends and after the demise of El Sportivo, Thompson worked as a stringer for the New York Herald Tribune and a few stateside papers on Caribbean issues with Kennedy working as his editor. While suffering a bout of health problems, he committed suicide in 2005 at the age of 67.'

In the film version of Thompson's autobiographical book, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) is a freelance journalist who finds himself at a critical turning point in his life while writing for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean under toupeed editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). He is accompanied by the staff photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli), the drunken staff writer Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi) in his discovery of the many wonders of Puerto Rico, not the least of which is a group of entrepreneurs lead by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) - who happens to be living with the stunning Chenault (Amber Heard) who Paul is attracted to - and a series of disreputable business men bent on `touristifyng' a neighboring island.  Paul is a drunk and finds innumerable distractions and challenges as he tries to worm his way through the playing field of lost souls.

The story is Hunter S. Thompson all the way and Bruce Robinson has adapted Thompson's book in much the same way the novelist communicates: Robinson also directs. Depp, as usual, manages to make the strange lead character not only interesting but also ingratiating.  The supporting cast is solid. The film gets off track many times, but as pure entertainment it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours watching Depp create another memorable character based on life!

4952886,4,B0064OUGK0,"First let me say, even if I wasn't a Depp fan I would say this movie is at least watchable, but probably not going to be your favorite. Like many other reviewers mentioned this movie is nothing like Fear and Loathing. Which for me is much better. It has always been one of my least favorites and is one of the few Depp movies I do not own. I will also agree that this movie does seem too long for what it is. There are definitely some parts that drag on. Sometimes I wonder if it's just because we've come to expect movies to be full action all the time or if it really does just drag on. Some of the older movies that were classics seem to drag on to me, so who really knows.

I will say that felt that Depp's performance was stellar in this movie, as are with all his movies. So, if you like his stuff you will probably like this movie. I'm not really a fan of Amber Heard but I thought her performance was good as well. To me if it wasn't for her and Paul Kemp's (Depp) relationship in the movie it would have been a complete bore. The guy Kemp rooms with also has some pretty good scenes with him that give the movie some humor.

Truthfully, I felt as if Moberg's character just brought the movie down. Some of the lines his character says was offensive and honestly pathetic. I understand he was suppose to be a drunk wild man and he was just portraying that. I still just found myself really disliking the character. I've even seen Giovanni Ribisi in other movies and thought he was great, but I just didn't like Moberg. I would even go as far to say that if his character had been left out of the movie I would probably have rated this movie five stars.",1329264000,,1660,4.1521739130434785

4952889,3,B0064OUGK0,"In 2011, 13 years after first portraying a Hunter S. Thompson doppelganger in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Johnny Depp took on two roles that referenced the controversial writer: one by way of an animated chameleon that took its cues from Fear and Loathing's Raoul Duke, and the other by way of an adaptation of Thompson's semi-autobiographical debut novel, The Rum Diary. While the former was considered a success, the latter, unfortunately, split critics in much the same way that Fear and Loathing did. The Rum Diary follows journalist Paul Kemp as he travels to Puerto Rico to write for a local paper. While there, Paul is tasked with writing a favorable story about an American entrepreneur intent on exploiting the island for commercial gain, and Paul must contemplate the murky moral nature of the piece. I felt that Depp was as committed to the role as ever, and that the film was colorful and amiable enough, but I was also a bit put off by the rambling source material, which made for an unfocused narrative. Fans of both Thompson and Depp may enjoy the flick, but there are no guarantees here.",1329177600,16,1107,4.740932642487047
4952890,3,B0064OUGK0,"The Rum Diary is based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson, written in the early `60s but not published until 1998. Similarly, this adaptation began shooting in March of 2009 and was not released until October of 2011. After a 19-year-absence, Bruce Robinson returns to the director's chair and, considering his own problems with alcohol and his landmark film Withnail & I covering similar territory, he was an appropriate choice to direct. Johnny Depp plays the lead role and produces. His love for Thompson is well-documented. He, of course, played Raoul Duke in the adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and was close friends with Thompson. Depp had been trying to get this made for years and it was made with Thompson's blessing, although it did not enter principal photography until four years after his death.

This adaptation has divided audiences. I have not read the novel, but many have said it's unfaithful and leaves out some of the best parts of the book. I can't speak for this personally, but I can't say I'm surprised. Even with no frame of reference, something seems to be missing here. It seems strange that Depp would fight so hard to get this novel adapted for the screen only to throw out the best bits of the novel, but truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. It's well-known that Thompson wrote the novel after moving to Puerto Rico and unsuccessfully applying for a job as a journalist at The San Juan Star. The movie seems to imagine what would have occurred had Thompson secured the gig.

Opening in San Juan in 1960, Paul Kemp (Depp), a failed novelist and heavy drinker from New York, awakens from a night fraught with drinking. Putting on a straw hat and sunglasses, he goes to his job interview at The San Juan Star. The editor, E.J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) hires Kemp only because he foresees the newspaper going under.

Settling in, Kemp befriends Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli), the staff photographer and vicariously befriends Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), a reporter who has retreated so far into the mind of an addict he doesn't seem to be able to consciously realize that he's been fired. While Kemp and Sala get into a series of misadventures around Puerto Rico, Kemp is talked up by Hal Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a shady property developer who wants to manipulate Kemp's journalistic skill to his financial benefit. Sanderson's fiance Chenault (Amber Heard) may just seal the deal for Kemp.

Anyone expecting Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is going to be disappointed. The essence of Raoul Duke is apparent in Depp's portrayal of Paul Kemp, but the film and the character are wildly different both tonally and aesthetically. What ultimately brings the film down is that it's a lot of rambling with no sense of direction. The locale is beautiful (the film was actually shot in Puerto Rico), Ms. Heard is exquisitely beautiful, and the actors are fun to watch, but the story isn't compelling enough to be an engaging film. Perhaps the novel was, but Bruce Robinson apparently took too many creative liberties with the story.

With that said, The Rum Diary is a different beast from the average mainstream film. I doubt it would have seen a wide release without Depp's involvement. There's a darkness, a cynicism; a sort of dour pacing that not's often seen in mainstream film. This may be the Hollywood streamlined version of the book, but its European flavor is quite different from the average Hollywood-fare. The way the relationship between Depp and Heard pans out is pretty depressing by Hollywood standards. The film even ends on a sad note, until a title card glosses over everything.

It's clear from his performance that Depp was passionate about this project, even if that passion was ego-driven. Watching him play the more subdued Paul Kemp is just as droll as watching him play Raoul Duke. It's nice to see such a marvelous talent return to some form of reality. It's been a long time since Depp has played a typical human being. His chemistry with Rispoli is nice, comparable to the chemistry he shared with Del Toro in Fear and Loathing. The two share many scenes together and get some poignancy and humor out of those scenes. Ribisi fits nicely into Thompson's world; hilariously over-the-top, but fascinating to watch.

The Rum Diary is interesting and quirky, but ultimately a bit of a failure. Considering the talent involved it should have been so much better. It fails to engage its audience and doesn't develop enough story or character, despite a two-hour running time. If nothing else, The Rum Diary has inspired me to read the book just so I can see what a missed opportunity this was.

4952896,2,B0064OUGK0,"A reporter, ideally, is supposed to seek out and expose the truth. If you can't find the truth or your superiors don't it want it published, make it up. At least that's the preferred method undertaken at The San Juan Star in this bizarre comedy based on the novel of same name.

  Paul Kemp (played in typically off-the-wall fashion by Johnny Depp) is a novelist whose greatest work of fiction was the resume which got him a job at the Puerto Rico periodical. Determined to show the real living conditions outside the beach houses and five-star resorts, Kemp (Depp) experiences and recounts tales of dive bars, cock fights, and poverty among the local population. It becomes clear to him that his employers were looking for something they can print in a brochure, as opposed to the facts. While trying to satisfy his employers, Kemp encounters a local businessman by the name of Sanderson (played by Aaron Eckhart) after a chance encounter with his much younger fiance Chenault (played by Amber Heard). Sanderson has a proposition for Kemp and Chenault proves herself to be intriguing, unsatisfied, and just out of Kemp's reach.

  While the accent's gone and the surroundings are meant to be gritty rather than supernatural, Paul Kemp is played here as though he's Jack Sparrow in a suit and tie for most of the film. He's perpetually inebriated and skates from one `dangerous' situation to the next without as much as a scratch. And while the later portions of the film seem to build toward some dramatic confrontation, what Kemp and the viewers are left with is disappointment.",1327017600,6,1580,4.855018587360595

8492755,4,B0064OUGK0,"Not the best Johnny Depp film I've ever seen, but as a struggling writer myself I couldn't help but enjoy it. It definitely has it's moments, and I welcome it as part of my DVD library. Bottoms up, boys and girls! Enjoy...",1519689600,,222,4.309523809523809
8492756,5,B0064OUGK0,"Hands down one of the better Depp movies. He acts really well, and the plot keeps your attention. If you like Depp at all, and you enjoy more international-themed movies, you'll like this one. Oh yea, and you will likely want to enjoy drinking too, as it goes quite well with this movie.",1515542400,,287,4.433962264150943
8492757,5,B0064OUGK0,"This is one of those movies that you either seem to love... or hate.

I happen to love it.

There are some wonderful richly-worded quotes in this film, and their attempt at conveying the mid 20th century feel of a transitioning Puerto Rico is a bit shallow, but still better than most I've found.

This one is in my ""classics"" library....but so is ""Escanaba in Da' Moonlight"", so do some ""trailer"" research and form your own opinions.",1514246400,2,434,4.6103896103896105
8492758,5,B0064OUGK0,"This story had a change of events for me. While watching Johnny Depp and awaiting to see his full potential acting skills, a star was already shining in Giovanni Ribisi's performance as Moberg. The comical highlight in the move came when the 3 main characters go to Papa Nebo's, ""The Hermaphroditic Oracle of the Dead,""  to have a protective curse put on El Monstro. Good show, Giovanni......You were Spot On. ""Curse Active.""",1513987200,,425,4.902777777777778
