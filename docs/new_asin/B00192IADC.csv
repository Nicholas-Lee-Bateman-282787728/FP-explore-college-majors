8271615,4,B00192IADC,"I ordered this video in order to teach a variation to my dance students--""I Will Worship Christ,"" performed by Ms. James herself.  I had learned the variation at the Ballet Magnificat! Summer intensive as a student myself, many years ago, and i was so happy to be able to pass it on to my own students.  The video was very grainy and the quality was not good at all, but it could very well be due to the pitiful old TV we have at the dance studio, rather than a problem with the VHS tape itself.  Besides, i only wanted to refresh my memory of the choreography, so i didn't need a crystal-clear image.  I also used this video for a dance history/appreciation assignment.  I sent the video home with a student, who studied it, researched it, and wrote an essay.  It is great to have such a ""safe"" work of dance for students.  Some of the more famous ballets (like Scheherazade, for example), are beautiful and timeless, but the costumes, movements, and subject matter are a little to risque--especially in the deeply conservative deep South, where i live.  This is one of my favorite Ballet Magnificat! works, and i'm really glad to have it in my library, even if it's in VHS format.",1301788800,,1182,4.490654205607477
