461417,1,6302428637,"I was very disappointed with this film.  This movie doesn't deserve any stars.  It is pure fiction.  Neither the man nor the events are accurately portrayed.  If you want the real story, read ""My Life and Work"" by Henry Ford.  Much of what is shown simply isn't true, or in the best case, is terribly skewed and incomplete.  Ford's greatest accomplishments are ignored, while faults he never possessed are manufactured in this film.  Produced by some of Ford's numerous and specious detractors, this film will be offensive to anyone who is familiar with credible historical sources.  Don't waste your money.",1214524800,2,607,5.0
461418,4,6302428637,"I think enemies of Ford had something to do with this film's production.  It casts Henry in a very negative light.  While I've heard so many great things about the man and his machine, this movie manages to leave most of them out of the story.  The 800 page book by Robert Lacey which was the basis appears to have been far more even in its coverage, judging by its reviews.

Did we gain appreciation for the genius of the assembly line process?  No, we observed the painful effects it had on the laborers forced to work harder and faster than they could bear.  Did we get to see Henry's intellectual friendship with Edison, and their little-known attempt to mass produce electric cars?  No.  Did we get to see Henry's all-too-human affair?  And Henry's appalling treatment of Edsel?  And the Nazi connection?  Sure; the unflattering tidbits get special coverage here.

The impression I was left with after many hours of viewing was: why is Ford Motor still alive today?  After seeing the miserable family affairs of Ford crumble, the succession plan ruined, the union/mafia violence, and the vindictive senator's quest for revenge against Ford... I wonder how the company managed to survive and prosper.  Clearly, one must turn to the book for an unbiased explanation.  Still, it was an entertaining movie.",1182816000,7,1307,4.850678733031674

461455,5,6302428637,"I saw this film when it premiered in syndication nearly 30 years ago. I hadn't thought of it in years when I picked up an immaculate copy of the Robert Lacy best seller on which this was based. I was surprised and delighted to find out it was available on a very reasonably priced DVD, which I finished watching tonight. This is one great mini-series. The kind they just don't make any more. The attention to period detail and the lavishness of this production are first rate. Cliff Robertson is amazing as Henry Ford and Hope Lange hits just the right note of quiet dignity as Clara Ford. The other actors and characters are fleshed out by a first-rate supporting cast. If you think this is going to be a dull semi-documentary about the Ford Motor Company, you are in for a surprise, for the screenplay is rich in incident, mostly true, and yes probably a bit embellished. But the complexities of the man known as the man who put America on wheels are represented here, warts and all. This film was engrossing for me to watch today as it was back in 1987. I highly, highly recommend it.",1459900800,6,1087,4.467336683417085

The film begins with the disappearance of Henry Ford in 1927 Dearborn. There was a trial at that time. [Fords laying in bed recalls scenes from Citizen Kane.] This delicately touches on Fords obsession with those of a certain religion. Next we see a young and healthy Ford working on a model gasoline engine at home. There was a need for a motorized vehicle that was more fuel-efficient than a horse. [The bicycle craze of the 1880s gave people more freedom to travel,] Detroit was close to manufacturing, they were not wed to old technology (bicycles or trains). Another scene shows Fords interest in strange philosophies like reincarnation. A win at a race showed Ford built a better product. The investors in the company ended Fords dream and taught him the need for independence from capitalists. This concentration on Fords business troubles shows his career had its ups and downs. Ford bought a majority of the shares so he is free to build cars for everybody. This helped to end the isolation of rural life.

The Ford Model T had the record for the greatest production of an automobile until the VW Beetle bypassed it. Fords sales kept climbing, he learned how to produce more with the constraints of limited manpower. The solution was a fine division of labor on the assembly line. [But no worker knew the whole car and had less pride in workmanship. Humans and machines have their limits. Ford doubled mens wages and cut their hours; this boosted production. Ford was against war, it only benefitted Wall Street and the bankers. [But a countrys rulers are not just the bankers,] Fords destruction of Edsels surprise car shows some mental problem (just hardening of the arteries?). Ford cant accept the reality of the new surpassing the old. Does Fords relationship with a young woman provide another parallel to Citizen Kane?

Fords River Rouge complex will be the biggest in the country - over three square miles. Ford will not be dependent on any outside suppliers. [This means building over-capacity when production slows.] Ford arranges a marriage for his cast-off mistress, like some European nobleman. [Power corrupts yet again.] Ford cut dividends for new development and to force out minority share owners (the Dodge brothers). There is a conflict between Henry and Edsel over the declining sales of the Model T. Henrys grasp of reality is slipping. The Model A arrives, and so does the Great Depression. Their police and firemen try to stop the unemployed from protesting. Fords gangsters shoot down striking workers. The Wagner Act recognized the right of workers to organize a union.

The war meant changes. Edsel is involved with the change-over for defense work (trucks, tanks, airplanes). Henry is growing senile, but is still powerful and irrational. [This is Exhibit A for mandatory retirement.] Edsel died from stomach cancer (decades of stress?). Years later Henry II returned from the Navy to take control as President of Ford. [Decades later Henry II would have problems at the end of his reign.] Films are the condensed version of the book they are taken from. Henry Ford certainly had a very interesting life, going from mechanic to one of the richest men in America. This film ignores the important fight over the Selden patents which tried to restrict production without tributes to paper copyrights. It does not mention much about Fords association with Edison and Firestone, both self-made men.",1387324800,,3460,4.970639032815199
