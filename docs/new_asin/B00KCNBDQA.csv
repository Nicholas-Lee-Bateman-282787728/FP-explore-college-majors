8657638,3,B00KCNBDQA,"Great documentary with alot of guest speakers like Sara (Boris) Karloff and Bela Lugosi Jr.

The film clips and trailers for movies talked about are preserved very well and set up the enjoyment to be seen.

Showcasing BORIS KARLOFF and BELA LUGOSI and nice little tributes to Lon Chaney,Jr and Peter Lorre.

This really covers from the beginning of films to 30s,40s and ends with ABBOT & COSTELLO monster film series in the 1950s.

The information on Carl Laemmle creating UNIVERSAL STUDIOS , Was fascinating the guy loved Movie Monsters !",1417910400,3,539,4.8901098901098905

8657640,4,B00KCNBDQA,"Part1 of ""Monster Madness: Golden Age of Horror"" is an ambitious 90-minute ride with Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney, and ""Frankenstein"".Seasoned monster-movie fans won't find too much that's new here, but extended clips and comments on ""Bride of Frankenstein"" ain't too bad. And you get Mank. Gregory Mank. Gregory W. Mank wrote his first book about twenty years ago. An Amazon reviewer said it stunk. It did. But Mank came back, becoming one of the best horror-film historians with articles in Filmfax, commentaries on classic horror DVD,s, and a series of books worth reading(I just ordered Mank's new book). In ""Monster Madness"", Mank reviews the 1934 ""Black Cat"" classic, as Boris and Bela face-off in crisp-clear movie clips from the film. Mank tackles the daring perversity Edgar Ulmer unveiled. Except for Gary J. Svehla(""Midnight Marquee""), the other commentaries are mostly from B-movie book authors without the credentials to really have much to say. Extended recordings from monster-movie conventions seem to only cheapen the effect. The real star of ""Monster Madness"" is the rich cache of film clips, including rare scenes from ""The Bells(1926)"","" Just Imagine(1930)"", and a very rare trailer from ""Mad Love(1935)"" with star Peter Lorre. And you got Mank.....",1409184000,6,1264,5.325
8657641,3,B00KCNBDQA,"I had high hopes for Monster Madness: The Golden Age Of The Horror Film. I saw the cover art of the DVD on Amazon.com and bought it on the image alone. I love documentaries on older horror movies and have many many of them on VHS tape. Monster Madness is on DVD+R disc format which I normally will not buy because some DVD+R discs will not play on my DVD player. The fact that Monster Madness is on DVD+R was not stated on Amazon.com which I think is wrong. So be aware of this before you buy this DVD. I have a large screen TV and many of the images of movies being reviewed on this DVD are in terrible shape. A good example is the movie Dracula from Universal Studios which looks like it was recorded at SLP VHS speed. The stagecoach scene from this movie is absolutely horrible - dark blotches moving around the screen everywhere. I have this same movie on regular DVD in perfect shape, so I don't understand why a company would put out a DVD with movies images in such sad shape. Many scenes from other movies are in the same terrible shape. The sound isn't much better. I was constantly turning the volume up to hear what was being said in some of the movies being reviewed and turning it down at other times. Volume leveling was not used on this DVD I guess. I think the company who put out this DVD spent more money on the DVD cover art then the product itself. If you want to buy this DVD, try to buy it at a lower used price because it is not worth 16.98. If I were to put a price on this DVD as to what it is worth, it would be about 5.00 dollars at most. Something that I would buy at Walmart in the 5.00 dollar bin. Still, it's not a total loss. I did see several movies that I had completely forgotten about and now will most likely try to buy on DVD and add to my collection. I give this DVD 4 stars for the variety of older horror movies being reviewed and 2 stars for picture quality & sound - for a grand total of 3 stars.",1408233600,11,1939,4.065274151436031
8657642,3,B00KCNBDQA,"As a lifelong monster movie fan, and one who especially enjoys the early days of the art form, I was initially very excited about this release.  A feature-length documentary about the classic films from the 1920's, 30's and 40's seemed to be right up my alley, although I did find myself wondering about this company (Filmlandia) about which I'd never heard.  But the back cover boasted that the program won a 2012 ""Rondo"" award (again, not ringing any bells), so I hoped for the best.

And truthfully, ""Monster Madness"" isn't a bad documentary, especially for newcomers just learning about the genre's roots.  But for those of us steeped in horror filmmaking lore, there really isn't much new information.  Any self-respecting monster fan already has the excellent series of Universal DVD's or Blu-rays, on which one can enjoy several well-made documentaries on the individual films, or the Universal monster series as a whole.  Monster Madness rightfully does spend a large amount of time on the studio, although it does acknowledge the contributions of MGM and Paramount, among others.

The main problem with the film is that the source prints for most of the movies discussed are in terrible shape.  Good DVD copies of the Universal series have been available for many years, yet the clips used here could easily be 25 year old VHS tapes.  It's very distracting, considering the newly-filmed interviews and such are generally of very good quality.

The film also has a sometimes annoying tendency to drift away from its namesake.  Several minutes are devoted to films from other genres in the late 1930's.  I could understand a few lines here and there to put the horror films into the perspectives of their times, but much of it fills like filler.

Apparently the film is part one of a series, but I'm not sure I will want to continue with it.  If you know next to nothing about the classic era of monsters on film, you will learn a bit about it here.  But seasons fright film vets will probably watch this one once and never pick it up again.  Sadly, I think I will be among that group.",1408060800,9,2092,4.753462603878116
