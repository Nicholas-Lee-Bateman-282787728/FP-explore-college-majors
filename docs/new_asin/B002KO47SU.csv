8372136,5,B002KO47SU,"I love all things JOHN SCHNEIDER. John lends his lyrical voice as a dad with two young children who discover a vehicle/plane from outer space. The cartoon continues from the point of view of the family dog who has many adventures in a land far away. During moments between the action, John sings soft ballads that I have never heard recorded before. The movie ends with the dog wondering if it all had been a dream, but as a surprise, he is given a little puppy by John and family. It turns out to be the same puppy with whom he had loved in his dream. So was it all a dream? It's only 50 minutes, but it's fun to watch with the family, or just to listen to the crooning songs by John Schneider.",1288915200,,695,4.155555555555556
