6590652,5,B00MO21VC8,"Although Johnny Carson gets almost all the attention when it comes to legendary talk show hosts from the
old school days of broadcasting, viewing this amazing three decades spanning set of MERV GRIFFIN SHOW
material - over 40 hours worth - reveals that Merv fronted a daily show just as entertaining and probably even
more varied than The Tonight Show.
This 12 DVD package covers an amazing amount of territory with legends from film, television, stage, sports,
politics, the literary world and pop culture in general.
Overall there is a relaxed vibe thanks to Merv's calm demeanor but he's also a witty, warm and welcome
presence who allows his guests to speak and conduct fun and fascinating conversations. There's a ton of
history to be found and you really get to know these celebrities and other public figures in a way that just
doesn't seem possible in today's soundbite world.
This is a rare event and the vintage footage from 1962-1986 looks fantastic.",1415750400,2,961,4.901840490797546
6590653,5,B00MO21VC8,"What an exciting chance to relive a truly amazing era in entertainment - one that will never be again!  This historic collection carefully curates a vast spectrum of artists, musicians, politicians and news makers - without playing demographic favoritism. The scope of this set is incredible - and offers a window into a time when television was THE medium of the moment - with no challengers in sight.  Even more incredibly, thanks to the beautifully-transferred tape masters - it presents for the first time in many decades a look at the 1960s talk show era on videotape - lending it the modern immediacy that filmed kinescopes always betray.  The packaging and menus are classic and stylish, yet convey a sense of fun and passion for what is being presented.  I spent years worrying about what would happen to these shows if a release was ever attempted - we're all familiar with some of the half-baked releases from this genre -  thankfully, there's nothing half-baked about this set - and I'm truly grateful. Congrats to all involved - you did right by Merv.  He left an amazing legacy... from Warhol to Whitney, it's a gas, gas, gas!",1415577600,2,1139,4.785714285714286
6590654,5,B00MO21VC8,"I'm only up to Disc 5, and I feel as if I've already gotten my money's worth. Yes, it's that entertaining. Truly vintage interviews, and performances. Historical records of this sort don't come around everyday either. MLK, RFK, riveting. I highly recommend this set to anyone that saw these shows the first time around, to anyone simply interested in this classic set.
BTW, you can take any Reelin In The Years title, and be assured of the vaults being opened wide. Enjoy !",1415491200,4,473,4.710843373493976
6590655,5,B00MO21VC8,"I went straight to the episode saluting William Wyler, as I recall enjoying that episode when it originally aired.  What a time capsule it is!  The first thing I noticed was all the smoking, especially by Walter Pidgeon.  You'd never see such graphic enjoyment of tobacco today on television.  It's amazing that he lived as long as he did, as he practically makes love to that cigarette, more so than Bette Davis, who was sitting beside him as if in a race for the smokers' championship.  Everyone's recalling their work from twenty-five to thirty-five years ago and now, here it is forty plus years later!

I can't wait to savor more episodes, one at a time, over the next several months.  This is one of the stellar releases of the year for me, reminiscent of the Cavett Show  sets.  It features several complete episodes (any breakaways for movie clips are eliminated due to rights' issues, of course) and countless additional interview segments as bonus extras.  The quality of the videotape transfers is extraordinary.  It is indeed a time capsule to a bygone era.  A must for fans of mid-twentieth century culture at its zenith!",1415059200,31,1134,4.788659793814433
6590656,5,B00MO21VC8,"MERV is back in a fantastic, all-new DVD set from Reelin' In The Years Productions and MPI Home Video.  ""The Merv Griffin Show"" is a 12 disc set that faithfully represents Merv Griffin's incredible career behind the desk from 1962 to 1986.  There are priceless moments from many masters of comedy (Jack Benny, Henny Youngman, Jerry Lewis, Woody Allen, Lucille Ball, Carl Reiner) along with a bevy of fresh-faced ""newbies"" (a short-haired George Carlin; Richard Pryor; Jerry Seinfeld; Jay Leno, et al.).  Music lovers will be utterly delighted with the diverse selection of artists and genres featured here. (Look for the national debut of a 19 year old kid from New Jersey named Whitney Houston!)  Since their inception in the 1950s, television talk shows have chronicled our perpetually changing times and tastes. The Griffin show epitomized this by blending topical conversation into the daytime variety/talk framework. And so, we are treated to historic interviews with Dr. Martin Luther King, Richard M. Nixon, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, President Gerald Ford, and President Ronald Reagan.  There are bonus features galore.  Among them: Rare episodes from Merv's late-night CBS series (yes, Merv was a rival of Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show"" from 1969 to 1972); a nice chunk from his NBC daytime show, circa 1962 (long thought to be lost); and an amusing snippet from 1986 in which Merv gives ""tips"" to young Jay Leno on how to host a talk show!  The visual quality is stunning throughout, particularly in the early black & white episodes with Arthur Treacher.  The set is accompanied by a 52 page booklet that includes a foreward by Dick Cavett; rare photos (most of which have never been published before); extensive liner notes detailing the history of the program; and an account by the producers explaining how the tapes were located and painstakingly restored. This set will be a welcome addition to the collection any serious student or casual connoisseur of classic television.",1413936000,19,1989,5.117283950617284

6590658,1,B00MO21VC8,"I am shocked to see they haven't included the episode with guest Doris Day. She is the biggest box office legend and has done very few interviews. Highly entertaining show with Doris being very candid and quite comfortable with Merv. Merv was discovered by Doris and her husband playing in a club. They brought him to Hollywood and he did a small part in her 1953 musical BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON. He went on to star with Kathryn Grayson in SO THIS IS LOVE.. After that it was television. I am very dissappointed that this show isn't mentioned in the table of contents>(Actually she has appeared twice on his show.

Orsen was in a great mood and would speak about things n folks that he dared not mention ever before but the night this was taped, he was in a great mood so he told Merv to 'ask away' and its sooo worth it! and the magic trick is amazing also! then you have so many that were just starting out n who today r well known and most r pretty good and deserve their 'fame' i guess. to have a whole show with John Denver singing and chatting and then to hear the one hit Starland Vocal Band perform that 'one hit' was great to see! and these folks on this dvd set actually SING!! not like the lip synch crap of today. i could go on but if you know Merv show you will grab it and i hope they do put out a volume 2 of the shows as i would grab it in a second! great stuff!! n if you look for sales their out there as i bought mine for 48 bucks! great set!!",1420848000,3,1626,3.8136094674556213

6590669,5,B00MO21VC8,"As the author of Mervs first published biography (1976), I was eager to get my hands on the newly released 12-disc set from the MPI Media Group, THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW (1962-1986).  For me, Merv was always the nicest, most entertaining talk show host of his day.  On stage or off, what you saw was the real thing.  Merv Griffin was truly a terrific entertainer and, more importantly, a kind, likable man.

The 12-disc set is a treasure trove; a mixture of complete shows, dating back to the programs beginnings, plus individual segments featuring various notable guests.  As of this writing, Ive only had the opportunity to view the first two discs, but in those, Mervs dialogues delighted me with everybody from Oscar Levant, Tallulah Bankhead, Henny Youngman and Carol Burnett, plus I laughed at George Carlins stand-up routine; enjoyed Lionel Hampton on the vibes and Frankie Laines singing.  One of the most interesting interviews was with  Captain Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the Japanese air attack  on Pearl Harbor.

One thing I like about this set is that the menu allows you to watch an entire show or skip to a particular guest that interests you.

In this set, Merv not only interviews ( and elicits performances) with actors (e.g. John Wayne, Jane Fonda, Orson Welles, Warren Beatty, Ingrid Bergman, Lucille Ball, Laurence Olivier), people from the music world (e.g. Phil Spector, Stevie Wonder,  Carole King, Loretta Lynn),  comedians (e.g. Bill Cosby, Don Rickles, Mel Brooks, Joan Rivers, Steve Martin),  artists and writers (e.g. Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali, Ray Bradbury, James Michener, Norman Rockwell), but also historical figures like presidents Reagan, Nixon and Ford, Martin Luther King, Robert F. Kennedy and Rosa Parks.

Indeed, this fantastic set is an entertaining and informative historical record, filled with precious moments in time with some of the worlds most renowned individuals.

6590670,5,B00MO21VC8,"I got this boxed set as a gift and I was totally blown away.  Being of the age and having grown up in LA, I was lucky to attend Merv's show several times.  This was a trip down memory lane as well as amazing documentation of our American culture during an almost quarter of a century.  So glad these won't be lost to history.  Thanks Reelin In The Years!",1418860800,4,354,4.086956521739131
6590671,5,B00MO21VC8,"I am the author of THE MOOSE THAT ROARED and a long-time TV-radio historian and collector. I can say without qualification that this is the finest vintage TV release I've bought, and I've collected many over the years. Not only is the quality and restoration work the best I've seen, but the selection is intelligent and historically vital, if you consider rare appearances of such luminaries as Dr. Martin Luther King (just  months before his assassination) and comic/activist Dick Gregory to be important social documents. Their loquaciousness and calmness of reasoning makes modern day sound bite discourse seem often shallow and, yes, dumbed down in comparison.  This time capsule set of DVDs is lovingly crafted and certainly will be the catalyst to a major re-evaluation of the lesser lauded talk shows and their place in TV history: Merv (and Mike Douglas too) have always been relegated as less important than the late night and less serious shows like Carson.  The individual episodes, with mostly very generous chunks of shows, also put paid to any smug feeling that we are far more sophisticated than back in the 1960s...watch these early shows and pine for a time when opinions could be debated without the ugly stridency of today's mind-numbing quick attention span blather. This was a world before the often-vacuous modern celebrity cult phenomenon when people took time, and our intelligence wasn't insulted.  Along with serious interviews there are many excellent examples of fine entertainers and comics too. Enjoyment factor is very high in this set and I am very happy to give it my highest recommendation.  Please spread the word to show biz buffs, TV collectors and historical junkies...the more folk who purchase this set, the better chance of more volumes to come.  A magnificent DVD release!",1417564800,3,1815,5.114864864864865

I recall seeing this episode and taking an audio recording of the show, which I still have. He sang 3 numbers (Seven Days Of Love, River St Marie & Your Cheatin' Heart) only 2 are featured on this disc (River St Marie is missing).
Just wondered if any other reviewer has found same problem on other shows",1417478400,5,520,4.416666666666667

Print quality is amazing, liner notes are incredible, and the selection of shows is great.  The one episode from 1973 with Jack Benny as the sole guest was very interesting.  Benny, 79 at the time, (he passed in December 1974) was still sharp and at the top of his game.  Merv's ability to interview him and bring out details of Benny's film career was great.  Another episode featuring the lovely and talented Tallulah Bankhead (and Arthur Treacher as Merv's sidekick) is priceless.  MPI is to be applauded for this fun release...I hope there will be more!!",1417219200,4,665,4.632478632478633

6590677,5,B00MO21VC8,"For anyone who wants to see the golden age of talk shows, this set is for you. Back to the days when guests were given a chance to have a conversation with the host and not just have their 6 minutes of being a foil for the host's jokes. And the guests stayed to join the conversation, and were not whisked off stage once they'd promoted their latest film/book/appearance.

Reelin' In The Years has combed the exisiting Merv Griffin Show archive to produce a stellar look at not only show business personalities, but newsmakers as well. Spanning Merv's early New York years with Westinghouse thru his final signoff in 1986, this 12-disc set provides a wonderful history lesson. There is also plenty of bonus material to round out the set.

Technical quality is excellent. Reelin' In the Years has remastered all of the footage to provide the best quality possible from the existing elements, and has ensured that the discs have been properly encoded to retain the live tape look of the originals. Hats off to RIY for making some of this treasure trove available to the public in such pristine condition.

 Hopefully, we can look forward to additional releases in the future.",1416009600,5,1173,4.763546798029557
6590678,5,B00MO21VC8,"By Steve Crum

""The Merv Griffin Show,"" 1962-86 DVD boxed set is arguably the most entertaining and eclectic show business celebration ever produced. The multiple Emmy Award winning talk show, which was more aptly a variety show, is represented via 12 DVDs aka 42 hours (!) of dynamite guests, all introduced and interviewed by Merv Griffin.

This is not to say all was song, dance, and comedy in the ""Griffin Show"" world. Like Jack Paar before him, Mervs guest list often included extended and incisive conversations with the likes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, then former Vice President Richard Nixon, authors Alex Haley and Gore Vidal, and drug culture guru Dr. Timothy Leary. They are all part of this terrifically fun and fascinating DVD set which also serves as a social document of the mid to late 20th Century.

Two years in the making, this massive broadcasting gem is a collaborative effort between Reelin in the Years Productions and The Griffin Group. During that time, outside sources were necessarily tapped since a majority of the 4,500-plus episodes were missing due to original video masters being erased, a common practice to save money decades back.

As described in the sets informative 52-page booklet, many of the Griffin shows included were found in private collections, including one gem from Mervs own video stash. That particular program, helmed by Isaac Hayes, is an hour long, star packed musical salute to vintage Stax recording artists.

The Nixon library supplied two segments withno surpriseRichard Nixon. Thanks to CBS Television, DVD producers were able able to include segments featuring Dennis Hopper and Willie Mays (who bats baseballs into the audience). At searchs end, nearly 1,800 of the 4,500 shows were found and, when necessary, restored to pristine condition. The early black and white shows through the later color programs are in superb audio and video shape.

Show business fans like yours truly will geek out on this massive overdose of movie, TV, music, books, sports, and political luminaries. Griffin seems to have had every conceivable name on his show at one time or another, and often in some of the oddest celebrity combinations imaginable. Take King of the One-Liners Henny Youngman, please. Henny shares Mervs Nov. 11, 1965 dais with Frankie Laine, Minnie Pearl, George Carlin, and Col. John Glenn. Laine sings two songs, Pearl sings one, and Carlin does a standup. Oh yes, and Youngman does a standup. And Glenn does a sit-down interview.

Incidentally, the shows vary in length from under an hour to 80 minutes, with commercials omitted. Mervs shows over the years were from 60-90 minutes. Locales also vary, from Hollywood to New York to Las Vegas. Shorter celebrity spots are also added, usually in the Extras portion of each disc.

Merv incorporated filmed segments into many of his shows, including a must-see 1970 hour with John Wayne at his ranch. Within that segment an earlier Wayne interview in Mexico is also shown. Both Wayne and Griffin had been hitting the tequila, so their repartee is a bit under the influence. Classic.

From a young Stevie Wonder singing and playing the harmonica to Jayne Mansfield accompanied by her three children (including a toddler named Mariska Hargitay) and their dogs, eye candy and name dropping abound. I am still both pleased and disturbed about seeing the 1985 show featuring Orson Welles. For the first time publicly, Welles talked about his marriage to Rita Hayworth and films, including Citizen Kane. Hours after the taping, Welles died at his home.

I feel like splashing the pluses of this boxed set like a Golden Age of Hollywood publicist: SEE Miss Lillian Carter dance with Andy Williams after he sings Moon RiverBette Davis and Olivia de Havilland in a salute to William Wylerthe cast of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan""the cast of ""The Golden Girls""the cast of ""Rocky III""Whitney Houston's debut...Jerry Lewis doing extreme spit takes with Merv and Richard PryorBurt Ward and Adam West of ""Batman""Lucille Ball and FamilyDanny Kaye literally taking over Mervs showand Moms Mabley, The Muppets, Mel Brooks, Steve Martin, and onward.

Equally fascinating is Merv Griffin himself, a talented, educated, humorous, and extremely good host and interviewer. He leans into his guests comments, and listens. It is also obvious he did his homework in preparation. Thanks to Merv, venerable Hollywood movie actor Arthur Treacher enjoyed a happy, late career as Mervs sidekick and announcer. Treacher is featured on the early shows from NYC, but declined to move when the show relocated to the West Coast in 1970.

The accompanying booklet includes an impressively detailed, lengthy overview of the Griffin show by Steve Randisi and an introduction by Dick Cavett, who is also featured on a couple of the shows.

The Welles and John Wayne pieces alone are worth the admission price.",1415923200,14,4901,5.080845771144278
6590679,5,B00MO21VC8,"Here's the dear boy himself...Meeeeervyn! So said the late, great Arthur Treacher from 1965 to 1969 on Group W's The Merv Griffin Show taped at the Little Theatre in Times Sqaure. This DVD collection is such a wonderful treat to watch. Merv was always one of my favorite talk show hosts. He had a calm, friendly demeanor and contrary to what some have said about his interviewing style he was quite good at it. Merv was a real professional interviewer keeping things light when a comedian appeared on his show or keeping things more serious, probing gently, when the guest was of a serious nature. Anyway, this DVD set is a blessing. I liked all the incarnations of the Merv show from 1962 to 1986 and much of it is represented in this collection.
