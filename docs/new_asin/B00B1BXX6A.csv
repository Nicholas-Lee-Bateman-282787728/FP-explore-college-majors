8560573,4,B00B1BXX6A,"For a very long time, one's only chance of seeing celebrated experimental film-maker James Benning's work was in a rare film festival or museum.  But now there have been a series of 5 of these 2 disc sets released on ""Edition Filmmuseum"".  You can order them directly from their website, if you can't find them at a reasonable price elsewhere.

As for these three films, my thoughts from my film journal...

El Valley Centro (2000) --Part of Bennings California Trilogy,  this is among the two or three of his films I've enjoyed most of the 11 I've seen to date.  Benning examines Californias Central Valley in a series of long, static and mostly beautifully composed images, often using a symmetrical frame that echoes the way people have shaped the land.  He brings out the oddness of the area Ive always felt  theres barely an inch of the area that hasn't been re-shaped by man, and yet it is largely devoid of people, being mostly vast agricultural tracts.  Theres a clear, ominous note of how man is destroying the environment around him, whether in the crop duster flying straight at the camera, or the local fisherman, whose line goes into filthy looking water passing through a concrete channel.  For an hour and a half film composed of nothing but long, silent images, I was shocked at how quickly the time passed, and how, by the end, I felt I had experienced something emotional as well as intellectual.

Los (2001) -In the 2nd part of his California Trilogy Benning once again employs the exact same format as his earlier El Valley Centro; 35 two and a half minute long static shots, often symmetrically framed. But this time they give a portrait of the Los Angeles region instead of the Central Valley.  While there are some very strong images here, and some interesting juxtapositions (desert to skyscrapers, etc.) reminding one just how oddly topically diverse and physically huge Los Angeles is, it lacked the feel of a unifying theme that made El Valley Centro so engaging.  Also, while some images are truly striking, others felt less so, whereas in the earlier film, almost every image had a resonance for me.  Still, Benning is amazing in his ability to make this kind of highly regimented and experimental work feel alive and far from a chore to sit through.

Sogobi (2002) -- The last part of Bennings California Trilogy.  It follows the exact same template; static camera, 35 shots, each 2.5 minutes long.  But where El Valley Centro concentrated on the man-remade agricultural areas of mid-California, and Los on Los Angeles and its environs, Sogobi covers those areas of California that are still wild for the moment.  The first half hour or so show no sign of human involvement.  For the first time in the trilogy we see streams made by nature, not by man.  And the first human appearance is relatively begin  a helicopter scooping water from a fresh pristine stream to fight a forest fire.  Man actually working with nature.  But gradually, as the film goes along, we see more and more disturbing images of mans inroads into these more beautiful, isolated places; a convoy of military trucks barreling through a dirt road in the desert, a hug pile of felled trees at a lumber facility.  Its clear that even these beautiful spots may not stay untouched for long.  This is probably the least engaging of the trilogy, in that the beauty shots, while wonderful, are more familiar, and the issue of man invading the wilderness has been seen in numerous other films, whereas the first two films focused on the more complex interplay left after man has already tamed the wild.  Still pretty interesting for a film that is nothing but series of still images, but less thought-provoking than its predecessors.",1398211200,2,3727,4.793427230046948
