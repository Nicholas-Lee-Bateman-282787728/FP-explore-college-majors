7875396,5,6304672985,"This is one of those 'either you'll love or hate it' videos.  Personally, I really like it.  It's good if you want an easy day (provided you don't use the power moves) and just a fun workout.  Gin jokes a lot with her crew, and some people find that annoying.  I don't, and will find myself laughing along with them.  Makes the workout more fun.  Not to mention you get a great 90s blast from the past with the 'hip hop' step routine.  :)

A+ in my book!",1412640000,,454,4.079545454545454
7875397,5,6304672985,"i have all the step reebok videos, and i had this one for years without even trying it. i then decided to give it a go and i enjoyed, and fair enough it not as intense as the other workouts, but you will have fun doing this workout and you'll laugh as well, because exercise is supposed to be fun. i would recommend this to anyone esp beginners or advanced exercisers who don't want a too intense workout. you'll have fun doing it.",1202169600,,431,4.204819277108434
7875398,4,6304672985,"Yes, the non-stop goofing around will eventually get on your nerves after you've done this workout a few times.  I definitely don't choose it on a day I need to burn off some serious life-related stress or frustration.  That's when I reach for Gilad's step workouts (friendly and encouraging, but he's definitely no nonsense).  But the combination of steps is different than any other workout and like most of Gin Miller's workouts, the time goes by very quickly.",1187395200,,463,4.910256410256411
7875399,4,6304672985,"Lot of differing opinions here!  I wouldn't want this to be my *only* step video, but as a change of pace and something fun, it's perfect.  If you are a 20-something and in top condition and looking for a challenge, then look elsewhere.  If you are a beginner or intermediate and have other videos to alternate with this one, then I recommend it as a fun and effective workout.  I like the goofing around with the ""team""--I suppose after many, many plays it might start to get old, but I don't find it annoying at all yet. Besides, that's Gin!",1087948800,,543,4.4
7875400,4,6304672985,"An upbeat compilation of 3 episodes from the Step TV ESPN series, which I've never seen, unfortunately. The first part of the video, basic step, is easy to catch on to, is a challenge if your step platform is high enough, and goes by quickly since the exercisers spend the whole time trying to be funny. The second segment--my favorite--is Power step, with more jumping, higher intensity moves, less joking around. The third segment, hip-hop step, is a nice concept, but the music isn't hip-hop (the music is pretty blah throughout the whole video actually), the dancy moves aren't at all challenging, and it seems to drag. Good beginner step video, and worthwhile for intermediate/advanced if you raise the platform to the tallest height.",1018828800,7,739,4.967741935483871
7875401,4,6304672985,"The Best of Step Reebok TV is a very unique workout that puts
together 3 step segments and one lower body stretch and cool
down segment hosted by Gin Miller.  The first segment (after
a 5 minute warmup) is a basic step workout.  I will admit that,
at first, I found this segment to be very annoying.  The four
other steppers add their own movements to the routine and
constantly make silly comments.  Miller is also more animated
than usual, several times talking like a hick for some reason.
The steppers are so silly it almost takes away from the workout.
I had problems following it at first.  After using this video several times, though, I've gotten used to it.
The second segment features power stepping that incorporates airborne moves.  This segment is 12 minutes long and is done a lot more seriously than the first segment (it also features different background steppers).
The final step segment is very unique.  It is called Hip Hop and
uses a variety of less traditional moves (the ""Marilyn Monroe,"" the ""King Kong,"" etc.).  A nice change of pace.  Miller
and the other steppers are a little silly in this one but not as bad.
Finally, there is a 4 minute stretch and cool down.  I feel time could have been taken from the 1st and 3rd segments and added to the stretches, as I feel this segment is way too short.
After seeing the silliness in this video, I thought it would not be a very good workout.  I was wrong.  This 53-minute video wears me out big time!  It is a challenging intermediate workout and I think advanced people will enjoy it as well for its variety.  I will admit, it is pretty fun at times.",1014854400,2,1622,4.4727891156462585
7875402,1,6304672985,"Gin Miller and Reebok have the best step videos around, but they should not have made this one.  It's boring and the constant chatter and laughing between the team annoyed me more than it bored me.  Try Reebok's other videos instead -- like the original step workout, the Power step workout, or Aerostep.",981676800,5,304,4.716981132075472
7875403,2,6304672985,"I can't imagine why Reebok thought this concept would be good.  First of all they took different pieces from different tapings of workouts and  pieced them together.  Of course you would get your heart rate up, enjoying  the current workout then they would change it.  I hated that.  And worse of  all they would pick up when everyone is just standing around waiting for  her to explain what they are about to do.  How annoying!  The only part  I actually enjoyed was the second session but of course that didn't last  long!",967593600,8,524,4.576086956521739
7875404,5,6304672985,The workout that you will get for Gene Miller and her crew is great. They are having so much fun in the video that it makes you want to do the workout every day.  You feel as if you are one of the crew members. I took  it step by step slowly until I could complet the entire work out.  I wish I  could find more of Gene Miller workouts.,947548800,,336,3.757142857142857
7875405,4,6304672985,"I like Gene Miller and her crew. It's a fun workout. I only wish they streched and warmed up more in the beginning and in the end of the video. The moves are easy to follow, just phsyically challening. I can't do the  whole tape. I skip over the hip hop section. The cool down at the end is  much too short. I usually do my own additional cool down. Great tape  though, I would buy more tapes with Gene Miller.",944006400,5,410,4.037037037037037
