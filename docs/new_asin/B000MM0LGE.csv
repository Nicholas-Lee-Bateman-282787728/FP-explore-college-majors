8169890,4,B000MM0LGE,"I saw this in the cinema, but as I recall I wasn't too impressed. Don't know why, it rocks!

Angela Mao Ying (Bruce Lee's sister from ""Enter the Dragon"") is great. Sammo Hung is pretty cool AND very slim! (Yep, it's so long ago!) There's plenty of action. In fact, my girlfriend said there were too many fights and it spoilt the story. Now how can you have too many fights in a martial arts movie!?

The story is the usual one school upsets another, yada, yada, yada...

If there's one regret it's that Wong In Sik (one of Lee's opponents in ""Return of the Dragon"") isn't used enough. You really need to see this guy kick!

And as for Ji Han Jae (one of Lee's opponents in ""Game of Death""), well, his part is very short, but wonderful.

Oh, and if you're really, really, really observant - and don't blink too often - you might even see Jackie Chan!

Yep, apart from some great action, part of the fun is spotting actors who starred in Bruce Lee movies.

Good movie.",1221177600,,966,4.303867403314917
