7805012,5,6300209318,I was four years old when I saw my first serial. That serial was The Masked Marvel. In my opinion is that this was one of my close second favs. I really enjoy the plots in the classic movies that to put it bluntly the ones today lack. I personly think that if our movies now a days had characters like Rex Bennet or Chang or Piar (sp) Our movies would do twice as much as they are now.,1130803200,,385,3.8860759493670884
7805013,5,6300209318,"serials were never known for great acting, writing or much of anything else.  However there are excetions to the rule, and this is one of them.  The plot may not be the freshest, and the nazis are about as stereotypical as they come, but some of the ideas that the writers came up with are quite amusing.  I especially enjoyed the fake German graveyard in Morrocco loaded with explosives.  Also, predictable as every fight scene is, the stunt coordinators and cameramen went out of their way to let everything look just a little bit different (my dad's got about forty serials, and Manhunt has by far the best fights of any of them, it's also in the top five for most amusing cliffhangers).  No other serial has the actors fighting at the camera (pardon the grammar, but there's no other way to put it).  The sets are also quite remarkable in that a large number of items are placed around for the actors to use.  Again don't be looking for a great story or good acting.  Just sit back and enjoy what passed for gratuitous violence in the 1940s.  It's definitely a winner.",996278400,7,1072,4.512953367875648
7805014,3,6300209318,"This is a typical cliffhanging serial with plenty of action and even good creativity, but ""someone forgot the jungle"".  Its painfully obvious this was shot in the foothills surrounding L.A. and unfortunately every episode winds up in in the same old fistfight, usually between ""wolf"" the Nazi spy and Rod Cameron, the American hero, not to mention the spear chucking arabs, who also become routine and who are dispatched by the dozen, usually accidentally, by their own kind, during the struggle for the gun and the never ending fist fights.  Okay, but no prize!",983577600,,562,4.968085106382978
7805015,3,6300209318,"If you want to study stock plots, standard characters and typical cliffhangers in Republic chapterplays, this is a good academic excesize.  But it is a VERY mediocre example of Republic serials generally....  While  ANYTHING from Republic's unit was better than 90% of the serials from other  studios, SECRET SERVICE IN DARKEST AFRICA (the original title)was perhaps  the beginning of the end of the Golden Age.  All but three chapters are  carbon-copies of one another:  two 4-man fistfights (each beginning with  Rex Bennet getting the pistol knocked out of his hand) per episode, one  shot of the captive Sultan Ben Ali mocking his Nazi captors, a  cross-country chase and an explosion at the end.  Sure, these are the  staples of serialdom, but here they are presented as ""bones without  flesh.""  For wartime Nazi-fighters in the serials, Spy Smasher (or any  similar Whitney-directed outing) is a better choice.",942451200,5,916,5.171232876712328
7805016,5,6300209318,"This is the high point of Republic serials, with action and special effects like nothing I've ever seen.
It's the fearless American agent matching wits with evil Nazi spies in Africa, and giving Hitler's cronies  the kay-o!
True, there are the sterotypical things that come with all  serials. The uncanny ability for heroes and villains alike not to be able  to hold on to a gun, Califonia doubling for every location on Earth (this  time it's Africa, sans black folks), and frequent fights that you KNOW are  gonna happen (usually because a cowboy Nazi spy was distracted and dropped  his gun), and bad guys never seeming to get captured for good and all until  the last chapter. But hey, that's half the fun!
This one is impressive,  and shows off the work of the famous effects wizards, the Lydecker  Brothers.
If you like serials, this one is action all the way!",934156800,5,866,4.682119205298013
