4500358,5,B004YLC0RM,"This is an excellent animated collection of stories that explain intangible yet vital values such as responsibility, honesty and reliability in ways toddlers can understand.",1388707200,2,173,5.96
4500359,5,B004YLC0RM,"We are doing the Fruits of the Spirit lessons right now, and each week we watch the corresponding lesson.  The kids look forward to this every week.  Though they don't talk about the spiritual aspect, most of them have a song at the end that links it to the fruit.  Highly recommended!",1360886400,2,285,4.4423076923076925
4500360,5,B004YLC0RM,My son is 4 and loves these DVDs. I like the fact that they are about cars which almost all four year old boys are into and that they also teach on godly moral character traits! We are big fans!,1310688000,7,194,3.875

8448503,1,B004YLC0RM,"I've never watched this series and was, unfortunately, very disappointed.  Whhhhyyy did they have to make the girl car, for a lack of better words, talk extremely valley girl?  It's horrible.  They couldn't just make her talk clear and normal?  That's not something you want rubbing off on a kid.  I'm sorry I couldn't get passed even a full episode.  Tried another one on the dvd and she was right there in the beginning as well.  There isn't a ton of Christian cartoons out there and I just don't understand what the creators of this series were thinking with that.",1473897600,,567,4.61

8448508,5,B004YLC0RM,"These are great, short videos that inspire kids to make good decisions and be faithful.  These are not too long and not too short...I can easily weave these into a church lesson, play for a time filler, etc without having to devote a half hour to a video.  They also appeal to elementary kids - which is great because some of the other short videos I have found are more geared towards preschoolers.",1426723200,,399,4.4520547945205475
