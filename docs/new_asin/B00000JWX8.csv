8569388,5,B00000JWX8,"One of the best from one of the most talented and prolific ""Children Of Bud"" this excellent DVD was also released as a CD  some different cuts ( as Ken Dryden at Almusic notes the CD itself has two different versions The contents of this Japanese CD, released in 1998 by Videoarts in Japan, is nearly identical to the 2000 Storyville issue At the Brewhouse, though ""St. Thomas"" is not included on the latter, two cuts are missing from the former, and the dates don't match, even though it is obvious that the matching tracks are the very same performances. Recommended.

Watch at home and play CD(s) in the car!!!!!!!!Just a terrific CD from end of a career that spanned early 50's to early 90's with one of his last and most sympathetic partners in NHOP and Alvin Queen. Would rank this as one the best trio performance DVD's that stands along side films like ""Round Midnight"" or documentaries like ""Straight No Chaser"" and Jazz On A Summers Day"".Probably have watched this and a concert by Paris Reunion Band more than any other of dozens of jazz DVD's I have. You'll repeat watch too.
Cheers

8569389,5,B00000JWX8,"In addition to the great music, this DVD has excellent footage of all the players (not just Kenny Drew) including closeups of their hand (and foot) techniques.  The trio members share the spotlight equally and hence the camera-time is quite evenly distributed among them although most of the solos are for Kenny Drew and NHP with one lengthy solo for Alvin Queen.  Queen does however still shine through on all the songs.
Kenny Drew is excellent without being too fancy and although NHP exhibits his usual electric-sounding tone as a result of his choice of amplification gear, his notes and intonation are faultless and impressive.
Watch out for the interesting introduction to St. Thomas from NHP and Alvin Queen.
If I could wish for just one thing it would be more songs as the trio plays only one set of five songs.  It makes me wonder whether there was another set that did not make it to the DVD for some reason.",1014422400,,918,4.654320987654321
