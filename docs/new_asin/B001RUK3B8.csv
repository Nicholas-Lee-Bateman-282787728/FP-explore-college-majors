8338908,5,B001RUK3B8,Gave this surprise to my daughter (born in '81). She loved She-Ra & even made a Halloween costume a few years ago. Great gift!,1430870400,,126,4.291666666666667
8338909,5,B001RUK3B8,"I bought this set a few years ago through a local store. It comes with lots of extras including commentary from the director and other behind the scenes people. I had purchased The Best of Shera several years before buying this set. It was good to collect the movie version of Shera's origin and the 5 separate episodes. This complete  set seems to contain all the episodes made, however, there was one I saw on Pay TV in 2005-2006 where Adora talks about how she found Spirit. This episode didn't make it to the set. Apart from missing that episode, it's a great set to own.
It's just a shame the writers didn't make any episodes where Shera and the Great Rebellion defeat the Horde and Adora has the choice to stay on Etheria or return to Eternia. I would have loved to see some episodes revealing the Crystal Castle's location, the Red Knight's identity revealed and King Micah's return to Bright Moon. It would also have been good to see some episodes where Adora and Adam can reveal their secret identities to their friends and family.",1421712000,2,1040,4.561497326203209
8338910,5,B001RUK3B8,"Remember how great this show was? I thought I did. Turns out, it was even BETTER. Watching this through an adult's eyes is incredibly fun after watching it through a kid's eyes years ago. It's worth buying these volumes together to save a little money, if you can. These are so nicely put together, from the artwork on the case, to the DVD artwork, to the menus and extras. The episodes themselves show so clearly and vibrantly on our TV, and the sound is clear. Sure wish English captions would have been included. The included art cards are fun, and the episode guide is VERY helpful for when trying to find out which disc has what episode. My kids have really enjoyed watching this (even my son), and I can't believe how excited they get when they find Lookee, a character I'd totally forgotten about. Love the non-man-hating female empowerment in the story lines, and that (unlike He-Man) Adora/She-Ra is perfectly fine with a little romance.

Now... I only wish Season 2 wasn't so RIDICULOUSLY expensive to buy!",1361145600,5,1016,4.707865168539326
8338911,5,B001RUK3B8,"I am not a fan of She-Ra by any means but I ordered this as a gift for my wife for her birthday. I shopped around first, and let me tell you this two pack was the way to go. It was much cheaper than buying the two seperate volumnes of the first season. My wife loved it and was very excited about recieving it. In all honesty, I watched parts of the set with her and was impressed by it. It reminded me of watching He-Man as a child and I found these episodes enjoyable. I will say that these are from the era of violence free cartoons so the violence is very dialuted and done with the use of ray-guns and other proposterious contraptions. If you remember this from you childhood it will just be a funny throwback tot he cartoons you watched as a kid.",1239062400,5,752,4.087837837837838
