I want a refund! I'm really pissed, he's super disappointed too, and I'm 21 plus dollars in the hole for the dud you guys shipped me.",1483747200,,341,3.8714285714285714

8466326,5,B0000E3HLD,"This DVD is much much better than the ""Way We Walk"" DVD.  The set list is top notch. It opens with ""Mama"" and finishes with ""Turn It On Again.""  In between are many great Genesis songs including the amazing and very enjoyable drum duet with Phil and Chester Thompson. That alone is worth buying this.
5.1 Surround Sound?  How can you go wrong?  You can't! You won't be disapointed.....pick this up!",1069459200,3,398,4.563380281690141
