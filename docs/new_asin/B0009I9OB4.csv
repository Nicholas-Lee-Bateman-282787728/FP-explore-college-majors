8061137,2,B0009I9OB4,"I like bad B movies more than most, but with the exception of Future Force these are all pretty bad, by which I mean tedious. Future Force is ok if you're a Carradine fan. Here's a quick recap just so you know what you're getting into if you decide to buy this. Honestly, if you're burning with curiousity over these movies do yourself a favor and rent them first.

FUTURE FORCE- This is quintessential 80's sci-fi cheese. David Carradine, sporting a full-on beer gut AND tighter than tight jeans plays John Tucker, the toughest member of C.O.P.s, a mercenary law enforcement agency. When a cute young TV reporter accuses Tucker's boss of general evilness and corruption, they take to the road in an attempt to save her life and bring the nasty Fat Cat down. Hot on their trail is legendary Bad-A$$ Robert Tessier. Carradine also sports a flying, lightning-shooting cyborg arm. When you're half in the bag, you could do much worse!

STAR KNIGHT-An alien (Klaus Kinski) in a spaceship flies over a medieval town. The villagers think he's a knight riding a dragon. He falls for a local princess, who has caught the eye of Sir Harvey Keitel. It's pretty plodding and pointless although it's amusing watching a (probably) high Harvey Keitel stumble around reciting Shakespeare-style dialogue in his New York accent.

FINAL DAYS OF PLANET EARTH-This should have been called the Final Days of Broadcast TV movies. It's more or less a cheap copy of the great 80's mini-series ""V"", except the aliens are insects instead of reptiles. And that nowadays I think Darryl Hannah really looks like that.

LAST SENTINEL-When technology turns against humanity.....blah blah blah! Don Wilson is a Drone Soldier who rescues resistance fighter Lt. Starbuck from sure death and mentors her on how to ""think like a computer"" so she can save humanity. You've seen this story a million times before, but rarely is it this told with this much tediousness. There is, at least, a wise-cracking gun.",1265673600,3,1971,4.874626865671642
