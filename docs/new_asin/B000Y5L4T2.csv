8230980,5,B000Y5L4T2,"David Asscherick is a very fact based, no non-sense speaker. He is a convert from atheism, not a life long Christian. If you've ever heard any of his numerous other messages you'll note that he is seeking truth for  Biblical and doctrinal variences, not just what he's been told by parents, pastors, etc.
This short film is very inspirational, poses good answers for tuff questions and gives a solid agument for the existance of God. But, if you've made up your mind that God does not exist, well, then you've made up your mind. But you can not avoid the inevidable questions: Where do I come from? for what purpase am I here?, how am I supposed to live my life? and WHERE am I going after this life?
It is suposed to be a start of other short films on similiar topics but nothing else so far as I know. If your searching for truths about God, this is a good start.",1233187200,9,865,4.306748466257669
