8277524,2,B001AHPB5Q,"The Unsolved History series deals with some intriguing topics and does a great deal of original and occasionally even ingenious research, but the presentation is so poor it is sometimes difficult to watch. Kathleen Kerr, the narrator for the first 2 seasons, is so boring and tedious, pro-nounc-ing ev-er-y syl-la-ble in a slow, life-less mon-o-tone, that you really have to be fascinated in the subject matter to stay awake.  I felt like I was back in the first grade, the teacher carefully sounding out each word for me so I wouldn't misconstrue what Jack and Jill were actually doing up on that hill.
The other problem with the show, particularly noticable on the dvd where there are no commercials, is that they repeat and re-summarize every point and every tidbit of information at least three times.  With a little tighter writing (and a narrator that speaks like a normal human being), the Discovery Channel could have produced a series of excellent half-hour shows. Instead, they chose to produce an hour-long series padded out with long-winded platitudes and repititious tripe.",1271894400,3,1086,5.06145251396648
8277525,3,B001AHPB5Q,"Unsolved History is a fantastic series.  The episodes are well-produced and do a great job presenting complex topics in an interesting and illuminating manner.  The ""Killing Hitler"" episode alone is a must-have for anyone who has seen the recent Valkyrie film.  Unfortunately, presentation is simply awful.  Each disc contains two episodes with no menus or even the ability to jump to the second episode.  The chapter markers are in apparently random points in the programs.  A simple chapter marker immediately before the second episode on each disc is sadly nonexistent.  FYI, the description is somewhat misleading.  The discs do not contain 720 minutes of programming.  That figure is likely based on 60 minutes per epsisode, but the true length is closer to 45 minutes, totaling 540 minutes.  Also, online episode guides list season 2 of this series with many more episodes than are contained in this set.  Here is a list of the episodes you will be buying: San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, Death of Princess Diana, Death of Marilyn Monroe, Aztecs: Temple of Blood, The Great Chicago Fire, Donner Party, Roswell, Salem Witch Trials, St. Valentine's Day Massacre, JFK, The Plots to Kill Lincoln, Killing Hitler",1232582400,15,1215,5.116751269035533
8277526,2,B001AHPB5Q,"I was SO excited to find this DVD set!  I am going to be a history teacher in the fall and I thought showing an episode or two in my classes was a great idea. However, I was disappointed with the quality of this DVD set.  First, the discs themselves are not labeled, there are 6 total and they all look the same. There is no menu, pamphlet (whatever it's called) inside the DVD case that tells you what episodes are on what disc. Third, there is no menu and/or chapter selection when watching a disc, so you have to skip or fast forward to get to the second episode.  When watching an episode, there are also way too many stalling moments. For $40 the quality should be way better! I would probably return the set except this is sort of one of a kind unless you want to spend more money and buy the episodes individually. This show is not even listed on the Discovery Channel website anymore. It should be us teachers need resources. Frustrating!",1232496000,9,946,4.333333333333333
