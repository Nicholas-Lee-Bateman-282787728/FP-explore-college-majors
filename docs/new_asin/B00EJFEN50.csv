5921225,5,B00EJFEN50,"Part of the superb PBS/BBC Mystery Masterpiece series, this taught legal (UK style) thriller will hold you in its strong grip until the end.  David Tennant stars as Will Burton, a winning barrister who has never lost a case and known for getting clients out of impossibly tight legal corners, thus his nick-name The Escape Artist.  But when Burton gets accused serial killer Liam Foyle (Tony Kebbell) acquitted and set free on a technicality, its only a matter of time before Foyle kills again and this time its personal.  Now Burton must repress his primal instincts as a courtroom rival (Sophie Okonedo) defends Foyle for the murder of [WARNING: Possible Spoiler Alert] Burtons wife! What was once a benign intellectual exercise for Burton is now a visceral reality.  The 180-minute three-part story has elegant composition and nourish, atmospheric lighting.  The subtle direction by Brian Welsh from an original, intelligent and twisty screenplay by David Wolstencraft makes this one to watch.",1403222400,3,996,5.2

5921227,4,B00EJFEN50,"As I post this review (in early June 2014) there is one review, apparently based on the version that aired on PBS.I want to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical or TV version here as well as reviews of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by Most Recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to my review of the Bluray version (I received an advance copy since the release date is June 17th. As I understand it the bonus features are the same on both the DVD and BD for this release.

If you have read my other reviews on Amazon, you would know that Im a huge fan of both British and Australian mystery and crime series DVDs released by PBS, BBC Home Video and Acorn Home Video.  And I don't believe in providing spoilers in my reviews. These series were created to have the viewer be surprised.

This film was produced by the BBC but also aired in the US on PBS on Masterpiece Mystery in an edited version. It is a three-episode series, with each episode lasting about 58 minutes. (For PBS, the edits were made for two reasons: 1) to allow the promos for other PBS shows and 2) for both language and violence (which has been more acceptable to British audiences). For this release PBS Home Video has left the Masterpiece intro but has provided the Original UK Version. While I did not watch the PBS-TV version, I will point out that there are some gruesome graphics as well as strong language (the S-word for one) in the version included here.

Ill leave a few other reviewers to discuss the details of the plot  though I don't like spoilers. The one previous reviewer has already told you who was murdered (which was better as a surprise, in my opinion).  This is not so much as a mystery as a legal and court drama combined with a thriller.  And, while there are some action moments  again, pretty graphic, there are some fairly slow court procedure scenes that slow things down.
I did like the story but I cant say I loved it, when compared with similar shows. It just seemed  even at three hours  a bit too drawn out. And, yes, the purpose of the script is to question ethical issues of the legal system, but the viewer is still left with their own reasoning as to whether they would have acted as the central character here (an attorney who never loses a case, even getting murderers released on technicalities) did.

The BD (and DVD)  has two bonus features: interviews with actor David Tennant (from Doctor Who series) and writer/creator David Wolstencroft. Both are edited so that you only hear the answers and unlike some interview segments  there are no scenes from the show inserted. The Wolstencroft runs about 11 minutes and the Tennant one 13 minutes. While each is fairly informative for the first five minutes or so, the subjects begin repeating themselves (and Tennant actually stutters his way through his comments  surprising for an actor) and so Im not sure these bonuses add very much.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5921228,5,B00EJFEN50,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!

The Escape Artist tackles the difficult question of what to do when law fails you. Will Burton, up-and-coming junior barrister has never lost a case, and it is his intricate knowledge of the ins and outs of the legal system that he can finagle a victory out of even the toughest cases. But when he accepts the responsibility of representing a suspected rapist and murderer named Liam Foyle, Will begins to question the morality of what he's doing. At one point, he tells his wife in a depressed voice, ""The world is broken."" Regardless of how he feels, Will pursues the case to the end, and pulls another victory for his defendant.
Will's comfortable world is up-ended when his wife is brutally murdered, and he finds himself in a position of helplessness as the law he'd supposedly tried so hard to uphold, fails to bring the murderer to justice. Will realizes now, how the family members of Liam Foyle's victim must have felt.
The choices Will makes in the final episode pose an important question to the viewer. His actions are morally questionable and legally wrong, but at the same time justifiable. What would you do, if the person who murdered someone you loved was not brought to justice? You know they're going to kill again, and their next victim might very well be you or a loved one. If the legal system that is intended to protect you, instead allows killers to walk free simply because of a technicality, what would you do? Would take the same path that Will did? It's something to ponder.

I would recommend this show to anyone over the age of 18.

5921229,5,B00EJFEN50,"David Tenant plays hotshot barrister Will Burton who has yet to lose a case and is the darling of his chambers and the envy of his rivals, chief among whom is Maggie Gardner (Sophie Okonedo).  Will is happily married to Kate (Ashley Jensen) and they have a young son, Jamie (Gus Barry).  The series opens as Will successfully defends a particularly nasty client, Liam Foyle (Toby Kebbell), on trial for murder, by spotting a legal technicality in the prosecution case, and chalks up another victory, at the expense of prosecuting counsel, the aforementioned Maggie.

We get glimpses of Foyles domestic circumstances, which leaves us in very little doubt that this is a very odd individual indeed.  One would, of course, have expected the not guilty verdict to have invoked within the accused a feeling of gratitude towards the person securing his freedom.  However, with this individual abnormal is normal and things take a horrible turn for the worse at the expense of Will, his family and their continued well-being.

Following on from the equally outstanding, What Remains, this first rate film, originally aired on BBC as three one hour episodes, is suitably eerie with gothic overtones.  As might be expected the whole cast is magnificent, with Toby Kebbell outstanding as the creepily evil Foyle.  It examines the usual law story themes of guilt, retribution and the nature of justice and is a right up there with the best of BBC drama.",1396483200,2,1442,4.954356846473029

5921231,5,B00EJFEN50,"This film is brilliantly well acted by the three lead actors beginning with David Tennant as Will Burton the talented junior barrister ( lawyer in America)  #1 under age 40 and the escape artist of the film for getting his clients out of sticky legal problems until it turns on him. Sophie Okonedo is Will's rival and #2 under age 40, who would do anything to beat Will.  Toby Kebbell is truly brilliant and scary as the abnormal; serial killer Liam Foyle.  I at first thought this was going to be a typical British court movie - but that soon went out the window by the end of the first episode, to be replaced by more of a Hitchcock thriller. This is a brilliant fast paced roller coaster ride between all the emotions. Watch for all the plot twist in this film, be sure to watch closely the last 30 min.  Now their are a few plot holes, like why does the wife go back to the cottage alone with just her son.  Next I do have a problem with the whole violence against women thing - but the story is very good and until society changes their values - we are stuck with these type of stories.  Next - The moral questions  of Law VS Justice .  If nothing else this film will at least make you think about some of these issues.  This film is a region 2 DVD which can only be played on a multi region DVD player about $20 or $30 or on your computer.  I bought my copy from AmazonUK.com for about $20.00 with shipping, it might be more now since I preordered mine.  Well worth getting and watching.",1389916800,2,1493,4.203508771929824

5921238,3,B00EJFEN50,"SPOILER ALERT

I have to agree with many of the reviewers on Imdb ( and some here)  :  the writing lets this production down.  The storyline is just not credible and after watching the first episode and the synopsis for the second and third episodes, I am not watching further.  Strangely enough here there are a lot of positive reviews with just a few mentioning the writing.  Completely different to what is on imbd where the ""nays' have it (due to the writing).

If you look down the list of reviews on imdb,  almost every single one has a ""spoiler alert"" - that should tell you something; namely that the plot line is so ridiculous everyone feels the need to mention it in their review.  I don't usually reveal plot either, but there's no choice here.

I see someone said that the full version (which this is not) was much better.  Well it would have to be.  But even a more full version cannot excuse the ridiculous plot line which as many have said here, is totally unbelievable.

I was raised in the Uk but have lived in the US for 26 years.  I find it completely implausible that Burton would have been able to get Foyle off such a high profile ""heinous"" crime with a technicality as ridiculous as credit card charges for pornography.  Totally not believeable.

Then, the wife would have known about the case.  Any Mother would have mentioned to her husband that there was a man waving at their son from the street below.  And then, any woman who was in a cottage in the country who looks out the window whilst in her bath to see a strange man looking in at her would describe him (he was clearly visible) to her husband and the police and they would all deduce it was Foyle.  Add to that the fact that Foyle has now complained to the Legal authorities about Burton's ""Misconduct' after he actually got him off the charge.... um.. I don't think that a top Legal Barrister is stupid.  So then the wife goes back at night to the cottage in the country ALONE with the son instead of waiting for her husband?  And he lets her?  Just a few days/weeks later?  Nonsense!!!!!

Then apparently, in episode 2 which I will not be watching, even though Burton sees Foyle standing outside after he finds his blood covered wife and says so, the other Barrister gets Foyle bail?  Someone who has now been accused TWICE of brutal murder and torture?  When the person testifying he saw him standing outside is a top legal Barrister?  I'm sorry but what country is this?  Simply would not happen.

I watched this because I really appreciate David Tennant and from the synopsis I thought I was going to be watching a really good legal drama.  How wrong I was.  David's acting is as always excellent and wow!  Toby Kebbell is one outstanding young actor.  Without ever touching his victims onscreen or any kind of weapon in his hands, he just portrayed the ultimate psycho creep to a T.

So for me, it was disappointing and rather disturbing to have something portrayed in this way.  I gave it 3 stars for the acting and overall production but the storyline, dreadful.

To the reviewer who had not seen Tennant in anything else but Dr. Who and thus realized ""oh he can really act"". watch him in ""Broadchurch"" which unlike this, is a brilliant murder series set in the UK (Dorset) starring Tennant and - like this - a fabulous supporting cast.",1502496000,,3330,4.491666666666666
5921239,4,B00EJFEN50,"This well-produced video of a good story sometimes seems incomplete. Another reviewer references deletions from an original I have not seen, causing me to wonder whether they account for perceived gaps in the story line. If so, that would be be unfortunate. Plenty of scenes could have been sacrificed instead. For example, it is difficult to understand how a winning client's ""my attorney didn't like me, boo hoo"" would have legs in a unprofessional conduct complaint. Animosity was otherwise clear, so everything concerning that charge could have been deleted.

Although confusion is unrelated to possible editing, I find another ethics issue hard to understand. In circumstances presented, why would it be unethical for an attorney appearing as a witness to suggest additional theories for the case or sources of evidence?",1501718400,,825,5.346153846153846

5921245,5,B00EJFEN50,"This was an interesting and well done series that drew me into the characters.  The story line is taunt, and combined with the character depth, each one-hour segment went fast.

5921246,1,B00EJFEN50,"This was so bad that I've been left in a bit of a bad mood over the time wasted watching this show and lack of any kind of positive I could take away from it. It blows my mind that there are writers so unimaginative that this story line was the best they could come up with. The performances from the adult cast members also weren't great. People loving David Tennant is the only reason I can think of why the ratings for this show are so high. Watch Happy Valley, Grantchester, or the first two seasons of Broadchurch instead.",1496880000,3,527,4.28
5921247,5,B00EJFEN50,"British dramas are interesting because of how pathetic many of the protagonists are by American standards.  In a British drama, lets say the protagonist's wife or daughter were brutally raped and murdered.  Regardless of how horrid the crime was against the protagonist's loved one, like a good Brit, he'd agonize over his desire for revenge, do whatever possible to seek a trial and prison time, but he'd certainly never stoop to serving mortal justice(aka finding and killing the guy).  Now, in America, we all know what would happen.  Keiffer Sutherland would find the evil villain and disect him piece by piece or Mel Gibson would shove a stick of dynamite up his....or Kevin Cosner would run up to the guy asking ""are you the one that shot my brother"", then without missing a beat, he'd draw his 6-shooter and blow the bad guy away.  And, we'd all cheer!  But, not so much in British TV.  Culturally, the people are more opposed to violence as a form a justice and guns as the tool of choice.  For that reason, I'm normally disgusted at British dramas like one.  But, never fear, David Tenant, plays a superb protagonist who's (spoiler alert!!!) wife is brutally murdered.  It appears to be a typical Brit drama at first with a pathetic protagonist unable or unwilling to avenge his beloved wife....but then...oh, it's a beautiful twist and a fabulous ending.  He's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, and he absolutely delivers in this short series.",1495670400,,1463,4.835341365461847

Two-stars may be harsh given that the acting in the Escape Artist  was good to excellent.
However, is the thinness of the plot, the legal finessing (not) and the fact that evil wins out over good in such gross measure so early on - in deed all this that sharply limits the film's entertainment value for me.
How can you give Masterpiece two stars, you ask? Well, it's first. The series i's not at all 'taut,' but it is dark; hope is eclipsed before the first episode's credits role. Where does one go from here that would make it interesting? The trajectory of the storyline does not hold much interest.",1492646400,4,740,4.556390977443609

The identity theft ""conclusion"" was ""supported"" by a forensic review of the murderer's computer showing no signs of sadistic pornography.  That reminded me of the Boston office of the Freaky Burro of Instigation claiming that the wrongfully released confidential personal information file about all US military veterans ""could not"" have been *copied*, a process which leaves no trace when implemented.

For example, I don't understand why this murderer kept getting his cases completely dismissed. This would never happen in the US under the shows circumstances. Also, a respected attorney as an eye witness is EXCELLENT. I can't believe this would not get a conviction in the UK. Ridiculous.",1483747200,4,573,5.085106382978723

5921291,4,B00EJFEN50,"The acting is great as other reviewers have noted. As also noted, I agree that the plot line seems contrived.

The female lawyer also walks alone late at night along deserted streets.

5921463,3,B00EJFEN50,"The Escape Artist is a thriller made for BBC 1 in 2013, when it was shown in three parts. It was shown as one full-length film on PBS in the United States. The protagonist is hot shot barrister Will Burton (David Tennant) whose perfect record he has never lost a case- earned him the sobriquet The Escape Artist. He is approached by Peter Simkins (Roy Marsden), solicitor for a man accused of the torture-murder of a young woman, who asks that Burton take on his clients case. Repulsed but opportunistic, Burton agrees to defend Liam Foyle (Tony Kebbell) against charges that he re-enacted violent acts that he had seen in porn films upon the victim. The Crown is forced to dismiss the case, and Foyle walks free. But someone is stalking Burtons wife Kate (Ashley Jensen), Foyle has accused Burton of misconduct, and junior barrister Maggie Gardner (Sophie Okonedo) has her sights set on a career that will equal or best that of her famous colleague.

The Escape Artist might make decent light entertainment, if it were light. The crimes depicted are horrific; the culprit is deranged and manipulative; and the protagonist is obsessed to the point of self-destruction. Not light entertainment. The problem with it as heavy entertainment is that the characters act in ways that are entirely implausible. Sophie Okonedo deserves credit for making Maggie distasteful, but the character is too smug and stupid to be believed. Likewise, Burtons disregard for his sons wellbeing and Foyles remarkable talent for leaving murder scenes and corpses devoid of his DNA are unconvincing. Foyle is an egomaniac who firmly believes he can get away with anything and demands similarly strong convictions from those around him. Tony Kebbell conveys that well, but its not much use, as Foyle is simply not a credible villain. The cast is talented, but, with credibility strained in every scene, The Escape Artist loses the audience fast.",1469318400,,1920,5.0

That said, this would be a fascinating story no matter who was in it.  The 'nub' of the story goes all the way back to Cicero-- even a guilty man deserves an energetic defense in an adversarial court system, but is justice served if a guilty man is freed by a brilliant lawyer?  And in this case, what if the freed defendant is a sociopath, so offended when his defense attorney refuses to shake his hand that he murders the attorney's wife?
When justice fails, revenge comes to the fore, and only a brilliant defense attorney can get justice in what many people would call murder.  But can he convince the jury of his innocence?",1465171200,2,774,4.429577464788732

5921615,4,B00EJFEN50,"Enjoyed this show.  David Tennant is brilliant as always and carries the 3 episodes.  If you are a fan of his then it is certainly worth the watch. The swerves were predictable, and most of the characters were one dimensional but it still played as solid suspenseful and often dark TV.  As often happens however, the female characters get a bad deal, either portrayed as victims, gullible/crazy, or just nasty and jealous. There is a lot of room for improvement in that area should they run another season.  The first episode was strongest and final was weakest IMO. It has a Cape Fear, Lincoln Lawyer feel.

5921817,5,B00EJFEN50,"Reminds me of the book/movie ""A perfect murder"". This unassuming, handsome, tragic barrister is able to execute the most delightfully well thought-out justice for avenging his wife's murder (and stopping the killer from doing it again, which is more than hinted at in the show). It's vendetta killing at its best, bc the adversary isn't just the law working against him, well-oiled bureaucracies designed to impeded true justice, it's a conflicted brilliant foil who plays his 2nd best barrister in England, the exotic and lovely actress Sophie Okonedo, who doesn't quite know whether or not she's on his side. The only few details that bother me about this show is despite his wonderful plot, there are some weird things that just don't make sense. For example, refraining to question the child (until the child spontaneously decides to blurt out some miraculous incriminating details of the crime scene). Also, the notion that DNA evidence at a crime scene as well as the eyewitness testimony of a top barrister AND child are not somehow admissible in court, but the laboratory that analyzed the DNA which was reprimanded for sterilization techniques IS (which is a matter of routine I'm sure) Ironically if you analyze this movie legally, it sort of falls apart on its own legal standing. But as far as entertainment goes, excellent stuff.",1452556800,,1342,5.04954954954955

It winds up a little quickly for my tastes and doesn't give you a lot of development time for tension. Characters do things for inexplicable reasons.

5921846,3,B00EJFEN50,"The escape artist is one of the best acted crappy tv shows you'll ever see.  Everyone in the show does a great job, Tennant is wonderful as a British defense lawyer, Toby Kebbel is supremely creepy as the murder suspect, every single actor does a wonderful job.  The premise is excellent, a defense lawyer defends a client he thinks is guilty of murder and gets him off, only to have the client murder someone close to him afterwards.  And yet the show can't escape from it's horrible plot!

Too many people have to be incompetent, too many bad coincidences have to take place for the series to work.  It's frustrating because with a little more work this could have been a great series but instead it only rises to mediocre.",1448064000,9,725,4.546153846153846

They completely redeemed the mediocre writing, and the thoroughly predictable, and possibly plagiarized plot.  The first part; lawyer never lost a case, gets off serial killer, but karma's a bitch.  The second part of the plot comes from the writers watching too much American TV.  It's almost completely lifted from ""the Case of the Killer Kiss"" except of course the murderer gets away with it.  Unfortunately this has been something that is happening a lot with Masterpiece mystery shows.  I know there is no such thing as an original plot, but geez!",1439596800,,654,4.846846846846847

However, as it continued (once I decided to come back to it), it becomes a more and more interesting ride, taking a turn that REALLY makes watching worthwhile. Of course, it is a totally different experience than Broad Church, and Tenant's character here has none of the brooding quirks one came to love in his detective role. But The Escape Artist, a quicker series, won the Broad Church-withdrawing Basketball Buff over, who is not a patient viewer and will go back to browse-mode if a mystery isn't mysterious enough.

The family dynamic at the beginning is adorable, and their life appears nearly perfect until tragedy strikes. Everything changes and somehow Foyle gets away with it--twice. I didn't know where the story was going, but then it takes a turn and my mouth almost literally dropped. I didn't think it would end that way, but I also can't say I wasn't happy about it, either. I was hesitant to watch this at first because I thought it was going to be too close to Broadchurch, which is just brilliant and has no compare, but it has its own unique story line and characters. While I watched Broadchurch, I spent the entire time trying to figure out who did it along with the cops; this show, on the other hand, we already know who did it, the question is whether the lawyers can prove it or not.

5922104,5,B00EJFEN50,"4.5 Stars, for those who make such distinctions.
An excellent effort with only minor quibbles, which I'm not even sure I remember at the moment.
Three episodes  like an old-timey U.S. mini-series that are many things: well-paced (check the story's progress at the end of each episode); both clever/witty/sharp *and* smart/thoughtful/incisive (usually you get neither, sometimes one or the other, this time both); and the switcheroo at the end is a subtle double-doublecross, so to speak, which, as a double-negative, brings it all back to the right thing with no tricks.
I'd watch it again, and it's not even a movie, exactly.
And I still can't remember the quibbles.

But before becoming Doctor 10, he starred in no less important and beautiful films. The film ""The Escape Artist"" was shot recently. And in this tense and dramatic film David played the role of a successful lawyer. It seemed that his life will always be the best. He has a brilliant career, a beautiful wife and adorable son. Nothing will be able to outshine his human happiness. But unfortunately, it was an illusion. The reality was more terrifying and uncompromising. The confrontation of the hero David with a serial killer, cost him the loss of all the valuable and expensive life. Eventually he was able to punish the murderer, but at heart still remained empty. This is the best British Thriller, created in recent years!",1432771200,,896,4.713375796178344

5922207,1,B00EJFEN50,"this is the worst drama I have ever seen on PBS. The acting from almost all actors, especially the main character is appalling.

5922277,2,B00EJFEN50,"Violent, somewhat interesting, but characters are not realistic.  In my 6+ decades of life, I've not encountered such 2 dimensional people.  Of all the characters, the young son of the lead character is the best actor, and most believable.  The series, going for a modern, more American look, seems to forget that people under stress, following the brutal murder of their wife, would not always be so perfectly appointed, down to the hair style when other wise distraught by the heinous crime committed against his wife.  The Villian/murderer reminds me of an old horror movie star, Vincent Price.  Like Price, this guy uses ominous looks, cryptic references and back ground music to raise the hair on the back of your neck, rather than really getting into the mind and actions of the person he's playing.  I'm disappointed as the first episode was the best, and the following have become increasingly more s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d- out (because they could) with less and less plot or story apparent.

5922284,1,B00EJFEN50,"The main theme is emotional exploitation.  The writers apparently don't know (and didn't research) anything about trial or police procedure -- that merely would have gotten in the way of creating the total victimhood atmosphere they were striving for.  Apparently they weren't clever enough (or good enough) to get the plot trajectory they wanted without playing fast and loose with reality.

Maybe the series has a political/ethical cause -- maybe they are going to comment on the effect of Britain's effectively outlawing citizen self-defense.  (What could go wrong with that, you know?).
Tennant's character also seems to have a complete lack of common sense, in that he can't figure our how to protect his family even when given enough warning to reach through any amount of stupidity -- and he's supposed to be a brilliant lawyer.

After being kicked in the gut by the (poorly written, exploitative) first show, I'm not the slightest bit interested in following up to find out.",1430352000,2,982,5.074534161490683

5922505,5,B00EJFEN50,"As is true with most anything David Tennant, this is an amazingly well-acted show. I recommend it highly, but should also give a warning here. It is a very dark, intense drama, like Broadchurch, only much more so. If you are opposed to seeing evil on open display, move along to something else. This one is NOT for the squeamish. Not because of the graphic displays of violence, of which there are a few, but just because of the feeling you will come away with after viewing. One thing it will do, though, is make you think about how you would react in similar circumstances. It is above all a wonderful study of good vs. evil. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

I watched the first episode late one evening, thinking I would watch the first one and then go to bed. After seeing it, I had to stay up and watch a couple of sitcom reruns to bring me out of the dark place this took me. But having seen the first one, there's no way I could avoid going back to see how it developed.",1425168000,,967,4.255434782608695

This disappointing effort centers on a low-key barrister and his uninteresting family, none of whom are real or engaging enough to make viewer identification with them very likely.

5922581,4,B00EJFEN50,"Provocative challenge to one of the hallmarks of the modern legal system--that everyone accused of a crime deserves a vigorous defense. If you can ignore some of the implausible legal maneuvering in the court room scenes, the remainder is a cleverly set up legal thriller. It may not always seem like it as you go along, but the clues are there and I found the story ultimately satisfying, (personally, if not as a criminal defense lawyer, who does believe that everyone, even guilty people, deserve to have the government properly prove it has the right to lock them up.)

David Tennant is in top form, displaying a wide range of emotions beautifully as the barrister who finds his life turned upside down and his world-view challenged. His Scottish BAFTA for the role was well-deserved. Sophie Okonedo is lovely as his court room nemesis, balancing professional hunger with human compassion. Toby Kebbell is chillingly good as the offended offender. It's a great ensemble.

There are some graphic scenes in the first episode, but that does not carry into the remaining three--although there are brief glimpses of photos. The violence is not shown, just the result.  I believe it brings home the terror experienced by the characters and highlights in an instant how things have changed in their world.

I was disappointed to discover that the Masterpiece Theater DVD I ordered had a couple of scenes missing from the series I watched on PBS, which evidently were cut from the BBC version. They are not essential to the plot, but without those scenes, some that followed might be a bit confusing, lacking context. . Once I got the DVD and examined it, the cover has the PBS logo, and  says Masterpiece Mystery, but it also says, at the very bottom, ""Original UK Edition"".",1421539200,2,1771,4.870431893687708

5922624,4,B00EJFEN50,"For those who admire the British genre of crime show, specifically focusing on her criminal justice system, this is a winner. For those of you who believe that that offender's rights, even serial killers, often trump the right of the victim, this series will cause distress, and even anger.

The premise of this drama is a psychopathic murderer, who is initially acquitted of murder by David Tennant's character, a defense barrister, stalks Tennants characters
 family after the acquittal, and ultimately kills his pregnant wife. Though evidence exists tying the killer to the murder, clever machinations by his new Defense attorney allows him to walk out of court, a free man. Hard to stomach but it does happen.

The character of the serial killer is so real, one begins to loathe him immediately; He is cunning, manipulative, sociopathic and dangerous...and has a deadly allergy to shellfish that will kill him if exposure takes place...I won't spoil the rest of the plot for anyone who choses to watch, but suffice it to say, the killer is taken care of in a karmic ending. Not in court mind you, but life has a way of dealing with this serial murderer, who possesses no conscience, no empathy, no sense of wrongdoing but infinite joy in murder and mayhem...a riveting drama...I left off a star as I felt the ending a bit too contrived...but nonetheless a great ride.",1419984000,,1371,4.875536480686695

5922665,3,B00EJFEN50,"I love these actors, and I love BBC (or PBS) detective/crime shows.  So I'm enjoying watching the actors.  But the plot is deeply unsatisfying, highly improbable and if that was how a 'real' court of law functioned - no evidence gathering, no interviewing, etc. etc. we'd all be pretty disturbed.
I kept thinking of the fabulous series 'Prime Suspect' with Helen Mirren, or 'Broadchurch', of which I've watched one season and am happily awaiting the second.  The show does raise the question of what is legally, procedurally correct v. what is justice.  Obviously both barristers had the 'legally correct' approach come back and slam them hard.  So, great actors, almost ludicrous plot.",1419465600,,686,5.089285714285714

5922668,3,B00EJFEN50,Very good acting from David Tenant but very intense and gruesome.  I would not watch again,1419465600,,90,4.625
5922669,5,B00EJFEN50,"Even with the fact of having a hard time understanding the Scottish and British accents, the story and the acting was excellent and will give it a 5 star.

5922672,4,B00EJFEN50,"After watching Gracepoint, and then sampling Broadchurch to see where Gracepoint originated (abandoned it after one episode after realizing how closely Gracepoint followed the British original), we tried this 3-episode Tennant vehicle, which I rate more highly than the others I've mentioned. It's tighter (well just 3 episodes, after all), and it lacked the sometimes exasperating red herrings of the longer series. Quite a tidy, tight, suspenseful diversion. After one episode, you might find it hard to put off the next episode.",1419292800,,531,5.487804878048781

Not knowing enough about Britain's legal system, I can't tell how likely it is that cases against the accused would be so easily dismissed; wouldn't happen here for sure and do they not have state prosecutors? . David Tennant is brilliant as usual. The script certainly has some holes in it but all in all the short serial is gripping and well done.",1419206400,,412,4.657534246575342

5922696,5,B00EJFEN50,"An excellent illustration of the difference between ""innocent"" and ""not guilty,"" this series has several twists and turns that will leave you at the edge of your seat. It's one thing for a lawyer to be philosophical about the need for everyone to have a defense, but quite another when things start to get too close. David Tennant (Will Burton) is a terrific actor, too, with a wide range of abilities, well worth watching. Toby Kebbell (Liam Foyle) does a great job of making his character creepy in a very calm and calculated way.",1418688000,,532,4.670212765957447

The acting is a bit forced, other than that of the villain. And when all the pieces finally roll into place, you can't help but feel gyped, as if PBS tricked you with this court setting and literally getting away with murder. Much better to watch the similar, but immensely better BBC production, SILK; it's a similar British barrister setting, but the writing and acting put this PBS production to shame.",1415923200,,598,4.650943396226415

I must admit, though, that I thought the hero was incredibly stupid to send his wife and son back to their country home without him, when they had been threatened the first time.

5922868,5,B00EJFEN50,"David Tennant is a much better actor than I thought he was.  As Dr. Who, he was all teeth and bulging eyeballs -- personified frenetic energy all wrapped neatly in a skinny suit containing a lean but egotistical ham.  Tennant's acting had been practically as tame as his gel-less hair when he first took the role as the Doctor, but his level of emoting increased the higher he spiked the cattywampus mop on his head.  I barely recognized the actor by the end of his tenure.

Masterpiece Mystery, I first thought, cast Tennant as the lead in ""The Escape Artist"" to exploit Tennant's enormous popularity after ""Dr. Who.""  I thought by the title the movie would be a comedy -- a genre I felt was the only genre that would be right up Tennant's alley.

I saw the movie first on television.  I didn't realize that the UK versions of films like ""The Escape Artist"" are heavily edited when they air in the US.  The Blu-ray disk contains the original UK version.  ""The Escape Artist"" was such a brilliant film and Tennant's acting was in itself a work of art, I just had to get the Blu-ray to see the film, uncut, as it was meant to be seen.  As great as I thought the US broadcast was, I did not expect to be completely and utterly blown away by the Blu-ray version.

5922971,3,B00EJFEN50,"David Tennant turns in a fine performance as Will Burton which is good because he's the main reason to keep watching this story of courtroom procedure, justice, and revenge. The show is stylish enough and has good moments. Also, several members of the cast pull off their roles quite well including Toby Kebbell as the menacing Liam Foyle.

The degree to which you enjoy this is largely the degree to which you can view the British Justice system as horribly broken and the minions of the law as hopelessly incompetent. The Crown manages to lose three murder cases through a sheer force of incompetence as they fail to check a computer history before going into court and accusing the defendant of being a consumer of revenge porn, failing to fill out the search warrant form properly, and failing to properly examine the body, all while running a crime lab that invites defense challenges. While Will Burton is supposed to be some sort of genius, we really don't see it until Part 3 as the Police and prosecutors manage to defeat themselves quite nicely.

The character of Maggie Gardener (Sophie Okonedo) is hard to even get a handle on. Her actions at the end of Episode 3 are inexplicable and more an indication of lazy writing than anything else.  Her defense in Foyle's second murder trial is understandable. Her actions at the end of Part 3 are not.

Overall, if you can enjoy the music and Tennant's performance and not focus on the plot holes, this is decent but certainly not great, British drama.",1413158400,2,1507,4.718631178707224

5922992,5,B00EJFEN50,"I knew that I was going to enjoy watching David Tennant in this, as I really like his work in previous movies and TV shows, both here and in England, but I was surprised at how this mini-series steadily drew me in!

The ending of the series was a real shocker and a fantastic twist of power.  The British judicial system was made to look quite foolish throughout, and it seems to me that this particular situation would probably not have happened here in the US, not that our judicial system is any better.......but with the plethora of guns available over here, I doubt that the stalker would have manipulated the system as easily, or survived any of his nasty exploits at all.

Quite an interesting slice of British life and well worth the time to watch!",1412812800,,756,4.5036496350364965

This perfect vehicle show Tennant's range as an very good maybe great, actor. I was absolutely mesmerized by his performance. It's  a story that has many stories within it.

5923075,1,B00EJFEN50,"This show doesn't know what it's about, and waves its hands at something horrible to hide that fact. Is this A) a show about a lawyer so good that he ignores his instincts? Is it B) a show about a broken justice system in which murderers get off? Or is it C) about the need for good people to keep on going, even when the worst things imaginable--and I mean worst--happen to them? Unfortunately, the show offers no answer--at least during episode one which was maybe the darkest hour of television I've seen in a while--but I suspect it thinks it's 'C', which I'm just tired of, as a dramatic move. Call it the 'superhero origin story-ification' of drama, in which we're not meant to care about a character unless they can work themselves back from the absolute pit of tragedy to take revenge on their enemies. Except that, hey, it can't be that much of a pit and there can't be actual grief because we don't want to bum our viewers out too much, so let's lean on the twists and turns of legal thriller genre conventions to make it enjoyable.

5923190,3,B00EJFEN50,"Warning: Spoilers!  The typical American TV procedural feels incredibly rushed.  Law & Order manages to stuff the crime, the investigation, and the trial into 43 minutes; NCIS can have a terrorist attack, kidnapping sub-plot, and apprehension in the same amount of time.  It's not a good thing.  But neither is taking 2 hours of material and stretching it out to 3 hours with: fights with the fancy dishwasher, many scenes of the baddie looking bad as he preens with his feathered friends, then unnecessarily menacing several minor characters, etc. etc.  There's a point when you've clearly gone beyond establishing a mood and are just trying to fill the admittedly awkward timeframe allowed by the network.  It's too long for film, but too short for a real mini-series.  Paradoxically, at times the storytelling is a bit too elliptical; as though this was a 3.5 or 4 hour work that was cut down to 2.5, then had .5 of filler added back in.  If there's the possibility of this being turned into a series, less time should have been spent mourning the ex-wife by watching old wedding videos and more on showcasing the rivalry between barristers.  And it's really not necessary to maintain an element of surprise in every single plot development...doing so just begins to be contrived.  For example: can't we have a 15 second explanation that they are going to Berwick and then Tennant is going onto Scotland alone, before it happens?  It undermined the final plot twist: if it had been more clear he was (publically) only going there to consider moving the family, the development of the last 25 minutes would have been more of a surprise.  As it was, one felt the writer must be ""up to something"" because there was no real sense of denouement after the second trial.  An ounce of conventional plotting would have been a pound of cure in this instance.
Still I was impressed certain aspects of the production, and will look forward to future offerings from David Wolstencroft. I have a feeling with a more experienced script editor this could have been excellent.",1409529600,2,2062,4.823863636363637

5923212,4,B00EJFEN50,"The Escape Artist is an interesting study of the Justice system, especially in regards to a defense lawyer's duty to do their very best to get their client released even if they feel that the client is probably guilty. The main character, played by David Tenant of Doctor Who fame, is a defense mastermind who never looses. When faced with a self- proclaimed despicable client, he uses his skill to get the client off with devastating consequences.

There are, of course, several holes in the plauseability of the plot, but the overall story is intreging and masterfully told.

5923243,5,B00EJFEN50,"The Escape Artist was very good.  I must admit, I had difficulty understanding what the main character, played by David Tennant, was saying at times, in the same way that I had trouble with the speed of Benedict Cumberbatch's delivery of his lines, in the new Sherlock Holmes series.  I do not usually have trouble understanding most British films or TV shows, but these two actors deliver the lines so quickly, its difficult for my small brain to keep up.  That was soon solved by turning on Closed Caption.  Once I got into the flow of their respective deliveries, I found I didn't need the cc as much.  Anyway, enough about me...let's talk about my opinion:  The series was very well written and acted.  There were twists and unexpected turns that kept my attention, along with the great storyline.  David Tennant was a bit spooky at times, with his intense look and I wondered if he could have played the part of the bad guy, just as well.  If you enjoy murder/revenge-style mysteries, you will really enjoy this, which is, at times, a very intense thriller.  Warning:  There may be some language issues, if you watch on Amazon Prime, where it seems those things are in original form; and there is some blood, including close ups of the photos of the victim.  There are only 3 episodes of season one--we used to call these mini-series, but now, it appears the BBC and PBS are just calling them TV series.  Excellent, nonetheless!",1409097600,,1433,4.661354581673307

While it kept me entertained and suspended, there was an alarming amount of plot holes and illogical plot developments. *******SPOILERS******** I still don't understand the motive for the second murder even though you could see it coming a mile away. And though I am unfamiliar with British law, I would like to believe that if you see someone outside your cottage in the middle of nowhere presenting a possible threat to you - enough that you call the police - wouldn't you provide a description and perhaps even a sketch? And why would you even go back to the cottage virtually alone in the middle of the night?

I kept expecting her to actually do something. Also, for a scumbag criminal defense lawyer, Tenant's character, family, friends, etc., were incredibly likeable people--that simply rang too false.

David Tennent, as always does a brillant job, this time as a barrister who has a 100% win rate, defending some of Britians most dispicable.  Does guilt or innocence matter in our ""justice system"";And when the gander discover that the goose is in terrible trouble and suffering, does the former make concessions?

In the States, topics such as pornography, murder, and sexuality may be considered more mature than for ""parental guidance suggested"" audiences. What I found exceeded and broke all my expectations. What they've packed into this first hour is incredibly complex, gruesome, and vicious. Quickly, this episode turns into a proper thriller -- gritty with superb acting.

I am concerned over many modern pieces where the arch of the character or the story ends ""badly"" without repentance, resolution, or moral understanding.

There was enough of my usual taste there that the shocks to my sensibilities were not enough to turn me away. I watched this all the way through, and though it's not my usual fare, I'd judge that it was first-rate.

This show started out a little slow and almost seemed as though it was going to be the uneventful life of an brilliant attorney. It primarily focuses on a single case that has David's character Will Burton defending an intelligent killer. It isn't until their lives start to intertwine that it becomes interesting. By the second and third episode it seems this show is a winner. The twist of fate and the struggle for Will to avoid disaster is emotional. David Tennant does a great job, as does Toby Kebbell who plays the defendant. I'd give it 4.5 stars since it's a slow start, but being Amazon's rating system isn't granular enough for half stars I round up on this one.",1407715200,,816,4.557823129251701

5923452,5,B00EJFEN50,"Actor David Tennant does an excellent job as a UK barrister who is renowned for getting off criminals, especially murderers. Here he has an especially unsavory murder client whom we know is guilty. He again triumphs by getting him acquitted but he shows his disdain for his client by refusing to shake his hand as they part. His client is not about to let this snub go and shortly begins stalking the barrister and his family. This becomes a harrowing cat and mouse game as to which of the two men will triumph in this battle. How far this powder keg of a barrister-client relationship might go is the issue. UK crime shows are invariably excellent and this is one of the UK's very best with an outstanding actor at the helm. What is especially clever is that this is perhaps the most complained of matter in criminal law: lawyers who get criminals off. So to see the tables turned is a guilty pleasure many murder trial watchers will enjoy.

It is tense and fast paced with brilliant acting by it's lead, David Tennant of Doctor Who fame. I'm not a Dr. Who fan, but I have found everything else he's done in British television brilliant. He plays a criminal defense attorney in a legal system that is much like our own. We wonder how these attorneys can represent clients who outwardly seem so guilty. It turns out that this barrister has to believe deeply in his client's innocence, that's how it works for him. But what happens when a client admits his guilt after being found not guilty? A lot happens, I won't spoil any surprises. Sophie Okenedo gives a wonderful performance as his protege who ends up opposing him in court when her own moral compass goes awry.

5923504,4,B00EJFEN50,"Clever series plots with fascinating question about how far would a ""decent"" person go to avenge a terrible wrong when the legal system fails him. Are we all capable of ""cruel actions"" toward another as suggested early in the first show by the ""I am not a nice man"" defendant when he tells his first barrister that the latter is just like him? One issue that is left open in the series that can have a real impact on your opinion about the alleged serial killer is that it is not clear that he actually committed the first brutal murder of which he was accused. He himself denied doing it and the audience does not observe any independent evidence of its own to confirm that he did it. There certainly is no question that he is a very creepy person, but that does not mean he was a murderer. Indeed, the audience's certainty about his having committed the wife's murder is primarily based upon apparently seeing him at the scene. But was what we saw not an independent observation but merely reliance on what the barrister says he saw, in which case if the barrister was wrong in his view, we are also wrong. Once again, the Defendant never admitted to committing that crime. Finally, it is not even clear that the barrister actually committed murder either in that the scenes we are relying on for a definitive answer are scenes reflecting what the female barrister surmised happened, and without the actual body to reexamine, there is no way to confirm her theory. Furthermore, why should we believe that the original autopsy and its review by the Scottish barrister didn't adequately consider that possibility. If her theory was correct it also indicates a glaring risk that the defendant barrister took in committing the murder as alleged since the public recording and a ""proper"" autopsy review would have probably cooked his goose. And, once again, the defendant barrister never admitted his guilt. The bottom line is that the only things the audience actully independently sees through it own eyes involving the Defendant is when he is following the barrister's son (no harm done) and when he observed the wife while she was bathing (no harm done). I will grant that there is some additional basis against the defendant barrister being a murderer based on the independent evidence showing his contacts with his prior client and his possession of the knife. Of course, if one were to assume that the creepy defendant had not murdered anyone and the barrister had murdered him in a very painful matter, then who is the monster?
From a technical point of view, I agree with another reviewer that some of the transitions in this three part series are clumsy or not properly explained.",1407283200,,2687,4.755888650963597

5923545,4,B00EJFEN50,"The performances are excellent, especially that of the wonderful David Tennant as the beleaguered barrister, Will Burton, and Toby Kebbell as the psychopathic killer, Liam Foyle. From my point of view, however, the story stretches credulity. When Will's wife, Kate, is surprised by a peeping Tom while  in taking a bath at their cottage, she tries repeatedly to call her husband, who left his phone in the men's room. She calls the police only when he finally phones her back and tells her to do so. Unbelievable!  Why don't these people have window coverings, especially in a bathroom? I also cannot buy that a woman would return to the cottage, in the dark, accompanied only by her child after her frightening experience on the previous visit.

Though Sophie Okenado is a fine actor, I was not able to fully grasp her character, Maggie, Will's rival. I think the fault lies with the script rather than her performance. I am eager to see the second half of the PBS version tonight on my local station in a delayed showing to check out Maggie's role as mentioned by another reviewer. This program is still better than 95% of what is shown on TV, so I gave it 4 stars.",1407024000,,1167,4.628019323671498

It took a while to get comfortable with his Scottish accent, but the plot was excellent and gripping. Escape Artists features a lot of elements that really heightened the drama -- a hero who calculates everything in his head so you don't know what he's going to do, a lovely family, with a nice kid, a formidable opponent and a terrible, scary villain.

This is a crime drama with a focus on the psychology, intellect and motivations of the characters without focusing on the gore and sensationalism of the crime. I am glad to see this is Season 1, so there is hope for a continuing David Tennant starring story line.",1406764800,,573,4.415094339622642

Sure I'm watching re-runs of Doctor Who, no worries. BUT, sometimes you need to explore and see what else is out there. So I did, and I wasn't at all disappointed when I found this little beauty. David Tennant's part as lawyer Will Burton is now my second favorite in his list of rolls. I got the first episode for free on Amazon, and let me tell you that they certainly know what they are doing when they give you a free episode. The first part of the series left you in shambles. To the point where you are obnoxiously calling up local libraries and movie rental stores frantically searching for the rest of the series with no avail. You then come to the deciding factor, in where, you are pondering whether you should order the DVD and wait a week for the shipping, or buy it on Amazon's Instant Video. I made my choice in buying it instantly, because it was that addicting.
So watch it, cos it's David Tennant.",1406678400,,945,4.314606741573034

The acting was very good (it is strange to hear David Tennant speaking a different, perhaps native accent). The story contains some very violent and distrubing elements in the court room scenes. Sophie Okonedo was brilliant as the prosecutor turned defense attorney. It was very well written and did not succumb to the cliches that one might have expected.

While all thriller/mystery/cat and mouse shows have a bit of predictability, there were parts that I truly didn't see coming.  Let's face it...the Brits have the Americans beat when it comes to television.  They produce Downton Abbey and The Escape Artist while we produce the likes of Honey Boo Boo (the epitome of all that is wrong with Americans including a general lack of respect, obesity, bad manners, etc., etc., etc.) and other such reality disasters.  It's embarrassing.  British television allows the imagination work its wonder and focus on the story at hand instead of pointless graphic showings.

5923679,4,B00EJFEN50,"Very well done. Of course, parts of it were distressing - as one expects with a criminal law story. David Tennant did a fine job as part of a very strong ensemble and the story is engrossing.

There were a couple of moments when I got a hint of Dr. Who, but overall I think Tennant managed to create a three-dimensional, sympathetic and believable character as Will Burton, barrister. His legal rival (Sophie Okonedo) did an excellent job of portraying a fiercely assertive legal mind tempered with well-hidden and controlled private misgivings. I always find the contrast between American and British law to be fascinating; it was doubly fascinating to get a peek into the differences between British and Scottish law.

The scenery in Scotland was gorgeous. The child actor was appealing without being too precious. The actor portraying the villain (Toby Kebbell) is gifted in making himself thoroughly appalling while not indulging in the ticks and tells that some actors use to telegraph to the audience ""I am bad"" when portraying human evil. He has a way of smiling with dead eyes that instantly triggers one's deepest fears - appearing almost innocent and wholly vile all at the same time.

On a technical note: the articulation was acceptable for an American viewer with middle-aged hearing - I did turn on the closed captions but only rarely needed them.",1406332800,18,1361,4.934497816593886

5923716,4,B00EJFEN50,"A brilliant thriller with great writing and even better acting.  David Tennant shines in this film as Will Burton a brilliant criminal barrister (laywer for us Americans) running the gambit of emotions and taking the viewer along for the ride.  The supporting actors were just as great with Sophie Okonedo as Maggie, Will's opposite, who is driven to beet Will at any cost.  Then their is Toby Kebbell  who gives a chilling portrayal of Liam Foyle the murderer in this piece.  Their are many twists and turns in this film that makes you give thought to what is the Law and what is Justice and what is Moral.  Knowing someone is guilty and proving it are two different things. It also makes you think what you would do in the same situation.

  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because this is not the PBS/Masterpiece version but the BBC DVD version.  The two were cut a little different, in the PBS/Masterpiece version they cut small scenes that did not advance the story line but added scenes that in my mind were very important to the story line and made it make more sense .  For instance the relationship between Maggie an the DNA Lab Doctor that Maggie uses to find out about the extra cleaning of the lab and then uses so skillfully in court.  This also goes a long way to explain that Maggie would do anything to beet Will  weather it is wreck a relationship or go all the way to Scotland  to go against him.  Also an extra scene between Will and his wife and a scene where Will is watching Maggie on TV talking about home invasion and you see his frustration is rising.  Not that their is anything wrong with the BBC cut version, I have the DVD and love it but I just thought the version I saw on TV on my PBS station was better and was hoping this was it, which is why I purchased this too.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves British Drama, brilliant acting and great writing.  Also I would recommend this to anyone who is a David Tennant fan, this is one of his best.  The last 10 min. of episode 3 is worth purchasing and watching the entire series for.",1404864000,83,2073,4.323834196891192

5923718,4,B00EJFEN50,As usual an excellent production from Masterpiece. Superb acting with a thriller storyline. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the credulity of the story. At times the actions of Will and other characters were not very believable. I also found the court scenes and outcomes somewhat unrealistic but perhaps that is due to the differences between the British and American justice systems. All in all a very entertaining and well done production.,1404777600,,449,5.0

The very fact that this is only Season One indicates that he's going to do it again (or may be) and get away with it again.

David Tennant was totally miscast as the lead, he is so great in comic roles, but this role was too serious for him,  There is NO humor in the story, which is fine, because it is a serious story, but most of the programs have at least some tongue in cheek humor, from Downton, to Selfridge to Endeavour.  They really tried, with a fine cast, which was wasted on a ridiculous story which made no sense, too many plot holes, too many situations that any reasonable person would have avoided.  Why would the wife ever have gone to the cottage knowing that there was a stranger lurking around??
I wanted to like this, and I never thought in a zillion years that I would ever be critical of BBC/PBS but this series was terrible.  Very disappointing.",1404172800,9,817,4.3841059602649

5923733,4,B00EJFEN50,"This is a typical British Crime Series, but with a very dark and disturbing twist. It portrays the justice system as a game of oneupmanship, rather than the pursuit of justice. We know that justice is not always forthcoming, but to reduce it to this level seems a little over the top. This is Luther without the grit, and that makes it seem more callous. Second, the motivations seem a little obscure. The rivalry between the barristers is a tad overblown, and that makes the female barrister seem a truffle petty, even though the actress is excellent. Indeed, all of the acting is excellent. My next point is that the failure to anticipate the client's motivations and next actions renders the main characters either stupid, naive or so self-important that they believe that they are somehow immune from the clutches of the wicked or the consequences of their own actions. I knew what was going to happen the moment that the lead protagonist failed to shake his client's hand. Why didn't he? Doesn't he watch the same shows that I do? Does he not know depravity when he looks it in the face? I should say, however, that having the protagonist committing the perfect crime is a nice touch.

Finally, why do the British make themselves seem so irrational.  They either tell each other nothing or fall all over themselves spilling their guts out. Their interactions seem uneven, especially children. While teenagers can be secretive, little children tend to be more forthcoming. The little girl in Case Histories is perfect.

All that being said, watch it.",1404086400,3,1554,4.834586466165414

5923739,4,B00EJFEN50,"Imagine being the top junior barrister (lawyer) in your field. You have never lost a case in defending your accused clients. You're adept at finding loopholes and strengthening the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" clause in the law. You always win and the defendant goes free, but what if the evidence is so strong that your client has committed murder?

Will Burton (David Tennant) faces this dilemma in the British mini-series THE ESCAPE ARTIST. Burton is happily married to a lovely woman and their family is completed with an adorable 8-year-old son. Burton is consumed with winning his cases but has time for his family. All is good until accused murderer Liam Foyle (Toby Kebbell). Burton's professional nemesis is prosecutor Maggie Gardner (Sophie Okonedo). Gardner and Burton clash in their opposite fight for  ""justice.""  Although Burton has inner doubts about Folye, his job is to clear his client's name and a potential serial killer goes free with tragic results for Burton.
Here is the gem of the story. What happens when a defense attorney strongly believes his client has committed a horrific crime? How does the legal system keep violent criminals off the street when technicalities can free a criminal?

THE ESCAPE ARTIST does seem to expose flaws in the British legal system as it raises questions of moral conflicts.
As Burton becomes a victim, we see his role and perception change as Gardner decides to switch from prosecutor to defense.

Unfortunately, THE ESCAPE ARTIST is a short mini-series with only three episodes. This moral dilemma faced by Burton could be expanded as he fights for his own justice. There is an interesting conflict between Burton and Gardner. Gardner seems hardened by being the number 2 barrister to Burton's number 1. Professional jealousy clouds her mind and she may the one to stop Burton in his quest for justice. All interesting story telling.

In a way, Burton and Gardner are both mirror images of each other while being dynamically opposites. Both live in modern glass houses. Yes, the bottom floor walls are all glass with no curtains. No room for privacy and maybe this touches on the theme of voyeurism in the story.

David Tenant, Sophie Okonedo,  Toby Kebbell, and a wonderful array of British character actors make THE ESCAPE ARTIST a fine drama. It's a disappointment that the series is only 3 episodes. A few more episodes could have strengthened the story and its impact. As with most BBC crime/detective stories, THE ESCAPE ARTIST is well-written and stylishly filmed.",1403740800,14,2529,5.01909307875895
5923740,3,B00EJFEN50,"""The Escape Artist"" is a case study in taking outstanding actors and having them act out a script that is beneath their talents. It's not a bad show, by any stretch, but it started to feel like one of those American law shows that start off with beautiful actors, lots of hype, a pretentious plot, and endless shows that quickly devolve into repetition. Granted there was no repetition in ""The Escape Artist,"" it didn't have the feel of the Masterpiece stamp.

David Tennent and Sophie Okonedo are fantastic in their roles. I must admit that Tennant seemed mildly detached in parts for a man who had lost his wife. Okonedo played an over-ambitious barrister to a tee. Toby Kebbell definitely shines as a psychopath who comes across more psychologically dangerous than physically. And given such great talent in the aforementioned actors, the third installment (e.g., the part starting from Okonedo's character finding the ""gift"" in her flat) came across rushed and given Tennent the star, it fell into the realm of formulaic.

It will be interesting to see where the series goes in the future. I'd like to see Tennent and Okonedo's roles fleshed out to either cooperate or be adversarial to lend credence to ""helping"" their clients. The talents are there to carry the story. Now the plot needs less formula.",1403740800,9,1307,4.882882882882883

5923745,5,B00EJFEN50,"In this stylish British legal thriller, a brilliant barrister Will Burton (David Tennant) grapples with the question should he defend a man Liam Foyle (Toby Kebbell) whom he suspects is guilty of a heinous crime?  He doesn't know for sure the man is guilty, and he doesn't appear to want to know.  Burton takes the lofty position it's just a case, and everyone deserves a defense.  He's just doing his job, and he never loses a case.

When the case starts to hit closer to home, however, it's harder to be philosophical.  Suddenly, perspective changes.  What if you win the case and the man strikes again?  How do you protect your family and others?

This is a taut legal thriller with accomplished actors and textured British scenery (England and Scotland) as a dazzling backdrop.  The legal strategy fascinates as the case becomes more complex.  Written by the show MI-5's David Wolstenscraft, the dialogue is fresh and smart.  Burton's legal colleague (Anton Lesser) , legal rival (Sophie Okonedo) and son (Gus Barry) enrich the show with particularly talented performances.  All of the supporting performances are excellent and seem realistic.  David Tennant, as the gifted lawyer, carries the show with his finely acted portrayal.  If you saw Tennant in BROADCHURCH, he plays  a different kind of character as the confident and warm Burton, you question whether it's the same actor.  I thought maybe it was the actor's brother - he's that versatile in playing a role.

There's a bit of gruesomeness in the first episode, but it evolves into more of a suspenseful legal thriller.  There's a few predictable plot twists, and ""too stupid to live"" moves, but then it veers off into something more original and complex. This film allows the viewer to look at the law through many lenses of the participants: the lawyers, the victims, the witnesses, the judge, and the criminal mind.

5923747,5,B00EJFEN50,"""The Escape Artist,"" written and produced by David Wolstencroft and directed by Brian Welsh, is another outstanding thriller from the PBS ""Masterpiece Mystery"" series. The story focuses on Will Burton (David Tennant), a brilliant but cocky London barrister who has never lost a case, even when his clients were obviously guilty. ""Everyone deserves a defense,"" Burton says, though the limits of his philosophy are tested when he has to defend Liam Foyle (Toby Kebbell), a particularly disgusting and depraved rapist-murderer. Burton gets Foyle off too, but receives a massive dose of his own medicine in consequence of his refusal to shake Foyle's hand after their victory.

Some reviewers have revealed the plot here, but I will not, because you need to know as little about the plot twists and turns as possible going in. I will just say that the writing and direction are every bit as polished as we are accustomed to seeing from the BBC; that Tennant is wily and charismatic as Burton; that Toby Kebbell (who looks like a cross between Prince Andrew and Frankenstein's Monster) is a masterfully hateful Foyle; and Sophie Okonedo is simply smashing as a professional rival of Burton's. When it comes to murder mysteries and courtroom dramas, nobody does it better than the BBC, and ""The Escape Artist"" proves that point once again.",1403654400,2,1333,5.031674208144796

Also, of course, it involves one particular barrister who's choice of representing criminal defendants turns into a nightmare for him on a personal level. The shortcoming of the shows, for me, was that the legal reasons for this psycho's release from charges, were weak at best, especially the second time in court. As a former prosecutor myself, I can say there is no way charges would have been dismissed in the second case. But, for purposes of the story, the writers played fast and loose with the law.
