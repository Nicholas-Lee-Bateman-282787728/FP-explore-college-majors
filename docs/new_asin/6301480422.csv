330622,4,6301480422,"Holmes takes on the case of a young solicitor accused of arson and murder. He enters the case with his work cut out for him, as the circumstantial evidence against the young lawyer is very strong, and the motive an  excellent one. Holmes must prove his client innocent in the face of  mounting evidence as he matches wits with the stubborn and un-creative  Inspector Lestrade. In this installment of Holmes mysteries, the late,  lamented Jeremy Brett shows the melancholy side of Holmes as the case turns  against him. Colin Jeavons is excellent as Lestrade, but the character of  MacFarland seems much too unconcerned about his fate to be effective; a  little more emotion and indignation would have helped a considerable  amount. The unravelling of the mystery is both ingenious and funny, as  Holmes outwits Scotland Yard, saves his client, and comes face to face with  ""a very deep, vindictive, and malicious"" culprit. A worthy  effort.",957225600,4,940,5.0
330623,5,6301480422,"To me, it would seem like filming such an oft-read classic like this would be equal to trying to re-invent Santa Claus: How do you keep people from hating you?  But Grenada proves up to the task and the result is marvelous!  The atmosphere, terror, dark suspense and ultimate horror found in the  Conan Doyle story fill each and every frame of this loving adaptation.  The  cast has captured their characters with amazing clarity and Brett continues  to prove that he and only he was born to play Sherlock Holmes! I always  wondered exactly what it would have been like to watch Holmes deal with a  bent poker and this enactment satisfied and impressed me.  ""I really  have some scruples about bringing you along tonight, Watson..."" and  rightfully so.  Add this to your video collection!",939772800,8,788,4.7555555555555555
330624,5,6301480422,"If the American over-the-air tv networks spent more time studying work such as this and applying it, instead of grinding out prurient cookie-cutter garbage, they might not wind up losing 20% of their viewers  year after year!  In addition to the consistently grand elements Grenada  brings to this series, they have picked one of the two Conan Doyle stories  featuring Sherlock's older (and, even according to Holmes) smarter brother,  Mycroft.  Charles Gray turns in a virtuoso performance as Mycroft (you  might remember him as Blofeld in the James Bond film DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER  and as the narrator in THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW)and both Gray and  Brett are at the top of their form as brothers - including the outstanding  and humorous deductive ""duel"" against each other as they observe  the gentleman across the street.  The tale that follows is one of the  darker, more sinister efforts Doyle ever penned, and gets downright  disturbing as the Interpreter watches the bandaged captive being subjected  to an almost inquisition-like mental torture (and obvious physical torture  prior to his appearance).  To say that this episode shows ""Love can be  blind"" is an understatement, and the rollicking/terrifying finale  onboard the speeding train is wonderful, if startling.  Above all, it is  always a thrill to watch Jeremy Brett become (and I mean  ""become"") Sherlock Holmes. He should be awarded not only a  posthumous ""knighthood"" but be publicly proclaimed, by every  nation, as ""a world treasure"" for what he accomplished with this  role.",939600000,8,1553,5.190283400809717
330625,5,6301480422,"To be able to sustain the high level of quality and value that this Holmes series does, is a breath-taking accomplishment by itself.  And this episode is another drop in the bucket of examples, book-ended by Brett's truly  masterful portrayal of the legendary Holmes.  Colin Jeavons joins in with  his recurring characterization of Inspector Lestrade, self-important,  mousey and patronizingly  dismissive of his intellectual superior, Holmes.  As with Conan Doyle's short story, this is a maze of mystery and deceit.  But even Watson takes on an added allure as he suggests to Holmes a review  of bank papers, which Holmes hadn't even considered and the result drops  another conclusion into Sherlock's deductive reasoning.  Good old Watson!  (and a splendid job by Burke).  Brett shows us another glimpse into Holmes  benign contempt of the official police force with his rallying them into a  chorus of ""Fire!"" (""gentlemen, we can do better than  that"") and again the master dons a disguise that is unexpected and  fascinating (both for Sherlock and Jeremy Brett).  It is especially fun to  watch Brett's Holmes subtly shift his demeanor as he sees the light at the  end of the tunnel and knows he can throw it in the face of Lestrade.  Kudos  all the way around for this excellent episode . . . and a series so well  made that you will want to rush out and read the original stories!",939254400,4,1387,4.858369098712446

I loved the old Basil Rathbone stuff, until I saw this Jeremy Brett-acted series. I much prefer the better versions of Dr. John Watson which are portrayed with Jeremy Brett's Holmes. Watson as portrayed in the original stories was no dummy (as was the one shown by Nigel Bruce), and neither was the Watson as shown in the BBCTV series.

The main thing I didn't like about this was the sound-quality: well, it was a used tape, after all, and I should've expected it:). But, it wasn't as ""crisp"" as I'd've preferred since there were no captions included, and some of the ""muttered comments"" in these stories can be pretty necessary to the plot.

But in general it was plenty good enough that I enjoyed it, and understood the general story-line quite well.",1365552000,,991,4.922155688622754
7811849,4,6301480422,"Based on one of my favorite SH stories, and I am most happy it follows the story closely.  Well, almost.  Wasn't happy with the ending, which was different and not satisfying at all.",1363996800,,182,4.484848484848484
7811850,2,6301480422,"Greetings.  William Gillette, the legendary stage Holmes, is nowhere in evidence on this disc.  It's full of several of the Ronald Howard TV series.

7811851,3,6301480422,"Conan Doyle has let us down.  There's little deduction in this story.  Strangely, it's a tale of crime, not subtle at all.  However, the dramatization, acting, and ambiance are as usual outstanding.",1056758400,,198,5.125
7811852,5,6301480422,"Well, what can I say, besides typical English quality throughout, as usual! This episode, once again with the genius Jeremy Brett as Holmes (after him it must be an impossible task to play the role as Conan Doyle's detective for any actor), also introduces Sherlock Holmes brother Mycroft and has a thrilling story about a Greek man held prisoner and tortured in a house by a couple of sinister blokes who tries to persuade him to sign a paper. An innocent greek interpreter falls into danger as he gets involved against his will, and his situation becomes especially dangerous as he decides to reveal everything to Sherlock Holmes. The story, the acting, the directing and the Victorian atmosphere -- everything is splendidly made, and quite close to Conan Doyle's novel. The high tempo ending scene on a train is unforgettable.
Besides the title characters I will especially say hats off to George Costigan for his brilliant performance as the laughing villain, a man who comes close to the devil himself -- and plays him (with glasses and a splendid austrian accent) in a way that makes a chill run down your spine, as well as delivering somewhat of a comical satire on Peter Lorre. One of the best psycopaths I've ever seen on film! Don't miss it.
In addition I can only say: see all of Granada's Sherlock Holmes series! You won't be dissapointed.",1048809600,,1351,4.777777777777778

The great conversation leading up to Watson's ""we are only just in time to prevent some  subtle and horrible crime"" will send chills up your spine. One of the  best of this memorable series.",960595200,4,309,5.16
7811854,5,6301480422,"This is easily one of the better enteries in the Granada Sherlock Holmes series.  It boasts excellent acting, a horrid villian, and ample suspense.  This is generally faithful to the story and retains much of the dialogue,  including Holmes's initial confrontation with the sinister Doctor Grimesby  Roylott.  Other highlights include the opening scene, the stakeout on the  Roylott compound, and the shattering climax where Holmes and Watson  discover the secret of their client's woes and of the truth behind  ""the speckled band.""",959385600,4,532,5.402439024390244
