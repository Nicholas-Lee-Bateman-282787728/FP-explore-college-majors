8107481,3,B000E929L0,This was a helpful dvd but a bit clunky in it's presentation. The photographer repeats himself a lot. The setup of the lighting was helpful but I would have liked more help with classic Hollywood posing as well.,1307059200,,211,4.578947368421052
8107482,2,B000E929L0,"I really was expecting a photographer of serious experience with the Hollywood lighting style and was very disapointed in the content, presentation and knowledge of the photographer.  Although he is very amiable and seems to have a profitable local photography business, this is not a serious DVD on Hollywood lighting and is certainly not worth $50.",1294358400,2,350,5.25
8107483,5,B000E929L0,"I have been a wildlife phtographer for over 20 years and have always had a fascination with the old glamour hollywood lighting that created the studio portraits from decades ago.  Though I have great Nikon CLS speedlights that are versatile and can do amazing things, I was not able to re-create the subtle highlights and diversity in the types of shadows that made those old portraits so timeless.  I was not willing to invest a large amount of money in a studio strobe set and purchased this dvd because it focused on constant tungsten lighting (much more inexpensive than the studio strobes) with a concentration on that classic lighting I wanted to emulate.  I had purchased several other books and dvds addressing this subject but quite frankly they focused more on showcasing the author's portfolios without really showing you how the images were made.  General information was given but it was not specific enough to allow you to truly recreate the image or give you a real understanding of how the shadows or highlights were obtained.  Being a primarily outdoor wildlife photographer, I have never been extremely familiar with the use of studio strobes and always found using them a hit and miss challenge.  This dvd is simply stated in a very easy to understand manner.  It shows you the advantage of using constant lighting to ""paint"" your portraits which allows you to see the shadows and highlights before you take the image.  More importantly, it shows you how to control that lighting in the most subtle ways that can make a huge difference in your final product.  The author does not try to sell you expensive gear or insist on one manufacturer or another but gives you several options aimed at saving you money while still getting good results.  The proof is the fact that I was finally able to obtain the results I had been searching for by following the guidance provided on this dvd and I couldn't believe how relatively simple it was with equipment that cost me a fraction of what other instructional programs had recommended.",1291334400,,2046,4.82
8107484,5,B000E929L0,"This is an excellent training video for 'Hollywood Style' lighting. The photographer is an excellent teacher and keeps it simple.
I've been a photographer for a zillion years and was familiar with most everything he taught. In my regular photo work I have never used continuous lighting and that is where I found this video to be the most helpful. The look you get from studio strobes and from continuous tungsten or halogen lights is completely different.
If you are just getting started with photography you might be a bit lost. Get to know your camera,metering and practicing with one light on a patient friend before you start with a production of working with more lights to 'paint' your subject.",1288137600,,701,4.85
8107485,3,B000E929L0,"While the lighting might be Hollywood style, the photos not so much. There is a section where he shows his portfolio allegedly created with similar setup as shown, but none of those pics behind the scenes are shown. He also uses hot lights, and setups are indoors. I like the section where he starts with a dark room, and goes on showing the effect of each light. Overall satisfying but I was expecting more.",1255996800,2,408,4.527027027027027
8107486,5,B000E929L0,excellent and unique lighting lessons.  nothing else like this.  very easy to do with inexpensive lighting equipment.  gives you a look that rocks.,1231891200,,147,5.304347826086956
