3594865,5,B001G1MBXQ,"Was surprised to see that there was a Slapshot 3 when I saw this at Walmart, I liked the original, the 2nd one was so so,but this one actually turned out to be a pretty good movie and I would most certainly recommend it- especially if you like hockey.",1261785600,,251,4.142857142857143
3594866,4,B001G1MBXQ,Great hockey movie. More mature than the Ducks- Movies and had a nice story to tell by using the fastest game on earth to tell it.  And this one didn't have a Baldwin in it. Just love the final episode of the Slap shot movies,1243641600,,225,4.0
3594867,4,B001G1MBXQ,"The 2nd one was awful so I imagined this would be far worse. I could not resist picking it up seeing Leslie Neilson on the dvd cover. Unfortunetaly he was not his usual goofy self.
But to my surprise it was very good and the Hanson Brothers made me laugh again. The romance was very cute. A few cameos were a little cheesy but they aren't actors anyway.  Overall, I thought it was very good and similar to the Mighty Ducks movie.",1231545600,,429,4.2317073170731705
3594868,4,B001G1MBXQ,"A funny movie..... MUCH funnier than #2. Also several great tributes to the original film. First the boys are from the ""Newman"" Home for Boys. Second there is the locker room speach that Player/Coach Dunlap gave in the first is brought back here. ""Get that stick in his side and let 'em know you're there!!""
The Hansons are back!! And God help us, so are their sons. This time they get to be the Hansons. Not like the second movie where there was very little of our great heros. Throw in some camios from a couple of greats, and you have SLAP SHOT 3.
I enjoyed it. You will also.",1231200000,,579,4.2727272727272725
3594869,3,B001G1MBXQ,"I won't as dour a rating as the previous reviewer, but I won't give it a good one either. A Slap Shot followup rated 'PG'? Come on, you can do better than that!

On the other hand, there were several ""repeat gags"" that were apparantly tributes to the original in a setting that is a little more presentable for kids.

Being a former hockey player myself I can attest that minor league hockey life was very much what the original Slap Shot portrayed, and that's not something I'd expose young kids to; Slap Shot 3 is for the parents who grew up with the original and want to give their kids something in the spirit of the original and don't want to have to stoop to giving their kids 'Mighty Ducks' films (don't get me wrong, this film is only a notch or two above 'Ducks' films, but undoubtably better).",1230854400,,803,4.346666666666667
3594870,1,B001G1MBXQ,"lf you thought Slap Shot 2 was a slap in the face of this celluloid legend, then Slap Shot 3 will make you feel shame for more than 2 minutes.

The Charlestown Chiefs now sponsor a kiddie league and our three favorite hockey goons are now the coaches of these pubescent Hanson Brother wannabees.  The Hanson Bros. try their best to teach kids about hockey and about life.  Their abilities are tested when one two of the kids on the team are caught putting on the foils...on their things and have an impromptu sword fight in tale of curiosity.

Well, the bad boy of the team, sort of like a little 0gie 0gglethorpe catches them and ridicules them.  He is soon traded and blabs about what he saw to the rest of the league as kids would do, thus making the Lil' Chiefs the laughing stock of the league.

Well despite the humiliation, the Hansons try to comfort the kids that it's ok to ''explore'' and that what they did was not wrong.  But you know with kids, in one orafice and out the other.

Normally this would divide the team, instead it brings them closer together.  The Lil' Chiefs start winning games and go through the playoffs until guess who they have to play in the finals?  You got it.  Lil' 0gie.  They proceed to hit the Chiefs with elbows and insults.  Finally in sudden death overtime, our two little musketeers set up the winning goal, thus good triumphing over evil.

This film is nothing to shake a stick at...or a ''sword'' for that matter.",1228780800,2,1459,4.43609022556391

3594873,3,B001G1MBXQ,"Slap Shot was an iconic, raunchy sports comedy up there with Major League, Caddyshack, and (the original) The Longest Yard. Slap Shot 2 was a weak attempt to do it again, without the humor and sharp edges.  Slap Shot 3 was neither.  Instead it was The  The Mighty Ducks meet the Hanson Brothers.  Sweet (in a very predictable way) and mildly amusing.  Given the raunch of the original, it's surprising to say the kids will love it.  For adults, if you're like you just wanted to see the 3rd in the franchise, otherwise go back and watch the 1st one.",1402358400,3,549,4.44
3594874,3,B001G1MBXQ,"This movie, I also, did not know existed until 2 weeks ago. This one is actually better than Slap Shot 2. Which is weird to say. This one has zilch to do with the original, other than alluding to the original team and name. One of the best parts of the movie is having 2 ex-NHL players in it. Mark Messier may have a really small part, but if you watch the kid clutching his arm in the announcers booth and the see the look on his face it is priceless and worth the $3.75 I paid for this one. The goalie on the opposing team called the Ice Hounds, you know is going to get his spoiled ass kicked and sure enough he does and that is satisfying in itself. Whoever is behind the mask is actually a very talented goalie, and the kid playing the part does a good job of being a total creep who lacks any humbleness of a real hockey player. Oh and the Hanson brothers are back and this time they each have a kid whom they have taught their ways. They do a pretty good job of being bruisers like their dads were. The Ice Hounds, also, recruit players that belong being locked up, just like the original movie and that is about it for resembling a Slap Shot movie. If you can get this for what I paid or less and have 90 minutes to kill this one okay and better than Slap Shot 2. That said nothing is better than the original, of course.",1400457600,2,1329,4.057034220532319

3594880,1,B001G1MBXQ,"What a waste of money. Even my 11 year old hockey player hated it. The story line is really bad and the acting is worse. I thought it would be a fun, cleaned-up version of Slap Shot, since we won't let him watch that yet, but at least on par with Slap Shot. It should be called ""Slap Me Silly if I Buy This.""",1326412800,3,308,3.828125
