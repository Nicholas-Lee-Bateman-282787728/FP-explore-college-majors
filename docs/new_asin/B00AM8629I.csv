5450431,5,B00AM8629I,"Loved the album, and the Blu-Ray was just as was a lot of fun!!!  One tip, DTS is not set to the standard audio, you have to select it with your remote or in the audio options menu.",1385510400,,181,3.763157894736842
5450432,1,B00AM8629I,Was expecting waaay better. Boring. Lackluster and amateurish. Sorry because I am a big Sully and Godsmack fan. Next time.....,1382400000,,126,5.35
5450433,5,B00AM8629I,"This concert is fantastic.  The songs sound identical to the CD.  The sound and picture quality of the Blu-ray is superb.  I wish a CD of this concert was sold, as it would probably never leave my CD player.  This is a must have for all Sully fans.  You will not be disappointed.",1378684800,2,279,4.188679245283019

5450436,5,B00AM8629I,"Silky, warm.....
Like a crackling fire burning in the fireplace on a crisp autumn's evening...
Or the mist that rises from the mountain tops in the early morning hours...
Breath taking",1369353600,,184,4.967741935483871
5450437,5,B00AM8629I,"This is perhaps one of the best concerts I have ever seen and I have seen plenty. I do like the band Godsmack, but this album called Avalon is far more exciting and just beautiful to listen to. It showcases Sully Erna at his very best. Along with a cast of other brilliant musicians. It shows that Erna can really sing, as well as play a host of differert instruments. I really hope he does another album with this line up.",1366934400,4,423,4.234567901234568
5450438,5,B00AM8629I,its the best music out there.  Its like the acoustic godsmack album only better.  Its like celtic music on an intense badass power trip.  its a must have for anyone that enjoys any kind of music.,1365724800,,195,4.361111111111111
5450439,5,B00AM8629I,Sully is a true perfectionist as all talented musicians are. The only flaw in the Blu-Ray I purchased is in the editing where the F-Bombs and other explicates are beeped out. Other than that it is a masterpiece. 10 out of 10,1365638400,2,224,4.357142857142857

5450442,5,B00AM8629I,"Truly awesome DVD. This is the kind of music that might result if Heart and Jethro Tull got married and moved to Ireland, and then their village was overrun by Norse raiders in flying saucers. Am I saying 'Avalon' is the war-child of rock-and-roll Druids and Space Vikings? Yes. Yes, I am.

I've never been a Godsmack fan, and I probably never will be, but I felt obliged to give them a listen after discovering this project on PALLADIA. 'Avalon' offers a richness, lushness, and complexity unlike anything Sully Erna's 'other' band has produced. Here, he has assembled a top-flight group of musicians to produce a sound unlike anything I've heard before--arguably a new genre. When I listen to this music, I feel like I'm hearing the soundtrack for an epic saga I'd dearly love to read.

I'm a guy who always prefers the clarity and production value of the studio recording to the clutter and Russian Roulette acoustics of live concert music. In this case, the CD is undoubtedly excellent--but the live DVD is transcendent. Its superiority seems partly a case of 'practice makes perfect,' ironing out missteps through repeated performance; almost without exception, each new phrasing, vocal or instrumental, represents an improvement over the studio version. Mostly, though, I think it has to do with having the entire ensemble performing together. The best example may be cellist Irina Chirkova, who is featured on the CD for one song, 'Until Then.' As part of the band, playing on nearly every song, she adds a layer of complexity one misses from the studio versions only in retrospect. The percussion is also enhanced by strength in numbers; the earthy, skin-on-skins feel clearly benefits from having all hands on deck, creating a dramatic, tribal sound.

The other advantage of the DVD is of course the visual aspect, and no performer benefits more than the fantastic Lisa Guyer. The sound mixing for her spectacular, soaring vocals seems better here than on the CD, as does her comfort with the material. Her phrasing, emphasis and intonation are even sharper and more precise, approaching perfection by the time this live show was recorded. While there is no costuming aspect for the band in general, Guyer best represents the atmosphere of 'Avalon:' she, like Chirkova, performs barefoot, adding to the primitive, rustic tone. Dressed and bangled in a quasi-Romani fashion, she whirls, undulates, twirls and gyrates on her portion of the stage like the high priestess of some angry mountain god.

I could go on at length about the superb musicians on display here, none of whom I'd heard of before, but suffice it to say there literally isn't a wrong note to be found. I can watch this concert for hours, and listen to the CD for days before I feel the need to switch to something else. I cannot recommend it any more highly; it is truly unparalleled.",1417651200,5,2860,4.902892561983471
