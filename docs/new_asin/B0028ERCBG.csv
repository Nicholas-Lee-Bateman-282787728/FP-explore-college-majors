8356105,2,B0028ERCBG,"The company that issued this DVD has done an admirable job of making some classic NASCAR races available in their entirety, and any student of NASCAR's history should seek out these DVD's.  But there is one major problem with this DVD of the 1976 Daytona 500.  A significant portion of the race has been lost and therefore is not included here.  It clearly states at the beginning of the disc that much of the middle of the race is missing. Unfortunately, though, there is no indication on the outer package, or on this webpage, that the race is incomplete. The famous finish is included, and I won't spoil the ending for anyone unfamiliar with this historic race.",1258934400,2,664,4.6581196581196584
