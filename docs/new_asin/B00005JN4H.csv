1518767,4,B00005JN4H,"Taxi looks as though it would be a rediculous movie, and guess what, it is.  It's just so rediculous that it's funny!  The premise is completely absurd and that's what makes Taxi successful in being a validly funny comedy.  This movie doesn't try to be anything it's not. The premise of the movie is about an underdog cop who has issues with driving teaming up with a newly appointed taxi driver who isn't your run of the mill taxi driver.  Together they have to solve a big bank robbing case and redeem their reputations. Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah are both great in thier roles.  There are some pretty sweet car scenes in the movie also, I can't believe how decent they made a Crown Vic look.  If you're looking for a fun movie thats sure to provide some laughs than Taxi is for you.",1097712000,3,789,4.406896551724138
1518768,4,B00005JN4H,"I went in to Taxi not expecting too much. I figured it would be one of those buddy/cop comedies that rehash everything that's been done in every other movie in the genre and all the good parts were in the commercial. But, Rush Hour 2 and Starsky And Hutch (both buddy cop comedies) were good, and I had low expectations for those too. So into the theatre I went. Boy was I wrong about Taxi.

Although my assumptions proved to be right for the first 15 minutes, the last hour and 25 minutes proved me wrong. Latifah (who I always enjoy) and Jimmy Fallon (who i've hardly heard of) had wonderful chemistry and sparked this fun ride of a movie. Also, with the beautiful bank robbers and the stunning Jennifer Esposito, and not to mention Christian Kane in a miniscule role, made this movie amazing. After the first 15 minutes of Falloon being an idiot ended, this was a pleasurable movie that had an amazing selection of both action and gut bursting comedy. If you want to have a wonderful time tonight, see this movie. You won't be dissapointed.",1097280000,2,1043,4.518518518518518
1518769,4,B00005JN4H,"We thought this movie was great.  Really enjoyed both Fallon and Gueen Lativah.  Much better than the reviews.  Also, the soundtrack is great.",1097280000,,142,5.086956521739131
1518770,4,B00005JN4H,"Jimmy Fallon is a cop who is such a bad driver he loses his license. Queen Latifah is a cab driver with a souped up Taxi who is a great driver. When Fallon comandeers Latifah's cab to stop a bank robbery,  vehicular mayhem and fun break out! Add to the mix the fact the bank robbers are Brazillian Super Models and you have a surreal good time for all!

  Ignore the critics who have cut this movie to shreds. Its pure escapist fun that rates four stars. Enjoy!",1097280000,13,461,4.204545454545454

1518878,3,B00005JN4H,"I like Jimmy Fallon & Queen Latifah but this was a hard one to really love.
Queen Latifah plays pretty much the same way in every film I've seen her in, I mean, she's likable & fun and this role is no stretch for her.
Actually, she really seems to be the best actor in this movie :P
Jimmy Fallon's late night show is alot of fun, but he can't carry a move, at least not this one. He seems to be stuck here in the longest skit ever.
Sadly, though both He & Queen Latifah, though they sing well in real life, they are screeching out songs here, which wasn't  funny for the viewer though it probably was for them while making it. Alot of Dumb, childish, Saturday night gags, all strung together.
The car chases are alot of fun, though newer movies offer better ones.
would have rated it lower, but it's hard not to like Queen Latifah , she glows, shimmer & smiles that infectious smile, kinda winking at the camera cause she's getting paid to have fun.",1499212800,,949,4.2430939226519335

He's adorable puppy in this film. Looking at him on late night and you have to conclude, damn, that boy has some serious city years on him. One decade, 40 years of living.

Queen Latifah is fabulous as expected. Her man toy is . . . hot. Enough said. The rest of the cast = delightful. QL and JF + Giselle+ make for a cute action flick. Nothing profound, but good to watch once or play in the background as regular rotation. Level of hotness for supporting cast is frankly through the charts.

1519514,5,B00005JN4H,I am rating the extended version. This is a very entertaining film. Latifah and Fallon make a funny comic team. The film is fast paced and filled with  jokes. This is the most romantic film that Latifah has ever made. She is seen kissing and hugging her boyfriend throughout the film and you wonder why all movies featuring couples don't do the same. I really felt the attraction between Latifah and her boyfriend. This is a remake of a French film that has four parts. Highly recommended for fans of action comedies. A must see for Latifah fans.,1427068800,,546,4.571428571428571

1519578,4,B00005JN4H,"This is a great little movie. Fallon is funny as usual and Queen Latifah is as well--unexpectedly so. Ann Margaret is hysterical. The three of them play off of each other so well. The Brazilian ladies are pretty but boring except for Gisele Bndchen whose eyes express what her English doesn't always. Jennifer Esposito is one hot tamale and her scene with Bundchen frisking her is too funny for words! The action here is non stop with the cars racing everywhere at once. I especially enjoyed the final car chase; the ending was totally unexpected but very satisfying!  This one will hold your attention, believe me!",1425686400,,615,4.80188679245283

If you like Fast&Furious, Smokey and the Bandit, or any car chase movie, this is one to certainly add to your collection!",1280016000,,269,4.74468085106383
1520131,3,B00005JN4H,"""Taxi"" is a ridiculous movie based on a series of ridiculous French films by Luc ""Transporter"" Besson.  I don't know what aspect of the story is the most bizarre: that the New York banks are being robbed by Portuguese bikini models, Queen Latifah having bike skills that'll pounce Mat Hoffman, a taxicab that acts like a transformer, or Jimmy Fallon as a cop?  My money's on Jimmy Fallon.  In fact, if there's one thing that would ruin an otherwise run-of-the-mill popcorn flick, it would be that guy.  His attempt at comedy is about as effective at tickling my funny bone as a sledgehammer, and it's just as painful.  His character does nothing but cause problems instead of solving them: he can't drive a car, he charges into enemy headquarters, and he patronizing with armed criminals.  He's an insignificant nuisance, and even if he does grow out of these problems with the help of a Natalie Cole song, he's still a humorless character with no trace of charm; I sorta wished Jennifer Esposito's character (wearing a low-cut top for a lieutenant) would just fire him at his first offense.

Why couldn't this movie be all about Queen Latifah?  Her wisecracks need to be diminished, but she's more than capable in getting the job done on her own.  She knows where she had to go, she has her people to scout the area, she understands the mind of a criminal, and she drives like Nascar; that woman's a better cop that Fallon is, and she's just a cabbie.  I know this set-up of the incompetant/competent pair is deliberate, but all this incompetent fellow did was look at a map.  If the movie has to be another ebony-and-ivory buddy cop flick, why couldn't she team up with Mel Gibson?  He may be controversial in recent times, but I can trust that psycho over this comedian.

As far as ""Taxi"" goes, the sensual nature of the villains and the cast made it too silly, and too much of its humor is about two leads arguing; they're not funny, and they go on like clockwork.  But the car chases were entertaining, even if they are absurdly planned.  But as absurd as the movie is, it's a fun distraction of an absurdity, same as ""Hudson Hawk"".",1279065600,2,2137,4.586842105263158
1520132,5,B00005JN4H,"Belle Williams is a speed demon. Flying through the streets of New York in her tricked-out taxi, she's earned a rep as New York's fastest cabbie. But driving a hack is only a pit stop for her real dream: Belle wants to be a race car champion. And she's well on her way, until she's derailed by overeager cop Andy Washburn, whose undercover skills are matched only by his total ineptitude behind the wheel. Washburn, whose lack of vehicular skills has landed him in the precinct doghouse, is hot on the heels of a gang of beautiful Brazilian bank robbers, led by Vanessa, their cold, calculating and leggy leader. To nab the evasive crooks, drivers license less Washburn convinces Belle to team up with him to pursue Vanessa and crew. Belle has carte blanche to drive at any speed and break any law.

Andy Washburn is a thoroughly inept police officer who's such a bad driver that his very own lieutenant takes his license away from him, leaving him without wheels to do his job in crime-ridden Manhattan.  Belle Williams is a newly licensed cabbie, whose absurdly hopped-up taxi Washburn jumps into when he needs to get to the scene of a bank robbery.  Together, they become an unlikely crime-fighting duo as they go after a quartet of gorgeous Brazilian criminals who look like they just stepped out of the pages of Vanity Fair or Vogue (quite possibly the least believable criminals in movie history).  And if this synopsis doesn't sound like the setup for a cinematic disaster to you, you obviously have a much lower threshold for movie comedy than I do.

Trapped in a vehicle that is practically a blueprint for how NOT to make an effective comedy, Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon have nothing to do for 97 minutes but exchange witless one liners in between highly preposterous and ultimately very boring car chases.  Although the two lead actors try their best with what they've been given, they're eventually overcome not only by bad writing and by-the-numbers direction but by a bunch of supporting actors who give uniformly dreadful performances (including a sadly misused Ann Margaret).

1520209,3,B00005JN4H,"This movie is another proof that a comedy does not have to be plausible or even have a good plot to make us laugh.  To keep this kind of silliness in the air the movie depends on the delight created by the stars.  Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon bring energy and fun to this lame brained comedy.  From the opening bicycle messenger sequence under the titles to the very last outtake there is nothing in this movie that makes much sense let alone a speck of plausibility.

Yet, you just like watching Queen Latifah occupying the screen.  Yes, we would like watching her all the more in a better movie, but sometimes it is OK to have fun being silly.  Her souped up taxi is silly, that she can zoom through downtown traffic is silly, that Fallon could be a cop with all his foibles is even sillier, and there is a lot more in this movie that is even dumber including the Super Villains being attracted to bank robbing.  Fallon is not as delightful as Queen Latifah, but makes his feckless cop into someone you almost care about.  He and Queen Latifah do have some chemistry as a comedy team.

But who cares?  This is not a movie about realism.  It is playing pretend and setting up silly situations that we can laugh at.  That Ann Margret as Fallon's constantly intoxicated mom can make drunkenness funny at all is an achievement in today's MADD world.

If you want to turn off your brain for a bit and understand that all your enjoyment will be destroyed the moment your plausibility circuitry evaluates anything you are seeing on the screen, this should work for you.

Taxi stars Queen Latifah and Jimmie Fallon. Latifah is a former bicycle messenger turned taxi hack, while Fallon is a New York City policeman who cannot drive. Fallon while reacting to a ""bank robbery in progress"" call employs Latifah to drive him the crime scene. Thus begins the arduous journey of our two co-stars.

As you can surmise, the robbers successfully escape; Fallon is relieved of duty; Latifah loses her cab, and both must rely on each other to catch the guys (or in this case, bad girls).

As in any buddy picture, the movie is only successful if the chemistry works between the stars. And though Fallon and Latifah aren't Gibson and Glover (Lethal Weapon), or even Chan and Tucker (Rush Hour), the camaraderie does work; and I did enjoy this film.

My rating: Wait for the Video

BTW... Obviously the cab sequence of changing from taxi to supped-up hotrod must have cost a great deal of money..... The sequence is shown three different times throughout the movie..... At some point you're sitting there saying to yourself, ""ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!! Get to the Chase!!!!!!!!""

1520257,1,B00005JN4H,"A genre bridging feature (comedy-action-sexploitation) where a hapless NYC cop teams with a fast-driving mouthy cabbie to chase four leggy foreign supermodels robbing banks. Very little of the comedy works, the action sequences would have been great in 1970 but the advent of digital effects takes most of the thrill out of this kind of stuff (if they are totally fake who cares), and the sexploitation is a teasing afterthought.

The failure to deliver on the sexploitation part is especially curious because it would have been the easiest of the three to get right.  They certainly promoted that angle but the models are only on the screen for about 4% of the running time and even then are mostly in nonflattering disquises (the second unit probably shot all their stuff in one weekend before INS deported them).  The brainlessness of the producers in this regard rivals Pamela Anderson's awful ""Barbwire"" where she was dressed in sexy black outfits only to be filmed entirely in shadows.  And they wonder why their films lose money.

""Taxi"" wastes no time losing its wheels, they fall off with the  opening scene of an ""svelt"" bike messenger (obviously not Latifah) racing through the city, finally stopping to remove his helmet to reveal Latifah herself. Insulting your intelligence at the beginning at least lowers your expectations for the rest of the film.

1520259,3,B00005JN4H,"You can't move for sequels, prequels, spin-offs and remakes (or re-imaginings) these days. Hollywood is suffering a real dry spell when it comes to new blood as most stuff we get now is from previously released material. Some remakes can be impressive (Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and others can be downright pointless (Alfie!). Taxi is an obscure choice.

The original French version was written by Luc Besson in 21 days out of pure boredom as he waited for Columbia to greenlight The Fifth Element. It was an okay, silly action movie that spawned 2 sequels itself. While it's a mildly popular film it's hardly the kind of thing that warrants an American remake. How many Americans (or anyone outside of France) cared for the original Taxi? As ramshackle as it is, Taxi NYC still seems to hold together thanks to the energetic performances of Queen Latifa and Jimmy Fallon. They do what the can with the limp material and are capable of duping you into believing that the movie is better than it really is. What's so bad about it? Well, the plot is non-existent and is really just a set-up for a couple of brief chase scenes featuring Latifa's suped-up Taxi. Director Tim Story tries to copy the easy-going pastel-colored design and liberated use of widescreen photography of the original as well as keeping the speed of the chases as fast as he can but the stuff in between is so dated and his direction feels like the kind of quality film-making you'd expect of Rush Hour 86. Plus, the sexuality of the original film has been erased. In France this would have been called harmless but in America they call it pornography.

It's hard to give this film a bad review as there is at least one good laugh per scene but the cheap, cruddiness of it prevents it from being anything more than a one-time only rental that won't really hold up upon repeat viewings. Trust me.

The DVD is in great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with good enough Dolby 5.1 sound. The sound design is hardly anything to write home about so don't expect to. The DVD I watched (Region 2-which has a much cooler box than that ugly-ass Region 1 cover) had an extended version of the film that ran 6 minutes longer.

Latifah plays Belle, an adrenalin addicted cab driver who's anxious to begin her career as a NYC cabbie in her souped up Ford Crown Victoria, yet despite her female macho outer shell, she's really a romantic softie at heart.  Her character, despite being larger then life (come on... how many overweight black females actually ride as a bike courier in NYC?) is also not the typical paper-thin, one dimensional empty shell that so many comedy roles are.  And her role perfectly complements the male lead.

Jimmy Fallon plays police detective Washburn, and he does such a fantastic job of playing a pathetic little dweeb of a cop that more then once I wanted Latifah to pound his skinny little a@@. The comedy kicks in when Washburn, who drives worse then a 90 year old grandma, looses his license and gets a demotion.  He manages to hook up with Belle and her crown vic, and together the two unwilling partners must team up to stop a band of bank robbers.

The movie starts off with some great bike riding, and we're not talking Jesse James bikes here, we're talking about a courier on a bicycle riding through the streets (and stores and subways) of New York City . This courier turns out to be Belle (Queen Latifah) who amazingly enough looked a lot thinner when doing all those bike stunts... anyway, Belle is finishing up her last day as a courier as she's starting a new career as a taxi driver.

Turns out Belle is a bit of a gearhead, and apparently an electronics wiz, design guru, bodywork genius and professional driver as well amazing that the only job she's held up to this point is as a courier. After strapping a supercharger to her taxi before turning in for the night, Belle is ready for her first day at work. The first passenger we see her take is a bossy white dude who wants to get from Time Square to the Airport in 15 min. No problem of course as this taxi would put KITT to shame. A panel pops up out of the console, bodywork changes before our eyes, the wheels change and she attaches a MOMO racing wheel to the steering column. Time to drive! OK, it's really silly but darn amusing to watch happen. Of course she makes it, scaring the crap out of her passenger in the process.

Next up is Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who is about to screw up a bust. Wait? Did I just spoil the movie for you? Could it be possible that the detective in the movie isn't a screwup at the beginning of the movie who will just happen to save the day by the end? Nah, you knew all that already, you're a guy. So Washburn screws things up and in the process has his drivers license taken away. The next time we see him he hears a radio call for officers to respond to a bank robbery. He's only a couple of blocks away, but doesn't have a car. He's young and appears in good shape, so of course he grabs a taxi for those two blocks. Yes, it's Belle.

From this point on Belle and Washburn are reluctant partners trying to solve a bank robbery. All typical buddy-cop stuff, but it's very well done. Why on earth did this one get 4 stars? Well, the car chases are very well done, the humor is consistent, and there's a priceless girl-girl moment that moved it from 3 to 4 stars.

The slick, transforming yellow taxicab takes center stage though and is more interesting than the movie. Can you actually get over 25 mph on the streets of New York?

Ann Margaret (Washburn's alcoholic mother) is true to form as her character. The love him or hate him NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon also makes a special cameo.",1109721600,,1035,4.965317919075145

1520310,3,B00005JN4H,"This was a one of those movies that seems to go off track here and there.  Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah fans will see the best and the worst of both stars.  What you won't see is any consistency in this film.

Taxi is a movie that seems to change directors from day-to-day filming; there are scenes that have all the excitement and star quality of a ""Lethal Weapon"", and there are scenes that have all the drabness of a daytime soap opera.

Jimmy Fallon plays a cop who is not a very good driver and has an ex-girlfriend (so he says) for a boss.  Their banter is not the least bit entertaining, even though I believe it is supposed to be.

Queen Latifah plays a bike courieor who finally gets her cabbie license.  QL is an excellent actress, and at times I almost felt like she was doing everything in her power to carry this film.  I think she is so appealing to the masses because she seems like such a ""down-to-earth"" person.  She has a real charm on the screen.

Fallon's character has some truly funny moments: The huge pile-up of cars when he tries do commandeer a citizen's vehicle and his alcoholic mother are amusing, but these good spots are rare.

The whole movie seemed to need a rewrite.  I didn't hate this movie, but I definitely didn't think it was all it could have been.  Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon are so talented that it takes an amazing script to utilize their talents.  I would advise them both to be more picky with their scripts.

So all and all...If there is nothing else to buy or rent, try this movie.  I wouldn't make it my first choice.

I did think this movie was very, very funny. There were some very surprising twists, and some scenes that were so ridiculously funny, they carried the movie.

The EXTENDED play version was a little boring, however... I normally love the ""director's cut"" versions of movies, as I'd rather see more - but in this case it created too much time between the really funny parts.

I really thought Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon were hysterically funny. My kids saw this 4 times in the theatre. I saw it once, then got the DVD as soon as it was available. I do recommend the shorter version if you have the option.",1108771200,,723,4.421052631578948
1520364,2,B00005JN4H,"I haven't seen the original French film this movie was based off of, but I can almost gaurantee that this American-ized remake had the French laughing their butts off all the way to the STOP button on their remote. This is a classic example of America taking something that isn't broken and trying to fix it.

Taxi is a rather formulaic comedy that includes car stunts, bikini wearing bank robbers, a supped up taxi, BMW's, little to almost no comedy and a storyline that allows for little progression or originality.

The biggest let down for Taxi was that nearly every single joke or humorous moment fell flat on its face. And the performances from Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon (sadly to say) were not all that great, probably due to the shallow and boring characters they were cast to play.

The only thing going for this movie was the cool car stunts and the angles they were shot at. And for me as a guy, the bank robbers were pretty good to look at too. Those were really the only things that kept this movie at being just a crappy movie and not a completely horrible movie.",1108771200,9,1082,4.482233502538071
1520365,1,B00005JN4H,"Dreams and aspirations often indicate what kind of profession a person intends to pursue.  In Taxi, which is a remake, the audience gets to follow two people with very different aspirations, one a cab driver and the other a police officer. Belle (Queen Latifah) has worked hard over the last five years, as a bike borne delivery woman, to accomplish her goal to become a cab driver.  The long and hard work has also affected Belle's relationship with her boyfriend, as she has been preoccupied with fulfilling her dream.  Her dream is to drive her own cab, a boosted Ford Crown Victoria on steroids in superior James Bond style.

Police detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) finds himself being demoted and having his driver's license suspended by his superior, Lieutenant Robbins (Jennifer Esposito), as a result of a car accident during a stake out.  Without a drivers license Washburn is forced to use public transportation, but when he overhears a bank robbery in progress over his portable radio he takes a cab to the crime scene.  This cab happens to be Belle's improved Crown Victoria, and it is about to put her career and relationship on the line while Washburn keeps digging himself a deeper hole.

Together Belle and Washburn begin a long uphill road in order to redeem themselves in regards to their professional careers and private lives.  This journey takes them through eye-boggling car chases, death defiant stunts, and a couple of lessons in how to drive a car.  These dangers are stitched together with slapstick humor and frequent situational jokes in regards to Washburn's stupidity, insecurities, and inabilities.  The humor and jokes are clichs from previous unoriginal films, which makes the jokes more mind numbing than humorous.  The timing of the jokes seems to be missed, as if the audience knows the punch line before the joke is presented.  This makes much of the humor silly, untimely, and overall less funny.

Taxi presents some high-speed car chases in New York, but many of them seem to go on forever as if New York City had mile blocks.  The bank robbers' ability to hit targets the size of a quarter in 100 feet distances while moving with a handgun presents a new level of sharp shooter.  These marksmen make Sergeant Riggs in Lethal Weapon look like a ten-year-old that still wets the bed.  Therefore, these scenes create much awkwardness and it appears that the car chases and the other action scenes were intended to induce some form of suspense, but fail drastically in doing so.

The combination of humor and action has been used efficiently before in films such as 48 Hrs. (1982), Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Die Hard (1988).  In Naked Gun (1988) the viewers could see parody in action, as it made a mockery of the films made before that brought the audience action, suspense, and comedy through the law enforcement.  Taxi attempts to deliver a film that walks on the ground in between the parodies and suspenseful actions, but never accomplishes to give suspense or comedy.  And as far as the message of following ones dreams and aspirations, well, it is lost somewhere in the beginning.  Overall Taxi offers a cinematic experience with very little true humor and suspense and would even make a nervous person fall asleep. Let us hope that Tim Story does a better job directing his upcoming Fantastic Four, as he did with Barbershop (2002).",1108598400,6,3403,4.873263888888889
1520366,3,B00005JN4H,I like the movie despite the fact that the plot is unrealistic. The movie is about a really good guy but a bad cop played by Jimmy Fallon who's after a bunch of super-model type crooks but is way out his league. That is until Belle who is played by Queen Latifah enters the picture. The ending was bad but wasn't good either. I don't know why Henry Simmons or Ann-Margaret was in the movie it didn't add or subtract in the movie.,1108598400,,429,4.180722891566265

1520369,2,B00005JN4H,"The 2004 US version 'Taxi' looks almost like a blurred copy of its original, 1998 French comedy of the same title.  The original became a hit series, spawning two sequels 'TAXI 2' and 'TAXI 3,' and this remake.  The difference is that the new story is set in New York City, and the taxi driver is played by Queen Latifah, Oscar-nominee of 'Chicago.'

French filmmaker Luc Besson (who directed 'The Fifth Element') produced both films (and wrote the original's script too), and let me be honest with you, his writing is far from an original or inspired one, but the original was an often funny buddy-buddy film with one fast MALE driver and one MALE bumbling cop.

For American version, which someone thought should be more ethnically-diversed, Latifah plays a NWC taxi driver Bell, into whose car a 'good-cop-but-worst-driver' Washburn (SNL's Jimmy Fallon) stumbles, in order to chase the four bank robbers.  Of course, as he is a bumbling cop, the results are just  disasterous ... a bad sign for the film itself.

Anyway they will team up to catch them, to redeem his pride and her car (and perhaps money), and we see in the next 90 minutes the bantering between Latifah and Fallon, plus some obligatory love interest from Jenniffer Esposito (as Fallon's boss and ex), and the guest appearance from Ann-Margret as Fallon's mom.

SO many formulas, you might say.  But the original WAS very formulaic, so anyway the director Tim Story ('Barbershop') has no chance from the beginning.  At least, the original (which I saw several times) had used them better way, letting the actors show their likable sides, making the pair very amusing.  Though the two leads in the US version are likable and affable enough here too, their characters look more forced and elaborated in New York City.  (Did you see a taxi running like racing car  there?)

The worst thing is, however, the portraits of the bank robbers, whose gun-holding Brazilian supermodel-like characters are way too ridiculous even in this escapist entertainment.  And know know, model-turned-actress Gisele Bunschen driving BMW?  Like 100 mph?  Even more embarrassing is a 'body-search' scene between Esposito and Bunchen, which looks like a footage from pay-per-view TV.

Not everything is bad, I say.  Car stunts are good though some might think the original did it better.  Still, considering the more crowded urban streets, the stunts are as good as the ones in the French one.  And the end credits which feature the outtakes are very funny, which means that you have to wait for them to see the funniest part, though.

Looking at these recycled materials, I cannot help feeling that if someone is holding back the US release of the original (even on DVDs), he does it intentionally to have us see this inferior one.  Wait for the release of the French version -- hope they will someday -- which is far better, I can assure you.

And M. Besson, please let no more remakes happen.  Did you really give OK to remake your noir masterpiece 'La Femme Nikita' which became ... er ... a weak copycat 'Point of No Return'?",1105142400,4,3074,4.820610687022901

1520414,3,B00005JN4H,"""Taxi"" is the kind of movie that you feel was made in a day. It is definetly one hundred percent entertaining, but it isn't good. It has some funny moments, but that's about it. I liked Jimmy Fallon, though. If he doesn't pick such idiotic things to be in, he could be a pretty good actor. He could follow in the footsteps of Will Farrell, the man who has eleven movies on the slate to be made in the next two years. Queen Latifah had two hits, and now she's killing her career in such bad roles. ""Bringing Down the House"" and ""Chicago"" were both great movies, but now she's bringing HERSELF down to ""Taxi,"" and ""The Cookout"" which I also give three stars. The number one problem with this is that it never knew which direction it was going. It tried to cram every single cliche into it's nintety seven minute running time, including bloopers at the end to make it seem that the cast had such a great time shooting this movie. It had alot of pointless scenes, including the last scene at a NASCAR race, which Jimmy Fallon and anthor cast member Jennifer Esposito are dressed as Lord knows what because they are undercover. She is another actress that has high potential, but chooses movies that could bring her down, like ""The Master of Diguise."" The special effects really aren't that great either, and it's obvious that the car crashes have been faked. Finally, I cannot stand the opening scene. There is somebody on a motorcycle, driving around town, jumping on trains, over a bridge, and finally she rips off her helment and its. . . Queen Latifah. It obviously wasn't her on the motorcycle, but we've seen that a million times, so it's nothing new. Just another cliche.

Jimmy Fallon stars as Officer Andy Washburn. He gets into a little trouble, since he is not so good at driving. He crashes into someone's fruit stand while undercover, and wrecks a few cars at the same time. His boss Marta, who also used to be his girlfriend, demotes him to a regular cop, but when he hears of a bank robbery on the radio, he decides he must take action, considering he is only a few blocks away. He tries to get a car, but gets into more trouble, so he gets into a taxicab, run by Belle. She could get anywhere fast, and now she has this custom made cab, built for speed. They see the robbers, three Brazilian bank robbers who dress as men to rob banks. Of course, Belle can speak their language, because it was part of one of her jobs a long time ago. The police take Belle's cab as evidence, and now Washburn offers a deal with her. He will get her cab back, if she helps him foil the bank robbers, and get back into the clear at the office. She agrees.

""Taxi"" is based on, I think, three French movies of the same name. Now, all you have heard from this is that I hated the movie, and yet I gave it three stars. That is, because it's entertaining. I had fun watching this, even though I've seen the same things over and over again. I laughed a few times, but it only merits a fair rating. Tim Story directed it, and he directed the fair ""Barbershop,"" but he missed out on the great ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business."" I'm starting to think that maybe I don't like this guy as a director, and he should move onto better material. My advice: wait for the video and hope they don't make ""Taxi 2.""
