6637496,5,B00NB9Y0US,"These look absolutely beautiful, and they are not the cut versions that aired on PBS.
Here are the run times from the time codes on the Discs.

series 1
1:28:10 = A Study In Pink
1:29:00 = The Blind Banker
1:29:30 = The Great Game
series 2
1:29:40 = A Scandal In Belgravia
1:28:25 = The Hounds of Baskerville
1:28:30 = The Reichenbach Fall
series 3
1:30:10 = The Empty Hearse
1:29:50 = The Sign Of Three
1:33:00 = His Last Vow

I did notice a slight authoring error on my Blu-ray of Series 2 Disc 2: The menu starts to load up, then goes blank and the FBI logo comes on.

PBS only cut the first season (in my area), series 2 & 3 were aired in 2-hour time slots with bonus material filling out the time.
Sadly Series 4 will be airing on the BBC America cable network instead of PBS. BBC America will air them in a 2-hour time block and try to keep them uncut, but they will be interrupted with commercial breaks!",1415577600,19,911,4.135593220338983
6637497,5,B00NB9Y0US,"Excellent collection, Busts are solid and heavy.",1415577600,,48,6.0
6637498,5,B00NB9Y0US,"You likely know about Sherlock already, so there's little point of reviewing it here. This set contains the first three seasons of Sherlock on both DVD and Blu-Ray, along with a bonus disc of special features (mainly specific to Season 3), which is also offered on both DVD and Blu-Ray.

Each season comes packaged in a 4-disc case, containing two Blu-Ray discs and two DVDs each. The cases are thicker than the individual release to house all four discs securely, and the cover art has been altered with a ""Blu-Ray + DVD"" banner added to the front.

Seasons 1 and 2 are identical to the their original video releases. All three episodes and all the bonus features are included. Season 3 is not the same as both discs have been reauthored to include new content: the Season 3 prequel is now on disc 1 and the first and last episodes have audio commentaries added to them. Again, all content is the same on both DVD and Blu-Ray.

The bonus disc includes a gag reel, a deleted scene from ""His Last Vow,"" interviews with cast and crew, and specials aired with Season 3 in the US.

Adding to the set is a pair of art cards depicting Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Watson. Also, some very nice busts are added, and will look handsome on a shelf (propping up these seasons?) or mantle, or, if you're not into such things, can be sold on eBay or gifted separately.

Opening the top of the box, the art cards and discs (in standard cases) are in a thin section at the back, and the busts take up most of the box at the front. After lifting out the cheap plastic casing and cutting the tape, these nicely-sculpted 3D depictions of Holmes and Watson are free to do as you please with them.

Overall, I was expecting a little less from this set, but was actually quite surprised. They offered good value with the discs, and the busts are great little pieces. If you were holding out on getting Sherlock, strike now!",1415577600,89,1926,4.472934472934473
6637499,5,B00NB9Y0US,So much fun. Love the additional special features and the mini busts.,1415404800,,69,4.833333333333333
6637500,5,B00NB9Y0US,"I pre-ordered this not long ago, here on Amazon. I originally had planned to purchase this limited edition box set from the BBC website, but even the pre-order option for them was $50 more expensive than the one here on Amazon, which I got for $136!

Anyways, the package arrived today and I am just amazed.
The box was very carefully packed and padded to prevent damage, even being inside of a bigger box for further protection, and when I finally got to the product I was astounded.

The box itself is gorgeous, with the Sherlock and John silhouette cut windows looking inside.

The busts are amazing and sturdy with really well done details and features. I have them up on display already.
The art cards are beautiful as well, and come together in a nice envelope. Amazing work!

As for the Bluray/DVD cases, they are all very nice with the discs stored neatly inside. Let's not forget the bonus discs either, including deleted scenes, bloopers, and much more behind the scenes that no one has ever seen.

I'm 1000% impressed, and totally feel it was worth the money.
I would definitely recommend it to any Sherlock fan.",1415232000,37,1123,4.651515151515151

6637503,5,B00NB9Y0US,I am very excited for this! They have never had a Bluray/Dvd combo pack for the season before. And just buying the Blurays would bring you up to $90 already.

6637531,5,B00NB9Y0US,"Thrilled to have received this as a Christmas gift. There are lots of comments in other reviews here about region/ disc play problems, which caused some initial concern for me. However, I am in the US and all three seasons play perfectly on my PS3, which is my default blu ray player. As for the other contents, the packaging is solid, and the statues feel quite heavy for their size. They are also well detailed (Sherlock's scarf is blue, which looks great against the faux bronze). The cards are nicely done as well.",1451001600,,518,4.580645161290323
6637532,5,B00NB9Y0US,There were a few reviews that said that seasons 1 and 2 does not play. I played them both in my PS4 just fine and I live in the U.S. So I'm not sure why theirs didn't play. Just wanted to pass that along to anyone who is hesitant to buy because of those reviews. I bought this for my husband and it's the perfect Christmas present :),1450224000,2,333,3.911764705882353

6637541,5,B00NB9Y0US,"My wife is nuts about this series. We have all of the DVDs on a per-season basis. There is a little bit more new material on the Blue-Ray (probably the DVD also but we just have not accessed those). The Blu-Ray quality is very good. The printed material is disappointing, The busts are really quite nice if you're into that. If you have the series already, this is way over priced. But this made my wife very happy, so I'm happy.",1437782400,3,429,4.308641975308642
6637542,5,B00NB9Y0US,"Wow, how fantastic is this?? I hadn't seen this series before, and took a leap of faith. I was amply rewarded. For full disclosure, I have a region-free BlueRay player, so I can't speak for compatibility (the BlueRay CDs worked great in mine). But the series itself is the BBC at its very best. I'd been a little wary of the actor's looks initially, as they didn't fit my image of the characters. Happily, both had my mental image changed by the time I'd finished with the first episode: Both Cumberbatch and Freeman are superlative in this, and they have a massive amount of on-screen chemistry.

The extras are good; the statues surprised me. I'm not normally a fan of el-cheapo stuff like this. These don't feel cheap. I used to work in a place that made plastic sculpture, and I know these are good-quality for plastic. No giveaway holes under the noses or anything (this is impressive). Really, and they have some great but subtle painting on them to give them an added touch of class. I thought I'd wind up giving them away before I got the set, but instead they are holding my DVDs in full view.

You get DVDs as well as CDs for everything, so if the BlueRay doesn't work you can try the DVD. I enjoyed the DVD extras, though the commentaries sometimes had too many people on them and it got a touch hard to hear everything. That's a minor quibble, though. Generally, the commentaries were informative and very good. (Occasionally, the interviews and specials felt repetitive after listening to the commentary, but it was never overbearing.)

If you haven't seen these, I recommend them, and if you know your Sherlock Holmes, you'll find all sorts of fun Easter Eggs from the original books (""Rache"" for example, which gets a cool twist). These are modernized stories that nevertheless play out from, and are inspired by, the originals.",1436745600,3,1843,4.682098765432099

As an added bonus, I was able to give the DVDs to a friend for Christmas, so I got my money's worth out of this set. As far as the actual series goes, it's an interesting and very different approach to the classic A.C. Doyle books. It's a modern take, set in current-day London, and it takes some getting used to. But it's a brilliant series, well worth the long runtimes.",1419638400,3,505,4.163265306122449

The statues that come with the set are high quality and really nice detailed. They seem like those alone would be a $100 worth. Additionally, I enjoy all the extras. As a fan of the show, I will say that this is one of the greatest shows ever made. The acting and the high quality production values, set this show apart from others. Even the typography used is amazing, very well thought and nicely placed. This is definitely worth the purchase.",1418774400,2,584,4.625

6637581,4,B00NB9Y0US,The busts and art prints are nice and all but I'm not sure that those warrant the box set costing so much. I wish they'd included more than one deleted scene. I imagine there's more in a show like this. The new commentaries offer fresh insight.,1418342400,,244,4.326086956521739

6637585,5,B00NB9Y0US,Fortunately this was one of the items that Amazon did a superb job of packing. Too often they carelessly throw an item in a box and totally destroy both the eye appeal and the collectible value of your purchase.  Sherlock LTD Gift set was packed solid but my Walking Dead Omnibus vol 5 came with no packing just tossed into a box and has bashed corners. I wish Amazon would get their act together. Right now it's always hit or miss with the packing. The busts were better than I expected. Quite nice actually. THis is for the hard core Sherlock fan so if you don't want the busts it's a bit pricey for the few extras.,1417305600,,617,4.273504273504273
6637586,5,B00NB9Y0US,"So I had preordered this, and finally got the time to watch it on DVD, since I had previously had to download the episodes, so this is nice. Packaging is great,and done with care to prevent damage. And the busts are considerably more weighty than I had expected them to be which was very nice. Only complaint I have is a minor one, in that it is the disc art. On all of the blu-ray discs as well as the Season 2 DVDs, the pictures are very nice and crisp. But for Seasons 1, 3, and the bonus discs, they're not. Its like they were printed on a home printer or something and are kind of grainy/overexposed or something. Not quite sure how to describe it, but it is slightly disappointing that the pictures don't look as good as the blu-ray versions.",1417305600,2,748,4.274647887323944
6637587,5,B00NB9Y0US,"I already had the individual sets for the 3 series, so this seemed like an indulgent purchase. But (after passing along my sets to a friend, relieving my guilt), this set is a delight to have. Some of the outtakes and the deleted scene on the bonus disc have been posted by others online, but the interview and extensive specials on the show included are must sees for fans. Having the BluRay and DVD versions of the show is a nice perk. If you don't already have the discs for the 3 seasons, this is the way to get them. And if, like me, you do... Find a disc-less friend to adopt the yours and indulge yourself with this set if budget permits!",1417305600,2,645,4.252032520325203
6637588,5,B00NB9Y0US,Wonderful in every way! I use the busts to bookend my collection of Sherlock DVDs.,1417219200,,82,4.533333333333333
6637589,5,B00NB9Y0US,"The whole set is gorgeous. Truly a delight for any true-blue BBC Sherlock fan. The busts look good and are a nice weight. The art cards are a bit smaller and not as thick as I expected, but they're lovely -- and of course, the DVD and Blu-ray discs come in beautiful cases. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. Thank you Sherlock producers and BBC for putting together this gift set -- and thank you Amazon for the timely delivery!

Additional details (11/28/2014) -- Just thought I'd mention this for the benefit of those ordering from other countries. Amazon claims that the discs on this set play for ""all regions."" Only the Blu-ray discs are region-free, the DVDs are not. I'm from Asia and according to my laptop, the DVDs are Region 1 discs. Fortunately, I was still able to change the region settings on my computer (I think you can only change regions up to four times or something).",1416787200,21,898,4.577639751552795

8677134,5,B00NB9Y0US,"The production is excellent. It has so much more depth than on television. I especially liked the behind the scenes information and interviews. One thing I didn't think I would like were the two figurines of Sherlock and Watson, love them. There likeness is so detailed and perfect on a mantle near the media center. I enjoyed the personalities and casualness of all the people in the series.",1521763200,,392,4.779411764705882
