6822060,1,B00PUUTS12,"Is this a comedy, drama, dramedy or just horrible?
Unfortunately, it is the latter.  This must have been produced for $200, although IMDB said the budget was $7 million.  It has infantile scripting, amateurish acting and VHS production quality. The effects are laughable.  However, the mini-sub is a cool design.  I don't know how Eric Roberts was seduced into appearing in this total loser.  Don't waste your time or money.",1433721600,,424,5.0
6822061,4,B00PUUTS12,"A good story.  Eric Roberts is not a great actor in my opinion, but he, along with most of the other actors, do a decent job with an excellent story... I'm stretching it to give it 4 stars, but I liked the story.  It held my interest.",1428710400,,234,3.9574468085106385

6822084,3,B00PUUTS12,"As one commentator stated, I am stretching to give this a 3. It was like being recorded by a video recorder or with too much animation of the planes and submarines. Eric Roberts is either desperate for money or bore looking for something to do. And the Russian accents were horrible. Spoofy",1461196800,2,290,4.596153846153846

6822086,2,B00PUUTS12,I never got to see it because the quality of playback was terrible. I don't know what is going on with Amazon but only about one our of three videos I download are clear to see. The rest of the other vary in quality.  Amazon is a great company perhaps it is caused from a poor download program. I say this because Netflix works great. What videos I have downloaded from Amazon either worked great of were terrible. It is a crap shoot.,1457740800,,434,4.228915662650603

6822089,2,B00PUUTS12,"Very disappointed. I watched this movie because I am a HUGE fan of Eric Roberts, so can I say, the fact that he didn't appear in the movie until close to the end (1st appearance 59:17), really sucked.",1455408000,,200,4.2894736842105265

6822109,2,B00PUUTS12,"Of course this is a bad film.  The acting (from the bulk of the cast...especially the ones speaking with Russian accents) is amateurish (although the two leads are fine), the VFX are cheesy as hell and the  plot is wildly implausible.  The best thing I can say about this film is this: it was NOT as bad as I expected it to be.  After sitting through the slow moving story for 45 minutes, I found myself WANTING to see how it all ended.  It's not the worst undersea thriller ever made, but for the record...yeah...it's not good.  Still...I did sit through the whole thing.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.",1439510400,,611,4.45045045045045

8689353,1,B00PUUTS12,"Well, It only took 6 minutes to verify this as absolute crap. Reminds me of the afternoon sci fi programs I watched as a kid in the mid sixties (they were great when I was ten). For the record, subs can't run diesels at 400 meters depth (diesels require being surfaced, as they use air). Then the graphics for the opening credits are what? Someone spilled the milk in zero gravity? Cut to the first scene, with the president. Reminded me of Leslie Nielsen in Airplane (Surely you can't be serious). Except Leslie was hilarious.
We can only hope everyone involved in this ""film"" lost money on it.

8689356,2,B00PUUTS12,"I must admit wholeheartedly that this is one of the worst films I've watched on Amazon Prime Video. Why? First, I only recognized one of the leading cast members in this film. Second, I found the premise of a ""rogue strike"" to be rather vague and not developed enough. Third, I thought all of the acting was rather cheesy and forced. On the other hand, I did find something of worth in this indie film. It had some amazing life lessons within for all of us to learn from such as not compromising the values we hold dear in life. This is definitely not the first film you would select to watch from Amazon Prime Video's collection, but if you run out of things to watch give this one a shot.",1494547200,,690,4.2748091603053435
