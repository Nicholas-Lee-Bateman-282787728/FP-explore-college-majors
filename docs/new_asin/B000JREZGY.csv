workout! I own quite a few of his dvds.",1396310400,,143,3.6451612903225805
8152684,4,B000JREZGY,"... if you've done Tony's workouts but it is a nice one to add-in if you are getting tired of a particular P90X workout. I like the Power 90 Master Series because they are always upbeat and they tend to clock in a few minutes shorter than the X workouts. So if you have a day when you are pressed for time you can mix this (or Intervals, or UML) in and still get your work in for the day.",1370995200,2,388,3.8625
8152685,3,B000JREZGY,"I have the p90X series and wanted something different, I was getting bored.  This is a really huge step down from P90X workouts, but it's good to do on your 6th day of working out or when you are really sore or tired.",1318464000,3,217,4.046511627906977
8152686,5,B000JREZGY,"I'm very happy with this workout.  I was extremely out of shape when I started and even the basic 1-2 workouts wiped me out.  Within a week or 2, I was ok, and progressed to the advanced workout at about week 4-5.  The time commitment, about 40 minutes 6x/week was very reasonable, and Tony keeps you going even when you're having an off day and just not quite as good as you were the day before.  I'm considering the p90x now, but happy with the ""masters series p90"" workouts in the interim.",1286755200,4,492,4.315217391304348
