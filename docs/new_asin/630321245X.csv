Paul Newman is electric as Fast Eddie Felson hustler  extroirdinaire. Jackie Gleason plays the fictional Minnesota Fats. Yes  fictional if you truly know your pool history. Fast Eddie travels from town  to town hustling enough money on his way to Ames, Iowa to play the  legendary Fatman. On his way Eddie learns about life,love and the evil that  the pool world of the era has in store. A must watch. If you keep your eyes  open you will see the one and only Willie Mosconi who worked behind the  scenes(and also played a small role in the movie) as technical advisor.

595145,4,630321245X,"Until I purchased this on bluray, it had been decades since I had seen this movie. My recollection of it was a bit rose-tinted I'm afraid.

This is clearly a work formed from the vision of one person, Rossen, the producer/writer/director. When one person has the much control, you get the good and the bad that comes with it. The movie is outstanding in many regards. Gleason's and Laurie's performances were flawless. Newman's was very good, but at times, it was a bit too easy to see that he was ""acting"". The cinematography, sound, musical score were all excellent. The technical aspects of the pool being played, and the culture surrounding it, were mostly spot on.

Unfortunately, if this is supposed to be a story of redemption, it really fails. Spoilers ahead...

The problem is that Newman's character, Fast Eddie Felson, was pretty much unlikable and hard to relate to from beginning to end. It was not for lack of skill that he lost to Fats ( Gleason ) at the beginning of the film, but because of a lack of discipline and character. The viewer is supposed to accept that Felson traveled the country, and by shear force of his natural talent, never encountered another player who could really challenge him  his skill or his character. This notion is frankly preposterous. No one, no matter how much skill they had, could play at that level without hard work and self-discipline. Between the first and final games, Felson made mistakes and learned from them, but his character didn't really change. Nor did he devote any significant effort to improving as a player. The whole ""broken people in a relationship"" trope with Piper Laurie's character often felt like it would be better in a different movie with a different author. ( A movie I personally would probably not want to see )

I do recommend this movie, but due to its writing, it's not one of the classic, flawless movies that deserves to be placed on a pedestal.",1506297600,,1931,4.718100890207715

Two men stop at a tavern and play pool for money. Another man is lured into the game and loses a lot. Can one man win ten grand tonight? Eddie Felson plays straight pool and wants to play Minnesota Fats. They begin their game. Eddie wants to play for $1,000 a game. Hours pass, it is morning. Eddie won over $11,000 so far. Im the best there is. They played for 25 hours straight. Now they're ahead by $18,000. Can they continue? Eddie won't stop, he loses again. The game is over, Minnesota Fats walks out. Late Eddie waits at the bus station and orders black coffee. He talks to a young woman. Later he meets her in a bar, they talk to pass the time. Eddie plays pool again and wins. He meets Sarah again. They converse.

Eddies friend Charlie meets him, he wants to return to their past business. But Eddie stays with Sarah. Eddie goes to a tavern and joins a card game; he loses. Then he finds a game. He wins but is beaten afterwards. A broken thumb stops his playing. Is Eddie a winner or a loser? Eddie recovered and looks for a job playing pool for Burt. They travel to Louisville by train. The Kentucky Derby attracts a lot of people. Eddie meets an acquaintance. A man invites them to his mansion; there is a crowd there. Eddie plays and loses. They must leave. Later the police are there because of Sarahs action. Back home Eddie meets Minnesota Fats and wants to play for $3,000 a game. Eddie wins, Minnesota Fats quits. Burt wants his share, or else. Eddie objects. Burt warns him against ever going to a big town pool hall again.

This is a dreary story about a hustler, a professional pool player who wins by playing less skilled players. Its value is in showing a part of life that most people know little about, and life around 1960. It is a warning about poor choices in life.",1505692800,,1818,4.341176470588235

595267,4,630321245X,"Review of The Hustler
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

If Paul Newman wasn't already a star, The Hustler would have made him one overnight. Fast Eddie is a Paul Newman trademark role: smart, quick, sexy, and just as likable as he is bad. Newman has played this character many times, and it never gets old. This time around, he plays a pool hustler who gets himself into trouble by challenging a well-known pool master when hes still small-time.

Even if you don't know the rules of pool, The Hustler will hold your hand and explain the rules to you so you don't feel lost by the time the major game sequences start. If you already know and love the game, youll find yourself in heaven while watching this movie. Its a total classic, full of drama, tension, and a steamy romance thats easy to root for. Paul Newman gives an excellent performance, showing vulnerability in the highs and lows of performance gambling. Its worth it just to watch him, but chances are youll probably come away liking the entire movie, too!",1499644800,,1015,4.571428571428571
595268,5,630321245X,"Poignant character study of losers and winners- and those who profit from both. Young Newman at his best, up against 'the great one' Gleason who was born for this role.",1499558400,,168,4.633333333333334
595269,4,630321245X,"A classic, but Piper Laurie's performance has not aged well, and there is too much of the Fast Eddie/Crippled Piper subplot. When she gives Eddie the people wear masks speech, the movie nearly goes off the rails. The melodrama of her suicide and resulting confrontation between Newman and George C. Scott isn't quite enough to sink a flawed but enjoyable film. Jackie Gleason is the standout.",1499299200,,392,4.954545454545454

595273,5,630321245X,"The Hustler is a lot more than a movie about a game called pool.  It's a film about life that uses pool as a back drop to teach the lessons expertly captured within the story.  Many people aren't aware that Robert Rossen's father was caught up in the ""Red Scare"" in the fifties and black balled.  Mr. Rossen uses the idea of corruption of power by Bert Gordon as allegory to McCarthyism.  This film is deep on a variety of levels if the viewer cares to look beneath the surface of stellar performances by Newman, Gleason and Laurie to reveal the true ugliness of human potential gone wrong for the love of money and absolute control, net, domination of the spirit as Mr. Gordon so successfully demonstrates.  As Ms. Packard labels Bert a Roman, she is led to the slaughter, sacrifices herself so that Eddie can transcend his nature and become the real winner in life.  This powerful film also features some great pool by Willie Mosconi, one of the greatest of all time and was actually shot in a real pool hall in NYC.

Additionally, this provides a chance to see iconic actors earlier in their careers.  The movie involves high stakes gambling.  This is a world that I barely know exists.  It is a trip into that world that I would othetwise never see.  I love Jackie Gleason as ""Minnesota Fats"".  Paul Newman is ""Fast Eddy"".

The movie is in black and white.  As with many other black and white movies there is a lot of use of lighting and shadows that is not to own art form, distinct from color.  As a student of black and white I try looking at the scenes from the standpoint of light and shadow.  It can be quite dramatic.  I love that part of these movies.

Upon watching it from a more mature point of view, I realized that this story was actually a ""character study"" of ""Fast Eddie"" Felson.  Also, I came to fully appreciate the black and white filming.  It's perfect for the time period portrayed. It's perfect for capturing the atmosphere of those dark and dingy, sometimes dangerous pool halls of that era where playing for money was the name of the game.  Finally, I purchased this DVD Collector's Edition as a replacement for the VCR.  The second disc of interviews and insights into the making of this film is a fine addition to the to this set and added more to my understanding of the film and its production.  But still, there is the game... and when it comes to straight pool (the only real pocket billiards variation worth playing), Willie Mosconi, ""Minnesota Fats"" and ""Fast Eddie"" Felson are yet the original mentors for this now older, but still fairly talented player.",1476144000,3,1088,4.582474226804123

Basically, once Paul Newman gives up his former career to take up pool hustling, the movie slows to a crawl. We watch very long scenes of pool playing, very long scenes of him and his girlfriend...and everything moves so slowly, I lost interest and dozed off.

The concept was good, but it needed more than long pool-playing sequences. The scenes continued longer than they needed to, and we never learn much about the protagonist or what motivates him to want to be a big-time pool hustler. We see what he does, but never come to learn why he is doing it. Disappointing.",1464307200,,674,4.479674796747967

Even though it's 2 hours and 15 minutes, it was so entertaining the time just flew by.  Newman, Gleason, Piper and Scott were all excellent in their parts.  Plus the 2-disc collector's edition has a lot of extras (which I still have to watch), including a commentary.  Warning, this is not a fast-moving adventure movie.  There's no gratuitous violence (though there is some violence) and nothing gets blown up.  A lot of it takes place in pool rooms.  It's psychological and people making bad choices.  Great movie.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Hustler was nominated for Nine Oscars, winning for cinematography and art direction for a black and white film. The four main actors deservedly received nominations, although George C. Scott refused his. It was the second nomination for Paul Newman, the first of three for Piper Laurie and Jackie Gleasons only nomination. The film deserved the recognition, but West Side Story ended up with 10 Oscars that year. Newman received an honorary Oscar in 1986 and won a best supporting actor Oscar a year later when he reprised the role of Eddie Felson in The Color of Money.

The film is quite complex. Although a sports movie on the surface, theres a strong romantic element. The story is essentially about strength of character. What would you do to get what you want in life? What if it means hurting people close to you? Is the goal worth the sacrifices? And, most important of all, how do we define success? Paul Newman was an emerging force in 1961, but his popularity hadnt reached its peak. His portrayal of Fast Eddie Felson was convincing. He only took the role because another film he had committed to fell through.

Fast Eddie Felson [Paul Newman] begins the story as a pool player who is building his reputation. He wants to take on the best and prove that hes the better player. There are definite similarities between Fast Eddie Felsons place in the pool world and Paul Newmans status in the acting world at the time. We learn in the opening scenes that Fast Eddie Felson is a hustler. While playing a game with Charlie Burns [Myron McCormick], his manager, he deliberately misses his shots and also pretends to be drunk. The people watching are fooled and he wins $105 by betting that he can make a difficult shot and pulling it off. Then he leaves with Charlie Burns and they look for victims in another town. This is Fast Eddie Felsons life. He makes a living conning people who don't know that he has real ability. Fast Eddie Felson isn't satisfied and dreams of making $10,000 in one night. In order to reach his lofty goal, he plans to play the best pool player in the country, Minnesota Fats [Jackie Gleason]. Minnesota Fats hasn't lost a game for 15 years and has heard of Fast Eddie Felson. He agrees to the game. Charlie visits and we learn that he has $1,500 which was his cut of Fast Eddie Felsons previous pool winnings. Fast Eddie Felson is angry and decides to cut Charlie Burns out of his life. Sarah Packard [Piper Laurie] wonders if shes next. This part of the film moves a little slowly and some viewers may lose interest, but I felt it worked and was essential to give the film depth and additional meaning.

The stakes begin at $200 and quickly build to $1,000 per game. Fast Eddie Felson is cocky and talks a good game, but also backs it up with good play. Hes soon ahead by over $11,000 and Charlie Burns wants him to quit, but Fast Eddie Felson says hell play until Minnesota Fats [Jackie Gleason] says the game is over. He doesnt just want to win, hes looking to humiliate Fats and break his spirit. After 12 hours, Fast Eddie Felson is ahead $18,000, but still insists on continuing the game. You can see where the story is heading. Minnesota Fats freshens up, washes his hands and puts powder on them. Fast Eddie Felson teases him on how beautiful he looks. Minnesota Fats starts winning and Fast Eddie Felson keeps drinking. He eventually loses everything apart from $200. Who was hustling whom?

The pace of the film changes after the initial meeting with Minnesota Fats and Fast Eddie Felson doesnt have the necessary stake money for another game. He meets Sarah Packard [Piper Laurie] and eventually moves in with her. She has a limp from having polio as a child and enjoys drinking even more than Fast Eddie Felson. The two are a good match and each has flaws. The pace picks up when Fast Eddie Felson meets Bert Gordon [George C. Scott] who is Minnesota Fats manager and witnessed the first game between the two. Bert says that Fats was on the hook for the first time in 10 years, but Fast Eddie Felson let him off. He calls Fast Eddie Felson a born loser, but a loser with talent. He wants to be his manager and demands 75 percent of any winnings. He also issues a warning that Fast Eddie Felson could get hurt if he wanders into the wrong pool hall and they realise that hes hustling.

After learning a few life lessons, Fast Eddie Felson takes Bert up on his offer. He takes Sarah for a meal and she comments that its the first time shes seen him wear a tie. Its a sign that he is willing to change. The two go on the road with Bert and Fast Eddie Felson plays billiards for big stakes. Billiards isn't his game of choice; he prefers pool. Fast Eddie Felson loses initially, but something in his demeanour convinces Bert to continue staking him. He eventually wins enough for another showdown with Minnesota Fats. The final 10 minutes of the film show the second game between the two. Fast Eddie Felson has changed since the first meeting and life has toughened him up. Hes still brash, but won't take a drink while hes playing. I won't reveal who wins, but the film reflects on how we define winning and success in life.

The film has an authentic feel. The pool rooms are dark, seedy and potentially dangerous places. They match the gritty feel of the film. The pool scenes were shot in real pool halls rather than on a set. The only thing that wasn't convincing is the way the actors held a cue in a few shots. A professional player wouldnt have his head so far away from the cue and certainly wouldnt wear a jacket in case it touched another ball and caused a foul shot. But the actors did a good job and both performed most of their shots. The remainder were performed by former billiards world champion Willie Mosconi.

The Hustler is an outstanding film. It's a great story brought to life by a talented cast at the hands of a capable director. The grittiness of the city and the lives of these people are visceral, thanks in part to Academy Award-winning work of cinematographer Eugene Shuftan and art director Harry Horner and set decorator Gene Callahan. But the person who gained the most from The Hustler was Paul Newman. Although he had survived his disastrous debut in The Silver Chalice [1954] to become a popular leading man and male sex symbol, Paul Newman's performance in The Hustler propelled him into the top ranks of actors and made him the reigning male superstar of the next decade. The role, and Paul Newman's performance of it, also paved the way for the rebel anti-heroes of the 60s, the tormented, less-than-sympathetic characters who would be the central focus of many films and performances by the likes of such 1970s successors to Fast Eddie as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox presents The Hustler in its original Cinemascope ratio of 2:35:1 with a faithful transfer. When dealing with the black and white photography of catalogue releases results seem to be a mixed bag, but this boasts great clarity in image with only slight blurring around the edges that inherently comes with the use of wide lenses. Certain textures aren't as sharp as they could be, but the picture is void of any grain, specks, or debris, and delivers great depth of detail. What matters most is the translation of performance, and that is what shines about this transfer. Take for instance the final scene that uses the wide frame to show Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, and George C. Scott in the same shot. Scott is situated in the background of the shot, but his performance is of the utmost importance. In earlier transfers of this film, the intensity of Scotts face before he shouts YOU OWE ME MONEY! is almost lost. But it, along with the nuanced performance of every actor, is beautifully presented.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There are always inherent audio problems when filming on location. Considering the technology at the time, the coherence of the audio is remarkable. Even still, there remains a consistent hiss throughout the film that while not necessarily distracting is ever present. The biggest problem comes with sudden sharp sounds that seem to be lost  especially a smashed cup of coffee is almost entirely lost as the sound peaks. Even still, there is nothing nearly enough to ruin the experience of this film. In fact 20th Century Foxs 5.1 DTS-HD Audio Mastering of the original mono track provides a great representation of the while still remaining faithful to the original vision of the film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: 20th Century Foxs dedication to their catalogue releases is quite impressive. They have pulled no stops in presenting as much material as they could for this release, and there is very little to complain about. The smallest qualm would be that this cries out to be two discs, but somehow they managed to consolidate everything into a single disc by providing half of the features in standard definition.

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Stuart Galbraith: Stuart Galbraith compiles this audio commentary from personal interviews with the cast, crew, and relatives of the filmmakers. Actors Paul Newman and Stefan Gierasch, assistant director Ulu Grosbard, film editor Dede Allen, Carol Rossen (director Robert Rossens daughter), and film historians Richard Schickel and Jeff Young share their thoughts and memories of The Hustler. This commentary is quite insightful, but most of the information can be gleaned from the other special features. The most interesting and worthy part of the commentary is the insight Dede Allen provides about the editing process and its place in cinema history.

Special Feature: Paul Newman at Fox [2011] [1080p] [27:11] This is a brief overview of Paul Newmans career from his rise to fame as a pretty boy in the studio system, his independent sense of filmmaking, and his foray into philanthropy and auto racing. This feature was produced specifically for this release by 20th Century Fox, and puts more of a focus on Paul Newmans time spent at 20th Century Fox with pictures like The Hustler and Rally Round the Flag, Boys! and other productions with his wife Joanne Woodward. Other contributors include Rick Jewell, Scott Klavan, Jonathan Kuntz, Eric Lax, Thomas Schatz and Gene Shalit. Directed by John Cork.

Special Feature: Jackie Gleason: The Big Man [2011] [1080p] [12:04] This mini-biography delves into the unconventional casting of the television comedian in a serious role, and what Jackie Gleason brought to the film that no other actor could. This also briefly goes into his history with television, and his post-Hustler film career. Other contributors include Rick Jewell and Thomas Schatz.

Special Feature: The Real Hustler: Walter Tevis [2011] [1080p] [18:55] Walter Tevis is the author of the novel that The Hustler is based upon. This mini-documentary provides the background on the author who struggled with alcoholism and the difficulties of writing. Other contributors include Ross Klavan and Julie Tevis McGory.

Special Feature: Life in the Fast Lane: Fast Eddie Felson and the Search for Greatness [2007] [480i] [11:49] Interviews with actors Paul Newman, Piper Laurie, Michael Constantine, film editor Dede Allen, film historian Dr. Drew Casper, reflect on the power of The Hustler. The commentary of the interviewees ranges from incredibly insightful to merely entertaining. Great anecdotes and analysis can be found here. Directed by Constantine Nasr.

Special Feature: Milestones in Cinema History: The Hustler [2007] [480i] [28:04] Another deliberation on The Hustler in its place in cinema history with interviews with Dr. Drew Casper, Paul Newman, Michael Constantine, Piper Laurie, and Dede Allen. This is a great commentary that will give viewers a new perspective on the film. Directed by Constantine Nasr.

Special Feature: Swimming with Sharks: The Art of the Hustle [2006] [480i] [9:38] Professional pool players and authors explain the history of the game of pool as well as a background on the act of hustling. Tricks of the trade are divulged in how to spot a hustler, and the thorough research that one must endure to become a successful hustler.

Special Feature: The Hustler: The Inside Story [2002] [480i] [24:32] Actor Jerry Orbach, World Artistic Champion Mike Massey, assistant director Ulu Grosbard, Carol Eve Rossen, Richard Schickel, and other billiard historians give yet another outlook on how The Hustler fits into the history of the game of pocket billiards. This feature also talks a bit about the research that the actors and crew went through to prepare for the film. Other contributors include Stanley Cohen, Jackie Gleason (archive footage), Piper Laurie (archive footage), Willie Mosconi (archive footage), Paul Newman (archive footage), Robert Rossen (archive footage), George C. Scott (archive footage) and Charles Ursitti. Narrated by Bruce Chandler. Directed by  David Naylor.

Special Feature: Paul Newman: Hollywoods Cool Hand [2005] [480i] [43:44] This is an episode of Biography [TV Series] with the focus on Paul Newman. It provides a more in-depth look at Newmans career and life than Newman at 20th Century Fox, with by providing candid interviews with Paul Newman and wife Joanne Woodward. While forty-four minutes doesnt seem like enough time to cover the entire life of a man as talented and intriguing as Paul Newman, this hits all of the interesting points.

Special Feature: Trick Shot Analysis by Mike Massey [2011] [480i] [13:51] Perhaps the least interesting feature on this disc, Pool Champion Mike Massey gives his commentary on the pool playing from each scene in the film. His nervous demeanour provides little insight and culminates in him dictating whats happening on screen.

Special Feature: How to Make the Shot [2011] [480i] [3:41] Again, Mike Masseys nervous on-screen persona doesnt provide anything too useful here, he demonstrates mostly that he can make the trick shots seen in the film, and not necessarily how to make them, as the title of this feature suggests.

Theatrical Trailers [1961] [1080p] American and Spanish Trailers of The Hustler.

Finally, bolstered by a quartet of simply amazing performances by Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie and George C. Scott. This is an acting tour de force the likes of which must have amazed 1961 audiences. The film's achievement is so shattering that the depth, nuance and power of those performances seem hardly diminished by the intervening years. Though The Hustler is undeniably seedy, and it's a gritty, grimy look at desperate characters trying to carve out a piece of their own twisted version of the American Dream. It's sad, it's compelling and it is completely and utterly unforgettable. The ensemble cast also seized the opportunity to make this a breakthrough movie for them. Piper Laurie got the chance to break the mould of pretty ingnue parts she had mostly been offered for a decade. Jackie Gleason, whose film career had gone nowhere in the 50s, was able to prove he was a dramatic actor to be reckoned with and not just a popular TV comedy star. New York stage actor George C. Scott added another outstanding performance to his early film career, and garnered perhaps the best reviews of the picture, today, many people consider George C. Scott's and Jackie Gleason's performances to hold far more interest than that of the leading actors. An appropriately nervous jazz score keeps the eardrums sharp. The Hustler is one of the most compelling character-based films to emerge from the decade of the 1960s. Very Highly Recommended!

As an actor, I was just floored by four of the best acting jobs ever in complex roles (great screenwriting) that we rarely get to see: Paul Newman -- his portrayal of a tortured man is perhaps his best (the Oscar he won for Color of Money was really an attempt to rectify the mistake they made by not giving it to him for Hustler); George C. Scott -- a hateful villain with many layers -- I had seen him on Broadway but this was the first time I remember him on film; Jackie Gleason -- showing what a fine dramatic actor he was; and perhaps most of all -- Piper Laurie -- her performance as Newman's female counterpart is absolutely staggering (she lost to Sophia Loren for The Women -- Sophia was good too, and that is the problem with the Oscars -- how do you pick just one?). The direction (Robert Rosson -- his masterpiece) and cinematography were glorious. The only problem with this picture is that it is so realistic that it is difficult to watch at times -- the characters are presented full-on warts and all, unlike the pre-1950s Hollywood. Definitely one of my all-time favorites.",1440806400,,1242,4.404347826086957

Paul Newman  as Fast Eddie Felsen, one of the character that made him famous and for which he could win an Oscar.
Piper Laurie  as Oscar nominated plays the doomed love interest. Standout performances come from Jackie Gleason, breaking his Ralph Cramden persona to play a hustler, and most notably George C. Scott, as Newman's oily manager.

Robert Rossen directs in the same gritty style which works well for the milieu. The movie is very good, it's shot in black and white and has some decent cinematography and acting, despite the hokey script, but it's such a downer that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when it's over.",1438905600,,719,4.736

He plays Fast Eddie Felson, a small time alcoholic pool hustler, who wants nothing more than to beat Minnesota Fats played to near perfection by Jackie Gleason. George C. Scott has a wonderful role as a gambler who backs Eddie for a comeback after Eddie gets beaten by Fats. Piper Laurie does a fine job as an alcoholic love interest of sort for Eddie.

Pretty much every character in this film is an amoral and dislikeable con artist, except for Fats. He lets Eddie hustle himself in their first meeting, and graciously admits defeat in their second.

You may get the urge to go play pool after seeing the movie, but don't do it. Pool halls are filled with alcoholic drug addicts who will do anything for their next fix of a drug they call 'Chalk.' You don't want to become a Chalk addict, do you? If you do, you will have to sell you your children and force your spouse and new puppy to turn tricks to pay for your new addiction. If you are a male, you will never be able look at 'things' the same way again, if you know what I mean. If you are a woman, you will never be able to look at 'things' the same way again either. If you are a great ape, such as a gorilla, you will probably not be interested in the movie or playing pool, so you're fine to just go eat the popcorn.

Whenever daylight threatens to creep in and impinge upon the night world, the main characters take evasive action, whether by slumping down in booths at the bus terminal coffee shop, or by having the window shades drawn shut.  The only time that the ultra-smooth Minnesota Fats (marvelously portrayed by Jackie Gleason) starts to lose his temper is when the building porter starts to open the window shades, thus allowing morning daylight to cast menacing stripes across the pool table in violation of one of the unwritten rules of the game that has been in progress since after midnight.",1424563200,,896,5.0134228187919465

Newman's acting is brilliant and some of the pool shooting is actually him taking the shots.  George C Scott is quite a character, with fewer lines than you remember, he brings the character to life with style and class.
Great writing brings together a fantastic cast of characters.

If not for Piper Laurie this would be 5 Stars.  She was brilliantly written, a character you can ""Feel"". Some of  Piper's drunk acting needed some work, not the most convincing.  Still a strong performance and an amazing story",1422835200,,527,4.811111111111111

596902,5,630321245X,"A tough, raw, hard-hearted story of Eddie Felsen (Paul Newman) who
 wants to move up from two bit hustling at pool to beat the best, Minnesota
 Fats (Jackie Gleason). Great pool scenes: Fats' seven- ball in the corner
 is a shot Eddie Charlton would be proud of. Newman is also highly
 competent, although he joked of shooting some pool decades later when a
 youth approached, declaring he'd seen The Hustler dozens of times and that
 watching Newman play pool was one of the great disappointments of his life.
 Perhaps Eddie does shoot good but also lucky. Great camera work closes with
 great cue-work, giving us a lounge lizard's eye view. Fats is a wily but
 honourable adversary, taciturn and calculating.

Piper Laurie's lush, Sarah (or whatever her name is today) is magnificent,
 matchless, a smart, damaged, feisty woman done down by booze and bastards.
 Her relationship with Eddie is really interesting, swinging from ""What do
 you want me to do, just step out in the alley?"" to ""I got a fella!"" to ""We
 have a contract of depravity"". As Newman says: ""I never hustled you, even
 when I thought I was.""

The other standout performance is George C Scott as the gambler/businessman,
 Bert Gordon. The ultimate cynic, Bert pegs Eddie as a born loser who has
 talent but not character. (Character in this context is a concoction, not a
 reality.) Bert's homily in the bar with Eddie after he has found his 'excuse
 to lose' and blown his shot at Fats is one cruel, brutish, motivational
pep-talk.

The clashes between Sarah and Bert are electrifying. Bert says he knows
 what Eddie was thinking when he folded against Fats because he's been there
 himself; then, peering at her, he adds ""We've all been there haven't we,
 Miss Packard?"" And when Sarah accuses him of owning all the tomorrows
 because he buys them today (cheap), he responds, with a smirk, ""Well, nobody
 has to sell."" In the event, no one comes out of this story undamaged.

Rich, raw, cold and in lovely black and white, with authentic support
 players (including Jake LaMotta of all people, as a barman), this is one to
 see, but bear in mind, this is Ames, Mister. While you're in town, it's
 best not to hustle pool at Arthur's Pool Hall down at the docks, or risk
 your thumbs with Turk Baker.",1421020800,2,2271,4.687817258883249

596905,5,630321245X,"Incredible movie, applicable to not just pool but sports and life overall.

I found the real life chess game of Botvinnik v. Fischer tracked the movie.  Botvinnik was the 3 time world champion, Fischer, a young upstart with undeniable talent.  Winning the US championship at 14, entering a world qualifying tournament with the top players in the world, he quipped, I'll draw with the top grandmasters and there's 5 or 10 fish I'll beat easily.  Sounds like cocky Fast Eddie.

The game occurs in the world chess Olympiad putting the U.S,. v Russia ( a crowd just like the movie).  Seemingly foolishly, Fisher played the Grunfeld walking into Botvinnik's favorite variation.  Winning the world championship, the Russian had carefully analyzed the variation, playing his findings in carefully organized notebooks. Following the old game, BOOM, Fischer made an enormous move, a pseudo-Queen sacrifice.  Later Botvinnik he had overlooked the move in his hours of preparation and Fischer found it at the board.  Somewhat flustered, Fischer quicked secured a large advantage and was a clear pawn up by the 25th move, generally enough to win.

Remember Fast Eddie drinking and getting a little cocky, one detects some overconfidence in Fischer.  While ahead, he does not play the most precise moves, with one remembering Eddie's words I can win anyway I want.  Fischer  trades into a rook ending, but is still up a pawn and they go to a break adjournment, like the movie.  Most predict a quick win and Fischer goes confidently to bed while the Russian spends hours through the night with his team.  Like Eddie,  Fischer was a loaner while Botvinnik like Fats had assistants and backup.  Late in the night one of those assistants, Geller, finds a possibility.

The ending turns out to have some hidden tricks which Botvinnik unfurls on an overconfident Fischer and secures the draw.

Newman has all the charisma of Steve McQueen in ""The Cincinnati Kid"", but where McQueen leaves the film broken and broke, Newman succeeds inwardly, though is permanently banned from any big league pool hall by Scott's character.

Each of these characters face the same question we all do every day: ""How much can you bend without breaking ... without compromising oneself to the pressures around you?""

Jackie Gleason as ""Fats"" is cool, calm, collected, and suave as all helljust a perfect  roll for Gleason is all I can say. This film is less about pool and more about a man searching for what he is truly worth, as Joseph Campbell would say, he is on the Hero's Journey. Classic film, great actors, and all around winner. Add this to your noir collection or be left out in the cold.",1418428800,,596,4.008403361344538
597658,5,630321245X,"I had seen this many years ago and also on occasion when it would be run on commercial TV. I was very pleased to see it show up on Amazon Prime video. I sat down and absorbed it fully.

I also searched it out in Amazon's book department, I think the Kindle version was $1.99. Bought that and just finished reading it this morning. This is one of those rare movies when the movie is better than the book.

I won't give anything away, for those who might want to read the book and compare it to the movie, but I will say this: Much of the script was taken directly from the book, I like that. Newman was a very good fit for Eddie I pictured him when I was reading. G.C. Scott, did not fit the physical description of Bert but surely had the personality down, though I pictured him when I read. Piper Laurie also did  fit the physical description of Sarah and I used my mental picture of Sarah more than Piper while reading...though at times Piper showed up in my mind's eye when I read. And to compare plot to plot, there were some MAJOR differences. Again I will not give anything away but the movie does not follow the book in several ways. Its the differences in the movie that make it a far more interesting story than the book.

On to the movie. All the major characters were outstanding. Eddie (Newman), Bert (Scott), Sarah (Laurie) and Fats (Gleason) were superb. The young hustler that played Eddie in the brutal bar scene, played the character in the book to a T ! I enjoyed seeing Willie Mosconi  play his small part as Willie. Mosconi was without a doubt one of the best pocket billiards players to have ever lived.

The movie flowed along nicely with no boring scenes. The development of Eddie's personality was a joy to watch. All in all this movie is uplifting and inspiring, despite the tragedy involved. In some ways Newman was like his character in Cool Hand Luke, a man who never gives up. The one game with Fats reminded me of Luke's fight with Dragline.

Anyway, if you have never seen The Hustler, and especially if you know and like the game of pool, this is a must see movie. Even if you know nothing about pool, this is a great character study of the types of people who make their money off of the unsuspecting ones among us.

598127,5,630321245X,"Over the years I've watched eighty eight movies on the original list of the AFI Top 100 Movies of all-time and of those eighty eight movies there are about four or five films I would drop.  Of the list of the AFI Tenth Year Anniversary Top 100 I've seen eighty three movies and though I was pleased to see ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was added to the group I was disappointed to find the AFI dropped both ""Fargo"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"".  Of that list I would drop about seven or eight of the newly listed films as well.  As the original four to five films I'd drop still remained on the new list this makes a total of eleven to thirteen spots that, in my opinion could be filled by better American films.

If I'm being honest most of the more intelligent movies these days do not come out of America.  A lot of them come out of Europe.  Take for instance recent gems ""The Lives of Others"", ""Head On"" and ""Revanche"" to name a few which are far superior to such embarrassing Oscar winners  as ""Juno"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the insipid and idiotic ""Her"".  But back in 1961 at the start of a great boom in American cinema that would run up through the end of 1976, a timeless film came into being that any country and any generation could be proud of.  It was based on Walter Tevis' first novel of the same name and it was called ""The Hustler"".

The best description of the film I've ever come across is ""A Greek Tragedy played out in pool halls"".  And that is precisely what it is.  Shot in stark and glorious black and white the story tells a tale about the quest to be a winner and the price one must pay to achieve such a goal.  The argument of the story or the premise if you will is ""In order to win one must have character"".  The definition of both what it is to win and what denotes character is argued throughout the script.  Eddie, the lead character, thinks winning equates with money and beating the best pool player around; Minnesota Fats whom he loses to in the first act and hungers to beat passionately from that point on.  The villain Bert Gordon, who becomes Eddie's new manager, claims everyone has talent but not necessarily character and also believes winning equates with wealth but also that with wealth comes power.  But the voice of reason in the story encompassed by Eddie's intelligent polio stricken alcoholic writer girlfriend Sarah Packard argues differently saying because Eddie possesses both a wealth of talent and an uncommon passionate love for the game he is a winner already.  And with this the battle lines are drawn.

The names of the characters in the story are paramount.  Sarah brings this to light in an early scene where she is sitting in a bar with Eddie whom she has just met.  She asks him if he wants to know what the name Sarah means and there is reason for this.  The name ""Sarah"" means ""Princess"".  Her last name ""Packard"" means ""one who packs"" which she finds herself having to do in order to keep Eddie.  The name Burt means ""Illustrious"" with his last name Gordon meaning ""Large Fortification"".  The name Eddie means ""Wealthy Guard"" and his surname Felson may allude to the translation ""fallen son"".  Each name says something about the characters that may on the surface seem less than what they are as they dwell in the seedy and smoky world they inhabit.  But do not be fooled.  As Sarah points out Eddie is wealthy already.  He's a talented winner who has already won her heart and doesn't need to beat Minnesota Fats to prove himself.  But Burt, who has money but does not possess talent, passion or princess, is the devil on Eddie's shoulder urging him on to play Minnesota Fats again...and hustle some wealthy billiards players on the way as a means to use Eddie to line his pockets and feed his ego in his own twisted quest to be a winner.

Eddie's drive to beat Minnesota Fats in a rematch makes him desperate and blind to Bert's manipulations.  Bert's jealousy of Eddie's talent and the egotistical thrill of using him to make money are threatened by Sarah's intelligence and ability to see through his schemes and he fights to get rid of her.  Sarah's insecurities about her deformity and her love for Eddie make her vulnerable despite her insightful ability to see through the haze and distinguish the truth about each of the men.  This volatile combination needs amongst the three characters builds a tension that grows mesmerizingly until it reaches its explosive and unforgettable conclusion.

This is an extraordinary film with standout performances all around.  Jackie Gleason is perfectly cast as the cool headed pool champion Minnesota Fats.  George C. Scott is excellent as a sleazy business man who as Sarah's character marvelously points out is a Roman who has to have it all.  Piper Laurie plays Sarah with a convincing pitch perfect balance of brains, strength and fragility.  And in one of his best if not his very best performance Paul Newman plays Fast Eddie brilliantly showing us all the power and fissures in this engaging and tragically flawed man.  The directing is spot on bringing us straight into a seedy underground of early 1960's pool halls filled with desperation and the struggle for triumph.  And the writing is top notch with its complex layers drawing us into its characters and its themes which keep us riveted from beginning to end.

It still shocks me even now that ""The Hustler"" did not make the AFI Top One Hundred.  The movie is a brilliant timeless testament to America's obsession with winning.  Possibly the best ever.  All one needs to do is turn on a television set where from sports to reality shows to awards shows we can how relevant it's premise remains to this day.  Of all the great American films ever made, ""The Hustler"" may just be the most overlooked masterpiece of them all.",1409875200,4,5797,4.595330739299611

598199,4,630321245X,"Still fascinating, despite the passage of years. Fast Eddie's flaw is gripping. The speech by Scott about the difference between talent and character is brilliant, and that starts the journey. Or it should start it. Unfortunately, the plot gets confused. Very confused. At the outset, Eddie can't win because he lacks character. We resonate with that, and we feel that Scott understands why Eddie is a loser. But the cure takes us into a very different story, one in which the creation of character becomes something evil and results in the suicide of Fast Eddie's girl. At the end, Eddie finally has enough character to win, but the character he has is hideous and he wants to shed it. Wha? The film gets lost, but along the way, a lot of powerful things occur. Well worth repeated viewings. Three knocks, in my view. The big one is the confused story line. Second, there is a bit too much stilted dialogue at the end. The filmmaker is trying to make a profound point, but the story doesn't support it, and the heavy-handed dialogue makes matters worse. Third, I have a general irritation with film people wallowing in lowlife characters. The film glories in the smoky pool halls and alcoholism and cheesy morals, but then comes down on it all at the end. This is the same kind of hypocrisy that gives us glorified crime, glorified white southern trash, and so on. Film people love slumming it.",1409097600,,1395,4.697959183673469

I think it's Paul Newman's greatest performance (which is saying something since he was in a lot of good pictures) and the supporting cast is superb. Jackie Gleason's portrayal of Minnesota Fats is elegant and stylish but also deft and subtle---he plays the part with a cool panache. Piper Laurie is the tragically wounded love interest of Newman and George C Scott is diabolical and shark-like as the ruthless gambler Bert Gordon. This movie has it all--great acting, a great script, and a beautiful black and white cinematography that adds a dimension of smoky grittiness to the story. And the Kenyon Hopkins score compliments the mood perfectly----a combination of hip jazz and mellow blues that fits each scene like a glove!!

I think George C. Scott was born to play dark characters.

This is one of the greats.  The story revolves around a neophyte pool hustler trying to make the bigtime, and finding out it takes more than skills w/ a cue stick to succeed.

598443,5,630321245X,"The Hustler is a widely acclaimed film with an all-star cast. It won 2 of its 9 Oscar nominations,with all four of its 4 principal actors, Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott, and Piper Laurie each receiving nominations for their acting performances. Although it was one of Newman's early roles, it wasn't his first. He had already made the A-list in 1956 playing Rocky Graziano in ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" reaffirming his star power and popularity in 1958 as the male lead opposite Elizabeth Taylor in ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof."" Jackie Gleason, was best known at the time as a comedian, variety show host, and creator of the ""Honeymooners"" TV comedy, starring in its lead role. In a completely non-comedic role, he plays Minnesota Fatst, a pool hustler widely acclaimed as the best in the country. It shows an entirely different aspect of Gleason's acting ability. Fast Eddie (Newman) has become obsessed with beating Minnesota Fats in a match. Tension among the characters steadily builds, particularly among Newman, Laurie and Scott, to the very end. Shot in B&W with which the director, Rossen, was more comfortable and accustomed to than color, it is entirely appropriate for the gritty and grimy old pool hall settings that comprise most of the film. While The Hustler may be classed by some as a ""pool film"" and it certainly increased the popularity of pool when originally released, it's not about pool or pool sharks. The game and its hustlers are only the vehicle for Fast Eddie attempting to find himself and salvation with Sara (Piper Laurie) who was slightly crippled by polio as a child, but she's not the only one flawed. The other three are flawed, being driven by their own character crippling demons. The film was unique and shocking in 1961 with its emotional intensity. It will seem tamer now, but maintains a compelling, gut wrenching outcome at the end, and that is the film's timeless power.

Blu-ray transfer has excellent grayscale with good contrast and is clean. Grain is present but handled well without sacrificing detail. The audio is limited by its original monaural source of low fidelity monaural source of low fidelity by today's standards. It has been reworked to 5.1, but the low fidelity shows with the opening Fox theme and logo. There is a 2.0 option if desired but it does not improve the overall fidelity.

Overcoming small mindedness, defeatism, and the lack of belief in oneself in order to become so great at what one does, that ones 'game' acquires a zen like fluidity, constitutes a profound human longing.

Sarah:  Is he a winner?

Sarah:  Is that what makes a winner?

  As unfounded as the McCarthy era witch hunts proved to be, much of the artistic output of the so-called ""communist sympathizers"" did have this in common: an indictment of the American Dream (or perhaps more accurately: the American Dream as a cautionary tale).  Robert Rossen's THE HUSTLER no doubt falls into this category.

  More than anything, Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) wants to be the best pool hustler there is.  And that means beating Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  ""It's like a morgue,"" Eddie's partner comments as they enter the pool hall where he's to do battle, ""the pools tables are like slabs they lay the stiffs on.""  Act One ends with Eddie lying on the floor--broke, dead drunk, having lost the pool game--the latest corpse sacrificed on the altar of 1961-era Corporate Greed.

  Act Two begins with him meeting Sarah (Piper Laurie): a lost soul (much like Eddie) who provides solace & wisdom and who nurses him back to health after the beatings given to him by Minnesota Fats (figuratively) and a bunch of thugs he meets at the pool hall ARTHUR'S (literally).  It is Sarah, in fact, who understands Eddie better than he understands himself when she tells him he's a winner.  Not because he's rich.  Not because he's the best.  But because he's alive--alive with the pure, unadulterated, incorruptible joy he gets when he uses his God-Given talent.  ""The pool cue's a part of me,"" he tells her.  ""I just had to show'em, what the game's like when it's great.  When it's REALLY great.  How anything can be great.  Bricklaying can be great.  If a guy KNOWS.""  This after Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) has told him he's a born loser.

  Bert Gordon:  Cynical.  Greedy.  Student of human moves.  He knows Eddie's the best pool player he's ever seen.  ""I never saw anybody shoot pool the way you shot the other night against Minnesota Fats,"" he tells Eddie.  But he still calls Eddie a loser.  Why?  Because by the end of the game, Fats has all the money.  ""This game isn't like football.  You don't get paid for yardage,"" he tells Eddie.  And so THE HUSTLER  is really about a tug of war.  For Eddie's soul.

  Bert pulls him one direction--towards being successful at all costs.  Winning isn't everything.  It's the only thing.  You keep score real simple.

The Hustler is probably the greatest movie about pool that ever was and not only just because of the slick billiard playing, sharp dialogue and snazzy music but the hard lighting, dark shadows and quick camera movement also give the film it's character.

The way The Hustler created the image of relentless determination could have easily been told by the camera and lighting alone. This film gave off that kind of nostalgic look and feel to it that makes you think all that exists in this world is bourbon, broads, bills and billiards. The main thing that was unique about this film was how the whole poolroom style was created, which went on to influence filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese who helmed the sequel to The Hustler, The Color of Money.

598625,5,630321245X,"Shoot pool, Fast Eddie, shoot pool. Yes, Fast Eddie shoot pool like your life depended on it. Fast Eddie coming like hellfire out of the west, out of the wild boy, okie, arkie dust shaking be-bop west night looking, looking for something in the go-go post- World War II night. Some cureless thing to take the curse off of not having made that okie trek with everything you owned in the Great Depression or not having gotten your fill of blood, action and danger in the ""big one."" Something to take the pain, the angst, the alienation or whatever the sociologists and psychologists wanted to call it, away.

But like the headline says it ain't about the pool as this 1961 Paul Newman (Fast Eddie) film under review, The Hustler, makes very clear. For Fast Eddie it was, or it started out as, just creeping out from under that old East Oakland, Haywood, Richmond, you name the town they were all the same, all filled with restless boys wishing to break out from that corner boy existence. Hanging out in white tee shirt, cigarette pack rolled up one sleeve, wide bucket belt, whipsaw ready,  holding up blue denims, black engineer boots hitched up against some drugstore , mom and pop variety store , some bowling alley, hell, some  glass-fronted pool hall wall to break- out, jail-break out but just then waiting , yeh, waiting.

But hunger, gnawed hunger, festering hunger is a tyrant, a hard and cruel tyrant, when you have Fast Eddie appetites.  Yes, Fast Eddie, just join the drifters, grifters, and midnight sifters and make a name, a small name for yourself, in the fifteen minutes of fame world and then fade. Small dreams fade. Not our boy Fast Eddie though he wanted more, he wanted way more, he was hungry, really too hungry. He wanted to be the king hell king of the pool hall night, small dream in a big dream world but it was his dream  and he was sticking to it, come hell or high water. Jesus was he going to stick to it.

To watch Fast Eddie shoot pool when he was fast and loose was a sight to behold, shifting those hips just this way and that, a wayward shoulder here or there, eyeing, careful eyeing the best angle for the shot like he and the balls were one, and maybe they were, beating up angels to get at the chalk to fatten up his cue stick, and then go on those runs. Hell some nights he would run the table just to show some punk that he should get back to hanging off that wall at the mom and pop variety store corner that he crawled out from under. Jesus. Still he wanted pharaoh. He wanted the king hell king, Minnesota Fats (played by Jackie Gleason with serious style).

And he got Fats, got Fats in spades. Got more of  Fats that most men, even hard corner boys, would ever want. Got Fats with his blood up, with his king hell king no prisoners blood up. Jesus Fast Eddie looked good for about ten rounds though all loose and Fast Eddie-like, making juke moves like some fancy dan pro football player, cocky, hell, cocky, calling strange shot combinations and drinking high-bench bourbon to steady his nerves. Beautiful.

Fats about that time, about round ten, took his measure though, writing him off as a fly-by-night seven- day wonder boy, making some fast and Fast Eddie -like moves of his own and some ballet-like combinations that had Fast Eddie reeling. Pharaoh- by a knock-out. The boys who watched most of the play, and they had watched Pharaoh up against some pretty good corner boys, all agreed that Fast Eddie was good, but that his talent could only get him so far and that his dreams maybe should be played out in Hoboken, or Jersey City not in the bigs. One guy, who didn't want to be quoted just in case, called Fast Eddie just another okie sodbuster loser.

But that guy, that no quote nine to five guy,  had never nursed a dream, never was haunted by being there at the end hearing the other guy, the pharaoh, cry to the high heavens ""uncle.""  Yeh, he had never heard that sweet music, and never would. And so Fast Eddie nursed his wounds, nursed his dream along too. He still had that too much hunger that comes from a rationed world, his world, his okie world, to carry. Fast Eddie was dumped back on cheap street, on the street of broken dreams.

And then she, Sarah (played by Piper Laurie), showed up, showed up to pick up the pieces, the Fast Eddie too much hunger pieces. To curb his hunger a little, maybe, and also to disturb his sleep. Some called her a tramp, an easy lay, a place to hang your hat while you were nursing your fresh wounds but Fast Eddie never, even from minute one, at the bus station diner saw her that way. And even wild corner boy sullen guys like Eddie who couldn't say the right words knew she was no whore, no dish rag to dirty and move on.

Funny how it all started, all started like with most Fast Eddie girls, with a few drinks, a few words, and some animal, not wild but not gentle either, connection that drove them to her bed. Polite society had called her a tramp, hanging on to a succession of beat down corner boys for dear life, maybe for her life. What could they know about a girl who wrote be-bop beat stuff, read a million books, and drank an ocean of whiskey before noon to chase away her own demons.  She was Fast Eddie's girl from the minute he sat down next to her, he knew it, she knew it, and that thought got her through some stuff.

Sarah, Fast Eddie's lifeline Sarah out of some biblical prophecy, out of those million books read, out of her own dark street past,  knew the ten percent men, men like gambler Bert (played by George C. Scott), knew their clawing and scratching away at a man's soul, at a woman's soul too when they got their blood up.  She knew, back streets knowledge knew at a heavy price, and a couple of off-hand bought drinks, that their price was too much to pay for fifteen minute fame dreams. Knew from her own much abused bed they had no pure Fast Eddie dreams, no Fast Eddie soul, just clawing away at more than their ten-percent cut. But would Fast Eddie listen, hell, not our boy, and so the dice were cast.

But see too some women (maybe some men too but I am thinking about a woman just now), no, forget some formless woman, let's call her Sarah Packard, can't live in the real world. Can't live in the world of dirt and dust, and blood and still take breathe. So Sarah could not save Fast Eddie from his too much hunger, or in the end save herself from her own hungers. Fast Eddie not knowing what he had lost, or only half-knowing, had to nevertheless even the score, even the score the only way he knew how. Take on the Fat Man or die.

As it turned out Fast Eddie danced that night of the re-match, all loose and fast like old Fast Eddie when he first worked his magic against some scrub surfer guy down in some southern California pool hall way out of his element in the 1950s be-bop night. The pockets were like manholes that night and everyone thought Fast Eddie was going to run the table on old tired Fats.  He didn't but old pharaoh, wise enough to know his play, cried ""uncle"" to the high heavens. That ""victory,"" that Sarah Packard -paid for victory however only tasted like ashes in Fast Eddie's mouth.

Director Robert Rossen died not long after the release of this masterpiece.  What a loss.  I haven't seen his subsequent film, ""Lilith,"" but, whatever its quality, the brilliance of this film suggests that further triumphs lay in his future.  ""The Hustler"" opens with a magnificent pool game.  Generally, one would assume that an even more impressive game, with more at stake for the characters and filmed with more emphasis, awaited us for the climax.  However, by the time the end of this film comes, we are deep in Felson's world and his tragic romance with the crippled drunkard Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie).  In terms of pure incident, the culminating pool game pales in comparison to the earlier match, but we have grown to know these characters so intimately that the stakes are much higher.

With a cigarette dangling between his lips, and a scene that will live in movie history, he plays against the legendary Minnesota Fats, brilliantly played by Jackie Gleeson.  They are two competing tigers as they circle the pool table in the testosterone laced atmosphere where it seems like anything can happen.

Later, cast as a viscous gambler, George C. Scott, manipulates the cocksure Newman into working for him by shooting pool against a wealthy Kentucky millionaire.  By then we have met Newman's romantic interest, Piper Laurie, cast as a pathetic alcoholic with her own sad story.  The film is a fast-paced gritty reality drama and succeeds on many levels.  I loved it.

Another thing I  enjoyed about the film is that it really captured the time and the place.  This was not a film about the sixties.  It WAS the sixties.  Everyone smoked cigarettes and the women wore white gloves and were subservient to the men.  Also, everything rang true, from the body language of the pool-house regulars to the discomfort felt by Piper Laurie an at upscale party.

The Hustler was nominated for nine Oscars, winning for cinematography and art direction for a black and white film. The four main actors deservedly received nominations, although George C. Scott refused his. It was the second nomination for Newman, the first of three for Piper Laurie and Jackie Gleason's only nomination. The film deserved the recognition, but West Side Story ended up with 10 Oscars that year. Newman received an honorary Oscar in 1986 and won a best supporting actor Oscar a year later when he reprised the role of Eddie Felson in The Color of Money.

The film is quite complex. Although a sports movie on the surface, there's a strong romantic element. The story is essentially about strength of character. What would you do to get what you want in life? What if it means hurting people close to you? Is the goal worth the sacrifices? And, most important of all, how do we define success?

Newman was an emerging force in 1961, but his popularity hadn't reached its peak. His portrayal of Eddie Felson was convincing. He only took the role because another movie he had committed to fell through.

Felson begins the story as a pool player who is building his reputation. He wants to take on the best and prove that he's the better player. There are definite similarities between Felson's place in the pool world and Newman's status in the acting world at the time. Both were looking to make a name for themselves.

We learn in the opening scenes that Felson is a hustler. While playing a game with Charlie, his manager, he deliberately misses shots he could make. He also pretends to be drunk. The people watching are fooled and he wins $105 by betting that he can make a difficult shot and pulling it off. Then he leaves with Charlie and they look for victims in another town. This is Felson's life. He makes a living conning people who don't know that he has real ability.

Felson isn't satisfied and dreams of making $10,000 in one night. In order to reach his lofty goal, he plans to play the best pool player in the country, Minnesota Fats (Gleason). Fats hasn't lost a game for 15 years and has heard of Felson. He agrees to the game.

The stakes begin at $200 and quickly build to $1,000 per game. Felson is cocky and talks a good game, but also backs it up with good play. He's soon ahead by over $11,000 and Charlie wants him to quit, but Felson says he'll play until Fats says the game is over. He doesn't just want to win, he's looking to humiliate Fats and break his spirit. After 12 hours, Felson is ahead $18,000, but still insists on continuing the game.

You can see where the story is heading. Fats freshens up, washes his hands and puts powder on them. Felson teases him on how beautiful he looks. Fats starts winning and Felson keeps drinking. He eventually loses everything apart from $200. Who was hustling whom?

The pace of the film changes after the initial meeting with Fats. Felson doesn't have the necessary stake money for another game. He meets Sarah Packard (Laurie) and eventually moves in with her. She has a limp from having polio as a child and enjoys drinking even more than Felson. The two are a good match and each has flaws.

Charlie visits and we learn that he has $1,500 which was his cut of Felson's previous pool winnings. Felson is angry and decides to cut Charlie out of his life. Sarah wonders if she's next. This part of the film moves a little slowly and some viewers may lose interest, but I felt it worked and was essential to give the film depth and additional meaning.

The pace picks up when Felson meets Bert Gordon (Scott) who is Fats' manager and witnessed the first game between the two. Bert says that Fats was on the hook for the first time in 10 years, but Felson let him off. He calls Felson a born loser, but a loser with talent. He wants to be his manager and demands 75 percent of any winnings. He also issues a warning that Felson could get hurt if he wanders into the wrong pool hall and they realize that he's hustling.

After learning a few life lessons, Felson takes Bert up on his offer. He takes Sarah for a meal and she comments that it's the first time she's seen him wear a tie. It's a sign that he is willing to change. The two go on the road with Bert and Felson plays billiards for big stakes. Billiards isn't his game of choice; he prefers pool. Felson loses initially, but something in his demeanor convinces Bert to continue staking him. He eventually wins enough for another showdown with Fats.

The final 10 minutes of the film show the second game between the two. Felson has changed since the first meeting and life has toughened him up. He's still brash, but won't take a drink while he's playing. I won't reveal who wins, but the film reflects on how we define winning and success in life.

The film has an authentic feel. The pool rooms are dark, seedy and potentially dangerous places. They match the gritty feel of the film. The pool scenes were shot in real pool halls rather than on a set. The only thing that wasn't convincing is the way the actors held a cue in a few shots. A professional player wouldn't have his head so far away from the cue and certainly wouldn't wear a jacket in case it touched another ball and caused a foul shot. But the actors did a good job and both performed most of their shots. The remainder were performed by former billiards world champion Willie Mosconi.

Video Quality 4.5/5
The Hustler looks great in this 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition. There's light grain throughout, but it's never overwhelming. Much of the footage was shot in dark pool halls, but still looks good. The image is clean and free of dirt and print damage. There's plenty of detail and the black and white image matches the mood of the film.

Audio Quality 4/5
The lossless English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix isn't perfect, but offers a considerable upgrade over previous releases. The balls enter the pockets with a resounding thump and the score sounds good. Where it loses a point is in the dialogue as it doesn't sound completely natural. The original mix is also included as well as 5.1 mixes in four other languages.

Special Features 5/5

This package includes a number of features looking back on the film, as well as a couple of segments devoted to Newman's career. They are well worth a look.

The digibook package looks beautiful and the pages contain high quality photographs. The only slight reservation I have is that the disc isn't held in place by a spindle, it just slides into a slot.

The Hustler is a character-driven drama with a strong romantic element. It should appeal to a wide variety of people and is one of Newman's best roles. He's surrounded by a quality supporting cast. If you are a fan of Newman or character pieces in general, this 50th anniversary presentation is an essential purchase.

Bert & Sarah are both fighting for Eddie's (Paul Newman) soul. Bert is tugging on one arm, Sarah the other (metaphorically speaking). Bert convinces Eddie that being a success is most important--which Eddie believes until the end.

But to play them you have to go to special pool rooms and there if you want to play for money you better have your manager. Then you become a hustler and the manager is the pimp. Unprotected you will get your thumbs or your fingers, or your arms, as for that, broken. If protected you better bring in the profit that is expected. But then how can everyone be protected? There must be a loser somewhere to pay for the winners, and then the loser's manager is going to lose money and he will not like that. So they have little arrangements and the loss is shared or the loss is never too much or the loss is that of the stray amateurs of one evening. But when a real good player appears and he wants to win big, he has to have his manager and he has to pay his percentage. But if he is very good he will never understand he must lose from time to time and he will jeopardize the local winner who is the famous chap in these here pool rooms and who knows exactly what to do and who to make lose or win. The young good one who wants to win at any cost and alone will be a danger to the balance of the trade, if not the racket. So he will have to be eliminated. Morally by calling him a loser or by having his own girl friend destroyed in a way or another, it will never succeed. He will even become more aggressive in his winning. Then you have to rig some game to bring him in a corner. He has to be authorized to win much one night in order to bring him either to accepting the authority of his manager and pay his share, or be brutalized into not being able to play again. There are two more solutions but that's the end of the film. Let him go or just plain kill him? In a world that this one a dead body can always be camouflaged. Have a good film. But I find it typical of his time, very early 1960s and it sounds like a sound stage and it is quite slow in rhythm in many ways.

Another small town stop pretending to be salesman with car trouble on their way to a sales award convention so they need to spend a few hours at the local pool hall while their car is being worked on.  They go into their routine to 'setup' the locals for the big hustle and at the end of the day the locals are a few hundred dollars lighter.  The ultimate goal is to 'hustle' the mighty one, Minnesota Fats (Gleason) who hasn't been beaten in 15 years.  The big match lasts 36 grueling hours and several bottles of booze.  The cocky, swaggering Eddie has met his match but it wasn't the pool skills that did him in.  Can he recover or is he the 'born loser' that Bert Gordon (Scott), the 'Fat Man's manager and professional gambler, accuses him of being?  Sarah (Laurie) enters the picture and can two 'born losers'  rehabilitate each other?

Hustler has a great story and theme and wonderful acting. Paul Newman, George C. Scott and Piper Laurie have never been better. Jackie Gleason is suberb in this dramatic role as well. The B&W photorgaphy shot primarily on locations around New York is top notch.

The DVD version is worth it just for the audio commentary alone which includes some of Paul Newman's thoughts. What I really liked about the commentary was Dede Allen's thoughts (editor) and Carol Rossen's (director's daughter) thoughts. Both add so much insight to the making of this great movie. I hope that Carol would consider writing a book about her memories of her dad.

After all these years (movie was released in 1961) it still holds up because its main theme is still so important. How important is winning? What are we willing to give up in order to win? This was not a movie about pool but about life.

598803,5,630321245X,"The Hustler seems underrated. It's not on AFI's Top 100 list, only appearing in its subset of Top 10 sports movies (#6). Evidently it *was* in the larger AFI 400 list that voters received and then pared down. Also I think a generation of moviegoers has only the vaguest conception that Eddie Felson was around before The Color of Money.

Since I happen to think it's a classic of American cinema, I'll spend most of this review addressing some other angles. But I will say in my opinion that this was also Paul Newman's best performance. He is in almost every scene, whereas in Cool Hand Luke there is a larger cast to help pull the weight. George C. Scott is a great villain here, and Jackie Gleason does surprisingly well in an understated role. Why didn't he do more non-comedic roles? And is it really true that Billy Friedkin wanted to cast Gleason as Popeye Doyle in The French Connection (Gene Hackman's famous Oscar-winning role)? Watching the film makes one appreciate good acting. Even the pool shots are real trick shots, no CGI!

It is worth noting the differences between this DVD (the ""Special Edition"" release from 2002, hereinafter referred to as ""SE"") and the more recent ""Two-Disc Collector's Edition"" from 2007 (hereinafter referred to as ""CE""). Yes, ""CE"" has more bonus features--chief among these is an A&E biography of Paul Newman--but are they worth an upgrade if you already own ""SE""? I'm not sure, and I won't be making the investment to find out. After all, ""SE"" already has a running commentary with more than half a dozen people, a documentary, technical insight into the pool mechanics, and more. Plus the quality of the picture/sound is excellent.

One thing that's always bothered me is the airbrushed photo that appears on the back cover of ""SE"". Interestingly, the same travesty appears on the front cover of ""CE"". In both cases we see a classic shot of Newman leaning over the corner of the pool table. In the movie (and the original still photograph), he has a cigarette dangling out of the left corner of his mouth. But Fox airbrushed this out. However, you can still see the *shadow* of the cigarette! In fact, on the back cover of the ""SE"" there is an inset with bonus features, and a screenshot of the DVD menu which features the original (B&W) shot which *does* have the cigarette. Smoking was obviously a common habit in the 50s and 60s, surely even more so in pool halls. Why try to hide that?

Director Robert Rossen named names to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during the Red Scare. It may have gotten his career back on track, but I think it hurt him in other, worse, ways. The Hustler was his next to last film and as one of its main themes is redemption, it is not hard to see Newman/Felson's journey as one Rossen was familiar with. After all, Rossen also produced and co-wrote the screenplay. He died from several illnesses at the age of 57, and I wouldn't be surprised if guilt was one of them.",1252972800,,2964,4.64
598804,4,630321245X,"When I sat down to watch the Hustler I expected it to be a pretty straight forward story of talent and greed, the build up to the match of a lifetime, win or lose, all the tropes that tend to come with a film about talent and obsession.  I was expecting something along the lines of Steve McQueen and the Cincinnati Kid or Charles Bronson in Hard Times, which are both great flicks about gifted men trying to cut out a life in the seedy underbelly of America.  The Hustler parallels both of these flicks, but it seems like there is a lot more to chew on in the story of Paul Newman's Fast Eddie, with his dream to beat the reigning champ of the pool hall, Minnesota Fats, played very restrained by Jackie Gleason.

The Hustler is one of those movie experiences that I tend to cherish.  Often I find that I have a hard time getting into pre-70s films because I lack the experience and frame of reference to appreciate the merits of the filmmaking when I grew up in an era that built on that foundation.  Hazarding a guess, I'd say that one of the merits of a film like the Hustler was its unique narrative flow.  Instead of building to one climax, the plot has a number of peaks and valleys, throwing off the usual expectations and keeping the viewer engaged.  It's also genre blending, not to mention incredibly subtle, even for its slightly hammy dialogue and heartfelt performances.  What ended up hooking me into the story was that there was a thematic through line, Fast Eddie's search for love, that I really wasn't paying attention to, which in my mind has the true build up and climax to the story.  It's not the love of a woman, or really a love of pool, but a love of process and meaning.

There's also an openness for interpretation, for finding allegory and metaphor in the film.  George C. Scott might as well be playing the devil, and it's Fast Eddie's soul in the stakes pile with his match against Minnesota Fats.  But the beauty of this is that it's in the details, and not so heavy handed that it makes the film overbearing or hard to watch.  There's also a very realistic tone to the film.  It's one of the touchstones in that era that illustrates the breaking away from ham-fisted, staged, theatrical filmmaking, to a more honest no holds barred portrayal of life, Cinma vrit, even for being filmed a good seven years before the end of the Hayes code.  I'd suggest the Hustler for anyone who enjoys the early work of Marlon Brando, the films of James Dean and Steve McQueen, or early unconventional filmmaking.",1244851200,,2529,4.467391304347826

Part of the problem is that it follows a formula that has been used by so many movies that it feels rather unoriginal. Fast Eddie Felson is a pool player who wants to play with the best, in this case Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). He plays him in the beginning of the film, loses due to his own deficiencies, meets a mentor, learns how to address his own deficiencies, plays him in the end, and wins. Is that grossly oversimplifying the film? Yes. However, I want to show the formula the movie uses, which is exactly the same as Rounders, The Cincinnatti Kid, The Karate Kid, and others. All those movies came after The Hustler to be sure, but the film's impact (like Hoosiers, to name another beloved sports movie0 is deadened by the fact that it moves along a pre-ordained path.

Now I don't mean to imply that the Hustler is on the same level of filmmaking as Rounders or The Karate Kid. Its focus on character interaction and high level of acting elevate it above such middling genre entries. Fast Eddie's relationship with Sarah is the core of the film, and it's not something we've seen in other movies. On the other hand, his relationship with Bert, professional gambler and criminal, is a little bit harder to swallow. While their initial interactions seem accurate, a scene at the end in which Eddie makes a big speech and shames Bert into relinquishing his share of the money is laughable given Bert's character. More believable is Eddie's relationship with Minnesota Fats, though it's given much less screen time.

All things considered, The Hustler is a decent movie, but it's not nearly as good as I was hoping it would be when I sat down to watch it. If you've seen a lot of movies, you may be disappointed by some of the choices this one makes.",1243296000,,2012,4.506849315068493

598852,4,630321245X,"Paul Newman was a brilliant actor, but even more so than that, he was a brilliant co-star.  I noticed this a while back when watching `Hud' (one of his greatest movies) and how he seemed to draw out the best in everyone on screen.  This is especially noticeable when considering his female co-stars.  Patricia Neal is the best thing about `Hud', hands down.  The same can be said for Elizabeth Taylor in `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' (another flawless movie).  This observation was proved true yet again when watching `The Hustler' and noticing how the impeccably talented Piper Laurie just walked away with every scene.  Her delicate and frayed portrayal of Eddie Felson's doomed love is so magnetic, so genuine and just utterly brilliant.  Newman's undeniable charm and swagger seems to seep into the hearts of his female co-stars, filling them with a life needed to deliver iconic and unforgettable performances.

Neal, Taylor and Laurie should all be considered at the top of any `Greatest Performances of All Time' list for their respective performances.

That said, while I absolutely adore everything about `Hud' and `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof', I don't think I can say the same for `The Hustler'.  When all is said and done, it is a very good movie, but there were times when it just didn't come together for me as tightly and as effectively as I had hoped for, or even expected.  It's hard to really pinpoint the culprit because the two suspects I've singled out (Director Robert Rossen and Screenwriter's Rossen and Sidney Carroll) both deliver some things I've very fond of as well.  In fact, I'm nearly in agreement with their respective Oscar nominations, but parts of both also contain detractors.

My main issues with this film all fall within the first quarter of the film.  It drags out far too long and offers little excitement, even though they are obviously trying to build some tension.  In fact, I wanted to turn the movie off about twenty minutes in, fearing that absolutely nothing could turn this film around for me.  Then the tedious pool scenes ended and Piper Laurie waltzed into the film and everything changed, drastically.  It's within those first twenty or so minutes that most all my complaints lay.  The scenes are too long and too dark.  They don't hold your interest like you'd expect them to.  It's a tricky thing working with a sport that is rather slow and uneventful.  I can't help but call to mind the precision and delicacy that was used in `Casino Royale' though, making a game of poker seem rather exciting.  It can be done well, but here it isn't.  In fact, I didn't find any of the pool scenes to be engaging.

Go figure.

Strip the film of those overly long and overly calculated scenes and you have a near perfect character study thriving with some of the most engaging and beautifully layered performances ever put to film (Newman was a god, really).  The relationships that build between hustler `Fast' Eddie Felson, his alcoholic lover Sarah Packford and his promoter Bert Gordon are all flawlessly crafted and entirely absorbing.  Newman inserts the right amount of over-confidence and insecurities to create a genuinely conflicted individual.  George C. Scott is as heartless as they come, and his sheer severity is commanding to say the least.  Jackie Gleason has a very nice turn here as Minnesota Fats, the pool champion Felson desires to dethrone.  He has such a cool delivery (a far cry the mockery he made of `Smokey and the Bandit') that seems to just slide all over the place.  The real star here though is none other than Piper Laurie (I think I made that clear already).  Her broken and fragile portrayal of Sarah is just heartbreaking.  She truly understands how to seep inside her characters struggles and creates the films moral code despite her characters own moral lapses.

I recommend this film as a beautiful ensemble piece that transcends many other ensembles in actually delivering a slew of brilliantly crafted performances.  As a complete film is it very good but not great.  It falls apart in certain areas, dragging and bogging itself down.  Long strides of poolroom banter and play take away from the film instead of add to it, but when the lights come on and the characters are forced to interact without the distraction of a pool stick they truly come alive, and so does the film.  I'd give it a B-, but the acting is nothing short of an A+.",1228694400,,4410,4.746386333771354

Shot in black and white, it still feels distinctly early 60s, and comes off as a modern tragedy (if not melodrama).  You can feel elements of 50s drama merging with the rough-hewn existentialism of the early 60s, though it's a drama in every sense of the word - nothing twilight zone about this one, except the way characters seem to resemble Rod Serling a little bit in the way they talk.  I didn't realize until the end, Paul Newman's financial banker from the underworld is played by a youthful George C Scott, who does a great job.  Paul himself (as mentioned) sometimes feels a bit over the top, as does his lady love (an interesting character played by Piper Laurie), but in spite of that, the story remains interesting. If nothing else, it has a lot of atmosphere, partially due to being in black and white (the version I saw was in black and white).  I tend to like movies that I've seen from this time period.  There's a feeling of change in the air, an attempt at poetic realism, though with the 'cool' so thick you can cut it with a knife, it may fall short of realistic for a modern audience (of course this was 45 years ago).

Gleason, who shocked the entire country as an excellent, serious actor, plays the highly convincing ""Minnesota Fats"",hanging around,waiting for the next sucker to challenge him. And, in the end everybody loses. Laurie disposes of  herself, Gleason  loses his reputation and his wallet to Newman, Newman loses his girlfriend and his ""right"" to play bigtime pool because Scott has lost his ""cut"" and threatens Newman with massive retaliation. The parties drift away, each probably to his own bar that never closes.",1203465600,2,1242,4.816901408450704

The last scene of the film sums it all up with stark and painful clarity. It is a morality play like no other. In my opinion, ""The Hustler"" is an undeniably brilliant film that reminds me, every time I see it,  that a man should never allow his personal integrity to be ""hustled"" way from him for any amount of fame, money, or glory.

Without integrity, winning means nothing and character cannot be attained. With it, a man or woman ""wins"" no matter what the final score of any game might be.

598982,5,630321245X,"The Hustler is a crucial film in Paul Newman's career. It launched him into the Hollywood stratosphere and marked the beginning of an incredible run in the 1960s, with movies like Hud, Cool Hand Luke and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Newman became a movie star but acted like a character actor, creating one memorable character after another. Arguably, The Hustler is where he really came into his own, delivering a powerful performance as small-time pool hustler Fast Eddie Felson.

The first disc includes an audio commentary by actor Paul Newman, daughter of director Robert Rossen, Carol Rossen, editor Dede Allen, actor Stefan Gierasch (who played Preacher), assistant director Ulu Grosbard, film critic Richard Schickel, and writer/producer Jeff Young. Allen says that they shot and edited the film in New York City which the studio did not like because they wanted to keep closer tabs on the production. Rossen says that before her father optioned the book, Frank Sinatra wanted to adapt it but couldn't figure out a way to do it. Gierasch and Newman talk about how they were cast and recall filming anecdotes. Each participant is interviewed separately and then edited together in this decent track.

""Trick Shot Analysis"" allows you to watch the film with pool expert Mike Massey analyzing five pool sequences or on their own. He tends to describe what we're watching but does explain some of the tactics on display in the movie.

New to this edition are three retrospective featurettes. ""Life in the Fast Lane: Fast Eddie Felson and the Search for Greatness"" includes new interviews with Newman, Laurie, Dede Allen and others. Newman speaks passionately about the film and tells an amusing story about researching his role.

""Milestones in Cinema History: The Hustler"" examines the film's legacy. Newman admired Rossen for allowing them to experiment in the moment. He also recounts a story about how he got hustled by Gleason.

""Swimming with Sharks: The Art of the Hustle"" explores the gambling aspect as well as the con aspect of the film. A pool champ demonstrates some impressive trick shots and defines some key lingo of the sport.

Carried over from the previous DVD edition is ""The Hustler: The Inside Story,"" a retrospective featurette that provides a historical context and how Rossen wanted to comment on society with this film. It also explores the film's origins, casting and various aspects.

""Paul Newman: Hollywood's Cool Hand"" is an A&E biography episode on the actor that examines his life and career with many of his contemporaries talking about him.

""How to Make a Shot"" repeats the ""Trick Shot Analysis"" extra on the first disc.

Also included are trailers for eight of Newman's films and two trailers for The Hustler.

Finally, there is a ""Still Gallery"" with a collection of behind-the-scene photographs, promotional stills and ad campaign material.",1181692800,8,2889,5.088794926004228
598983,4,630321245X,"Paul Newman has been around so long and is so extended as a personality -- we see him most frequently on salad dressing labels -- that there's a danger of forgetting his genius.

Anyone in need of a refresher should cue up for Fox's double-disc rerelease of ""The Hustler."" This was Newman's breakthrough film, a startling piece of lowlife lit built around the fictional pool-shooting punk  Fast Eddy Felson. George C. Scott, Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie turned this 1961 drama into an actors showcase. Every other line found its way into the nation's pool halls and stayed there for decades.

 Robert Rossen directed with style, daring and street smarts, in striking black and white.

This DVD appears to have the same video and audio as the last Fox release, in 2002. No big deal -- there is almost no apparent wear and the widescreen images look handsome overall, a little pale here or murky there. The DVD also ports over the extras from '02, including a group commentary in which Newman participates.

New to the set are three featurettes about the movie, actors and pool shots. Newman is interviewed on camera, sharp but hunched over and hoarsely whispering a lot. The heavy lifting is done by Piper Laurie, who has excellent recall of the New York production. (Newman and Laurie both were in their mid-30s. Rossen called them ""kids."")

Fox deserves credit for upgrading the title at a fair price, but owners of the previous disc probably should wait for rerack on the A/V. There is a fair amount of repetition in the shotgun marriage of old and new extras.",1181520000,4,1565,4.752767527675276
598984,4,630321245X,"Director-scriptwriter Robert Rossen provides a realistic glimpse into the dirty world of the pool hall, and makes it a battleground on which strength and courage are tested...

Fast Eddie is not the traditional, heroic white knight... He's a crafty pool hustler, a man who makes his money by tricking opponents into thinking he's not as good as he really is... But he wants more than cheap hustling--his ambition is to beat the country's top player, Minnesota Fats, and this places him with Newman's other obsessed seekers of grand goals...

Newman really gets inside the character--makes us feel his desperate drive... In the opening scenes, depicting Eddie's marathon match with Fats (Jackie Gleason), he personifies overwhelming confidence, coolness and conceit; as Eddie puts it, he's ""fast and loose."" He grins, moves with assurance around the table, and baits Fats: ""I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about it every night on the road. Five ball. You know, this is my table, man. I own it.""

But there's an underlying insecurity, and a self-destructive tendency... He doesn't know when to stop, and even though he's $18,000 ahead, he won't quit until Fats is demolished... His cockiness leads him to become careless and eventually to fall into a drunken stupor... Fats, in contrast, remains casual and emotionally serene, and he takes all of Eddie's money... As Fats' manager, the crafty, snake-like Gordon (George C. Scott), says, Eddie's ""a loser.""

Eddie's arrogance is unpleasant and his lack of restraint is pathetic, but he's partially redeemed by his affair with Sarah (Piper Laurie), a self-pitying, sore, worn-out alcoholic, whose vulnerability attracts him... It's a splendidly enacted relationship between two derelicts, beginning as a casual pickup and developing into tentative affection... Initially all they do is drink and make love, and, even though Sarah (Piper Laurie) realizes he is not much better than a bum, she (like many women in Newman films) wants more... The turning point occurs when Eddie again loses his restraint and shows off to some men he's hustling, whereupon they break his thumbs... Now, for the first time, he needs Sarah's help, and their relationship deepens as he realizes his dependence upon her...

And she's the only person he can talk to about what most moves him... In a picnic on a hillside--one of the best scenes in Newman's career--Eddie explains that he lost his restraint with the small-time players because he had to show them what pool is like ""when it's really great."" He says that at times he becomes so immersed in pool that his arm and the cue perform as one beautifully functioning organism... This speech is rendered almost poetic by Newman's passionate expression and delivery; together with earlier scenes in which we saw Eddie's movements in the game and his look of admiration at Fats' grace, it convinces us that whether he wins or loses, Eddie is alive only when playing pool...

Sarah is moved to express her love, but the closest he can come is: ""You need the words?"" She does, but he can't say them... And ultimately, whatever love he may feel is overshadowed by the all-consuming need to get back at Fats... He cruelly rejects his fatherly manager (Myron McCormick), who has no such haughty ambitions, and becomes a slave to Gordon, who says he'll always be a loser unless he rids himself of Sarah...

""The Hustler"" is Newman's most balanced characterization--on the one hand, ruthless ambition, arrogant confidence and inability to express love; on the other, vulnerability, recognition of dependence and genuine self-realization--and he brings it all off to perfection... It was his most critically acclaimed performance to that time... The film received nine Oscar nominations, including Newman's second as Best Actor... The award went to the vastly inferior Maximilian Schell (Judgment at Nuremberg), but Newman did win the British Academy Award...",1167609600,4,3940,5.146875

But an unanticipated life lesson is required before graduation.

Admittedly mild by today's standards, THE HUSTLER is nevertheless replete with depraved moral issues and vices. Gambling, drunkenness, brutality, sex, and death are more than subtly implied -- all taking this beyond family viewing category despite the lack of movie rating.

This ten-time Oscar nominated drama is absolutely mesmerizing. Newman, Gleason, George C. Scott, Piper Laurie, Michael Constantine all turn in remarkable performances. Viewers don't just watch this movie, they experience compassion, pity, shame, and disgust for its characters by becoming students of the pool game and of life.

But Eddie can't reach glory only supported by his narrowminded, short sight and modest financial mate, superbly played by Myron McCormick, for me the most credible personage.  And so, only three people understands Eddie: one is Sarah, a tormented lonely girl without love. The other is Bert Gordon, the professional manager, a destructive businessman: he owns money, but wishes more than only that, and envies the ability of talented persons. Sarah, so, has the intuition Bert likes to destroy the lives of people which has capacities he's unable to reach.  The third person and a good man is paradoxically, Minnesota Fats: he's the most hard adversary for Eddie, but a loyal one, not an enemy, although he evidently works for  to whom he has sold his dexterity as billiard gambler.

Second: the admirable script with abundant material, discursive and metaphoric, supported by exceptional sequences and smart dialogues; and third, the towering performance of Paul Newman, who made to my mind his crowned acting ever.

599043,5,630321245X,"""Fast"" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a talented but cocky hustler who wants to make it to the big time by defeating the reigning king of the pool hall - Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). Eddie starts off by winning a substantial amount of money. But instead of quitting while he's ahead, he allows himself to be defeated by his own arrogance and self-destructive qualities. While ""down and out"" he finds an intelligent but alcoholic girlfriend named Sarah (Piper Laurie). Sarah and Eddie start off as two ""born losers"" who make a ""contract of depravity"" together. But Sarah eventually falls in love, seemingly finding a new purpose in her life while helping Eddie recover from an injury. Eddie also has feelings for her. But he seems reluctant to make a commitment and still feels he must go back and defeat Minnesota Fats before he can achieve self-fulfillment. Eddie, trapped by circumstances, eventually signs up with an utterly cynical and manipulative ""manager,"" Bert Gordan (George C. Scott), who agrees to front Eddie stakes money in exchange for a 75% cut of his winnings. Bert and Sarah wage a battle over Eddie. But Sarah, deciding she has no chance against Bert, ends up committing suicide. It is this tragic loss which finally causes Eddie to realize what is truly important in life. He then returns to the Ames pool hall and, with a new found sense of character to match his talent, defeats Minnesota Fats. But, perhaps most importantly, he then decides to take his winnings and leave the pool world rather than allowing Bert to once again establish control over him.

""The Hustler"" has top notch acting, beautiful cinematography and a jazz soundtrack that matches perfectly with the mood of the film. But what makes ""The Hustler"" one of the all time classic movies is that it is about so much more than just pool. It is really about success in life and what makes a person a true ""winner"" or ""loser"". Eddie has talent but not the inner strength that will allow him to be the best. Similarily, Sarah is a gifted writer but is plauged by her own inner demons from reaching her potential. In contrast, Bert is rotten to the core. He lacks any talent except the ability to prey on the weaknesses of others for his own personal gain.

Another great strength of this film is that the characters are so multi-dimensional and complex. Also the movie has a sense of ambiguity and irony to it, as the characters are faced with difficult decisions and no easy answers. For example, Sarah rightfully calls Eddie a bum for doing nothing but wallowing in self-pity and mooching off of her. But when Eddie attempts to take action by returning to the pool world they become even more estranged and Sarah ends up killing herself. Then, from this tragedy, Eddie finally is able to overcome his weakness and find the character necessary to not only defeat Fats but to become a true winner in life.",1132704000,,2891,4.734126984126984

The showdown between cocky pool shark ""Fast Eddie"" Felsen(Paul Newman) and the more assured ""Minnesota Fats""(Jackie Gleason).  Newman is mesmerizing as he makes shot after shot berating his opponent in an attempt to psyche him out.  It seems to me that the character of Fats and Gleason are somewhat intertwined because Gleason was a pool player of some renown.  Nonetheless, Gleason is nothing short of charismatic as he dangles a cigarette from his mouth precisely going about the business at hand while ignoring the childish invective Felsen directs at him.  Director Robert Rossen doesn't just concern himself with pool.  ""The Hustler"" is also a character study as the film follows Eddie after this match on a journey of self-discovery.  Along the way he developes a relationship with a fragile alcoholic woman, Sarah(Piper Laurie)that is treated tenderly but realistically by Rossen.  Eddie takes on a no-nonsense manager Bert(George C. Scott) who may know the game but has the scruples of a snake.  Everything comes full circle leading to a rematch with Fats with Eddie being a changed person.  All the elements click in this film from the sets that contain the smoky poolhalls, the gorgeous black-and-white photography, and the jazzy score.  At it's core ""The Hustler"" is a film about a man's personal maturation with pool being the milieu in which that occurs.",1104537600,2,1447,5.141025641025641
599137,5,630321245X,"This movie is one of the great movies to come out the the 1960's (and there was plenty of competition in that decade).  It stars Paul Newman in arguably his best role of his career.  In fact, he later won his lone Oscar for continuing that same role as a mature ""Fast Eddie"" Felsen in ""The Color of Money"".

It is a story of a small time pool hustler who feels it's time for the big leagues.  He tries to take on the best; Minnesota Fats (played by The Great One, Jackie Gleason).  That match up was awesomely put together on the screen.  Fast Eddie learns a few things in that encounter and his confidence is shaken.  He has to regroup and finds himself sinking into a self-defeating relationship with a an underworld type played by George C. Scott.  His girl friend, played by Piper Laurie, ultimately causes him to confront his loss of self-respect and he begins to turn his life around.  His rebound allows the movie to surge to an uplifting ending.

Anyone who ever won a local pool tournament will love this movie.  The scenes in the pool hall bring out the skill, the stress, the finesse, the banter, and the betting in a supurb manner.  This is a film about self-respect and personal values.  Fast Eddie sold himself to the devil to become a winner.  Once he realized what he was sacrificing to win, he turned his life around.  With his renewed sense of purpose and self-respect, winning on his own terms became a reality.

The acting in this movie is outstanding.  All four of the main actors, Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie, received Oscar nominations.  Paul Newman starts out impetuous and eventually shows the deep inner strength he has discovered.  Jackie Gleason is Mr. Cool with a pool stick.  Many would argue that his is the premier preformance in the movie.  George C. Scott is devious and calculating.  Piper Laurie plays a character who seems to have trouble finding what she wants but eventually discovers what she doesn't want.  The directing and writing are supurb.

Our cast of characters lives and breathes pool. They wallow in the mire of the losing end of a hustle and bask in the reflected glory to be had when feeling full of grace and cash when the balls fall their way. Allow me to entreat your entrance into such a world, to let you feel the skin of the score, feel the heat, feel the agony and feel the cue stick as it is thrust for the kill.

Eddie Felson, or 'Fast Eddie' as he is known (Paul Newman), always looking for action, crisscrosses the country with his partner, Charlie Burns (Myron McCormick). Their goal is to locate the requisite game that consists of bangers or fish, those who lack the skill to really play the game and will eventually wind up as requisite losers to the hustling pool shark. Their bait and switch techniques lead them to a session with legendary pool player, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). Felson proceeds to bark and freeze out Fats into a 24 hour non-stop marathon of fast breaking, free wheeling and dogged shots that culminate in Felson losing all that he had won, $18,000, due to a bad lack of judgment, tiredness, choking and basically being drunk. Felson proceeds, against better judgment, to lose Burns and go it alone. Because he is naive enough to believe that he is 'the best', he begins walking a path down a dark and winding road that will end with him discovering who he really is and what is and isn't important in his life.

The second act provides the romantic relief given by Piper Laurie as the doomed Sarah Packard, filled with her own demons and willing to latch onto what she considers a reality in the guise of Felson. Not content to leave well enough alone, Felson feeling the heat of a projected rematch with Minnesota Fats, sells his soul to the devil, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), a professional gambler or 'patron' who pimps his way and jelly rolls by absconding with a gargantuan cut won by any member of his stable, silly or crazy enough to agree to his terms. Bert will finance Felson, and parlay his skills to games of his choosing, so that the latter can get the money he feels is necessary to get the desired rematch with Fats.

The performance of Paul Newman is hot, electric, hissing and sizzle. His emotions are worn on his sleeve, and the raw venue of the outpouring of his addiction to the game, his shy handling of romance with Laurie and the vitality and cockiness portrayed in his moments with Gleason at the pool table, are priceless vignettes encapsulated within the confines of a beginning and end to this story. Felson has the stone cold nuts buried within himself, and his rematch at the end of the film is brutal and coarse; in keeping with the black and white magic that projects itself as a web that weaves itself around us, drawing us ever closer to the crux of the matter.

Gleason is cool and calm. The rarified dandy that allows his reputation as the best to bulge ahead of him, to shark the short stop, fool enough to think he can take him on. The detachment, the demeanor, the noblesse oblige all gravitate to him, making him a legend in his own time and tournament tough. Gleason proves that besides being the comedic actor so many of us are familiar with, that there was a dramatic actor biting at the bit to prove his mettle.

George C. Scott, the Stake Horse, is miry, looking for that shark who will eat the food chain of fish, minnows, guppies and algae that embroider themselves as alleged experts of the game. He's a lockout artist and wears the outfit like a custom tailored suit. His performance as road agent, like that of McCormick, is a study in contrasts and shadows. Scott burrows under the skin and elicits not an iota of sympathy for his character, for he is a survivor, with a heart that is pure granite and will always find a means to an end, come hell or high water.

Piper Laurie as the alcoholic cripple, Sarah Packard, is acting fulfillment. Her Sarah is quiet and sad; a harbinger of a life lived amid endless rejections and mind numbing relationships that have always faltered; being cast aside until another, eligible suitor or solution makes its acquaintance with her and the cycle begins anew. Hers is a trilogy of a downward spiral. The relationship with Felson, clinging to the life preserver that she thinks him to be; the all too knowing summation of her opinion of Gordon and her eventual, ill fated ending are almost Shakespearean in their scope and pacing.

The direction by Robert Rossen, based on the novel by Walter Tevis (Tevis also wrote the screenplay for this and The Color of Money, another of his novels), is taut and tense in the workings of the pool world and the inhabitants that make it a place of 'the best' or 'yesterday's news'. He elicits performances from his cast that are signatures of the talents that all would keep as constant companions throughout their illustrious careers. He has a complete understanding of the tense, time clock precision required to bring the sport of pool to the everyday Joe who watches this film.

The black and white cinematography by Eugene Shufften is marvelously complex, plying the viewer to look into the cracks and crevices that cement another facet in this moment of time. Black and white films are today, looked upon as a dinosaur, an anachronism that has become as outdated as the turbulent 60's, disco or the last favourites column that ends with each year before the new one comes upon us. If given half a chance, the inner workings of the mysterious power it uses to draw us closer into a story would become all so apparent to us. Those of us who truly love movies already know the secret.

The Set Direction by Harry Horner and Gene Callahan permits no substitute to the throne of pretense or false deceptions. Grime, sweat, smoke, drink, grease, moments in time living in the past, swirling into a maelstrom and regurgitated out for our perusal -- this was and is the low life of a pool hall. It's the world of pool as seen away from the niceties of the manicured world of competition as it is presented today.

Kenyon Hopkins music has a cool, jazz feel to it; laid back and gleaned as smooth and neat as a bourbon on the rocks. There is no garnishment, no sweetness, no syrup to congeal; just a calculated, simple drawing upon minimalist themes, as jazz is won't to be.

The Hustler is one of the best 'sport' movies ever. The dialogue, the performances, the even handling of all concerned, have presented us with a film that had that feel of lives lived within the confines of an aquarium of restrictions that has burst from the netherworld of backstreet pool. The Color of Money pales in comparison to this film. The Oscar was awarded to Newman (playing the same character for the latter), but I consider it as a compensation for his real work in The Hustler, a much better conceived film. He stayed in the stall for The Color of Money. Do yourself a favour and become a voyeur, sweating the action of The Hustler. It's an 'A' Game",1092441600,2,7326,4.5754573170731705
599139,5,630321245X,"With or without the Oscar, this is one of the greatest American films ever made in any genre.  George C. Scott refused to take part in the Oscar ceremonies when ""The Hustler"" was nominated, calling them ""a self-serving orgy"" if my memory serves me right.  Perhaps that stand contributed to the movie not being recognized in its own time.  Whatever the reason, this film shows you that recognition is unnecessary for true art.  The cream always rises to the top.
People may not realize that Paul Newman was an unknown when this movie was made.  His youthful brashness and emotion laden performance show him as an actor beyond his years.
One can never say too much about George C. Scott.  He's old reliable, in this movie as in his others.  He does an excellent job.  He's just so good that we are numb to his mastery.
Piper Laurie also turns in an amazing performance.  Her acting is subtle but her method is steady.
The real standout in this film is Jackie Gleason.  He shows why he was called ""The Great One.""  I personally feel that this movie shows him as the greatest method actor of his generation, and perhaps one of the greatest ever.
But unbelievable acting is only one part of this gem.  The cinematography is clear and artistic.  The script is expertly written and the scenery couldn't be more authentic.
This is the only pool movie I know of that you can enjoy as a pool player.  The pool scenes are unbelievable.  They used the greatest pool players of the day in shooting and it shows.  The Color of Money is a nicely shot movie but there is not really a lot of pool in it.  This is a pool movie that transcends pool.
Please do yourself a favor and add this to your collection.",1083196800,11,1690,4.452768729641694

However, Eddie is young and boastful with poor self-control and after several drinks he loses a very large amount of money to Minnesota Fats in a lengthy pool game.  Penniless and embarrassed Eddie runs off like a dog with his tail between his legs from his manager and friend. As Eddie leaves he meets Sarah (Piper Laurie) with whom he begins to form a relationship with.  As Eddie then attempts to rebound from his financial set back he meets Bert Gordon, a ruthless and wealthy gambler.  Gordon offers Eddie a tough deal, but it might be a new beginning for Eddie depending on what price he might have to pay in order to get back on his feet.  Hustler is a remarkable film about self-discovery, greed, love, and billiards that captivates the audience through an intriguing story.  The story's genuine feeling of how people struggle through difficulties is brought out by a terrific cast as well as cinematography that lends support to the emotions that the characters feel.

599142,4,630321245X,"A very impressive movie with great characterizations and wonderful performances. Highly recommended.
The DVD:
Picture and sound are perfect. The menu is nicely done, with animated stills from the movie. The comments by Mike Massey and the display of shots from the film are somewhat interesting but you can't really call it an explanation of the shots. Various camera perspectives or slow motion would have been more helpful. The trailers are interesting, the picture gallery is very very short. The featurette gives some insights, but doesn't go very deep.
Now the main criticism, the (as it says on the box) ""Various audio commentaries"": You can't do audio commentaries worse. An interviewer asks one of the commentators a question, eg What was your impression of Robert Rossen? or How was it working with ...? After the question has been answered by that person, the next one is asked the same question. This becomes boring pretty fast, especially because some of the answers are not worth to listen to. Stefan Gierasch, Richard Schickel and Jeff Young give only short statements, making you wonder why they're there anyway. Carol Rossen tells some interesting stories, but you get the impression she has a very subjective point of view that doesn't tell everything. Ulu Grosbard delivers a lot of informations. Paul Newman is the biggest disappointment, because he is rarely asked and all in all says about 10 sentences. This is beaten by Dede Allen, the editor, who most of the time ignores the questions and starts to tell all kinds of stories about herself and her experiences in the movie and editing business. This is definitely the best and most interesting part of the commentary, if you're interested in insider stories about movie making and editing. The bad thing about the commentary is that it never relates to the movie which is running in the background. The commentators don't commentate because they don't see the film. They're simply answering questions, which definitely is not the purpose of such a commentary. You have to ask yourself if complete interviews with the persons would not have been better (since they're obviously done as interviews and are also part of comments in the featurette).
In the end you get to know some facts about the movie, basically nothing about Robert Rossen and a lot about Dede Allen. This could have been really better.",1061596800,6,2376,5.002525252525253
599143,5,630321245X,"By the time Paul Newman played Fast Eddie Felson in THE HUSTLER, he had already established himself as Hollywood's most enduring icon of the anti-establishment rebel.  It was almost a given that director Robert Rossen would tap him for the lead role based on the novel by Walter Tevis.  For any male who has spent much of a misspent life in a pool hall, the look and feel of the felt table ambiance rings true.  In addition to a crackling good story of a young man wishing to unseat the local champ, there is a running subtext of how some people recognize their limitations and can pay a heavy price to overcome them.
Newman invests his Felson persona with alternating crescendos of charm, punk-alley rage, and grittiness.  Felson and his partner Charley (Myron McCormick) hustle pool players for chump change.  A few hundred here, a few bucks there, and Charley is satisfied.  But not Eddie.  Although no one on screen has told him, ""You're good, real good, but not so good as The Fat Man,"" Felson makes it clear that his ego requires that he himself must be the best.  It is this drive for a supremacy that Steve McQueen would later follow in THE CINCINATTI KID that introduces the theme that to be the best requires more than raw talent at pool.  Fast Eddie has the talent, but in his drive to be the top, he sends out mixed signals that he has the discipline too. Minnesota Fats, the long-reigning champion, has plenty of both.  Jackie Gleason as Fats is exactly right as the champion who knows that even for such a winner as himself, he still understands the power politics of who pushes the buttons to stage manage each bout for felt table supremacy.  The power behind Fats' throne is Bert Gordon, a gambling entrepeneur who rigs each contest so that for him it is not gambling at all.  George Scott as Gordon knows every player who can help or hurt him.  Regardless of the outcome of any match, he will always take his cut.  Many of the finest scenes of THE HUSTLER have nothing to do with pool, although nearly all of them occur in the dimly lit grunge of seedy pool halls.  These scenes examine an inverted father-son clash of egos with Gordon as the vicious sadist father who seeks to browbeat his wayward son and Fats as the sympathetic yet lethal opponent who both understands the demons that drives Felson and exudes emotional support at crucial moments.  And then there is Sarah Packard, an alcoholic student/writer who sees in Felson the deeply buried winner that she is sure is there.  Piper Laurie as Sarah is perhaps the most complex of the trio who impact on Felson.  She nurtures him through his and her own crises, all the while knowing that for him to be the winner he can be, she must pay the price that will validate in his own ideas the belief that he is not the loser that Bert Gordon often accuses him of being.
THE HUSTLER is probably one of the best two or three films of the sixties in that it explores what it is like to reach for that which may be beyond one's grasp.  The interplay between those who seek to erode Felson's confidence and those who seek to enhance it suggest that the ability to adapt to changing psychological environments is the key for success.  The price as he learns, is that others may have to pay that price for him. THE HUSTLER emphasizes this point better than any other film of that decade--or any for that matter.",1060473600,2,3373,4.498360655737705

599240,5,630321245X,"I used to watch this movie when I was a teenager with some friends of mine.  We shot pool all of the time and would watch this movie and/or the Color of Money before hopping in someone's car and going to a pool tournament.  Our favorite parts of the movie were the two acts in which Minnesota Fats(Jackie Gleason) and Fast Eddie(Paul Newman) played each other.  About once a month I still manage to stop in a gritty pool hall, not much different than the one depicted in the movie.  The same type of people you see hanging around these pool rooms hang around in the ones in this movie.
I've grown up now, and can see that there is a lot more than pool shots going on in this movie.  The DVD has a commentary track, in which the director's daughter says that the movie is about what it means to become a success in America - what you have to do to become one and what comes with success.  This was the first movie the director compelted after he gave up the names of innocent people to the McCarthy Communist witch-hut committees.  Who knows how that experience effected him - but I'm sure in someway that it carried over into this masterpiece.  I'm sure there's more Minnesota Fats in him than Eddie Felson - but that's what it takes to make a Hollywood movie.
Although Paul Newman is the main character in this movie and the story revolves around him - the story isn't complete without the other characters.  You have Burt Gordon(George C. Scott) who is the complete capitalist.  He is a hustler - someone who has bucked the system and made a lot of money quickly.  An outlaw in a way.  Made money gambling and knowing what other people will do.  However, all he cares about is making more money and he destroys people who are in his way or who may show him a better one.
You have Minnesota Fats(Jackie Gleason) - the greatest pool player on earth.  The perfect artist or the perfect athlete.  He shoots pool like a machine, but seems to do it with no joy.  He's just a robot.  He works for Burt Gordon.  No.  He is owned by Burt Gordon.  Somewhere along the line he sold out to him.  Although he is the best at pool, he is not his own man and one feels sorry for him at the end of the movie.
You have the Piper Laurie character.  The needy co-dependent who has demons in her past that aren't totally explained in the movie, but don't need to be, because everyone knows someone with demons, if they don't have some of their own.  She understands what is going on around her.
Fast Eddie - the man who loves to shoot pool for the sake of shooting pool, but eventually comes to see that unbridled ambition isn't worth fulfilling, because of the sacrifices that it demands.  He gets ""character"" and walks away a free man.
This is a great movie.  Won several Academy Awards and is probably one of the top 100 American movies ever made. That's all you need to know.",1047427200,3,2860,4.320825515947467

I've been a huge fan of this film since I first saw it and was excited to hear what this interesting mix of commentators - director Robert Rossen's daughter, Carol Rossen, Paul Newman, Richard Schickel, cast member Ulu Grosbard and Dede Allen - had to say. Unfortunately, after a few minutes of commentary dialog, I quickly realized that none of these people were actually watching the film! While interesting at times, their comments basically amounted to an oral history of the movie and the film climate during the time The Hustler was produced. Some of the reminiscing is definitely interesting, particularly how Newman came into the film. But nobody actually says anything about a scene as it is being shown. Even more annoying was the realization that this was really just an extension of the interviews done for the documentary also included on the DVD (and why is Newman absent from that but not the commentary?), so in some cases you hear extended takes of the same dialog. The overall effect was like having someone sit behind you in a movie theater and share thoughts and anecdotes from the film but paying zero attention to anything transpiring on the screen. Most annoying was Carol Rossen - whose involvement in this project is already in question. But hearing her speak, you get the impression she directed it herself. From the opening, Rossen blathers on endlessly about everything from Hollywood blacklisting to whether or not she would have been appropriate for the Piper Laurie role. Perhaps interesting on some levels, but does this really work as movie commentary? I don't think so, and to pass this off as such is misleading. For example, in the opening, Carol shares her perspective on the film - how the atmosphere in the pool rooms was very corporate with men dressed in suits, etc. ""Nobody smokes, nobody drinks,"" she says at one point, just as Paul Newman enters a poolroom and lights up! From that point on, one cannot help but notice how nearly EVERYONE in this film smokes and drinks, which is no surprise since that was part of the pool-hall atmosphere from that time. At another point, everyone is reminiscing about Piper Laurie, while the great George C. Scott becomes a bigger part of the story, playing Bert Gordon. You almost feel like yelling at the screen ""hey, anybody notice George C. Scott???"" Rather than waiting to see if anyone had any comments about him, I finally gave up.
Commentary aside, The Hustler is a great film and this DVD goes a long way toward giving it the treatment it deserves. The menus and extras on pool playing and trick shots are wonderful.

599245,5,630321245X,"""The Hustler"" is a classic, and one of my favorite movies.  It is the story of Fast Eddie Felson, who starts out a ""boy"" and becomes a man.  Paul Newman plays Fast Eddie.  He is a pool hustler, and a very good one.  At the start of the movie he wants to play Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), who is the best pool player in the country.  Fats is polished and full of character; Fast Eddie is arrogant and overly confident.  After they play, Fast Eddie meets Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie).  They both are in need of someone, and the two begin to care for each other.  Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) offers to be Fast Eddie's stake horse, and he puts up money and sets up matches for Fast Eddie to play.  Bert sees Sarah  (and Fast Eddie, for that matter) as someone to manipulate, but he underestimates her.  Ultimately, their interaction leads Fast Eddie to redefine himself.
The entire cast is fantastic.  Paul Newman as Fast Eddie brings a great deal of depth and passion to his role.  He believably transforms Fast Eddie to a mature man with poise and character.  He showed similar passion in other movies, like ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"".  George C. Scott, who is early in his career, plays Bert, a man who manipulates others to serve himself.  His character is not likeable, but one respects the confidence he has in himself.  Piper Laurie plays a wounded character with subtle effectiveness.  Jackie Gleason is excellent as Minnesota Fats, a man who appears self-assured, with a commanding presence.
""The Hustler"" was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including: Best Actor (Paul Newman - his second nomination), Best Actress (Piper Laurie), Best Supporting Actor (Jackie Gleason), and Best Supporting Actor (George C.

599338,5,630321245X,"The Hustler spotlights one of Paul Newman's finest performances in his portrayal of  Fast Eddie Felson, an arrogant, amoral pool hustler who's determined to be the greatest pool player in the country by beating the legendary Minnesota Fats (played flawlessly by Jackie Gleason).
The film is a gritty, uncompromising character study and tragic love story that is set in the world of pool hustlers. Piper Laurie; as an alcoholic floozy who falls hard for Fast Eddie; and George C. Scott as the cold hearted manipulative gambler, Bert Gordon,-- contribute two additional flawless supporting performances. It was directed by the controversial Robert (All the King's Men) Rossen (he resisted but eventually named names during the infamous blacklist of the 50's).
The film focuses on the arrogant, unsympathetic exploits of a con man as he uses his charm, looks and pool playing skills to hustle enough money to challenge Minnesota Fats, only to be humiliated in defeat.  As 'Fast Eddie' attempts to raise money for a re-match, he meets and almost falls in love with Sarah a fellow alcoholic.  At first Fast Eddie refuses to be managed by Bert Gordon, but after a pool hall hustle ends up with Fast Eddie having his thumbs broken, he reconsiders. Before the re-match with Minnesota Fats, a warm up high stakes game in Louisville has tragic consequences.
The film dares to focus on a-typical anti-hero characters who live by amoral codes.  Very little Hollywood style gloss is to be found anywhere in this stylistic gritty masterpiece which wound up being nominated for 10 Academy Awards (West Side Story won most of them that year). Cinematographer Eugene Shufftan deservedly won an Oscar for his moodily lit, beautiful black and white images. Harry Horner's and Gene Callahan's intricately art direction, production design and set decoration were also awarded with Oscars. Pool legend Willie Mosconi taught Newman how to look and act the part of a pool hustler and also made Newman's trick shots in the film.  Jackie Gleason was already an excellent pool player.  There really was an Aames pool hall in New York City and it is used for the film's most riveting scenes.  Boxer Jake LaMotta (of 'Raging Bull' fame) plays a bartender in the film.
Director Rossen who began his career as a screenwriter made only one other film (1964's Lilith) after 'The Hustler'. Rossen died in 1966.  Martin Scorcese directed the 1986 sequel Color of Money, with Newman reprising his Fast Eddie role (and this time Newman won a best Actor Oscar for his efforts) as he teaches an up and coming hustler (Tom Cruise) the ropes.  The sequel doesn't come close to being as good as the original (despite its stylistic flourishes, cast and director).
Interesting to note that the characters in The Hustler were fictitious and an above average pool player legally changed his name to Minnesota Fats AFTER the film was released.  The real life 'Minnesota Fats' eventually played a nationally televised (hosted by Howard Cosell) pool exhibition with William Mosconi in the 1970's more than 10 years after this 1961 film.
DVD IMAGE AND SOUND
The film has been digitally re-mastered in  2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The films  looks to be in excellent shape with very little print damage observed.  The look of the film is smoky and gritty and the shadow details are rich indicating strong black levels present. This is a very sharp looking black and white film.  The sound will not impress but the dialogue, sound effects and occasional music is crisp and usually centered..

DVD EXTRA'S
In addition to two trailers for the film, there are a few interesting featurettes  some production stills and the superb commentary track.
Richard Schickel hosts the too short documentary The Hustler: The Inside Story which gives us some details on how the film came to be made, and delivers some we were there stories from some of the film-makers and a few surprise guests.
 ""How to Make the Shot,"" and ""Trick Shot Analysis by World Artistic Champion, Mike Massey""
are two shorts demonstrating and showing viewers how to make some trick shots on the pool table.
There is a superb commentary track which features the reminisces, and perspectives from actors:  Paul Newman, and Stefan Gierash (Preacher),  Dede Allen (film editor), Ulu  Grosbard (assistant director), Carol Rossen (the director's daughter), Richard Schickel (film critic, Time), and Jeff Young (film historian).  The comments cover all aspects of the making of the film.  Newman's comments as one might expect are few.
The film looks and sounds great, the extras compliment the classic film  very well.  Along with Hud, and Nobody's Fool, The Hustler has,  what for me, is one of the three best Newman performances on film.  Considering the supporting cast are superb, there's little for anyone to fault with this film.
Christopher  J. Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder a critically acclaimed, steamy suspense thriller...",1025740800,95,4974,5.04029304029304
599339,5,630321245X,"Tension in American movies has changed in the way it is created.
Currently, unrelenting action  accompanied by loud music is the norm for creating tension, i.e., most of  Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the entire Mission Impossible 2.
The evolution into non-stop tension producing action accompanied by loud music has been gradual. The small action scenes became highpoints of those early significant movies, i.e., the chase scene in Bullitt,  and the chase scene in the French Connection.
None of this applies to The Hustler.  Tension is produced by silences. And by darkness.
Watch this movie again and count the times when nobody speaks. Notice that there is a two minute period of tension producing silence when Newman and Gleason shoot pool.. The lighting is dark  Or perhaps the darkness is light enough to see in.
When the window shade is pulled open and the sunlight floods the pool hall, Jackie Gleason shouts to get rid of the sunlight. The shade goes back up, Darkness resumes its reign.
The tension becomes so thick you can cut it with the proverbial knife.
In the apartment, when Paul Newman opens the shutters in Piper Laurie's bedroom, sunlight floods the room. They look outside. There are people standing. There are people talking. Newman and Laurie are relaxed. They talk.
In this movie, whenever the scene is well lit,  the people are relaxed and enjoying themselves. George C. Scorr is relaxed and drinking at the big party.
This is a great movie. It is worth studying once a year.
There are no chase scenes. There is no music. And there are those words not spoken. There are so many words not spoken. There are those people not talking.
But everyone is communicating. Do not mistake those silences in black and white for dead  moments. The actors are communicating with their eyes, their stances, their  gestures, their body language..
This is a great movie. It is the required text on the study of  creating tension in early  American movies.",1024790400,,1962,4.847305389221557
599340,5,630321245X,"Paul Newman as Fast Eddie Felson will bring tears to your eyes and make you question your values, the depth of your life, and the extent of your love.
The movie is more than just a story of a man, it is a poem about success and the payments we make in matters of the heart to achieve our goals in life.  Filmed in black and white, it elicits a nostalgia for days past and sets the perfect tone for the noir-like telling of Fast Eddie's lesson in character.
Jackie Gleason, as the fictional Minnesota Fats, is the sad grandfather we all wish that we could cheer up...going through the routines of life and relishing in the simplicity of rote actions.  For him, the pool hall is a cathedral, and the table is the place where he recites his rosary...more out of habit than out of love.
For Fast Eddie (Newman), the pool hall is his local bar, an addiction that fuels his passionless life, the Holy Grail that is just beyond his reach.  It promises greatness that he secretly fears he is incapable of grasping.  Like a drunk who promises to drink you under the table, his pride pushes him to lose again and again.
The supporting cast is impeccable.  Piper Laurie is so heartbreakingly beautiful and torn that you wish you could hold her and tell her the things that Fast Eddie never will.
Watch this movie alone, and then call your loved ones after the credits...it's one of the few movies that truly affects your soul.",1023148800,7,1415,4.447876447876448

599342,5,630321245X,"Nothing more to say about this movie except that it is, in my opinion, of the greatest American movies made.  I was not even a Paull Newman fan until I first watched this movie.  One of the finest character developments unfolds as Eddy begins to question what makes life worth living.  The conflict between him and George C. Scott allows everyone to really question what exactly a ""winner"" is.  Further conflicts arise with his newly found, fellow alcoholic girlfriend as he struggles to decide exactly what their relationship means to him.  With incredibly deep characters and subtle illustrations of what's in Eddy's mind, te movie really gets at the question, ""What makes life worth living?""  Plus, the pool action is really incredible with some very skilled shots, so if you're a pool fan, it's just another added bonus.  I truly believe this is one of the most well made movies out there and Paul Newman's best work.",1018828800,5,921,4.828025477707007

I can understand not dubbing a film - that's expensive. But how much can it cost to add subtitles? I know it can't be too much.

599344,5,630321245X,"The Hustler is loaded with great performances by Piper Laurie, George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason, among others. However, Paul Newman, in one of his greatest performances (his breakout), is the nerve center of the film. He somehow manages to be both cocky and vulnerable at the same time. I've always admired Newman (and his Butch Cassidy partner Robert Redford, for that matter) for not relying on his looks, for his willingness to play flawed characters, and for using his star power to make quality films that have something to say. His ""Fast Eddie"" Felson in The Hustler is a prime example. Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) has Eddie pegged when he calls him a ""loser."" Although talented, Eddie is a pawn of unscrupulous people who use him to satisfy their own greed. He treats Sarah (Piper Laurie), the only person who really cares about him like dirt. SPOILER ALERT: In the end, he loses Sarah and is blackballed from playing pool forever. It's a masterful performance by Newman and a credit to his artistic integrity that he was willing to play such a loser.

However, Newman somehow lost the 1961 Best Actor Oscar to Maximillian Schell for Judgment at Nuremberg. Schell is a terrific actor and ""Judgment"" was a wonderful film, but his performance was clearly a supporting role. Newman, in contrast, is in almost every scene of The Hustler. If someone from Judgment at Nurember deserved the Best Actor Oscar, it was Spencer Tracy who was the lead. It's bad enough that Paul Newman lost the Oscar, but to do so to a performance that was really a supporting role is ridiculous. The Oscar is an award that rightfully carries a lot of prestige. In 1961, however, the Academy tainted that prestige by denying Paul Newman of an award that he richly deserved. Newman was criticized when he did not attend the 1986 Oscar ceremony to accept his award for his reprise of Eddie Felson in The Color of Money. When you realize how badly he was snubbed in 1961, you can understand why he passed on the ceremony in 1986.",1016755200,11,2009,4.691218130311615
599345,5,630321245X,"Robert Rossen's THE HUSTLER (1961) is one of the great memorable films of the sixties.  Although I am inclined to say that HUD (1963) and COOL HAND LUKE (1967) are Paul Newman's best films, this movie gets a very close third place. All of these movies have Newman playing born losers who won't conform to the rules of life. This film isn't just about Newman's character, pool hustler Eddie Felson, but about those in his orbit - his girlfriend (Piper Laurie), manager (Myron McCormick), Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) - the manipulative agent, and even Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).
There is one thing that is on Eddie Felson's mind  - to beat legendary Minnesota Fats at pool. He not only wants to beat Fats for the money, but he wants to build a name for himself. Felson almost beats Fats in their first match, but he doesn't know when to quit. Felson blows it through pride and booze. According to Bert Gordon, Felson is a born loser. Gordon summarizes Felson's major weakness - lack of character. Then, Felson ruthlessly dumps his manager Charlie Burns (McCormick), and he finds solace in the arms of an alcoholic loner Sarah Packard (Laurie). They develop a destructive love affair. Unfortunately, this is when the movie goes flat - too much emphasis on Newman and Laurie. Felson tries a comeback, and with the financial help of Gordon, he does face Fats again. However, Felson pays a horrible sacrifice for this last match.
The film received two Oscars for black-and-white set design and cinematography. It also garnered nominations for Newman (Best Actor), Scott and Gleason (Best Supporting Actor), Laurie (Best Actress), director, picture, and screenplay. It is a memorable film that engulfs you from start to finish.
Pros: Acting, characters, direction, score, cinematography
Cons: Too much emphasis on melodrama of Newman and Laurie

599346,5,630321245X,"1961's ""The Hustler"" is a picture that will truly ""suck you in"".  It totally absorbed my attention throughout.  Making this in black-and-white was a wise choice by the movie-makers too.  It sets the mood of the drab surroundings we experience during the film.
A perfect cast has been assembled here, with Paul Newman a knockout in the lead role of pool shark ""Fast Eddie"" Felson.  Piper Laurie, George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton, and Myron McCormick give strong support to Newman.  And there's a very controlled and somewhat subdued Jackie Gleason as ""Minnesota Fats"".  Jackie doesn't have a huge part here, but he pulls off his role as ""Fats"" with style.
There are a lot of quiet moments in this picture ... when just visuals propel the story.  I like that in movies!  Sometimes there's too much dialogue in a film, in places where nothing needs to be said at all.  It just seemed to me that the producer/director (Robert Rossen) knew when to keep the actors quiet here.
The Hustler will forever remain a Classic to me!!

Billiard champ Willie Mosconi, 14-time world champion from 1941-1957, was a key technical adviser on the set of The Hustler, literally teaching Mr. Newman how to play the game of pocket billiards, right down to his grip on the cue stick.  Newman became quite proficient by the end of the shooting of the picture.
Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie in 1986's sequel, ""The Color of Money"", co-starring Tom Cruise.  Newman DID win the Oscar for Best Actor that year.",1007596800,12,2133,5.002832861189802

How about an achingly beautifully black and white film about shooting pool starring Paul Newman and George C. Scott?  Newman is Fast Eddie Felson, a pool hustler who is defined right from his opening scene/hustle.  His dream is to make it to the city to take on Minnisota Fats, the greatest straight pool player around.  This is where the Hustler takes a turn from your average ""Guy with a dream"" story.  It only takes about three scenes before Felson is playing against Fats, and beating him pretty badly too.  Only this game goes until someone calls it quits, and Fats eventually wear down Felson over the course of a highly enjoyable (from the viewer's perspective) sequence of pool games.  From there Felson's world crashes around him and he winds up taking sides with a big money man played by George C. Scott who teaches Felson why he lost and why he needs the killer instinct to win.  But is this really the kind of instinct a guy like Felson wants to develop?  With tight, refined filming, a wonderful script, and a cast that just keeps getting better, The Hustler is truly a great film and a wonderful movie.",994982400,6,1221,4.6157407407407405
599401,5,630321245X,"Hopelessly grandiose, Ed Felson heads east with a well heeled stooge. Hoping to embarass reigning pool champ Minnesota Fats, and yes, take his $$, they hustle the poor, the naive, and the handicapped. Once in NY, Eddie gets his shot...and blow it. Enter Burt Gordon (""I like the action""), who agrees to back Eddie in bigger and better things. Eddie meets a gorgeous waif who haunts the nearby bus station. She loves him. In Eddie she sees passion, dedication....things she herself lacks. Their tumultuous union ends as sadly as it began. Eddie realizes that he inflicted these tragedies by being a loser. He succeeds in undoing it, but its all for naught as the story ends with a whimper..like it should. Probably one of the tn best American films ever made.  But there's more: the powerhouse cast is awesome. Comedian Jackie Gleason puts forth an incredible portrayal of the loathesome Minnesota Fats. Gleason adds humanity to a character of mythic proportion. A wonderous and seemingly knowing study.  Piper Laurie's portrayal of the terminally adolescent drunk with the high IQ and romantic perceptiveness is gripping. Her death seems wrong. George C. Scott's rendition of the Devil is, ofcourse, right on. What a man! Murray Hamilton's turn as a loser hoping for that one last break is sad and convincing. Newman's ""Fast Eddie"" is easily beleivable. In fact, he seems to regale in the part. As if it were tailor-made for him. The supporting cast are just as good. Sometimes even better. Jake LaMotta should've been an actor. The cinematography is awesome. They must've had the cameras on railroad tracks. Actually, I know they did. There is a scene in this film that is magical in its seamless movement. The decision to record in B/W was a good one. The story is dank, and disturbing. The B/W only enhances it.

I'll never forget the first time I saw this splendid film--how the silence  of the opening scene makes you feel it's taking place right along with you.  No credits, no sounds--but the actual sounds of the voices, the glasses in  the bar, the pool balls, and the hard sound of the corner pocket when  Newman drops the ball after the push bank shot. Not until after he closes  the door on the car and hands the rolled up wallet full of bills to  McCormick, do you hear Hopkins' score begin. The cool, hard jazz answers  the opening scene so perfectly, defining all that follows in the movie. I  have never seen such total understanding and complete brilliance in an  opening scene, and such nuance between art direction, actors, music, and  director. And guess what--it only gets better from there. This is the magic  of great film making and we're all the better for it.",966816000,,942,4.648484848484848
599403,5,630321245X,"Many people who saw the slick and stylish Scorcese creation Color of Money didn't even realize that Eddie Felson already existed on the silver screen in The Hustler. What many people tell me when they find out and see The  Hustler is that either they hated it or loved it. That's because while  Color of Money is smooth, slick, smooth, and polished, The Hustler is raw,  biting, and powerful and so by definition it is not for everyone. Color of  Money is more about visual effects and music, which is classic Scorcese,  though there's no real substance. Scorcese himself has said in interviews  that movies like Goodfellas were close to his heart, but Color of Money was  just a commercialized creation.
The Hustler, on the other hand, really  grabs you. First off, as a pool player myself, let me tell you Tom Cruise  can't play pool worth a damn, and that lack of authenticity is a glaring  weakness to begin with. But just the fact that Newman and Gleason can play  pool does not make The Hustler a better movie - it's a masterpiece because  it is a gripping tale of human redepmption, of Eddie's battle to separate  his pool game from his self-esteem. It's also about one man's passion for  the game. How can any pool player forget that soliloquoy by Fast Eddie when  he and Sarah go for that picnic, how he talks about how he loves even just  the sound of the click of the balls, how the cue has nerves in it and is  part of his arm!
Remember that last scene in Color of Money, where young  cocky Vincent plays the older, cagier Fast Eddie and Eddie declares  ""I'm back"" before he breaks the balls? Even though the movie ends  there, everyone knows Eddie wiped up the floor with Vincent. Vincent's  character had talent, but Eddie had character, and that's what beat Fast  Eddie time he played Fats.
Bert Gordon: You got talent.
Fast Eddie: I  got talent? So what beat me?
Bert: Character.
And that's the way the  two movies are too. Color of Money has talent, but The Hustler has  character.",946080000,121,1998,4.5139664804469275
