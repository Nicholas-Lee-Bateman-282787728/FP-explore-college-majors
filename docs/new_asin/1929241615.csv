7801283,1,1929241615,Story has been exposed as a lie...trouble from this film caused the true finders of the dinosaur an indescribable amount of heartache.,1491091200,2,134,5.136363636363637
7801284,1,1929241615,"Pure fiction. Simply do a Google search on Doug Phillips, and you will find that honesty, and transparency are not his strongest characteristics. If you want fiction about kids and dinosaurs, I suggest Barney and Friends.",1451001600,3,221,5.166666666666667
7801285,3,1929241615,"I recently did some research on this video as I was mentioning it in a paper I was writing, and saw the huge controversy surrounding it. This film is NOT entirely bogus, I can speak from experience. My father and I were actually in the movie as we went on this dinosaur dig with a number of other families, mainly father/son groups. I haven't seen this movie in some time, and as I recall some of the shots were presented out of order, but other than that the film told a very true story. I cannot speak for the transport of the skull (which seems to have some of the largest controversy), but the other parts of the documentary were true, and I had an amazing experience with my father during this time. It's terrible to see it being completely blasted as false.

I am giving it a ""3 star"" because I haven't seen it in some time.",1329350400,4,830,4.253164556962025
7801286,1,1929241615,The road to this movie is full of scandal and lies.  Do a little research and you will find out that this film is totally bogus and not a true story at all.  I do not recommend this film.,1259107200,9,187,3.769230769230769
7801287,1,1929241615,"This is NOT a true story. This film has been discredited publicly and is no longer being published. Homeschooling is a noble endeavor, and it gives many families the freedom to pursue exciting experiences. We do not need to exaggerate our children's achievements, as this film does. Please exercise discernment and learn about paleontology elsewhere rather than believing the falsehoods in this movie.",1247356800,16,401,5.380952380952381
7801288,1,1929241615,"We have the movie, or, should I say, had.  We threw ours in the trash after learning that it's not actually a true story but a fake documentary.

I didn't appreciate being lied to.  (This was only one of many disappointments we would come to have in Vision Forum products).  Truth in advertising, please.",1224633600,17,304,4.574074074074074
7801289,5,1929241615,"I just recently got to see this DVD. It is excellent and very inspiring. The quality of the DVD was first class. It clearly seeks to give glory to God, the Creator of the Allosaur. I love the way the families are encouraged to work together - all ages are included in the project. While the focus is on a particluar homeschoolig group in this DVD - you do not have to be a homeschooler to participate in such a project. I highly recommend this film.

7801291,5,1929241615,"This video is a wonderful addition to any collection.  This is just the beginning for this wonderful team of Christian paleontologists.  I have personally had the priveladge of working with them.  As Fathers and Mothers, we need to be sowing the seeds of Christian vision in our children.  I strongly encourage you to watch this video with your family, and check out Creation Expeditions's website at [...]
It is time for us to take a stand against those that would say that there is no God, and that he didn't create the world like he said he did.  Creation Expeditions offers many different trips including the trip that the movie is about.  They also go the Badlands of South Dakota and several trips in Florida.
