8132270,5,B000GHF3W2,"Signing Time is the best video for learning ASL. The format of the videos are simple and fun. First the word of the sign is shown and demonstrated by the host, Rachel Coleman. Then they are repeated by young children. After a group of words are taught, they are put together in a song, sung by the host. The songs are wholesome and catchy.
