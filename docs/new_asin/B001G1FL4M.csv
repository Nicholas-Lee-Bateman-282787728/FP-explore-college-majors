3594723,4,B001G1FL4M,"Series 3 of Jonathan Creek keeps up the high standards of the first two series. The writing and plots are as ingenious as ever and Jonathan solves the mysteries with his usual diffident brilliance. There's lots of humor and Creek's boss is involved a little more, too, which is good.
  The only downside is that Caroline Quentin doesn't seem to have the same gusto and enthusiasm as Maddie that she showed in the first two series. She was replaced for season 4 (by Julia Sawalha of Ab Fab), so perhaps she'd just found that she had no more to bring to the part. She's professional enough, but the outrageous chutzpah is missing.
  Never mind, the show is still well worth watching. I'm not sure whether a new series is planned, but there have been several one-off specials, including one this past Christmas, and hopefully the BBC will release those in due course.",1240790400,13,864,4.6644736842105265

3594726,5,B001G1FL4M,"I have the entire series. However, I can only play it on my computer because when I went to buy it, it was only available in the european version. Alan & Caroline played well off each other. They made a great team & the series is excellent. You will be intrigued by each episode. Try as you might, I defy you to figure it out before the end of each show. Their comedic timing & terrific acting make this a series that you will want to watch over & over again. What's  this I hear about the title character being reprized this year in a new series?

3594727,4,B001G1FL4M,"Series 3 is a fun collection of mysteries.  For those unfamiliar with the series, it teams an investigative reporter with an illusionist (or, rather, creator of illusions for a stage magician).  The two characters play off of each other quite well, and the shows are laced with a lot of humor.  These were widely shown on BBC America here in the States.  There are 4 seasons total (thus far) and BBC has been releasing them to DVD on Region 1 at about a year apart!  So...look forward to Season 4 about a year from now....

In the meantime, there are reports that the title character is being resurrected for a new series in 2009, without Maggie.  If that's a success, maybe the BBC will get Season 4 out sooner!",1234310400,8,712,4.4728682170542635

3594750,4,B001G1FL4M,"I continue to enjoy the stories.  But Maddie has been written to be a totally different person.  She was originally written to be competent, sexy, and loving life even if it knocked her about a bit.  However, in this season, she went slumming.  Were they trying to write her out and get a younger, hotter, hipper character?  Maybe they wanted to attract the younger, pierced and tattooed, crowd.  I felt bad for her; Jonathan looked hotter and she really should have been making that work for her.  Instead, she went the other direction.  Still, good stories, even if Maddie went south.",1367798400,2,586,4.732673267326732

I am a fan of Caroline Quentin, so when I saw she was a member of the cast, that was a plus.  Alan Davies is perfect in his role. Creek is usually reluctant to get involved as he has a perfectly good job, thank you, and yet get involved he does and the fun begins. His brain seems to be caught up in solving how, not necessarily why, the crime happened. And his uninvited sidekick, Madeline Magellan, an investigative journalist, befuddles his brain even more.",1352332800,,573,4.327102803738318
3594755,5,B001G1FL4M,"Series 3 of Jonathan Creek is just as good as the first two,J C and Maddy still bring a smile to the face and more way out tales with laughs and thrills in equal measure.

3594756,4,B001G1FL4M,"There's a very paranormal slant to the third season of ""Jonathan Creek,"" as if the writers had watched a little too much ""X-Files"" -- you've got ghosts, ghouls, precognition, aliens and a pact with Satan. But fortunately the main concept (Jonathan debunks impossible crimes/tricks) is very much still in place, and Alan Davies and Caroline Quentin are still awesome.

A dinner party goes completely south in ""The Curious Tale of Mr Spearfish"" when a man claims to have signed a pact with the devil, which he credits for his newfound fame and luck. But even after a man trying to shoot him drops dead, Maddie and Jonathan suspect there's a more mundane explanation for what's happening.

And in ""The Eyes of Tiresias,"" an old lady is having dreams of future murders that have a nasty habit of coming true. In ""The Omega Man,"" Maddy is contacted by an extraterrestrial expert to take a look at an alien skeleton... only to have the US army (wha?) charge in and take it. The problem is, as soon as they unload it again, it's vanished into thin air. So guess who they drag in to help.

""Ghosts Forge"" becomes a problem when an ex-coworker of Maddy's wants them to investigate a very old murder at a creaky old manor house. Then there's a ""Miracle in Crooked Lane,"" when an ex-glamour model is almost killed in an explosion... and is seen several hours later on her way to church. Is it a true miracle, or does Jonathan have a more earthly answer?

And it all ends on a gruesome note with ""The Three Gamblers,"" in which the police find a drug dealer who was bludgeoned and shot to death has somehow crawled up a flight of stairs... AFTER he died. His killer is literally going insane with fear, and a drug cartel is causing trouble.

Obviously ""Jonathan Creek Season 3"" has a more supernatural/paranormal slant to it, and fortunately it doesn't lose its solid grip on reality. The only problem is that sometimes things get a little far-fetched -- the first episode has oh-so-convenient timing on a LOT of stuff,merely to make shady stuff look downright satanic.

But despite the supernatural/paranormal focus, the scriptwriters DO manage to stick to the core of the series -- everything must be unraveled and explained by Jonathan.

Sadly this was the last season with Caroline Quentin, because Maddy and Jonathan had finally settled into a less prickly, more comfortable little zone with each other (she even gives him a book he desperately wants). They even test the romantic waters once or twice. And Alan Davies' Jonathan seems to be a bit more comfortable with himself and his more public life (although the dweeby fanclub seems to bug him).

""Jonathan Creek Season Three"" is a much darker, weirder story than the one that came before it, but fortunately it hasn't really strayed from its core idea. Too bad there's no more Maddy after this.",1281916800,5,2841,4.725252525252525
3594757,4,B001G1FL4M,"Produced by the late great Verity Lambert , who also produced the early doctor who episodes and many other shows , this show never lets the viewer down. The characters are interesting and the leads are great. The only problem with british shows is that they don't produce lots of episodes.  Fortunately this series lasted four seasons and had 2 christmas specials and a new year special for 2009.  And there is a upcoming easter special for 2010. This show is well done and the whole family can enjoy the quirky characters and storylines. Fans of Columbo and other shows like that one; should enjoy this fun show.  Every season is great and the show should be made into a functioning series again instead of just doing specials.  This show is so good that mystery loving fans can watch all six episodes in a row and not feel fatigued!  It's that fun, and even lighthearted in some aspects; in spite of people popping up dead along the way.  Caroline Quentin as always just engages the audience just as expertly as she does in 'blue murder' which is a much more serious show.  And Alan Davies is just as expert in bringing his character to life.  This is one of my all time favorite brit mystery/ crime show and it deserves more episodes to be made.",1244073600,9,1248,4.515555555555555

8303597,5,B001G1FL4M,"The third season of ""Jonathan Creek"" is notable for being the last one to feature Caroline Quentin as Maddy Magellan. Although the introduction of Jonathan's other sidekicks in later seasons isn't a total disaster, the show is never quite the same without her. The wonderful chemistry between Alan Davis and Caroline Quentin can never be truly matched, and Maddy's vivacious personality is sorely missed.

So make the most of season three. It also tends to focus more on paranormal phenomena than crimes, with the typical episode asking ""how did this seemingly supernatural thing happen?"" rather than ""how did a criminal achieve this impossible crime?"" You can tell at times that perhaps writer David Renwick is getting a little stretched for ideas, with more than a little reliance on coincidences, but these are still six solid mysteries to absorb.

The premise is that Jonathan Creek is the trick-designer of an egotistical stage-illusionist, whilst Maddy is a struggling crime writer searching for a hook. Since the first season the two of them have flourished in each other's company, with Maddy introducing Jonathan to a series of baffling mysteries, and writing them up afterwards. Finally she's reached success with a best-selling book and the promotion begins - though Jonathan warms up surprisingly well to the onset of fame.

In ""The Curious Tale of Mr Spearfish"", Jonathan and Maddy meet a rather strange young man at a dinner party - one who attributes his newfound wealth to a deal with the devil. It can't possibly be true...but how on earth does he manage to survive two gunshot wounds to the chest?

""The Eyes of Tiresias"" involves an elderly woman who has a vivid dream about a Frenchman being murdered. The following day she's shocked to watch a news report relating the event of Frenchman Andre Masson, who died exactly as she foresaw. Jonathan and Maddy are called in to make some sense of it, but it would appear time is running out - the would-be seer has already dreamt of her own murder.

In ""The Omega Man"" Maddy gets a tip-off from noted alien expert Professor Lance Graumann, who claims to have found a complete alien skeleton. Meeting him in an empty carpark, she's astonished when the US military arrive to confiscate it. Could there be some truth to the man's story? Jonathan doubts it, but even he has trouble understanding how the skeleton managed to disappear from a guarded crate on its way to the military base.

""Ghosts Forge"" has Jonathan investigating a cold case when Maddy's ""frenemy"" Mimi Trantor beguiles him into the mystery of the eponymous Ghosts Forge. An old manor house out in the country was the location of a puzzling murder. The grizzled Ezra Carr was found stabbed in the neck, but no one stood to inherit the estate and no valuables were taken from the house. What was the motive? And why does Mimi's boyfriend mutter the house's name in his sleep?

Jonathan is roped into publicity in ""Miracle in Crooked Lane"", only to get caught up in a strange crime in a tiny village. A former model and ""professional bed-hopper"" has just sold her story to the papers and been caught up in a backlash of vitriol as a result. It doesn't seem particularly surprising that she would take her own life by setting fire to the garden shed. But how then is it that she was seen a few hours later, totally unscathed, having a pleasant conversation with a neighbor in her garden?

Finally ""The Three Gamblers"" has Jonathan approached by the police to solve a baffling occurrence. A pair of drug-dealers panic whilst dealing with the leader of a cartel and end up bludgeoning him to death in the basement of a cottage. They return with the police a few days later and are horrified to discover that the corpse has managed to climb the steps. Now their key witness is too terrified to say anything, and the police need a rational explanation if they want to bust the drug-ring.

Although not as good as season two, these are still a solid set of episodes to enjoy. Even though some rely on outrageous coincidence (""The Curious Tale of Mr Spearfish"") or convoluted storylines (""Ghosts Forge""), and some are rather easy to figure out (""The Omega Man"" and ""The Three Gamblers"") the writing is still clever and sharp. Alongside the puzzles are a number of humorous subplots, such as Maddy coming up with her own conjuring trick in order to outsmart the obnoxious Mimi Trantor, or Jonathan having to deal with the over-enthusiasm of his biggest fan.

In other words, it may not be the best season of ""Jonathan Creek"", but it's probably the funniest. And of course, the ever-simmering attraction between Jonathan and Maddy continues, based as much on verbal banter as physical attraction. Almost every word out of their mouths is a quotable gem, from Maddy's frenetic comments (""what if they give me a truth serum?"") to Jonathan's sardonic replies (""it wouldn't stand a chance."")

The departure of Caroline Quentin was a great loss to the show, and I live in hope that they'll somehow manage to bring her back for one last episode - even if it's just a cameo. It was the relationship between Maddy and Jonathan, as well as the wonderful puzzle-box plots, that made ""Jonathan Creek"" so popular, and though the mind-bending mysteries continue, it's never quite the same without her.",1399593600,,5305,4.812294182217344
