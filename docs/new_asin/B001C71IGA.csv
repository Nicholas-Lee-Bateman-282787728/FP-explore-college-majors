3506465,5,B001C71IGA,"It doesn't take long until the viewer realizes that ""The Brain of Morbius"" is an unlikely concoction, a hodgepodge homage to any number of classics and not-so-classics, the chief ingredient being of course one of the key progenitors of the science fiction genre, Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein""--with a dash of late 20th-century paranoia, ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" tossed into the brew for good measure. The risks taken here by the show's writers and producers, namely that the story collapse into a muddied incoherent mess or else come off as a stitched together patchwork of rip-offs, were significant but well worth it. What we have instead is a brilliant specimen of Doctor Who that draws on several interesting sources in good measure and synthesizes them into something highly original, thrillingly riveting, immensely entertaining, and uniquely characteristic of the show.

Who else, after all, could get away with a story so morbidly gruesome and yet so hilarious? ""The Brain of Morbius"" gets about as rough and gory as Saturday evening BBC TV in the 70's would allow, with a chilling premise underlining it all: an ingenious but twisted surgeon working to construct a body from spare parts for the preserved brain of his master, a Time Lord dictator presumed executed and long dead (All he needs is a good humanoid cranium, when who should show up at his castle door but the Doctor and Sarah Jane?). And yet moments of clever wit and cerebral comedy punctuate the story without defusing the horror in the least, nor does the overall horrific and moody atmosphere render the humor any less funny. Again, an unlikely combination of mutually conflicting elements somehow sublimates into a wonderful compound greater than the sum of its parts within the crucible of these four episodes. Indeed, this is a vividly memorable tale from early in Tom Baker's tenure as the fourth Doctor, one beloved by a vast majority of the show's fans--myself definitely included.

And what a fine release for October, just in time for Halloween!",1224547200,2,2032,5.062686567164179
3506466,5,B001C71IGA,"It's hard to believe it's been 30 years since Doctor Who came back to America in the form of Tom Baker, I missed the Pertwee episodes from their 1973 run (and in DC they were preempted that summer by the Watergate hearings).
I'd rush home from high school to see the show, a little fuzzy from the station in Baltimore.
But I was captivated.

This episode was one of the many great ones. Great mood that overcame any small defects.

I wonder if for this DVD they fixed the problem with episode one. In the epsiodic and combined version I saw, the first episode was missing the music and sound effects. It's fascinating to see from a technical standpoint  how the sound and music contribute to the atmosphere and mood of a televised show.",1222992000,,736,4.477611940298507

Baker, brilliant as always engages in a very curious battle of the minds with the villain.  Is this Doctir really the 4th?  Have there been more?

3506486,5,B001C71IGA,"We have watched the Brain of Morbius over ten times.  My children refer to it as the ""witches"" one.  It has a super-villain, Morbius, an evil time-lord, who was supposedly executed years earlier, but whose brain was rescued by his devoted servant, also the only person who can give the brain a body.  So the ""servant"", actually an intergalactically renowned scientist, has been laboring on the under-develped planet in squalid conditions to find a body for his beloved Morbius.  Morbius is very grumpy at this point, as he has been stuck in a jar for many years and is eager to destroy the Universe.  No one visits the planet for fun, so the scientist resorts to looking around at wrecked spaceships for pieces of arms and legs that he can use, and he only finds insect parts.  It turns out that his neighbors, the Sisters, have been crashing spacecraft in order to protect their elixir which gives them endless life.  There is a lot of humor in this Dr. Who.  Especially when the scientist sees the Doctor's head and thinks it would be perfect for Morbius.

Sarah and the Doctor arrive and try to fix everything.  There are double-crosses, and the Doctor almost gets burned at the stake, it's great.  The acting is great, the plot is great.",1431648000,,1241,4.646788990825688

3506497,5,B001C71IGA,"I am a new Doctor Who fan and only started with Matt Smith.  So i became a huge Nu-Who fan.  Once the night of the doctor hit (a prequel to the day of the doctor) i was a big fan then of not only the 8th doctor but I wanted to know more about Karn.  So i bought this dvd.  The story is so much fun and it is also my first 4th doctor story.  Sarah Jane Smith is great, the Doctor is very funny and Serious at the same time.  I now understand why he is often times voted the best doctor.  Anyways i thought the Mongo character was waaaay stupid and detracted from an almost perfect classic episode, but whatever it was so much fun to watch and provided a much needed background for what happened the the 8th doctor in The Night of the Doctor (webisode)",1393545600,,750,3.9932885906040267
3506498,5,B001C71IGA,"I saw this when I was a kid and still love it, how can anyone not? It has Tom Baker as The Doctor, Elizabeth Sladen as the endearingly innocent but sexy Sarah Jane, a mad scientist, a forgotten Time Lord and the sisters of Karn all together in one story!!!
This is one of my favorite Baker stories, I think it comes in about 6th on my favorite Baker stories to me just after Robots of Death, Talons of Weng-Chiang, The Hand of Fear, Pyramids of Mars and The Sun Makers.
If you love Tom Baker as The Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith then this is a MUST own, it is one of the better 4th Doctor stories from the unique gothic era of Doctor Who that was so unique to Tom Baker's run.
It's really interesting to note too that the sisterhood of Karn also appears in the short prequel before The Day of the Doctor, the mini-episode is about the 8th Doctor (Paul McGann) regenerating into the War Doctor (John Hurt) I still say Christopher Eccleson should have reprised his role as the 9th Doctor instead of forcing Steven Moffat to make up yet another Doctor and mess with the continuity.... Anyway, for those reasons The Brain of Morbius is a great buy and a great story and as always with the classic Doctor Who you have to have some bit of imagination and be able to ignore the low budget and wobby sets.
Just enjoy the story story and the characters and the great chemistry between the actors - that's what Doctor Who has always been about: relationships, characters and imagination.",1390780800,,1475,4.386861313868613

The Sisterhood's chanting make Fast Forward buttons a wonderful thing, and the ultra-cheap ""locked"" vault for the Elixir of Life is a massive joke.  Less of the Sisterhood would have made this easier to watch for me, but that is just an opinion...

Thankfully, the scenes in the scientist's lair are more watchable, and Tom Baker is always a joy to watch.  Morbius' brain is relatively well done, too.",1375660800,,477,4.710843373493976

3506503,5,B001C71IGA,"The Brain of Morbius comes from the heyday of Tom Baker's years as The Doctor and epitomizes everything that makes the classic series so enjoyable. From a script begun by Terrance Dicks and polished by Robert Holmes, the story owes much to the Frankenstein legend and the Hammer film series of gothic horror tales. There's a haunted mansion, the mad scientist and his deformed servant, the coven of ""witches"" next door, wrecked spaceships and a large raving ungainly monster. Into this setting comes the Doctor and one of his most popular assistants, Sarah Jane Smith. The unfolding of the plot reveals machinations of Time Lords and war mongerers, wrecked spaceships and a potion that gives everlasting life.
The dialogue is very witty, sometimes with jokes and puns and other times deadly earnest. It's performed by a superb cast which includes Philip Madoc as the mad scientist in a stellar performance.

The dvd itself is excellent quality video and audio and includes several featurettes that go behind the scenes, as well as actor/producer commentary on the episodes themselves and a wealth of information in the form of production subtitles.

If you've wondered why there are so many rabid fans of the series as a whole, and the mid 70s era especially, you could hardly do better than to begin with The Brain of Morbius.",1368057600,3,1327,4.946188340807175

This is another really good story from our favorite classic Doctor.  The villains were some of the best.  Stories with rogue Time Lords are always entertaining.  The monster is one of the best looking costumes in the whole franchise.  The story was interesting, the atmosphere was great, and I loved the Doctor's quote about immortality.  This is another story worthy of being a fan favorite.",1362873600,2,515,5.0
3506506,5,B001C71IGA,"If you plan to begin watching old Doctor Who stories and want to see a winner right off the bat, this is the one to acquire. I was watching Doctor Who in the USA on Public Television as they aired back in the mid-'70s, (on WOSU TV which even began running William Hartnell stories after a time!), but as the stories went on, I must have somehow missed this one.

This yarn is a spin-off of ""Frankenstein"" and the set design as well as the script are both fantastic. Philip Madoc's performance as Solon, (the pseudo- Dr. Frankenstein, Morbius was equivalent to his ""Monster"", the brain being from a former rogue Time Lord), was second to none -- brilliant!

The story is, in a nutshell, that The Doctor [Tom Baker] and Sarah land on a planet where there are two factions, Solon and a coven of witchy women who live in a cavern and produce ""The Elixir of Life"". Solon, who lives in this kinky castle of a sort,  needs a nice head as a repository for Morbius' brain and the Doctor's is perfect by his estimation. The Doctor gets captured back and forth by the two competing factions until Morbius is finally brought to life by Solon, using a plastic head which he has contrived, placed upon a cornucopia of body parts of different alien races, (which were lured into the planet where they had all crashed.) Unfortunately, Solon's Igor-ish assistant had previously knocked the brain off the shelf and it was damaged, (Abnormal brain -- of course!) So this monster is now unleashed on everyone. There is also a side complication of Sarah being blinded and that is a nice sub-plot.

There are some extra goodies on the DVD, (""How we made it stuff"", etc.), which is just icing on an already superb cake.

This is gothic horror at its best and, for my money, no other Doctor Who stands up to this fine tale.",1359244800,2,1799,4.489296636085627
3506507,5,B001C71IGA,"Producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes made gothic horror a signature theme of Doctor Who in the mid-1970s and attracted some of the largest television audiences in the show's history. Their riff on the Frankenstein story, ""The Brain of Morbius,"" topped 10 million viewers every week at a time when the U.K.'s population was 56 million.

The Doctor and Sarah land on the desolate planet Karn where an arcane sisterhood keeps vigil over a dying flame that produces an elixir of life which their order relies on to survive. Elsewhere on the planet, a brilliant but deranged neurosurgeon named Solon pieces together body parts from crash victims into a patchwork creature to contain the disembodied brain of Morbius, a rebel Time Lord long believed dead. When the Doctor arrives at his mountaintop castle, Solon believes he has found the perfect head for Morbius' brain and drugs the Doctor in hopes of surgically removing it. Meanwhile, the Sisterhood of Karn thinks the Doctor has been sent by the Time Lords to steal their dwindling supply of elixir and tries to burn him at the stake.

Among many other fine actors, ""Morbius"" showcases the work of veteran character actor Philip Madoc as the mad scientist Solon, a role the show's producers had considered offering to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. Madoc delivers a performance neither of these actors could have topped. The Welsh actor appeared in three other Doctor Who stories between 1968 and 1979, including ""The War Games"" in which he played the villainous War Lord. To give you some idea of Madoc's range, he also played the evil Huron Indian chief Magua in the 1971 BBC adaptation of ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" later featured on U.S. public television as part of the Masterpiece Theatre series. Madoc appears in the making-of documentary included with this DVD but passed away in March 2012.

The plot of ""Morbius"" has one major flaw, however: why would Solon cut off the Doctor's head and attach it to the monstrous patchwork body he's created when he could more easily transplant Morbius' brain directly into the Doctor's normal body? This gap in the story's logic grew out of the way the original script, written by series veteran Terrance Dicks, was edited by Holmes to eliminate a robot character that would have been too expensive and technically difficult to bring to the screen. Instead, the robot is replaced by Solon and his Igor-like assistant, Condo. Dicks was so outraged by Holmes' extensive rewrite that he asked to have his name removed from the project, and the script was credited to a pseudonym.

The dark, brooding tone of ""The Brain of Morbius"" as well as its heightened gore and violence made it one of the show's most memorable stories, but these elements also contained the seeds of Hinchcliffe's downfall as producer. The blood exploding from Condo's chest when he's shot by Solon and the sight of Morbius' brain splatting on the laboratory floor first attracted the censure of right-wing television activist Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, who viewed Doctor Who narrowly as a program for children. Hinchcliffe wanted to broaden Doctor Who's appeal to teenagers and adults, but Whitehouse's continued scolding, particularly of a drowning scene in ""The Deadly Assassin,"" led to Hinchcliffe's eventual replacement as producer with instructions from the BBC to his successor to tone down the show's horror content.",1331769600,6,3456,5.057894736842106
3506508,4,B001C71IGA,"Once more thanks to the shenanigans of the Time Lords, the Doctor and friend Sarah Jane Smith wind up on the mostly barren planet of Karn, a world notorious for its graveyard of crashed ships. On Karn, the Doctor explains, the Sisterhood of the Eternal Flame live. The Sisterhood are the keepers of the Eternal Flame, which is, well, a flame that burns eternally, giving forth a life-expanding elixir the Sisters drink, allowing them to have lifespans comparable to the Time Lords. But lately the Flame has begun burning low and the elixir has stopped coming, and high priestess Maren is convinced that the Doctor is here to steal it so that the Time Lords can expand their own already lengthy existences. The Doctor is captured by the Sisterhood and rescued by Sarah Jane. In the process, however, Maren uses some magic powder to blind Sarah, although she and the Doctor successfully escape. Sarah worries she is blinded permanently. And so does the Doctor.

But the Sisterhood aren't the only residents of Karn. There is also a scientist named Solon and his hook-handed assistant Condo, who are scavenging corpses from all those spaceships that have crashed on Karn over the years to build a patchwork body with no head. It turns out that Solon is a fanatical follower of the evil renegade Time Lord Morbius, who years ago had been sentenced to death without regeneration by his fellow Time Lords for a variety of heinous crimes. However brilliant scientist Solon rescued Morbius' brain, which now resides in a jar of green slime in Solon's laboratory, awaiting the completion of its new body so Morbius can come back to life and take over the universe, blah, blah, blah. Solon is just searching for the perfect head. And when he learns about the Doctor, he can't resist the idea of using a Time Lord head to house Morbius' brain.

Not one of Doctor Who's best serials, unlike the other ones I've purchased (The Seeds of Doom, City of Death and Genesis of the Daleks), but a fun time-waster with some excellent homages to older-than-dirt mad scientist tropes. The effects are a hoot. The Daleks were always charmingly doofy despite how dangerous they were, ditto for the Krynoid in The Seeds of Doom, but this... well, when Solon forgoes using the Doctor's head and instead puts Morbius' brain inside of a big fishbowl helmet with bicycle headlight eyestalks and this thing wanders around with one human hand and one crab claw hand, it's just ridiculous. To the story's credit, however, Morbius acknowledges how dumb he looks, but goes a step further and admits he doesn't care. ""Do you think I care about my ultimate appearance?!"" he rages. Morbius doesn't care what he winds up looking like, just as long as he's brought to life, and the same can be said of this wonderful series as a whole.",1329177600,2,2795,4.7727272727272725

3506510,5,B001C71IGA,"I've been reviewing a lot of bad Doctor Who lately, so it's with a sigh of relief that I turn to The Brain of Morbius, a serial I absolutely love.

In some ways, it's tough to explain the appeal of science fiction like this, which is so obviously dated. Why do I like this, and not the new Doctor Who? Why do I like this, and not Earthshock? These are the kind of burning questions that keep me occupied while I'm in the bathtub or sitting on the subway in Manhattan, because hey, it beats thinking about real life.

Ahem. I'm already getting off track - sorry about that. Allow me to make my major point: The Brain of Morbius is great because it strikes a perfect balance between being semi-serious (the threat posed by the villains is real) and being light and witty (the Doctor makes fun of everyone he meets). And while this particular serial draws inspiration from Frankenstein, it adds enough new elements to the formula - like a coven of telekinetic witches - to seem fresh. It all adds up to a humorous commentary on gothic horror, populated by actors who know exactly how to walk that fine line between camp and junk.

As an added bonus, the dialogue is crazy over-the-top and filled with big vocabulary words (rather like the wild dialogue Stan Lee wrote for Marvel comic books in the 1960s). For example, the evil Dr. Solon refers to his servant as a ""chicken-brained biological disaster""; calls the coven of witches a ""squalid brood of harpies""; and opines that the leader of the coven is a ""palsied harridan."" I particularly loved this kind of dialogue when I was a kid, and after watching Doctor Who I often scurried off to look up all the words I didn't understand. Good times. (Note that a dictionary is not really required to understand the dialogue in the new Doctor Who.)

Production-wise, this is (of course) cheesy stuff. The attempt to create an alien planet in a BBC studio fails completely, and the Morbius monster looks just a bit silly. But who cares? This is *supposed* to be funny, I suspect. Besides, a few elements of the production - like the costumes and makeup for the witches - actually look really good.

In short, The Brain of Morbius is awesome ... or perhaps ""boss"" is a better word. The DVD, meanwhile, is cool in itself; it boasts a thorough making-of documentary, narrated by eighth Doctor Paul McGann (nice to know he's keeping busy), and an amusing CGI recreation of how the sets were constructed. Also, considering the age and origin of the material, the print is good. Never before has that giant, glowing, ranting and raving brain looked so clear and spiffy. As I said above, good times.",1317772800,2,2633,4.593617021276596
3506511,4,B001C71IGA,This is an interesting short story where Tom Baker again tries to take a slow & uninteresting story line & make it interesting & part of the whole Dr. Who Universe.  Some of the events here are referenced in future episodes so it is a must watch for die hard fans.,1276128000,2,264,4.176470588235294
3506512,5,B001C71IGA,"I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS.  One of my earliest memories is the Wirrin falling out of the closet at the end of Part 2 of ""Ark in Space"".  I never really got into ""The Brain of Morbius"".  Until now.  And now I know why.  This story was apparently so controversial when it aired in Great Britain, that many UK, US and Australian viewers never saw the entire four-part story.  I was one of those deprived viewers who, until I bought this DVD, thought that ""The Brain of Morbius"" was a choppy, poorly edited two-part adventure.  This story is simply magnificent in its uncut four-part form and is truly one of the greatest stories of the early Tom Baker era if not the entire classic series.  If like me you have expressed apprehension about buying this story on DVD because you owned the 1980s/1990s VHS release, go for it - you'll be glad you did!",1270771200,3,855,4.401273885350318

3506514,5,B001C71IGA,"Great adventure in the gothic -horro style of that period of the show. We discover another mad Time Lord ( Morbius) trapped in the fogotten world and his fan boy Frankestein like Doctor building hima  new body from scrap parts. The atmosphere is grim, perfect for the story, this is a must , if you like State of Decay, you will love this one!",1245024000,,343,4.359375
3506515,5,B001C71IGA,"Tom Baker is still the best Doctor in my eyes.  This episode just shows his charm and wonder all over again.  With faithful Sarah Jane at his side as always.  Outside of Rose from the new show I think Sarah Jane was one if not the longest companion on the show.  That's one thing I would love to see on the new show, a companion that last for four or five seasons with some other companions that come and go.",1234396800,2,408,4.0625
3506516,5,B001C71IGA,"Oddly memorable, perhaps not the best or worst of the Hinchcliffe-Holmes era, but filled with all the hallmarks that made Who such fun to watch.

I always enjoy the extras, having seen these episodes for decades.  The restoration team/production team have been spicing up the extras on all DVDs very nicely.  When Hinchcliffe, Baker and Sladen are on commentary it is always a treat.  Philip Madoc also appears on the commentary, having made such a memorable performance.

""Getting A Head"" is a nice little extra to illustrate all the ideas and work that went in behind the scenes.  Poor Terrance Dicks describes his original idea which was put through the delectable Holmes sausage grinder.  His original idea was actually quite solid, but too expensive or difficult to make, then rewritten by Holmes and labels as written by Robin Bland.  Hearing all the main actors describe their experiences is many times quite humorous.

For $[...] this is a gem for anyone that enjoys the series, or anyone looking for a matinee entertainment.  On Saturday afternoon PBS in the 80's it fell into a cultural null for any non-sports fan.  These days it might look dated and clunky, but the writing of ""Morbius"" is still stronger than most TV in current broadcast, and it is more fun than most modern cinema since effects were limited and the actors and situations blazed forward.

Good stuff.",1228348800,3,1380,4.900862068965517
3506517,5,B001C71IGA,"I out-and-out love this story.  I've taken the typical ""Doctor Who"" fan's path to this point of view, however.  I was riveted at age 11, embarrassed at age 16, and now celebrate it in all its campy glory.  When the disembodied brain of Morbius fell onto the floor with an audible ""splat!"" late in Part Three, I actually cheered.

What's most impressive about the DVD release is the Restoration Team's attitude to the story.  Now that the classic series DVDs have been coming out for almost ten years, and the greatest of the great stories have long since been released, and the available remaining stories come from deep in the third tier (and now, with the imminent release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Four-to-Doomsday-Episode-118/dp/B001GJ4U50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Four to Doomsday (Episode 118)</a>, the fourth tier), it is hard to predict what editorial slant the DVD extra features will take.  I've been surprised, for example, by the coldness toward&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Black-Orchid-Episode-121/dp/B0017XOFFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Black Orchid (Episode 121)</a>, and I nodded along to the wistful revelation that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Invisible-Enemy-K9-and-Company-A-Girl-s-Best-Friend/dp/B001AGXEBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Invisible Enemy/K9 and Company: A Girl's Best Friend</a>&nbsp;just hasn't aged that well at all.

Fortunately, the DVD producers appear to love Morbius, and for roughly the same reasons that I do.  They're perhaps a little too enamored of Philip Madoc's Shatner-esque turn as this story's Dr. Frankenstein stand-in, Solon.  But everyone loves the dimly heroic Condo, the one-armed manservant standing in for Igor.  Even Terrance Dicks, who took his name off the final version of the story, seems to have warmed up to it considerably -- and we know from many other past DVD releases that Uncle Terry isn't shy about picking a fight with a 35 year-old bit of TV history.

All in all, ""Brain of Morbius"" blends two elements of ""Doctor Who"" greatness.  First, a terrific script by Robert Holmes, full of memorable insults (""That palsied harridan!"") and throw-away world building (the lone reference to ""the silent gas dirigibles of the Hoothi"", which 15 years later was resurrected for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-and-War-The-New-Doctor-Who-Adventures/dp/0426203852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love and War (The New Doctor Who Adventures)</a>.  And second, there's that fearless 1970's mentality that ""We're going to get away with putting a rubber brain in a fishbowl and mounting that on an ill-fitting costume with chicken feathers and an enormous lobster claw"".

The only curiosity is that, while the text commentary accurately describes Terrance Dicks' novel-writing career as including the Past Doctor Adventure&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warmonger-Doctor-Who/dp/056353852X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warmonger (Doctor Who)</a>, the writer curiously fails to mention that it was in fact a prequel to this story.  Just as well, however.  Unlike this DVD, you might want to give that book a miss.",1226707200,14,3375,6.601809954751131
