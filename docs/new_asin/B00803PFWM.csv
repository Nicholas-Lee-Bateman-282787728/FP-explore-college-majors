5115484,4,B00803PFWM,"It is difficult to rate properly when there are three different movies in one package.  Two deserve 5 stars and one deserves 1 star.  Let's look at the movies individually:

A Simple Twist of Fate (five stars) is a touching story of a lonely man who is invaded by a toddler.  The child's mother is killed in a car accident and the baby wanders into the man's home, drawn by the glow from the fireplace.  The child's father, a promising politician, denies any knowledge of the baby, helps the single man adopt the child, and finds his wife incapable of bearing children.  As the child develops the father begins to crave the child to replace the fetuses his wife has lost.  In the end the adoptive father wins custody.  The acting is good, the plot is rather hackneyed, but it turns into a heartwarming film.

\First Do No Harm (five stars) is a very meaningful story.  A family of two parents and three children live in the midwest and the father, a truck driver, changes jobs not realizing he has lost his family's health insurance by the change,  The youngest child develops epilepsy and his health becomes critical.  The child is admitted to the hospital pediatric intensive care unit, a specialist in this type of disease is called for consultation and treatment and then the hospital learns the family has no health insurance.  The young boy is removed from intensive care and after a day in the wards is sent home.  The specialist never appears because of no insurance.  The father learns his new job will not have health insurance until he has worked for six months and then the inusrance will not cover the boy because of pre-existing condition.  The family learns of a treatment that does not use drugs but a special nutritional program.  Doctors advise against this because it has not been proven scientifiicly that it is effective.  Eventually the boy is treated with this diet and recovers.  The end of the movie is an advertizement for this treatment, but it also serves a purpose in showing that America, a great nation that values the family and children, is behind the civilized world in our pathetic health system.

Unstrung Heroes (one star) touted as ""One of the best films of the year"" gives me no proof that it is any good at all.  The plot, if one exists, is very hard to follow, the charachteriusation is very weak, the acting is not promising but the critics apparently like it.  You decide if you waste your time watching it.

For the price I'd say this is a good collection.",1361577600,5,2500,4.619047619047619
5115485,5,B00803PFWM,Nice triple feature. Fun movie times. Great price for entertainment.  The best part is we had not seen any of these movies.,1360108800,,123,4.590909090909091
5115486,5,B00803PFWM,"I haven't had a chance to watch all three of these movies; but, I've never seen a really bad movie with these stars to entertain us.",1359158400,,132,4.115384615384615
5115487,4,B00803PFWM,"I bought this for A Simple Twist of Fate, but Unstrung Heroes really was wonderful.  All three stories are a keeper.",1358726400,,116,4.523809523809524
5115488,5,B00803PFWM,"Simple Twist of Fate is based on the old book Silas Marner  if you love the idea of  a curmudgeon of a man that is greedy, rescuing a  baby that is abandoned at his home, and raising her as his own. havign obstacles with the local politician and friends with realistic and great neighbors ,definitley worth a look. the other 2 are pretty good. but for a video for under ten dollars, definitely a must.  ty to vendor, on time great transaction.",1354924800,,443,4.365853658536586
5115489,5,B00803PFWM,I purchased the DVD for Unstrung Heroes.  Story of a family with who had great difficulty and comes together.  Simple twist of fate is a good story too.  I have not watched the other movie.  Would recommend for yourself or it would make a great gift.,1353801600,,250,4.369565217391305
5115490,4,B00803PFWM,"""A Simple Twist of Fate"" is fantastic; it was the reason we bought this multiple-feature dvd.  It is a really good adaptation of the book by George Eliot called Silas Marner (you might want to read the book first; it's really good).  Steve Martin is fantastic in this movie.

""Unstrung Heroes"" is just weird.  The language is foul; the people are all dysfunctional.  I'm not sorry I watched it once, but I very likely will not bother watching it again.

""First Do No Harm"" is very well acted.  It's pretty intense, as the young boy has severe epilepsy, and the little actor who plays the part is amazingly talented.  Meryl Streep is always excellent.  I haven't taken the time to research the claims made by the movie, but if it's true . . . WOW!",1352851200,3,746,4.466666666666667
5115491,5,B00803PFWM,"Excellent!  This movie is fabulous!  I haven't watched Simple Twist of Fate, nor First Do No Harm.  I plan on watching these in the future.",1350950400,,139,4.48

5115502,4,B00803PFWM,"I liked ""A simple Twist of Fate"" (seen it before) and I loved ""First do no harm"" movies that make me think and cry. I believe crying cleanses the soul. My husband said ""if a man cries, people will call him a cry baby"" and I told my husband that most women love it when a man shows he's human and not afraid to show his tender side. I really hate mucho guys; they are so insensitive and not pleasant to be around. I hope that Hollywood will make more movies like the ones that I truly love. Make it about the plot and not about beautiful women in bikinis. I refuse to watch a movie that displayed women as cheap and with no self-respect for themselves. I highly recommend August: Osage County with Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep; these women are NOT wearing makeup but look like ordinary every day women (like us) I loved that in a movie! I went to the theater and saw the movie THREE TIMES.",1399593600,,890,4.2105263157894735
5115503,5,B00803PFWM,"Loved Simple Twist of Fate, but the other movie must have been included because it could never become a hit.",1388361600,,108,4.45
5115504,5,B00803PFWM,"I haven't enjoyed a movie like the Simple Twist of Fate & Unstrung Heroes + Do No Harm in such a long time. Meryl Streep
is an out standing actress and that makes it  the better. I can not express how wonderful  each of these movies are. I will
promise you , you will love them too. A wonderful afternoon at the movies at home.",1387584000,,327,4.015384615384615
5115505,5,B00803PFWM,"This is a wonderful set of movies and the price is right too. Medical schools should require every Intern to watch ""First Do No Harm"" before they get their degree. This is not the first time I have heard about diet as an alternative to medicatiion and this movie really brings home the message that we are killing oursleves with drugs. Buy it and pass it on to anyone who is struggling with cronic illness ... not just Epilepsy",1387238400,,427,4.417721518987341
5115506,5,B00803PFWM,The first two - A Simple Twist of Fate and Do NO Harm - are very good. Do No Harm is fact based.,1382400000,,96,3.217391304347826
5115507,3,B00803PFWM,"I bought this group only for the otherwise great Meryl Streep movie, which is not one of her better works.",1379721600,,106,4.35
5115508,4,B00803PFWM,"Good movies, love all the actors in all 3, especially Meryl Streep. My favorite I think is ""First do no Harm"" it makes you think of our medical society, how people automatically think because they are doctors....they are right. She chose to go against the doctors and saved her sons life.....very moving! The other 2 were good, with ""Twist of Fate"" next choice and then ""Unstrung Heroes"". For the price, I nice clean way to spend the weekend, no cussing, violence....",1370908800,,467,4.777777777777778
5115509,5,B00803PFWM,"In search of a single film, I ended up with three. It was a good deal and I took it. So easy shopping on Amazon. Lots of choices, which can be bad, I can end up with three times as much, but ""the price is right!""",1366934400,,212,3.630434782608696

8523505,5,B00803PFWM,Only bought this for the movie Simple twist if fate. I have not watched the others yet. But for the price I don't have to. This is a great movie. Even appropriate for most children. There is a couple of scenes that show drug and alcohol use but it shows them in a negative light.,1441411200,,279,4.090909090909091
8523506,5,B00803PFWM,"UNSTRUNG HEROES is a wonderful movie, with vivid, quirky characters! Despite the gard thing that happens, this movie has a lot of Love, family values, and Hope in it. Highly recommend.",1433808000,,184,4.967741935483871
8523507,2,B00803PFWM,"""First Do No Harm"" is worth the watch.  ""A Simple Twist of Fate"" is barely okay.  ""Unstrung Heroes"" is a ridiculous waste of time.",1429920000,,130,4.375
