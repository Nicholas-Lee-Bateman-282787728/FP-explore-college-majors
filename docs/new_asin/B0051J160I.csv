4522920,5,B0051J160I,"It's been some time since we've seen a fresh film from Director Monte Hellman and ""Road to Nowhere"" proves it was worth the wait! Imagine what you would do if you were making a film and discovered the actress you thought was perfect for the lead was MORE than perfect - in a really frightening way!

Besides the story-within-the-story concept of this film, I was impressed with the cinematography and grade-A production values of so many of the scenes. ""Road to Nowhere"" is another tumultuous achievement for Monte Hellman.",1311465600,6,523,4.876404494382022

4522929,4,B0051J160I,"Road to Nowhere (Monte Hellman, 2010)

Like everyone else, I knew the name Monte Hellman thanks to his cult favorite Two-Lane Blacktop (which stars a young James Taylor, of all people); I had no idea he was still making movies until a few years ago, at which point I set out to try and track a few down. Netflix Instant Streaming was my friend, first pointing me to the anthology flick Trapped Ashes, of which Hellman's entry is the best by a country mile, and then to this wonderful little talk-piece-[censored for Amazon consumption]-slow-thriller, the kind of avant-garde nightmare that tends to make fans of more accessible thrillers cringe (thus, I would assume, its low ratings at the usual suspects; 5.5 at IMDB, 38% public on Rotten Tomatoesbut, as I am fond of noting when I see it, the gulf between the public and the critical receptions to this movie is massive. The critical rating at RT: 79%). I'll add to the gap: I think it's [censored for Amazon consumption] brilliant, though I have to agree with Roger Ebert's pithy quote that the film plays like an exercise in frustrating audiences. This is a thriller for Apichatpong Weerasethakul fans, at least if I am any yardstick to judge by.

Steven [do I REALLY have to not include the name of the scriptwriter, geniuses? You need a better ""obscenity"" filter] (All Men Are Mortal)' script is an ensemble piece masquerading as a straightforward thriller. The surface plot: a hot young filmmaker, Mitchell Haven (Snakes on a Plane's Tygh Runyan), heads into the backwoods of the deep south to make a movie based on a local unsolved mystery. He finds, and casts, a leading lady who seems to be everything he could want for his movie, Laurel Graham (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shannyn Sossamon); she knows all kinds of trivia about the crime even Mitchell is unaware of. Eventually, that leads to the question: is Laurel Graham actually Velma Duran, the supposed culprit?

But trying to give you an easy synopsis of a Monte Hellman movie strikes me as being as frustrating, and as spurious, an exercise as trying to do the same with a film by one of Hellman's contemporaries, Jon Jost. It's not a casual comparison; I get the same things from Jost's filmic exercises, those I've seen anyway, as I do from Road to Nowhere. The plot wanders in and out of focus as other interesting subplots take to the fore, almost as if something interesting had caught the director's eye and he said hey, let's take this out and see where it goes if we let it wander off down its own road. That can be an exercise, for some viewers, in beating one's head against the wall. This isn't Steven Seagal action movie stuff, the kind of movie where a committee goes over the script and the first question they ask about every scene is how does this scene advance the main plot?. That's the kind of advice you get in how-to-write books, and if you're looking to appeal to the Hollywood-loving masses, it's valuable advice. But Road to Nowhere is something different. Hellman was looking for art, I think. My head keeps coming back to Jon Jost; there is a lot of meat on the bone of comparing Road to Nowhere to Jost's similar wandering thriller Last Chants for a Slow Dance, methinks.

Putting all that aside and looking at the technical aspects of the film, the things that are going to keep the non-art-school kids interested, well, there's not much to complain about; Hellman pulled together an exceptional cast (John Diehl, Dominique Swain, Cliff de Young, and Waylon Payne round out the principals), put them all in front of award-winning Spanish cinematographer Josep Civit (Anguish), and let them all do what they do best. Are you going to like it? I can't tell you that. Did I? I loved it. This is the kind of movie that, if you see it with a group of friends in an otherwise-deserted theater, will have you sitting in the dive bar next door until closing time arguing about it.

4522931,5,B0051J160I,"Monte Hellman cares deeply about the ""look"" of his films and how the images affect people emotionally. ROAD TO NOWHERE (2010) is a thing of beauty that captures mundane Los Angeles interiors, exotic European locales and backwoods North Carolina with equal care.

Editor Cline Ameslo understands Hellman's vision and unique sense of pacing where long takes are balanced by the quick cutting of snappy dialogue sequences. In addition, there's a surprising use of optical effects.

Shannyn Sossamon and Tygh Runyan are believable as the star-crossed lovers. As in VERTIGO (1958), a tragic ending seems inevitable, but we can't stop watching.

On the soundtrack, the songs of folk troubadour Tom Russell (""The Road to Nowhere"") provide an aural continuity that adds to the sinister undercurrent. If you want to know what the movie is about, just listen to the lyrics.",1379116800,,863,5.194244604316546

That implies some kind of shaking of lethargy, of some kind of low period which is not at all indicated by the bold confidence and clarity of vision in ROAD TO NOWHERE. This is a film that breaks new ground with a confidence in the new emerging digital tools that several timid young film-makers are too restrained from engaging with. Hellman's film revolves around film production, the process of making films today and what it involves. By removing the glamour and mystery involved in the complicated nature of film-making, Hellman is able to ask essential questions about being an artist who expresses through the film medium, his relations with his crew, his actors and the production, the thin wavering line between the real and the fictional, a line which this film is bold enough to suggest is actually nonexistent. There is no separation, we move through life in confusion about who we and others really are, we are all on the road to nowhere.",1378771200,,1041,4.7569060773480665

4522939,4,B0051J160I,"Monte Hellman made his name with a couple of mystical, gritty westerns in the 1960s, went on to have associations with Sam Peckinpah and Quentin Tarantino, and in the middle of all that made a couple of genre-defining road pictures in the early 1970s. All of this was gritty stuff, touched with palpable realism. Given that this is a director that has always been interested in redefining himself, it's not a surprise that Hellman should enter 21st century filmmaking with a distinctly 21st century film. Working off a beautiful script and stunning performances, Hellman weaves a take suffused with reality and unreality, and he makes it work like a dream.

Here's an interview and review of the film I did here:

4522941,5,B0051J160I,"If you haven't yet seen Monte Hellman's last feature, you should--and not once, but several times. This is a fascinating head-scratcher that grows in impact and complexity while you're watching it, and then takes you somewhere pretty startling. Check it out!",1378598400,6,258,5.317073170731708
4522942,4,B0051J160I,"Pretty much everything that critics (amateur and professional) have said about this movie is true, both the positive and the negative. And yet....this is one of those failures/successes (like The Paperboy) that you do not want to miss. Monte Hellman made a masterpiece back in 1971 called Two-Lane Blacktop which starred two non-actors (James Taylor and Dennis Wilson), and that film established Hellman as one of the most interesting filmmakers of the early 70's but his entire reputation rests on that one effort. He made other films but none received much attention, until Road to Nowhere, a film which many see as a return to form. Be that as it may, this film stands on its own. It doesn't need the Hellman or Two-Lane mythos to seduce you. Its got plenty of seductive power of its own.

 In a way, Road to Nowhere is a chance for Hellman (or any cinephile in the audience) to examine his or her own relationship to cinema. On the one hand, the film is full of references to favorite films (The Lady Eve, The Seventh Seal, Spirit of the Beehive) and can be read as an homage to cinema and to a life spent in the company of grand illusions and magnificent obsessions, but it can also be read as a deconstruction of the grand illusions and magnificent obessions that drive people to make or spend their lives around art. Formally, the film resembles Altman's The Player in that Road to Nowhere is a story of an industry type who gets caught up in a real-world film noir. But tonally and thematically the film is a closer cousin to Hitchcock's Vertigo and an even closer cousin to David Lynch's Twin Peaks and Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive...films in which players try out alternative identities/realities and live in a kind of nowhere somewhere between fact and fiction. In Road to Nowhere, everyone plays a part in two separate realities (they each play their real-world identity/reality and their cinematic identity/reality). In one of these realities the players do exactly what they did in actual life (and, essentially, play themselves), and in the other reality these same actors play the same parts but as the director imagines them to be. In effect, we are watching two films, one in which the truth is told and one in which it isn't.

 It must be said that the plot, even when it makes sense (and it does make sense once you figure out the rules of the game) really tests the boundaries of believability (especially when it comes to Laura Graham/Velma Duran and her willingness to reprise her real-life self onscreen). And so I completely understand the one star reviews. But this film is not trying to recruit you based on its believability (Vertigo, after all, was not believable). The film lures you in because it assumes you too will fall in love with the lead actress and follow that obsession no matter where it takes you even it means no longer caring about such mundane things as believability. The fictional director does not at any point care about the real-world crime on which his story is based, he only cares about his story and for him its a love story, and the film he is makiing is his grand illusion, his magnificent obsession, his ecstatic truth (to use one of Herzog's favorite phrases). If you are willing to play along, this film will find a spot on your year-end best of list, if you're not willing to play along, the film will find a spot on your year-end worst of list.

 I'll be absolutely honest, its the only film I've ever seen that I would feel perfectly justified putting on either or both.

 Spoiler alert: The casting (and this film makes a big to do about casting) is excellent. But the stand out is Shannyn Sossamon (Lauren Graham/Velma Duran). Velma Duran posing as Lauren Graham is cast to play herself (even though the director doesn't know Lauren Graham is the actual Velma Duran), but just so the director won't catch on she must pretend that it takes her awhile to figure the part out and the greatest pleasure (or one of the many) is watching her slowly become herself.

 Footnote: For me, the film that was constantly in my mind while watching Road to Nowhere was Lee Daniel's The Paperboy which was also panned and also featured a cast of characters who each followed their own private obsessions (however tenuously bound to the real world and perilous those obsessions may have been). Both are Southern Noirs. Both extraordinary. Both worth seeing more than once. And, yes, both make my best of list for their respective years.",1363219200,5,4488,4.684010152284264

It is an incredible achievement at this stage in his career. I don't know how this film was so overlooked by the press and for awards. It would have been among my top films of the year when it came out, had I not just caught up to it on DVD 2-3 years later. The film is a puzzle that doesn't need to be solved to be enjoyed and it is told with such ease that every moment is a pleasure. Effortless direction. Fascinating and well-creafted screenplay. Beautifully shot. Nice performances all around. Shannyn Sossamon really shows what she can do far beyond any of her work I've seen before.

More or less that's what he says. No one plays really good although the main female actress has its moments. There are some great images in the film, and there is maybe a plot and a story behind all this (although you'll have to figure that out).

""Road to Nowhere"" (referring to the real-life road in North Carolina where the story is set) is about a young film director Mitchell Haven (Tygh Runyan) trying to make a film about one unsolved mystery surrounding ""Velma Duran"" (Shannyn Sossamon). He casts an unknown Laurel Graham (Shannyn Sossamon) who apparently resembles her, but his growing obsession to filmmaking slowly leads him and his star to unwelcome results.

Employing a film-within-a-film narrative method, the director blurs the line between reality and fiction. He succeeds, to be sure, with a fragmented story-within-story and numerous flashbacks, but I am not sure what point he is trying to make in doing that. The film's confusing narrative will disorient and frustrate audiences for no other purpose than being disorienting and frustrating.

Imagine what audiences would say, critics or not, if some young filmmaker, not Monte Hellman, had made ""Road to Nowhere""? The film would be deemed as a pretentious mess, which I think ""Road to Nowhere"" is.",1334880000,2,1283,5.1

So, sorry, ""Road to Nowhere"" was a road to nowhere. The story lacked clarity and believability; it was too fragmented and jumped so much that nausea was beginning to set in; acting had a robotic read-a-line artificiality with an overly staged feel to it; filming largely took place in a few cost saving settings - house, park and roadway; low quality audio and no subtitles made it hard to follow along with the story; there's an inverse relationship between the number of acknowledgements and thank you for assistance credits and the quality of a movie.

The Amazon reviewer who complained that ""There were numerous shots that seemed to last 45 seconds to a minutes (sic) which could have been cut down to about 10 seconds and the viewer would have gotten the same message from the shot"" seems to have both got the point and completely missed it: Hellman is not interested in imparting plot information as efficiently and concisely as possible, but rather, in the style of many European films (such as Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL and Erice's THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE, both of which are quoted in ROAD TO NOWHERE), is more concerned with evoking emotional states and portraying the kind of behavior which most American filmmakers would consign to the cutting room floor.

I have to make a comparison which is not one of exactitude but of general feeling with the movies of Lynch and the way they use sensations as the vehicle of the movie and the ""mise en abyme"" is its powerful engine and it is an important compliment coming from me.

You have to let yourself getting swallowed by Monte Hellman's multiple versions of reality that only cinema as a medium allows and float in that in appearance quite random (only in appearance though) mix of moments that connect together on a much more profound level that you may feel initially if you try to rationalize the story, the storytelling and find a message in this movie.

I am all for rationalizing things in general, critical and independent thinking in real life but this is art and there are no rules in art, or at least there should not be in my conception of it.

I love rational and well structured movies but the real purely artistic ones are the ones that do the thing that only them can, they speak directly to your real self, a mix between you conscious and unconscious that in my mind they have been carefully crafted (consciously or unconsciously) by the filmmaker, not enough of conscious and you have often fascinating but very hard of access pieces of radically experimental cinema and not enough unconscious and you have some often amazing movies but which tends to work only on one level or maybe two, staying at the entrance of the dark forest that is your deep self.

Monte Hellman like Lynch or Malick is one of the rare directors whom manages to find the right balance between all the above elements and for that and the very intense moments that they create for us as spectators, he has got my eternal thanks, for what its worth !!

To finish as an advice for the viewer, let yourself go to your sensations and do not intellectualize the film on the first viewing as this is surely going to be the first of many if you let the film take you and that you surrender to it !!",1316304000,3,2062,4.458885941644563

This movie within a movie, story within a story, rich with characters, doubles, and parallels revolves around a mystery within a mystery, making it, to quote the film, ""The Film Noir of our dreams"". I don't mean that in any plain terms.

Like many great moving pictures, it's easier to understand than explain. And one prefers not to explain it to themselves or others because 1.) the truth isn't what important. And 2.) If you need it explained to you then you need to look closer. You have likely been spoiled by the over expository movies of the last decade. The crime is simple. It's the intentions that are complicated. This applies to both the movie and it's characters and the viewer...

The script for this movie makes me feel like a jealous edged out lover of film and yet can't help but smile at wonderfully subtle pieces of humor and movie lore references. I'd pay hard cash to see this cast in just about anything. Faces and talents Hollywood is simply too malnourished to use more like Cliff De Young, Fabio Testi, and John Deihl.

This isn't a movie to zone out to. It's a movie to wake up the dormant cinephile to.

Would have loved some more DVD feature as I always enjoy Hellman's commentaries. Maybe someday we'll get a Criterion.

Bottom line: ROAD TO NOWHERE is a beautifully thoughtful and enigmatic return of a great director. Maybe one of his best. Definitely one of my TOP 5 favorite films of the year.

Monte Hellman is back. Now I can sleep better at night and stay awake in the theater.",1316304000,17,1712,4.524271844660194
4522957,5,B0051J160I,"There  is no shortage of movies about making movies.  Plenty of them, from ""The Big Knife"" to Contempt,""  have been damn good.  But  none of them comes close to ""Road to Nowhere,""  a movie that goes outside what most people think a movie is supposed to be. Director Monte Hellman is so far into his own dream that he loses, or pretends to lose, the movie.  ""Road to Nowhere"" is all about letting go of the reins and being dragged though the crimson pastures by a movie gone loco.

Take a look at Monte Hellman's  filmography and you'll find half a dozen masterpieces throughout a half century of film-making.  His best pictures were so out of step with what his so-called peers were making that he never got a piece of that ""golden era"" pie that everyone was  saying was so sweet.  1965's back-to-back westerns ""The Shooting"" and ""Ride in the Whirlwind"" weren't much like westerns at all,  yet their existential dread  fixed the direction of the ""new westerns"" that would follow.  ""Two Lane Blacktop, "" which pitted James Taylor on a cross country drag race against Warren Oates, was about the slowest fast-car movie anyone had ever made, and had the misfortune to be released just four months after the heart-stopping  ""Vanishing Point."" Then there is ""Cockfighter,"" with Oates under a vow to keep his mouth shut until he wins the cockfighter of the year award. So we have a movie in which the protagonist doesn't speak a word until the end, Not only that, but it was released to drive-in theatres under the lame title ""Born to Kill"",  in the same month that saw the release of Sam Peckinpah's higher-profile but similarly offbeat ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia,"" also starring Warren Oates.  Then there is ""Iguana,"" a cautionary fable about a deformed man who crowns himself king of an island and enslaves all those who wash up on his beaches. It was a brilliant film with many fearsome touches but went unseen and unappreciated. Now, twenty-two  years later, Hellman returns to prove that when the light is on his side, he is still a damn good movie director.

From the beginning, we can't be sure if we are in the right theatre. A journalist who has sold her article about some mysterious woman named Velma pops a DVD into her computer. A voice tells us Velma is the entrance into the film, but what do we know of any Velma except such a name was once given to a character in a Raymond Chandler novel? We have come to see a Monte Hellman picture, and  the credits tell us  we are watching a film by Mitchell Haven.

When  a director holds a shot longer than seems necessary, it is usually because there is something in that shot that he is giving the audience time to discover. Not so here. Velma, or the actress playing Velma, possibly before she even knew she was playing Velma, or maybe when she actually was Velma, paints and blow dries her fingernails. The length of the shot seems to be determined by the length of the song (""Help Me make It Through the Night"")  that Velma listens to while doing her nails, but the shot doesn't end with the song.  When the song is over, the sound of the blow dryer fills the space, and the shot doesn't end until Velma finishes drying her nails, and the following shot depicts Velma  directing  the dryer to her face. The opening sequence, comprised of  these two shots, ends in the silence when the blow dryer is turned off.  So why did we spend so much time watching a girl with her blow dryer?  Because she is the entrance to the dream.

If ninety percent of a director's job is in the casting, Mitchell Haven comes across as ninety percent of an idiot,  having turned down Leonardo DiCaprio and Scarlett Johansson in favor of a has- been leading man gone to seed and an inexperienced girl. In his own words, he is not the kind of director  to  cast celebrities simply because they will enable his films to make  money.  But his Laurel Graham is such a bad actress that she is liable to cost him the movie.  To emphasis how bad she is, Hellman follows  a screening of  the abysmal dailies with a scene of Graham and Haven watching ""The Lady Eve"" in a hotel room.  Not only is Graham no match for Barbara Stanwyck, but Haven is certainly no Preston Sturges.  And they both fall into that chasm  standing between  inspiration and capability.

The difference between a dream and a nightmare is that a nightmare has a plot. Dreams are held together by associations so free that the dreamer is always certainly mad.  Haven's scriptwriter tries to hold the movie together, but Haven has already cut it to ninety pages and the film is still running four hours.  There is no time for narrative coherence.  The actors are losing their lines as the film becomes completely about Velma, and the film crew watches drearily as the shoot goes into the toilet.  Or so it seems.  It is the syndrome Fellini explored in ""8 1/2,"" in which the director is the only person who knows what the movie is about and the director doesn't know what the movie is about.  However, if he keeps looking for the movie, at the expense of simply filming the script, the movie has a chance of breaking out of its doldrums and emerging as a real work of art.
Instead, Haven's picture becomes a dream that trespasses against reality, and ends in a crime scene where the camera-wielding director is ordered by the police to drop his weapon. And what about Hellman's picture? For one thing, Hellman doesn't get lost , as does Haven, in Laurel Graham. Instead, he  searches for the lost Laurie Bird, who starred in both ""Two Lane Blacktop"" and ""Cockfighter"" before shacking up with Art Garfunkle and committing suicide at the age of 25.  ""Road to Nowhere"" is dedicated to Laurie, and she is the real key to the film, just as Warren Oates was the spectre that haunted and informed ""Iguana.""

How far into his dreams does the filmmaker dare travel in the attempt to resurrect the dead from the ruins of memory? Hellman goes all the way, knowing that art is his only means of bringing the dead back to life.  In the title song, Tom Russell sings, "" Even Lazarus keeps staggering down that eternal road to nowhere.""  And so does Hellman.  His movie is filled with his love for the movies and all the people who make them, from the anguished scriptwriters who despair at seeing their work reach the screen intact to the actors and actresses whose inner light  isn't always enough to light up the movie screen.

Art cannot be made from stale templates that provide easy access to a mass audience. Hellman has always made genre pictures, but has always subverted the genres and, in so doing, has stretched the possibilities for the genre filmmakers who followed him.  It always takes someone who is willing to sacrifice logic for a higher truth  to break open a genre and share the goods inside it.  ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" would have been impossible without ""Ride in the Whirlwind."" ""Iguana"" would have been impossible without ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God.""  And ""Road to Nowhere"" would have been impossible without ""The Big Sleep.""  Where most directors are content to tell a story, the best of them want to break through the story into the dream where it had its inception.

There is a scene about forty minutes into the picture in which Haven talks with Nathalie Post, the blogger who broke the true-crime story upon which his film is based.  When Post complains that the motives of the criminals don't make any sense, Haven replies, ""If it all made sense, I wouldn't be interested.""  I am sure this line echoes Hellman's sentiments exactly.",1316304000,2,7558,4.570260223048328

Other reviewers may have enjoyed the artsy fartsiness of the film but this film has NO entertainment value AT ALL!
If lingering shots of characters blow drying her nails, walking down hallways or tying their shoes is your thing, you will enjoy this movie.  There were numerous shots that seemed to last 45 seconds to a minutes which could have been cut down to about 10 seconds and the viewer would have gotten the same message from the shot.
The plot is difficult to follow since the movie is about a movie about a crime.  Both the leading lady and actor play the criminals and the actor and actress playing the the criminals in the movie.  Very confusing... There is also some underlining plot of a hundred million dollar fraud which is never explained.

4522960,5,B0051J160I,"ROAD TO NOWHERE is one of the best films of the last five years.

In an era when studios reiterate franchises and indies wander between mumbling and low-budget high-concept, writer Gaydos and director Hellman chart out an entirely different course. ROAD TO NOWHERE is an art photograph that moves and breathes, an allegory of media today, and a tribute to cinema as we once knew it.

The story is simple. A young filmmaker shoots a movie based on a true story, and things go very, very wrong. That is all you need to know.

It's a simple enough premise. But upon this premise, the writer and director concoct a marvelous hall of mirrors, a myth of media in our age--an age in which media swallow up reality and belch forth something entirely other.

Shot on Canon DSLR's with Nikon prime lenses, ROAD TO NOWHERE is one of the most beautifully shot movies in years. To my eye, no studio confection can match the shimmering muted quality of these images. As a moving photograph, ROAD TO NOWHERE glances at cable TV, great movies of the past, internet video, laptop video production, and every other form of image-currency that zaps around the globe in our postmodern media economy. The narrative is similarly zig-zaggy, though ultimately barebones.

ROAD TO NOWHERE is also haunted by movies like VERTIGO and THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE--movies about men lost in the image of a woman, movies about actresses, movies about loving a woman who's dead, movies about making a movie about loving a woman who's both alive and dead at the same time.

Shannyn Sossamon, Cliff De Young and Waylon Payne are notable for their wildly different performances of smoldering beauty, narcissistic self-absorption, and submerged rage (respectively).

ROAD TO NOWHERE is a quiet movie of sudden noises, loss and resignation, beauty and banality. It repays the attention it demands.",1313452800,13,1858,4.916932907348243
