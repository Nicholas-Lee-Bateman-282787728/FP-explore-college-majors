6491575,5,B00LMF99TK,"I can't say enough about the Plantar Fasciitis Institute DVD and how VERY pleased I am with the results.  I am a retired teacher (after spending 38 years on my feet a lot and walking and hiking many miles each day).  I developed Plantar problems and painful feet for SEVEN months and after investing in insoles, lotions and doctor visits I FINALLY GOT RELIEF from this DVD. If you are considering buying this DVD - don't hesitate! - The exercises are SO simple, quick (only 10, 15 or 30 seconds each) and have such amazing resultsI got great relief after only a few days.",1405382400,9,571,4.480769230769231
6491576,5,B00LMF99TK,"Just to let you know, I bought your DVD three weeks ago and have followed the exercise program and what a difference it has made. I am now able to do so much more and it boosted my moral  which was pretty low before. I did not have any medical success previous to following your program. So thank you very much!",1405296000,12,311,4.098360655737705
6491577,5,B00LMF99TK,"As of a week ago, I was stressed and in pain, not having an answer as to why the right foot under the heel is killing me (level 5-8 out of 10). Even a light walk was out of the question.

Just when I was about to give up all hope I found your DVD. I took a chance and ordered it.

I like the video a lot and just completed my first session. I wanted to thank you for sharing your solution. I feel God has answered my concern, and I hope to be back jogging a the next couple of weeks!

Thanks & God Bless!",1405296000,11,504,3.691588785046729
6491578,2,B00LMF99TK,This video is way overpriced for what it contains. I could have found most if not all of this information on the internet for free. The exercises are too aggresive and made my plantar fasciitis much worse. I can't recommend it.,1439251200,14,227,4.560975609756097
6491579,5,B00LMF99TK,The program worked better than expected. Great !!!!,1437264000,3,51,5.5
6491580,5,B00LMF99TK,"Amazing! This is the best and most helpful. Thank you, Thank you my pain is almost gone...a great program I will continue to use every morning because it works.",1433980800,4,160,4.551724137931035
6491581,4,B00LMF99TK,"Doing the exercises help, but after 14 days straight, when I tried to skip a few days, was right back to where I had been.  With that said, I believe if my feet weren't in such bad shape, this would have worked great.  I AM 75% better now.",1433808000,10,239,3.9583333333333335
6491582,5,B00LMF99TK,If you follow this video you will get rid of your Plantar Fasciitis.  It will be the only thing that works.  If you get the shot for pain from the doctor it won't last.  My mother had 4 shots.  Great video.,1432598400,7,206,3.951219512195122

6491585,5,B00LMF99TK,"After 6 months of failed & expensive orthopedic advice & useless physical rehab I was desperate with pain. This program really works. (Not as quickly as hoped but my case was severe.) Easy to follow instructions and results you can feel in your daily life.

Hint for all who are wise enough to try:
the ice routine may seem unpleasant but makes improvement that much faster. And I hate using ice!  I recommend this program to all who are suffering and not getting results with conventional treatment.",1413849600,14,500,4.735632183908046

6491587,5,B00LMF99TK,"It is very rare these days to find a merchant, individual or anyone to actually do what they advertise they will do. The Plantar Fasciitis Solution DVD does exactly that.",1405382400,8,170,4.7
8666646,4,B00LMF99TK,"After months of braces at night, orthotics,injections and taping,I felt I had nothing to lose with trying this. Best decision I made. Exercises were easy and I agree the icing is a must to help with healing. Didnt always like doing it but it worked. I typed the exercises in my phone so I could wake up and stretch before I ever got out of bed. It was pricy but worth it for me.",1528329600,,378,4.121621621621622
8666647,5,B00LMF99TK,Life saver!,1504656000,,11,5.0
8666648,1,B00LMF99TK,The stretching exercises proposed in this video are easily found by reaseaching ways to improve plantar fasciitis. Charging $49.00 for the DVD is outrageous! I returned mine.,1498694400,,174,5.481481481481482
8666649,2,B00LMF99TK,Over priced!! Simple exercises and icing methods?,1498262400,3,49,6.142857142857143
8666650,5,B00LMF99TK,This is helping my feet after two weeks of use there is a significant reduction in pain,1487721600,4,87,4.176470588235294
8666651,3,B00LMF99TK,I like the icing part of the instructions and that seems to be taking care of the problem.,1487635200,3,90,4.055555555555555
8666652,1,B00LMF99TK,Made my feet hurt worse and could barely walk for days after using this video. My best bet is don't waste your money,1473120000,4,116,4.086956521739131
8666653,5,B00LMF99TK,This DVD has very detailed and thorough exercises and suggestions for treating a plantar fasciitis injury.  Hopefully the exercises will result in faster healing for this injury ... too early to report the results.,1464652800,,214,5.294117647058823
8666654,3,B00LMF99TK,I purchased the video directly from the website rather than amazon. I had found several of the exercises/stretches on line prior to watching the video. The video provide some structure to my routine which was good for me. The exercises have improved my condition and I will continue the routine. That being said I believe the DVD is overpriced. Based on the value I believe a price more in the $25 range would be a fair value. If you have the extra dollars this DVD will probably help improve your condition but I would exhaust internet search for exercises prior to spending the money.,1460764800,6,586,4.644230769230769
8666655,5,B00LMF99TK,"I bought this DVD from a friend. WOW! It works! I had heel pain that was awful. I suffered for a month before i went online for help. A friend of mine said this DVD worked for her - and would i like to buy it from her. I was desperate, so i did. And I'm so glad. I did the entire regimen every morning and before bed every day for a month. I still had pain, so i stopped the icing and substituted warm heat instead. The pain was mostly gone within the next 3 weeks. Then i did the program once a day for a week...all the pain was gone. Sometimes the arch area feels tight or my heels ache, and i do the first 3 or 4 exercises once and the tightness &/or pain is gone, for weeks. I only have to do the exercises once every 5-6 months now. BUT HERE'S ANOTHER THING: i recently developed pain in my knees. It was there for two weeks. I prayed i wouldn't have to have knee surgery. For no other reason than i like the way my feet and legs feel after exercising them, I did the first 3-4 excercises on this video and THE PAIN IN MY KNEES WENT AWAY!!! It came back after driving to town so I did the exercises again...again THE PAIN WENT AWAY! This dvd is well worth much more than the price offered! No doctor bills, no needles, no cutting!",1449014400,3,1235,3.9838709677419355
