7860392,5,6304066155,THE VIDEO TAPE ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION. IT WAS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE IT WORKED PERFECTLY WHEN I PLAYED IT.,1351641600,,107,4.142857142857143
7860393,4,6304066155,"Plot:  The Enterprise is hosting an archeological conference and who is there, but Vash, Picard's romance from Risa (Captain's Holiday-Episode 67).  Well, when Vash find out the captain had never mentioned her to any of the crew members, she gets upset.  Of course, no episode with the letter ""Q"" lacks our irritatingly, lovable (to a certain degree), Q.  Well, he wants to give Picard a thank you gift for his hospitality (DejaQ-Episode 61), but Picard really doesn't want to recieve anything from the unpredictable alien.  Q, who observes how Picard and Vash aren't getting along, warns the captain that emotional love for a woman is dangerous.  Well, Q decides to prove this by sending the entire senior crew and Vash into a fantasy in which Capt. Picard is Robin Hood, Riker is Little John, Worf is Will Scarlet, Vash is the Maid Marian, etc.  Well, Picard either must rescue Vash at the risk of his life and the crew's, or let her be executed (Tough decision).

Well, like the title says, it's probably the most comical of Star Trek: TNG episodes produced.  Plenty of humor, including Geordi's bad playing on the mandolin, Troi being a master (or is it masterette?) at bow and arrow (I say this with irony), etc.  A pretty good episode on the whole.",1157587200,,1254,4.7373271889400925
7860394,5,6304066155,"Any episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation which features the wonderful John DeLancie as the mischievous Q and Jennifer Hetrick as Picard's ""friend"" Vash is bound to be excellent, and this definitely lived up to my expectations.  Picard as Robin Hood!  Data as Friar Tuck!  Yes, an hour well spent!",1031011200,,301,4.862745098039215
7860395,5,6304066155,"As Worf said ...""I am not a Merry Man!"" Q returns with Picard's former love, Vash.  She spent some time with him in another episode about a artifact buried on Risa.  This one has Q in the era of Robin Hood with ....You guessed it Picard as the swashbuckler Robin Hood.  There are quite a few good scenes in this one that make it worth the price of the video. I love the scenes with Data as Little John. It's one of those that can stand repeated viewings and still be enjoyable.  This one must have broke the budget for the year. The costumes and stunts were very much like a Robin Hood movie.",1005264000,,592,4.166666666666667
7860396,4,6304066155,"When the TNG writers add the beloved Q character into the mix, the very idea of taking anything too seriously is thrown out the window, including the oh-so-pensive Captain Picard. In this episode, the crew of the  Enterprise trades in their ever-needing-to-be-strightened unforms for the  feathered caps and earth-tone tights of Robin hood and his Merry Men. Much  fun. Plus, Picard's unpredictable romatic-interest, Vash, is re-introduced.  The Vash-Q combo manages to keep the entire Star-Trek menagerie on their  toes making this one of the best episodes of The Next Generation.",944006400,12,581,5.411111111111111
