8704789,5,B00U9X19AI,"This film which revolves around the gay porn industry and a missing $200,000.00 is a brilliantly conceived mystery thriller that combines supernatural and real elements with just the right touch of erotica, nakedness, and humor. The introductory scene alone which takes place in a graveyard and involves a figure (looking like something out of a scarecrow horror movie) whose head and face are completely covered with burlap material while carrying a dead body is worth the price of admission. (More said here about it would spoil the fun.) Our story then shifts to a porn company in desperate need of cash and an actor willing to ""bottom"" because its star is still recovering from his last bottoming experience. Shortly, a briefcase filled with cash totalling $200thousand arrives and all looks bright.  However, the cash then disappears.  Who is to blame? Where did the money go? Interweaving later scenes with past scenes and including plenty of eye candy, our story unfolds at a quick pace.  One must exercise patience in viewing this DVD (go back if necessary) due to the somewhat convoluted presentation.  But, have no fear. All is explained and appropriately revealed in an unusual progression that goes from the present to the past and on into the future. Glimpses of earlier scenes are fleshed out; there are no unexplained loopholes; plenty of surprises to satisfy any mystery buff; the actors are excellent in their individual roles and eye catching in appearance while performing near hard core sexual activity. (The latter is not so overt and gratuitous to be offputting to some.)  One actor portrays twins which is not made clear enough until late in the film which was somewhat perplexing regarding certain behavior up to that point.  The characters are three dimensional and quite credible - even the supernatural ones. Addison Graham has appeared in a number of films associated with Steven Vasquez (Eroddity(s), Tripple Crossed, among others) as have a number of other actors in Angels...and does a superb job as does Cory Tyndall and Brandon Rife.  The title of this film - ""Angels with Tethered Wings"" - makes complete sense after it has been viewed. The twists and turns made it a real ""Who Dunnit?"" and I would give this movie an A+ for originality and how they pulled it all off. Be sure and watch the Extras.",1434844800,8,2332,4.948849104859335
8704790,4,B00U9X19AI,"Angels With Tethered Wings is a confusing film, but it's still fun because of the occasional campy humor and because of all of the nudity. There are some truly hot guys in this, and most of them are seen fully nude at some point. There's also some violence. This is a fun movie, and I enjoyed it despite the complicated, twisty plot.",1430956800,7,333,4.387096774193548
8704791,5,B00U9X19AI,"If you are a fan of Steven Vasquez films over the past ten years, starting with Sideline Secrets and including the new ErOdditys Series, this new film will be your favorite. Steven combines his style in a totally upgraded fashion of cinematography, acting, sound and storyline. The signature mostly twinkish cast is seen in all their glory throughout this captivating mystery and suspenseful filled, but yet, of course, campy dramedy. It wouldn't be Vasquez if it wasn't campy, and this is what so many reviewers fail to understand when they watch his films. His fane won't be disappointed by this one and, I'm sure, can hardly wait for what's coming!",1430784000,5,651,4.927272727272728
8704792,1,B00U9X19AI,"There is a line  in  one early scene where  a character says 'what's it all about?' That  sums up the film for me. Towards the finale  another character  says 'we're  making this up as we go along.' It seems that the scriptwriter did this as well. This  has to be the most  tedious  gay film I  have seen in  a long , long time. The acting (if you would call it that) is atrocious. Seeing  blue sky and sunlight in the  night scenes , is bad  and very amateurish..There is  absolutely nothing to recommend  in this film .It is  so devoid of anything worthwhile , that I wonder why it was ever made. You have been warned.",1430611200,6,620,4.153846153846154
