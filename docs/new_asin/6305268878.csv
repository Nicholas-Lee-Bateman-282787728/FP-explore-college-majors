1008278,5,6305268878,"Renamed over 3 times, this deeper teenage comedy should've kept the original title ""The Hairy Bird"". You will agree after the first 2 minutes and by the song in the final credits! (You'll also find out what  the ""hairy bird"" stands for). DVD buyers beware: they have  snipped 2 little scenes. 1) Tweety asks Odie if it was beautiful....when he  spent himself inside of you. 2) Verena offers a boy napkins after Tinka  gyratingly dances with him (and he has a natural reaction). But the movie  definitely still stands its own without these very short, but classic  scenes. Still worth buying for its exceptional picture quality...shame  about the miss of 5.1 digital though, but 2.0 is still great. Have fun with  this GREAT, FUN film...Kirsten Dunst is exceptionally terrific!",962064000,3,776,4.961240310077519
1008279,2,6305268878,"Usually I enjoy high school hijinks movies, but this one was vapid.  The story revolves around five girls at an all girls prep school, four of whom have the IQ's of one of Tiger Woods' better rounds of golf.  As usual in  these movies, we are treated to the escapades and mischief cooked up by  bored teens, this time female style.  Unfortunately, most of the skits were  woefully unfunny and stereotyped.
As the movie progresses, we learn  that, out of financial need, the school intends to merge with a local boys'  school and go coed.  The girls try to sabotage the plan with a plot at the  next mixer to make the boys look like drunks and perverts.  When that  fails, the film starts taking itself very seriously and the girls organize  a student strike and lock themselves in the dorm demanding the right to  vote against the merger.
The direction of this film by writer/director  Sarah Kernochan was uninspiring.  Other than some decent sixties props it  was pretty insipid.  Kernochan made a splash as the co-writer of `9   Weeks' and `Sommersby', but as a solo writer/director she just doesn't cut  it.
The acting; well, there really wasn't any acting.  Other than Lynn  Redgrave, who was far too melodramatic for this film, all we had here was a  bunch of pubescent teens behaving sillily.  The only serious teenage  character in the film was Odette (Gaby Hoffman) and she was far too dour  and condescending.
This movie is pretty much a disaster.  It had a couple  of funny moments but they were far too sparse.  I gave it a 3/10.  I would  only recommend it to girls 10 to 18 years old, or to anyone else who needs  a 90 minute nap.",961804800,,1643,4.536082474226804
1008280,5,6305268878,"""Strike!"" [All I wanna do](1998) has had a hard life, but is a good teen comedy about a girl's school from the perspective of fairly sophisticated girls and deserves a larger audience.  The original title for  this film was ""The Hairy Bird."" Miramax purchased distribution  rights, changed the name to ""Strike!,"" failed to advertise it,  and then gave it a very short run in a limited U.S. release before moving  on to other countries. The movie, under the new but equally unhelpful title  ""All I wanna do,"" was rereleased this year in New York and went  on sale last week as a new DVD.
The story follows students combating a  threatened merger with a boy's school. What makes it worthwhile is the  principal cast (Lyn Redgrave, Kirsten Dunst, Rachel Leigh Cook, Gaby  Hoffman), some of the dialogue, and the point of view. Sarah Kernochan  received full support from her team of actresses for a warm heartfelt  comedy about smart independent women keeping control over their own lives.  Insofar as she kept to the conversations between the girls and the  headmistress, it all rang true.  The portrayal of teenage male townies in  the film, however, is excruciatingly bad, and Kernochan made Redgrave's  headmistress too ineffectual for my taste. Excepting these two elements, it  all worked well. ""All I wanna do"" offers a unique comic take on  women who make their own way in the world and don't take compromise for  granted.",961113600,3,1427,4.866666666666666

1008696,4,6305268878,"my review from Flixster:

excellent payoff
it doesn't really get to the actual point of the plot until the 3rd act
but the 1st two reels actually does a good job portraying these women as real people and very dependable characters
it's another inspiring female-empowerment story
a great amount of heart, humor, and speaking up for your rights can relate to so many women who want strong female role models
Im no woman but I really admire the strength of these women standing up for what they believe in and their demand for equal rights involving gender and roles in society
seriously, when it comes to merging single-sex schools that becomes a very topical situation and in this movie it's addressed to great degree
they reach for the political commentary which manages to make the film very watchable and very entertaining nonetheless
a must-see for all!",1295308800,,856,4.863013698630137

He was so amazing he had some of the weirdest lines ever! But he delivered them in a way that made them positively intoxicating!

Boy was i wrong! I hated it. I think all this movie had to do with was sex and drugs/alchohal. As for the rating, PG-13, this movie is definitely an 'R'. The message this is giving the kids is to go have fun, make out, and have sex and get kicked out of school because of it. I would give this movie a zero if I could. Kirstin Dunst I give you a 5, but this movie I give a zero. Don't watch it, it's repulsive!",1147392000,5,588,3.8278688524590163
1008813,5,6305268878,"""All I Wanna Do"" is a hilarious teen comedy with memorable characters, original screenplay, and priceless jokes.  Unlike most current teen comedies (with the exception perhaps of ""Orange County""), this movie does not rely on gross humor or stereotypical characters and predictable love stories and plots.  For those who do like that stuff, there is still a lot of vomiting, smoking and hormones in the movie, but they're all done in a clever, realistic and very funny way.

Kirsten Dunst is excellent in the movie, showing off her comedic style.  Verena, Dunst's character, is not only the most ambitious and most conniving, but she is also the most attrative of the girls and has insecurities.  Definitely a step up from the usual teen movie female character.  Also, the main guy character, ""Snake,"" likewise has a personality, compared the meatheads of the usual teen flick.  He is in love with Tinka, and he has a strong group of funny sidekicks who all share a strong interest in photographing dead animals.  (Trust me, it works.)

Interestingly, the movie is not only completely hilarious, but also has good messages.  For example, girls should date nice guys!!  Don't even consider the jerks (the private school guys the girls prevent from entering their school).  Also, it's completely okay for girls to support each other, not be backstabbing, and to have dreams and goals beyond their appearance and finding a date.  And the photographing interests of the nice versus bad guys is actually very revealing.

A definite must see!",1147392000,10,1535,5.015810276679842
1008814,3,6305268878,"All I Wanna Do was a great and funny movie.  Our story begins in early 1963, where a Motor-City Maiden named Odette Sinclair(Gabby Hoffman) is determined to lose her virginity, until her mother catches her with a birth-control device and ships her and her horse off to Miss Goddard's School for Girls, an all-girls boarding school, supposedly in Connecticut which she think is ""surrounded by high walls and lesbians.""

The girls take place in countless adventures and mis-adventures, determined to get what they want and find ways around the school rules. They have an amazingly tight friendship and find fun and trouble in almost every situation. However, when they find out that they're school is merging with a boys boarding school, they have mixed feelings, but attempt to pull off their craziest scheme yet.

The acting was great, it was full of timely AND timeless humor, and is a fun, feel-good movie. The more I watch it, the more funny moments I find hidden in. It probably won't be the best movie you'll ever see, but it's something everyone (especially teen girls) will enjoy.",1145577600,3,1087,4.896739130434782

1008816,5,6305268878,"Most teen comedies nowadays are so mindless, unfunny, and unrealistic that they aren't even worth watching. Although this movie is pure ""chick flick"", it's nothing like today's teen-sex comedies starring Chad Michael Murray, Lindsay Lohan, and Hilary Duff.

""All I Wanna Do"", set in the early sixties, tells the story of Odette Sinclair, who is sent to an all-girls boarding school after her parents discover her plans to have sex with her boyfriend. Though reluctant at first, Odette befriends the school's biggest troublemakers, Verena, Tinka, Tweety, and Momo. They have their share of adventures with the boys, their classmates, and their teachers. But the girls aren't prissy--they're smart, sassy, funny, and ambitious, and when they find out that their school is merging with an all-boys academy, they pull off their biggest heist yet.

The acting in ""All I Wanna Do"" is brilliant; the writing is smart, funny, and filled with political humor of the 60s; the characters are real; and, the movie is funny, sexy, and memorable. It's a level above the standard teen-sex romps, more mature but still fun for younger and older teens. You can watch it again and again over the years and find something new with each viewing--""All I Wanna Do"" is definitely worth your time.",1115251200,15,1273,5.057142857142857

The soundtrack is also really nice, though I don't think they sell it, they had it available on the films website before, but they've since taken the website down.

1008909,5,6305268878,"ALL I WANNA DO (which is also known as THE HAIRY BIRD) is a loving and hilarious look at the swinging 60's, featuring an impressive script and direction by Sarah Kernochan and a capable, strong cast.
Odette (Gaby Hoffmann) has just been shipped to Conneticut and Miss Godard's School for Girls.  Run by the kindly Miss McVane (Lynn Redgrave - GODS AND MONSTERS) the school is a sanctuary for the girls who will have to take a second place to men when they eventually have to leave and go into the real world.
Odette falls into the outsiders group known as the Daughters of the American Ravioli - trouble-making Verena (Kirsten Dunst), brainy Momo (Merritt Wever), sex-hungry Tinka (Monica Keena) and the almost-pathelogical Tweety (Heather Matarazzo).
When Tweety accidentally discovers the plan to merge Miss Godard's with a neighboring boy's college, they put a huge and potentially dangerous plan into action to get rid of the ""hairy bird""...
A clever and canny comedy filled with superb performances.  Standouts in the cast include the wonderful Heather Matarazzo and the fantastic Monica Keena.  The film also features Rachael Leigh Cook and Rosemary Dunsmore (ANNE OF AVONLEA).",1017100800,24,1183,5.087628865979381

The acting was very good from all the cast (the young boys did very good drunk impressions :) ). The costumes and hair were correct for the era (as you can see from the cover). I noticed one error when they were talking about the Beatles (1963 remember).
The DVD (in Australia at least) had a good picture and sound. The extras include interviews with the cast and director/writer and a making of. Does the US edition have this? It's not mentioned.

1008911,5,6305268878,"Interestingly, this movie takes place the same year that Betty Friedan wrote ""The Feminine Mystique"".
 It begins in early 1963 when one Odette Sinclair, played by a rebellious but very charismatic Gaby Hoffman, is taken from her home in Michigan, horse in tow, to the Miss Godard's School for Girls in Connecticut by irate parents after she is caught planning a tryst with her boyfriend, Dennis (a still-slightly boyish Matthew Lawrence).
 At first, she resents the change of atmosphere. But the solemn, tremulous girl soon finds companionship with a group of girls, who, although they can be antagonistic, encourage her to find other aspirations beyond having sex with her boyfriend. These include her two luminescent blonde roomates, the sexually mature Tinka,whose favorite colors to wear when she's out of uniform are red and black, and the ever-scheming Verena, deftly played by Monica Keena and Kirsten Dunst respectively.
 Heather Matarazzo's bulimic Tweety is a rather weak-willed character, and Merrit Wever's Momo is strong and smart. Together, these girls form a secret organization called The Daughters of the American Ravioli, in which they pledge to help each other acheive their goals. One of the more immediate ones is to rid the school of their lecherous teacher Mr. Dewey, to whom his portrayer, Robert Bockstael, gives such understated underhandedness. At a time when sex crimes against students at the hands of teachers may have been underreported due to the fact that the teachers most likely would have gotten off, this makes an interesting subplot.
 But 1963 was the beginning of the modern feminist movement, and these girls take matters into their own hands after the Board of Trustees threatens to merge the school with the St. Ambrose Boys Academy without giving the students any say in the matter. Using every non-violent rescource they have to gain the attention of authority figures, they ultimately help to bail their school out of the financial troubles that led to the decision to merge with the Boys' Academy, and we watch these girls assert themselves and find their voices in a way that might have been more unusual in 1963 than it would be today.
 Lynn Redgrave leads the cast as the prudish but sympathetic headmistress of Miss Godard's with a very accurate New England accent (Notice how the statue of the school's foundress looks like her).  What struck me about her appearance was mainly her outdated hairdo. The soft-spoken Abby Sawyer, portrayed by Rachel Leigh Cook, is the hall monitor and school legacy who takes a surpising(or perhaps not-so-surprising) turn. Rosemary Dunsmore is Abby's controlling and rather narrow-minded mother who, with her husband, serves on the Board of Trustees. Her role as Mrs. Sawyer is more than faintly reminiscent of her role in ""Anne of Avonlea"" in which she played another staff member at a girls' academy.
 The party scene was fun to watch. It's interesting, though, how the only minority boy and the only minority boy and girl were paired off, which is how it most likely would have been done in 1963 to avoid complaints from the parents. The music is lively, the rowdy townies come in handy when it comes to putting the girls' tormentors in their place, the dresses and hairdos had a certain elegance and grace, and the cast members were talented and attractive, including the radiant Barbara Radecki and Phobe Lapine as Tinka's mom and sister.
 Ultimately, this film is a bouncy 90-minute romp through the early modern feminist era which harmlessly pays homage to girl power. I feel upbeat and inspired after watching it!",1011744000,11,3605,5.047058823529412

1009003,5,6305268878,"I think that this movie hits on more important issues that took place in our past. The movie, which took place in the 1960's at a time when feminism was a nonexistant thing and men controlled and ordered women. Ms. Goddard's school is an all girls school where most of the students who attend there want it to be integrated with boys. Soon do the girls learn that it was not what they were looking for and seek some justice for the all girl school. Liberating and amazing in all shape and form it is truly a movie not to pass over.",997660800,,531,4.215686274509804

This movie still can be enjoyed by others. Just not me. I almost fell asleep watching it.",994896000,2,247,4.511111111111111
1009005,4,6305268878,"This absolutely hilarious movie, set in 1963, is about a girl who is kicked out of her school and is sent to Miss Godard's, a private school for girls. At the beginning, Odie, the main character, absolutely hates the school and does not want to be a part of it. However, life goes on and Odie realizes that her roomates and their friends are actually a lot like her, and they become good friends. After becoming a member of the DAR (Daughters of the American Ravioli- i love that name!), Odie realizes her real goal in life, not to meet up with her boyfriend and ""have a little fun"", but to become a lawyer and do something with her life. My friends and I absolutely LOVED this Kirsten Dunst and Rachael Leigh Cook movie, and we will be forever murmuring ""up your ziggy with a wa wa brush"" to each other in study halls. A great comedy for teenage girls (but inappropriate for anyone under the age of 13- maybe OK for mature 12 year old- because of some sexual business) but nonetheless aboslutely hilarious. Great for the independent girl!",990748800,5,1039,4.473684210526316

I especially liked the part at the dance when the girls get the guys drunk! It was a trip... I personally liked that movie SOOOOOO Much!! 5 stars!!,983318400,,454,4.101123595505618
1009007,5,6305268878,"This is a great movie for the simple reasons. It lacks any type of thought and brings on a big source of laughter. The first time I rented It I watched it over 3 times and thought it was hilarious. When I rented it a second time with my sister and friends we all ended up laughing so hard we were crying and re-winding to the funny parts. It's one of those movies you get something out of every time you watch it, you see things you didn't see before and laugh at parts you didn't laugh at before. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone older then twelve, because It is very volgur for anyone younger. If you like this movie I would also recommend Ferris Buellers day off, Clueless and Dick. With my last words all I have to say is my friends and my most favorite movie qwote, ""FLAT CRITTERS""",979516800,,803,4.220779220779221
1009008,5,6305268878,"When my friend's older sister came back from the video store with ""All I Wanna Do"", I thought, ""Great another chick flick teenie bopper movie...yawn!"" This was about the 5th movie we had rented that week, and I was ready for the long haul. We popped in the tape, and just about half-way into it, we realized that our faces hurt we were laughing so much! We decided to watch it again that night, and she watched it a third time after I left. By the forth time we saw it, we had most parts memorized, and we were still laughing. Each time we watch it, we find funnier parts, and we have to keep rewinding the tape to squeeze all th humor out of the movie. I think we've seen it about 7 or 8 times and we still laugh and look forward to renting it. arghingly enough, our video store only has one copy so it is VERY hard to rent it. But we are saving up our moolah so we can buy it! Also, this movie is not only funny, but it also has a strong message in it, showing that girls do not need to depend on guys. The DAR is a great example of (i hate to say this....) ""girl power""  (oy vey how valley girlish). You have to see this movie! And if you  don't agree, I have one thing to say to you: UP YOUR ZIGGY WITH A WAA WAA BRUSH!!! (from the movie) some good quotes from the movie: ""Is that how people fall in love in your world-they're introduced? How sad, how tragic, people like that are (snap) FLAT CRITTERS!!""  ""Maybe we could scoop it in with a spoon"" ""Miss Godard's Girls are very organized!"" ""But we, the DAR have other plans for ourselves"" and much MUCH MUCH more!!

1009009,3,6305268878,"The movie is utterly predictable.  You KNOW that Hoffman's character will take the lead in the students' rebellion against the trustees; you KNOW  Cook's character will shed her weenie past to join the rebellion as soon as  she feels safe; you KNOW Keena's character will fall for the Flat Critter  member who keeps pursuing her...etc etc etc.  I do have to give the film  credit where credit is due; even though they cast the winning Kirsten  Dunst, the elfin Rachael Leigh Cook, and the buxom Gaby Hoffman in lead  roles, they also cast the doggy Heather Matarazzo and the tomboyish Merritt  Weaver.
The movie consists mostly of Keena looking cute, Dunst acting  rebellious and making smart-assed comments, Hoffman looking bemused (or  flatulent), and Cook looking horrified.  It's entertaining enough, but the  plot is VERY uneven and the talent of these actress cannot save the  tissue-thin script.",966124800,,902,5.089041095890411
1009010,4,6305268878,"I had been looking forward to this film since August 1998 when I saw a little blurb about it in a teen magazine.  I couldn't wait to see it in theaters.  Unfortunately, it never arrived in theaters here in Portland,  and I didn't get to see it until just recently, on video.  I guess waiting  that long made me have unrealistic expectations for this movie.  I thought  it would be the best movie EVER or something.  It's not . . . but it's  still pretty good.  ""All I Wanna Do"" is the story of a group of  girls at a prep school who try to keep the school from going co-ed.  Heather Matarazzo and Rachel Leigh Cook are both hilarious in this film,  and Kirsten Dunst shines, as usual.  There's some sexual innuendo in here  that probably isn't appropriate for anyone under 13, hence the PG-13  rating.  And the movie is free of action, suspense, or really a lot of  plot.  Still, the film's young actors and actresses save the film and make  it watchable and worthwhile.  Some parts are funny, some will make you  think.  Not a bad movie at all.",963619200,10,1045,4.328125
