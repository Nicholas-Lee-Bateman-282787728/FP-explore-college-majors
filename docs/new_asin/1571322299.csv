7797408,3,1571322299,"I thought I had ordered 2 different movies from grounding Marsh, but 2 copies of the same movie.  Very disappointing for my grandchild, but althought I 'thought' I had 2 different movies coming both were the same.  I just gave it to him explaining I was sorry.  Lots of confusion over my payment for them.  I had a new account, and they assumed I had the same one and kept cancelling my transaction while going back to the original account although I had entered the correct information.  I was disappointed with the entire process.  Sorry, but when it comes to Grandchildren most grandparents feel the same as I do about disappointing them.",1427328000,,641,4.678571428571429
