2326393,2,B0009W5KJK,"I'm giving this one two stars - but one of those stars is for POTENTIAL.  Not that the same team could do it better, but it actually seems to me that this one would actually make for a good Hollywood film (if rewritten and recast).  OK - I know that sounds like a whole new movie.  But, actually, this one does actually have some good moments.  And the acting, in parts, is amateurish enough that is almost seems believable.  As far as an OTS (off the shelf, as in video store) horror flick, this one wasn't as terrible as some of the reviewers might lead you to believe, at least in my opinion.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125187200,3,850,4.209876543209877

2326395,5,B0009W5KJK,"There is a glut of horror films out there right now. Most are remakes or rehashes aimed at getting teenagers cash. The Off Season is a refreshing break from this trend, smartly written and with real characters.

The horror here works on two levels: First there are some real ""scares"". I saw this as part of a Halloween double feature with Phantasm (also featuring Angus Scrimm who was in attendance). Despite the film's understated tone and presentation, even the most desensitized horror fans were leaping out of their seats on several occasions.

Secondly, the film looks at the fear we as social creatures have of being alone in a strange place.

The humor that was present in the director's first film, Canniballistic, is here as well. But there is also a great deal of sadness, thanks to some excellent writing and an amazing performance by the film's leading lady, Christina Campenella.

The Of Season isn't just a wonderful horror movie, but and excellent drama, and sometimes comedy, as well.",1122336000,7,1000,4.899408284023669

My wife and I watched it and laughed through all the whole thing. One scene comes to mind. Inside the motel room you can see it's pouring rain and the male lead goes outside and there's no rain in sight, but, you can still hear the pouring rain.

While almost succesful in doing this ""The Off Season"" falls a little short.  When watching low-budget films I can usually forgive bad acting, but Don Wood is terrible.  His performance is so distracting that it's a welcome relief whe his character leaves the story.

2326439,4,B0009W5KJK,"James Felix McKenney's ""The Off Season"" gives one a glimpse at his unquestionable genius.  His ability to lead the viewer gently through this ghostly tale of intrique and heartbreak is a refreshing change from the violence that is so pervasive in tales of horror.

Christina Campanella gives an oscar worthy performance as Kathryn, an attractive woman whose patient reserve proves to be the catalyst to her ultimate success, while putting closure on her life's past.

Playwright Rick's(Don Wood)aspirations of fame are the driving force behind the solace he and Kathryn seek in Maine.  Emotional torment forces him to put his writing, as well as his relationship with Kathryn, on hold.  He implodes, leaving a void where there was once a man.

The hauntings these two experience expose their strengths and weaknesses with surprisingly different outcomes.

Mckenney's sense of humor is glaringly evident in his character Claudette(Francine Pado).  She fulfills one's expectation of typically ""sexless"" librarians beautifully.  Possessing a tall, thin frame, disproportionately long arms and a propensity to wear the same dress day after day(compared with Campenella's wardrobe changes), her presence was fraught with humor and had me wondering if Popeye was missing his girlfriend Olive Oyl.

McKenney struck gold when casting Ruth Kulerman as ""The Viking Motel's"" proprietress, Mrs. Farthing.  Kulerman paints an almost caricature portrait of a ""colorful"" personality who has a stake in the lives of all around her.

Phil(Larry Fessenden)is strange but likeable.  One's perception of a man consumed with too much time on his hands, while holding a beer in them, is thwarted when his theatrical talents are made known.  His ability to let the ""bird"" fly for five minutes was as humorously odd as his relationship with the much younger Stacy(Jamie Sneider), the motel's housekeeper.

The character of rodeo wrangler Ted(Angus Scrimm)is wonderfully sane and greatly appreciated, as he answers the questions this movie has one asking.

""The truth must come out""...James Felix McKenney's talents merged brilliantly to create a fabulous ghost story that delivers plenty of heart racing fright, while refusing to insult the viewer's intelligence.",1138060800,3,2239,5.48396501457726
2326440,2,B0009W5KJK,"And neither, really, do good intentions.  Regardless of how little money the filmmakers had and how little time to shoot, this is simply not a good movie.  Budget and time constraints do not excuse poor plotting, bad acting and generally unimaginative direction.

The story - what there is of it - involves a couple who are renting a motel for an extended stay in Maine.  After discovering someone's left quite a mess in the bathroom of the original room they were to stay in, they're moved to a different room.  One that has secrets, causes nightmares and mood swings, where the telephone receives calls from VERY long distance.  You know, it's haunted.

Underneath all of the poor execution, there's a decent film - maybe even a good one - trying to be made from this concept.  Unfortunately it remains buried.  The first thing noticeable in the story is the uniformly bad, BAD acting.  The only person who turns in even a reasoanble perfomance is our lead actress.  Everyone else is way below par, the lead actor especially.  You'll also notice a script that isn't complete enough for a feature length film without having some pretty mundane moments extended for several seconds to pad the running time (how long was that one guy planning on giving the old landlady the finger?) which of course ruins the pacing.  In fact the development of the story shows evidence of pretty awful timing.  Questions about who's haunting the motel and why aren't really even raised until about the last 3rd of the movie, and the answers are then rushed on us as well.  Dialogue is fairly tedious and at times outright horrible.

Still, there are a few inspired moments.  The first dream sequence was somewhat eerie and had me thinking that this could be a decent film after all.  Likewise the first phone call from beyond the grave, which includes a simple but great answer to a question of ""What's your problem?""

All things considered, as I've said before about other low budget horror flicks (i.e., Malevolence) having your heart in the right place doesn't make it okay for your movie to be no good.  And nowadays, especially after having seen what could be accomplished with just $7000 in Primer, the ""low budget"" excuse is wearing pretty thin.  This film's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it hardly qualifies as good.",1131321600,4,2317,4.756892230576441

2326443,3,B0009W5KJK,"'The Off Season' impressed me with how much the cast and crew was able to do with an obviously limited budget. Set primarily in a Maine hotel room (#13), this unsettling and claustrophobic film builds steadily.

  The leads are quite good - Christina Campenella is wonderful as is Don Wood as the couple who moves into the hotel room looking for some peace and quiet --- and who find something quite different. It was nice seeing Angus Scrimm (Phantasm) in a new role as well. He has a good time as neighbor Ted. Ruth Kulerman is disarmingly real as the landlady Mrs. Garthing.

  The script is intelligent and makes the pain, confusion, and unease of the characters palpable. Because of the solid nature of the screenplay and acting by people who can act rather than by people whose performances are edited into passability, the movie doesn't need to rely on the Hollywood answer to all - FX!

  This welcome change of pace horror flick also offered plenty of surprises along the way. But who designed the DVD box?  Did they even see the movie?",1125878400,,1045,4.630434782608695

If you're in the mood for a good, atmospheric ghost tale, you'll be very pleased.  The mood is much more like Carnival of Souls - very eerie with people's lives slowly uravelling because of the ghosts.  The performances were much better than one would expect from a straight to dvd horror flick. One scene in particular took me by surprise, with Ruth Kulerman as the landlady explaining some of the sad history of the hotel.  That was flat out Oscar worthy.  The Off Season won't replace The Changeling as my all time favorite ghost movie, but it was worth the money.",1125878400,2,669,4.6752136752136755
2326445,4,B0009W5KJK,"First off, allow me to address some of the complaints other reviewers have had about this film.  A film is not a piece of crap just because it has a microscopic budget.  And for those who think the production values on this film were crap, they obviously don't realize how much bang the equally microscopic crew got out of their buck.  Honestly, if this is the worst film they've ever seen, they need to stop being wowed by the smoke and mirrors of Hollywood and start looking at how well this film achieved what it wanted to achieve.  Get some perspective, folks!

The Off Season itself is a nice bit of a well-executed ghost story. It is a story, first and foremost.  If you're not into watching a story with effectively drawn and well-layered characters, or into listening carefully to important dialogue, or watching subtle actions unfold, this is not the story for you.

And it is a ghost story, not in the Gothic vein with overt monsters and shock horror, but rather in the style of master ghost-story-writer JS LeFanu . (If you don't know who he is and consider yourself educated in the history of horror, you need to go further back than The Shining.) The events of the story can be interpreted many ways-as supernatural influence, as psychological manifestations, or as a combination of the two.  The Off Season is quiet to the point of being eerie and the focus is not on the source of the horror, but rather on the effects of evil on two people struggling to figure out their lives.

The Off Season also requires viewers to be somewhat literate in listening and observing details of performances.  Woven into the mundane daily actions of the characters are a lot of clues about their descent into evil.  But a viewer has to watch and listen carefully.  The two central actors do a convincing job of keeping those clues clear without beating the viewer over the head with them, while nailing their pivotal scenes.  It is in those details, combined with the occasional injection of the supernatural that keeps it moving steadily to its satisfying conclusion.  Add to that the charming and compassionate performances of veterans Angus Scrimm and Brenda Cooney and you have a fine sense of variation and pacing.

My only significant complaint after my first viewing is that the backstory of the ghostly evil came late in the film and unfolded a little too fast for me to keep up.  But on a second viewing, it was all there.

If the Off Season wanted to be a well-written and nicely executed ghost story that doesn't condescend or insult the viewer's intelligence, it succeeded-even on a micro-budget.  But if you like your micro-budget horror with lots of jump scenes and obvious, overblown effects. . . this isn't the film for you.  But if you like your horror more internal and with some actual substance, give The Off Season a fair shake.

And, yes. . the box art doesn't reflect the story or style of this film at all.",1125619200,2,2929,4.650485436893204
2326446,1,B0009W5KJK,"Very slow, boring movie. It's more about the couple's relationship than anything else. Low budget is obvious and bad acting.  The landlord couldn't even get her lines out right.  Film appeared to be low quality.

Movie just sucked.  It seems Lions Gate has many horror titles like this and they are all horrible.  At least there wasn't a five minute lesbian scene in this one (see Slaughterhouse Massacre)

8067879,1,B0009W5KJK,"This is one of the most unbelievably poor attempts at a movie that ever I have seen, at least among those which attained public release, the more so on DVD, at that! You've heard of haunted houses, right? Try an haunted motel room. Yeah, it does not make the grade! The movie is very poorly paced, atop its visual limitations (poorly filmed, anyway). There are reams of non-sequiturs in the plot and in its many visual gaffs, too, what (politely in this case) would be called ""bad continuity"". This is not even a low-budget horror film of passable quality; ""The Off Season"" is certainly not ""film noir"", as some have labelled this product; it is ""film scum"".

However, if one seeks a movie to play on the DVD player as a ""party film"" (i.e., one to laugh at, from its relentless amateurishness, when one has company over), this is it! I and friends watched this one twice holding our sides roaring with mirth. Then I gave away the DVD as a mock birthday present to one of them (and then gave him the real gift afterwards!), to the unmitigated laughter of all at his party.

For all of that, ""The Off Season"" goes on much too long, with (among all of its other shoddy ingredients) too many side-plots and rambling toll of incidents of tiresomely little consequence, to sustain its feeble substance. Thus it is likely, after a lot of ""yucks"", simply to put you and your pals to sleep.",1415318400,,1381,4.52

I'm one of those people that watches movies over and over and over to pick up the quirks. I'm a nut for locations as well - this one was shot in Maine. This is a low-budget film to be sure, but it's got that creepy ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" thing going for it. Isolation, small town, creepy happenings, odd characters - it's all very real in a surreal kind of way. No blood and gore - just creepy.

Off course this being the kind of movie that it is, strange things soon begin happening. It turns out that the hotel room is haunted and it begin to drive the couple both insane and apart.

I think the best way to describe this movie is boring, it have boring characters, boring plot, boring acting and is filmed in boring locations, the dialog is boring, everything is just so mediocre. I found myself checking several times while watching how much off the movie was left for I just tired of it. There is only one thing which sames The Off Season from one star and that is that it at leasts attempts for originality, the movie also try to play more on mood and characters than shock effects, to bad it falls completely flat at the attempt, however I will give the movie a start for at least trying.

There are so many haunted locations movies out there, some of them good and some of them horrible, I do not see why anyone would want to bother with this mediocre film unless it was the only horror movie left they had not seen at the video store.

8067885,1,B0009W5KJK,"I was thrilled when this movie began as the car approached the center of Old Orchard Beach in the rain. Oh how it brought back memories of going there in EXCITEMENT as a youth some 50 years ago.  Anyone else remember the Noah's Ark fun house?  Or beneath it, the donkey ride that led you through the 7 Dwarves Diamond Mine?  Returned there two summers ago and found the beach as PRISTINE WHITE as I recalled it.  The CRYSTAL CLEAR water of the Atlantic ocean was the same as well.  Thank you Jesus, Old Orchard clam cakes were still a DELIGHTFUL experience for one's taste buds.

Oh.... this film.  It was fully DULL, DREARILY DARK, DANKLY DIRTY and DISTASTEFUL.

I decided to watch the movie anyway, not having much else to do, and in the end can't say that I was all that spooked, let alone entertained.  The whole concept and structure of the movie isn't all that bad, but the script, acting (for the most part), and the production leave much to be desired.

8067887,3,B0009W5KJK,"This movie has a loveably amateurish quality. The actors lag along some of their lines, trying to maintain momentum through the bad pacing that's imposed on them. The action is riddled with horror movie clichs that echo The Shining or Psycho.

There's the clich of the movie's premise itself. A young couple takes up residence in a small-town resort motel during the off-season so that the man can have the quiet he needs to work on his play. There's the clich of the man's assurances that he's progressing with his writing, when in fact something else is going on with him. There's the clich of the tension over what sort of assault the woman is going to face as she takes a shower.

In spite of these flaws though, I enjoyed the movie and would give it a mild recommendation. It has some genuinely spooky moments. But it's main success lies in its characters. The film is populated by some people with memorable personalities who really talk to each other. This makes it a lot more interesting than most of the slick, strictly action-packed major movie productions.

The elderly, slightly doddering motel owner won me over with her heartfelt regret at having supplied the couple with a stain-prone mattress for their unit. And the eccentric retired rodeo rider in the next unit is equally winning.

Actor Angus Scrimm (could that be his real name?), who plays the retired rodeo rider, brought his own unique contribution to the movie. He wrote the song he sings in nostalgia over his days on the circuit out West. Mr. Scrimm sings a snatch of this song in the movie itself. But we are treated to his full rendition in the DVD's Bonus Materials.

Listen to this last part of the ""Making of Off Season"" at your own risk. Mr. Scrimm's song is so irresistible, you won't be able to get it out of your head. He came up with a gem - a song that pokes fun at the cowboy mystique at the same time that it expresses a sincere enthusiasm for some of the off-beat pleasures to be found on the open range. There's a twist on ""going Brokeback"" here. When the singer's Mary is away from him in Tucumcari, he makes do. He kisses him ""a prairie dog or two.""

Those cute little prairie dogs will haunt you as much as the ghosts that inhabit the off-season motel.",1155859200,7,2247,4.522167487684729
