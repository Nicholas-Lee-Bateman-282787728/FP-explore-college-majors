But even if you aren't familiar with Lum and Abner, I believe you will enjoy their down home brand of comedy.",1384300800,,302,4.016666666666667

.
The rural-flavored Lum and Abner radio program aired from 1932 to '54. Co'lum'bus Edwards and Abner Peabody were proprietors of the Jot 'em Down Store, in mythical Pine Ridge, Arkansas. Because of the 15-minute show's popularity, the town of Waters, AK was renamed Pine Ridge in 1936. The L&A franchise became a film series in 1940, with seven programmers in all issued-- THE BASHFUL BACHELOR was their second entry.

SYNOPSIS--
Abner trades the Jot 'em Down's delivery truck for a racehorse and runs it against a nag owned by a hated business rival. Lum writes a marriage proposal note for Geraldine, but the Widder Abernathy gets it by mistake.
