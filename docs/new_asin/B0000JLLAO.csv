8002331,5,B0000JLLAO,"harsh movies. some very innocent guys try to have a wild night on the town and end up going through hell. great exploitation style flick. nice character development makes the brutality all the more brutal. The series strongest entry seems to be the first. after that it loses its original vision and feel. Still worth watching to see what else the poor survivor can be put through. each entry seems to lose budget, vision, and acting quality. Strong as it gets start though.",1461369600,,474,4.72289156626506
8002332,4,B0000JLLAO,"A good box set of part 1 to 3. I enjoyed the stories even though I've only watched 1 & 2. I'm sure 3 will be good but just haven't had the time to watch it. This is a collection of young adults just going amok with no care in the world. The plots were good enough to keep me interested, cause I hate stories with no plot, no rhyme or reason to there madness. Plenty of blood and gore to last you ALL NIGHT LONG.",1421020800,,411,3.7906976744186047
8002333,4,B0000JLLAO,"The ""All Night Long"" collection is just like it sounds:  It's the first three* ""All Night Long"" movies on DVD!

""All Night Long"" is about a group of high school students that become friends after witnessing a vicious assault.  When they decide to have a party, the evening goes downhill fast, and the three boys go on a quest for revenge.

""All Night Long 2"" is about a shy nerd with a dark secret who gets manipulated and brutalized by a sadistic juvenile gang.

""All Night Long 3:  The Final Atrocity"" is about a strange plant-loving nerd who becomes obsessed with a woman who works at a grocery store.

""All Night Long"" and the first sequel are great movies in which virtually none of the characters have a moral compass of any kind.  ""All Night Long 3"" is not so good, a bit over-the-top, and overstays its welcome pretty quickly.  However, I highly recommend all three films to those who have a strong stomach and penchants for extreme films!

The biggest downside to this collection, however, is the complete lack of special features pertaining to these films.  Sure, there are movie trailers for films such as ""Visitor Q"" (?!) that begin after you pop in the DVD, but other than that, there's nothing.  No featurettes, no documentaries, no liner-notes, no TV spots:  Nothing.  Which is a shame, especially when you consider how popular these films became in Japan.

NOTE:  All three ""All Night Long"" films contain graphic violence, graphic language, heterosexual rape scenes, homosexual rape scenes, scenes of child molestation, nudity, and other abhorrent things.  Viewer discretion is advised.

*=There are actually six ""All Night Long"" films;  the ""All Night Long"" collection contains only the first three entries in the series.  Which is for the best, really, since ""All Night Long 4""-""All Night Long 6"" are not nearly as good as the first three films in the series.",1384819200,3,1877,4.8427672955974845
8002334,3,B0000JLLAO,"The ""All Night Long"" films are pure exploitation cinema.  Cheap thrills shot on digital video featuring (mostly) amateur actors, they are churned out low-plot adventures in rape and murder, Japanese style.  Think of these as direct-to-video Z-Grade Slasher flicks that you find in the US.  They have never gotten a theatrical release, and 99.9999% of the Japanese population has never heard of them and wouldn't even know they exist.  These are for exploitation fans only.

Director Matsumura Katsuya has made his whole career on the ""All Night Long"" films.  There are currently six in the series, with the most recent one (All Night Long: Anyone Would Have Done) released in 2009.  The delve more into psychology and sadomasochism than your average Slasher flick; don't expect buckets of blood or reams of nudity, although there is some of each.  Matsumura is more interested in exploring obsession and attacker/victim power exchanges.

There first three ""All Night Long"" films are in this collection, ""All Night Long (1992),"" ""Atrocity (1995),"" and ""Final Atrocity (1996).""  The films have no connection other than the aforementioned themes. The stories try to frame real events, like a man going on a revenge spree after his girlfriend is raped and murdered, or a mentally challenged man who obsesses over a neighbor, but ultimately the stories don't have much depth and are just playing with taboos and darkness.

It is hard recommend this flicks. These three DVDs are not a bad little box of blood. They have none of the brilliance of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ichi-the-Killer/dp/B0000CABGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ichi the Killer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B003HIC564/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>.  Keep your expectations low.

If you are an exploitation fan, you will find something to like here.  I have this series, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guinea-Pig/dp/B000679MJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guinea Pig</a>&nbsp;flicks, and a few other collections in the genre.  I thought the ""All Night Long"" films were not as good as the early ""Guinea Pig"" films, but better than the later ones.  The effects are decent.  The acting is decent.  There is nothing particularly shocking or gut-wrenching. But they can be fun.",1325721600,,2419,6.0855457227138645
8002335,5,B0000JLLAO,"I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.

In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series.",1160352000,5,546,4.76595744680851
8002336,5,B0000JLLAO,"Japanese people are just plain scary. I'm not being prejudiced, because I love the Japanese but they have created some of the most gut wrenching and mortifying movies ever made. Audition and the Guinea Pig series come to mind. But this puts those to shame (except maybe Devil's Experiment, and Flowers of Flesh and Blood) as one of the most unsettling films ever made.

All Night Long:

The story in this one is three guys are one day standing at a railroad crossing waiting for the bars to raise up, when a crazed man comes up to a girl. The man kills the girl right in front of the three guys. And then was about to murder one of them when another rams the guy with his motorcycle. The three decide to celebrate by having a ""party"" in which they are all to bring a girl over for some fun. One of the guys actually falls in love with the girl he was going to bring to the party, but is murdered by a group of young men that bully and harass people. The guy goes insane and gets the others to come with him to kill the group. When one tries to back out. He is threatened that when they are done with the group they'll come and kill him.

The movie is quite unsettling and quite graphic in its portrayl of rape and murder. It especially show rather effectively one of the character's descent into insanity.

All Night Long 2: Atrocity:

The best of the three on this collection in my opinion. The story focuses on a nerdy student named Shinichi during his summer vacation. Shinichi is a shy and quiet individual who's only solice in life comes from painting a model of a nude manga girl. One day A rich kid and his gang of thugs start picking on Shinichi. They beat him up and torch his model. Then one day Shinichi is visited by the leader of the thugs. Claiming that he wouldn't be harmed, Shinichi takes the invitation to go to the leaders home. There the leader shows Shinichi a girl that one of the thugs have kidnapped, and raped. the leader shows Shinichi how he is capable of being abusive, and cruel to people that are ""trash."" This movie is more F***ed up than the first ANL movie. Maybe it is because it looks like it was filmed with a personal camcorder, and was made on a relatively low budget. This movie was actually more upsetting than the most vile of the Guinea Pig movies. This one is definitely not for the weak of heart or stomach.

All Night Long 3: Final Atrocity:

First off I would like to say that the title is misleading, there are two more All Night Long movies that were made after this one. This one was actually sort of a letdown, especially after the great horror that was Atrocity. Although this one is a bit more offensive. It focuses on Kiku, a mentally handicapped guy who works in a love hotel. He is a normal person until one night he comes across some of a female neighbor's garbage. He takes it home and nails some of it to his walls. I'm talking everything even used tampons. He then starts becoming obsessed with this girl. Always stealing her garbage, leering at her at her work. He even gets pissed when a guy takes her to the love hotel he works at. He also meets up with an old man who has been doing the same thing Kiku has been doing, stealing people's garbage, but he's been doing it for years. Kitamura (the director) really shows off the message of the movie series, that message being, humans are garbage, in this movie.

In short this is one of the most f***ed up series of movies to ever have been released. If you are the type that is easily upset by this style of movie you should avoid it like the plague. It is deeply disturbing and makes you say WTF more than once after you have watched them. If your into Guinea Pig, Audition, or Ebola Syndrome you would like this collection. Just be prepared for a sickening experience. Also if you're thinking about buying these movies, buy the boxset. It only costs thirty dollars, for all three of them. That is more cost effective than buying all of three of them seperately for around ninety dollars.",1121212800,15,4000,4.3453815261044175
8002337,2,B0000JLLAO,"Recently I developed a fascination for Japanese horror movies. Some of the Japanese movies are really frightening to watch, and leave a deep impact on your after watching it. Some of these movies include the Ringu(the Ring) series, Ju-on(made as `the Grudge' in English starring Sarah Michelle Gellar), and also The Eye series. After watching all of the movies mentioned previously, I thought I would give All Night Long (called `Ooru naito rongu' in Japanese) a try. Sadly, I was not pleased with this one.

The first of the trilogy revolves around 3 guys, who by coincidence, witness the murder of a woman by a psychotic man who randomly kills her on the street. Strangely enough, these 3 guys get together and become friends and decide to throw a party in order to forget the incident they were witnessed to. They decide to get dates for the party, but in the end, due to various incidents because of other people, fail in doing so. Due to these incidents, they decide to let their anger off and take revenge on these people.

The second story, called `Atrocity', starts off with a high school boy who is spends his summer vacation by chatting on the computer, and playing with a doll. He is bullied by a gang headed by a homosexual, who develops an interest for the boy. As the boy does not feel the same way about the leader, this leads to some disturbing consequences.

The third movie, named `Final Atrocity', is considerably the most graphic of all three. This time, the story consists of a young boy who works in a sleazy hotel, where customers bring in their partners to have sex with, and leave garbage lying around. The boy apparently likes collecting trash, and starts collecting those of a woman living near the hotel, who he is attracted to. He starts following her around and collecting everything that she throws, to the point where he even starts eating rubbish that she leaves behind.

Katsuya Matsumura, the director behind all three Nihilistic movies, tries to portray the disturbing image of human nature in all three of the movies, and succeeds to some extent. While the first movie was an average (I thought it would be really good considering they made so many sequels to it), the second and, especially the third, focus on too much graphic violence and abuse, which just stalls the storyline of the movie, not even progressing anywhere. The only high point of all these movies is the acting, which is considerably good, since you feel that the characters are at some point really insane. The eerie music also adds well to the background during some scenes. This is why I gave this a 2 star rating. The only reason I saw the whole series was because I was hoping that the next sequel would be better than its predecessor. After watching all the movies, you don't feel scared; instead you are left with a feeling of disgust and revulsion towards them. In the end, you wonder, what the point of the whole story was in the first place.

So, if you want to watch some really good Japanese horror, consider the ones I mentioned in the beginning of the review. However, if you like a lot of gore without any storyline, give `All Night Long' a try.",1094860800,5,3166,4.636363636363637
8002338,5,B0000JLLAO,"All 3 movies are sick and twisted.  Definatly awesome.  The second one though is my favorite.  So if you are in to disgusting meaningless murder, these movies are for you.  If not...well walk away.",1093737600,2,197,4.705882352941177
