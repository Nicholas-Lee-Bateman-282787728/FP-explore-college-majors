4048448,5,B00319ECG0,"Make the popcorn and get ready for a super festival of chick-flicks for girls of almost any age. The stories are cute, there's lots of music, dancing, romance and comedy. For the price, I can't imagine finding a better collection of some super-fun movies. This is one of my favorite movie purchases lately!",1383609600,,306,4.7924528301886795
4048449,4,B00319ECG0,"This set surprised me. I got it mostly for my kids for ""Josie..."" but after watching all of them, ""The Perfect Man"" turned out to be their favorite. I'd seen ""Blue Crush"" ears ago and liked the surfing scenes but had forgotten how bad the rap music was in it  (Rap in a Surf flick, Duh?) ""Honey"" had some fabulous dance scenes in it but the music and constant F- and S-words ruined it. That particular film is not for preteens I don't think (hence the 4 stars). ""Head Over Heels"" was pretty funny but mostly for 13 yrs and up. Worth the $ though.",1366761600,2,546,4.2
