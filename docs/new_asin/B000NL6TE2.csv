8179168,2,B000NL6TE2,"I bought this to show my German students, because my current Oktoberfest video is a little out of date.  I was surprised to see ""Mature content"" on the back of the DVD, because that's no where on the product listing.

I previewed the DVD and while the content was informative and interesting and the pictures of the people were great, the narrator mentioned beer so many times that it was ridiculous.  I get that it's about a beer festival, but the narrator sounded like his sole purpose was to get as drunk as possible.  A few times the narrator cussed.

In short, this video isn't something I'd show my students and I'm not sure why else someone would buy this, if not for German students.",1301443200,,691,4.496
