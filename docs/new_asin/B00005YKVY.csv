If I had one gripe it would be the song selections.  While most of the songs are good, and maybe harder rock, they are not what I would actually call heavy metal.  Still it is a solid DVD and I think you will get your moneys worth.",1491782400,,397,3.9873417721518987

I have bought a few different books and DVDs with songs by Black Sabbath, and i compared how 'Paranoid' was taught in each of them.  Comparing this one to the Best of Black Sabbath DVD by Troy Stetina, the way 'Paranoid' is played is completely different.  Stetina's sounded better to me, but I thought I'd try watching DVDs of Tony Iommi playing the song in concert to see who plays it the way Tony plays it.  Iommi plays it the same way as Stetina, although friends of mine play it from the E on the A string as this video suggests.  I haven't compared the version of 'Crazy Train' on this DVD to the one in Stetina's Ozzy book, but there is a good chance that Stetina's is more correct.  It's a shame as this series is clearer in its presentation, it's just slapdash though.  The worst part of the way 'Paranoid' is taught here is that he says to start the intro part in D and slide into E, whereas it should be a 12-14 hammer on for the 5th of the E5.  There are other mistakes in there in 'Paranoid' too.

If you want something easy to learn and well presented and don't really care if it is accurate to the original, this DVD is a good buy.  If you want to play it precisely though you will feel that starting here is a waste of time.",1200096000,2,1324,4.1568627450980395
