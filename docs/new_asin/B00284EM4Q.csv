8355710,3,B00284EM4Q,"After the fierce battle with Suigintou, the sister Rozen Maiden dolls continue with their lives which is causing daily mischief for Jun, as well as each other, and watching their favorite shows. However, Shinku is forced to deal with the loss of a sister. During her grief, she is immediately forced into battle with an unknown Rozen Maiden revealing herself as Bara-Suishou: The Seventh Rozen Maiden Doll. She's determined to continue the ""The Alice Game"" by killing all of her sisters to become ""Alice"" and please their ""father"".-summary

Nope, nope, nope, didn't fool me one bit. I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn't a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.

Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it's not on the same level, and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.

My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn't let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren't very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.

The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don't get me wrong here; when it's time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn't mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I'll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.

The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn't care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character's appearances and personalities.

Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out. Rozen Maiden: Traumend contains 12 episodes with a 300 minute run time.

Pros: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still pretty

Cons: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems",1427587200,,4421,4.608640406607369

8355712,5,B00284EM4Q,I own around 25 complete anime series- I have to say this is one of my favorites of all time. I won't go into the plot but I just wanted to state that individuals should give this anime a chance. This anime is geared towards everyone except little children who may may find it unsettling that the dolls fight each other. This anime is a drama but there are many parts that will have you laughing out loud. I honestly enjoyed this anime- my only issue is that I wish the ending was better and more complete.,1261440000,,506,4.22680412371134
8355713,5,B00284EM4Q,I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable. The first and now second season of this anime left me wanting a third season. The story is clearly not over.,1253577600,,299,4.357142857142857
8355714,5,B00284EM4Q,"Rozen Maiden: Trumend is the second season of Rozen Maiden.

In a nutshell, a powerful mage named Rozen from the 18th century (revealed in the manga as Count St Germain) constructed seven dolls and imbued them with a living soul known as the Rosa Mystica. Their mission is to battle each other in what is known as the Alice Game, the winner obtaining the loser's Rosa Mystica until the last one standing becomes Alice, a real girl of unmatched beauty and purity. To help them, it is expected they will acquire human partners they can use as a power source for the unique weapons and tactics each one possesses, but it appears this is optional as some of the dolls appear to not have human partners.

The first six of seven dolls in their order of creation are:

1. Suigintou
2. Kanaria
3. Suiseiseki
4. Souseiseki
5. Shinku
6. Hinaichigo

In Rozen Maiden: Trumend, it appears the seventh doll calls herself Barasuishou, but truth is far different than first appearance.

Rozen Maiden: Trumend is really not for the kiddies. Though it is very light and humorous, by Episode 7 the atmosphere takes a solid turn to the dark and the body count starts to rise when three of these gothic lolita dolls are driven to kill the others within the Alice game while the other three desperately try to protect themselves and each other.

One of the death scenes is so moving and so poignant, I have had male hard core anime fans confess that an anime moved them to tears.

My only complaints about Rozen Maiden: Trumend are the same I have with most anime.

1. Because the funding is iffy, the writers write their plots on the fly keeping the main points and creating many little inconsistencies in the minor details. The more minor details they mess up, the more the story loses credibility even though it may remain true to the main storyline. The more you mess up, the more retcom you have to do in future stories to correct the inconsistencies.

2. Japanese anime does not hesitate to use Christian symbols and churches as locales, but their understanding of the worldview is incredibly naive. In Rozen Maiden: Trumend, Christianity is used more as a gothic symbol of death.

3. A caricature of English romance literature is having the two people stare at each others eyes and repeat their names. That happens a lot of times in anime and a lot in Rozen Maiden: Trumend. If you cut out every scene where Jun and Shinku repeat each others names back and forth to convey emotion (despair, affection, apology, etc.), the entire anime would have been about two episodes shorter.

4. If you are going to have major characters die, their death has got to mean something and can't be wiped away by mere platitudes that are given as shallow and unconvincing explanations. Yes, it's anime, but if you are going to address the big topics (fate, death, responsibility, purpose), you had better come up with some substantial answers other than a shallow paradigm that's 3,000 miles wide and only 3 inches deep.

All in all, I would still recommend Rozen Maiden: Trumend to anyone who is interested. Just be aware that though I found the anime to be outstanding, it isn't perfect.",1252022400,5,3156,4.666666666666667
8355715,5,B00284EM4Q,"Finally, the long awaited complete set of ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" is here!

A 12-episode animated television series created by PEACH-PIT who are known for anime and manga such as ""DearS"", ""Di Gi Charat"", ""Shugo Chara!"" and ""Zombie-Loan"".

The second season takes place not long after the events of the first.  The dolls are now trying to enjoy their happy lives but unfortunately, Shinku starts to have nightmares and it appears the remaining sisters/dolls will be coming and that can only mean the beginning of the ""Alice Games"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend - Complete Set"" is an anime series that sports a lot of colors.  For the most part, this is a TV animated series and of course, television series in Japan are created in a short deadline and not as much detail.  But for the most part, the majority of the series takes place inside Jun's home or total darkness, so background art is not as prominent but you do get scenes with lush, beautiful painted scenery and backgrounds.  If anything, more attention was put on the characters and the dolls in battle.

It's also important to emphasize that this is a television series and not an OAV or film.  So, production quality is going to much lower.  But overall, I enjoyed the character designs for the animated series and the story of ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" made things much more enjoyable for me.

As for audio, the English dub is presented in English Dolby Digital and the Japanese language in Stereo.  The series is at the most part, all dialogue with some scenes sporting battles (this is more towards the later half of the series) between the Rozen Maiden dolls.  I listened to both audio soundtracks and both are well-done.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend - Complete Set"" comes with the following special features:

DISC 1:

  * Textless OP theme and Geneon Trailers

DISC 2:

  * Textless Ending theme and Geneon Trailers

DISC 3:

JUDGMENT CALL:

The final complete set for ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" (the second season) has arrived in the US and I'm quite thrilled that FUNimation has released the series as a complete set.

After the first two volumes were released in America through Geneon in 2007, due to Geneon's corporate situation, ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" was among many titles that were canceled.

Fortunately, in 2008, Geneon and FUNimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America and while Geneon has the license, FUNimation Entertainment will have the exclusive rights for the sales and distribution for the titles which include ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"".

The concept of living dolls may seem a bit freaky for some people but in Japan, there is a large collector-based for ""Volks"" dolls.  As there are many guys who collect action figures and mecha machines in Japan (and also in the US), the Volks dolls are quite an accomplishment for collectors who need to build them and in the end result, these dolls are well-crafted and quite beautiful.

Of course, in America, the thought of dolls coming alive are seen in horror films (""Chucky"" anyone?) and I for one, have always thought of dolls coming alive to be horrifying (yes, as a youngster, I threw out my sister's dolls because I thought they were possessed).  But overall, the concept of ""Rozen Maiden"" has never scared me or freaked me out and I have to admit, ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" was a much darker series than its predecessor and I have to admit that I enjoyed the overall storyline and this concept of how the dolls must fight to the death for the purpose of being ""Alice"".

It's hard to deny the cuteness of the series and their own character traits.  Where this series could have been cliche and annoying, overall their own personal quirks is what makes the series so fun. I really had fun watching this series.

With ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"", you get a good balance of lighthearted humor and action.  Whereas the first series focused on Jun and how the dolls have helped him overcome his ""hikkimori"", this series features on character development of the dolls and how quickly they are put into a position that they don't want to be.  They just want to be happy but because their creator has put together this ""Alice Game"", they can't bow out and resist.  They must fight.

In the end, I found ""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" to be an enjoyable, cute and humorous anime series.  The lighthearted fun carries on for a little over half of the second series but it quickly becomes serious and more intense.  But for the most part, the whole series held my attention with each episode and I fount that very cool!

But now after watching this second season, I want more!  One can only hope that we get the two episode OAV ""Rozen Maiden: Ouvert&uuml;re"" released soon in the US (this OAV supposedly gives us a look back of why Suigintou and Shinku do not get along) and hopefully we see a new series to continue the adventures of the Rozen Maiden dolls.

""Rozen Maiden: Tr&auml;umend"" is definitely a series worth recommending!",1248134400,14,6775,4.861646234676007
