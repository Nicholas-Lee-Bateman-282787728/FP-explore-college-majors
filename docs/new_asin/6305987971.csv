8200112,4,6305987971,"PLOT: British upper class men become commy spies.

in the 1930s the Communist ""handler"" recruits 3 men to give secrets to Russia. The second world War was not yet started and the real enemies they felt were the Nazis and the ""Communists"" promised a classless society and peace.  The British Upper class are above suspicion in this movie and soon the 3 men advance into high careers in MI5 and MI6 and the Foreign Office. They give atomic secrets away. When an old 1945 intercept is ""transcribed"" with new computer type devices they learn that a spy named Homer lived in Washington and was in the British Serviced. MI5 ""narrows"" the possibilities down to MacClean. MacClean is cracking mentally under the strain of his secret activities and is soon to ""BE"" arrested. Philby along with the ""Russian Handler"" arranges from MaClean and Burgess to ""disappear"" to the Soviet Union. Soon Philby is being grilled and is later moved to a DEAD end job in Beuruit due to his affiliation with Burgess and MaClean.....Philby 8 years later 'admits' he is a Communist and also ends up moving to Russia. Derek Jacobi(Burgess) is the best here as the alcoholic and gay man who has no scruples what so ever. Anthony Bates (Philby) is the moody but rock solid Philby who every one trusts. The Brits are their own worst enemy in this one when they fail to find this group of spies for over 10 to 30 years in some cases. TV movie done in 3 ....25 minutes parts ...(around 90 minutes total)...better than expected. also see the Cambridge Spies.....4 STARS~~~~ (Burgess died in 1963 of alcoholism and MacClean died 1983 and Philby died in 1989 with full Communist Military POMP due to his ""sacrifices"" for Russia. Oddly enough the Russians did not trust them once they moved to Russia and they were given meaningless jobs with very little to do....",1400371200,,1825,4.717868338557993

8200114,2,6305987971,"This is a review of the production and the quality of the DVD. Firstly, the screenplay comes off with an almost sympathetic view of the main characters, one even lamenting that there was no turning back, as if he had just made a simple error when young and now he had to continue through with it. The acting was okay and the homosexuality of some of the characters was acknowledged. I can't say how accurrate the storyline was, but it did seem a rather truncated version for what apparently went on.

The quality of the DVD was very bad. It was very cheaply transfered and it shows. The image was rather muddy and looked poorly as a whole, but when areas of the frame became dark the picture would go haywire and turn green and pixelated. Needless to say that this poor image quality definately takes away from viewing pleasure.",1348099200,,828,4.52
8200115,3,6305987971,"While the scrpt and performances in Philby, Burgess and Maclean are excellent, the quality of the DVD recording itself leaves much to be desired.  Still, if you are interested in (a) spies, (b) the cold war, (c) nuclear secrets or (d) all of the above, this is a good movie to add to your collection.",1205193600,6,300,4.454545454545454
8200116,2,6305987971,"This 1977 biopic, which was advised by Phillip Knightley, cannot be faulted for distortion of the known facts of the case, although they are so compressed that they seem to have been forced into a telescope backwards. It can, however, be faulted for its egregiously shoddy production values. The entire enterprise, in fact, reminds me of one of those dreadful after-school specials that they used to have on TV, in which the producers were flogging some topical issue such as the dangers of teen promiscuity or substance abuse (in this case, the dangers of Soviet espionage). As with the teen specials, the leading actors (Anthony Bate as Philby, and Derek Jacobi as Burgess) are excellent, but the story itself is merely a recitation of events, with no pace, no buildup of suspense. Furthermore, the quality of the DVD itself [which seems to have been pirated off a VHS tape] with its flickering lighting, and over-saturated dark colors that disintegrate into rainbow blobs, is ghastly. Even the introduction theme, with its long shadows on red cobblestones, lamp post, rolling soccer ball and bulldog (One supposes that they are meant to represent England under the communist threat.), looks both dated and amateurish. One finds better visuals on computer games. And the music with its wheezy out-of-tune canned saxophones--or whatever they are--is quite opprobrious. This DVD is recommended only for those who are addicted to the topic of the Cambridge Spies.

And even we have our limits!",1201996800,26,1492,5.114754098360656
8200117,5,6305987971,"This is a real gem, and a superior production to either the glibly superficial 'Cambridge Spies' or the slightly silly 'Another Country', two historical dramas that centre roughly around the same events. The acting is superb, the Ian Curteis script taut, the build-up and motivation believable. Antony Bate bares an almost uncanny resemblance to the real Philby, Derek Jacobi is suitable disheveled as Guy Burgess, and the best scene belongs to Micheal Culver as McLean losing it in the men's room of the Egyptian embassy.  As a piece of TV drama it has rarely been equaled, although it is slightly dated, and remains a benchmark of how this sort of make historical drama should be made (in my humble opinion). I'm really glad this has been released to DVD. Hopefully, 'An Englishman Abroad', Alan Bennet's brilliant screenplay with Alan Bates as Guy Burgess will at last make it to DVD format as well.",1200441600,13,902,4.895424836601308
8200118,3,6305987971,"""Philby, Burgess, and MacLean"" dates from 1977. On the good side, we are treated to wonderful early performances by superb actors such as (Sir) Anthony Bate and (Sir) Derek Jacobi, who would go on to star in ""I, Claudius"". Their technique is mesmerizing. On the negative side, this film tends to gloss over the truly sordid side of MacLean and Burgess (their love affair and Burgess's near-incoherence from drinking.) Worst of all, of course, is that in 1977, it was not yet known that royal art historian Sir Anthony Blunt (""Master of the Queen's Pictures"") had been the mastermind behind the entire espionage group, and he was caught but never prosecuted. A far better historical treatment would be the more recent ""The Cambridge Spies"" (available on Amazon, and starring the equally superb Samuel West as Blunt.) Do yourself a favor; get both. You'll want them.",1199923200,17,864,4.9655172413793105
8200119,2,6305987971,"Although Bates is quite good as Philby, and the scenes in which he parries questions from his low-key but penetrating inquisitor are well done, overall this film is disappointing. Only for those who must read or see everything about the Cambridge spy ring.",1189382400,5,256,4.976744186046512
