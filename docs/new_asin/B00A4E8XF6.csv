8546686,5,B00A4E8XF6,"Skip to paragraph 3 for the actual review of Gumball.  Also, this IS a region 2 DVD.  Don't buy it unless you have a region 2 DVD player.

Before I give an actual review, I feel obliged to say that yes, this DVD is in fact a region 2 DVD... And it says so in the product description.  It actually has a warning on the page that says that it won't play in most U.S. DVD players.  I mean, who in their right mind, after having read both reviews from people that couldn't get it to work, would buy a region 2 DVD for the sole purpose of trying to get it to work in a region 1 DVD player?  You'd have to be a moron.

A moron like me.  Yep, my main motivation for getting this DVD was just to see if I could get it to work.  With that said, it's actually not hard to get it to work in a computer's DVD drive, or at least it wasn't for me.  The DVD drive will probably be region locked and won't want to play the DVD unless you change the drive's region.  DO NOT DO THIS!  You can only change its region about 5 times before it's locked for good.  Instead, get VLC media player, hook your computer up to your big fancy TV, and play it from there.  What I did to get it to work was open up VLC, go to media > open disc... and a menu should pop up.  select the ""Disc"" tab and under ""Disc device"" put D:/VIDEO_TS and click ""play.""  Wait a minute or so and it should play.  Note that you'll have to change the D:/ if the DVD drive isn't the D:/ drive.  If it still doesn't play, then it's probably the drive hardware itself preventing it from playing.  There are solutions to this, but they're much more involved and you're probably better off just trying to get it to work on another computer you may or may not have lying around somewhere.

WITH ALL OF THAT SAID, I feel it's unfair to base a review of a DVD on its region code, so my rating is based solely on the quality of the show and the DVD it's on.  The Amazing World of Gumball is a fantastic show.  It's about a blue cat named Gumball who always manages to get himself into absurd and hilarious situations.  It's a show that people of any age can laugh at and relate to.  It has some hilarious moments of slapstick, often followed by some absolutely adorable character moments.

In short, Gumball is one of the best cartoons I've seen in a long time.  If you haven't seen it before, you should definitely check it out.  Just... remember to buy it for the right region please.",1456963200,6,2426,4.07399577167019
