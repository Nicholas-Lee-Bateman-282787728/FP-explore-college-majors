2963467,3,B000W90NVK,"Brilliant, under-appreciated Dr. Houseman, played by Gene LeBrock, is trying to figure out how to slow down or stop the aging process.  When unbelieving or jealous colleagues threaten Dr. Houseman's funding, he decides to speed things up with a human trial - on himself.

This low-budget film is reasonably good for most of the movie.  It is dark and introspective with similarities to ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""  Dr. Houseman goes through a number of changes during the movie punctuated by extreme and bloody violence.  Things get really scary when Dr. Houseman threatens his girlfriend and her son, which leads up to the exciting and tense ending that falls apart at the last minute when you want to laugh.

***Plot Spoiler***

In order to understand my disappointment at the end of the movie, I have to reveal more about the ending than I prefer doing.  However, you have a chance to back away from reading further.  I will endeavor to minimize what I say.

This movie is well done up until the final scene where the metamorphosis of Dr. Houseman is complete.  Obviously, he was turning into something, which I will not reveal.  The problem is that the special effects used to show Dr. Houseman after the change were, to put it gently and kindly, horrible.  I am not sure whether I was laughing, groaning, or what at that final scene.  I just remembered that this movie began with a lot of promise, and then fell flat all in one scene.

So, you have this one in a nutshell.  This movie is decent with a lot of tension right up to the final scene.  Had the movie finished off just a little differently, it could easily have been a four star movie.

Picture and Sound:  The picture was okay.  While the picture could be cleaner, it was generally clear.  The sound quality was also okay.

Good luck!",1302220800,7,1799,4.608832807570978

8221748,3,B000W90NVK,"Mad science runs amok in METAMORPHOSIS (1990)! Young, brash Dr. Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is a University professor, and a genius in the field of genetics. He's been performing experiments that have been questioned, due to their high price tag. Enter Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov) who has arrived to see where all the donors' money is going. Houseman has been working on a serum that would reverse the aging process. The results of his experiments have been... mixed. When his funding is cut off, Houseman takes the drastic step of using his untried formula on himself! The results of his impetuous decision are... disturbing! Houseman's transformation begins almost immediately, w/ his sense of hearing amplified to an incredible level. He visits Susan to tell her of his success, and soon, their clothes disappear! The next day, Peter seems to recall something terrible that happened the previous night. Something caused by his serum. Is he losing his mind, or is he turning into some sort of monster? It's not long before Peter starts changing physically as well. With the help of his assistant, Houseman goes back to the lab, in order to fix the problem. Unsurprisingly, his situation only gets worse. What will be his final state? Will his love for Sally prevail? Will she still love Peter as a murdering mutant? Stay put for the utterly absurd finale!...",1516060800,,1369,5.008771929824562

8221755,1,B000W90NVK,"This here is a review of the Metamorphosis dvd as pictured.  Plain black case, printed off of someone's cheap printer [feels like construction paper, you know, the kind kids use for crafts] and is a dvdr.  That's right, a DVD-R. A CHEAP dvd-r. The dvd-r itself comes with a [construction]paper label sloppily glued to the disc, in a way that it would surely detach itself in your player.  No menus at all, either, and 2 chapter stops. Whoo hoo.

Now, I have this film on VHS.  I like it enough to upgrade to dvd. HOWEVER, the picture quality of the vhs is a million times better than this piece.  Worst of all, whoever transfered this to dvd decided that they needed to make it a widescreen presentation.  In doing so, the top and bottom of the picture are smashed in, so that everyone in the movie is a pancake face.  Thanks a lot, ""Reel Classic Films"", that's exactly how I want to watch Metamorphosis.  Squashed.  Seriously, I could make myself a better dvd than this with my vhs tape.  This is getting returned.  Hard.",1304380800,9,1022,4.494565217391305
