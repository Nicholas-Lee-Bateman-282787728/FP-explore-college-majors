3895960,4,B002BWD75U,"This anime can be slow and confusing at times but overall it becomes good. As i watched it there were times in which i was losing interest in it but it always managed to hook me again. That reason for these moments of boredom is because of how the show is structured. It is done in separate arcs or mini stories in which we see the same events unfold in different ways. In each arc the story is restarted and goes from the characters having fun and develops from there until it ends in tragedy. After watching each arc i found myself more confused and intrigued. The first arcs are known as question arcs and there are later arcs that are called answer arcs although they don't always answer questions but instead offer similar circumstances to a previous question arc but with some differences and a different resolution. I think that in this set only the last two are considered answer arcs. i would have to check to be sure. After watching this series you might feel confused and disappointed because you never find out what exactly is occuring even at the end. This is because there is a second season of the series called Higurashi no Naku Koro ni kai which continues the story with more answer arcs. As of right know i don't think it has been released in the US but hopefully it will be because it completes the series and explains the reason why everything happened. So in conclusion when they cry is a good anime that I found to be interesting most of the time. Some people might not like the art style or how the story arcs are structured so it isn't an anime for everyone. But for me its only flaw was that it didn't have the complete story. But that's resolved by watching the second season. So if you don't mind an anime with little or no action that is slow to progress and provide answers and will leave you with more questions and confusion than answers at the end of it you'll probably enjoy this anime and will eagerly await the second part.
I apologize if this review is poorly structured and kind of random. It is the 1st i've ever written and i hope it isn't too confusing and that it is helpful to those thinking about buying when they cry.",1267401600,,2161,4.3915211970074814
3895961,5,B002BWD75U,"""When They Cry"" (""Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni"" or ""When the Cicadas Cry,"" a colorful term meaning the summertime in Japan when the cicada's cry can be almost deafening) is one of the most unique adaptations I have seen of the Japanese computer game-type known as a visual novel.

Visual novels (although in the case of ""Higurashi no Naku Koro"" it was called a ""sound novel"" due to its use of mood-setting music and sound effects) are kind of like ""Choose your own adventure"" books for the computer. Players get a standard plotline that can be resolved in different ways based on conversations they have with other characters and choices they make in the game. In the case of ""When They Cry,"" the game was a murder-mystery where the killer and victims could be any number of people depending on how the game was played. The anime for ""When They Cry"" replicated this by making a series of story arcs, each which resolves the main story in a different style.

The basic set-up is always the same. Five friends live in the small village of Hinamizawa home of the summer festival known as Watanagashi where bits of cotton are floated down the stream to do away with bad memories. Keiichi is a young boy who has recently moved to the village, where he quickly befriends a group of four girls, Rena, Mion, Satoko, and Rika. Things start out innocently enough, but slowly Keiichi learns of a local legend of a village curse by someone named Oyashiro, and that every year on the Watanagashi festival someone is murdered and someone disappears forever.

The twenty-six episode box set has six story arcs, ""Spirited Away by Demons, ""Cotton Drifting,"" ""Curse Killing,"" ""Time Killing,"" ""Eye Opening (Actually ""Cotton Drifting"" told from a different point of view) and ""Attonment."" Each story arc starts on a sunny day on the way to school, and ends with bloody murder. The plots can vary quite wildly, with only a few elements linking together each of the story arcs.

When you first watch ""When They Cry,"" this can be somewhat disconcerting. At the end of one episode all of the main characters are thrown down wells or chopped up into pieces, only to have them whole and healthy at the beginning of the next story arc with no mention of what you have just watched. Once you get into the rhythm of the series, this cycle becomes comfortable and it is fun wondering who will be the killer and who will be killed this time around. There is even a little meta-joke in the series, as the friends are members of a club who play a game like Clue, trying to guess who the killer, location and weapon will be in the game.

There is a sharp contrast between the cutesy character designs and the foul play that eventually ends the story arcs. With the first episode, I was almost annoyed at the characters because they seemed like every fluffy bunny stereotype of anime girls you could possibly imagine. This only made it more fun however when the baseball bats started swinging and the blood started flowing. The series really took me by surprise when it made its dark turn.

The story arcs aren't entirely separate. Each one introduces some new elements of the characters that might be carried over into the next story arc, like Mion's twin sister, Shion who appears to complicate the situation. Even if the story doesn't flow, the character development does.

This ""Viridian Collection"" is a re-release by Funimation of the ""When They Cry"" series that was originally released by Geneon Animation but transfered the rights to Funimation.  Like others in the Viridian Collection, this is a more ""bare bones"" and affordable release of the series. In the case of this release, not much has been pared down as the Geneon release didn't have many bonus features in the first place.",1264982400,3,3754,4.703196347031963
3895962,4,B002BWD75U,"Keiichi Maebara's life has just gotten a whole lot better after his move to the small town of Hinamizawa. He's made friends with four of the local girls, Rena, the girl who LOVES anything adorable, Rika, the kind kid who always cheers her friends up, Satoko, the trickster, and Mion, the tomboyish leader of the group. They all enjoy spending time during their summer with the new transfer student from the big city, and it seems like a dream come true for Keiichi. If this sounds like the premise for a harem comedy series, you wouldn't be too wrong. When They Cry, or Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni(When the Cicadas Cry), works by setting the stage for what seems to be a gentle slice-of-life with traditional anime tropes and going on to reveal what it really is: a horror-mystery series.

Of course, the change is gradual. The first episode might have a disturbing first few minutes and a creepy opening song, but then it shifts focus to the daily lives of Keiichi and his friends. As Keiichi starts to find out, however, life in his new town might not be as idyllic as he once thought; as the upcoming Cotton Drifting Festival draws nearer, he starts to hear some disturbing rumors about Hinamizawa, some of which might even involve his new-found friends. Every year on the night of the Cotton Drifting Festival, one person is killed while another goes missing as a part of Oyashiro, the local deity's, curse. While no one officially knows what happened to the victims, the Hinamizawans are suspected to be the conspirators, as all the deaths are linked in some way to a conflict that would have meant the end for the village. As Keiichi finds out more, his friends begin acting more and more suspiciously, and what once seemed like a paradise to him has now become a nightmare.

Higurashi's strength lies in the transformation of these kids from cute, normal teenagers to ruthless killers. One changes from a sweet girl to a cleaver-wielding, maniacally laughing madwoman with a troubled past within a couple of episodes, while Keiichi himself cannot avoid becoming increasingly paranoid as he watches his life fall apart and his friends go crazy. Odd camera angles and creepy facial distortions courtesy of the animation Studio Deen also help to make the kids turn into ones possessed by demons, as the show claims.

The story is divided into six arcs (four ""question arcs"" and two ""answer arcs""): the Spirited Away by Demons Chapter, the Cotton Drifting Chapter, the Curse Killing Chapter, the Time Wasting Chapter, the Eye Opening Chapter, and the Atonement Chapter. Each presents a specific scenario that focuses on different characters, with some following the main time-line and others either set in the past or as companion arcs to earlier chapters. Each completes its storyline within four or so episodes and resets itself for the next arc, similarly to Groundhog Day. While the arcs don't seem to cross over with one another (for the most part), the information you receive in one arc gets carried on to the next.

This set-up lends itself to the mystery aspect of the show. While seeing kids go crazy multiple times might be what the show is about, it shares a focus with several core mysteries. The reasons behind the killings in each arc, Oyashiro's Curse, and one other bigger problem that reveals itself a few arcs in are all gradually revealed within the storyline. Each arc gives you some pieces to these puzzles, and while not all of them might be used in the end (After all, what is a mystery without red-herrings?), some carry over and some seemingly minor details from one arc might present a solution in another.

This brings me to this series' one major flaw: it's incomplete. It was based off of a series of eight visual novels (video games without any major gameplay features), and the first season of When They Cry only covers six of them. Given that each individual visual novel contains from eight to ten hours worth of content, it would have been impossible to compress all of that into a thirteen hour anime (and even then, the anime lost some of its focus on the central mysteries and character development, and even got rid of a key character to make up time constraints). Season 1 doesn't suffer much because of  the speedy pacing, but the lack of the final two arcs means that the answers to the series won't be found/ confirmed until Higurashi Kai (When They Cry: The Answer) is licensed and released. Fortunately, having covered two of the series' ""Answer Arcs"", Higurashi still leaves you with answers for some of the questions that had plagued the series, and careful viewing makes it possible to figure out even more of the truth behind the series.

One more aspect of the show that doesn't quite meet expectations is the English dub, which is something of a mixed bag. While the character changes from cute to creepy enable some voice actors to shine (Kelli Kassidi as Mion/ Shion and Karen Strassman as Takano for example), others don't fare as well (Grant George as Keiichi and Mela Lee as Rena), and most just wind up sounding average. Unless you can't stand reading subtitles, you might consider listening to the Japanese audio track, which is on whole superior.

While When They Cry might seem like a standard anime series with cutesy character-designs and a harem-esque premise, it eventually becomes a solid psychological thriller complete with a bucket-load of horror. Anime fans who enjoy mysteries or horror series should give this series a try and see what Hinamizawa is all about. Just be sure to watch out for Keiichi and company; those cleavers hurt.",1263859200,,5604,4.7939958592132506
3895963,4,B002BWD75U,"It was a great beginning on the first episode but after it,it just got confusing because it went back and forth with different stories on every episode through the entire season.

3895965,4,B002BWD75U,"""When They Cry"", or ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" (When the Cicadas Cry) is a unique murder-mystery anime series based on a popular Japanese video game.  And how do video game adaptations usually fare, class?  Well, consider the curse shattered.  This is the best animated horror not named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellsing/dp/B001CFQO48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellsing</a>&nbsp;that I have seen in many years and the opening credit sequence is wonderful and reportedly features backmasking in the industrial-tinged theme song.  Creepy!

 The first 5 episodes of this anime are beyond fabulous and the story is told in amazingly bold form. It closely resembles both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man/dp/B000JVT1U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>&nbsp;in tone and themes, but Higurashi adds that brand of cloying cuteness that can only be found in anime which only manages to accentuate the disturbing content.  There have been two seasons total that have aired in Japan with a third just beginning and an OVA (original video animation) planned as well.  Here in America, we've only had the first season so far.  This is the season I'll be reviewing.

Keichi is a transfer student making friends at his new school in the village of Hinamizawa. he's already found his way into a club of energetic girls who play games and enact embarrassing punishments on the loser. It's adorable. But the village has secrets. Lots of 'em. And nearly as many endearing characters to go with those buried secrets. Each year they hold a celebration known as The Drifting Cotton Festival . Each year somebody dies on that night and another disappears altogether. Nobody talks about it. It is simply dismissed as the curse of the village's guardian deity, Oyashiro, and those who vanish are referred to as having been ""spirited away by the demon"". The more Keichi learns, the more frightening the first story arc in the anime becomes. Who are his new friends and why have they been connected to every single victim? ""When They Cry"" is a tale (several, actually) of paranoia, secrets & lies (gotta have those), mystery, and suspense so thick that a cherubic anime girl could cut with a very large cleaver. And that's just in the first part of a story that will be retold in many different ways.

What sets this apart from any other murder-mystery I've seen is that we see the ending (one of many more to come) at the finish of the first four episodes. After that, time is rewound and we are taken back to the beginning to see a different sequence of events play out and fall in love with the characters all over again in spite of knowing (part of) the horrible truth. The cast bugged me for the first 10 minutes or so with their cutesy character designs and cliche anime mannerisms, but by the end of the first episode, I was hooked on Higurashi. And it wasn't just the people clawing their own throats open. It's the fright of seeing a typically darling girl for this medium turn into a menacing entity for just a second before switching back to her saccharine self as though nothing at all had happened. Or the way their pupils narrow cat-like into slits as they innocently (or maybe not) point out similarities between Keichi and the last student to ""transfer"" away from the school without a trace. The first climax in episode four will drop your jaw, guaranteed. But by the end of the very next twenty minutes, all will be forgiven and you will again be wrapped up in the sweetness of the same characters whose lives you just saw end horrifically.  Just another day.  And another.  And another.  It's like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day/dp/B00005U8EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day</a>&nbsp;with more darling anime girl murderers.

The cast is outstanding and expansive, and each retold story tends to focus on a different character or aspect of the village.  Some arcs are prequels or sequels to other arcs or link up with them in ways that change your perception of a given event.  For example, there are a pair of identical twins within a yakuza family who are fond of switching roles with each other, so you never really know which one you are seeing.  Confusing, but intriguing.  Other arcs are entirely apart from the rest and seem to be based on alternate dimension scenarios.  This theory is given credence in the season's last episodes.  The inner workings and history of Hinamizawa are chilling and each story adds to this.  Then there is the violence.  Sweet, sweet violence.  Adorable characters being tortured mercilessly or found with their entrails hanging out while birds feast upon them and the occasional baseball bat murder are the norm here.  The show always has something disturbing waiting for you around the next corner.  And after that: more disturbing.

The relationships between the characters are important and spiderwebish in their intricacy.  It seems that everybody in Hinamazawa is connected to each other.  It is a small isolated town, after all.  This makes for a great setting that allows the characters to breathe.  It also keeps you guessing about what combination of characters will die in any given story and how.  Will it be the nosy photographer and his beautiful companion from out-of-town?  Okay, so they never live.  One can always hope.  Maybe little Satoko-chan will get gutted this time out while she pines for her ""Nii-Nii"", the brother who mysteriously ""transferred"" out after their parents were killed at the festival and he murdered their cruel uncle.  But no, not the sweetheart priestess Rika?!?!  Oh, sucks to go out like that!  Man, this series is fun and sadistic.

""When They Cry"" is a psychotic good time filled with mystery, murder, and cuteness. Lots of cuteness. On occasion it goes over-the-top and becomes unintentionally comedic and seeing the story play out with the same setting and characters over and over may wear on some viewers over time.  The final arc is the weakest and fizzles out at the end just when it seems ready to serve up the biggest buffet of horror yet, which is disappointing to say the least.  But at the end of season one, I am definitely up for more, though I do wish the rest of the season had been as strong as that first series of episodes.  Having read reviews of future seasons, I've been greeted with the notion that Higurashi does indeed get old, but as of now it's a fantastic and intricate horror anime that murder-mystery fans need to check out.

3895966,5,B002BWD75U,"Some people may be drawn to the series because of the way the characters are drawn; I would recommend that these people do a little research about the series before purchasing it.  This series has a fairly dark storyline and some very gory scenes.  I would recommend this to those that like to think about the story as it progresses.  I think that this is a great series as it deviates from the norm quite a bit and has a well thought out plot.  I will definitely purchase the second and third seasons if they release them in the states, until then I guess I will have to watch the fan subs.",1255910400,,591,4.25
3895967,5,B002BWD75U,"The story of Higurashi (When They Cry) is extremely interesting, you start off with Keiichi moving to Hinamizawa, making friends and then the paranoia slowly begins. The Watanagashi festival begins the plot movement and it quickly whisks you away on a psychological ride that is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat. The episodes are arranged in a unique fashion that leaves the watcher asking for more, it may seem at first like there is no reasoning to it, but as the episodes go on you start to make sense of what is going on and why it was placed that way. If you watch this anime, you must be able to stomach gore, as the whole series somewhat resembles a murder mystery only more gory.

I personally loved this series, it's rare that a series keeps me on the edge of my seat and leaves me wondering what will happen next. Higurashi really did that for me and left me unable to stop watching until I got the answers I wanted. It's a great anime for the horror lovers collection or mystery lovers collection. So if you love that feeling of not knowing what is going to happen, go for this anime, you won't regret it.

It is recommended if you watch Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni (When They Cry), that you watch Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai because ""Kai"" explains and concludes what happened in ""Ni"". Though ""Kai"" hasn't been released to the United States yet. There also are a couple of OVA's that haven't been released to the United States yet, though they aren't really essential to watch.",1255305600,3,1498,4.443636363636363
3895968,5,B002BWD75U,"This anime is by far one of the most unique and orginal ones I have ever seen. The story is so deep and vast that you will probably have to watch it a 2nd time through to find out the true details. I got this while at an anime convention in Dallas, TX and I saw it at a Funimation Booth. I decided to give it a try because the synopsis sounded interesting and I am very glad I did. The story is set in 1983 in a village outside of Japan. The series revolves around a re-occuring 8 main characters that are vastly connected to one another. What will blow your mind though is how the story has been ""spliced"" if you will, into various fragments and is told through each characters point of view. The sets of episodes that focus on one exact sub-story of the main story are called ""Arcs"" and will restart to a new after so many episodes. In the beginning you will be drawn to a certain arc but will only be confused as the characters that were killed or left at the end of it, all of a sudden reappear and the story resets for the next one. What is revealed though is that they are actually taking places at different perspectives and it will all come together in the end to reveal the true story of why these things have been occuring/past occuring (Still with me? ^^).

The characters also are so well potrayed that at many moments I found myself and my friend (whom I watched it with) actually cheering at certain parts for the main hero of that arc. It is a great anime but a very violent and dark one at that. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN OR CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR THAT MATTER. Each arc will always start off slow but will build up to a bloody conclusion or shocking ending. I was amazed at just how deep they went with the violence of these children for such a setting. Some may be turned off by the story but if you are into mysteries, love horror, and enjoy character developement and deep stories than definitely check this out.",1255305600,17,1937,4.235135135135135

I won't go into details because the previous review said it all but the more you watch this story you'd want to watch the second season. two thumbs up. when they cry is also known as higurashi no naku koro ni. and the second season wait for it is known as higurashi no naku koro ni KAI.",1254960000,2,581,4.196428571428571

Over the past few years, I have begun to buy more DVD's to show my support for the companies who produce these works. Trying to be as supportive as possible, I decided to look for the DVD's to Higurashi so I could support Funimation/Geneon and the hard work they put into manufacturing the series for us. To my dismay, I finally find it on Amazon for WAY more than it needs to be. Higurashi is good, but not $200 good. Please people throw me a bone here. I want to help you, but it is hard when you charge this much for a set of DVD's. I would be interested in purchasing a copy if somebody wanted to sell me one around $90-$100. But until this item goes down in price I am afraid I will have to pass for now. My recommendation, stream it if you like Horror/Mystery plot lines. Higurashi is not one to be missed, but do not pay this much for it when you can get it for free. Like I said, I enjoyed it so much I would pay near $100 for it if anybody is interested. Until then I will just have to hope I can find it at a better price at Anime Expo this year.

I deemed it as one of the worse shows ever made and it would give me nightmares...and then my sister forced me to sir down and watch the series with her since I complained about it so much...

I feel really stupid now because I almost missed out on one of the best series ever made.

The story takes place in a town called Hinazawa. Keiichi Maebara moves in recently and meets a group of girls at the new school. Little does he know they all have a secret and its these secrets he wants to uncover especially on the day of the festival where one person goes missing and another one ends up dead each year.

This season has all the question arcs and two answer arcs of the visual novel. You wouldn't know how much was left out though given the anime does a good job of putting the most vital information in (minus the Shion arc on why she fell for Satoshi as the manga and visual novel actually has a better reason on why she loves him so much instead of him just rescuing and being nice to her).

The story overall is confusing and revolves around the groundhog day loop (everyone knows this when jumping into the anime given they see clips online) , but the question is how to put the series together. The theme of this series is all about the power of friendship and how trust is the most important thing to survive because without the trust, you'll dead as most of these arcs show.

3895987,5,B002BWD75U,"This anime is amazing. There are six different arcs that all have a different plot, each one culminating with the Watanagashi festival and focusing on the events of Oyashiro-sama's curse. You get to watch as one by one each of the characters fall victim to a trap no one can see and go crazy. There's violence, there's humor, and a bunch of really strong kids, all the requirments for good anime except the happy ending.
Each of the arcs holds a key that will help you understand what happens in the other arcs. There are little things that don't seem incredibly important until you see a later episode. This quirk makes it more than worth it to watch the series twice. In each arc a different character falls into the trap, pushed by different circumstances. this anime does a very good job of exploring just what fear does to people in a frighteningly direct way. And despite all the craziness, at the end of it all is one answer,can you believe it?",1360540800,,951,4.534883720930233
3895988,4,B002BWD75U,"Keiichi has recently moved to Hinamizawa. He becomes friends with Rena, Mion, Satoko, and Rika. This group of friends seems pretty close, but they all have some major secrets. Every year on the day of a festival, people are murdered in Hinamizawa. Keiichi learns that his friends may have something to do with the murders. He does his best to get to the bottom of the mystery, but he gets in over his head. Now there is a ""curse"" on him, and he may not make it out the mess alive.

This anime is very unique. It has really cute animation, and character designs. The mixing of those elements with hefty amounts of violence, including torture, make this series very different. The story is also gonna catch you off guard. The story ends after the 4th episode. The rest of the episodes are a retelling of the events that led up to the conclusion. Each characters perspective on things is explored, and you are faced with an enormously complicated plot with lots of deceit, murder, insanity, and jealousy.

There are parts when this series drags. There is a story arc toward the beginning that doesn't really seem to fit in or make any sense. At times I felt a little exasperated with When They Cry. It moves very slow, and gets into your head. Even though the story is heavy, it also mixes in some fun to lighten the mood. I think that not everyone will enjoy When They Cry. I have mixed feelings about it. I think that I expected a little more.

As you can tell, this series is extremely expensive. I bought it from playtech-asia.com for $30. It comes in a beautiful box with 2 DVD's that contain 13 episodes each. The series is English dubbed, and the voice cast is pretty good. I think it's worth checking out for that price. If your interested, I suggest looking into it at playtech-asia.com.

One of the reasons I kept watching the show was because of the EPIC characters! Especially Rena, who had me sold right away. She can be sweet and loves everything cute, but then, she can be really creepy and go crazy, before turning back to normal. Don't forget her axe, cause it's a perfect kind of weapon for her XD.
Along with that are the twins, Shion and Mion, Satoko, Rika, and Keiichi, who is the only boy among the main cast. After watching the first episodes, you'll most likely be confused, but if you keep watching, in the later episodes things get explained.

3896025,4,B002BWD75U,"First:  This is NOT the complete version.  It's not complete by the original Japanese version, OR the fansub version.  This set is missing five shorts, a promotional video, AND ""The Cat Killing Chapter.""  I am so tired of Geneon/Pioneer skimping out on all the extras for the non-Japanese public, even under their own releasing label.
However, it is very nice to get the six discs that were released all in one standard size Amaray case for the Viridian Collection.  The exact same discs are available in the 3 thin-pak box set, and the individual six separate Amaray case versions.

Second: It's still not complete when you consider that a very large amount of material is still not exposed or explained within the first season... It is continued, in much the same fashion, in the second ""Kai"" series -- another 24 episodes, on top of the first 27 (of which 26 are only provided to US audiences).  However, the Kai series was never released in the US.  Even if it is, it will be missing both the News Special, and the 24 shorts.  On top of that, there are 9 more episodes in OVA (direct-to-video) format, which haven't and may not be released to audiences outside of Japan.

Now that you have been informed of that, and also have several other reviews that are aimed at the actual series' plot, I have one another couple of points to go over...
I have read many reviews from people that either can't follow the multiple paths and details, or have subsumed all the details into one linear story stream, and can't distinguish them.  This series DOES NOT just loop around over and over to take perspectives from each of the characters.  In EVERY loop there are significant inconsistencies, and though they are there, details on the individual characters are fleshed out each time you go through.  Trying to figure out why all of this is going on this way is part of the attraction of this (major WTF? factor, too), and you can't get it all unless you continue with the second series, or you have played the visual novels.  ""Leakage"" from previous passes begin to show up near the end of the first season, and that's a big part. Also, unlike lots of ""reviewers"" that don't pay attention, just because things like, aliens, time-travel, bio-terrorism, intelligent diseases, parallel universes, prescience, and other major anime and movie tropes get mentioned, DOES NOT MEAN that they are any more real that the same crap is in true-reality.  Just because some nutball says that a UFO landed in Kansas (or Okinomiya for that matter) doesn't mean it did.  This should be kept clearly in mind as the series progresses.
Risking major spoilage has me limiting my comments, so this may seem a little cryptic.

So, even if you have gotten the whole (now OUT-OF-PRINT) US version of this show on DVD, you still only have, less than half of it, and a lot of questions don't get revealed until into the second season.  So, good luck getting the rest of it.
My suggestion, as of the end of 2011, is to find a copy of the fansubs somewhere... like BakaBT, nyaa, or some other location... google is your friend.  At least until some other distributor picks up the series for non-Japanese audiences.  Of course, when that happens, I recommend picking up the official DVDs.  Also, though there might be asian bootlegs out there, their quality SUCKS, and other than the first series, the subtitles are unforgivably bad.  Don't support the bootleggers!

FINAL NOTE: The real title of this show is ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.""  (I tried to put the Japanese Kanji in, but Amazon refuses it).  Translated it means roughly, ""When the Cicadas Cry.""  This is why it is called ""When They Cry,"" in the US, but that kind of leaves the wrong impression for those not aware of the full title.",1324857600,7,3759,4.674772036474164

What an I say about this series That I do not like... If there is only one thing it's the animation done by ""studio deen"" and it's so obvious where it falls flat but the series as a whole with it's story telling, sense of mystery and horror elements kick all of that out the window so I can care less if the animation drops a bit here and there. Not once in the entire time that I was watching this was I bored, EVER, I genially cared about every single character that came along ""even the main villain of the series"" This is one of the few series, That I can recommend to anyone that I personally and not feel weird about it, It is one of the few though that I do wish where Funimation would please finish off the (series) please just do it already Leaving off at a huge disarray of 29 episodes not brought over is not a good thing to do and people will go the other way if need be. This anime is about a guy named Keiichi Maebara who has moved to the country side with his parents in small town called Hinamizawa a small town with a population around 2000.

He adapts pretty quickly since he had a reason for wanting to leave his old home town but I will not spoil that for you. He makes friends with one of the main heroine's ""Rena Ryugu"", who has a fascination with cute things and quote ""wants to take them home"", since the town is so small everyone goes to the same school not matter what grade you are in so he is friends with mainly ""females"" but still it doesn't fall into the harem territory unless you want it to. Something called ""Oyashiro's curse"" ""the local deity there, has been taking place for the past five years, It is where some one dies and some one disappears from existence, but why who is doing this and for what reason? I would say more about it but that's no fun at all, that's for you to see. The town is dipped in traditional Japanese culture all over the place from the festival of departed souls to main head family and being ousted for what your family did even though your child, even with all of these barriers it is still so enjoyable to watch.

The main focus of the series if you watched the videos is the violence and murders but why is it happening what is the rational behind it? Also why does the story it's self (resets) every five to six episodes as well but play out differently? For some this might be a bit of set off but for others it adds more to the mystery of the series. If you truly want to find out why this happening or why people descend in to madness and kill their best friends for so little reasons.. then this is up your ally. This is in a true sense a good style of Japanese horror, even the creepy cicadas that ""cry"" or play their song set up a certain mood for things that are going to happen to break one's psyche. Now for those that are squeamish or hate the site of gore then venture far away from higurashi, it is not for the faint of hear or weak spirited. I hope this review was helpful, even though the series is no longer licensed try to obtain a legal copy if at all possible.",1311465600,,3517,4.176730486008837
3896028,5,B002BWD75U,"This series started out a ""choose your own path"" visual novel series for computers, ect. As such, probably the best way to portray all the subtleties and shreds of information you'd get on each ""path"" was to actually animate each scenario. You get a proper introduction to the characters in episode one, but after the story ends, things start over from certain points at the beginning.  At first it seems like having to relive a two week timeline over and over again will get tiresome, but each story manages to suck you in as the cliche, adorable, characters descend to psychosis. I remember reading a comment somewhere that someone made asking ""is there anyone in this series who ISN'T a psycho?""  I do agree with another reviewer though-you'll have to be a pretty ""well-rounded"" viewer to able to watch this.  You'll have to be able to stomach cutesy anime cliches, violence, and be able to tolerate alternate universes/scenarios.
I also honestly think having generic charcters works to it's advantage.  It compounds the sense of paranoia that permeates this series.  Who isn't really what they seem?  Who can you trust?  Who's lying to you?

The series is made of question arcs (cliff-hangers), and Answer arcs which either explains, or sheds more light on what was really happening in the respective question arc it solves.
This series will definately keep you guessing about who the real killer is.  Is something truely supernatural at work?  Is it a cabal of sinister girls with ""high-stakes"" games?  Is it the mafia, or is something else entirely going on?
You'll have to watch season two to find out for sure.",1296777600,,1618,4.868613138686132

If you like to think things through when you watch a movie and question things this anime is for you. If you like psychological thrillers then this anime is for you. Lastly if you like almost over the top cutesyness this anime is for you.
The catch is you have to like all of them or it might not work. People that don't want to think about shows that they watch will likely get confused. People that don't like to be scared and see blood will probably be appalled. Finally, people who only like cutesy stuff will probably also have nightmares. This show is NOT for kids.

However if your a little strange like the rest of us and like it all, then Higurashi is a great anime to watch.
you will learn to love the cute characters and how extremely well detailed their past lives connect with who they are currently. You will be shocked and horrified by how violent the cute characters become, Then you will question why and how such innocent characters took the actions that they took.
The only bad thing is that if you watch only the first season you will not be provided many answers. With this Anime you have to stick it out and watch the second season.",1296432000,,1260,4.294117647058823

All of us were engrossed by the story line, and the animation was top notch despite the fact that the anime originally aired in 2006.

3896032,5,B002BWD75U,"Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is an excellent psychological horror/mystery anime. It starts off looking like your typical Harem anime with one male protagonist surrounded by a cast of female characters, but boy does that image change. Your first clue is when you start hearing about the mystery of the Hinamizawa dam project that ended in a violent murder. Keiichi, the male protagonist begins to wonder about this murder, so he attempts to seek information from his friends Rena and Mion. He begins to question the credibility of his friends, because they seem to be hiding the dark truth from him. Eventually, Keiichi comes to the conclusion that he is going to have to prepare for one hell of a fight against his friends. I will leave it at that, because I don't want to spoil anything. To be honest, you will probably be wondering what the hell just happened after the first four episodes. Well, you might be a little confused throughout the first season, as you will get more and more pieces to the puzzle throughout the series. This season has a total of six chapters or arcs where you will see different versions of a similar story. As each chapter progresses you will obtain more and more clues to the crisis of Hinamizawa. The second season definitely has more of a central story line, and will explain everything that had you wondering in the first season. The problem is that Funimation has not dubbed the second season, and nobody really seems to know if they ever will. I really hope that Funimation will licence and dub the second season of Higurashi, because it is a fantastic season that will really clear up any confusion that you might have had about the first season.

3896033,5,B002BWD75U,"First and foremost I must state that the Higurashi series (both seasons) is one of my favorite shows of all time. However one should be warned that there is a second season, and if you don't watch it you won't understand all of what occured in the first season. Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is the first season (the second one being ... kai), both of which are based off of the visual novel by the same name. The first season encompasses the question arcs, and the question arcs alone. Unless you lurk online you probably won't guess exactly what's going on. However, the show is riveting. It will keep you in your seat. The animation, unlike the visual novel, is simply stunning. The final battle in the end of the season will leave you on the edge of your seat. If you haven't guessed at this point, this is NOT an anime for children. While the characters are cute and there are amusing moments, this is an anime that quickly becomes violent. And I don't mean Dragon Ball Z violent- closer to Elfen Lied. In short, it is graphic. While it may seem pointless to buy this, with the 2nd season not yet released, it was an amazing buy for me. I will say that I prefer the subtitles to the English dub, but that's hardly surprising. The case for this is a flimsy fold-out case. When I first opened it one of the DVDs had already fallen out of its place. Luckily, they all still play. While the case is more fragile, it's extremely small, making it nice for people with little space. The special features are nonexistent. One thing that I liked is how, on the back, it has the episodes grouped by arcs. This is a nice feature since they didn't bother keeping the original name. If you like this keep a look out for of course Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai, and then the sister series by the same group- Umineko no Naku Koro Ni. I would recommend watching through the first arc (first 4 episodes)online to decide whether or not to buy this. Do not buy a single DVD- collecting them that way will cost you 3-4 times as much as just buying this set. Of course as always wait until it is on sale, same with anything on amazon.

3896055,4,B002BWD75U,"Higurashi no naku kori ni(When they Cry) Is based on the Visual novels by Ryukishi07. Although the anime isn't a complete adaption of the books, for example they leave out a lot of the minor information and other things that are in the books that could give each arc a more complete feel. But at the same time could drag them on needlessly, so needless to say the creators essentially condensed all the important parts into the episodes in the boxset.

This is the question arc collection with the following inside.

Spirited Away by the Demon Chapter
Cotton Drifting Chapter
Curse Killing Chapter
Time Killing Chapter

Essentially speaking Higurashi is based in the rural town of Hinamizawa. The cast are a local bunch of children attending a local school where all the grades are essentially taught in the same room.

The series is more a murder mystery/drama/gore show. With each arc comes a new perspective and a new way a showing things, though some may view this as the same material over and over it exists to give you the viewer the mindset behind each characters actions in the show.

Hinamizawa is a closenit town the characters are all friends and respect and look out for each other. However each year someone is murdered by the towns people. They call this the curse of Oyashiro, although the God of Hinamizawa doesn't actually kill the people. Someone infected with Hinamizawa syndrome performs the act.

Although not introduced properly until Season 2 Hinamizawa Syndrome is revealed to be a disease exclusive to the local town and when infected the person begins to exhibit bizzare and violent behavior and dellusions. It's important explaining this because some people view When they Cry as a simple someone kills someone else and it resets show. It's not.

For example the first arc in this boxset. Keiichi believes that people are trying to kill him when infact he is in the advanced stages of Hinamizawa Syndrome and is experiencing paranoia/hallucinations. This later advances to the final stage which is the climax of the story and ultimately the fate of Keiichi will be revealed when you watch.

I know I tred a little in spoiler territory but it needs explaining before you buy. You can't trust what you're exactly seeing at times. What one character may be experiencing could infact be entirely in their heads.

This is what makes the anime so amazing. It makes you think. It makes you laugh, smile, and at the same time shocked when the violence occurs.",1287273600,3,2479,4.827830188679245
3896056,5,B002BWD75U,"Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is a very interesting anime, one that can keep you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the torture! The case itself is incredibly small, unlike I expected. About the size of a normal DVD case, even though it features 6 discs. So if you like large fancy box-sets I suppose this isn't for you.

Anyway, Higurashi itself is a series I would suggest to any horror or suspense fan. As long as you don't mind the constant retelling of a few things, but it really isn't that bad. This is because every few episodes the series is completely started over in a new ""arc"". Featuring a different set of psycho's and murders, varying story-lines (since it follows different main characters) and such. So like I said, the repetition of the main storyline doesn't get too bothersome.

If you want to try something new or just want to see what all the Higurashi fuss is about, please purchase this set! I really hope you enjoy it!",1286928000,,944,4.4508670520231215

If you're a die hard reader of H.P. Lovecraft's genius, and you like anime, you should see this series.

The only downside to this series is that in each ""chapter"" the story ""resets"" itself with the same setting and characters, but follows different continuity. This can be a little grating and can kill the suspensfulness overtime.",1285891200,,645,5.066037735849057
3896059,5,B002BWD75U,"AKA When They Cry or When the Cicadas Cry. For those who never watched this show, don't let the cutesy look and young characters fool you. This is a very dark and intense anime! From the moment the theme song kicked in I knew I was in for something. First off from what I remember from the first episode of the first season it starts out with someone getting killed right from the Getko. The show can get very brutal and gorey so its not for the week of heart. Trust me it gets gorey.

 The interesting part about Higurashi is that it was originally a japenese murder mystery game for Microsoft Windows Pc. Thier were also video games expanding on its story made for the PS2 and Nintendo Ds. Later a manga series was released in english and then later Studio Dean produced the two anime series for Higurashi. I've actually seen clips on youtube of people who own the game.

 What seperates Higurashi from a show like Elfin Lied is that its not just gorey but suspenseful and the characters have alot of depth to them. Some of the situations will pull at your heart strings or leave you confused or disturbed. You don't know who to trust, or what will happen next. Nothing is predictable.

 The plot is extremely complex and may leave many peaple confused, but thats all part of the fun. When you think you know the answer to whats going on or understand the series throw in twist that will leave you clueless.

 The first season of Higurashi consist mostly of events. Not many answers are being given yet. This changes in the second season and my favorite season Kai where alot of the gore of the first season is abandoned for awhile and replaced by mystery and thriller as answers of whats going on are slowly revealed. The big revelation is actually extremely shocking and my mind is still blown by all of it.

  I can find no other way to explain without giving away too much. Theres a total of 3 seasons I believe including another anime made by the same peaple and I heard is connected to Higurashi called Umineko no Naku Koro ni. I also must confess that I actually prefer the japenese dub. The English dub isn't bad, but the voices (laughs too) aren't as scary in English, plus the English voices didn't feel like they fit too well. Oh well to each his own.

 If you want to watch an anime thats like nothing out there Higurashi is the show for you. The theme song fits the dark tone of the series perfectly and from episode one you will be hooked.",1278288000,,2455,4.392935982339956

Then picture them with meat cleaver, hatchets, and even kitchen knives. Then they go on a psycho killing spree, including graphic torture. That's pretty much the series. It's entertaining, got a decent story, and is a wetdream for gorehounds that are into anime. Definitely check it out if you're a hardcore horror fan AND an anime fan.",1278115200,,474,4.9375
3896061,4,B002BWD75U,"When I finished watching When They Cry, I immediately started watching it again from the beginning. I can't recall the last time I did that - possibly never. But I was so fascinated and enthralled by the show that I had to see it again, to try to get a handle on the strange, elliptical story.

As you may have gathered from other reviews, this series is about a group of children in a small rural town. One or more of them becomes so desperate and/or insane that in the end people get killed. Then the story is ""reset"", and goes off in a different direction. These different arcs also have other subtle differences. The connections between the arcs, the similarities and differences, and the slowly building suspense as people's lives are endangered, all these factors make for a really fascinating show that has justly been widely praised.

However, on second viewing, when the suspense isn't as great because you know what to expect, the show's flaws become clearer. The pace of the story telling is extremely slow, and the characters make long speeches to each other about things we already know from the previous arcs. You really wish they would tighten the story up and get to the good bits. But, paradoxically, the factors that make second viewing dull are the same factors that make first viewing so suspenseful. I would have settled for less immediate suspense and more rewatch value, but that's just the way I am.

The first two arcs have been made into live-action movies in Japan, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the story is handled in these films. Hopefully the whole When They Cry story will eventually be treated this way - it could be a kind of anti-Harry Potter!

Unwary viewers must be warned, this show gets EXTREMELY violent, much more than the supposedly ultraviolent Elfen Lied. The ultra-disturbing quality is actually part of the entertainment value, as in ""This is so, so horrible that I just have to laugh,"" but obviously this kind of thing is NOT for everyone.

(By the way, my top choice for moe horror would probably be the complex, atmospheric Boogiepop Phantom. Please check it out if you haven't already.)

3896062,5,B002BWD75U,"A premise structured on that of a morbid Deja vu ideology and hidden behind some cutesy and at times chibi moments, is a surreal plot riddled with murder, mystery, and a general unsettling creepiness, that is maintained throughout the entire series. This series defines the phrase; things aren't as they appear to be. That being said, a comment should be made in regards to the gory scenes in this series. Though at times somewhat grotesque, these select scenes are used in relevance and stray from being overly gratuitous. To compliment this series further is an equally ominous soundtrack, one that fits the set mood to a tee. In addition to a superb English cast, there's the crisp style of animation that only accentuates this series beyond its already established stellar quality.

If in the mood for an eerie title to watch, one could not ask for a better choice then, When They Cry. Enjoy.",1273017600,,896,4.818181818181818
3896063,2,B002BWD75U,I ordered this thinking it would be really good because it got an average of five stars and I'm always looking for a good new anime to add to my collection. The fist four episode is one completed  story line. But the episodes after it were practically the same. The five main characters all take turns being murdered one way another. Then the next set starts and the character(s) who had just died in the last episode is alive again. Its like a reset button was hit and they are giving you all different ways they can die.  It also raised more questions then it answered. All in all I wouldn't recommend this for all those hard core anime fans,1272499200,3,643,4.35

8362068,4,B002BWD75U,"Transfer student Keniichi Maebara has grown a liking to his new town, the quiet village Hinamizawa. He becomes fast friends with four girls around his age. Although the town appears to be quite the humble place, it contains deadly secrets that can and does affect people's lives. -summary

When They Cry is a series that surprised me upon my initial viewing, and I will admit that when I first saw it years ago my expectations were terribly low due to its stylistic similarities to Elfen Lied. One thing among many that Elfen Lied did terribly was the meshing of its genres. The comedy clashed with the violent content and the fan service clashed with the horror. Therefore in the end, I couldn't take any of it seriously. This anime doesn't suffer from that tonal whiplash.

When They Cry is superior to EL in every way by balancing its features. The comedy is well paced and it isn't presented to ""lighten up"" the mood. The comedy normally takes place in the beginning of an arc, and it actually works into the characters three dimensional development. It's meant to establish the kid's innocence and care free nature. This form of development may not be the best, but it did make the characters fun to watch on some occasions. However, when things become serious, this anime maintains the right tempo through well paced suspense, story build up, and definitely mystery.

The plot follows a group of friends as they find themselves falling victim to their town's curse, in which a person dies and another disappears during a festival that takes place each year. Some of them don't believe in it despite weird occurrences taking place; while others are convinced to the point of obsession and paranoia.

The meat of the series for me has to be the story and plot. The anime is broken up into six chapters using a horror-mystery backdrop. This is where the series takes some getting use to. At first, it utilizes a repetitive story and plot elements that becomes quite predictable. Normally, I hate this method of storytelling, but it actually works here for several reasons: For one, the stories continue to add background and present different, in-depth perspectives to the character's backgrounds and motives. Second, the stories are just plain interesting with the focus being on different individuals. Finally, the ending ties up everything making sense of it all in the process, and believe me, the ending is very strong because things feel quite weird nearly throughout the entire trip.

The series tells its tale by exploring the myths surrounding the villages history and traditions. I found the anime to be gripping once the plots began, and I believe the horror elements worked out rather well. The anime did a great job exercising its themes such as paranoia, deceit, manipulation, revenge, and obsession.

One of the elements that most fans mention about the series is the violence. The violence in the series can be very over the top, but it doesn't take place to carry or mask an incoherent plot. It also isn't used as a cheap and repetitive gimmick like a certain title out there. The violence is meant to shock the viewer, and I do believe it's effective along with supporting its themes.

The characters will work for some folks, but at times they were too saccharine for my taste. I understand the reasons for combining cute with violent. Still, this is an approach that can spell disaster for some, and I found a couple of the characters detestable on certain occasions. Overall, they are well developed and actually benefit the story.

The series does a great job handling its soundtrack and sound effects. The sounds of the cicadas adds to the series atmosphere creating a sense of ambiance when it's needed. The soundtrack also works well making the drama and even the horror stand out a tad bit more. Although my feelings are slightly mixed here; I enjoyed the artwork concerning the beautiful backgrounds but the character designs really didn't do a thing for me. The animation really wasn't anything special either. However, I must give props to the violence, when someone is getting smashed to pulp with a pipe, it can be quite disturbing.

Overall, When They Cry is definitely something hardcore anime fans should see. I think the series did its job in delivering a gripping experience. Some people think multiple watches are needed to fully get the story but I disagree there; the twists are nothing very special and a single viewing should be enough, yet I do think the ending is one of those ""wow"" moments. Personally, I don't think it's the masterpiece some may consider it. I didn't find the comedy funny in the least, and I do think the characters could have been developed differently. In any case, the only people I would advise against watching this are those whom despise this type of style. If you need 100% serious, tonal consistency with adult character designs in your anime, then it would be a very good move to skip this.

Highs: Well use of horror elements, becomes more focused later

Lows: Unfunny comedy, style will completely put of certain types of anime fans",1436486400,,5109,4.827428571428571
8362069,5,B002BWD75U,"I was lucky enough to purchased this box set for the cheapest price i've seen in years since watching this anime a few years ago so I'll finally write a review of this box set.

The box container that is included is made of that cardboard material as some box sets come in, so the corners can easily tear/rip, but its still very sturdy. The front of the box shows the offset picture of Rena and Mion and on the back just shows information on the anime and the usual credits.
The set includes 3 thin cases and each with 2 discs with a total of 6. The each front and back covers of the cases are different and show pictures of the main characters. Inside the case is transparent and you're able to see the other side of the case covers with the episode and arc information.

As for the anime, its well known that the story is a bit crazy even when it seems cute at times or there's no need to explain the plot again. I personally love this anime and would recommend it for anyone who loves a psychotic horror mystery.

Cons:
Since this box set is one of those cardboard-y material, the corners can easily get torn if not handled carefully, so be wary

I don't know if its just my copy (purchased used), but the disc slots in the cases seem to be not very sturdy and the discs can easily pop out. I personally don't mind this much since the thin cases doesn't allow the discs to jumble about

Pros:
The design of this box set is beautiful and the cover would definitely catch some peoples eyes

I like the design of the individual cases, showing a different picture on the front and back.

The thin packaging makes it easier to store and shelve

Overall:
I highly recommended you get this box set and its great for any collector. Although there are 2 other different cases like that Limited Edition Art Box Set and the Viridian Collection, I still like the art of this box far more but that's just personal opinion. If you are able to find this set at a very low price, I'd advise you to buy it since this anime is out of print!

I do own the bootleg version that I bought for ebay a couples years back, and in honestly, I believe the video quality is no different. So if you're really egging on owning this anime for just $30, feel free to. Obviously the bootleg version would not include the extra features and the case would not even compare to the official. But I would highly recommend owning an official because there's no better feeling than owning one. :)

8362070,4,B002BWD75U,"Good, but not $200 good. I bought this in 2010 for about $50 and it's extremely entertaining and unique among anime for it's blending of horror and more typical anime tropes. I suppose it's gone up so much in price because it's out of print now, and would not recommend spending this kind of money on it unless you're a really hardcore collector. Otherwise, I would try to watch it online somewhere if possible. I don't know why it's not on Crunchyroll.com. Be careful of ""free"" anime sites as they often can have malware hidden in their advertisements. Also, something that stays this popular even after it's out of print is bound to make a comeback as one of those Anime Classic/Superstar reprints. If/when that happens, hopefully the price will come back down. But for $200, there's just too many other great anime that cost far less that you can buy and enjoy just as much.",1412467200,,877,4.628205128205129

8362072,5,B002BWD75U,"Don't let the case fool you by it saying this is the ""Complete Box set"" because it is not. There are two seasons and this is only one. It is because Funimation never dubbed the second season and seem to not be attending to currently. Which is a REAL shame since there's SO much more in the second season and everything is answered. The only way you can watch the second season is online since not only the fact its not dubbed and on this set, but it seems you can't even buy a Japanese box set of it anywhere to buy. If you don't mind blowing 200 dollars for a incomplete series, then go for it. But if you want the whole story then its not a set for you because you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong this is an awesome anime, not for children and VERY creepy and gory to the max but it has an amazing plot filled with complex twists and turns.

8362075,4,B002BWD75U,"Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, or When the Cicadas Cry in the English version, is a murder mystery/psychological horror anime which is based off a visual novel of the same name by the great Ryukishi07. It has a relatively unique storyline which follows several story arcs that are essentially repeats of the same events, the days leading up to and following a yearly festival called The Cotton Drifting Festival, which is far darker and more sinister than it initially appears to be. Every arc follows the main characters, Keiichi, Mion, Shion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika and their daily interactions with each other during their club games, and afterwards when things start to take a turn for the worse during the annual cotton drifting festival. Each separate arc focuses on a different character, usually Keiichi, but occasionally the others, and how they are related to the mysterious, gruesome events which transpire over the course of the series. Each arc usually starts out all sunny and optimistic but within two or three episodes quickly becomes far more frightening as the pasts of the characters and their mental states become revealed and unhinged due to the supposed ""curse"" of Oyashiro, the local patron god of Hinamizawa who's ""shrine"" is full of instruments of torture and dismemberment.

I'll admit, Higurashi was the first anime to genuinely scare me, something that I would have not believed had I not seen it for myself. Overall, while there are many strong points to this series, there are also a few negatives, most notably the awful character designs and quality of the animation itself, which feels far more suited to a lighthearted slice of life or comedy series like Lucky Star or Sgt. Frog than a sadistic horror series. However, when it needs to, the series usually pulls through with the notable exception of the famous ""ladder scene. If you've seen the series you know what I'm talking about, and a few other scenes which I won't spoil. Overall, Higurashi is an exceptional series and my all time favorite anime. If you enjoy horror and mystery and are not easily shocked or frightenend, I highly suggest you check this anime out. You won't regret it.",1383868800,,2173,4.920980926430517
