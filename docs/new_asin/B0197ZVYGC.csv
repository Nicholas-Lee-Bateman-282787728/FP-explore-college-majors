8744371,5,B0197ZVYGC,I was on flight to Ft. Lauderdale on Delta and saw this movie.  It is a great movie.  My only problem is that I could not see the ending because we were landing.  I tried to see if they had it on my way to New York but they did not.  I was very sad.  It is a very funny movie and I tried to laugh quietly during the flight.  I am still searching to see if I could watch the ending without spending so much money.,1466035200,2,412,3.67816091954023
