5080330,5,B007F4UHMA,"Dozens of Titanic videos have appeared in this 100th anniversary of the ill-fated maiden journey of 1912. Some of the details of the sinking have been well-reported and made movies of, but some remain obscure. Here is a remarkable historical document about the not-so-visible third class passengers from one community in Ireland. The testimony was given by three ladies who survived the accident as children. They made it to America and had families. Their descendants tell the story here. There are interviews with the family members as well as with individuals of the present day Irish community Addergoole. 14 natives of the area, young men and women, after selling all that they owned in Ireland, sailed with third class tickets, in search of the dream-world of opportunity. Three survived, but were having traumatic syndrome throughout their lives, from the tragic deaths they witnessed and the 'sinking' experience. Their descendents tell the whole story. It is a story of disbelief and shock.",1350777600,11,999,5.211180124223603
5080331,4,B007F4UHMA,"Please be aware this is presented in documentary style and is by no stretch of the imagination a movie on this topic. I have a real interest in the human stories & family histories of the third class passengers on the Titanic and found this really fascinating viewing. This may not be of interest to everyone as it really is a historical documentary based on only a particularly small group of third class Irish passengers from the small community of Addergoole in the county Mayo and comes with ""no bells and whistles"" to spruce it up to lightweight entertainment of a historical nature. Recommended for people who are really interested in the individual  backgrounds on the ""whys and wherefores"" of the sadly overlooked poorer third class passengers. I found it very disturbing that ruthless representatives of White Star line coerced and harassed the three seriously ill hospitalized survivors of the ""Adergoole 14"" to sign a waiver for personal compensation so they were only entitled to a sum total of $25.00 each; a sad and oh so classic example of how third class was so shabbily treated by White Star Line during and after the Titanic disaster.",1349740800,15,1152,4.877551020408164
5080332,5,B007F4UHMA,"I found this documentary to be very interesting. Of course, I'm biased because my husband's family members are featured in the film - Anne McGowan was his great-grandmother who survived the sinking.",1345075200,6,198,5.21875

8515536,1,B007F4UHMA,"NOT the doc you want to start with at all. I actually took the DVD out a few minutes in knowing I shouldn't because the next scene may get better, but.....in the 1/2 hour I watched I thought, ""oh man...why did I buy this one...dang!"" Not to be hyper-insensitive or crass, but, I don't care about the Irish immigrents (mispelled?). I just want something, anything different about the last 2 hour forty minute terror that happened that calm, cold night. But I guess that's why we have these docs, because they are very different then the last, but if you are wondering and thinking, ""i'll just give it a chance""...Don't! Just try YouTubin it.",1392163200,,640,4.62280701754386
