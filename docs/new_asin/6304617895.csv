7875076,2,6304617895,"I obtained this workout by purchasing the ""Seven Days, Seven Workouts"" dvd set.  This particular set is not known for having good workouts (I personally love the Total Body Tone segment, the Step segment and the Latin Dance Party 101 instruction tape).  I have heard rave reviews for this workout and after doing it, I respectfully disagree with them.

The outdoor setting and music that accompanies the workout are fantastic and the only reason this workout got any stars from me.  I also like that the instructor speaks both English and Spanish so the workout breaks more language barriers.  The content, however, leaves A LOT to be desired.

Firstly, her breathing technique in the warmup is strange.  I don't feel as though I'm breathing as deeply as I could while making my arm movements overly complex.  The warmup itself isn't easy to follow so perhaps I should've seen this as foreshadowing.

The first aerobic segment had the usual mambos, box steps, cha chas and hip swings.  There is a mambo that twists and jerks the knees to the point where someone could easily hurt themselves and it's not the easiest to follow (choreography-wise).

The second aerobic segment is where I had the most difficulty.  It began with a complicated foot maneuver that I don't believe could be mastered due to not seeing the move from different angles (that's the case with many moves, sadly).  Many of the moves were jerky, taught out of order (she would teach you a move and then teach another move afterward saying ""This is the move you do before the previous move"") and her instructions were mainly in spanish ONLY.  By the time both segments were to be combined and done a few times, I was left confused and frustrated.  Even though I sweat quite a bit, I didn't feel accomplished or empowered by the end.

Finally, THERE WAS NO AEROBIC COOLDOWN.  Yvette merely states via voiceover that it would be a good idea to walk around the room for a while and have a glass of water before beginning the meditation/stretch segment.  The stretch itself was very sparse and did little to curb the frustration.

I think this would be a good video for those who easily catch on to complex Latin choreography, those who somewhat understand Spanish verbal cues and those who don't mind participants who don't show the movements from all angles.  I can safely say that this workout is not for me.",1394409600,,2375,4.732360097323601
