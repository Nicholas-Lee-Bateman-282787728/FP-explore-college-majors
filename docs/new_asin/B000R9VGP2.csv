8199730,5,B000R9VGP2,"This is a beautiful DVD, where the lovely Lila Downs  performances from Sala Nezahuacoyotl(Mexico City) and Macedonia Alcala Theater(Oaxaca City)  are edited artfully into a theme based on the Mexican game Loteria. Lila's music, coupled with the stunning visual imagery reveals the artists conscience; her moral compass is right on target. The songs chosen for this DVD are some of her best, taken from albums like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Border-La-Linea/dp/B00005LNE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Border (La Linea)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Una-Sangre-One-Blood/dp/B00023GFT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Una Sangre (One Blood)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tree-of-Life/dp/B00004X0PS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tree of Life</a>&nbsp;and  many of which have political overtones but all connect, regardless of politics, with a deep human connection. This is a powerful DVD with amazing imagery of Mexican life and landscapes that compliments Lila's stunning voice and charismatic persona. Lila Downs is a sensual, spiritual experience on stage that is not to be missed. There are times when the screen becomes a little too busy with effects and cutaway edited shots of Mexican life. I say this because  having seen Lila Downs perform live many times, it is safe to say, that the show is spectacular in and of itself.  However, in the final analysis, the ""artsy"" effects mezmerize in a technical way, whereas, Lila hipnotizes with her shamanic, organic dancing presence and a voice that seizes all your senses and shakes and grabs you to your very core. When the production values and Lila intersect in perfect harmony, the results can be marvelous. Such is the case with ""La Iguana"" and the spectacular ""La Lllorona"" where Lila's high notes transcend and take you on another plain. The closing number is probably the best. It is called ""Viborita"" and is a street concert in Oaxaca that is visually amazing. It was shot with costumed Oaxacan people, some with Day of The Dead outfits, dancing and having fun while Lila is casting her spell. The extras on the DVD include several additional songs and videos, how to play loteria, and most notably, a short film entitled"" Love Shots"" and a revealing short documentary, about the band and life on the road entitled ""En el camino/On the road."" It's an amazing life. Unfortunately this disc is not available at Amazon but it is available on Lila Downs website at a very reasonable price. I would defintely recommend this disc to any fan of Lila Downs or someone interested in world music.",1210291200,6,2685,5.874358974358974
