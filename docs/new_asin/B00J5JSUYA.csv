6333870,4,B00J5JSUYA,"Only four episodes.  Just got our family's.  The spine of the DVD says ""Ninjago - Battle for New Ninjago City - Season Three - Part One"" -- 92 minutes running time.  Boo.

But at the time I bought this, it didn't clearly state on this webpage how MANY episodes there were.  So...yes there are FOUR.

The four episodes are:
1.  The Surge
2.  The Art of the Silent Fist
3.  Black Out
4.  The Curse of the Golden Master

Extremely fast shipping.  Looking very forward now to Season Three - Part Two ....whenever THAT comes out.

Update:  After watching, the episodes ARE awesome like we knew they'd be.  My husband and son thought they were better than Season one and two.  My daughter and I didn't.  Still love Season One and Two the best.  I felt like they were slamming too much action and not enough humor into these...or some unequal balance like that.  Season One and Two balanced action and humor perfectly.  This season felt to me (and my daughter) like they were trying to pack a LOT of action into our faces as quick as possible.  My husband and son said we didn't know what we were talking about.  lol.  It'll be interesting to see what others' opinions are about these.",1407369600,26,1178,4.427230046948357

6333994,3,B00J5JSUYA,"This is not the whole season, it's only four of at least eight episodes in this season, ""Rebooted"". I've seen these episodes a bunch of times, but haven't seen the others as much due to some unresolved issue with my Xfinity. We have not been able to see the 'last' episodes of this new season, for some odd reason. But I was not the most satisfied with these episodes because I'm not really getting that much out of a new thing that I've been excited for. In all the other DVDs you can find from Ninjago, you get the WHOLE season. This one's only a half (as far as I know).

P.S. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that my mom got me this; I love Ninjago. But I would recommend waiting until (and if) Lego releases the complete season. You'll be getting more bang for your buck.
