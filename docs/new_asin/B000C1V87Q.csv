8095044,2,B000C1V87Q,"The only good thing I can say about this is Elisabeth Soderstrom as Leonore.  The rest of the characters did nothing for me.  Rocco has to get rid of the hat and glasses.  Elizabeth Gale (Marzelline) needs to learn how to finish getting dressed.  If you want a first class traditional Fidelio get the one conducted by Bernstein with Gundula Janowitz as Leonore.  Other good traditional Fidelios on DVD include Bohm with Gwyneth Jones; Rother with Christa Ludwig; Ludwig (conductor) with Anja Silja,",1445990400,,498,4.951807228915663
8095045,4,B000C1V87Q,"This is a traditional and generally enjoyable production.  It will be easier to note its few faults than its many merits, but please note this is not meant as a negative review.

The villain Don Pizarro is hard to take seriously because he's a hammy actor, and his German is not very good.  Who would be afraid of a bad guy who snarls German with an English accent, but sounding more like bad Italian?  It is a noticeable distraction here.

Jaquino has a neat, blow-dried 1970s' college boy haircut (no wonder Marzellina wasn't interested in him!) ...

And worst problem of all is the prisoners' makeup.  They look like escapees from Night of the Living Dead.  Seriously, it's as if someone was trying to make a zombie movie, spoofing opera.  It's one thing to make the prisoners look pitiful, but no need to resort to shock value for its own sake.  So really, is half of that prisoner's face burned black, or is it simply a mass of bruises?  Come on folks, sometimes less is more!

And Florestan is supposed to be the most far-gone of all the prisoners, so, just curious, why does he look in far better shape than all the rest?

Well, even with those distractions it's a pretty good production, possibly second only to Bernstein's traditional production (although I'm still looking for a perfect Fidelio with zero issues :)",1397952000,,1324,4.630901287553648
8095046,5,B000C1V87Q,"It is a mystery to me how we deserve Beethoven.  The first time I saw Fidelio -- I had known it only in recordings before then -- was at a Sunday morning performance in the old opera house in Budapest ca. 1987.  This was before the fall of the Iron Curtain.  Every chord, every note still sends a thrill through me.  Soderstrom is a favorite of mine, which is why I chose to buy this DVD, but the rest of the Glyndebourne cast is excellent.  As is Haitinck as conductor.  I cannot speak to the competing versions, but I love this one.  Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, and highly recommended.",1379894400,3,598,4.431192660550459
8095047,5,B000C1V87Q,"This DVD could be the standard for other performances.  The cast is very good, with the exception of Ms. Soderstrom who is outstanding.  This recording should be in every opera-lovers stash.",1364774400,,190,5.096774193548387
8095048,4,B000C1V87Q,"I own the VHS tape version, and must say that it is quite wonderful.  I wish one could uniformly find good, solid, traditional productions of all of the standard operas on video, but this has become quite the exception rather than the rule.  Later, we can check out the productions from the directors who can't keep their egos in check.  I might buy a ticket to see their shenanigans once, but for the long haul, give me this.  A relatively young Haitink keeps it moving along, and everyone sings well.
If you only know the piece from CDs go for this one.
Oh, and the Leonore #3  would have been played after the climax, before the last scene, when we've already heard the trumpet calls.  Gustav Mahler may have thought it released the tension, and made the jump to the finale less abrupt.  Playing in the opera was his idea.",1199750400,7,825,4.46
8095049,4,B000C1V87Q,"One never fails to be moved by the great humanity of Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio, in which the wife of a political prisoner dresses as a man, hires on as a jailer in the prison where her husband is kept in a dungeon, and manages to save his life. What a pity Beethoven wrote only one opera. But what an opera it is.

This Glyndebourne Opera 'Fidelio' from 1979 preserves a marvelous naturalistic production directed by Sir Peter Hall and with Bernard Haitink leading the London Philharmonic. In the cast is one of the great spinto sopranos of the day, Elisabeth Sderstrm, who gives us a stirring performance both musically and dramatically. She thrills us in her big first act aria 'Komm Hoffnung.' (And it must be said that the four horns who accompany her are in good form, too, although one was a little  concerned because they were a bit sour in the overture. Obviously they had settled in by the time 'Komm Hoffnung' came around. Indeed that is true of the orchestra which got off to a rocky start but soon righted themselves.) The supporting cast is excellent although I did not encounter very many familiar names besides the always reliable Elizabeth Gale as Marzelline. Ian Caley's Jacquino is suitably light and flighty. Curt Appelgren's Rocco, the head jailer, was really quite wonderful. He managed to make the seemingly inappropriate paean to wealth, 'Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben' tolerable. And in the dungeon scene he was both believable and musically stalwart. Robert Allman's Don Pizarro, dressed like a little Napoleon complete with tricorn, was a suitably hateful villain, and he brought to the role a resounding bass-baritone voice. It's not easy to make Pizarro's self-aggrandizing solos believable but Allman managed to do that.

The big surprise for me was the excellent Florestan of a singer I don't recall ever hearing of before, tenor Anton de Ridder. He was rather long in the tooth for the part; the booklet notes that at the time of this performance he had already been singing thirty years at the Karlsruhe Opera. But his voice and presentation reminded me of Jon Vickers' who, of course, was a standout in the role, and being compared to Vickers is great praise indeed.

The sets and costumes are appropriate to the period in which the opera was written, rather than to 16th-century Spain (where so many late 18th and early 19th century operas were set in order to avoid the state censors' wrath); this is quite acceptable because Bouilly's play, on which 'Fidelio' is based, was taken from a set of real-life events that happened during the French Revolution.

The 'Leonore No. 3' Overture is not played before Act II in this production and that is good. I've never understood the need or even the impulse for it to be played during a performance of 'Fidelio' except that it is wonderful music. But it does tend to give away the plot with the trumpet call announcing the arrival of the opera's deus ex machina in the form of the Minister who has Pizarro arrested and Florestan set free.

Since this was originally a videotaped recording from 1979 both visual and audio fidelity are of the time. The sound is slightly congested but not distractingly so and the picture quality is acceptable. The important thing here is the production and the performance, and they are wonderful. They are not perhaps the equal of the more recent Metropolitan DVD that features Karita Mattila, Ren Pape and Ben Heppner under James Levine, but it costs only about 60% of that DVD, so that's a consideration.

Bottom line: Worth the investment if you're a lover of Fidelio as I am. (And I also happen to love Elisabeth Sderstrm as well, so that's a bonus.) I've given it four stars only because of the slightly dated audio and video, but they are not a big issue, in my opinion.
