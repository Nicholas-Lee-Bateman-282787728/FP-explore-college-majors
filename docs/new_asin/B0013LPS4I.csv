8251798,3,B0013LPS4I,"Although I am super happy with the animation and story, I bought this for my Japanese girlfriend who was taking a stop animation class and I was super excited that the narration would be by Kishida Kyouko from Suna no Onna.  My girlfriend needs subtitles for English, either in English or Japanese.  The fact that the narration (which is the bulk of the dialogue) is not subtitled, a legend is overdubbed without option, and that is not stated on the dvd is making me try to find a Japanese version.  Bad form.",1364774400,5,510,4.521739130434782
8251799,5,B0013LPS4I,"What a beautiful fable! It's rooted in historical fact. Prince Otsu was forced to commit suicide in 686 because he was falsely convicted through the machinations of Empress Jito who wanted her son Kusakabe to take the throne. 686 is known as the year of Sucho, the red phoenix, the one which is resurrected from the dead -- the king whose innocent sacrifice cleanses his people. Otsu did write a poem about crying ducks, and he is famous for the poems he wrote to Lady Ishikawa.

The capital is deteriorating. Dry grass grows by the streets and on it people are building walls of packed earth rather than stone. They do not protect their inhabitants from the demands of the world. Lady Iratsume's walls are still of stone, but there is a crack and suitors seep in.

Her true father has been exiled to the south by his brother (Emi no Oshikatsu, who also seeks Iratsume's hand). But he still can send her the Sutra which starts her on her journey. The other of her suitors is Yakamochi, played at times by the same doll as Otsu. Yakamochi sees the Buddha in all things, including Emi no Oshikatsu, but the opposite is true of Emi no Oshikatsu, who sees peasants even in the nobility and warns him away from his niece.

In order to enter the spirit world, Iratsume must violate a worldly taboo -- in this case she enters a domain closed to women, and an inner sanctum closed even to men. In other respects as well, she does not recognize the structures of this world. She refuses her station as a noblewoman in becoming learned. And when asked what her clan and lineage is, she doesn't understand.

But family she understands, because what are many in the physical realm are one in the spiritual realm. Prince Otsu IS Yakamochi. Lady Ishikawa IS Iratsume (and also I suspect the storyteller). The cloth she weaves in the end has only one figure -- the Buddha, but those who look on it see many different figures. This theme runs throughout.

Mount Futakami, where Otsu was in fact buried by his priestess sister, has two peaks, like the Egyptian Djew which holds up the heavens and symbolizes the tomb. The sun set on the equinox symbolizes the transition to the spirit realm, and also Otsu's death.

She begins her journey on the equinox, and she sees the Face of God on the equinox -- her love for Otsu is consummated, and she becomes the virgin mother. She gives birth to the Buddha in the form of a cloth made of lotus stems. It is both a burial cloth and the lotus flower -- symbol of divine birth -- which is brought about by the repeated purification (soaking) and abstinence (drying), which strengthens the yarn and brings her to a new level of understanding.

And through this process of sacrifice of the most pure and divine virgin birth, the whole village is brought back into harmony -- made to laugh again and involved in the process.",1340755200,3,2845,4.53411306042885
8251800,4,B0013LPS4I,"This movie is not what I was expecting. I still enjoyed it, I don't regret buying it, but I'm a bit more open minded about some things. It is not dark, or eerie, it is not like the Nightmare Before Christmas in it's animation, other than they use the same stop motion camera work to produce it.  The review titled Buddhist Fable is misleading in that sense, but it's description is accurate on everything else. If there was a rating on this, it would be ""G"". It is acceptable for small children to watch.",1269302400,,504,4.361702127659575
8251801,5,B0013LPS4I,"Everything about this stop animation works beautifully. The puppets themselves have more personality and individuality than some live actors I can name. Painted backgrounds, when they appear, are the best I've seen since some from the big studios of the 1930s. Models to go with the puppets are exquisitely made. A puppet works a model loom in one passage, and I'm convinced that the model actually works. Motion is some of the most elegant I've seen in stop animation - robes even flutter convincingly in the non-existent wind.

The story itself does not reveal itself easily, at least not to a Western eye. It follows a high-born daughter of a major feudal house, religious retreat, and a boddhisattva transcending life and death. This arises not only from a wholly Japanese cultural and historical background, but from a long tradition of Buddhist thought and myth. As a result, I can only appreciate this as a cultural outsider. The ending, clearly a crescendo in the story, carries meanings that eluded me. I am not criticizing - far from it, I appreciate the depths of the story, even if I can't see all the way into them myself. That just adds a wonderful, foreign sense of mystery to the technical mastery of this amazing movie.

8251802,3,B0013LPS4I,"A wonderful production, I have no complain about that. However, my disappointment came from the narration part. The original one was done by late great Kyoko Kishida, who was the actress did ""Woman in the Dune"", and her mysterious voice should have been so suitable for this kind of story, yet it was replaced with an English narration by some unknown actress. I do not say that English narration is bad, but at least we should be given a choice for the original Japanese one or the English one. And strangely enough all other dialogues are subtitled and there is no choice to turn off that either. On the back of the case, it is said that the subtitle is optional, but it is not true. I do not know why Kino Video did this way. If they wanted to overdub this, they should have done the entire thing, and then given us a choice. This is so stupid and disapponting to me although I still recommend this beautiful animation.",1247875200,20,922,4.429411764705883
8251803,5,B0013LPS4I,"Although we are all familiar with three dimensional animation, either in the stop-motion style of Tim Burton or the computer designed efforts of
Pixar, Kihachiro Kawamoto's films are unique.  He combines original puppets, Noh masks, traditional Japanese flute/ string melodies, natural sounds, lovely textiles, and Asian watercolor paintings to tell his stories. Altogether, it is a richly visual experience.

This movie is the tale of Japanese noble lady who leaves her home in search of a spiritual vision whereas that same vision is in search of an earthly experience.  To see this film is to be immersed in Japanese textures and rhythms.  Lovely, sensual, and exotic...and highly recommended.",1213142400,13,696,5.416666666666667
