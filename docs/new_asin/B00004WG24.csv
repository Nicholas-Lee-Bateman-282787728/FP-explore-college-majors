3 reasons to buy the series. I always wanted to have to this, besides the fact it is a year 2000 dvd anime, it is a wonderful piece in my collection.",1395964800,,303,3.9672131147540983
7925053,5,B00004WG24,This little anime one-shot is one of the best skewerings of the Japanese magical-girl / ghost-story type of anime. You will laugh all the way through it. This is the anime with the most ... um ... err ... AWESOME NAKED COSTUME CHANGE in all of Japanese anime. You have to see it to believe it.,1375228800,,293,4.25

7925055,4,B00004WG24,"The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because you really have to come up with something great to get 5 in my book.  This OAV is shounen beyond any shadow of a doubt, so the vast majority of female otaku will get no enjoyment out of this DVD(see prude's review above).  When you sit down to make a great shounen what do you need?  Comedy, hot chicks and that intangible that makes you want to watch it over and over again.  The OAV certainly is funny, but earned the 16up rating it recieved, lots of sexual humor(which is a plus).  Kocho and Korin are both obviously hot, so that's another plus(it ties into the comedic aspects really well).  And it certainly has the intangible.  The outtakes are incredibly funny, especially the lady doing Kocko's voice.  It's the worst of the dubs compared to the original voices, but man she is funny.  They also have a cast party showing it with the cast goofing off while showing it.  The only movie I've ever given 5 stars was Macross: Do You Remember Love(not to be confused with Crash of the Bionoids, I mean the REAL DYRL).  This is well worth the price of the DVD, especially considering the Japanese import without the extras runs over [dollar amount].  Very strongly recommended.",1017792000,5,1225,4.54337899543379
7925056,5,B00004WG24,"this anime is cool it is a great movie for both boys and girls. mostly boys,because of the nude scences. ok so it's great for boys, but i'm am a girl and i love this anime. if you have seen ramna 1/2, fushigi yugi, or any other animes like that you'll love this movie. other things you should know if you love demons you will love this anime.
if you are buying this anime for your kid, my rating would be for kids 13 and older.
i mean, kids see this stuff more then you think, not only from animes but from other movies too.
but if you are getting it for your self enjoy it
ive got to go now so just buy it
you'll like trust me",1011916800,4,627,3.868217054263566
7925057,2,B00004WG24,"For the price I paid, I expected there to be more than thirty minutes of anime and over an hour of ""behind the scenes"" outtakes of the dubbing voice actors. The outtakes left much to be desired, and my husband & I were left wanting when the anime was over after thirty short minutes. The storyline is funny and interesting, and our heroine, Kocha spends most of the anime wearing absolutly nothing.",981676800,2,398,4.541666666666667
7925058,2,B00004WG24,"This is not a great video.  For one thing, it is only one half-hour episode.  Worse, it is basically a rip-off of Devil Hunter Yohko (which cannot be a surprise, with a title like that), only not as good.  It is not as funny, nor are the fights as good.  About the only thing going for this video is that it has a healthy dose of nudity, more than Yohko.  I don't regard this title as a complete waste for that reason, but there are videos that succeed in that department and also have more going for them, like Cutey Honey.  Get that before you bother with this.",976492800,,563,4.166666666666667
