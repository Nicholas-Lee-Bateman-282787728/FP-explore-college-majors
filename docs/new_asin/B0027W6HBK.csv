8355176,5,B0027W6HBK,"I love this movie! I call it a ""Christian techno-thriller"". It exhorts Christians to speak up and it calls non-Christians to consider that life is fleeting so they should repent and flee to Christ.

It's good for all ages. We watch it again and again.

Thanks to all those who made this excellent film on a very limited budget.

May God use it and bless it around the world!",1280188800,2,374,4.391304347826087
8355177,2,B0027W6HBK,"I've watched many movies that try to convey a Christian message, and this has to be the oddest one I've ever seen. A man has the opportunity to contact people who will die in two days, including his wife, with a phone that can contact people in the past. The lighting is dim and the continuity from scene to scene is choppy and difficult to follow in several progressions of the plot. It's only about 40 minutes long and I think they could have cut out a lot of it (especially the parts of the rat running around which added nothing to the story) and still have gotten the message (share the gospel) across. I liked the ending with the business meetings and the counsel to the man served with divorce papers, and it did have an important message, but I can't recommend it as highly as other films.",1278201600,3,797,4.355704697986577
