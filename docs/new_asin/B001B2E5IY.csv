3479970,5,B001B2E5IY,"very good and fair show in describing how all parties felt about this man and his actions.  This show even allows one to consider that Mengele was human, and probably lost a lot due to his actions.  Sad but good show.",1390953600,,217,4.2682926829268295
3479971,5,B001B2E5IY,"This is one of the best documentaries on WWII-Hitler era Nazism. Anyone who would rate this less than the maximum is not familiar with the topic or has an agenda. This ranks at the top of the list with ""Nazis: A Warning from History"" and the first-hand interviews with Hitler's secretary. Regarding Mengle, this program is better than the series ""Auschwitz"" in that it does not rely on any recreated scenes or third-hand commentary and is chock full of primary source material.

You get to see first-hand interviews with Mangle's family members and associates and victims. It was made in the 1980s and so of course is not going to be at the standard of video and computer-generated imagery that is available today. But what you can't do today is interview all those first-hand witnesses and victims most of whom are now deceased.

This is a must-see for anyone seriously interested in studying Hitler-era Nazism and the factual accounts of the actual people involved in making history -- horrific history.",1386806400,2,1005,4.905882352941177
3479972,4,B001B2E5IY,"I gave it this rating but not because it was good entertainment but, because of the quality of production and treatment of the subject matter.  Other than that, the events themselves are positively horrid!  Josef Mengele was a monster of the first water and the things that he and his team of doctors did to the poor wretched creatures in their charge is sickening.  Their behavior in the name of ""science"" was totally repugnant.  I must admit, I only watched a little less than half--I had to turn it off.  Not recommended for the weak of heart, but if you have a strong stomach you will be able to appreciate the work that went into making this documentary about a truly demonic being.",1385856000,,687,4.5528455284552845
3479973,5,B001B2E5IY,"There's not a whole lot more to be said about the life and times of Dr. Josef Mengele, research scientist turned war hero turned concentration camp doctor turned Most Wanted Man Alive. His name is synonymous with Auschwitz and Nazi atrocities, and even Geraldo Rivera had a segment on him that renewed the cry for blood nearly four decades later. Unfortunately for the international convention of Nazi hunters, Mengele had a heart attack and drowned in South America a couple of years before Geraldo ascended the soapbox. David Frost himself became part of the posse once upon a time, and ""The Search for Mengele"" is his informative and entertaining report.

There's nothing new under the sun about the Angel of Death, especially since his family and friends gave up everything once his death was finally discovered years after the fact. He was hardly the protected VIP featured in ""Boys of Brazil"", nor was he the destitute old man depicted by his intimates, though the truth probably lies somewhere in between. Frost is one of our great contemporary journalists, giving this documentary a suspenseful whodunit atmosphere taking it a step beyond the Nazi tattlers glutting the market.

If you've never read the strange tale of Mengele's life and times, or if you're looking for a novel addition for your collection, ""The Search for Mengele"" is a worthwhile purchase.",1378166400,,1367,5.0176211453744495
3479974,3,B001B2E5IY,"This documentary had a good subject matter, but it tended to drag some;  probably should have been shorter.  Still worth watching, though.",1374710400,,138,5.2272727272727275
3479975,5,B001B2E5IY,"Josef Mengele (born Josef Rudolf Mengele, March 16, 1911 - February 7, 1979) ""was a German SS officer and a physician in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. He earned doctorates in anthropology from Munich University and in medicine from Frankfurt University. He initially gained notoriety for being one of the SS physicians who supervised the selection of arriving transports of prisoners, determining who was to be killed and who was to become a forced laborer, but is far more infamous for performing human experiments on camp inmates, including children, for which Mengele was called the ""Angel of Death"". After the Second World War, Mengele maintained his complete innocence, writing `I, personally, have not killed, injured or caused bodily harm to anyone.'""

Of course, we do learn about Mengele's youth, family life, medical education and his ultimate involvement at Auschwitz including his ""experiments"" especially on twins and children all in the name of developing an Aryan/German ""master race."" Nevertheless, the documentary tells Josef Mengele's story with an emphasis on his hiding in South America from Israeli and other authorities as they searched for him to prosecute him and unquestionably sentence him to death for his crimes against humanity. The filmmakers used still photos; interview footage with his son Rolf and people who sheltered Mengele when he was in South American countries; silent archival footage and more to inform the viewer about Mengele and exactly how he escaped out of Europe to South America where he hid in Buenos Aires, Paraguay and So Paulo among other locations. The escape story and route is somewhat complicated but it is all very clearly explained.

The interviews with Holocaust survivors as well as Allied records concerning Nazi Germany indicate that Mengele committed such heinous crimes that he should have been captured and tried for his crimes; but we learn that he wasn't ever captured--and the reasons why he was never captured are explored.

The DVD comes with some brief but informative notes and you can select chapters from the film if you wish to review just a few portions of the movie. True, there could have been more extras; but then again the film is so educational this becomes a minor quibble.

The Search for Mengele is a well done documentary about the life of a man who willfully committed atrocious crimes against humanity only to deny it all forever after the Second World War. I highly recommend this film for people studying World War Two, the history of Nazi Germany and Mengele himself.",1347580800,22,2568,5.121718377088306
3479976,1,B001B2E5IY,"This DVD is very superficial and fails to present an accurate historical record of Dr. Josef Mengle, including a balanced description of his early education and family life, medical-surgical services on the Russian front, and his work at the prison camp.  The book ""Mengle"" is far more detailed, although there is a tendency to make assumptions about things he allegedly did and eyewitnesses that were not really eyewitnesses that are not well-documented, including the extrapolation of numbers frequently cited without much scientific evidence (estimates, worst case scenarios, etc.); this documentary is a low-quality, budget film, with extremely poor picture quality, poorly choregraphed, of no historical value, providing no new information, is superficial and a waste of money.  There is much more detailed, historically balanced and accurate information available but requires effort to sift out, locate and read.  A made-for-TV movie could have presented a fascinating story, with historical accuracy, presenting many aspects of his complex life before, during and after WWII (and also more from his family's perspective and those with whom he lived in Gunzberg and countries where he fled post-war Germany) and the considerable lapses for many years in attempts at 'finding' him.  His life was much more complex and sophisticated, as was his role as a physician and anthropolgist than one would ever guess from this ""documentary.""  Don't waste your money.",1347148800,5,1463,5.513392857142857
3479977,4,B001B2E5IY,"The movie was a great documentary.  At least we find out that Mengele suffered later on in life, which should have ended in his hanging, or worse.  I like to think he was tortured, at least mentally, for all the horrors he inflicted on tens of thousands of people!",1291852800,8,264,4.36734693877551

The contrast of his idea of the Hippocratic oath after the war and what he did during the war is so amazing.  How do you live with yourself after sewing twins together, unnecessary surgery w/o anesthesia, etc.  The cruelty is beyond what most normal people can fathom.  This gives you the mechanics of how he came to be the monster we know; but I don't think we'll ever know what happens to people that make them so evil.  I truly believe that he resides in hell with the rest of his BFFs.",1464480000,,639,4.239669421487603

3479989,4,B001B2E5IY,"This is an interesting and informative documentary, narrated by renowned journalist David Frost, about Dr. Joseph Mengele. Born into a wealthy Bavarian family and well educated with doctorates in Anthropology and in Medicine, the handsome Dr. Mengele would go on to gain notoriety as the doctor in the concentration camps known as the Angel of Death.

The documentary features interviews with a number of people who personally knew him. Their perspectives are certainly interesting and help to built a portrait of this war criminal.  The interview with Mengele's son, Rolf, who looks uncannily like his father,  is unexpectedly moving.

It seems that even though Mengele evaded capture by the authorities for his war crimes, there was no happily ever after for him. Any attempt at a normal life came to nothing, as life with a fugitive would prove too daunting. He lived a life on the run, always fearful of capture.

This documentary features a number of disturbing images from the concentration camps. So, it is not for the squeamish. It also attempts to build an objective portrait of one of the most notorious war criminals of the Nazi regime.",1462752000,,1147,5.015789473684211

3479995,2,B001B2E5IY,I had really bad problems with this movie. I watched it on my Kindle Fire and it got to a point between half and 3/4 through where the movie would only give audio and no video. I tried everything - and I'm a computer guru - but could not shake it loose. I tried multiple times to start it shortly before it would mess up - but the screen always went blank at the same point and would provide audio only. After wasting way too much time I finally gave up. This movie is graphic too - so beware of learning things that you might not want to learn about him.,1459382400,,555,4.009009009009009

This time around however who will be the one's to stand up?

3480065,3,B001B2E5IY,"Too brief but informative.  If one is new to the history of WWII the various documentaries offered on Amazon are a good stepping stone.

Josef Mengele is undoubtedly one of the most vile of Hitler's henchman.  His ""selection"" process was so base that it beggars the imagination.  In addition his cold and calculating experiments on twins and other children was beyond cruel and inhumane.  His reasoning was; if it saved a Luftwaffe pilot or advanced the racial philosophy of the ""true believers"" in Nazism it was well worth it.  It was too bad the Mossad wasn't able to snatch him like they did Adolph Eichman.",1424476800,,610,4.761904761904762

This is an excellent documentary about some of the diabolical.things that this man did during WWII. From a historical view, it offers a lot of information about what he did and why he did it. The fact that he denied what he did till the day he died was despicable. I am always fascinated by history even though some of it is disgusting. I am a firm believer that if you don't know about something, it is possible that it could happen again.",1416355200,,542,4.171428571428572

3480080,4,B001B2E5IY,"Mengele committed horrific acts violating his Hippocratic Oath. There is no doubt about that. It is good to see that he and others of his type are still highlighted as the antithesis of the ideal ""Man of Science.""

But what is particularly encouraging about this film is that it doesn't heap the blame of the atrocities at Auschwitz on Mengele. His fascination with twin research actually originated with Dr. Verschuar's work. It is even possible that Verschuar encouraged Mengele to go to Auschwitz to carry out experiments on twins. Add to that the anti-Semitic propaganda that pervaded German academia during the time and you have a recipe for a twisted pursuit of scientific knowledge.  Such clarifies the depressing fact that evil notions rarely occur in a vacuum. They are inherited and taught. Mengele was a product of his education, station, race, culture. etc. And so, he was made into a man that many today consider evil. What is more is that people falsely think men like him are anomalies. At least, they would like to believe that...",1405123200,2,1046,4.903954802259887

3480085,5,B001B2E5IY,Sad that he never was brought to justice. Maybe all involved should evaluate there own responsibility in that and those not involved should resolve that something like this never happens on their watch.,1396396800,5,202,5.151515151515151

What is it about the human condition that allows you to separate and detach?  Mengele was an expert, obviously.  Married with a son,  I cannot fathom what enabled him to perform atrocities and yet,  not relate to the pain and terror he reigned on others.  It wasn't as if he was criminally insane,  he was adept socially.  Startling.",1393891200,8,491,4.938271604938271
