3796417,2,B001U3ZZ24,"The premise for ""The Telling"" is that a popular sorority, one year after a rejected pledge killed herself, is accepting less popular (read: not blond) pledges. Three prospective pledges must each tell a horror story in order to gain admission to Omega Kappa Kappa. Thus, we are treated to three horror stories, one involving a spooky doll (a premise I don't think is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/entirely/dp/B001B1UO6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">entirely</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B000FFJZO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>), one involving an aging (30!) actress whom the studios no longer want and who is willing to take any role as long as the check clears, and a story of some bored sorority sisters who make a prank call only to overhear what seems to be a murder. There is also the wrap-around story, of course, involving the suicide.

Though the acting is generally competent and there is some inventive camerawork (notably in the second of the three stories), most of the film seems flat. One problem is that the stories, as filmed, are too close to the stories as told, and there is little character development and little effort to transcend the idea of the telling. It certainly is possible to have good and frightening stories in the span of 20 minutes or so, but this film fails for the most part, instead relying on stereotypes, clichs, and predictability.

If you absolutely have to watch this, I recommend skipping ahead to the second story, which, while not fully developed, is at least the most inventive of the three. The last story, though its plot may sound like an updating of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sorry-Wrong-Number/dp/B000063URD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sorry, Wrong Number</a>, is too derivative of far too many recent films and by no means up to the standards of that Barbara Stanwyck classic.",1242172800,5,1993,5.940766550522648

3796433,3,B001U3ZZ24,"The Telling is a horror anthology that consists of a group of girls telling urban legends so they can be in an exclusive sorority of some sort. I was surprised at how good this movie is, but it wasn't amazingly good. The stories are surprisingly entertaining and quite original. The first one is probably the best due to the great acting, while the second one fails to entertain and the third is filled with cheesy suspense taken from an urban legend from the 60's but with a twist. If you're interested in this film to see Holly and Bridget then know that their acting was the worst in this film, especially Holly, which actually gets distracting. But for the most part, the movie isn't bad and deserves a rental.",1342137600,,714,4.542635658914729
3796434,3,B001U3ZZ24,"A horror movie filmed largely at the Playboy Mansion - and starring ""Girls Next Door"" babes Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt?  Obviously, The Telling did not fall in my list of movies to be avoided.  Somewhat to my surprise, though, the film turned out to be a real attempt at making a horror movie and not a flimsy excuse to show hot babes in various states of undress.  In fact, there is no serious nudity to speak of - just some young women in bikinis and other quite flattering outfits.  So, is The Telling scary?  Not in the slightest.  That being said, though, it really isn't all that bad of a movie.  Some of the girls can actually act to some degree.

Due to a most unfortunate event that took place during the previous year's sorority initiation process, whatever school this is has applied ample brakes to the whole hazing process.  It's just as well, as this year's crop of pledges to Omega Kappa Kappa is somewhat inferior.  This sorority, you see, is made up of the most beautiful-and-we-know-it girls on campus, as personified by the sorority president, Stephanie (Holly Madison).  This year's final three wannabes are, sadly, rather plain.  Still, each of them has her shot at becoming a part of the Greek society devoted to ""perfection without exception.""  All they have to do is tell a scary story that will send chills down the luscious spines of Stephanie and her horror-loving sisters.  What follows are stories about a creepy, possessive little doll; an aging B-movie starlet babe who accepts a most unfortunate film role purely for the money; and three teens who hear something they should never have heard while making prank calls one night.  The story of the sorority initiation process itself makes up a fourth story.

There's really nothing all that bad about The Telling - but, unfortunately, there's really isn't anything all that good worth noting, either.  Each of the stories is rather predictable, and a final twist at the end should not come as a surprise to most viewers.  Still, it's better than many a horror anthology film I've seen over the years.  I suppose some Girls Next Door fans can also take comfort in the fact that they can watch this horror film with no fear of witnessing any real blood or gore.  To tell the truth, I'm a little surprised this film actually got an R rating.",1340323200,,2327,4.6987654320987655
3796435,2,B001U3ZZ24,I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.,1324944000,,188,3.395348837209302
3796436,5,B001U3ZZ24,"Holly Madison and Bridget Marqueadt (both from E!'s THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR) star in this decent 2009 horror anthology. It is nowhere near as good as George A. Romero's CREEPSHOW, John Carpenter & Tobe Hooper's BODY BAGS or Roger Corman's TALES OF TERROR. Nicholas Carpenter and an uncredited Jeff Burr (LEATHERFACE: TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE PART III, STEPFATHER 2, PUPPET MASTER 4 & 5, THE DEVIL'S DEN and PUMPKIN HEAD 2: BLOOD WINGS) direct this ""different"" kind of horror anthology. One story tells of an evil doll, the second story tells of an actress who will go to the extent to keep her youth and the third story telling about a group of girls pulling prank calls. My personal favorite part is the opening scene and the revenge at the end. I will keep it short and simple. I like the movie but I don't love it. 5 out of 5 star rating!",1324252800,2,836,4.506578947368421
3796437,3,B001U3ZZ24,"This movie was a poorly made, badly acted cheese-fest...However, it had some redeeming qualities that made it entertaining. It is 4 stories in one. Holly Madison is the evil, vain and shallow leader of a sorority and as part of an initiation she makes 3 ""ugly"" (aka, normal looking girls with no plastic surgery) each girls tell a scary story.

It has a little bit of humor and a lot of camp that reminds me of a lot of classic cheesy B-horror flicks. It has many impossibly hot girls who can hardly act but fortunately there are a lot of nude scenes to keep things interesting if you are into that kind of thing. If you love seeing hot women and cheesy horror you will like the nudity and the cheese. If you are not a fan of seeing hot women, you will enjoy seeing many of them meet their doom in this movie! Either way, if you are looking for cheesy horror this isn't bad. It was better than I expected but that isn't saying much!",1311638400,,932,4.265536723163842
3796438,2,B001U3ZZ24,"Possibly financed by Playboy, ""The Telling"" features a warren of bunnies from Hugh Hefner's personal hutch. As ""actresses"" these dumb bunnies can by rated triple d cup (actually dumb, dumber and dumbest). While none of them would ever be considered for an academy award-they would hands down win the ""booby"" prize.

It's a shame that any effort was expended on this vanity production as it plays, because the basic story had potential if more time was spent on the horror and less time on eye-liner and lip gloss.

A trio of pledges for the most useless sorority on campus, Phi Delta Braindead, are being interviewed/initiated.  As part of their initiation they each must relate a scary story for the approval of the sorority sisters. (The mistress of ceremonies is so amply endowed she has to hold onto the arms of her chair with an iron grip so she doesn't fall forward).

The stories involving a possessed doll, actors famous for portraying ""the undead"" are really ""undead"" and a phone prank gone horribly wrong but here they play out without horror, no scares, no gore, some fake blood in a couple of scenes, no onscreen killings, in other words.....dull.

After the stories are told the ""sisters"" scoff and tell the trio that it was a joke and none of them losers would ever be under consideration for the sorority--but one of the candidates has a nasty surprise in store.

I rated the movie two stars for the eye candy but taking everything into consideration and considering the cast are from a Playboy photo shoot, perhaps my rating should be two carrots.",1280188800,4,1563,4.770370370370371

There is a live and enthusiastic market for most anything associated with the The Girls Next Door. This is rightfully so even as the series winds down and each of the women go their individual ways. The series had a little something for everybody; each of the girls were charming and sexy in their individual ways; Hugh Hefner did a good job in his role in front of the camera and it would appear that he made a number of good decisions behind the camera; the whole Girls Next Door project had a fair degree of excellence as an entertainment vehicle. Just as a last observation on Girls Next Door, I will say that for those who were seeking some mild, light hearted titillation, it had its moments of genuine sexiness, delivered at a level of quality that only Playboy can do.

Anyone agreeing with the above would like to see The Telling succeed, if for no other reason than Holly & Bridget are not only in it but apparently Bridget was involved as a producer. You have the sense from the Behind the Scenses portion that Bridget in particular put a lot of work in this video. I don't doubt that; she routinely comes across as a hard working, sincere and focused lady.

So, what about The Telling. Let me just say that it's nice to see Bridget and Holly again; however, this video is not a top flight vehicle for them, and a number of buyers will be somewhat disappointed. As for sexual titillation, don't worry yourself about that; there essentially is none. Bridget & Holly look good, but you'll see more sex watching Fox News. As for a gripping horror story with professional acting, it's going to be pretty thin for a number of folks. Real GND fans are still going to buy this video, and if anything the end of the show Behind the Scenes 15 to 20 minutes will be the most interesting part. Bridget and Holly are both individually interviewed in this section. Bridget admits that her time as one of Hef's girlfriends as well as her residence in the Playboy mansion are winding down, and that she will be an upcoming moderator to some extent on the Travel Channel. I suspect that this will be a much more successful vehicle for her.",1274572800,,2357,4.476744186046512

The first is about a guy that brings home a scary homicidal doll that forms an infatuation on him. In the next story, Bridget Marguardt plays an over-the-hill actress who encounters a horrible fate when she tells her agent that she will take the last roll on Earth as long as the check clears.

3796446,4,B001U3ZZ24,"Upon reading the synopsis for the movie and watching the snippets featured in GND, I was hopeful--if still somewhat dubious given the cast of pretty women I have never heard of--that this feature would entertain me for the 100 minutes it promised. It has the potential to entertain if you: a) Don't take this seriously. b) Are not a horny male idiot expecting to see all sorts of nekked pseudo-lesbians ""goring"" themselves with sex (there is none) and c) Are not bothered and/or offended by some of the cast members' ""bunny"" affiliation. If that describes you, do read on! This movie was filmed on location at the Playboy Mansion and the Hollywood Castle with a good camera, so you do not have to endure 90+ minutes of crappy homemade video footage that you could have made yourself. The acting is what you would expect from a movie of this caliber. Some of the women really show potential to act in bigger movies (ex: Rebekah Kochan, Jean-Louise O'Sullivan) while some of the others (i.e. Bridget Marquardt and Jessica Lowe) should stick to being cute. The three plots are interesting, and the one featuring Bridget is certainly pretty to look at. There is a good twist at the end. With all said and done, this movie is not amazing, but not terrible, and much better fare than most low budget horror films. I would recommend renting it before shelling out the money if you're still uncertain, but if you're willing to take a chance and have a couple laughs at some one-liners (""she burned my hand... ON PURPOSE!!!"" ""We may be dead but you'll still be a loser!"") then go ahead and buy it. Cheers.",1251331200,12,1596,4.6431095406360425

I wasn't expecting the ending. I don't really understand all the hype about sororities and wanting to join and be like them.

8342804,1,B001U3ZZ24,"The Telling (Nicholas Carpenter and Harry Grigsby, 2009)

There has been a long tradition, especially since Creepshow in 1982, of America attempting to do horror anthologies and failing miserably. The rest of the world has long since passed us by where they are concerned; the idea of America turning out something as good as, say, Rampo Noir is practically unthinkable at this point. The most recent anthology attempt to come past my poor, abused eyeballs is The Telling, which may be the worst horror anthology attempt I've ever seen. The framing story is woefully transparent (it doesn't help that the synopsis to be found on Netflix Instant gives enough of the game away that you'll be looking for it), and the three stories themselves are shockingly unoriginal; I didn't think anything Hollywood could do would shock me these days, but Carpenter and Grigsby were aggressive in being unoriginal herewe have a talking doll story, the tale of an actress who takes a job she regrets, and a slasher short. Seriously, guys, a talking doll story? If Telly Savalas were still alive, they'd have probably asked him to make a cameo in it. Sheesh. Add in the kind of acting that tells you in no uncertain terms that the casting director was after looks and not talent and one of the worst indie-rock soundtracks in history and you end up with this ridiculous mess of a movie, which gets a half star only because I finished watching it and it was not patently offensive. ",1402358400,,1464,4.782608695652174
8342805,2,B001U3ZZ24,"Wow, how many clichs can you squeeze into one movie?  A lot.  Weve got a killer doll, an aging actress desperate to hold onto her youth, a prank call gone wrong, and the old standby, the half sister seeking revenge.  If you have no desire to see anything slightly original, then THE TELLING is for you.

Probably the only noteworthy thing about this movie is that it stars two of Hugh Hefners then-current three girlfriends and stars of the TV show The Girls Next Door, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt.  After having seen the movie, Id have to say that was definitely the only way this movie gained any sort of audience, because no one watched this based on the possibility of a good movie.  Even I only watched it out of morbid curiosity.  That curiosity is satisfied, and I never again need to watch these chicks act.

The story is nothing special.  A year ago, at a pledge party thrown by a sorority Holly Madison (isnt she in her 30s?) belongs to, one of the pledges killed herself after Holly insulted her.  A year later, the dean has told them they have to revert to traditional methods of pledging, so they bring the current three candidates in and instruct them each to tell a scary story.  Whoever impresses them gets in.

The first story is about a killer doll.  It features Rebekah Kochan whom I recognized from EXORCISM: The Possession of Gail Bowers and the equally terrible HALLOWEEN NIGHT, which leads me to believe this woman couldn't star in a good movie if her life depended on it.  The plot is about as simple as it gets and the acting is pathetic.

Second is Crimson Echo in which Marquardt plays Eva DeMarco, an actress getting up there in years who needs a role to keep paying her bills.  She is contacted about starring in her first horror movie, but when she meets the director, she discovers hes part of a secret group of undead horror enthusiasts.  And he wants her to join their ranks.

Again, blah.  The plot is not only boring, but the execution was coma-inducing.  During the entire movie, this was where my attention wandered the most.

Last up was Prank Call in which three girls who live together decide to spend the night making prank calls.  On the second call of the evening, they wind up hearing someone get killed, then they spend the rest of the night paranoid that the killer is coming after them.  This was the only story that offered any amount of tension and suspense as the girls suspected everyone from the cable guy to the cop who shows up at their door of being the killer.  This one might have actually stood a chance if it 1) hadnt been included in this overall piece of crap and 2) had a script and/or actors worthy of the premise, as standard as it was.

The entire movie felt like writer Joe Lessard (more commonly known for his producer credits; this is his only screenplay) just went through a horror anthology from the 80s, one of those cheap ones youd get at the school book fair for $1, 12 chilling stories from beyond the grave! and each story is like 5 pages because they're basically kids horror and they're all lame.

Whatever his expertise, it certainly isn't writing horror.

The movie was directed by Nicholas Carpenter and Harry Grigsby (Grigsby handled the majority of the movie with Carpenter directing the Prank Call segment), and most of it feels like a lot of style over substance, especially during the Crimson Echo story which was sort of in black and white, with Bridgetts red dress in color.  It didn't work for me, but by then Id already pretty much written off any chance of enjoying this movie.

See, this is what happens when you get together people who claim I love horror movies but have done nothing with their lives that gives any indication they know what they're talking about.  Maybe its profiling, but when a handful of Playboy Bunnies, a set production assistant on The Ghost Whisperer and My Name is Earl, an unknown, and a production coordinator for Bridgetts Sexiest Beaches say to me, Hey, weve got this horror movie we made, my first thought isn't going to be, Wow, thats got to be some killer stuff!  My first impression instead is going to be just what it was when I first read about this movie: Oh.  That should be  a train wreck.  I have to see it.

And I was right.  This wasn't a good movie.  And, look, Im not saying that just because you focus your energies on things other than horror that you shouldnt make a horror movie; the horror community is one of the most welcoming communities Ive ever had the pleasure of being a part of.  But theres one very important thing to know about writing horror: whatever your first idea is, it was probably someone elses first idea first, and several thousand other peoples first ideas. The first ideas are almost always clichs, and THE TELLING feels like about 88 minutes of several first ideas jammed into one story.

On the other hand, I have to give them credit for actually DOING it.  Ive met countless people who have great ideas for a novel or a movie, but will never take that first step toward realizing their dream.  At least these people put forth an effort.  Thats got to count for something.  But its still a really bad movie.",1393459200,,5181,4.519871106337272

8342807,2,B001U3ZZ24,"Right from the first 5 minutes of atrocious, low budget acting concerning a woman who apparently overdoses and the blandness and predictability of the screaming ladies upon discovering the body, the acting never stops being unbelievably terrible.

It's about a group of supermodel-like women that hide in a dark room and spook each other out by telling ""scary"" stories.  Actually they spend their time insulting each other over trivial matters.  These are the worst stories that I've ever seen and don't even illustrate horror by any stretch of the imagination.  The first story is about a doll that comes to life and kills a man and his girlfriend (along with the ex-girlfriend who happens to drop by for a temporary visit).  Having the doll actually come to life would be WAY out of this movies budget, so instead we see a doll sitting perfectly still while killing one person at a time.  The only barely creepy part is whenever the doll has its string pulled and says something suspicious and reason for concern.  That's it.  Several puppet films have done considerably better than this weak attempt.

The second story concerns a woman who's forced to watch a movie from the early 1900's with a film crew sitting around a table, and if there's *anything* that's supposed to trigger a frightful reaction I totally missed it.  Nothing at all about this (thankfully) short and uninteresting story does anything of interest.  The best story is last... and by best I of course mean ""best"".  A few teenage girls sit in their bedroom and make a prank call that goes horribly wrong (for both themselves and the man they're pranking) thanks to a killer being on the loose and ready to slash another set of victims.  It's still underwhelming but at least it's bearable, and the only reason I'm giving the movie a 2-star rating instead of a more deserving 1.

I truly dislike this movie.  Any true fan of horror won't swollow this hogwash either.  Don't waste your time.",1351728000,,1962,4.777448071216617
