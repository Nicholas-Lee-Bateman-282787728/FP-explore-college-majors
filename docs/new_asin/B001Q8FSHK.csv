8335155,3,B001Q8FSHK,"Subtitled the Day to Day Existence in Iron-Age Britain the DVD is more of a tour of the fort, Castell Henlly, where the upper class of the Celtic culture lived.  We get to see their roundhouses, the walls, and get an idea of the wealth and power of those who lived on the hill.  We are shown the tools, weapons, and items used by these folks and we are given some ideas about how much time and manpower it took to build the houses and protect the fort.  They give a good job, also, of supporting all the ideas they present, making such the viewer understands it is all based on knowledge gained from digs and artifacts.  For example, they show in the DVD the many ways they milled the grain.  And they give us some suggestions on why the people left the fort around the first century AD.
But we do not get much in the way of daily life - we do not know who they traded with, where did they get their grain, how did they rule the other folks, such as the farmers, hunters, artists.  It is like touring a Cotton Plantation in the South and just showing folks where the slave owners lived and worked without getting into the rest of it - such as the fields, barns, slave cabins, trade networks, pre-Civil War culture, and so on.
I would suggest you watch it but also get some books, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surviving-the-Iron-Age/dp/0563534028/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Surviving the Iron Age</a>&nbsp;to fill in some of the details.",1333756800,,1487,4.766536964980545
