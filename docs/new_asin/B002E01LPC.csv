3915049,1,B002E01LPC,"In a word:awful. The script was horrific. There was no character development to speak of. They never even say some of the character's names. As a movie about the foster care system some parts were portrayed accurately, but other aspects were completely wrong.",1327104000,,259,5.046511627906977
3915050,5,B002E01LPC,"I first saw this movie on Lifetime network and I have been hooked since. In todays trying times, broken families, and peer pressure, it shows us that all most of these kids need is some compassion, love & understanding. Rosie is incredible in the movie and has even taken steps in her private life to help and adopt. I think if more would take that as an example these kids wouldn't have to 'fall through the cracks and age out'. These kids are in America ... and they are America's children.",1296950400,2,492,4.417582417582418

Given that this story is one that is very near and dear to me, I must say that this is a powerful movie and the information that is presented is one that will not be forgotten.",1261612800,,359,4.070422535211268
3915053,5,B002E01LPC,"""America"" is very dramatic film that portrays the life's potential misery. It covers themes of abuse, suicide, violence, anger, depression, neglect and drug abuse.

It's a very moving film. New comer Philip Johnson, who plays the title character must have a bright future. He is amazing. There are scenes where his responses are monosyllabic or he says nothing yet he says everything. He does an excellent job portraying the pain and misery of of troubled youth.

It was also refreshing to see Rosie O'Donnell taking a serious, non-comedic role. She displays her versatility as an actress in this film as a careering counselor who mentors troubled youth in a foster home, including America.

This film is truly moving it will definitely bring tears to sensitive viewers.",1258243200,9,770,5.095238095238095

3915055,5,B002E01LPC,"This inspiring movie delivers a heart-wrenching, intriguing story about the life of a young boy who was abused, and the help he receives from his psychiatrist, played by Rosie O'Donnell. Acting performance is Superb, and the emotional story grabs your attention in the very beginning, as we view the sad life that one young boy lived. With the constant attention and help his psychiatrist gives, the boy finally begins to realize that there is light at the end of the tunnel, as he holds on tight to hope. He winds up burying his horrifying past, as he moves forward to a new beginning. The story makes the viewer realize that there's always hope, and all we have to do is believe. Powerfully moving, riveting, and entertaining from start to finish. Highly recommended!",1421107200,2,769,4.833333333333333

3915059,5,B002E01LPC,"This was an excellent DVD on the life of a kid who was placed in the foster care system; he was a representation of scores of children who face the challenges of being in foster care.  Also, the DVD presentation takes viewers through the internal dilemma he went through after being abused in the foster home he was placed in. This DVD can be an excellent teaching tool for counselors use in helping students to work the same issues America faced. Moreover, the counselors can encourage students to overcome them via the support the character, America, received.",1392595200,,562,4.793814432989691
