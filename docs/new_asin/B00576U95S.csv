4593640,4,B00576U95S,"Korea's Empress/Queen Myeongseong, her story of the Queen during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea is best known in history for standing up against Japan's military and government influence in the East by aligning Korea with Russia but also her tragic story of how she would be assassinated by those she stood up against.

Her story is quite fascinating and you can't help but respect what she was able to accomplish but seeing how things unfolded when she became a Queen and her willingness to open Korea to work with representatives of foreign countries.

But because of the dramatic and tragic elements of her story and the fact that all photos of the Empress were burned and destroyed, needless to say that the Empress has become a sort of mystery.  No known photo exists and needless to say there have been dramatizations of the Queen and because she is such a historic figure, as well as heroic, there have been interest in her.

And in the case of ""The Sword with No Name"", the 2009 film receives a romanticized fictional story about the Empress or Queen written by Seol-Rok ya and directed by Yong-gyun Kim (""The Red Shoes"").  The film would star actress Soo Ae (or spelled Su Ae, ""Athena: Goddess of War"", ""Love Letter"") playing the character of the Empress/Queen Myeong-seong and actor Seung-woo Cho (""Go Go 70's"", ""Love Phobia"", ""Marathon"").

VIDEO:

""The Sword with No Name"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and the picture quality of this film is fantastic.  From the vibrant colors outdoors, to the colorful outfits that the Queen and the guards would wear, the colors of the film is what makes this film so beautiful.

The HD release of this film also showcases the textures and details of the clothing but also skin of the characters.  Needless to say, visually ""The Sword with No Name"" is fantastic, black levels are nice and deep and color, its strong point looks absolutely great on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Sword with No Name"" is presented in Korean with a Dolby TrueHD 2.0 Mix and and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 mix (note: The case says 1.5 but it's mixed around and should be 5.1).  As mentioned before for many Asian films, I am one who will never watch an Asian film with an English dub.  The Korean lossless soundtrack features wonderful acting by both Su Ae and Cho Seung-Woo and their emotions are very important as a viewer, by listening to the English dub track, I know FUNimation Entertainment is great when it comes to English dubs but the English dub soundtrack...I listened to it for a short while and it wasn't for me.

Dialogue is crystal clear and the sword fights and the clanging of steel upon steel sounds good, despite not being a 5.1 mix.  But still, the acting in this film by its two lead talents are just wonderful and listening to someone else trying to bring that emotion to a Western audience, it just doesn't work for me.  So, I'm biased towards the original Korean dialogue.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For over a decade, since the day I discovered the news about the real-life Empress Myeongseong, I have always admired the stories that detail her life as an intellectual but also what she did to protect her country.

From the late 1800's to early 1900's, Japan was a dominating country known for its ruthless military and its goal of dominating Asia as a whole without Western or international influence.  So, when I researched the Queen back then, it was always an interesting and intriguing story based on real-life events of what this woman did her for her country but also her love/hate relationship to her husband the King.

And as there have been many dramatizations on the life of the real queen, ""The Sword with No Name"" would take things a bit in a different direction by making by romanticizing her story but featuring her as a strong, intellectual woman.

I absolutely enjoyed this film! And sure, as it would have been great to have a film adaptation on the real life Empress, but the fact that she is such an intriguing woman, she also has been somewhat of a mystery.  There are records and writings about her, her accomplishments and life as a Queen (which she is often shown in a juxtaposition with Marie Antoinette) but surprisingly, many documents of the Queen's assassination are just making itself known to the public most recently in 2005 (a written account of the Queen's assassination known as the ""Eulmi Incident"" by a Russian civilian working with the Korean government at the time) but to this day, no photo of her exists (it is said that the Japanese destroyed all photos of her after her assassination).

But one can understand how the Queen's tragedy would add fire to the wheels towards anti-Japanese sentiments in Korea and things would get worse between Korea and Japan for many decades more and tensions between the two countries still exist today.

But if anything, while not a non-fiction-based story, ""The Sword with No Name"" still reignites interest of not just Koreans but people all over the world who have just watched the film and are wanting to learn about the real life Empress Myeongseong.  And for me, there is so much going for this story in terms of its storyline, its strong performances by Su Ae and Cho Seung-woo but also its beautiful visuals and even clever swordfighting choreography.  The film looks absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray and I'm quite happy that FUNimation Entertainment decided to bring this film to the U.S.

""The Sword with No Name"" is a film that Asian cinema fans should watch.  I often hear from my Asian cinema friends about how Asia is stuck within this banality of rehashed films and are stuck with creating satisfying film releases but when I watch a film like ""The Sword with No Name"", I can't help but be rather appreciative for this film because it is one heck of an awesome love story but it also is one of those films that will make viewers possibly wanting to know more about the actual person the film is about.

There is so many positive things going for this film and aside from what I just mentioned, the music and cinematography are absolutely enjoyable to watch as well!  The swordfighting  choreography is not too over the top and I felt it was quite stylized but in a cool and effective way.

Overall, if you are looking for a wonderful film from Korea or Asia that is now available on Blu-ray or DVD in the U.S., I highly recommend giving ""The Sword with No Name"" a try!

Definitely recommended!",1323993600,9,7015,4.710655737704918
4593641,3,B00576U95S,"This was a good movie for movie's sake.  It touches on a time period/culture that is rarely given any face time in cinema(I know there are many Korean films out there, but not so many that cover this subject matter).  The scenery, costume, and set design are gorgeous!  And while there IS action in this film, there is much more going on within the personal relationships of the Queen and her Bodyguard.  It almost has sort of a Romeo and Juliet quality to it.

As for the title of this review...the action in this movie is pretty intricate and plays liberally with human physics.  It's a lot of fun to watch when those scenes are up.  However, they don't last very long and are somewhat spread out (which is fine because the movie isn't all about action).  The end of this movie was somewhat anticlimactic for how BA this leading character was supposed to be.  I won't put any spoilers in place about the ending, but the reason I gave this review its particular title is because our hero doesn't actually wield a sword until the last 15 minutes of the film.  Instead, he opts for this very cleaver-shaped broad knife as his weapon of choice.  He uses it well, but I'm not sure how they came up with the title of this film using that as a reference.

Overall, this is an enjoyable watch.  As for my taste, I would have probably rented it instead.  I did not love it enough to watch more than maybe twice a year.",1322697600,,1411,4.376923076923077
4593642,3,B00576U95S,"I think they needed to make this about an hour or two longer to have better character development and draw people in to sympathize with the characters and buy into the story. As it is currently, it's feels really rushed between scenes that seem to happen months (or even years) apart. There isn't much chance for the characters to flesh out there stories or even the background behind this historical drama. The scenery and costumes were great, but the fight sequences were a little over the top and too much like the ""300"" in having very stylized (and obviously computer generated) graphics.",1319414400,10,592,4.813725490196078

4593648,3,B00576U95S,"If your looking for an action adventure martial arts flick, this may disappoint. It's more a forbidden romantic story with some sword scenes in it. The fight scenes appear almost cartoonish, maybe they are all CGI. But it was interesting to see a Korean film of high production value and get a bit of ""historical"" perspective about the relationship with the Japanese and western empires at the time. I did find the story to be disjointed though. Wondering if there is a longer version that filled in the gaps. The acting is good and the dubbing and sub titles are very well done. Beautiful photography throughout is really a joy to watch. This can serve as a very nice chick flick with some sword fight scenes for kicks.",1386374400,,720,4.6328125
4593649,3,B00576U95S,The movie is suppose to be somewhat loosely based on a historical figure in Korea's past.  Too melodramatic for me and somewhat slow.  Not really an action flick.  Don't be fooled by the title.,1381017600,,193,4.617647058823529

4593651,5,B00576U95S,I loved the plot. he way of privacy was cool calm and unruffled. but he had a strong protective character. he seemed to deem it a weakness but a sense of integrity would not allow the innocent to be wronged while he was near.  I really liked it. I must say it could have been a little more true to the times but it was about a character and his ways of thinking in my opinion.  I would recommend it,1370563200,,398,3.9625
4593652,5,B00576U95S,"As a history undergrad specializing in East Asia, one of the most striking stories was the assassination of Queen Min. On a whim I purchased this film while working on my Russo-Japanese project and was not disappointed. This film entwines fact and fiction as expertly as it does romance and violence. By inserting a swordsman ""with no name"" the story gives the audience a 19th century Korean everyman who just happens to be an expert assassin madly in love with a future martyr.

As an American historian who knew the story well before I bought the film, I was in tears and felt Korean by the end. This film's powerful nationalist narrative is as captivating as the actors whom portray each of the films characters. A must watch film that's sure to be a crowd pleaser for men and women alike, but would likely be offensive to a Japanese audience.",1365811200,,846,4.64

4593654,4,B00576U95S,"I really enjoyed The Sword with No Name even though it was a fictionalized account of the last Korean Empress's life. Usually, I tend to be annoyed by that, but I thought it was well done here and beautifully rendered. And the action scenes were great to watch although in some parts the cgi seemed a bit too obvious. But overall, it is beautifully done.",1362787200,,354,4.461538461538462
4593655,3,B00576U95S,"I've been really going nuts buying asian blu-ray films lately. Well Go USA always has cool previews which only has me going out and buying more asian films. I generally like war films, either ancient or current in the asian genre.

But this movie, I saw at the store, and thought that it looked and sounded interesting. It's not a Well Go USA release, but it is a Korean film which I began to embrace since I've bought ""Tai Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" and ""My Way"", so I expected to really enjoy this film.

Well, as a story, which did include fight scenes, didn't really have alot of action as a whole.  And, of the action scenes, for them to say that this film was based on true events, I find it ridiculous to think a village peasant can have the martial arts skills of wielding a sword, and can take on 30 or so trained guardians of the castle, and still win.

But, somehow this film seems for likely to appeal to a female audience because of the dragged out platonic romantic implications between the Queen and her peasant guardian who wishes to protect her even against the will of her other guardians.

To imply that he is a man with no name, is to say that he is a man of just mere significance. He was just a peasant, a nobody, and yet he strives for a higher purpose.

This seemed like a movie I'd probably embrace more if it were just a made-for-TV PBS film.  To see it as a major cinematic production film, would be to praise it too highly. Out of all the asian films I've bought in the past few months, usually I appreciate the films more when I watch them for a second time.  But this film, I don't think I'd watch it again expecting it to be improved in appeal.  It didn't have enough twists and angles to think I might have overlooked something.  I believe I remember everything that happened throughout the film just after one watch. So, that is to say, that there just wasn't much to this story.

I think I'll just give this disc to someone else. Maybe my niece will like it. It's a simple story that any child could probably take to heart.",1361145600,3,2062,4.275064267352185
4593656,3,B00576U95S,"the films good points are the visuals - altho the cgi are a bit shoddy - the good actors - and the storys intensity

however - the storys intensity is a bad point too - for in order to produce that intensity - the film spends huge chunks of time on the fictitious swordsmans obsessive love with the queen of korea Min Ja Yeong - as she is known in the film - even tho there is no historical source for that name - her birth name is a mystery to history - to history she is generally known as Empress MyeongSeong

btw - the man actually fights with a meat cleaver - but his technique is no different than if was a sword - and - how ironic that a film about a queen who strove to modernize koreas military should spend so much screen time on sword fighting

lost amid the yearning closeups and whirlwind fight scenes - were details on this ambitious womans remarkable achievements in modernizing Korea in the late 1800s - instead - the film reduces that to her curiosity about western fashions

yes - i know all the detail would have to be compressed anyway - but not to this extent if they had spent less time on the swordsman and his love - then this film would also have seemed less clich - ""a remarkable swordsmans infatuation with someone in the royal court"" being a commonplace theme in korean movies and tv

before or after seeing the film - look up ""Empress MyeongSeong"" - this movie will pale in comparison",1357516800,,1413,4.277153558052435

4593660,2,B00576U95S,"The history surrounding Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min) in terms of the, then modern & westernized, innovations she encouraged; the political dynamics within the Joseon Dynasty and with Japan, Russia and western nations (including the US) all would make a fascinating epic movie. But, in this case, all we get is a hint of that story as the movie seemed more focused in creating a fictionalized romantic tryst between her and a peasant soldier. The movie seemed low budget by Asian historical drama standards with not very good CGI; bland acting; not believable action scenes that seemed out of place; poor scene editing with blacked out transitions and jump about, disjointed flow; low quality English subtitling.",1344470400,,714,5.217391304347826

The story was beautiful, really heartrendingly beautiful. The stunts and choreography were very exciting. I'm just now discovering Korean kung fu films and am pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoy them more than Chinese kung fu films.

One thing I didn't understand, however, was the implied mystery of the title. You find out Moo Myoung's name almost immediately - how is he the sword with no name?",1339113600,,571,4.826530612244898

But I give the movie 5 stars for all other aspects: writing, acting, directing, music, costuming, cinematography. My favorite ""period piece"" is ""The Sungkyunkwan Scandal"" which is a 20-episode series and, as with The Sword With No Name, has very high production values and gorgeous costuming. ""Sword...."" is first and foremost a love story, one that transcends life itself. The movie is based on a true story of the painful time when Korea was being born.",1517529600,,768,4.870229007633588
