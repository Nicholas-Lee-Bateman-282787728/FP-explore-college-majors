8561012,5,B00B1RB8LQ,"First, you will want to watch the first series ""Last Exile"". It's great and sets the stage for this series Part One and Two. The characters are well developed, a terrific storyline, and great dubbing. I would call it a mix of sci/fi, fantasy, action, aliens, maybe a little fan service, some comedy and drama. I did look for the best deals and am very glad I got this and Part Two!",1410912000,2,381,4.305555555555555
8561013,5,B00B1RB8LQ,very enjoyable anime and for the most part well made.  I think they threw in some of the 3D gaming style a bit too much but over all very enjoyable to watch.,1406851200,,157,3.90625
8561014,1,B00B1RB8LQ,"I'm a huge fan of the original Last Exile, and I was super-excited when I heard about the sequel series. What I got, however, was a steaming pile. The characters are insipid at best and downright annoying at worst. The story is a muddled mess that limps along while making increasingly clumsy attempts to connect with the events of the first series. The ship-to-ship combat has turned into a farcical spamfest that attempts to distract viewers from the lack of underlying substance with an improbable overabundance of tracer rounds.

Murata's cover art is amazing, as usual. I just wish the series itself had been worthy of it.",1395187200,4,627,4.859813084112149
8561015,3,B00B1RB8LQ,"I'm sorry to say but, this isn't last exile people. Do not buy this so called season 2 of Last exile. Its filled with uninteresting characters like the three young naive girls I'm about to describe including a so called midget guy named Teddy if you can beleive.

Pros-(and Their are few)

-Its art style stays pretty close to the original
-The Ship Battles are the main Awesomeness of this anime but even they can't cloud the crap that's in this weak anime
-Animation/cgi is pretty good for this so called second season of Last Exile(and thats it)
-last but not least the cameos of the former characters are few and far between and thats all you'll find interesting in this Season. Dio is throughout the series and adds some interesting parts but thats about it

Cons-and they are many

-The 3 main characters (Milia The princess of Toron) has no back bone,annoying dialogue, and is just down right to young to be taken seriously throughout the entire series. Now For Fam Fam now 16 years of age looks like the smallest 16 year old you've ever seen. Her personality is most annoying and selfish in a bad way all around one of the worst anime Characters of all time. Her childhood friend Gigi isn't annoying but,lacks any independence to go off on her own away for Fam.

-The Villains are mediocre and uninteresting like the good characters.

-The story arcs if you want to call them that are almost non existent and everything just seems one big mosh pit of mediocrity.

-Story- I have no idea what the Japanese creators were thinking or how they managed to get this second chapter out the door let alone market such a blandly put together anime story. When the only appealing thing about it is its ship battles.

I urge anyone thinking of buying this anime to if you have to see it no matter what just Stream it its not worthy of being called last exile beyond the ship battles. the original characters of the former series aren't given their due and the new characters are annoying and quite down right predictable after the first few episodes. The War in this excuse for a sequel is just meaningless and no seems to take the deaths of entire nations let alone people around them seriously enough. Even for an anime. This anime is nowhere near the glory of the original. so don't buy stream.",1391644800,8,2294,4.550970873786408
8561016,3,B00B1RB8LQ,"First off I am only giving this series a three star ratting because it made me appreciate the original even more so. First off, the producers should have done a prequel to the original series, showed the blue world and how cool it was, showed why the Exiles were the way they were and the Last Exile traveling to outer space and establishing the artificial world that the first Last Exile series was set in. The original series was one that really needed more flushing out via a sequel for its back story. They could have show exactly how the blue world got the way it did. Or they could have showed the younger versions of each of the main characters in the first Last exile series. For example: Claus and Lavies father, Alex and Euris's relationship, the original Guild leader before the Maestro took over, etc, so many characters to show back stories to would have made a great prequel series. Anyways, what caused me to first start not liking Fam the silver wing was the atrocious non-Last Exile like opening song. From the music to the video, it was just wrong. All that aside I still stuck through the entire series from start to finish. I was surprised to see that it wasn't a full 26 episode series like the one before. Overall I really didn't like all of the copied story arcs from the original and the tone inconsistencies as well. I was sitting there saying: Oh, I remember when that happened before in the original series. Overall this sequel borrowed too much and copied too much from the original. Thats not how its supposed to be. After almost ten years this new sequel is supposed to offer up something different, not the same thing just with different gimmicks. What this new sequel should have also done was delve into the politics of the war in depth and flushed that part out in depth too. Also the fact that there wasn't a real villain really ticked me off. Wait, now he isn't evil now? From the first series, the Maestro, was a great villain. Although she didn't have very much screen time it was what she was doing through the Guild that made her a great villain. Now THATS a great villain. See, in a great story the villain is not overall liked or felt sympathy for, they are a villain, not a victim. Anyways, all of this aside, if you want to see an anime that is different then go ahead and watch this one. But don't watch it if you think that it will be better than the first Last Exile. It isnt, it just isnt. This one isn't Last Exile, this one is skies of Arcadia with some Last Exile gimmicks thrown into the mix. What I liked about this series is how it made me appreciate how great the first Last Exile was.",1388102400,11,2640,4.389795918367347
