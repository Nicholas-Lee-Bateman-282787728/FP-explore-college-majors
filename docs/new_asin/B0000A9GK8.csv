8185055,1,B0000A9GK8,"To view all that is wrong with ""Destroy All Rational Thought"",simply skip to the interview with the creators. They fumble through weak excuses of why you hate what you just saw. Lack of money, art-school student film work, bad blood between Gysin's old friends, no shows, and late arrivals. Burroughs on the cover, but with a shaky, poorly recorded 3 minute interview being his only contribution to the film. Purchase ""Thee Films"" to experience the true brilliance of Gysin/Burroughs. I was very disappointed in this DVD.",1193097600,,521,5.069767441860465
8185056,5,B0000A9GK8,"This is a record of a Burroughs and brion gysin artshow called here to Go Show held in dublin in 1992. Features Terry Wilson, Hamri, Hakim Bey , Ira Cohen, Burroughs etc. This documentary features antony balch footage not seen before and not in the archives of genisis p orridge or the corrporate burroughs communications. very interesting footage of musicians of joujouka that burroughs loved and a testimonial shot in burroughs garden of the master assassin talking frankly about brion gysin. A must have for all Burroughs/ Gysin/ Joujouka/Jajouka affectinados.",1119571200,2,563,5.266666666666667
