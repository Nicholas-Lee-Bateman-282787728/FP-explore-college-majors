8228628,4,B000XJMF0G,"Back in the olden-days[1968]---right after a Jimi Hendrix concert---I was drafted. I Knew from TV that ""Gomer Pyle,
USMC"" was just a farce about The Marines: he was too o-l-d (Nabors is 85, now; I'm 65).
Well, anyway, during the chaos of ""selective service"", I snuck down to the Recruiting Office and joined The Navy.
The Chief looked at a list and said
""Didn't you get a draft notice?!""
""Nah! (What could they do if they found out it was a 'fraudulant enlistment'? Send me to Viet Nam?)
Well, anyway, when I was in Vietnam, I was on both LSD-26(Landing Ship, Dock); LST-1150(Landing Ship,Tank)...
the Landing Craft(boats): LCVPs; LCPLs; LCUs; LCMs, got us from ship-to-shore, wherever it MAY be... we were.
Maybe I'll see SOMETHING I spent my youth on... before Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison; Kieth Moon; and
59,000 military died... before I switched over to The Air Force and, finally, retired from The Army.
Marines? Nah!

The USS Tortuga (LSD-26)'s sister-ship---LSD-25---was de-commisioned be-
cause , of course, LSD25 is the chemical abreviation for the psychodelic drug,
commonly known as ""acid"" to those that actually used the hypnotic substance...
back-in-the-day. Not that... I... wasn't ""far-out""... I WAS far-out... 9,000 miles a-
way, in Asia
