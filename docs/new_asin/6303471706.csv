661340,5,6303471706,I teach in a grade school and use Peter Pan as an introduction to the theater and the stage.  The children love it.  They want ot know every detain about how it was made. I recently had my copy stolen and want ot replace it.  It's that good.  Thank you Mary Martin.,978825600,6,265,4.038461538461538
661341,4,6303471706,"Mary Martin, the first of three famous actresses to play Peter in this musical, gives a classic performance in television's first ""in color"" made-for-TV special.  Her rendition of ""Neverland"" remains unmatched by any of her successors. Cyril Ritchard is wonderful as the mischievous Captain hook.  You will sing along, laugh and cry as you watch this 1950's Broadway show reassembled for the 1960 video special. Unfortunately, unlike the pristine video and DVD recorded in early 2000 of Cathy Rigby in the same musical (also available at Amazon.com), the 1960 video quality is poor by comparison.

But truly it is one of the greatest underrated Broadway musicals,along with FLOWER DRUM  SONG and ANYONE CAN WHISTLE.I watched the film again last night and it  never fails to bring a tear to my eye. Liza's ballet when she arrives in  Never Land is always a highlight for me because of the lush orchestrations  for it,and I take my hat off to Mary for being so electrifying in the  show.

661483,5,6303471706,"I remember watching this version of Peter Pan when I was 6 years old and never forgot how wonderful it was.  After recently watching the updated version on NBC (though good), I went in search of the Mary Martin version and was fortunate to find this VHS version.  The performance still has all the wonder and magic that I remember.",1419379200,,331,4.5
661484,5,6303471706,"Yes, this color presentation of Mary Martin's ""Peter Pan"" could be better quality...*if* a great master tape existed. It doesn't. So this is the best we can expect.

At times the picture has slight waviness (at the top of the screen), seems blurry, etc. But the colors are vibrant, and audio is in great shape.

You've seen the outrageous pricing of this DVD? Well here's the reason: It is extraordinarily rare, and likely, there are only a few genuine factory-sealed copies in existence.

Why is this?

This set was manufactured in 1999. In 1999, DVD players were less than two years old in the US, and those players were very, very expensive. VHS was still the norm; DVDs were for the elites who could afford players.

Consequently, GoodTimes didn't produce very many of the DVD sets. They did produce a glut of VHS copies, however.

The DVDs that were released by GoodTimes were packaged in CARDBOARD SNAP-CASES (SNAPPER CASES) ONLY. Absolutely NONE were packaged in today's standard plastic clamshell-type DVD cases.

Did you read that last part? There isn't a single authentic Peter Pan with Mary Martin GoodTimes DVD that comes in a plastic case. Not one.

In addition, all GoodTimes releases had a movie-titled security strip across the top, and the strip was underneath the plastic shrink-wrap.

So to spot a genuine, factory-sealed copy, it must be in a cardboard snap-case and it must have a movie-titled security strip across the top, underneath the shrink-wrap. If the security strip is missing, the set is a re-wrapped (used) one. If it's in a plastic case, it's a fake, worth nothing.

All copies in standard plastic cases are counterfeits, including those with inserts. Most of them originated on ebay, and many found their way here. Counterfeits are still sold on Amazon. by unscrupulous third-party sellers. They are illegal, they are worthless, and if your seller sells you one, you should alert Amazon and demand a full refund.

GoodTimes ceased to exist in 2005. This movie was never again legally released.

Only GoodTimes was licensed by NBC to issue this DVD set. Anybody who copies the GoodTimes version, packages it in a plastic case, and sells it as new is engaging in copyright piracy. NBC still owns the copyright to ""Peter Pan with Mary Martin"", and that copyright can be found on the Federal Government's copyright web site. It's not even legal to ship a counterfeit using the US Postal Service. So if you receive a fake, that's one more agency that might want to know.

Be aware that some sellers will find a used copy in a cardboard snap-case, and they have access to a security-strip printer and shrink-wrapping machine. Any ""new"" DVD in these sets should be absolutely free of any trace of human handling (fingerprints, scratches, rubs). Discs should be pristine. Compare the playing side of the disc to a known, ""store bought"" (but legitimate) DVD. If the Peter Pan version is bluish/purplish, it's a fake. If the DVD disc-label is paper, it's a fake. No exceptions.

I can't stress this enough: Legitimate, authentic new copies are rarer than nearly any other DVD released in the United States. There may be only a handful of them left, and usually, those sets are in the hands of collectors, not sellers.",1418601600,12,3241,4.869090909090909

I would like to see if what I remember from childhood lives up to my memory of that version.  So, I gave this a non-rating (not high, not low) because it's been almost a year since I made the purchase and I still haven't been able to view it. Please note -- The Mary Martin version is not available -- not anywhere -- in the DVD format.

BTW, the Cathy Rigby version is FABULOUS!!!  So if you don't need/want to walk down memory lane, do purchase the Cathy Rigby version.  It's dreamy and awesome.",1400198400,,612,4.428571428571429

661587,1,6303471706,The merchandise was not good. The case was cracked up. the video had not been rewound. I was unable to get it out of my VCR. I had to take the machine apart to release the tape. Had to throw the VCR in the trash after that. It worked up until I put that tape in there. The seller did send my refund back ASAP when I returned it.

661591,5,6303471706,"There is no question that this production of Peter Pan ranks among the timeless classics and should be preserved for posterity.  Other reviewers have already mentioned the stellar performances by Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard and the delightful musical score. This wonderful production has both historical and artistic value and anyone who has viewed it knows of its magic for young and old alike.  The only thing I would add to this discussion is a question:  why hasn't it already been digitally remastered and reissued on dvd?  I'm sure there are many others, like myself, who would snatch it up quickly to replace our worn-from-use VHS editions.  If we all clap our hands enough, perhaps we can bring it back to life as we have already done for Tinkerbell many times in our re-viewing of this classic over the years.",1390176000,,821,4.835714285714285
661592,5,6303471706,"I understand that when Peter Pan was first performed on stage, a female played the title role. This was because of rules regarding child actors at that earlier time in history. I first saw Mary Martin on television in a production of Peter Pan, in a broadcast in the 1950s. I did not like it then. And I do not like it now. I do not think that females in movies for children should play parts that are supposed to be male role models unless, for course, it is for comedic effect. Yuck. Is there anything good that I can say about this product? YESSSSS! For parents interested in confusing their male child as to his gender identity, and interested in traumatizing the child, this movie will be a useful and integral component of any gender-confusion program. For a workable program of gender confusion, I suggest forcing the young boy to wear frilled skirts, pink-colored buckle sandals, salmon-colored lipstick with a tad of eyeliner, and forcing the boy to use expressions more often used by girls, such as, ""My pup is totally my best friend,"" or ""I am so stoked that Bella and Zendaya are reunited,"" or ""Ryan and I took a selfie, OMG!""  Mary Martin's Peter Pan can be an integral and effective part of any parent's agenda of gender confusion.  It is possible that this DVD can be used to confuse girls, as well as boys.",1390003200,,1322,4.550420168067227

And here it is available for purchase on DVD for a very high price.

Well...first of all, you can purchase this on a DVD either in B&W (the 1955 version) or the 1960 version from Media Outlet Dot Com for a lot less money. I have ordered the B&W version for about a ten spot and the color version is available for a few singles more. It hasn't arrived yet so I can't completely vouch for them...but they seem legit. --> Update 1-10-13 Media Outlet sent the wrong dvd and when I sent them a request for the correct one...they told me I was abusive (I wasn't in the slightest..the strongest word I used was disappointed) and barred me from their website!!  A search of the BBB found that they are rated 'F'. Not only would I never purchase from them...apparently I can not anyway, lol!

And secondly, you can, at this date at least (Late Dec 2012), watch the entire 1960 production for free on You Tube! I found it with a search for Peter Pan Musical 1960.

That was one of my first great (but always community-amateur level theatrical experiences, and even with the downside (again, flight, which they never really taught us--we just had to ""know""), something I wouldn't trade for anything.  Opening night, standing behind the curtain w/Wendy, listening to the overture, preparing for takeoff for Neverland--priceless.

Finally, in 1989, the show came back to the airwaves, and I caught it, in between rehearsals for ""Our Town"".  The magic was still there!  As a ""grownup"" at 23, I saw a little more of the sadness behind the highflying spirits (i.e. the ending), also the technical rawness.  But seeing the flying wires, and a few dorky sets was a low price to pay to see Mary Martin, Cyril Ritchard, et. al. showing what made Broadway Broadway, back in the day.

WHY can't a new edition of this particular production be issued?!?  Surely the picture could be easily cleaned up (where it needs it--the darker colors, as I remember, were a little muddy), and they could also add as extras, a delightful 1989 interview between Ms. Martin & Gene Shalit from--the Today Show (?), and some side by side highlights from the 1955-6 kinescope (if that still exists)?

I saw the 1955, 1956, and 1960 telecasts when they were originally aired. I was a kid then. It made me a life-long Peter Pan and Mary Martin fan--and later a fan of Larry Hagman, her son, who co-starred in ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and played the character J.R. Ewing in the old TV series ""Dallas"". In the 1955 telecast, and maybe the 1956 telecast as well, Mary Martin's daughter, Heller Halliday, played the part of Liza, a role written especially for Heller, who was 12 years old in 1955.

I have only seen clips of the 1960 color version since it originally aired on NBC ""in living color"", but I enjoyed those scenes just as much today as I did when I watched the telecast in 1960.

661838,5,6303471706,"When I was 5 years old, my mother took me to Broadway to see Mary Martin in Peter Pan.  We even had box seats.  From that day on Mary Martin was my idol.  I was delighted when she redid the show for tv with Cyril Richard.  I own the VHS tape and would love to have a dvd of it, but with the prices being charged by scalping third party sellers on Amazon, it is cheaper to buy the vhs to dvd conversion equipment and software that are now being sold by Roxio and Nero (Ulead).  I never liked the Disney cartoon of this story and have hated any attempt at redoing it on stage (or tv) since Mary Martin.  Maybe I instinctively felt, even at a young age, that it was great that a woman was playing a boy's part - and ""boy"" could she play it.  There is actually great pathos when everyone leaves him, and I remember when I was young clapping as hard as I could to keep tinkerbell alive.  Disney has co-opted tinkerbell (you should see all the Disney products with her on it), but has done little to promote Peter himself.  Years later, I showed it to my 2 year old god-daughter and she loved it, but I think she has forgotten it by now (with Justin Bieber, etc. taking over her musical tastes).  However, I have noticed that the movies and books I shared with her as a young child remain in some way in her subconscious, and I hope that she will pass them on to her children.  The schools are now teach terribly politically correct stories and seem to have forgotten that part of their job is to keep our own culture going.  I don't mind new additions, but not at the expense of the old standards.  However, beware, the age of the classics we enjoyed as children is now much younger for today's children.  Even Elmo (who is 3 and meant for 3 year olds) is now relegated to 2 year olds.

Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard give admirable performances as, respectively, Peter Pan and Captain Hook in this film of the famous stage show.  Though this adaptation does show its cracks fifty years in, it still holds its own as nostalgic entertainment.

There are two songs in particular I remember from seeing this rerun on television during the 1980's.  These are ""I'm Flying,"" which is, predictably, the song played during Peter's initial flight to Neverland with Wendy, Michael and John and ""Captain Hook,"" sung by Hook and his pirate gang to extol the Captain's status as the leader of the pirates.  Amazingly, I can still plainly remember the laughable line from this song ""...Mrs. Hook's little baby boy...""  I suppose the creative team was trying to get a laugh out of young children who might otherwise have been scared by the villain.  This is, actually, a more durable song overall than the repetitive and obvious ""I'm Flying.""

There are limitations to the set work in this production.  Adapted from a play, the sets often look only vaguely better than the quality of sets one would expect to find in a high school production.  Additionally, the politics and norms of 1960 are very much in evidence, as the Native American girl Tiger Lily is played by a lily-white blonde actress.  Lastly, even though Mary Martin gives a bravura performance, I have always associated Peter Pan as being played by a male actor.  While Ms. Martin is nominally playing a male character, I cannot make the mental leap to say that she IS A MALE, and as an actor that is what she is trying to sell the audience on in this role.  I don't want to get too deep into gender politics, but J.M. Barrie did create a male title character.  Although he didn't actually appear live onscreen, Bobby Driscoll's vocal work in Disney's animated variation on ""Peter Pan"" also serves as an indelible reminder that the character is, in fact, male.

While this production will always be an item of nostalgia for baby boomers and even to a much smaller degree their offspring, I predict it will lose more appeal than it will gain as time goes on and even newer generations are born.",1265760000,,2172,4.754666666666667

It's a charming keepsake replication of Broadway's production, adapted for TV.. with the actors aged 5 years! Less than 1/2 the cast are originals from the Broadway run and there is a different director. The taping was rushed, because of an impending tech-strike. Mary broke her arm during a flying sequence, so many less-than-perfect first takes had to be used.
None of my above minor ""complaints"" are really important. The production is a piece of Americana.

661909,5,6303471706,"""Peter Pan"" is one of the most beloved stories of all time.  Written by James M. Barrie in the early 1900s, it was originally conceived and concocted for the entertainment of his young stepchildren.  Eventually Mr. Barrie ... a prolific British writer ... would develop it into a sucessful stage play.

""Peter Pan"" ... as everyone knows ... is the story of ""The boy who wouldn't grow up.""  Peter lives in Never Land ... a far away fantasy island ... where companions (the lost boys), pirates, and indians serve to provide every day with exciting adventures.  Peter has the ability to fly ... thanks to fairy dust ... and he likes to travel to London, England ... to the home of the Darling family ... where, hidden from view, he observes their daily lives.  Peter longs to have three things the Darlings have, but he does not: stories, pockets, and a mother.  On one of these visits, Peter loses his shadow inside the Darling home, and so he is compelled to return a week later.  Then, while retrieving his shadow, he is discovered by the three Darling children (Wendy, John, and Michael) who are enthralled by this young visitor.  Peter teaches them how to fly and then leads the group ... which includes Tinkerbell ... a tiny fairy who is Peter's jealous companion ... on a flight to Never Land, where they all enjoy (and are emperiled by) many adventures.  In time, the Darling children become homesick and, to Peter's great sadness, they decide they want to return to London ... and to the loving embrace of their heartsick parents. (Peter does visit the Darling home again ... but much later on)

""Peter Pan"" has a lot of what might be called ""timeless"" or ""universal"" story ideas, which would explain its continued appeal all these years.  This particular production was adapted from a successful Broadway play ... using the same principle performers ... for an NBC television broadcast.  First aired in 1955, it proved to be so popular that NBC re-staged, re-filmed, and re-aired it in 1956 and 1960.  This film is from the 1960 effort.

Unlike earlier ""Peter Pan"" productions, this version was made to be a musical.  The songs ... with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh and music by Mark Charlap ... are delightful and memorable ... and all are sung live.  The dances ... choreographed by Jerome Robbins ... are original and imaginative ... and fun.

The emphasis in this production ... I think it is worth noting ... is on satisfying the audience.  This may seem to be a basic precept in show business, but often shows allow themselves to be taken away from it.  Here everything is done 100% with the enjoyment of the audience in mind.

Mary Martin stars as Peter, and she ""lights up"" like no other performer can.  A great singer and stage presence, she is never-the-less unselfish when it comes to sharing the spotlight with her fellow performers.  Cyril Ritchard plays Mr. Darling and Captain Hook and ... with all due respect to Mary Martin ... he is the most fun to watch here, and his performance retains its appeal the longest (after repeated viewings).  Maureen Bailey is Wendy, and she is a good solid Wendy who gives us a few adorable moments.  Sonra Lee plays Tiger Lily and she is adorable and lots of fun.

But I think this is the best version of all the ""Peter Pan"" shows that have made it onto film.  It is an uncomplicated screen play that is rich in originality, creativeness, and charm.  It is a delight for children ... and those of us who wish that we didn't have to grow up (... cause growin' up is awfuller ... than all the awful things that ever were).",1253836800,,3573,4.601895734597156

The cheap sets, shoddy special effects, and over-the-top acting didn't matter when I was seven, and they don't matter now. The production is still fun to watch, with its classic songs and Mary Martin's legendary performance.

However, it's been several years since this movie's been in print in any format. I'm fortunate enough to own a bootleg DVD copied from a VHS tape, but whoever owns the rights to the video and DVD releases of Peter Pan needs to bring it back into print, digitally restored and remastered for optimal video and audio quality, with a few nice bonus materials. Not everyone knows someone who can get them a bootleg, nor does everyone have $100+ for a used copy, or the equiupment and knowledge required to make their own homemade DVD from their video copies. This classic NEEDS to be available to the masses. Maybe even in a 2-Disc set with the kinescope version of the 1957 broadcast on disc 2, making this a true Special Edition.

661994,5,6303471706,"Musical comedy star Mary Martin may have not been as well-known to many of us if she hadn't appeared in a television version of the famous ""Peter Pan"" story on March 7, 1955.  After achieving great success on Broadway, and limited success in Hollywood (in generally disappointing film roles), Martin joined Australian actor Cyril Ritchard in an outstanding adaptation of Sir James Barrie's classic tale of boys who would not grow up.

All of the elements of the story were incorporated in the NBC compatible color telecast, including the use of a woman in playing Peter Pan.  Mary Martin was slender and cut her hair short; with the use of make-up, she was able to achieve the effect of portraying an adolescent boy who refuses to grow up.  Peter lives on an uncharted island with other boys who don't want to become adults.

One of the amazing things about Peter, however, is that he has the ability to fly.  (The effect was done through the use of special wires.)  During one of his nighttime flights, he spies on a family in London and, eventually, persuades the children to come to his island.  This includes the daughter, Wendy, who becomes a virtual mother to the boys.  Soon, however, they are battling pirates and Indians.  Peter Pan has considerable imagination in dealing with the threats, but there are numerous dangers, particularly from the pirates led by the notorious Captain Hook (wonderfully portrayed by Cyril Ritchard, who also plays the father of the English children).

Interwoven into this delightful adaptation are some memorable songs that became extremely popular.  The original live telecast was so popular that NBC telecast it again in compatible color on January 9, 1956.  Unfortunately, videotape was still being perfected and neither telecasts were taped.  Eventually, as videotape became more practical, NBC was able to reunite Martin and Ritchard for a color taping of the musical in 1960.

Typical of early color telecasts, the color range is more limited than today's color, but it is still quite impressive and one can enjoy the fine performances by Martin and Ritchard and the top-notch supporting cast.  Yes, the sets are somewhat limited compared to today's television productions, but that is not a big factor in enjoying this production.

It is wonderful that NBC was able to preserve one of the more enjoyable television productions from the ""golden age"" of early television.  This is a story, too, that can appeal to both children and adults and is a reminder of a more innocent time when spectacular effects, sex, and violence were not as important (or even allowed).",1146096000,8,2610,4.974654377880184
661995,5,6303471706,"This is probably the best live version available for young children. What I like best about this particular version is that it emphasizes the idea of children at play; Tiger Lily and her indians are clearly children playing, not real Native Americans. Even the pirates have a sense of children playing (they fight over Michael's bear, for example). The music is excellent. My boys just love it!",1145664000,10,394,4.895522388059701
661996,5,6303471706,"I'd just like to comment that Peter Pan was traditionally played by a woman and this musical role calls for a woman to sing the songs. When I was in sixth grade, the high school performed this and cast a guy in the part of Peter and he was just awful--especially in the Mysterious Lady song. He was so out of key on all of the songs. I just wanted to kill him!

You are entitled to your opinion of course, but I don't think you should say you hate this movie or it is stupid just because the part of Peter Pan is played by a female.

I've loved this musical since I was 9 years old and Mary Martin IS Peter Pan. I also enjoyed Cathy Rigby's performance but it was less magical for me.

I hope they put this back on put this back on dvd soon and remaster it. Is the sound and picture quality really that bad?",1143590400,6,807,3.9691358024691357

Now, i wasn't born yet when it was first transmitted, but that hardly takes away from not being able to fully appreciate and feel entertained. My kids LOVE both versions, but really get a kick out of this one. They just love the songs. It's disillusioning to me to read other ""kids'"" reviews who just didn't get it.

662104,5,6303471706,"The Mary Martin version of Peter Pan will always be my link to the past when it comes to musical theatre. I grew up watching these characters, dancing along to the Indian dance, and memorizing nearly every line.

Mary Martin's portreyal of Peter lacks the aura the author wrote into his first stage play ""Peter Pan"" (later adapted by him into the book ""Peter and Wendy""), which was a reckless, and forever young child. However, Martin's acting prowess soon helps us ignore that fact.

It should be noted that though it was taped live for NBC, there is no audience present. There are also several differences from the recently broadcast A&E version. Martin's version contains the hillarious ""Mysterious Lady"" sequence, while Cathy Rigby's production treats the rescue of Tiger Lily as it happened on Marooner's Rock (as written in the book).

These two versions (assuming you have seen them both) are different enough to not be compared directly. Each of them have their own pros and cons,and both are very enjoyable.

This DVD is a must own for all who, like I did, grew up watching Mary Martin fly around the stage in the colorful world of NBC's timeless broadcast of ""Peter Pan.""",1099440000,39,1181,4.802955665024631

This is the way to enjoy a musical.  With this one sees a historical event before their eyes.  Mary Mrtin is one of the greatest to ever adorne broadway.  Seeing her perform is breathtaking.

662106,5,6303471706,"My mother-in-law bought me this movie in VHS format for father's dad a few years ago. Little did she know what a wonderful gift it was! It meant a tremendous amount for this older dad to cuddle up on the couch and watch PP with his wife and two young boys. The kids didn't understand why I held them so tightly or why I broke out into tears so many times (especially from hearing Never Grow Up and Neverland), perhaps from recollections of watching the original broadcast in B&W with my parents, or hoping that we will not grow any older and our kids will remain young forever, or perhaps because our world has been changed so dramatically?
Peter Pan also instilled a dream in me as a child: a dream to ""fly."" Thanks to NASA, I had my dream granted and was able to ""fly"" on their famous ""vomit comet"" zero-gravity jet. Thus, I became one of Peter's children for a day in my life. My boys are very proud that their dad go to fly like Peter and the kids.
God bless everyone involved in making this version of Peter Pan available to us in both VHS and now DVD format, and thanks to Amazon.com for giving us this forum to express ourselves.

662108,4,6303471706,"This edition of the famous Mary Martin ""Peter Pan"" is not the very first 1955 telecast. That telecast is preserved on kinescope, not videotape, and most likely exists only in black and white, as kinescopes were unable to reproduce color.

 Instead, this is the 1960 production of that same musical, here preserved in color, and those who are expecting a ""different"" production need not worry. Most of the original Broadway cast is still here--the exceptions are the children, who naturally have been cast to replace the 1955 kids who of course had outgrown their roles. Wendy and Jane in this production are played by Maureen Bailey, who, although having an attractive singing voice, is a shrill actress who quickly gets on one's nerves (unlike Kathleen Nolan, who went on to have a successful career on television after ""Peter Pan""). Liza the maid is played not by Mary Martin's daughter Heller Halliday, but by Jacqueline Mayro.

But practically everything else is the same as the 1955 production, and those who think that they have grown up watching that 1955 production are mistaken; it is this 1960 production which has been rerun over and over on television and issued on video. Yes, the sets look cheesy in comparison to what we would see today, and you can see the wires when the actors fly, but you will most likely never see a better, more heartfelt production of ""Peter Pan"" than this version. It is the only one which truly captures the spirit, humor and poignancy of the story, unlike the chintzy, superficial Cathy Rigby production. Mary Martin as Peter, Cyril Ritchard as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook, and Joe E. Marks as Smee have never been bettered by any other actors playing these roles.",1011657600,154,1707,4.839041095890411
662109,4,6303471706,"What 'Peter Pan' is, more than anything else, is a time capsule of a long-gone era of vintage television. If parts of the Mary Martin production look a bit outdated, that's because this DVD is a re-mastering of a 40+ year-old videotape, and color videotape was fairly new in 1960 (it was only in its 3rd year, following pioneering specials with both Dinah Shore and Fred Astaire). The other reason for its static look is that the production was recorded *live,* without stopping for better or additional takes; what they saw in 1960 is what you got. This is the same way it was presented in 1955 and 1956 when it was a one-time live broadcast. And while the DVD includes the NBC title cards, it does not, sadly, include the logo of the animated NBC peacock. I understand the 1956 production is recorded on kinescope, but more than likely you have to view that one through the MT&R headquarters in New York. Nevertheless, it's a lot of fun!!",1006473600,7,940,4.568047337278107

662111,4,6303471706,"""I Won't Grow Up""
Ah to be a kid again. It was as a kid when I first saw this Broadway on Television Musical production of the timeless tale of the flying boy who refuses to grow up. Although I am a few years too young to have seen the original Live broadcast, I saw a later rebroadcast that left me with vague memories of a 40 something Mary Martin as Peter Pan, a huge furry (actor in a costume) sheep dog, pirates, indians and pieces of the tunes of ""I won't grow up"", and ""Ugga Wugga"" floating pleasently through my head. It was rebroadcast for a more recent ""For the first time in 20 (or 30) years"" anniversary just before being relased onto VHS for the first time.
I don't feel there is much need to go into the story for this one since most viewers would be at least familiar with the Di$ney animated version of this magical story. So I'll mention some of the cast: Peter Pan (Mary Martin), Captain Hook (Cyril Ritchard) the musically inclined leader of the Pirates, Wendy (Maureen Bailey), Tiger Lilly (Sondra Lee) the Indian cheif. A coulple of neat keeper features are the original NBC Credits voice-over and the (back from the commercial breaks) Act slides.
This DVD is Fantastic, there is only some slightly noticible video glitching (in the final scene)which is very good coming from GoodTimes Home Video. Most of my budget VHS tapes from them are on the cheesey ""spit & bubble gum"" side of quality. Considering it was mastered from the original Live broadcast, the video quality is incredible for a 40 year old television production. The audio track could use a little tweaking to get rid of the slight tin can sound, but is remarkably very good. The ""Clam Shell"" case (Yuck!) says it's in stereo... obviously it's remastered Mono to Stereo Stereo, since ""Stereo"" television didn't appear until sometime in the mid-eightys.. They also have a ""this film has been modified to fit your television screen"" message at the begining, WHY? It is from a Television Broadcast there should have been no reformating, oh well.
The extras are very few:
English and Spanish Captioned Subtitles 18 Still Photo Scene Index (numbered with hooks)
and that's about it, Production Notes or Cast Bios might have been an interesting thing to add. I'm not sure if in 1960 they had ""Teaser"" promos for special shows or not, perhaps not for live events. Since the case is clam shelled there is no book with extra production notes or something thrilling like that.
I give Peter Pan a 4 for picture and a 3 for sound.",993513600,9,2503,4.614349775784754
