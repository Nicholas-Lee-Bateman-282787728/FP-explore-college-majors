8052686,3,B0007WFY0W,invaders from mars is a classic about a boy who watches his loving parents get brain controlled by martians as they seek to take over the world by controlling key people. Its different in that its told from the view of a small boy and the ending is classic.the disc also contains the British version of the film which to me was not as good as the loving parents idea was left out. Flight to mars is an average Sci-fy movie about landing on mars and meeting a civilization that appears friendly but in reality wants to steal their damaged space ship. It is probably worth the $14.99 originally but not the great sums dealers are now charging for this out of print collection. I bought it hoping to get a better copy of invaders from mars but its the same worn print from the 50th anniversary edition with lines going through it. Flight to mars had one rough patch where it was pieced together where the tape broke and the conversation jumps,1490659200,,939,4.433526011560693

8052688,4,B0007WFY0W,"This 3-pack contains two classics- FLIGHT TO MARS and INVADERS FROM MARS, and one abysmal failure- ATTACK FROM MARS. FLIGHT TO MARS has Arthur Franz and Cameron Mitchell in a fanciful tale of post WW2 space exploration. It also has the stunning uber-babe, Marguerite Chapman as a beautiful Martian lass! She -and her amazing, 10' long legs- hold the greatest appeal for me! INVADERS FROM MARS is the Martian invasion masterpiece starring Leif Erickson and Arthur Franz. The story of a boy who sees an alien ship land in his back yard, only to have no one believe him, is paranoid perfection! His parents winding up as alien zombies adds even more to this fairly dark story. As for ATTACK FROM MARS, this is someone's idea of a bad joke. A ship lands outside of a movie theater. The characters inside the theater are so annoying, so absolutely stupid, that watching this poorly-written mess is like drinking toilet-bowl cleaner! Watching it once may cause your foot to fly through your TV screen!...",1372982400,6,998,4.808139534883721
8052689,2,B0007WFY0W,"There are really three items which makes a review difficult.

The G*O*O*D: ""Invaders from Mars"" is a classic from the 50s. It has all the elements for a fun time (if you ignore a cheesy Martian with rubber suited cohorts), plus it can be fruitful for discussions on paranoia, childhood fears and the ever-present commie in disguise so prevalent in my childhood.

'B' GOOD: ""Flight"" to Mars is enjoyable for those of us who love the genre, OK but will never be listed in any list of classics.

G--A--R--B--A--G--E !!!!!!!!!!! ""Attack from Mars"" is a horrible, crass parody of a 1956 Saturday afternoon at the movies as seen by thirty something's who smoked too many blunts and actors who should be ashamed of themselves and go back to their day jobs or go on the public dole. Envision the breasts of a 60 Quintuple-E being fondled by supposed teens while she writhes in ecstasy as her date ignores the scene. Now realize that this is as good as it gets and that the movie degenerates from here. Let us launch an attack on Attack and destroy all vestiges of this flick from off the earth!",1252713600,15,1086,4.558974358974359
