2057358,5,B00023BKNQ,"""A Fine Romance"" brings together the witty writing of Bob Larbey with the engaging comic delivery of Michael Williams and Judi Dench. The unfathomable attraction of this unlikely and very awkward couple is conveyed convincingly through the physical comedy, the sharp and seamless delivery of lines and a brilliant sense of timing. We roll in our seats as they throw buckets of water at each other, cower before the dentist and deliver a brilliant dinner party which neither could attend! As viewers we long for them to get it right at the same time as we revel in all they do hilariously wrong. While this sitcom was created in the early '80s it continues to capture and represent the struggles that all couples face as they embark on a relationship, taken of course to the comic extreme! Dench and Williams breath new life into the sitcom genre, both coming from strong theatrical backgrounds, their sense of dramatic engagement is at times unexpected but always incredibly fun.",1168214400,23,979,4.903614457831325
2057359,4,B00023BKNQ,"God entertainment, reasonable quality of recording,acceptable price. An opportunity to see an early Judi Dench.",1162598400,2,111,6.466666666666667
2057360,4,B00023BKNQ,"I waited a long time before I decided to buy this series(ok about half a year)and then I read a review from somewhere that said ""Hurry up and buy this series before they stop selling it, because it is an older comedy"". I took heed to this possible over reaction and bought the series. When I started watching ""A Fine Romance"" I honestly thought to myself had I made a mistake in purchasing it(sorry) because it did seem kind of lame. BUT then Judi Dench saved it by her magnetism. Judi is the kind of actress who can take a project and make it her own, like this one. After a couple more episodes I actually started to really enjoy this series. Judi's real life husband who plays her on and off again love interest (Michael Williams) is just as much fun to watch as Judi. So to anyone who buys this series, I just want to say give it a run through before making any quick assumptions. My total view changed after I fisnished the series and I now enjoy it. Watching Judi and Michael together is really nice.",1162425600,12,1006,4.3
2057361,5,B00023BKNQ,"Judi Dench and Michael Williams are brilliant with Bob Larbey's writing in this situation comedy. If you like romance that doesn't come easy, this is for you. Bob and Laura are two awkward, unmarried middle agers who stumble into and out of and back into a relationship with each other. I loved being able to watch the entire series from beginning to end.",1152835200,5,355,4.650793650793651
2057362,5,B00023BKNQ,She really brings a character to life.  And this short series of British comedy was really enjoyable.,1141257600,10,101,4.9411764705882355
2057363,2,B00023BKNQ,"I purchased this and was not happy.  This show was most certainly influential for the better and latter show, but by no means has the depth and excellent dialogue of ""As Time Goes By"".",1129852800,10,184,4.411764705882353
2057364,5,B00023BKNQ,"Judi Dench is so great at this type of comedy.

I would have loved to have seen her in something of Neil Simons.

Her gift for repartee is impressive. As a long time watcher of

""As Time goes By"" I was delighted to find this series.

Rather bittersweet that it was made with her husband, who she lost after a long and I gather successful marriage.",1127433600,16,347,4.212121212121212
2057365,5,B00023BKNQ,"Then you MUST buy this complete series.  It is different, but wonderful.  Dame Judi and Bob Larbey (the author of both this and ""As Time Goes By"") shine.  Judi Dench plays opposite her now deceased husband, Michael Williams, and they are a real treat.  Playing a middle-aged couple who miss as often as they click, they show, through real acting skills, what this crazy thing called love is.

I bought this, not having heard a word, or seen a bit.  Because I so enjoyed ""As Time Goes By"".  I sat down with my mom and we laughed and cried and just loved it.

DO NOT hestitate-for this cannot be available much longer-it is over 20 years old.  Just go for it...you won't be sorry.",1125014400,46,678,4.403225806451613
2057366,5,B00023BKNQ,"Those who are familiar with As Time Goes By will already be familiar with the writing of Bob Larbey, who also wrote A Fine Romance, and those who've enjoyed As Time Goes By will almost certainly enjoy 1980's A Fine Romance. Though not so well known, this light romantic comedy about two mismatched 40-something lonely hearts bears all the hallmarks of Larbey's classic and engaging style of writing.

Briefly, Dame Judi Dench (As Time Goes By's Jean Pargetter) stars as Laura Dalton, a highly competent albeit somewhat shy, nervous and highly-strung translator with a tall, pretty, charming and very happily married younger sister named Helen, who only wants to see Laura as happy as she is. Helen and her husband Phil decide to team Laura up with Phil's friend Mike Selway, but it's a match made more out of desperation than a belief that the pair would be suitable companions. Mike (the late Michael Williams, Dame Judi's real-life husband of 30 years who died of cancer in 2001), is a shy, laid-back but very nervous, unkempt, disorganised, and socially-inept landscape gardener. He also has very little in common with Laura with respect to their likes and dislikes. The humour in the series is gentle, and it gets its ""spark"" from the tension engendered by the pairing of this seemingly unlikely couple.

The set contains the all twenty-six 25-minute episodes of this sweet, charming, relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable series, which I highly recommend to fans of As Time Goes By.  Personally, although I did have a slight preference for As Time Goes By when I first saw A Fine Romance, I have found that following a second viewing of the latter series, I now enjoy it every bit as much as As Time Goes By. Both are absolutely delightful series that are a joy to curl up watch time and time again.",1102723200,131,1800,4.781350482315113

2057397,5,B00023BKNQ,"I watched this again. It's been a decade since I saw it the first time. This series is timeless because of the acting ability of the two leads. Judi Dench's real life husband (who died in 2001) was the male lead. They had marvelous chemistry and comedic timing between them. He plays landscape gardener Mike and she is a language translator. They are ably supported by actors playing her sister and brother-in-law. This series was where I first made the discovery that Judi was hilariously funny. I had no idea. (I saw ""Time Goes By"" after this.). It was shot in the 1980s. There is nothing which seems dated about it except that there are no computers and no internet and no cell phones. But none of that matters with great writing and great acting.",1481587200,,750,4.562962962962963
2057398,5,B00023BKNQ,I love Judi Dench and so yes I do enjoy the nice peaceful comedy.  NO four letter workds and then its even more fun to know she actually is playing the part with her real husband.,1479686400,2,179,3.9722222222222223

2057435,5,B00023BKNQ,"Found this on Acorn TV. It's hard to believe the beautiful Judi Dench is a spinster, but after a few shows, I've come to accept it. Understated British comedy. Very well done.",1456099200,,175,4.5

2057438,4,B00023BKNQ,"We always enjoy Judi Dench and this is the first time we have seen Michael work.  He is very talented.  It was warm and funny.

We will be watching it over again soon, you always see more things to enjoy on the second playing.",1439251200,,325,3.953846153846154
2057439,4,B00023BKNQ,"It's hard to give less than five stars for Judi Dench, but although her performance was as wonderful as it usually is, the other acting sometimes felt a little wooden.  I also thought that the difficulties/misunderstandings between the two lead characters were overworked.

2057459,4,B00023BKNQ,A cute romantic comedy written by Bob Larbey (Who wrote the outstanding As Time Goes By series starring Judi Dench as well).  Judi Dench is excellent as always.  Here she plays a spinsterish sister who connects with a shy and not overly successful landscaper.  The two stumble along as their relationship grows.,1425168000,,311,4.9423076923076925

2057551,5,B00023BKNQ,"A Fine Romance stars not only Dame Judi Dench, but her now deceased husband Michael Williams. Together they create, in an early 1980s world, a believable confrontational home relationship. It's dated a bit with issues and lack of sex, language, and action that seems to fuel 21st century American TV. So if you enjoy dialogue driven comedy, now period romantic comedy, unintentionally, this is great.

Why a ""NEW"" complete collection release. Likely because so many desire it, the older copies sell for more than this new set on Amazon. Advantage to the new in that all discs fit into one shelf-saving case.
SDH SUBTITLES for all 26 episodes-total about 11 hours. A keeper, not a rental.

Dench is special, & shows her giftedness in this 80s series even though it's many roles and years since her 1959 debut. ""Love in a Cold Climate"" preceded, with ""As Time Goes By"", ""Angelina Ballerina"", ""Cranford"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" only a pittance of her filmography.
Husband Michael Williams was also frequently acting in roles from ""Educating Rita"" and ""Henry V"" and more till he died in 2001.
Susan Penhaligon plays the sister in almost all of the episodes, and can be seen reading a book ""Bouquet of Barbed Wire"", which she held the leading role when adapted for TV. That's an example of the wry wit displayed throughout the series.
Her husband played by Richard Warwick, keep the romantic banter and bicker in fine tune.

Like a British Ozzie and Harriet, but two decades later, and with no kids. Like Lucy and Desi, but not as slap-stick. Likable British family sitcom viewing recommended to all my mid-life to senior friends.",1365379200,17,1663,4.890070921985815

2057593,5,B00023BKNQ,"I too am a BIG fan of As Time Goes By (and Judi Dench), and bought this series for that reason, and after having read the reviews here.  I logged on to echo others' sentiments- gentle, hilarious at times (the scene with the lost contact lens in the fancy restaurant is priceless), touching, and oddly romantic, but mostly wanted to say how very different Dame Dench is here- playing an immature misfit, a square peg in a round hole.  Her wonderful real-life husband Michael Williams is even more impressive, to my mind, nervous and nuanced, rumpled and unique, so touching and yet a delight, and this performance decades before shows like The Closer, exploring imperfect and complex people.

The dialogue is sublime, nothing on American TV even comes close, wry and funny yet utterly natural.  I don't know that I'd call it a ""light"" romantic comedy, underpinned as it is by issues like loneliness, not being able to live without someone that drives you up the wall, etc.  Another reviewer opined that there was no chemistry between them- purely in the eye of the beholder I guess but I thought there was chemistry aplenty.

Also wanted to add that if you like this I'll bet you'll also like the Peter Sellers movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoffman/dp/B00007AJE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoffman</a>, also about a seemingly mismatched couple.

If Judi Dench and Michael Williams aren't enough to grab your attention, the couple playing her sister and brother-in-law certainly ought to be.

They couple didn't have anything in common except their mutual disinterest in each other, didn't have any chemistry onscreen (although apparently in real life they were actually married), and the guy was a total loser with commitment issues and lack of social skills.

If you're an As Time Goes By fan, then it will remind you of the misunderstandings Jean and Lionel went through in the seasons prior to their marriage. However, in ""A Fine Romance"", I would have to say there are even more misunderstandings and difficulties, usually created by Laura, and one of her more common solutions is to lock herself in the closet.  Yes, a bit juvenile for a 40-something year old linguist, but that's just part of her charm.",1282780800,3,637,4.72972972972973

2057634,5,B00023BKNQ,"This DVD set is a bare-bones collection of the three seasons (the Brits call them ""series"") of A Fine Romance.

If, like me, you buy DVD sets for the show and not for special features or commentary then this is an ideal set. There are no commentaries, subtitles, or special features on these discs. The only ""special feature"" seen was a short bio/filmography for the main castmembers.

The main attraction is the only attraction - episodes of the show itself: a love story between an attractive middle-aged, smart but childish almost-spinster and a socially awkward, middle-aged struggling landscape gardener. I give the story, acting and dialogue five stars.

I almost took one star off for the DVDs because the main menu has the theme song on a loop. Other DVDs (such as the Golden Girls DVDs) do this, and it's a small pet peeve of mine. Sometimes I like to go get popcorn before sitting down to watch, and hearing the theme song on a loop gets irritating!

I recommend this product if you are a fan of the divine Judi Dench and appreciate older British comedies or are a fan of the equally delightful As Time Goes By. Also recommended if you are a fan of mature, non-cliched and un-sappy love stories.",1263772800,2,1205,4.643192488262911
2057635,5,B00023BKNQ,"Almost like the precursor for the more well known ""As Time Goes By"" (the other British Comedy), if you love the latter, you'll most probably feel the same way about the former.  A bit less polished in production and obviously less expensively staged, the outstanding talents of Dame Judi and her real-life husband (Michael Williams) playing her love-interest made the outcome warm and cozy and sooooooooo funny.  Sooooooooooo human.

They both play 40-ish single people who are looking for a relationship.  They are brought together and the series goes on to watch their love grow, through sad times and happy ones.

Some reviewers might say the series is ""dated,"" but I see it as nostalgic.  I had never even heard of the series when I found it listed on Amazon.  I am simply dedicated to Dame Judi and her wide spectrum of work that it was a wonderful discovery and I was overjoyed to find this early vehicle.

2057638,4,B00023BKNQ,"Dame Judi Dench OBE CH wasn't a Dame when she acted in this series with her real-life husband, the charming Michael Williams. She plays Laura Dalton, a cerebral linguist, single, and almost 40. Her married sister is played by charming Susan Penhaligon and Richard Warwick plays her brother-in-law. At her party, her sister and brother-in-law have invited somebody to match with Laura. Michael Williams' character is blue collar working class guy with a shop, drives a van, and is adorable. I can see why Michael and Judi had such a wonderful marriage in real life. In this series which was unusual for a celebrated actress like Judi Dench in the first place, she comes across as a natural and has fun with it. Dench and Williams enjoyed working together whether on screen or on stage and had one of the best marriages in this difficult business.

I will say that the series is a bit dry British humor and avoids the slapstick humor or physical comedy like some others but I enjoy that. This series is a mature, blend of comedy and relationships without going overboard. Judi's Laura can be condascending and sensitive to the fact that she's still single while her younger sister isn't anymore. Every married couple wants to fix up those who are single, don't they? Well, they find a nice, fine match with Williams and Dench whose characters probably wouldn't get together unless they tricked into it.
