3051333,1,B0010VDYLK,"Jeremy Sumpter stars as Gavin, the leader of a group of awkward teens who are into fantasy movies and sword play.  They have two groups of adversaries - the 20-something neighbors next door (Justin Long and Joey Kern) and some teens from school.  One day while exploring a local park, Gavin and his friends find huge footprints, which they assume belong to Sasquatch (Big Foot).  What follows involves a lot of slapstick and sophomoric attempts at humor.

I have to admit that I watched ""The Sasquatch Gang"" because it looked like it would be bad, in a silly way.  However, I was shocked at just how inept this movie is.  The plot seems best suited for a children's film; however, the PG-13 rating and crude tone are totally inappropriate for children.  I was really confused by the movie until I read that the director (Tim Skousen) was the first assistant director on ""Napolean Dynamite.""  Suddenly, I understood why nothing fit together; they stole the humor from ""Napolean Dynamite"" and the plot from ""The Goonies.""  What a mess!  The plot is too juvenile for teens and adults, and the tone is too adult for children.  ""The Sasquatch Gang"" is one of the more pointless movies I've watched in years.  I have no idea what the target audience is or who will enjoy this movie.",1221868800,7,1276,4.672645739910314
3051334,1,B0010VDYLK,"This movie has very little going for it over all. Despite an attempt at some swish production techniques, ""Sasquatch Gang"" (released outside the USA as  ""Sasquatch Dumpling Gang"") mostly just bumbles along from one crude slap-stick scene to another, with some truly cringe-making and juvenile dialogue making the whole production ultimately more embarrassing than funny. The movie's one clever feature, which aims to provide some structure and story-line interlinking, fails to work too, largely owing to the fact that the film has no real story-lines to connect!  There are a couple of amusing moments, but I for one certainly didn't find it worth sitting through the other 80 tedious minutes to find them.",1220054400,6,707,5.247787610619469
3051335,5,B0010VDYLK,"This is a charming little film that will appeal to all ages.
It centers around a small group of friends somewhere in a small town who would be characterized as ""misfits"". They are bullied by the neighbor across the street and some local kids as well. It's a comedy but it has such a warm and tender ingredient to it that it pulls you right in. You can really identify with these kids and the cool thing about this is that it is simply kids being kids. It explores the world of adolescence and brings you back to when you were in that age.  It contains some very funny moments as well as some touching scenes as well.
It reminds me of one of those ABC Afterschool Specials in the 1970's as it touches on so many subjects.  I really recommend this film, it will charm the socks off of you.",1220054400,6,787,4.2052980132450335
3051336,4,B0010VDYLK,"Every so often you come across a film that completely takes you by surprise! 'The Sasquatch Gang' is just such a film! While watching this film I could not help but think of 'Napoleon Dynamite'. It's got that kind of quirky charm and several cast members from ""Napoleon"" are in this film in small roles or cameos. This is definitely a winner and should not be overlooked! I caught this on a HD cable channel, so I'm not sure of any of the DVD features or quality.",1219708800,8,463,4.333333333333333
3051337,5,B0010VDYLK,I stumbled across this movie last night and at first wasn't sure if it was stupid or genius. I soon found myself laughing out loud and couldn't take my eyes away. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. Brilliant.,1218844800,6,219,4.365853658536586
3051338,5,B0010VDYLK,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend, who said it was one of the funniest films he's ever seen. I'm always a little sceptical when people tell me this, as I've been tricked into watching really lame movies many times. This one, however, definitely lived up to my friend's description. I was expecting something similar to Napoleon Dynamite when I put it on, which is essentially what I got. But I believe this film is even better.

The actors all have brilliant comedic delivery (especially Justin Long as the character Zerk and his friend Shirts) and the plot is interesting and unique (something unusual for a comedy). It depicts ""nerds"" and ""losers"" in a funny and sort of affectionate way. It's really refreshing to see something like this, when all other comedies out there are either terrible teen flicks or the dreaded ""romantic comedy"" genre.

I've already watched it four times since I bought it, which, for me, is always a sign of a good movie. I think this would appeal to just about anyone, kids and adults alike. Definitely check it out!",1204588800,25,1058,4.713513513513513
3051339,5,B0010VDYLK,"This is one of those films that you really don't know what to expect. No surprise since it's the creation of the Napoleon Dynamite crew, this is a really quirky, laugh-out-loud funny movie. I enjoyed it immensely. It has several really unique and funny characters including Justin Long as the mulletted freak. Also his friend ""Shirt"" is really funny in his line delivery. I like the way they showed the sword fighting and just the overall sense of a quirky world.",1199750400,12,463,4.728395061728395

3051344,3,B0010VDYLK,"Certainly enjoyable.  While it was quirky and at times it seemed emulate ""Napoleon Dynamite"" I found the general pacing of the movie smoother and quicker than ""Dynamite.""  There were times where ""Dynamite"" seemed to drag and this movie did not.  While the acting performances where not Oscar worthy they where not terrible.  The plot isn't all to interesting or engaging, but it is entertaining and some of the humor is subtle.  It's worth looking at.  Just don't expect it to have a ""cult-film"" like  quality too it",1487116800,,516,4.862068965517241

3051388,4,B0010VDYLK,"""The Sasquatch Gang"" has been compared to ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and for good reason. Featured here is an entire cast of misfits, none of whom are particularly good at their chosen niches, but all of whom coalesce to entertain in a fairly brainless but funny way. I actually was surprised how much I liked this peculiar comedy that hinges on Sasquatch dung, and while relatively little actually happens in the film, the bizarre scenarios and characters are great.

If you are interested in a battleax named ""The Berserker"", or what is perhaps the funniest kiss in screen history, this is for you. Likewise if you want to see a repossessed Firebird enter a demolition derby out of protest, you must see this film. For me the two biggest reasons to see the movie are the characters of Sophie (Addie Land) and mumbling sidekick Shirts (Joey Kern), both of whom never failed to make me smile, although I would be remiss if I didn't point out Carl Weathers as Bigfoot excrement specialist Dr. Artimus Snodgrass, whose over-the-top performance made me laugh out loud.

""The Sasquatch Gang"" is a weird little movie that deserves more attention than it has received. If you need to laugh at something truly ridiculous, this fits the bill perfectly.",1481846400,,1238,4.862559241706161

While this would win any awards, it has funny moments in it and has lots of quotes that can be used in many situations.  Funny movie, stupid movie, movie for geeks whatever, if you have nerd kids or just like goofy movies this is worth a watch, but it may be hard to find as people find it and get hold of it. My daughter lost the first copy and it was a little spendy trying to find another copy to maintain in the collection of Nerd-flicks as we call them.",1479686400,,531,4.096153846153846

3051686,4,B0010VDYLK,"So, years ago, I stumbled across this film on Comedy Central and really enjoyed it. It's an odd, quirky little film similar to Napoleon Dynamite in that sense. I won't say it's as good as that one, but it's pretty darn good. It's basically about this group of socially awkward teens who like to play medieval battles with foam swords and staffs. One of them lives near a high school dropout who is rarely without his sidekick,and the pair seem almost 100 percent like a live-action Beavis and Butthead, if just a bit older, because I'd assume they're supposed to be 20-something. The Butthead-kinda-guy, played by always funny Justin Long (where has he been lately?), ends up badly in need of money to avoid his sweet car getting repossessed. He and his pal concoct this bigfoot hoax while watching a report on a famous bigfoot expert on TV, thinking they'll make a fortune selling casts of the fake bigfoot prints they intend to make in the nearby woods. They go about creating fake bigfoot dung (using food items) setting up their prints, and the awkward kids happen to be the first ones to run across it. Amazingly, their plan seems to start to work, as it quickly ends up on the TV news. Meanwhile, there is another, possibly more important plotline, that of the romance between one of the awkward kids (played by Jeremy Sumpter, who starred in the best Peter Pan bigscreen flick since the Disney animated version) and an equally awkward girl whom everyone tells needs to lose weight, even though she really doesn't, resulting in her having her mouth wired shut. Yeah, that part sounds a bit rough for a pretty family friendly comedy, but overall, it's a great, very fun and funny little flick. Part lighthearted teen romance (with a big focus on the jealous best friend of Sumpter more than a lot of mushy stuff), and part Beavis and Butthead. Now, I said this was something of a family flick. I don't recall anything off the top of my head to make it not one. I could be forgetting something, but also, I grew up in the 80's, so my idea of family flick may be a bit different than yours, ha. But, yeah, this reminded me a lot of Napoleon Dynamite in the overall style, even though it is very different. It's not from the same director, though I could have believed it, but Jon Heder (AKA Napoleon) does have like a 2-second cameo, ha.

This IS available on Blu-Ray, by the way, which is what I have. I found it in a new 3 dollar blu-ray bin at the front of Wal-Mart. It was probably the only thing in that bin I thought was worth buying, but I wasn't inspired to dig too deep. The cover looks really cheap, like this movie is just public domain or something and some generic dollar bluray company jumped on it. The printing of the image is even a bit pixelated. I wondered if it would just be DVD quality. Well, I took it home, and I'm not an expert, but it looked blu-ray quality to me. I mean, the disc is bare bones, but it had a decent menu and played gorgeously. If you find this one, I do recommend picking it up.",1445126400,,3025,4.430879712746858

3051705,4,B0010VDYLK,"i liked it, but at the same time i can see why a lot of people might not too. it's a quirky movie. i really thought i wouldn't like it, especially when i saw that it was made by the creators of Napoleon Dynamite. so because of a dislike of Napoleon Dynamite, i was quick to judge. if i'm to be honest, initially i didn't like it after watching for only 10 minutes in. it did seem to grow on me as the movie went on. by the time the movie was over, i found myself strangely having enjoyed this goofy movie.

so look, i can understand that slapstick, cheesy, goofy, pie in the face humour might not be everyones thing. not everyone finds movies that play on common stereotypes (like nerds, high school students and southerners that sport mullets) amusing. i myself normally don't. however it might surprise you. i enjoyed this movie, but i think this movie is either one you'll love or you'll hate. it's definitely worth a lucky dip.",1442275200,,931,4.381502890173411

Jeremy Coon who produced some Napoleon family tree movies was also on board.  So it did have some of the same touches.  But the pacing at times was boring and the humor fell flat when it was so close to brilliant.  The characters are classic and the story line is set up for side splitting experiences.  But somehow the director doesn't seem to know how to pull it off.  The actors are perfect and the costumes are spot-on.  I recommend one viewing of this movie for the purpose of experiencing this world.  But its just not that funny, and I am a lifelong champion of this type of humor.

It's about these 3 nerd guys who LARPing and into things like that and the main one of them likes this girl who works at a video store and they do things together.  Then this redneck bully Zeek, Justin Long, picks on Gavin, the main nerd.  So Zeek has a mullet and cut off t-shirt and hangs out with a shirtless friend who has a big gulp in his hand always.

The movie is shot from different POV's so you may see the same scene twice but from different POV's and different stories too.  You have Gavin and his story.  The girl and hers.  Then Zeek and his.

Zeek wants to make money so tries to make fake Sasquatch poo and foot prints.

The Girl works at the movie store and thinks she is fat so she wires her mouth shut.

Gavin the cool nerd has his story.

3051890,3,B0010VDYLK,"A tale of three sword-wielding super-geeks who believe they've stumbled upon evidence that Bigfoot lives in the woods outside of town, ""The Sasquatch Gang"" is so goofy and good-natured in its demeanor and tone that only a complete curmudgeon would be mean enough to criticize it.

Jeremy Sumpter (of TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") leads the trio of mono-toned, monosyllabic nerds who regularly suffer the slings and arrows (or, more accurately, paint-ball guns) of the even more zonked-out and inarticulate town bullies, led by Justin Long.

The movie has just enough wit, tenderness and charm to overcome some of its essential blandness, and its portrayal of first love can be really quite endearing at times.  However, the movie is considerably less successful when it goes for the broadly comic, becoming merely juvenile and silly at such moments.

Concerned parents should note that ""The Sasquatch Gang"" is more than appropriate for a pre-teen/early teen audience (think of it as the ""clean"" version of ""Superbad"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"").  Anyone older than that, however, may find it a bit too much on the innocuous side to be worth their time or money.",1269648000,,1158,5.073684210526316

When the outcasts stumble (literally) upon the spoor, they alert the media and suffer the effects of jealousy and first loves. Don't expect a lot of depth or even plot, but do expect enough unusual characters and one-liners to keep you entertained.

I rely heavily on the users' reviews on Amazon and have had good luck doing so for years. I was extremely let down this time. This movie has been compared to Napoleon Dynamite and it's been said that it's even funnier. Well Napoleon was funny for what it was. This (almost a roundabout) follow-up pales in comparison even to that. Now don't get me wrong, I can find humor in most anything including what I predetermined would be a very miserable movie, Step Brothers. I hate Will Farrel and that ugly John C Scott Reily turd. But it has many many laughs. I sat through about 40 minutes of this Sasquatch movie without so much as a chuckle. Every line in the script ends with someone calling someone else a name like crap-head. It's like they took a couple of things that worked for Napoleon and duplicated them in this much worse movie...and it doesn't work. I never watched the entire film, well, because for a comedy to not provide a single moment of humor after 40 minutes, it's just not worth watching till the end. Don't waste your time or money!

So I made my sister watch it to see if she liked it as much as I did, then we made my husband watch it too. All three of us thought the movie was great so I bought it. I love Jeremy Long and am glad that he broadened his horizons in this ridiculous movie.",1234828800,4,324,3.8507462686567164
3285830,1,B0010VDYLK,"Jeremy Sumpter stars as Gavin, the leader of a group of awkward teens who are into fantasy movies and sword play.  They have two groups of adversaries - the 20-something neighbors next door (Justin Long and Joey Kern) and some teens from school.  One day while exploring a local park, Gavin and his friends find huge footprints, which they assume belong to Sasquatch (Big Foot).  What follows involves a lot of slapstick and sophomoric attempts at humor.

I have to admit that I watched ""The Sasquatch Gang"" because it looked like it would be bad, in a silly way.  However, I was shocked at just how inept this movie is.  The plot seems best suited for a children's film; however, the PG-13 rating and crude tone are totally inappropriate for children.  I was really confused by the movie until I read that the director (Tim Skousen) was the first assistant director on ""Napolean Dynamite.""  Suddenly, I understood why nothing fit together; they stole the humor from ""Napolean Dynamite"" and the plot from ""The Goonies.""  What a mess!  The plot is too juvenile for teens and adults, and the tone is too adult for children.  ""The Sasquatch Gang"" is one of the more pointless movies I've watched in years.  I have no idea what the target audience is or who will enjoy this movie.",1221868800,7,1276,4.672645739910314
3285831,1,B0010VDYLK,"This movie has very little going for it over all. Despite an attempt at some swish production techniques, ""Sasquatch Gang"" (released outside the USA as  ""Sasquatch Dumpling Gang"") mostly just bumbles along from one crude slap-stick scene to another, with some truly cringe-making and juvenile dialogue making the whole production ultimately more embarrassing than funny. The movie's one clever feature, which aims to provide some structure and story-line interlinking, fails to work too, largely owing to the fact that the film has no real story-lines to connect!  There are a couple of amusing moments, but I for one certainly didn't find it worth sitting through the other 80 tedious minutes to find them.",1220054400,6,707,5.247787610619469
3285832,5,B0010VDYLK,"This is a charming little film that will appeal to all ages.
It centers around a small group of friends somewhere in a small town who would be characterized as ""misfits"". They are bullied by the neighbor across the street and some local kids as well. It's a comedy but it has such a warm and tender ingredient to it that it pulls you right in. You can really identify with these kids and the cool thing about this is that it is simply kids being kids. It explores the world of adolescence and brings you back to when you were in that age.  It contains some very funny moments as well as some touching scenes as well.
It reminds me of one of those ABC Afterschool Specials in the 1970's as it touches on so many subjects.  I really recommend this film, it will charm the socks off of you.",1220054400,6,787,4.2052980132450335
3285833,4,B0010VDYLK,"Every so often you come across a film that completely takes you by surprise! 'The Sasquatch Gang' is just such a film! While watching this film I could not help but think of 'Napoleon Dynamite'. It's got that kind of quirky charm and several cast members from ""Napoleon"" are in this film in small roles or cameos. This is definitely a winner and should not be overlooked! I caught this on a HD cable channel, so I'm not sure of any of the DVD features or quality.",1219708800,8,463,4.333333333333333

3285835,5,B0010VDYLK,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend, who said it was one of the funniest films he's ever seen. I'm always a little sceptical when people tell me this, as I've been tricked into watching really lame movies many times. This one, however, definitely lived up to my friend's description. I was expecting something similar to Napoleon Dynamite when I put it on, which is essentially what I got. But I believe this film is even better.

The actors all have brilliant comedic delivery (especially Justin Long as the character Zerk and his friend Shirts) and the plot is interesting and unique (something unusual for a comedy). It depicts ""nerds"" and ""losers"" in a funny and sort of affectionate way. It's really refreshing to see something like this, when all other comedies out there are either terrible teen flicks or the dreaded ""romantic comedy"" genre.

I've already watched it four times since I bought it, which, for me, is always a sign of a good movie. I think this would appeal to just about anyone, kids and adults alike. Definitely check it out!",1204588800,25,1058,4.713513513513513

There were times where ""Dynamite"" seemed to drag and this movie did not.  While the acting performances where not Oscar worthy they where not terrible.  The plot isn't all to interesting or engaging, but it is entertaining and some of the humor is subtle.  It's worth looking at.

3285885,4,B0010VDYLK,"""The Sasquatch Gang"" has been compared to ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and for good reason. Featured here is an entire cast of misfits, none of whom are particularly good at their chosen niches, but all of whom coalesce to entertain in a fairly brainless but funny way. I actually was surprised how much I liked this peculiar comedy that hinges on Sasquatch dung, and while relatively little actually happens in the film, the bizarre scenarios and characters are great.

If you are interested in a battleax named ""The Berserker"", or what is perhaps the funniest kiss in screen history, this is for you. Likewise if you want to see a repossessed Firebird enter a demolition derby out of protest, you must see this film. For me the two biggest reasons to see the movie are the characters of Sophie (Addie Land) and mumbling sidekick Shirts (Joey Kern), both of whom never failed to make me smile, although I would be remiss if I didn't point out Carl Weathers as Bigfoot excrement specialist Dr. Artimus Snodgrass, whose over-the-top performance made me laugh out loud.

""The Sasquatch Gang"" is a weird little movie that deserves more attention than it has received. If you need to laugh at something truly ridiculous, this fits the bill perfectly.",1481846400,,1238,4.862559241706161

3286183,4,B0010VDYLK,"So, years ago, I stumbled across this film on Comedy Central and really enjoyed it. It's an odd, quirky little film similar to Napoleon Dynamite in that sense. I won't say it's as good as that one, but it's pretty darn good. It's basically about this group of socially awkward teens who like to play medieval battles with foam swords and staffs. One of them lives near a high school dropout who is rarely without his sidekick,and the pair seem almost 100 percent like a live-action Beavis and Butthead, if just a bit older, because I'd assume they're supposed to be 20-something. The Butthead-kinda-guy, played by always funny Justin Long (where has he been lately?), ends up badly in need of money to avoid his sweet car getting repossessed. He and his pal concoct this bigfoot hoax while watching a report on a famous bigfoot expert on TV, thinking they'll make a fortune selling casts of the fake bigfoot prints they intend to make in the nearby woods. They go about creating fake bigfoot dung (using food items) setting up their prints, and the awkward kids happen to be the first ones to run across it. Amazingly, their plan seems to start to work, as it quickly ends up on the TV news. Meanwhile, there is another, possibly more important plotline, that of the romance between one of the awkward kids (played by Jeremy Sumpter, who starred in the best Peter Pan bigscreen flick since the Disney animated version) and an equally awkward girl whom everyone tells needs to lose weight, even though she really doesn't, resulting in her having her mouth wired shut. Yeah, that part sounds a bit rough for a pretty family friendly comedy, but overall, it's a great, very fun and funny little flick. Part lighthearted teen romance (with a big focus on the jealous best friend of Sumpter more than a lot of mushy stuff), and part Beavis and Butthead. Now, I said this was something of a family flick. I don't recall anything off the top of my head to make it not one. I could be forgetting something, but also, I grew up in the 80's, so my idea of family flick may be a bit different than yours, ha. But, yeah, this reminded me a lot of Napoleon Dynamite in the overall style, even though it is very different. It's not from the same director, though I could have believed it, but Jon Heder (AKA Napoleon) does have like a 2-second cameo, ha.

This IS available on Blu-Ray, by the way, which is what I have. I found it in a new 3 dollar blu-ray bin at the front of Wal-Mart. It was probably the only thing in that bin I thought was worth buying, but I wasn't inspired to dig too deep. The cover looks really cheap, like this movie is just public domain or something and some generic dollar bluray company jumped on it. The printing of the image is even a bit pixelated. I wondered if it would just be DVD quality. Well, I took it home, and I'm not an expert, but it looked blu-ray quality to me. I mean, the disc is bare bones, but it had a decent menu and played gorgeously. If you find this one, I do recommend picking it up.",1445126400,,3025,4.430879712746858

so look, i can understand that slapstick, cheesy, goofy, pie in the face humour might not be everyones thing. not everyone finds movies that play on common stereotypes (like nerds, high school students and southerners that sport mullets) amusing. i myself normally don't. however it might surprise you. i enjoyed this movie, but i think this movie is either one you'll love or you'll hate. it's definitely worth a lucky dip.",1442275200,,931,4.381502890173411

Jeremy Coon who produced some Napoleon family tree movies was also on board.  So it did have some of the same touches.  But the pacing at times was boring and the humor fell flat when it was so close to brilliant.  The characters are classic and the story line is set up for side splitting experiences.  But somehow the director doesn't seem to know how to pull it off.  The actors are perfect and the costumes are spot-on.

It's about these 3 nerd guys who LARPing and into things like that and the main one of them likes this girl who works at a video store and they do things together.  Then this redneck bully Zeek, Justin Long, picks on Gavin, the main nerd.  So Zeek has a mullet and cut off t-shirt and hangs out with a shirtless friend who has a big gulp in his hand always.

The movie is shot from different POV's so you may see the same scene twice but from different POV's and different stories too.  You have Gavin and his story.  The girl and hers.  Then Zeek and his.

Zeek wants to make money so tries to make fake Sasquatch poo and foot prints.

The Girl works at the movie store and thinks she is fat so she wires her mouth shut.

Gavin the cool nerd has his story.

3286387,3,B0010VDYLK,"A tale of three sword-wielding super-geeks who believe they've stumbled upon evidence that Bigfoot lives in the woods outside of town, ""The Sasquatch Gang"" is so goofy and good-natured in its demeanor and tone that only a complete curmudgeon would be mean enough to criticize it.

Jeremy Sumpter (of TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") leads the trio of mono-toned, monosyllabic nerds who regularly suffer the slings and arrows (or, more accurately, paint-ball guns) of the even more zonked-out and inarticulate town bullies, led by Justin Long.

The movie has just enough wit, tenderness and charm to overcome some of its essential blandness, and its portrayal of first love can be really quite endearing at times.  However, the movie is considerably less successful when it goes for the broadly comic, becoming merely juvenile and silly at such moments.

Concerned parents should note that ""The Sasquatch Gang"" is more than appropriate for a pre-teen/early teen audience (think of it as the ""clean"" version of ""Superbad"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"").

When the outcasts stumble (literally) upon the spoor, they alert the media and suffer the effects of jealousy and first loves.

This movie has been compared to Napoleon Dynamite and it's been said that it's even funnier. Well Napoleon was funny for what it was. This (almost a roundabout) follow-up pales in comparison even to that. Now don't get me wrong, I can find humor in most anything including what I predetermined would be a very miserable movie, Step Brothers. I hate Will Farrel and that ugly John C Scott Reily turd. But it has many many laughs. I sat through about 40 minutes of this Sasquatch movie without so much as a chuckle. Every line in the script ends with someone calling someone else a name like crap-head. It's like they took a couple of things that worked for Napoleon and duplicated them in this much worse movie...and it doesn't work. I never watched the entire film, well, because for a comedy to not provide a single moment of humor after 40 minutes, it's just not worth watching till the end. Don't waste your time or money!

3286391,5,B0010VDYLK,"This movie has the same quirky humor as Napoleon Dynamite but is twice as funny. The story revolves around some nerdy kids, a couple of jobless young adults, one who never wears a shirt and the other who needs to get a lot of money and fast, and Sasquatch. It is easily one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend it.",1246147200,,341,4.2615384615384615
3286392,5,B0010VDYLK,The Sasquatch Gang is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life. Its so good that I watched it 5 times in one day... its one of those movies that you can just watch repeatedly and never get tired of. Give it a chance! Its hilarious!,1245110400,,241,3.938775510204082

So I made my sister watch it to see if she liked it as much as I did, then we made my husband watch it too. All three of us thought the movie was great so I bought it. I love Jeremy Long and am glad that he broadened his horizons in this ridiculous movie.",1234828800,4,324,3.8507462686567164

8238642,5,B0010VDYLK,"As othersr said in there review, sort of quirky, but if you like Napoleon Dynamite... You will really enjoy this movie. Give it a chance, it becomes addicting. It's great for all ages, hardly any cussing if any cussing at all... Definitely no F words, I really honestly don't know why they rated it PG-13. It should be maybe PG. Really good movie",1516492800,,346,4.507936507936508

It's a coming of age, teenage dork movie with great humor and none of the gratuitous swearing or smut. I have watched it at least a dozen times, and I still laugh out loud. Kind of along the same vein as Nacho Libre.",1497571200,,351,3.888888888888889
