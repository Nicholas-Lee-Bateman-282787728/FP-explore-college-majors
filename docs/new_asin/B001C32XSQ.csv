8285728,4,B001C32XSQ,"I have been dancing for 1.5 years and these are my second purchase of Michelle's DVD's.  I have Drills Drills etc. and that looks great.  I got this set for a more beginner focused set before really working on the drills one as I am a stickler for getting the basics right before moving on.

Michelles DVD's are very well made - even tho these are her older ones.  The set of 3 do duplicate a bit, (same moves in all three but different exercises) but they were so cheap in price I don't mind.

Michell helped me get a handle on good technique for doing '8's without raising heels (an optional stylisation), for doing a slow shimmy with good technique, and excellent instruction on undulations.  Also variations on shimmy - on lunge position etc.

There aren't a lot of different moves, or flash choreo for these - I would rate them as good little drill come exercise DVD's.

If you are a beginner and want to learn a lot of technique then there are ones like Jenna's, Amira's, Sadie's, Jehans, Amber (oh yea I have a DVD addiction) but these are really great, short and sweet drilling and strengthening basics.

Not flash, but very good value for money for the beginner.

They will always have a place when I don't want to brain strain but want to have a fun drill and a little sweat.

I dont' think you can go wrong with any of Michelle's DVD's",1308700800,10,1346,4.387096774193548

8285730,4,B001C32XSQ,Works all the places you would think it should.  Gets a little monotonous after awhile but that can be said of almost all video workouts.,1250640000,,137,4.48
8285731,5,B001C32XSQ,"Just wanted to mention that this series is a re-release of Michelle's 'Perfect Hips"", ""Body by Bellydance"" and ""Belly Dance Basics"".  All are quality, top selling DVDs, but if you already own them this content will be the same.",1219104000,36,227,4.82051282051282
