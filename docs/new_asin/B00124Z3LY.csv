As the name implies, ""Liar Game"" is a drama based on a game of deceit and lies, pitting contestants against each other. The games are highly intellectual, as well as mind-boggling. An exceptionally good drama.",1424822400,,276,4.8936170212765955
8243901,3,B00124Z3LY,"Exactly what Attish said. It was fantastic and everything, up to a certain point in the Contraband game, then it's in complete Engrish and makes zero sense. Really disappointed the original translator hadn't done the entire thing :(",1324857600,,232,5.131578947368421
8243902,3,B00124Z3LY,"I purchased this one along with ""2009 Japanese Drama : LIAR GAME II w/ Eng Sub"" from the same supplier. I got two DVD's different from what I ordered, though. I recieved ""Liar Game Season 1-2"" and the Japanese movie ""Kaiji"".
The Season 1-2 was great - pictures ans sound followed eachother, the solution was good... But the subs only came out good until the end of season 1 and the end of season 2. The last episodes in each season have got wierd subs that don't match logically, and the names change in the subs, too. Other than that, the acting's great, and hte whole concept of the Liar Game was well thought of :)",1299628800,2,617,4.327586206896552
8243903,4,B00124Z3LY,"This series is a great mind game type of drama that relies heavily on mental warfare and mathmatics.  The acting is good and in particular Fuku really steals alot of scenes for being a antagonist.  I will have to warn you though, the last two episodes are subtitled horribly and you can not effectively read them.

The names change to chinese and alot of times the sentences either are not wrapped properly/ getting cut off, don't make sense, filled with typos, only stay on screen sometimes for less than 2 seconds or are just completely left off during conversations which pretty much leaves the ending of the first series not understandable.

Really the biggest downfall is not being able to finish the first series.  I thought I could deal with poor subtitle but this is beyond poor.  You would be better off finding the last two episodes on line with proper subbing.",1269993600,10,871,4.697368421052632
