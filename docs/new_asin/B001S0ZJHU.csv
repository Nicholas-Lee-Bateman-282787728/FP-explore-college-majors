8339309,1,B001S0ZJHU,"This guy, ""Dr,"" David Anderson is no Dr. at all. When specifically asked and researched, he can't name one peer-reviewed journal article he's participated in, ""because there are so many,"" he said. There is no record of him ever attending the schools he's purported to have attended, and his address is some Po Box in a dumpy part of NY. This guy is a total fraud and is burning these dvd's at hm and trying to sell them and it's a total waste of money, rip off and giant scam from a scam artist con-man.",1366588800,4,503,4.3052631578947365
8339310,1,B001S0ZJHU,"I bought this as a gift. I had to return the first one and get another one. The first DVD played for a couple of minutes & then nothing. The 2nd DVD would NOT play at all on the regular DVD player, ONLY on a region free DVD player. Also neither one was shrink wrapped or sealed, & was ""bouncing"" around in the case. I was bored after 5 minutes, but then I did buy it as a gift. NOT what I expected for the money.",1292976000,7,412,3.802325581395349
8339311,3,B001S0ZJHU,"I had high hopes for this DVD. I had the same issues as the other reviewer. The DVD seemed to start after the program was already going, it skipped a lot. The material was great, I have heard most of these theories before, many references to the great scientists in the field. All in all most people would be incredibly frustrated with the skipping, mine looked like it was burned at home, no menus, if you try to pause or rewind, it stopped the program and you had to start from the beginning again. If the company that produced this is actually sending it out to sell this way they won't sell many.",1281052800,7,600,4.31858407079646
8339312,2,B001S0ZJHU,"This is the second dvd I've ordered and it still does the same thing, skips ahead a couple sentences every 40 seconds or so.",1267920000,6,124,4.208333333333333
