3702767,5,B001MYIXAM,"Anyone who is a fan of Michael Rappaport is sure to love this movie but even if you aren't a known fan of his, this movie has a lot to offer.

I would suggest not reading too much about the plot because honestly I felt the way they promoted this movie was right, they just stuck to telling you he takes an experimental drug and gets super powers. But the synopsis on just about every site out there spoils a fairly early ""twist"" and I ddon't see any reason for it.

Without giving much away this movie has a lot of really nice ""human"" moments. Those moments that most people out there can really connect to the character with. Some are funny, some are sad, some are just plain strange.

But one thing this movie doesn't do is disappoint.

If you are unsure, either download it from Amazon Unbox or rent the movie from your preferred renter, but definitely give this movie a shot, you may find, like me, that it will make a spot on your DVD shelf to call it's home.",1238803200,24,964,4.251366120218579

3702781,3,B001MYIXAM,"When adventuring off the grid to low-budget independent movies one usually is pleasantly inspired by plot, acting, and the depth of character that main-stream Hollywood usually reserves for Oscar-winner-type pictures.  Special is the story of an everyday sort of nobody (Michael Rapaport) who works as a meter man and loves silly comics.  When he takes part in an experimental drug program he discovers another world.  The pills he is taking gives him incredible super powers.  What does an everyday sheep do with telepathy, levitation, teleportation?  Watch and see.

Michael Rapaport is the perfect actor to play this banal, awkward role, because he is believable.  I look at him and (even back in the days of True Romance) still find it hard to believe he's a Hollywood entity.  There is a looseness, an ineptitude, and lack of panache that Rapaport delivers (whether on purpose or  naturally) that makes me despise him just a little bit.  The movie is entertaining.  There are moments of clarity and confusion in equal abundance.  One ventures into the outskirts of mainstream Hollywood to be amazed, horrified, cleverly entertained with the removal of big-budget persuasiveness.  Special gets several nods but in the end Rapaport's mewling undercuts the cleverness of the film.  It comes off as bland.  It plays like a grad student's film project. There are better films out there.  It's worth a rent.  Not sure that it's worth a buy.  I just expected a bit more.

Meh.",1412121600,,1474,5.04149377593361
3702782,4,B001MYIXAM,A Most Unusual Movie-This movie is a great original storyline with great acting to go with it. Michael shows his acting chops. Several minor characters should have been more developed and giving more time especially the stuttering cashier. One of the most unusual movies I have ever seen.

3702783,5,B001MYIXAM,"DON'T watch this expecting a superhero movie.  DO watch it because it's a terrific movie about a guy whose life goes off the tracks in a way that's simultaneously hilarious and scary.  It's a drama with some comedy, not a comedy with some drama.  Rapaport does an excellent job conveying the pathos of a decent man whose mind is swirling around the drain.  It could easily have failed but he pulls it off.  But I repeat: it's NOT a superhero movie, not even the ""Kick-Ass"" kind.",1405728000,2,478,4.511627906976744

The part where he's locked in the bathroom all night is just plain ridiculous.  I mean, obviously if someone is beat up within an inch of his life, the girl would have called 911 for him, right?  And Alexandra Holden's  stutter was totally unbelievable.  I've liked her in other roles I've seen her in, but she does not pull this one off.  Two thumbs 'WAY down on this one.

3702800,5,B001MYIXAM,"The main character Les is such a nice guy that my heart really went out to him. He lives the type of responsible but mundane, and at times unfulfilling, life that many of us in Western culture can identify with. Suddenly, after participating in a drug study of a substance that is designed to ""remove self doubt"",  he's been empowered with super-human abilities. His desire is to use them to help stop crimes and protect victims, which he does to various degrees of success. Our hero is kind and very persistant in pursuing what he believes is right despite other's attempts to subdo his enthusiasm, prevent him from hurting himself, and/or stop him from drawing unwanted publicity to the drug in question.
Overall a very clever, enjoyable movie with a thoughtful concept.",1346803200,3,772,4.848484848484849

When the drug alters his perception of reality, his mind takes the cue to mean he's developed super powers, which he immediately applies to the streets as a self-styled hero. A dark comedy that's quite similar to Rainn Wilson's odd superhero send-up Super, it's often hopelessly lost in the deep, complicated middle ground between absurdist comedy and bleak, grizzled reality. Character actor and stand-up comic Michael Rapaport plays a good sympathetic lead, but his naive nature and good intentions only make the tribulations he endures that much more difficult for the viewing audience. It's a light, energetic first act that's backed by a tough, distressed greater story, and the frequent reminders that the protagonist is hallucinating steal most of the drama from its root concept. A troubling little package that can't quite settle its own private identity crisis.",1343606400,,1042,5.398773006134969

3702807,5,B001MYIXAM,"This movie pulled me in first with belly laughs. As I watched, the story moved me from its comedic beginning to a point where I cared deeply about the troubled, delusional Les. Every character in this film seems to be perfectly cast. Though the film sometimes slips into underdeveloped ideas, it continues to carry the viewer with some very poignant scenes. The story ends with a superhero-worthy titanic struggle of good vs. evil - Rapaport's personification of Everyman's quest for meaning against Paul Blackthorne's evil. Les tries to live up to his vision, ""a villain can launch a missile at a superhero, and the hero just keeps coming... A real superhero is like a force of nature."" This film is like a force of nature.",1272240000,2,724,4.8
3702808,4,B001MYIXAM,"This above-average but anti-climactic low-budget indie psychodrama ""Special (RX) Specioprin Hydrochloride"" depicts the psychotic delusions that a shy young guy suffers from after he participates in clandestine drug testing program. ""True Romance"" star Michael Rapaport excels as deranged protagonist Les Franken, and Rapaport's performance testifies to his genius as an actor that he can forge a genuinely sympathetic character who could easily have been portrayed as a shallow lunatic. Unfortunately, freshman co-scenarists & directors Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore fail to develop their screenplay past its provocative premise. Happily, they shun the low road which would have made ""Special"" into a lame-brained, predicable comedy. Instead, they play everything extremely straight and narrow so this satirical character study of a pathetic man becomes a parable about paranoia. The subtlety with which they handle the action in the early stages makes ""Special"" appear promising, but the luster grows tarnished about an hour into this 81-minute epic.

Les Franken is an anonymous meter cop for the Los Angeles Police Department. He writes parking citations during the day. Once he starts writing a ticket, he claims that he cannot stop the process. Nevertheless, when a woman gives him a sob story about her bankruptcy, Les breaks the rule and tears up the ticket. Later, Les' boss chews him out for having such a soft heart. Our modest but unassuming hero lives alone and has no friends other than two geeks who own a comic book store. Les worries that he is too old to be reading comic books, but these simple-minded sagas fuel his avid fantasies. It isn't long after he ingests the medication that its side effects kick in and his life takes some dramatic turns. While eating cereal on his sofa and watching television, Les levitates in the air. Mind you, he doesn't rise very high off the cushions, but he ascends high enough to blow his mind. Suddenly, Les imagines that the pills have unlocked his latent superhero powers.

Actually, Dr. Dobson (Jack Kehler of ""The Big Lebowski"") explains that Les is on a new experimental antidepressant which ""inhibits the brain chemical responsible for self-doubt."" Initially, Haberman and Passmore let our hero imagine that he is a super hero who can leap off a desk and hover above the floor. Indeed, we--the audience--buy into Les' delusion because we see it from his perspective. At first, ""Special"" is a lot of fun because we want to believe what Les believes, but Haberman and Passmore evoke our suspicions that Les is not only fooling himself but us, too. The co-directors let Les get away with a couple of things amid all the other things that he doesn't get away with. When Les runs through a wall, he vanishes into the wall. Afterward, however, he reappears with bruises and blood stains on his head. Haberman and Passmore seem intent of confusing us about the reality and illusion of Les' delusions. Dr. Dobson wants to administer an antidote, but Les feels that it will divest him of his super powers.

Believe it or not, Les insists he is indestructible. Our deluded protagonist starts cruising town in a goofy 'Special' super hero outfit with the name of the drug manufacturer on his back. Les looks like a mental patient on the loose. He tackles people in stores who he mistakes as shoplifters. These misguided stunts win him a segment on the local newscast. The scene where he tries to turn himself in at the LAPD is hilarious. Les thinks that he can read the minds of those people around him. Basically, everything that Les does backfires on him, except on two occasions. He saves a supermarket clerk from a gunman and recovers a woman's purse from a thief. Eventually, the financial backers of the pharmaceutical company that invented the medication, the Exiler Brothers, Jonas (Blackthorne) and Ted (Ian Bohen), try to kill him because his hallucinatory behavior will discredit them. Les calls them 'the suits' and they become his arch-enemies. At one point, they use their dark, sinister automobile as a battering ram to run over him not once but twice!

The redeeming thing about ""Special"" is that there are probably people out there like Les who might imitate his behavior under similar circumstances. Sadly, ""Special"" emerges as a little less than special because Haberman and Passmore dream up subplots and then dump them. The possibility of a romance between Les and a supermarket cashier with her own problems fails to materialize. One wonders whether Haberman and Passmore realized that they were channeling a combo of the 1968 Cliff Robertson movie ""Charly,"" based on the novel ""Flowers for Algernon"" as well as M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable."" Instead, Passmore has stated that the movie ""Jackass"" inspired him. Unmistakably, ""Special"" deconstructs the way the media and our culture affect certain types of impressionable individuals.",1268784000,2,4913,5.091811414392059

Watching this movie was kind of like working on a puzzle, and the viewer has to solve it. The lead actor was excellent and the story was, well... strange but intriguing. I don't know anything about the behind the scenes issues with this movie, but I'd guess it was low budget, independent film because of the style of shooting and the quirkiness of the story.

'Special's low budget is more than obvious, however, the sum is greater than the parts with this cinematic gem.  This movie had me laughing, gasping, holding my breath and wiping my tears.

The movie embodies many of the superhero myths, while also embracing the awkward, sardonic and melancholic mood of an independent film.  Les Franken, a stereotypical comic fanboy, gains super abilities while taking an experimental anti-depressant.  Les attempts heroism with a deceiving new lease on life, and ends up fighting in the most epic battle he's ever faced, most of which takes place within his mind.  His sense of reality and self is challenged in almost every way.  Poor self-esteem being Les's ultimate weakness, his ego is the only thing holding him back from facing down his antagonists and psychological demons.

The film has a subtle message on the ethics of the pharmaceutical industry, or lack their of, but 'Special' ends with a much more profound lesson about a man's resolve.. the will to not be defeated, and what it means to be a hero, even if it's just your own.

A small pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug that promises to make its users unique, and an ordinary guy (Michael Rappaport) signs up.  He begins to notice changes very quickly, and is certain that with his new powers he can change the world.  But not everyone wants him to have powers, and men in suits are out to get him; even some of his friends refuse to believe in him when confronted with the evidence.

This is a small and subtle film about an ordinary lonely guy who needs to believe in himself.  Michael Rapaport is convincing in the lead role, though most of the other characters are underdeveloped.

The settings and lighting are spare and appropriate, but the handheld camera seemed at odds with the formalistic and tight framing of the shots.  Sometimes handheld lends an aura of authenticity - but here given the scarcity of camera movement, it seemed odd they didn't put the camera on a tripod.

-----------------------------------
This is an intense, and rather depressing film about a mild-mannered Joe Schmoe (wonderfully played by Michael Rapaport) who thinks he has tapped into his hidden superpowers after he takes part in an experimental drug program. Is what he experiences real or not? Well, the film actually answers this question immediately: he is in fact delusional, but because his delusions involve a sense of power and invulnerability, he soon places himself in great physical danger.

Rapaport is quite good in this role, giving a moving, multi-layered performance, and he is generally matched by his supporting cast. (Particularly strong are his schlubby friends, who own a comicbook store -- their reactions to the announcement that their friend has superpowers is *not* what you'd expect.) Although towards the finish, this film becomes unrelentingly bleak and harsh, it is an interesting exploration of the psychology and mythology of ""specialness"" which pervades American culture. Are we all special? Should we hope to be?  Here's one perspective that you might not have seen before... And certainly a strong role for Rapaport, whose puppy-dog qualities have seldom been used so well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film blog)",1240876800,11,1275,5.528205128205128

8322483,5,B001MYIXAM,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.  Especially like the subgenre where flawed but basically good hearted people try to become superheroes...and struggle at it lol  But really, who hasn't ever wanted to have special powers and defeat the people who bully you in life?  Great empowerment fantasy.

Related to the protagonist so much.  So if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1372,4.742616033755274
8322484,4,B001MYIXAM,"Low budget, smartly written, with stand out performances from actors committed to their roles, this is an awesome indie film with a premise that sets up what should be a satirical take on modern society, pharma, and big business. Instead it takes us on a funny, sad, poignant ride that shows the resiliency of the human spirit and the deeply ingrained desire to matter even in the face of a crowded, anonymous, and largely indifferent world.",1487289600,,441,4.815789473684211

8322489,2,B001MYIXAM,"This was not at all what I was expecting. I thought it would be a quirky and fun take on a man who gains superpowers, but there is nothing fun about this movie.  It's very sad and depressing.  The only laughs this movie provides is when Les runs himself into walls thinking he can phase through them, but the movie is so serious you just feel bad for him.  What is happening to him as a result of the drug testing is really, really awful.  The ending is left open to too much interpretation for my taste.  I found myself wanting to know about the repercussions of this story than the story itself, and without that it left me very unsatisfied.

For those that like this kind of open ended story telling, it's not a bad movie.",1460332800,4,725,4.255474452554744
