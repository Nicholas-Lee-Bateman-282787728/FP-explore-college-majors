7960920,4,B000065B0J,Cheese goodness! I wasn't expecting much and was greatly surprised by how decent this was. It wasn't as low budget as I was thinking. It was odd and awesome.,1432944000,,157,4.448275862068965
7960921,3,B000065B0J,"A far-fetched fantasy comedy that works.  I truly enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek fantasy comedy.  It's the same old story...what if you make a wish and it comes true?  You'll need to face the music.  And that's what this is all about.  Nothing serious here...just fun...just lots of fun, fun, fun.",1268611200,,295,4.938775510204081

Maybe it is the spooky looking cover art that convinced me this movie might be an excellent excursion into the dark recesses of the human soul. Just as likely a culprit in giving me this impression was the theme of witchcraft as a major plot point. As I popped the disc in the player, I inwardly steeled myself for a low budget version of ""The Craft"" or some similar teeny-cheesy dalliance with the world of horror cinema. I was wrong on all counts. Not only is ""Equinox Knocks"" in no way a horror movie (unless you think the idea of a girl waking up transformed into a guy is scary, and it very well could be), it isn't cheesy or in any respects lame. It is a teen movie, albeit a very warped teen movie philosophically akin to ""Heathers"" rather than most of the mindless blather out there. It is also a comedy, and a very funny one at that. I mentioned the movie to several people since I watched it, people that know a bit about obscure movies, and was quite surprised they hadn't heard of it. Heck, there aren't even that many reviews of this film out there. 'Tis a shame, I say.
Allie Black's (Katherine James) life is a mixture of the good and the bad. The good involves her relationship with the star of the football team, a very big deal considering she lives in Texas, a state known for its idolization of the pigskin. Unfortunately, the bad is starting to outweigh the good. Allie soon discovers her boyfriend is cheating on her with school snob Lynette. She also encounters some interference, along with a bit of gender discrimination, from the school guidance counselor over her plans to attend Harvard after graduation. Moreover, her mother, the town cop, won't give Allie any freedom to do the things she wants to do. Fed up with her life, Black seeks commiseration from her best friend and practitioner of witchcraft Courtney (Debra Cassidy), but she's too busy working up some esoteric conjurations for the autumn equinox to waste time listening to her pal's teenage gripes. Right in the midst of her friend's worship ceremony, Allie audibly wishes she could be a boy. If only she were a male, all her problems would end. And wouldn't you know it? The following morning Allie Black is no longer Allie Black. Instead, she is now a member of the testosterone brigade. The problems begin immediately.
Allie must now fit into a male world. Taking the name Caleb James (no longer Katherine James but now Guilford Adams) on the spur of the moment when confronted by Lynette and her blonde followers, Black works hard to overcome her difficulties. What follows are somewhat predictable, but still funny, scenes of cinematic gender switching. James must act like a transfer student while desperately seeking a way to switch back to her former self. When Caleb discovers he has a talent for football, he joins the team and becomes the star player. That means using the boys' locker room in several hilarious scenes that lead the rest of the school to cast serious aspersions on what gender he prefers to associate with. It also means a recruiter from Harvard shows up with an offer to play ball for the Ivy League school (does Harvard have a football recruiter?). In the meantime, Courtney and James hatch a plot to get back at Lynette and her coiffed followers. It's all a lot of fun, if occasionally predictable.
What makes ""Equinox Knocks"" different is its eccentric attitude. Every character is a total oddball, from the over the top guidance counselor to the hyper masculine football coach. Lynette and her followers, who all have names ending in -ette, are a real hoot. Check out that walk Lynette pulls at the grocery store. Must be some sort of Texas two-step stomp through the aisles! Also keep a lookout for Caleb James's boss at the seedy motel. There is something definitely not right with this chap. Perhaps the only normal character in the film is Allie Black's mother, a cop who is not about to give up on finding her daughter. The characters nearly attain camp levels with their performances, which isn't too bad considering nearly all of them never acted in anything other than this film. The movie occasionally drags, and some of the gags definitely don't work. I thought the addition of the astrologer/warlock character that rides into town and occasionally makes an appearance thereafter never really fit into the film. I also thought the film took on a looser structure as it progressed, with some scenes feeling like they were slapped together, but ultimately there is so much to laugh at that it doesn't matter. I even like that song that plays over the chapter selections!
The biggest flaw here is the DVD. The picture quality is atrocious. Colors wash out frequently, and the picture is hazy. Extras include a commentary track and short introduction from director Francine Rzeznik, a trailer, and an audition tape of Debra Cassidy and Guilford Adams. Even though I had some quibbles with the presentation of the film, I really think ""Equinox Knocks"" is a winner. I have a warped sense of humor that meshes well with a film like this one. It's not for everybody, but if you think gender reversal fused with Texas high school football has enormous comedic potential, give this one a shot.",1085270400,2,5321,4.716433941997852
7960923,5,B000065B0J,"This movie is a must see! I have recommended it to all of my friends and think it is appropriate for my kids to watch (12 and over).  Guilford Adams was so funny, we just love him here in Tuscon.  In fact, we have been hoping to find other fans and start up a little fan club for Guilford since he is just such a cutie!  I have been so thrilled with this movie.  Enjoy.",1057795200,,369,3.88
7960924,5,B000065B0J,"Don't be fooled, this is no horror movie and doesn't really claim to be. It's a comedy at heart, much in the vein of the 80's comedy ""Teen Witch"" with a funny, original, and unique plot. Destined to become a cult classic to those in the know. This DVD edition displays the film in a Widescreen presentation with Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound. It also features the movie trailer, director's introduction to the movie, Guilford Adams audition footage, and a full-length director's audio commentary. The video and audio on the DVD are excellent, I made a wise purchase by buying this to upgrade from the old VHS tape!",1028419200,,615,4.703703703703703
