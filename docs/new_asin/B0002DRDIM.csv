2080845,4,B0002DRDIM,I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. I figuired I could watch it over the course of two days. Well I was pleasantly surprised when I put the DVD in and 2 hours later I was still watching in amazement. They did a great job of presenting an overview of the History of our Team! I enjoyed it soo much I even got that familiar jumpy feeling in my stomache from watching some of the incredible game footage. And I warn you for all you serious football in your face gridiron Fans there is no shortage on the action! This DVD is a must have for  Eagles fans young and old. Hey! Are we not the best football fans in the world or what? E-A-G-L-E-S!!!! Now go get your copy!!!,1152230400,4,677,4.128787878787879
2080846,4,B0002DRDIM,"A must have for Eagles fans, but I felt like the longer I watched it the faster it moved.

It examines in great depth and detail through the teams history, all the way up until about the end of the Dick Vermeil Era. After that, it just tears though about the next 25 years. There's no mention at all of Marion Campbell taking over the team and very little examination of Norman Breman's disastrous ownership. Both Buddy Ryan and Ray Rhoades seem to only warrant extended footnotes, while Rich Kotite is almost skipped over entirely. At this point I felt that NFL films was trying WAY too hard to start looking at the franchise (and current ownership) through rose-colored glasses.

Granted, in the grand scheme of their history, this is probably just a small piece. I'm twenty-eight though; these are the years I remember best. It was disappointing that this part of the team's history was so abbreviated.

In all though, there's just a treasure chest of material here that I had a blast pouring over. I can't possibly not recommend it, it just loses a star for such a quick wrap-up.",1122940800,5,1083,4.630208333333333
2080847,4,B0002DRDIM,"I have been an Eagles fan since I was 6 years old in 1963.  There was a lot to like but a lot got left out.  I particularly was disappointed by the amount of the DVDs that consisted of talking heads, particularly when many of those heads had not worn an Eagles helmet -  who buys this to hear Philadelphia media people?  I would have preferred much more game action and much more on Eagles personalities.  Tim Rossovich, Bill Bradley, Bill Bergey, Tom Dempsey, Harold Jackson, Irving Fryar - never mentioned and barely seen.  Herschel Walker's 90/90/90 season - unmentioned but showing those three plays would have taken only about 30 seconds.  Too much of DVD 2 is just about the Vet and people who live in South Philly.  That's a little tangential to fill up half the set.  On the plus side, they do show due respect to Randall's greatest plays, to the Fog Bowl and to the incredible 1991 defense, so there are definitely some choice moments here.  On to the Super Bowl in Detroit next year and may the Eagles win it all!  I look forward to all Eagles DVD's and may they all get better and better!",1108598400,8,1099,4.417910447761194
2080848,5,B0002DRDIM,"What a fantastic DVD!! For a lifelong Eagles fan, it's a dream come true to be able to see this fantastic display of the mighty Eagles teams through the years. From the Bowl winning teams in the seventies right through to the unbeatable team of the present-containing such greats as Donovan McNabb, Brian Dawkins, Terrell Owens, Todd Pinkston and Brian Westbrook. These guys know how to get stuff done. They're almost guarenteed a playoff place this year, and they've only played eleven. Take note you crazy Baseball fans. This is how you play a real sport.
 The thrill of pulling off A huge deep pass play in your new kicks to win the superbowl, burning a DB for an 80-yard reception, finding the gap for 40 rushing yards, nailing your kick from 50+ yards, hitting the hurdle and Mike Vick spin move again and again, so the opponents can't get near you and you run it in for 60+ points. That feeling cannot be beaten. Trust me. I'm an Eagles fan.-Plus, you get to see all the cowboys QB's getting their heads mashed. What a rush, foo!",1102377600,11,1035,4.53475935828877
2080849,5,B0002DRDIM,"I love this DVD set its worth every penny, and I have shared it with friends. I am actually able to re-watch sections because I found it so fascinating. As a history buff and a huge Eagles fan, this was so exciting to me, and it did not disappoint. For those who like the good old days, the history of the team is there. For younger people like me, its a way of discovering your roots. And for current fans, its a way to live some of our favorite plays such as 4th and 26. I also enjoyed some of the special features. I'd like to be able to show my kids the footage of the vet implosion someday, for example. Highly recommended for purchase for the true fan. If you are a casual fan, you might not like it to purchase, but at the price, rent it and decide!",1101859200,10,756,4.046666666666667
2080850,5,B0002DRDIM,"This video provides the most comprehensive, well articulated history of the ""birds"" ever assembled.  The film footage, interviews and insights combine to provide the viewer with non-stop joy regarding our local franchise.

  I am a lifelong resident of the Philadelphia area, a ""dyed-in-the-green-wool EAGLES fan and a believer in the fact that ""good things come to those who wait"".  This DVD is a ""must own"" for any true EAGLES fan.",1097971200,8,433,5.128571428571429
2080851,5,B0002DRDIM,Top of the line DVD about your favorite team! Plenty of highlight reel clips from the 80 Super Bowl and great clip of the Buddy Ryan years! A must have for any Eagles fan!,1096934400,6,171,4.0588235294117645
2080852,5,B0002DRDIM,"This is the best DVD that I now, and will ever, own. The vaults of NFL films have been meticulously scoured to present anything to do with the Eagles franchise. The quality and quantity of the material from the 30-70s is astounding. You really get a feel for how the Eagles became Philadelphia's most beloved franchise.

The extra in-depth focus on the greats including Wilbert Montgomery, Leonard Tose, Bert Bell and actually seeing players like Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Bucko Kilroy and Tommy McDonald in action make these disks a must for any younger fan who ""bleeds Eagle green"". Considering the fact that the home base of NFL films is just outside Philadelphia, I doubt that such an expansive library of film is available for any other pro sports franchise. Do yourself a favor a pick up a copy today for hours and hours of E-A-G-L-E-S-Eagles!!",1095638400,18,872,4.8133333333333335
2080853,5,B0002DRDIM,"Well, NFL Films has done it again.  Their recent anthology on the Philadelphia Eagles History is a must for any fan of the franchise.  There's something for every fan, young and old, given they cover the entire reign of the club from their beginnings in 1933 to the demolition of Veterans Stadium.

As a long time fan of the team and their history, I was happy to see first time video on such great players as Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Concrete Charlie and such great coaches as Bert Bell, Greasy Neal, Buck Shaw.

The DVD set is complete with additional special features including profiles of Wilbert Montgomery, Reggie White, Veterans Stadium, the Fog Bowl...the list goes on and on.

Do yourself a favor and get this if you are a fan of the team.....if for no other reason, to see some Cowboys QBs getting their heads taken off.",1094774400,40,853,4.5855263157894735

If you are a NFL fan of the overall you will appreciate the packaging that NFL Films produced here.
