Yet it's not how we are living our lives.  Jack reminds us, in plain terms, that we hold the reins in our own lives.  If we don't like an aspect of our lives, we have the power to change it!  And he tells us how to do it.  Whether you struggle with personal relationships, weight, finances, your job, your kids or your happiness; all are within your power to change.

It's a must read, truly.",1276905600,2,538,4.267326732673268
