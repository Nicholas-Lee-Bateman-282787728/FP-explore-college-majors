8453737,5,B0052AXLI6,"I now own 33 volumes of Grandes Peleas and vol. 47 is all together different than any other volumes i have watched. All the previous volumes Show complete fights of some of the top boxers of our time( mostly Latin American favorites.). This one shows a long highlight real with some of the greatest fights of both Julio Cesar Chavez and Manny Pacquiao. Plus a short movie about Chavez. It starts out with Don King giving a 10 minute narrative of praising Mexican fighters and Julio Cesar Chavez. Then a short movie about chavez in spanish ( I can understand very little but i get the picture.). Then Hightlight reals of Julio and pacmans biggest fights. Then highlights of Pacquiaos' biggest shortcomings in the ring(none of Chavez's losses,a little biased maybe.) and then Believe or not a computer animated fight between Manny Pacquiao and J.C. Chavez called a virtual duel. Interesting concept! I enjoyed it and it was well done. The only English Commentary is that of Don King and Pacquiao highlights. The rest is in spanish and a little in tai.(One of Mannys fights.)",1349308800,3,1072,4.8
