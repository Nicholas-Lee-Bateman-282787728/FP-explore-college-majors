8324653,2,B00004THNM,"I've bought a number of publications on playing piano by ear and I can tell you right now that video series in not the greatest. though it was a fairly good tool showing the basics of listening and playing back. the same type of instruction can be found on some of the cheaper videos like ""Play Blues Piano by Ear."" I've found the the best way to learn is through some of the books which have been published on this topic. I recommend ""You Can Teach Yourself Piano by Ear"" for one thing, it's [inexpensive] and it goes over the same stuff that this video discusses just at 1/20 the price.",991008000,8,588,4.306306306306307
