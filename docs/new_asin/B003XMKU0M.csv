4218595,4,B003XMKU0M,"Long awaited complete series on DVD. Good entertainment, especially if you are a Harley fan and also enjoy watching Lorenzo. I also enjoyed seeing all the famous stars taking part in `Cameo Parts` through out the seasons. Shame it was discontinued in `97. Bike still looks good even after all the years.",1291766400,2,303,4.846153846153846
4218596,5,B003XMKU0M,"Renegade was a great, very entertaining show. Several big name stars make appearances. Johnny Cash, Linda Blair, Angie Harmon and Megan Pryce to name a few. The series was like an updated version of the classic tv show The Fugitive. Lots of action and humor and beautiful girls to enjoy. I was worried like several other Renegade fans, that we would never get Seasons 4&5 on dvd after such a long time had passed since Seasons 2&3 were released. It has been worth the wait. Renegade was filmed in my hometown of San Diego & San Diego County and provides some great scenery. If you're a Renegade fan go get this NOW! If youve never seen Renegade, go get this NOW! You will love it. One thing about this show is that each episode leaves you feeling uplifted. I always feel good after watching an episode. Warning: You Will Become Addicted To This Show but, at least now you can see every episode over and over again. I highly recommend this show. My favorite show of the 90s.",1289865600,47,973,4.47191011235955
4218597,5,B003XMKU0M,It took forever but its finally here!!!!! I finally can enjoy season 4 and 5....Great price for the whole series....It's a great gift for anyone this holiday....Sit back and enjoy the ride...,1289779200,,191,5.0
4218598,5,B003XMKU0M,"Absolutely top notch tv show.....funny, action packed, great camaraderie, imaginative stories and of course contains the best character in any tv or movie screen ever (in my opinion anyway) a Mr Bobby Sixkiller.

Being from Uk I never got the chance to see seasons 4 and 5...so grateful that amazon.com can provide the whole box set.

Personal favorite episodes of mine were...""Stalkers Moon"", ""Hitman"" and the hilarious ""Den of Thieves"".",1288310400,7,438,5.242857142857143
4218599,5,B003XMKU0M,"I bought seasons 1-3. Getting the last two seasons for $35.00 is well worth it even though I bought the others and will have duplicates. These shows provide hours of pleasant entertainment without the darkness and nerve jangling of newer productions. I wish they could bring this series back, old TV- I miss it. My only lament is I will eventually run out of Renegade shows.",1287878400,11,374,4.681818181818182
4218600,5,B003XMKU0M,I have been emailing Stephen J Cannell for years bugging him about releasing the final 2 seasons of Renegade. I'm sad to see him go but I'm grateful that they were able to make this happen before he died. I love this show. But jeez what's with the cover? If people see that in my DVD collection they'll assume it's gay porn.,1287014400,9,324,4.241935483870968
4218601,4,B003XMKU0M,"Well if it is true that all the seasons will be on the box set great. I just got season 1 and the dvd for one of the discs kept on going and stopping and then i went to the second disc and played great. So i really hope that this does happen again. Just like on Season 3 of the A-team there are discs that don't play at all. I mean you have to clean the dics to make sure they play. Also this is not a bad price but i really hope that the dics are not front and back.
Well Not that happy with the box, each dvd comes in a paper like disc holder and holds one dvd for each show or shows then yes there are 5 seasons in the box but i thought at least they would have put the dvds in a better quality of show ready and in slim cases not one disc after another. I mean you have to touch the dvds to get them out boo. I will give the show good ratings but not the box set. I say if you have all the seasons keep them. If you have some then it is up to you to get all the seasons. Good price bestbuy not bad. So if you have some seasons like i said before seprate that is much better. GOOD LUCK. Glad it came with 5 seasons.",1285804800,8,1118,3.6431535269709543
4218602,5,B003XMKU0M,"Well I had finally gotten my dvd box set of Renegade the Complete Series and honestly I was in fear of having any one of the dvds either broken or cracked during the delivery but thankfully the set had arrived alright and watching both seasons 4 & 5 brings back memories and they also included a cover over the orignal dvd box set so i m gonna keep it & frame it as well. I just also want to say thanks to Amazon for never letting me down about any product on here from movies, books, music, computer & video games; I'd say this is the most greatest site to ever puchase all of the above no matter what. Thanks Amazon!!",1284854400,30,619,4.12396694214876
4218603,5,B003XMKU0M,"Okay.. I just picked up from Best Buy for $29.99.. (Best price on this)...  I already had all 5 seasons so I just wanted to verify all the Seasons...  They are all there.

My thoughts:

Package is cheap.. 20 Discs.. in black paper. all 1 sided ..

All in order.. Quality of picture is pretty good overall..",1283990400,3,306,4.298245614035087
4218604,4,B003XMKU0M,"""He was a cop and good at his job.  But then he committed the ultimate sin and testified against other cops gone bad.  Cops that tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead.  Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands, an outlaw hunting outlaws, a bounty hunter--a RENEGADE"".  Do not hesitate to purchase RENEGADE--available on DVD in its entirety at long last from Mill Creek Entertainment!  RENEGADE is creator Stephen J. Cannell's take on THE FUGITIVE--with a '90's twist!  (Cannell was a long-time friend and creative collaborater with FUGITIVE creator Roy Huggins).  RENEGADE aired for 5 seasons (1992-97) with 110 episodes produced.  I also HIGHLY recommend Lorenzo Lamas' one-season TV series THE IMMORTAL and his sci-fi movie TERMINAL JUSTICE (both productions are available on DVD).  The first four seasons of RENEGADE aired in syndication, while season five aired exclusively on the USA Network.  The following is a complete list of all 110 episodes of RENEGADE.
RENEGADE--Starring Lorenzo Lamas as Reno Raines/Vince Black, Branscombe Richmond as Bobby Sixkiller, Kathleen Kinmont as Cheyenne Phillips (Seasons 1-4), Sandra Ferguson as Sandy Carruthers (Season 5) and Stephen J. Cannell as Lt. Donald ""Dutch"" Dixon.  A Stephen J. Cannell Production!

Whoever put this shoddy packaging together should be ashamed, and it's also disrespectful to this great show to package it the way they did.

When I received package, I knew it would have all of the seasons on DVD, but I didn't expect it to be on so many discs, or that each disc would be in a paper slip cover with a plastic window stacked on top of each other. There are 20 discs, and though they are stacked but fit in to a cut out in case, there are so many that it is easy to drop them out of it and out of slipcover.

Shows like this are what made the 90's fun.  Nobody watches television shows like Renegade because it's super high class quality television.  Reno Raines is a believable hero/antihero and you root for him in every show.  and now you can have the entire series in one set.

I see a bunch of negative reviews for this product based on the packaging, that each DVD in the set comes in a small paper sleeve which is stacked inside the case neatly, rather than separate small plastic cases.  Really?  could we be a little more environmentally aware here?  this package saves space on my shelves AND I don't feel so bad about all that plastic.  The paper sleeves work fine for me.

Long and the short of it is, I bought this set because it's eye candy for me to sit and watch me some long haired Lorenzo Lamas from the BEST era of his acting career.

My big complaint however is the quality of the dvd's. In my copy there is about 15 episodes (out of 110) that cannot be watched as they continually seize every few seconds, impossible to watch and understand. However I have got around this by taking down the season and episode number and watching it on ""youtube"". it seems that some dear soul has put all the series on youtube.",1409443200,,525,4.479166666666667

After getting this box I opened the box were it came in just to check if the complete series were there and to make sure that none of them came broke or damaged. Glad to say that they all arrived in prefect condition. The disks I played appeared to be playing well and hopefully these will be the case for the rest of the disks.

As I watched these old show you can tell they are filmed many years ago, I mean todays show have higher quality and better acting, stories and stunts but I expected that so I wasn't too disappointed. what really ticked me off was the fact the the dvds seemed to have been made in someone's basement and it still smelled like freshly burned homemade DVDs . In the Renegade complete series the case which held these disks were just so poorly made and very cheap . you have to be very careful with it since the box does not closes securely. There is a tape that hold it closed firmly but once its removed the box remains slightly loose and the disks can spill out. I also uploaded some images.",1402099200,8,1196,4.334821428571429

He already had previously purchased and viewed the first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons could not be purchased separately.  The price was right, so I purchased the complete series for him. This was originally a television series and at the time of its airing, the recipient was often not able to watch it even though it was one of his favorite shows.  The Renegade is an ex-cop motorcyclist who still seeks to help others but always seems to run into some trouble of his own.

4218702,5,B003XMKU0M,"The Renegade TV show was 90's television at it's best. Renegade stars Lorenzo Lamas as Reno Raines an undercover cop who was framed for murder by dirty cops, and he goes on the run trying to prove his innocence with help from Bobby Sixkiller and Cheyenne Philips. They both are bounty hunters and Reno ends up partnering with them, catching bounties all the while having a bounty hanging over his own head. The great thing about this series is that it will leave you in suspense with each episode, wondering whether or not Donald (Dutch) Dixon who framed Raines for murder is going to catch him or will any other law enforcement agency bring him down.

This series lasted five seasons and for good reason. If you like shoot'em up story lines with martial arts action, beautiful women, motor cycles, mysteries, American Indian culture, and a plethora of nuances then this hit TV show is for you. Renegade is somewhat of an amalgam of The Fugitive, The Lone Ranger, Easy Rider and Kung Fu. So, if you liked those shows and movies, then it's a safe bet you'll love Renegade!
So pop some popcorn, pour a glass of lemonade and sit back because you're in for some extreme wild adventures. This is must watch TV folks.",1385769600,,1211,4.606481481481482

4218761,1,B003XMKU0M,"We just cancelled cable and decided we could afford to buy some made for TV series to watch rather than the ""reality TV"" trash that seems to be dominating the networks today.

To be fair, we haven't watched the entire series yet so hopefully there are some improvements as the series matures, but here are a few observations on what we've seen so far (most of the first season):

The acting is EXTREMELY cheesy - especially from Lorenzo Lamas.  It's pretty bad when the star of the show rountinely gets out-acted by walk on roles.

I suppose if you're teenage girl all the gratuitous shots of Lamas with his shirt off or in muscle shirts, etc. and references to ""that good looking guy"" are a draw, but IMHO it gets rather tiresome. We get it, the dude's cut and handsome, why the need to continually remind the audience of this.

Plus, as a motorcycle enthustiast (which is why I bought the series to begin with) I think the riding scenes are WAY cheesy - especially the night scenes where he's riding and having flashbacks.  I mean it's so totally cheesy it actually circles back around to being slightly amusing.

The character Bobby Sixkiller is almost as cheesy as Lamas, only Richmond (the actor who plays Sixkiller) isn't quite as bad an actor as Lamas.  With this guy the whole Captialistic/Indian schtik gets a bit tiresome as well.

That said, one positive on this is that there is surpisingly very little foul language and it's certainly something you can let the kids watch.  I think it's a fairly wholesome show with a positive message if you can ignore the bad acting and the obvious impracticalities of EVERYONE (except the bad guys who naturally always get foiled in the end) on the show ignoring the fact that this guy is an accused cop killer and giving him a pass after they ""get to know him and know he could never have done that"".

Me?  If I had it all to do over again, I wouldn't buy it unless I could get it REALLY cheap, but since we have it we're going to go ahead and continue the series to see if the acting gets any better - I'm giving it a deadline of the end of Season Two (which is waaaaay more latitude than I would have given it as a first run network show) for it to get better then we're done.  Keep an eye out for us selling it as an ""almost new"" set.

UPDATE:  OK, so I gave this series the benefit of the doubt and gave it 2 Stars at first, but now about 1/2 through the second season I'm downgrading it to 1 Star (and well earned I might add).  Believe it or not, the acting has actually gotten worse and the plots have gotten cheesier.

BUT - as the saying goes one man's junk is another man's treasure.  There are apparently many folks here who think this show is great.  I will be putting this series up for sale on either Amazon or E-Bay very soon.  It will be in excellent condition and would be a good buy for anyone who actually likes this show.",1310083200,6,2891,4.328385899814471
4218762,5,B003XMKU0M,"I sincerely thank whoever made the decision to publish seasons four and five of this very entertaining, if not too deep, series.  I tried never to miss a show and this from one who rarely watches tv.

I am not too familiar with all of Stephen Cannell's work but if you like motorcycles and adventure he surely hit a homerun with this show.  All of the cast is/was fantastic and I am surprised they didn't collect a number of awards.

Even though I had seasons one through three it was great to get the entire series in one package.

This show is really special for those with old fashioned values.  There are still good guys trying to do the right thing even if only in a tv show.

Like a few other series long gone, I expect to watch and rewatch this the rest of my life.

The quality isn't that great (especially on a big screen tv/blu ray player), but it's not so bad that you can't watch/enjoy it. My problem is with the packaging. It's like a huge VCR tape box and all 20 DVDs are in single sleeves. 1 disc to a sleeve, then they are put all together in the tape box. It's a really cheap way to package an entire series. But that's my only complaint. If you really liked Renegade when it was on, I highly recommend this set. And at $33 and free shipping, it's well worth it!",1308960000,3,631,4.096774193548387

Also, Reno Raines gets Cleared of the Murder of Dutches Wife, but where does Reno stand on the Falsafied Conviction of the Killing of Buzy Barell, and does Cheyenne Phillips { Bobby Sixkiller's Sister } ever get the Good News abaout Reno?

I didn't get to see all of this sho when it was screened years ago in Austraalia they kept changing time slots which was not always at a time when I could view.

4218772,5,B003XMKU0M,"I grew up watching this show on the USA network and on a local station on saturday nights. It was on right after the first movie on USA up all night ended. I was a big fan of that network, and being 12 or 13 I liked anything with hot women in skimpy outfits. This show has a little of that in it but I liked seeing Reno Raines kick ass even more. Especially when it was Dutch Dixons. Series creator Stephen J. Cannell played my and Renos nemesis Sgt. Donald Dixon. Cannell plays this heartless and self serving character perfectly. Lorenzo Lamas miles away from Falcon Crest plays the hero and the hunted Reno Raines/Vince Black. He is befriended early on my a seemingly wealthy bounty hunter brother sister combo. Brandscombe Richmond plays the money hungry funny guy Bobby Sixkiller. Richmond has been in other stuff but all I remember is him getting squashed by Arnold in kindergarten cop. Kathleen Kinmont plays Cheyenne his sister. In short Reno is set up for a murder by Dutch and he goes on the run. Soon after he becomes Vince Black bounty hunter working for Sixkiller Entreprises. At every turn Reno runs into trouble. Either Dutch trying to kill him, or trying to bring in some punk with a bounty on his head or just one of the many small towns people who just don't take kind to motorcycles and long hair. Alot of episodes featured a damsel in distress Reno would save from the bad guy and in the end would payoff with a kiss. Richard Dawson kissed more women than Lamas got to but quality is better than quantity in this case since most of them are rather attractive. I'm looking forward to the episodes with Melora Hardin as I've never seen her in anything but the office. This is ten years before and she has to be super hot. The show is packed with action,drama,romance and some cheesy comedy. Everything you could want. This is five seasons spread over 20 discs. 115 great episodes. The good and the bad about the set itself is that it's cheap. Alot of entertainment for a cheap price but in trade a cheap presentation is what you get. The packaging sucks. 20 discs each in a sleeve to me is cheap and kind of stupid looking. Also I would say the video quality is only a few notches better than my taped off tv episodes. The keyword is better though, I just though on DVD it wouldve been a bit sharper. Anyway you cut it this is a fantastic complete series collection. Thank you mill creek for releasing this.

4218774,5,B003XMKU0M,"Amazon rates 4 stars for like and 5 stars for love.  I love bobby I love reno I like Cheyenne.

What's so great about this series are the relationships between the principals.  Both Lorenzo and Branscombe are fantastic guys (so so actors) but their humor and comfortable relationship shines through.  Sometimes its like they are not even saying lines.

Also what's great about this show are the incredible stunts.  I love the fact that the camera revels it's Lorenzo's face coming toward us and he hits the ground.  Branscombe got his start as a stunt coordinator and it shows in the series. Lorenzo's incredible footwork is so exciting!

And let us not forget the romance...a girl in every port, ah, make that town.  There is a strong romantic element in the series, as almost every episode has a heroine in peril, and of course our guy Reno is irrestiable.  Lamas is wonderful with these scenes.  My husand and I joke as we are watching the show that there are a LOT of women waiting for him to ""come back some day"".

Last but certainly not least is the other leading character of the show, the motorcycle.  Reno gets on his bike with his Indian blanket rolled up in front, his long hair blowing in the breeze, down the long curving road off into the sunset....
