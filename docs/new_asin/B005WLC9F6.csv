4899633,4,B005WLC9F6,I thought this was a pretty good movie. It has a lot of information as to how bad drugs are and that people should just stay away from illegal drugs.,1382054400,,149,4.0
4899634,1,B005WLC9F6,the plot is lacking and the actors aren't even trying; i do not recommend this movie unless you are looking for an indy movie type experience,1360972800,,141,4.461538461538462
4899655,3,B005WLC9F6,"Fascinating and horrifying at the same time.  It would scare me away from meth use, for sure.  Acting not the best, but worth a watch.",1447632000,,134,4.32
4899656,4,B005WLC9F6,"I was actually prepared for a pretty B rate movie, but was surprised to find descent acting, good plot with story line follow through and good casting.",1446768000,,151,4.62962962962963

4899659,5,B005WLC9F6,"I know this is an older movie, but I just watched this with my Prime membership.  I actually enjoyed it very much, though I see other reviews that are all over the place. I think it is a very realistic view of the drug culture - especially in the rural drug 'lab' scenes. As a former addict, 20 years clean, the behaviors and situations shown were spot on.  The movie easily held my interest, lots of interesting tensions going on.  Ethan's taunting of the volatile, gun waving Jesse was a nice touch. I also liked the actors, most were very believable, and I knew a few people like these characters in real life.  Ethan, Pamela, Jesse - oh, well, I should just say the whole inner circle of the drug house characters were very well acted, especially the actress portraying Pamela. Even with her fairly rapid progression to skankiness, I still ended up kind of liking her scrappiness, and felt surprisingly sympathetic to her throughout the movie.  I also liked that they showed the Lindsey character trying to keep clean with about the only way that works, totally staying away from former friends and hangouts. I liked the way the story filled in the back stories, Lindseys OD and
prior relationship with Ethan. To sum up, I would recommend this movie (obvi :)  Well, if anyone else watches this, and has any thoughts on the ""1 year later"" post script, I'd be interested to hear your take on it ;)",1426982400,,1399,4.576
4899660,1,B005WLC9F6,Terrible quality and bad acting. Only watched the first 10 minutes and changed it.,1420156800,,82,4.928571428571429
4899661,4,B005WLC9F6,"Very unusual movie. Some parts of it were pretty fake and campy, but others were spot-on to the world of the tweaker. One point is that the ""white dragon"" of the drug world is usually describing white heroin, specifically China white from southeast Asia. So I wasn't truly expecting, from the title, a movie about crystal meth. But it's still one of the best on that topic I've seen.",1413590400,,383,4.565217391304348
4899662,5,B005WLC9F6,Great indie film about chasing the white dragon. Drugs are bad! Shot really well and great acting.  Check it out.,1412035200,,113,4.65
4899663,5,B005WLC9F6,"The movie showed the tragedy of chance,  especially the girl with the sore on her face.  I would have gone to the law as soon as my kid was kidnapped.  I take it the child was killed and what was in the bag.  Anyhow,  the irrational rants and the tension was in slow motion.  The acidic nature of the Meth world is just too crazy.  I feel this is a good movie.

The guy with the white truck was inches from gunning everyone down.  It was powderkeg that eventually blew out.",1409788800,,473,4.1098901098901095
4899664,5,B005WLC9F6,good insight to what the drug culture is like and its not a good thing,1405641600,,70,3.7333333333333334
4899675,1,B005WLC9F6,In was really disappointed with this movie. It seemed to me the producers were the real meth heads  the way the story wouldn't stay still,1405382400,,137,4.48
4899676,1,B005WLC9F6,Is this a comedy? It has to be..it was so bad it was funny. Hey lets go to Nashville and I'll be come a country music star and everything will be like we dreamed when we were kids and monkey's will fly outta my tweaked out ass. I would write a longer review but I'm no my way to Hollywood to become a star with only 5 bucks in my pocket and the clothes on my back.,1405123200,,364,3.74025974025974
4899677,1,B005WLC9F6,"Worst movie ever.  Bad acting, bad story, total waste of time.  This movie actually pissed me off its so bad.",1401580800,,109,4.4
4899678,3,B005WLC9F6,"Methamphetamine addiction doesn't have a 'bright side.' It consumes and destroys, ravaging the entire body. This doesn't delve deeply enough into the psyche nor does one see the acute phases of addiction. This substance can be prepared from legal ingredients that are easily available. Check the Internet for a 'recipe' to disaster . . . oh yes, it's there for those who know where to look. This video is within reason and perhaps some viewers might consider it a simple lesson of addiction. Find the 'positive' ending that can ofer a 'new beginning!'

For those of us who have tried and failed in an emergency room, it's unforgettable. Loss of life isn't that easy to accept and still the media helps keep this at a distance and subjective. There is no glamour to be found . . . if you want to try to begin and understand, this is a good introduction. Recommended as 'cautionary' and educational for those interested in human behavior and 'addiction' . . . a psychological profile simplified.

Recommended documentary: The Global Addiction [ABC Australia] presents a well narrated overview from the grower to the addict.",1398902400,,1121,4.894736842105263
4899679,3,B005WLC9F6,"This movie was okay it shows how most meth lab's are set up in rural areas and from courses I've taken through emergency services response in my state for disassembling these type labs.,
I found that most of the dialogue and scene settings made the movie in general look very realistic...",1398816000,,288,4.666666666666667
4899680,5,B005WLC9F6,"It is a nice movie, it shows the reality of meth. It is not a documentary, it is a story about the addiction of meth. A painful movie.",1397952000,,134,3.8214285714285716
4899681,1,B005WLC9F6,"One of the worst movies I have watched in awhile.  The acting, story and well...everything about this movie just ......stink!!!  Save your time and watch the paint dry......",1395705600,,173,5.142857142857143
4899682,5,B005WLC9F6,"I felt like, as a teen, I would have known some of these people. I understand it's an indie film and the actors aren't super polished, and the plot isn't very deep, but it's deep enough that they hooked me into their lives and I had to keep watching to see how it all came to the end. It was also a tear jerker and I was shocked in amazement especially at the end.

5 stars from me.  It's an example for students and teens that makes sense and is relateable.",1394150400,5,458,4.021978021978022
4899683,4,B005WLC9F6,"Pretty decent movie. One can tell there wasn't much of a budget to go by, but everything was done very well in my opinion. The film displays exactly what people shouldn't be doing, and how ruined and wasteful lives are when ""Chasing The White Dragon.""",1389052800,,251,4.6
4899684,4,B005WLC9F6,"This is a very dark tragedy film, detailing the beast. I thought the portrayal of an ugly and scary, hungry and mysterious lightning-type dragon monster that embraces and possesses its prey is spot on.

So many lives of people who don't do meth are ruined by those who chase the white dragon. The dragon possesses these people and they essentially lose their humanity, choosing instead death and destruction of everything and anything they have...their families, their children, their lives, their minds...just to get close to the dragon yet again.

Apparently, being introduced to the dragon brings the greatest of experiences for them, for they continue to chase the dragon trying to repeat that introductory meeting no matter what the cost. Yet, they never again get that experience no matter how much meth they do. It's sad, really. Once they've met and chased the dragon, they can never again experience normal joy or happiness, doomed to a lifetime of depression and angst.

I thought the psychotic breaks from reality scenes were very believable. I have seen this same behavior with my own son, who unfortunately chased the dragon and ruined many other lives as well as his own. I am grateful that my son didn't end up killing anybody else. His never-ending lust for the dragon yielded him close to 40 years in prison, a place he well deserves. A place whereby I and others are safe from the side effects of the never-ending lust.

This film recreates the angst, psychotic episodes, schizophrenic breaks, and the perpetual lusting for the dragon in an, unfortunately, true to life scenario. This is truly one of the worst American tragedies ever.",1386374400,19,1653,4.956678700361011
8487989,5,B005WLC9F6,"Very very good movie. Very dark, which given the subject, meth cooking and addicts lifestyle, is to be expected. It is not a really lavishly produced film, it is an indie movie so there wasn't millions spent, and it shows, but it is still a good one to see if you are interested in the subject matter. It is grim, pretty much realistic, and does NOT glamorize smoking meth AT ALL. Watching this makes you cringe often, but you cant stop watching - how will this end?

It is not a feel-good movie with an uplifting, happy ending, it is realistic - things go to shit in a spectacular fashion, although there is a peek of a happy outcome for two of the subjects at least. I personally found it a good movie, and I gotta say, if anyone who watches this has just started using meth, or is toying with the idea, this will squash that idea pretty fast, if the watcher pays attention!

Worth a watch if you can take the subject matter. I find addiction memoirs and movies fascinating, from the realistic ones like this, to Sondra Bullock in 28 days. This was one of the grimmest but riveting ones I have seen. Kind of a poor mans Trainspotting.",1516320000,,1136,4.35377358490566

8487991,5,B005WLC9F6,"This movie is by far the best addiction movie portrayed I've ever seen. My new fave band -one less reason- is featured in it, that is how I found them so I'm so thankful I watched this movie. The actors in this don't serm.likr their acting. It's heavy, sad, and shows u just how addicting meth is, and how it destroys everything and everyone around you.  Loved it.",1479600000,,364,4.352941176470588

8487994,5,B005WLC9F6,"I really didn't think I would care much from this Movie but it was free on Prime so gave it a shot. Having had a family member go to prison for ""cooking"" this showed several different people each in their own situations going downhill without knowing it all for that rush. I thought it was clever, leaving some things for US to have to sort of figure out (or just holes b/c I didn't get some scenes really or the timing of events)....such as the garbage bag at the end, and a few other scenes. It depicts the ""tweaking"" very well and the one so desperate as to steal from his Grandmother as she begs him not to take her last $$...that's their world. In the end the 2 making it out was not very realistic but hey it is a movie right? I fell for this little film, even the way they used the music was clever I thought. I even liked the visual with the ""white dragon"" and referring to ""evolving"" to keep up with a fast paced world. Yes I have watched it a couple of times and there were holes that left me wondering like what the chick got that was so much she allowed her child to be taken? The biggest problem to me was the bad acting, it was pretty bad but in a way I wanted to see what DID wind up happening to Ethan past the 1 year mark...did he just cook meth in another place as somebody else? No consequence to him at all? A very bad scene to me tho of the whole film was that the Detective walked right into the store where the chick was scoring Sudafed....didn't even try to be unseen by her, then they followed her car?! But really it was entertaining enough to look past those things and see that drug is a true death sentence in any Country.",1460592000,,1651,4.098765432098766
