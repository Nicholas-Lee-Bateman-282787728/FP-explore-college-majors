In SAY AGAIN YES I DO (aka I DO 2), one finds both. During the twenty episode run director Yang Bu Xin explores how in the first episode a couple meet, fall in love, quarrel, fall out of love and then spend the next nineteen episodes trying to get back on track. This summary sounds uncomplicated enough but thanks to a talented cast, the chemistry of the leads manages to overcome some pretty amateurish plot contrivances and logical gaffes.

  Shu Xin Kui (Mandy Wei) is a pretty female who literally bumps into Xiang Zheng Yang (Lin Yo Wei) under a mistletoe kiss and instantly fall in love. The numbers of lovers who meet and fall under a romantic spell like this are likely universally high; the problem arises after short term excitement dissolves and a lack of long term compatibility shunts aside all else. After their dissonant and acrimonious shouting matches end, they divorce, vowing never to see each other again. Of course, they do meet four years hence as they both enroll in the same hotel management training program. Rather than focus exclusively on the rocky reuniting of the leads, director Xin introduces a number of sub plots which by contrast eventually point toward the need of a couple to have more than a superficial attraction to or a compulsive addiction to another.

  Ji Shi Yu (Michael Zhang) the director of management training and Ge Qian Qian another manager trainee (Vivi Lee) is the first pair of lovers whose own initial failings parallel the misadventures of the leads.  Ge Qian Qian broke up with Ji Shi Yu four years earlier because she believed she could not give birth. She did not tell him the reason so he was understandably quashed. Their reunion is as bitter as that of Shu Xin Kui and Xiang Zheng.

  A second pair of mismatched lovers is Xiang Zheng again who years before his marriage to Shu Xin Kui had a ten year platonic relation with Liang Man Ni (Amanda Zhou), who was obsessively in love with Xiang Zheng but did not dare tell him for fear of losing him. Liang Man Ni emerges surprising enough as the most interesting character in the movie. She appears one way as a benevolent sort, slowly morphs to another less admirable secondary antagonist, finally emerging as the Vicious Harridan of Taiwanese drama. In her machinations, she is a cross between Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth and Iago. Liang Man Ni improvises her plots on the spot and her sheer power of will enables her to pull nearly all of them off.

  A third and less interesting counterpoint is a triangle between another manager trainee Omega (Jenny Huang) who is courted both by Dai Zhi Cheng (Yao Chun Yao) who shyly loves Omega and Lan Yan Hu (Wu Zhong Qiang) who, like Liang Man Ni, begins as sweet, morphs into brutishness, ultimately reforming back into sweetness.

  The three pairs of mismatched lovers crisscross at convenient points with all involved emphasizing that if a relation is to succeed, the assorted lovers must first look inward to see what they want before expecting their significant other to supply that want. The ending of SAY AGAIN YES I DO is an affirmation that enduring love is worth the considerable effort involved.",1465689600,,3294,4.752631578947368
